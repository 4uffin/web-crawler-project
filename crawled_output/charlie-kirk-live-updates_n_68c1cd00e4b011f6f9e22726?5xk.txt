Sep 13, 2025, 9:58 AM EDTAPPatel Faces Congressional Hearings After Missteps In Kirk Assassination Probe And Turmoil At FBIWASHINGTON (AP) — Hours after the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, FBI Director Kash Patel declared online that “the subject” in the killing was in custody. The shooter was not. The two men who had been detained were quickly released, and Utah officials acknowledged that the gunman remained at large.The false assurance was more than a slip. It spotlighted the high-stakes uncertainty surrounding Patel’s leadership of the bureau when its credibility — and his own — are under extraordinary pressure.Patel now approaches congressional oversight hearings this coming week facing not just questions about that investigation but broader doubts about whether he can stabilize a federal law enforcement agency fragmented by political fights and internal upheaval.Democrats are poised to press Patel on a purge of senior executives that has prompted a lawsuit, his pursuit of President Donald Trump’s grievances long after the Russia investigation ended, and a realignment of resources that has prioritized the fight against illegal immigration and street crime even though the agency has for decades been defined by its work on complicated threats like counterintelligence and corruption.Read more: Advertisement

Sep 12, 2025, 3:32 PM EDTLil KalishLGBTQ+ Advocacy Organization Blasts WSJ’s Early Reporting About Kirk ShootingThe Human Rights Campaign, a leading LGBTQ+ advocacy organization, denounced how major news outlets and online influencers quickly – and falsely – tied Charlie Kirk’s shooter to the LGBTQ+ community.On Thursday, The Wall Street Journal published a story describing the bullet casings as “engraved with transgender and antifascist ideology,” after citing an early bulletin shared by law enforcement. The words on the shell casings recovered by police demonstrate how the shooter was embedded in an online meme and gaming culture, though none of the wording related to trans people.Brandon Wolf, the press secretary for HRC, said that the Wall Street Journal and other media outlets’ reporting that linked the shooter with trans people was “reckless, irresponsible and led to a wave of threats against the trans community from right wing influencers, and a wave of terror for the community that is already living scared.”“Many online who peddled rumors with incomplete and untrue details did not care about the facts. They cared about inciting rage,” Wolf continued. “People’s rush to lob hot takes and click bait is not how we are going to get out of this deeply divided, dangerous era.”On Friday, the Wall Street Journal included an editor’s note at the top of its previous story, noting new information from the Justice Department and Utah’s Governor Spencer Cox. The editor's note states that the Justice Department urged caution about the earlier bulletin by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives saying “it may not accurately reflect the messages on the ammunition.” It goes on to note that Gov. Cox “gave no indication that the ammunition included any transgender references.”HRC is still calling on the Journal to issue an apology and a retraction for its coverage."Nowhere in their note did they acknowledge the damage their story caused nor the communities they put at risk," Wolf told HuffPost. "Nor did they acknowledge that one of the casings included an anti-gay marking. LGBTQ+ people — and transgender people in particular — are owed an apology."Advertisement
Sep 12, 2025, 2:29 PM EDTRyan GrenobleCharlie Kirk Shooter's Shell Casings Don't Suggest 'Trans Ideology.' Here's What They Do Mean.Shell casings recovered along with the weapon used to assassinate Charlie Kirk suggest the shooter was deeply familiar with internet meme culture, with three of the four casings inscribed with online lingo the average person would find inscrutable.Utah Gov. Spencer Cox (R) relayed the writing to reporters at a press conference Friday, where he also confirmed 22-year-old Tyler Robinson had been arrested as the prime suspect in the shooting.Earlier reporting, spread most prominently by The Wall Street Journal, described the casings as “engraved with transgender and antifascist ideology.” It’s unclear how the Wall Street Journal drew that conclusion, with the outlet citing an “early bulletin” that was shared among law enforcement. While two of the casings certainly allude to fascism, one potentially favorably, none of the messages are even remotely related to trans people.Read more:Advertisement
