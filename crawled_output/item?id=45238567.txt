Thank the fate for PC to exist!Open nature of PC allowed for truly free/open source software to exist which can be functional without big corporate lockdown. I can fully assemble it with parts I can buy individually and as long as they are compatible (which is mentioned on the box, no hidden knowledge here) I can expect it to work within the mentioned warranty.My PC based computers can be booted and fully functional with Debain, Fedora
and (put your favorite Linux, BSD distro here mine is openSUSE Tumbleweed). There is no parallel ecosystem which yet, which rivals PC in terms of open specs
and fully tinkerable hardware and software.Macbooks are locked down with Apple and forget about your own hardware.Android seemed like a competitor, but closed nature of its development and lack commodity hardware around ARM based phones means that FOSS layer exists only in user bases apps. We have custom ROMs which require bootable blobs from vendors and its non-reliable and breaks often.replypjmlp 1 hour ago

PC only got where it was thanks to the mistakes that made clones possible.Everyone else, including other IBM offerings, were all about vertical integration.It is no coincidence that nowadays with PC desktops being largely left to enthusiastics and gamers, OEMs are all doubling down on vertical integration across laptops and mobile devices, as means to recoup the thin margins that have come to be.replyrbanffy 4 hours ago

> First, IBM didn’t make the most of its dominance. It did little to make the IBM version of the PC truly unique.Remember IBM had gone through a very painful antitrust case and was still subject to the consent decree. I’m not sure right now of the terms, but it certainly limited the leverages IBM could apply against third parties profiting from the PC.replypaulajohnson 13 minutes ago

This reads like a case study from "The Innovator's Dilemma" by Clayton Christensen.TL;DR: big incumbents (e.g. IBM) get out-innovated and replaced by scrappy startups even when the incumbent sees it coming and tries to react. The incumbent's business processes, sales metrics (NPII in this story), internal culture and established customer base make it impossible for an innovative product to succeed within the company.The incumbent produces an innovative gadget. It may even be good, but its Sales Dept earn their quarterly bonus from the existing product line sold to the existing customers. They haven't got time to go chasing small orders of the new gadget from new customers who they don't have a relationship with, and the existing customers don't see the point of the new gadget. So orders for the gadget stagnate.Across town is the small scrappy start-up making a similar gadget. It lives on those small orders and has a highly motivated sales person who chases those orders full time. So their orders grow, their product improves from the market feedback, and one day the new gadget is actually better than the incumbent's main product. At that point the incumbent goes out of business.replycmrdporcupine 17 minutes ago

IBM tried to make a more thoroughly "IBM" proprietary PC product first with the PCjr and then especially with the PS/2. Attempted to lock down the hardware a bit more, introduced the Microchannel bus/architecture, etc.But it was too late, and they didn't have the power they thought they had.replySMAAART 2 hours ago

> IBM brought the quality of it’s support and it’s endorsement as a personal computer that was worthy of ‘serious’ businesses.

>I don’t think that culturally IBM ever really felt that the PC was a true IBM product.That was true everywhere.
I worked at a mini company at the time when the PC came out.
People in that company looked at the PC as a cool thing, but not a real computer.In 10 or so years, the PC killed of almost all mini computer companies.
Some even speculated that was the main reason for IBM to create the PC :)reply
