Walmart currently accepts online WIC purchases with cards issued in Washington & Massachusetts. Delivery address or pickup store for orders must be within the same state or territory issuing your benefits. What items are eligible for purchase with WIC? Add your WIC card to see which items are eligible for your prescribed benefits on your WIC Landing Page. For more information, please refer to your benefits prescription provided by your agency. You may also choose to search for items at Walmart.com, but note that items denoted as "WIC eligible" are under your agency’s Approved Product List & may not be eligible for purchase with your prescribed WIC benefits. Why can I only select certain pickup or delivery dates & times? Since WIC benefits expire every month, your order must be picked up or delivered before your benefits expire. For shipping, the estimated arrival date must be before your benefits expire. How can I tell which items are WIC eligible at Walmart.com? Add your WIC card to see which items are eligible for your prescribed benefits on the WIC landing page. Your agency-prescribed benefits may not include all items that have the “WIC eligible” badging. Can I choose which items are charged to my WIC card? No, Walmart will allocate all WIC-eligible items on your prescription to your WIC payment method. This automated allocation cannot be changed if you’re paying with WIC. How do I check my WIC balance? You can view your balance on the WIC landing page, which can be found within Services. Can I buy non-WIC eligible items with an alternative form of payment? Yes, you can buy non-WIC-eligible items in the same order as WIC-eligible items. At checkout, you will be able to pay with your WIC card & another form of payment. Please note, only one WIC card can be added & used per order. How do I check out with my WIC card? If your WIC card is already added to your account Wallet & you have eligible items in your basket, you will see the card listed as a payment method on the Review Order screen. Otherwise, select "Add new payment" or “Edit payment" to add your WIC card. There’s a maximum of one WIC card allowed per account. Can I make an edit after placing my order with WIC?Yes, you can make changes to a pickup or delivery order when it is still in the processing stage. Changes include adding or removing items, changing item quantities, editing substitution preferences, or rescheduling your timeslot or resetting your store location. Can I pay for the delivery using WIC funds? No, delivery fees & other associated charges may not be paid for with WIC benefits. Only eligible items may be purchased with WIC benefits. Am I eligible for Shipping when using my WIC benefits? Yes, WIC eligible items can be shipped to you when using your WIC benefits. What if I don’t have enough funds to cover my order balance? If you don’t have enough available WIC funds to cover your eligible items, you may add another payment type to complete the order. You have the option to split your payment between a WIC card & another form of payment. What is an order adjustment charge? This charge covers any adjustments to your total for weighted items. We’ll refund any amount that’s left over. How do I get free shipping or delivery? Walmart+ members enjoy savings & benefits, such as unlimited scheduled home delivery with no delivery fees & free unscheduled shipping. You do not need a Walmart+ membership to use your WIC benefits. However, home delivery from Walmart requires a $7.95—$9.95 delivery fee which is not covered by WIC benefits. Free shipping is offered for orders over $35. What happens if I do not pick up my order?
If you don’t pick up your order by your selected time, we will hold your order for 24 hours. If you don’t pick up your order within 24 hours, the order will be returned & funds will be refunded back to your WIC card. If it is within your benefit period, you can use the refunded funds on a future purchase. If the 24-hour hold period falls outside of your benefit period, the funds will not be available for you to use on a future purchase. Why can I only select certain pickup or delivery dates & times? Since WIC benefits expire every month, your order must be picked up or delivered before your benefits expire. For shipping, the estimated arrival date must be before your benefits expire.
