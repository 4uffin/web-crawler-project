I'm wandering around the JW Marriott, where the media centre is set up for press interviews.Stars are walking through here with their publicity teams and I've just seen Sam Nivola of the White Lotus walk in, all smiles. There is a security screening area outside the hotel and there are police officers posted at most of the entrances, with K-9 units milling about around LA Live - the downtown LA campus that houses the Peacock Theater, the JW Marriott and Crypto.com arena.The Emmy trophies - golden statuettes of a winged muse holding up an atom - are heavily guarded by security personnel.

Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingWhich shows were actually the most watched?published at 22:58 BST22:58 BST
Awards don't always tell us the full story of which shows are audience favourites. So let's take a look at the series that were actually the most watched within the Emmy eligibility window, according to Nielsen research.A note on this data, it can include previous seasons of these shows. Drama series: The White LotusThe White Lotus was viewed for about 210 million hours between June 2024 and May 2025. It's followed by Severance (157.5m hours) and The Last of Us (137.1m hours). Comedy series: Abbott ElementaryIt looks like everyone showed up to class this year because Abbott Elementary outranked all other comedy series in terms of viewership with 181.4m hours viewed. Other fan favourites were Only Murders in the Building (159.1m hours) and The Bear (141.1m hours).Limited series: Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez StoryAs their legal battle continues in real life, the show about the Menendez brothers' crimes got nearly 150m hours of viewing, outranking The Penguin (102.3m hours).Most watched actors and actressesNielsen also recorded who the most watched actors were in every category. Gary Oldman, was the most watched in any category, with more than 600 million viewing hours. And while his show Slow Horses is a nominee tonight, it's likely his numbers are so huge because of his appearances in the Harry Potter movies.Kathy Bates was the most watched drama actress.

Image source, HBOMy colleagues have been telling you what they loved most about the five most nominated TV shows at the Emmys. The final show on that list is The Penguin. And I have some thoughts.When you make a TV show about one of the most infamous comic
supervillains of all time, youâd expect them to battle a superhero.But thereâs no Batman in sight in HBOâs The Penguin.And itâs better for it. Instead of a good vs evil plot, you get a truly unrecognisable
Colin Farrell playing a Gotham gangster trying to rise up through the
underworld. Farrellâs performance is helped by a mass of prosthetics, a
pronounced limp, and a harsh New York accent.But itâs Cristin Miliotiâs role as a mobsterâs daughter that steals the show as she seeks revenge against seemingly everyone she has ever known.Another standout is the gritty cinematography. Shot on
locations across the real New York City, it creates a claustrophobic atmosphere of alleys
and buildings no normal person would want any part of.The Penguin is no Tony Soprano, but he kept me intrigued to
see what his next move in the deadly game of chess would be.

Image source, Apple TV+Warning, there's some spoilers aheadThe amazing locations, Seth Rogen's wardrobe, and a group of comedic talents delivering laugh after laugh. These are my top reasons for loving The Studio and, I must admit, my affections follow that order.
I had never cared about men's clothing before this show and I'd also never rooted for a contemporary costume nomination (didn't know that category existed until I elatedly saw The Studio got a nod). No, The Studio's Emmy-nominated writing didn't make my list. Honestly, that's the weakest point for this workplace comedy about a bunch of moviemakers, where the plot turns, punchlines, problems our hapless crew creates, and clumsy resolutions to those problems are all obvious from miles away, or even just from the episode titles.What the performers, though, do with the writing kept me rushing to wince-watch episodes on the same days Apple dropped them. Each member of the core ensemble shines alone. All crowded in together with a heady array of guest stars (almost all of whom have nominations), they push this show to the level of the best episodes of Parks and Rec, The Thick of It and, during the big splashy scenes at the end of the season, 30 Rock. The fluid single camera moving among the herd of characters made me feel like I was in on the action, and in on the jokes, which often turned the cringiest moments into ones of squealing delight. At the least, it made me regularly talk to the screen, nearly shouting at Kathryn Hahn's hilarious trendy buffoon, Maya, "Just ask Ice Cube!" as she discussed casting and then whispering to Rogen's overeager man-child, Matt, "Don't you do it" as he nervously looked around the table at an auction at The Ebell.Ah, The Ebell of Los Angeles, the Spanish-style clubhouse that brings me to what I truly love most about this show - the Hollywood locales. Since I left LA (I actually spent a lot of my childhood on the lot of an old Hollywood studio), I often find myself longing for its Deco and Modernist buildings and desert-meets-the-sea landscaping. Watch just one episode of this stylish romp, and you'll feel the same, oh yeah.

Image source, HBOEditor's note: We've been bringing you some thoughts about the most nominated shows at the 2025 Emmys, and up next is my colleague Blanca's take on the HBO smash hit The Last of Us.Warning, there's some spoilers aheadAfter playing The Last of Us, I had my doubts about whether HBO could do justice to such a beloved video game - but the show surpassed all my expectations. HBO has masterfully capture the heart of the story with powerful performances, thoughtful pacing and writing, and stunning visuals.
Watching these characters come to life has made my inner fan girl lose it with excitement. Even those who haven't played the video game can appreciate the richness of the series. Also, two words: Pedro Pascal. His portrayal of Joel Miller carried both season one and two. Despite his character's demise early in season two, his performance is unforgettable. For me, he wasn't just playing Joel, he was Joel. He delivered a version of the character that was more broken and deeply protective than ever before, which I loved.
Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingWhite Lotus season three was an eight-episode panic attackpublished at 22:17 BST22:17 BSTSakshi VenkatramanUS reporter
Image source, Fabio Lovino/ HBOImage caption, Aimee Lou Wood and Patrick Schwarzenegger in White Lotus season threeWarning, there's some spoilers ahead.Set against the backdrop of a beautiful resort in Thailand, this season of White Lotus was less about action and more about gradual mental undoing's. There were no rich ladies falling to their death from a yacht or brutal stabbings, but watching Jason Isaacsâ character have a several-episode mental breakdown had me stressed.This emotional rollercoaster of a season was rife with the whispered trash talk and subtle jabs of a girls trip, the self-hatred of a shady man with major daddy issues, and a set of entitled, borderline-incestuous siblings.The writing was understated and full of red herrings, and the entire internet was convinced the final killer was a monkey with a gun. There were so many standout performances, especially by Isaacs, Walton Goggins and Aimee Lou Wood (who played the worldâs most patient girlfriend). So it makes sense that the show is up for multiple acting and writing awards tonight.
The cast has virtually taken over the outstanding supporting actress in a drama series category, with Carrie Coon, Parker Posey, Natasha Rothwell and Aimee Lou Wood all facing off. Isaacs and Goggins are also going head to head in the supporting actor category. My White Lotus honourable mention is Lisa from Blackpink, who, though not nominated for an award, made the season extra exciting. I hope she makes an appearance tonight.

Image source, Apple TV+Warning, there's some spoilers ahead.Severance often gets compared to The Officeâs satire of aughts corporate life, though one is a thriller and the other a comedy. Iâd argue Apple TV+âs hit actually has more in common with the work of David Lynch â and thatâs a major selling point for me. Itâs a rare, worthy successor to the auteurâs films that deserves our attention for its unsparing look at the modern workplace.Lynchâs work often mingled the mundane with the sinister, with an occasional hint of whimsy (melon party, anyone?). His work often features dual personalities and average people corrupted by forces that lurk out of view â dark technologies, personal tragedy and mysterious cults, perhaps.Severance and Lynchâs oeuvre also share Patricia Arquette. She plays Harmony Cobel, the emotionally-repressed and ambitious program leader of the severed floor in the Apple series, and also starred in Lynchâs surrealist thriller Lost Highway (1997) as an emotionally-repressed and ambitious femme fatale.This season of Severance wasnât perfect - Cobelâs revelatory visit home was a slow weak spot. But the season greatly expanded the world of Lumon Industries, and when it hit its marks, it was transcendently weird, such as the reveal of Gemmaâs doll-like existence as a research patient. Tramell Tillmanâs Seth Milchik was also given an expanded and complex role this season worthy of an Emmy. We see how his job, his status in the company and his race divide him in different ways. Markâs (Adam Scott) conversation with his severed self via an old-school camcorder (a very Lynchian device!) was also an inspired and inventive highlight for me. In a world full of slick streaming productions and corporate branding, a little weirdness can wake us up. Even if it doesnât win the major awards this year, Severance has your attention.
