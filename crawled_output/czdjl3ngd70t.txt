In his most viral sketch, he played George Washington making fun of the American system of measurements.In 2021, the Atlantic dubbed him the ânicest man in standupâ for his âslow, inoffensive, even soothingâ humor.

I'm wandering around the JW Marriott, where the media centre is set up for press interviews.Stars are walking through here with their publicity teams and I've just seen Sam Nivola of the White Lotus walk in, all smiles. There is a security screening area outside the hotel and there are police officers posted at most of the entrances, with K-9 units milling about around LA Live - the downtown LA campus that houses the Peacock Theater, the JW Marriott and Crypto.com arena.The Emmy trophies - golden statuettes of a winged muse holding up an atom - are heavily guarded by security personnel.
