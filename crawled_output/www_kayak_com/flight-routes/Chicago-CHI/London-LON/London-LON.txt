So that was really nice.We had a layover from YVR to Denver. We bought 4 bottles of Absolut Vodka at the YVR Duty Free for $116.20, after going through security and American Customs Pre Clearance at YVR, Vancouver. When we landed in Denver, United put us behind the American Customs as well as TSA again for some reason. We were forced to go through American Customs and TSA again. TSA confiscated our rightfully owned Duty Free Absolut Vodka bottles. Because United incorrectly forced our flight behind American border and TSA again, we missed the connecting flight. After United put us on a later flight, we eventually arrived in Chicago very late, with hardly any sleep. I am looking for compensation from United for our incorrectly confiscated Absolut Vodka bottles worth $116.20, as well as compensation for incorrectly putting us behind American Customs and TSA again, causing us to miss our connecting flight, making us arrive extremely late in Chicago.Excellent flight. Boarding was efficient and departure was on time. Smooth flight with on time arrival. Deplaning was also efficient.It was delayed instead of departing at 9:20pm, we departed at 11pm… putting us in Columbus after 2am! It was awful. Had I known about the delay, I could have spent some time in the United Lounge… I was starving because I started my journey in Budapest… so I was exhausted and hungry. Plus I had to make new arrangements to be picked up at the airport in Columbus, instead of midnight it was 2:30 am after getting luggage and out of airport. Not feasible. I would have just stayed in Chicago for the night and gotten a morning flight.It was great, I’m very grateful for the pilots and crew flight attendants for everything.Although the flight was delayed the crew and the flight itself were very good. Couldn't fault anything and after the disappointment of being abandoned in the US by BA it was a welcome relief to travel with UnitedEvidently, my seat had the only broken TV. I couldn’t plug it in, get it to come on, or watch anything, and of course, no one could fix it while we were on the plane. The service was good and the boarding was quickThe boarding of took of late.The presentation of the food was horrable as was the tast of the food was cold and tastless.Delay and keep changing gates. I have to run around from B to C then to E.I was charged for my daughters bag when I am supposed to receive two free checked bags with my United Explorer card.Lost luggage stuck no clothes and no word after 2 days leaving on cruise no stuff or clothesDon’t know they cancelled the flight day before I was to leave. They sent a email at 9:00 pm at night saying they cancelled. That is the smooth way to say we don’t want your business! I think they didn’t have enough people booking so they cancelled the flight! It’s all about the money anymore there is no honesty in business.The flight was canceled 3 hours after original take off timePathetic check in experience at JFK. Everything is self check in. Not enough staff present to help with when the check in process or the kiosk gets stuck. Staff present not welcoming or pleasant at all. On the other hand the NY based flight crew was great. Courteous and friendly throughout the flight. Special meals leave a lot to be desired. Kids meals should be made available when kids are flying and same goes for special kids meals too.Flight was full, and would have preferred an aisle seat, but due to getting a late ticket ,the seat I had was adequate. The flight crew were very help full and hard working. Food and drink were excellent for the 11hr flight. Overall I was pleased with flight, and would recommend British Airways again.More choices on menu. Seemed only thing offered was Scottish, and while that’s good for the Scot’s it doesn’t help the Americans who don’t like that food. And I really hate it when, during sleep time the attendants have a very loud conversation right over you. Lastly, I paid 5000 dollars for business class, and having to pay more to choose my seat early is really an insult. Seems greedyThe chicken adobo was a little too spicy but good otherwise. My personal opinion. Movie selection could be improved, too many horror movies. Could add a few more chick flicks! The flight was bumpy at times. We arrived a little early too! Flight attendants friendly.Again flight was awesome except British Airways lost both gate checked luggage’s. Still missingreally bad they refused to check in luggages that I had purchased, even showing them the transaction receipt from british airways app the staff in miami was MEDIOCRECrew was great and responsive. Entertainment quit working with about 4 hours remaining on the flight. My seat cushion was broken.Handling our luggage was the biggest issue - they lost it and we got it almost 3 days later. Really threw off the beginning of our trip and we really had to change our itinerary accordingly.Seat was hard and uncomfortable and the temperature too warm and uncomfortable.No meals included on this long international flight. Most airlines will offer you a meal when flying internationally. Not Icelandair. Your included choices are water and coffee. Poor customer service. The airport was also very confusing.I flew Icelandair with my partner from Prague to the US. Overall flight time was around 12 hours, with a connecting flight in Iceland. I have flown internationally for years and with multiple airlines. Every airline serves you a meal when traveling internationally. Icelandair not only did not offer an inclusive meal, but they did not even offer a snack. The only things they served over our long flight was water and coffee. Ridiculous! Never again will I fly with Icelandair.Best smelling onboard bathrooms ever. Even after use the whole flight. Biggest overhead bins. Most legroom in economy class. Great Icelandiic music. Really nice staff. Icelandair is awesome! (Don’t fly Air Canada! During the strike they lied about no flights available (I booked this flight myself) and hid the process to get money back on their website by obscuring menu titles, then made it difficult and time consuming to fill out. I’m Canadian. Don’t trust Air Canada!It was good. The air plane is clean and staff were friendly.Worst airline I’ve ever flown. Delayed 5.5 hrs, missed connecting flight, and missed an entire day of vacation. Zero customer serviceEverything sucked. No food, one small glass of water, a tiny coffee, 5.5 hour delay with no customer service. Would never recommend flying them.The crew was wonderful at check in, the gate and on board. Felt the luggage had more room than the passengers. The seats were smaller than most domestic U.S. airlines. I'm only 5'2" and I had little legroom. There were only 2 bathrooms in coach. Needed more. The flight was very smooth but not the most comfortable.There was no lounge at Boston for us to use. Typically flying first class overseas comes with lounge privileges. The seats did not recline even a little. My headset only worked on one side. I felt like I was flying on Ryan Air, not Icelandic Air.It was fortunate that the flight arrived in London in accordance with schedule, and the luggage was promptly transferred to the luggage carousel. However, I find it concerning that even minor issues in economy cabins are prevalent within the industry. American Airlines, in particular, appears to have the least legroom and feels more crowded due to the proximity of neighboring passengers. Additionally, the crew’s adherence to protocol is inconsistent. While they may enforce certain rules set by the FAA on a select few individuals, they often overlook numerous violations, such as failing to reset seat recline during landing.Easy and organized getting in and out of the flightWe liked the flight but while we purchased an aisle seat, our seats had a different configuration on this flight. A fellow passenger suggested that the airplane had been changed. Too bad we were not informed and had no chance to modify our seat preferences. We were stuck in the window and middle seats with no chance to walk around and go to the bathroom without disturbing our sleeping fellow passenger.The crew were not very personable. The crew did not serve tea or coffee. The bathroom was not kept clean. Two out of the 5 toilets in the cabin weren't working.It was extremely cold in the back of the plane. The seats are uncomfortable and space very small. Crew was excellent as usual.Check in needed to be in person, not nice. Also I won’t do connections in Charlotte again because you need to go through security again and short connections become a problemIberia lost my bag, said they found it in another country, said they sent it to me, but never did. Went my whole trip without my stuff, but expecting it to show up because that’s what they said would happen. Their communication sucks, their website sucks, and to top it all off, their seats are small and uncomfortable. They’re bad at their jobs and they should feel bad about themselves. Do not even get me started on the flight home. AVOID!I described my experience in the previous window. I didn't realize that there would be another opportunity for this flight. Please look at my response in the previous window.Boarding was 2 1/2 late no explanation Captain said he did not know why, but he rested at home for an extra couple of hours. Food was edible, Nothing more.I liked the comfort of the plane. It was unexpected from past experiences.The seating has become ridiculous… like a contest to see how narrow and short they can be made- forcing anyone over 5’1 to pay more to not be twisting oneself into a pretzel. Really insane- would have thought BA was better than this. Frankly- it cancels out a lot of the positive aspects.flight was delayed from BWI to London - missed my connecting flight & then connecting flight (also British Air) was delayed - food is awful, TV & movie selection is greatSuper tight economy class. My knees were hitting the back of seat in front of me (I'm only 5'6"). My small backpack (sized according to their required dimensions) would not fit under the seat in front of me because there is a box (is that the life jacket?) in the way. Over all, extremely uncomfortable. I forgive the tasteless food, but the tight seating was tortureDidn’t fly with them as someone had cancelled my flightOnline check-in 24 hours in advance something seems not so easy to check in to pick seats and to print a boarding passI like the crew, very welcoming. Food can be better. The seat arms don’t go up so. I could use the empty seat next to mine to relax better. 3hrs delay 😠Boarding was efficient and quick, crew was very attentive, seats were comfortable.Everything was very good! I personally struggled with the heat in the cabin for the first 2 hoursVery caring crew on board. Didn’t have dinner as I was sleeping. Was seating in the emergency row so I had comfortable leg roomHad a nice little suite although I couldn’t close the door (but I didn’t ask anyone to help). 5K is a nice seat and very private (you look in on first class). Enjoyable flight and nice crew.United Airlines7.4American Airlines7.2Icelandair7.0Iberia7.0British Airways6.7Everything you need to know for your flight from Chicago to LondonAirlinesCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsOther airlines flying from Chicago to LondonFlights from the other most popular airlines that fly from Chicago to London according to KAYAK users.
