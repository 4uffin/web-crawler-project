Internet and power not working until into flight. Internet would stop working during flight.My flight was delayed 50 minutes and we were rushed to board to then sit for 15 minutes until the pilot arrived. Unacceptable since we could have waited to board. Also the delayed flight was updated AFTER we boarded to more than the 10 minutes as originally stated.If we are going to have to pay for luggage, make it easier to do. Put something on the app during check-in so I don't need to do it at the kiosk. I've done it twice recently and I ended up having to pay at the desk because something went wrong at the kiosk in Tampa.Everything was on time. I was disappointed by the front section female, African American flight attendant. I did not see her name tag or would have identified by name not race. As passengers moved to the bathroom early in flight, she would say with a disdainful tone “I have to say the seat belt light is on” then go back to her book. Better trained flight attendants say something like be careful the seat belt light is on.The price of the tickets isn't matching the flight experience. No matter how long the flight is, you're only getting pretzels. The flight attendants looked unkept and over it.WiFi on the flight was not working. Thus, entertainment options were limited.Flight was awfully bumpy and landing was a bit jolting. I was in the restroom when snacks and drinks were served and was not asked if i wanted any. I had to ask for water finally.Multiple delays and gate changes. Arrived at final destination 6 hours late. All rental cars had been taken.Crew was great flight was great baggage claim was a failure. It took over 1 hour for bags to arrive. Poor communication poor effort when I spoke to the supervisor about the delayThe movies using Southwest WiFi kept pausing and I had to restart multiple times.We will be writing a long, detailed letter to corporate about our awful experience with American airlines.Food was ok, but not as good as I have had before on AA.Pretty good. The food was just mediocre, the boarding and crew were good.It was very difficult to stretch my knee out and I am very short. I also had a torn tendon in my knee which made it extra uncomfortable anyways. My husband is 6'2" and I can't imagine him flying in that plane.It was one of my worst flight ever. First they were changing the gate for at least 4 times, changing from gate D7 to D12 to D44. Considering the size of the Miami Airport, we are talking about long distance and the train at the airport was not working. Then the flight was delayed around one hour. Then finally we boarded into the plane and when everybody was seated, there was an announcement that there is an issue with one of the tire of the plane, so we all had to get out of the plane with our belongings, to replace the tire. So we had around 2.5-hour delayThe delays and cancellations kept me stuck in Miami for an additional 24 hours, and the whole thing seemed extremely disorganizedThe flight to Tokyo AA61 took off about two hours late, but then had to turn back. By that time the crew had to be replaced. Then they kept promising to take off in an hour, then in 3, then switch to the next day.Flight was late and missed connecting flight. They could have better accommodated, but instead did an overnight and had to arrive the next afternoon.The flight was delayed leaving Miami. When we arrived in Charlotte, we were unable to park at our scheduled gate. We had to wait another 30-45 minutes before we could park at a different gate. All in all, we were delayed by almost two hours arriving in Charlotte.the pilot that landed this flight in Philadelphia did an amazing job, the weather was absolutely terrible and we landed safely.The flight was delayed twice with minimal explanation. The terminal and airplane were filthy. The food voucher didn’t even cover a tiny pizza from a kiosk in the terminal. All in all, a pretty miserable experience for a flight to attend a funeralFor the minimalist experience, it is really a great ride-- feels a little like public transport i guessThe flight was delayed four and half hours for paperwork on a maintenance issue. Very frustrating.Flight delayed over 3 or 4 hours because no captain to fly plane. I couldn’t make a connection and had to wait 9 hours for another flight. Had to fly red eye flight. SucksFirst off, i received an e-mail to allow me to check in for our flight. I folllowed the link, when it came to the seat selection, I was unable to select any "free" seats ( meaning without any additional charge) because everything was " unavailable". My Husband and I were ttavelling with our 3 children hence, i wanted to be assured that we were all seated next to each other. I tried 3 times and everytime I click the selection it said " error loading". What the system wants is for me to buy the seats ( anywhere from $25 to $50 dollars each passenger) like I did on our flight bound to L.A. I called customer service and the guy was unhelpful all he kept repeating was to come really early at the airport and we will be assigned seats there. Imagine my anxiety!!! Spirit says they are a budget airline but they are actually the opposite!! And just before our flight, the flight attendant KEPT announcing/ selling the seats that were not purchased for a cheaper price!! Like it was a bidding/ bargaining game! This was our first and last time to fly Spirit.My flight got cancelled by Spirit airlines, it was bad experience to meSpirit gets you there; it's no worse than any other aircraft, all things considered. (It's not like everyone else is such a hero). But - holy moses - do they nickel and dime you to absolutely every nickel - I was really expecting to have to pay to use the bathroom. And when the captain comes on with a 5 minute sales pitch about getting "points", that was like something on Bizarro world. Other than that, everyone else was professional and worked hard to get us from point A to point B. I'm not loving all the "self-service" stuff but there it is - just when the machines don't work you don't have anyone to talk to.Easy boarding and good flight. Need to work on the beverage and snack situationThe staff was great, but because the 2nd lieutenant didn’t show up for the flight we all had to deboard and wait 2 1/2 hours for one to show up. Very disappointing the crew can’t get schedules confirmed which wouldn’t have caused this issue.The seats! Do not nickel and dime! Be transparent about all your fees!The experience was good. No frills but I got there safe and sound and on time.After boarding and un-boarding twice over 6+hours, the flight was canceled.Severe turbulence. Captain never came on to reassure passengers after things settled down.Boarding in Orlando was not good. Giant mob at the gate, should have been lines.baggage clamed had to wait over a hour and half for all people on my flight it was terribleMy flight was canceled I was promised a reginf still not received.My flight was delayed by two hours which made it so that I would miss my layover flight. I stood in line for customer service for over an hour and when I reached the agent she told me to scan a QR code and it'll give me options. I wasn't offered any help, guidance or compensation, only told that I have options but that I had to figure it all out myself. I was refunded part of the trip and had to buy an expensive same day ticket from another airline in order to get home. I will never fly Frontier again.The confirmation # CK8GNW and my name was not recognized/in Frontier system. I was able to check in on Frintier app so i went to the Frontier ticket agent, at time they told me that my name/ confirmation did not show up as a purchased ticket. I had to purchase a new ticket that cost $289.00 one way.Although an hour and a half early was told by staff at check in they had overbooked and could not check us in for the flight.The crew was delayed because they came on another flight that was delayed due to weather 10pm flight left at 1.30 am The airline made no effort to align alternate crewSouthwest8.0American Airlines7.2Spirit Airlines6.3Frontier5.8Everything you need to know for your flight from Miami to DallasAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsInformation on your arrival and departure airportsMiami (MIA)Cabin class types available on flights from Miami to DallasCabin classes available on flights from Miami to Dallas.
