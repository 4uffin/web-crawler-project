The one flight was not equipped with WIFI which now adays seems odd. All in all the experience was goodPassengers need to check in big baggage instead of bringing on the plane. That cause inconvenience for everyone. Otherwise flight was good.Perfect flight both ways. On time, courteous staff, plane comfortable and cool. Best domestic flights I’ve had in awhile.The food was terrible especially for a 15 hour international flight. The crew was unpleasant as well.Really low quality food especially for an international flight. The crew also was surprisingly unpleasant except couple of ladies. I know we were not in first class but that’s no reason to treat customers as less.Flight delayed for two and half hours and then canceled altogether due to mechanical issues. No mechanic onsite to fix so had to send one from LAX.Quick check in. Everything went smooth. I don't know what can be done about airline food.Crew was good. The reservation got mixed up and they didn't have my TSA number. I am also a Silver Medallion and wasn't able to use Sky Priority.Delta made it easy, comfortable and timely. The crew was fantastic.This route with Delta always has delays or is cancelled. Aircrafts seem smaller and older. I fly Delta quite a bit - haven’t had issues with the international flights. But this route has always been the troublesome oneTerrible. They wouldn't allow me on my flight on the 14th..We had to deboard 2 times due to maintenance issues. They changed the plane, and then we got deviated to LAX due to maibtenance issues on the other plane, had to sleep at LAX and los a full day.Everything was good, except the seats in economy were so close together, you could barely get out when the seat in front of your was reclined. If the airlines keep jamming in more and more seats, it will become intolerable. I will look for another airline that considers customer comfort and does not keep adding more rows of seats for more profit.The newer screen was super cool and had the option to watch many different shows or movies. Crew was polite and helpful. However again, many children screaming bloody murder and kicking my seat, and parents doing nothing about it as usual.Flight was good and crew was super polite. However, there were around 5 kids screaming the WHOLE 2 hours. I understand kids have to come but parents need to do something to control their children. They make the experience terrible, especially after finishing 16 hour shifts at the hospital I needed some sleep, which I did not get.IAD with the archaic people movers is just a place to be avoided.Great service on board. Boarding a bit slow due to process. Food was pretty average.Tastless food and too obvious lack of enthusiasm for service in the economy vesus business classAll of the United employees I interacted with were professional and courteous. The aircraft was clean, the food on the flight was good. No complaints here.I had no checked baggage but was required to hand over carry on baggage at the door of the plane. There was a lot of overboard space in the plane and I was one of the last ones. I ran to get my carry on but it was gone. I was given back at the plane door in Toronto, so the wait was not as long as it would have been at the carousel.Given it’s a red-eye into Charolotte, we didn’t get any food. The survey does not include “N/A” so the rating will be skewed.Great. Quick and quiet and east. The breakfast choices were a welcome surprise!American airlines suck they delay the flights all the time made me sleep in an airport because my flight was delayed and I miss my connecting flightThere's nothing I liked about it. For first off I scheduled this trip two weeks in advance then they delayed my flight which messed up my whole trip. So I scheduled it for the following weekend thinking there won't be a delay and guess what as soon as I got to the airport we said in the airplane on the tarmac for an hour and a half. Not only was it delayed I missed my connecting flight meaning I had to stay the night at Dallas-Fort Worth airport sleeping on the floor. I will tell you this I will never fly American airlines ever again I have had nothing but horrible experience with them and I just throw money at themThe stewardess hit me with the food kart twice on the head and didn't say I'm sorry once. The same stewardess gave me a warm Apple Juice with No ice. The Flight was delayed for Departure 6 times, starting from 2:36pm, finally taking off 7:50pm. I was late picking up my child from the sitter by 3 hours.Don’t know they cancelled the flight day before I was to leave. They sent a email at 9:00 pm at night saying they cancelled. That is the smooth way to say we don’t want your business! I think they didn’t have enough people booking so they cancelled the flight! It’s all about the money anymore there is no honesty in business.Having to reschedule flights a day later, they loaded by luggage on the wrong plane from Little rock now I have to HOPE they deliver it to where im staying like they said would. International flight crew was very disgruntled and not very friendly.We will be writing a long, detailed letter to corporate about our awful experience with American airlines.It took way too long to diagnose and solve the problem of a broken crew member cabin seat. Though compensation for the volunteer who left the flight was very kind.The entertainment package was vast and the selections were very current. Keep updating it was great.Everything was great. I liked the text updates so that I never miss a gate change & I have all the latest info.I don’t usually fly budget airlines or airlines in the United States. It was as good as any other airline. The seats are comfortable and the airline attendants are not rude & surly. Very nice flight (s).No internet on a flight over three hours in this age is criminal. Staff inattentive and dismissiveThey have the most inexperienced / rude flight staff I’ve encounteredvery difficult boarding process - aggressive passengers not the friendliest crewWiFi was not eorkig (again) And the plane was from 1990 with the screens which were.not touch and most didn’t even work and if lucky could tune in tvI paid extra for a seat closer to the front. The TV didn’t work at all for the entire flight. Would have been nice to know before I purchased an “upgraded “ seatIt was great. I had never flown on JetBlue before, but would be very happy to fly with them in the future.Worst flight experience ever flights canceled. JetBlue told us just did not even bother standing in line to come back in one and a half hours then without any information we had to go pick up all of our luggage and spend over $2000 in accommodation just to get home. JetBlue said that the next flight available for us to get home would be three days later. Absolutely absurd hasn’t offered to give us any compensation do not fly JetBlue horrible company. They said it was based on the weather and the weather is great in all locations that we would’ve been flying to total hoax. I think it’s a conspiracy theory.The captain gave good announcements and the flight attendants were friendly. The WiFi was pretty good. The plane itself looked very old inside and the seats were very uncomfortable. The screens in the seat backs were the smallest I’ve ever seen. There were so many loud and obnoxious kids on this flight and the parents didn’t do much to try to quiet them down. Some had videos and games on tablets with higher than necessary volume going the whole time.Seats were new and comfortable. Staff was fine. Missed my connection due to weather -which wasn’t their fault- but got no help at all. Gate staff sent me to customer service, which was and stayed unstaffed. Sign with QR code directed me to call or chat. Chat was useless. Call was returned after an hour. No itinerary offered by Frontier could get me home in less than 30 hours. Rebooked with another airline and got a partial refund that came to about 10 percent of what I paid to get home.Finally a Frontier on time and efficient. I've had problems before with your airline, but this time everything went fine.The experience was good. No frills but I got there safe and sound and on time.Great for the price. No wifi or entertainment, but gate agents and crew were fantastic and we boarded quickly and left on time.sluggish boarding and arrival procedures, fake nice flight attendants, and lots of delays.Disaster. They lied every step of the way. We ended up being delayed due to crew and then allegedly abandoned the flight because of a curfew at LGA. No rebooking to LGA at any reasonable time. No hotel. No meal vouchers. Had to sleep in the airport and fly to Newark instead. Will never fly Frontier again.What I expected, nickeled and dined and a frontier flight attendant loudly complained about her job and lack of communication as she headed to the gate on her cell phone. Not professional.As every law enforcement agency I could imagine surrounded the plane and we didn’t disembark for 2 hours and then had to stick around for another hour to go get our personal belongings after leaving them behind and being bused away from the plane, it was scary and inconvenient. We were given no information as to why this was happening. Lack of communication with passengers was disappointing.After boarding and un-boarding twice over 6+hours, the flight was canceled.Severe turbulence. Captain never came on to reassure passengers after things settled down.Delta7.9United Airlines7.4American Airlines7.2JetBlue7.2Frontier5.8Traveling to a place near Punta Cana?Book flights to Punta Cana if you plan to visit one of these locationsBavaroEverything you need to know for your flight to Punta CanaAirlinesAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsPopular routesReturn flight dealsFlights with popular airlines flying to Punta CanaFlights from the other most popular airlines that fly from the United States to Punta Cana according to KAYAK users.
