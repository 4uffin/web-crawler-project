It took over one hour to pass checkpoint and security gate. We stood under the sun in the long lineTerrible. Would never fly again. Took them several hours to prepare the plane and and reached my destination 4 hours late.Our boarding was delayed due to two flat tires, but I appreciate the focus on safety. I also appreciated the additional offerings for drinks which never happened before except on Hawaiian Airlines. The hospitality is fantastic! Glad I upgraded to premium seats for the extra leg room as I was getting frustrated when the person in front of me was very restless and kept shifting. Otherwise, it was a fantastic experience.Tickets we booked together in January became two different connecting flights. VERY PISSED a about this and a terrible start to our bucket list vacationCould not check in online - had to get boarding passes at the ticket counter and our daughter got bumped off our connecting flight. NOT OK!I needed more space to sleep on an overnight flight.Really bad experience. Bad customer service from the check in process through the entire flight.Wonderful respectful staff for a short flight late at night...lots of considerations all met!Flight was delayed which led to missed connection, but rebooked on a more direct flight at the last minute and arrived in Juneau on time with all our luggage. Little stressful and our family seating got split, but it all worked out in the end.1. On time flights. All of our, three separate, flights for three families were late 2. No food on the 5 1/2 hour flight. A substantial snack would have been good. 3. Seat upgrades are expensive 4. No place to move around or stretch on the 5 1/2 hour flightI wish they had movie screens in the headrests. The seats are much improved, more legroom and recently renovated. Bathroom was clean. Staff was outstanding!!As always, the entire Southwest experience was wonderful, from online booking to flight to baggage retrieval. Very grateful.The weather could have been better. There was a 40 minute ATC delay in SFO because of marine fog and a micro cell storm delayed landing and take-off at Nashville. The gate was changed 5 minutes from boarding from gate B3 to gate C23 at Nashville airport.After being assaulted by a flight attendant I was then brushed off as oh well because he long braids didn’t mean to whip me in the eye. I have filed complaints and will see. But like any other issue I’ve had with kayak involved it’s been trash. Last time I’ll be using your appAC sub par. WiFi not working correctly. Ac sucked. Seats very narrow.Near 4 hour flight with only 1 service. Had to use call button to request water. Internet and power not working until into flight. Internet would stop working during flight.Southwest's seats are the least comfortable I have ever sat in.The cabin was quiet for the redeye flight. The area was clean. The staff was great. The 787 Max was in good condition. Drawbacks were that the seat widths were tight for some passengers. The seat padding was at best average and for a long flight uncomfortable.Southwest like most American domestic airlines, is a mediocre airline. But it is among the cheapest. Oh well.My flight was delayed 50 minutes and we were rushed to board to then sit for 15 minutes until the pilot arrived. Unacceptable since we could have waited to board. Also the delayed flight was updated AFTER we boarded to more than the 10 minutes as originally stated.They we able to seat my companion and I next to each other. Plane’s temperature was very cool. Willl be more prepared on return trip.What an amazing flight. I haven’t experienced this level of service in a flight in years. This will be the only way to fly to Hawaii for me in the future.Hawaiian airlines has awful customer service. Told me to keep a flight I wasn’t boarding, instead of rebooking me under two separate reservations, which caused my whole reservation to be canceled. Major issues with leadership and management. The staff at Hilo was reluctant to give me a refund, so I had to by a first class ticket in order to get on a flight the same time as my partner. The blame was pointed at me without sincere apology until the supervisor came out, who also apparently had no authority to refund me. Still waiting on correspondence from the airline days later.Hawaiian Airlines staff is always professional & quick & easy check in & boarding processThis is my first time flying Hawaiian. It was so disorganized and poorly coordinated, resulting in the most unacceptable delayBoarding was a nightmare. Almost everyone was on group 4 and there was no line people crowded the check in and made things more chaotic than they needed to be.The flight crew made the trip pleasant considering they had to work in conditions similar to a sardine can.Good service because of wheelchair. Tight seats. Some announcements were hard to hear or understand. No directions for working the seat video or meanings of the icons. Coming into the country and changing planes was terrible with long lines and few desks open at the end. I had to go through twice because they found my tiny knife with fingernail scissors and file, when they scanned my checked luggage, and in order to keep it. I had to go through that long line a second time. Going home the luggage was checked all the way throughService was so slow. I didn't get enough food and drink.Going to Kahalui was wonderful. Attendants were awesome. Coming home, I was bumped from the seat I originally booked. Imagine my embarrassment as I stood there knowing I booked my flight a month earlier. All in all, I didn’t allow that spoil a wonderful weekend in Maui with family.Alaska Airlines8.0Southwest8.0Hawaiian Airlines7.8Everything you need to know for your flight from Kahului to HonoluluAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsInformation on your arrival and departure airportsKahului (OGG)Honolulu (HNL)Cabin class types available on flights from Kahului to HonoluluCabin classes available on flights from Kahului to Honolulu.
