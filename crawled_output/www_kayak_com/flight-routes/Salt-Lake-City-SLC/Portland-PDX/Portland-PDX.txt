Lovely flight attendants and comfortable plane. The second leg left a lot to be desired. The flight attendant was rude when I asked for a Diet Coke, the boarding required quite a long walk and the plane was crammed and uncomfortable.Planes were on time. Pilot kept everyone updated. Crew was friendly and helpfulYou no longer give receipts for baggage at the counter. And it is next to impossible to get it on your webpage. Spent 20 min trying and gave up... I need receipt to submit for reimbursement and don't have time to waste on your poor webpage Disappointing .....The flight attendants were unkempt and show no customer service skills. They avoided eye contact. There were no smiles and they were dismissive and snarky.Complete flight rebooked and 6 hours delayed. Zero accountability from the airline or Kayak for the issues and I’m injured which is why I opted to pay more to fly than drive because it’s painful to sit or stand too long. What was supposed to be a 3ish hour travel day turned into a 9 hour excruciatingly painful experience that has left me in worse pain than when I initially started.It was a good flight, short so there was no food or water serviceChecking in very confusing compared to Hawaiian Airlines - much simpler! Front checking in at airport can improve. Hawaiian service always gives the extra mile, with a smile. Alaska can use and spread the Aloha Spirit. Mahalo nui loa Thank you 🤙Plane was delayed getting boarded and then again delayed in take-off order. Alaska Airlines must have very little clout at JFK so they don't get priority treatment. All the delays meant we missed the last flight from Portland to Eugene. Alaska did give us hotel voucher for the night...but sent us to a downtown Portland hotel rather than to a nearby airport motel which made for a longer ride at night and then again in the morning. Just made an already long, late night even longer. Hotel was an old outdated Hilton in a slightly seedy part of town. Alaska gave us Lyft vouchers for getting to the hotel, but the return voucher for getting back to the airport in the morning didn't work.Not a fan of a 5 hour delay. I received a text from Alaska Airlines advising I would get a $100 travel voucher via email. Several days later I still haven’t received it.My email notifications were silenced, so I didn't get word that the departing flight had changed gates. It wasn't until I noticed that few people had gathered for the flight that I checked the airport schedule board, 20 minutes before boarding. I then told several people at the old gate of the change. If I was to receive a text I would have been notified of the change earlier, Or to hear an announcement over the airport intercom.The staff and the boarding procedure were all amazing . The one flight was not equipped with WIFI which now adays seems odd. All in all the experience was goodPerfect flight both ways. On time, courteous staff, plane comfortable and cool. Best domestic flights I’ve had in awhile.Really low quality food especially for an international flight. The crew also was surprisingly unpleasant except couple of ladies. I know we were not in first class but that’s no reason to treat customers as less.Flight delayed for two and half hours and then canceled altogether due to mechanical issues. No mechanic onsite to fix so had to send one from LAX.Crew was good. The reservation got mixed up and they didn't have my TSA number. I am also a Silver Medallion and wasn't able to use Sky Priority.Delta made it easy, comfortable and timely. The crew was fantastic.This route with Delta always has delays or is cancelled. Aircrafts seem smaller and older. I fly Delta quite a bit - haven’t had issues with the international flights. But this route has always been the troublesome oneNothing special. The crew never went out of their way for anything.Three seats in first class were broken and while they were able to still acommodate us it was looking very touch and go and they had others they could not acommodateMechanic delay in addition to a 2 hour change in takeoff time was frustrating.First class ticket. They ran out of food and I sat hungry watching the others eatThey we able to seat my companion and I next to each other. Plane’s temperature was very cool. Willl be more prepared on return trip.All was good and they were able to seat my travel companion next to me. Thank you.Like the ample leg room. May as well not bother with snacks if it's only a two ounce bag of pretzels. Didn't use the entertainment option. Was there one?What an amazing flight. I haven’t experienced this level of service in a flight in years. This will be the only way to fly to Hawaii for me in the future.Kayak sold me a ticket after check in time. Could not check in. Could not get on flight.Love you guys are so friendly and kind and wonderfulAgents talk too fast over intercom. I know it’s memorized and we’ve all heard it before. Just slow down a little. Stop charging for checked bags. I was pleased to get my bags promptly at each end of my flight.Everything was great except having to check in at Alaska. That was a surprise and took extra time and effort. Should have been explained somewhere maybe on the HA electronic ticket.It was clean and the crew was great. I wish the chairs could recline just a little more and you would provide small pillows for people with bad backs. My back is fused and a little support would be great.Spirit rescheduled a 4:30 PM flight to 8:52 AM. That's ridiculous and borderline fraud.Everything was fine. I'm average height and I pack light. I'm ready for my Spirit flight.Changing the flight time to 6:15 am on the return flight is extremely inconvenient. The flight was okay. It was on time. The crew was friendly. The seats were uncomfortable. All the upsells are annoying, and I would prefer paying a single higher fee and not have to purchase so much extra.Spirit Airlines was ok but TRAVELHELPDESK, the 3rd party travel agent IS A JOKE! VERY RUDE CUSTOMER AGENTS ont he phone. NO HELP AT ALL. But the airlines was ok.Cancelled my flight last minute and did not help me rebook. It was a horrible experience.No frills - because you get what you pay for. The crew was amazing!! I had plenty of room to spread out because the flight was half full. Which made it easy to sleep.The terminal crew is so rude cabin crew is extremely rude flight is very goodSpirit is low fare air line. Food also cost you. No free food.The flight was delayed twice with minimal explanation. The terminal and airplane were filthy. The food voucher didn’t even cover a tiny pizza from a kiosk in the terminal. All in all, a pretty miserable experience for a flight to attend a funeralI will use spirit more New clean aircraft Excellent crew ! Quick boarding process !Seats were new and comfortable. Staff was fine. Missed my connection due to weather -which wasn’t their fault- but got no help at all. Gate staff sent me to customer service, which was and stayed unstaffed. Sign with QR code directed me to call or chat. Chat was useless. Call was returned after an hour. No itinerary offered by Frontier could get me home in less than 30 hours. Rebooked with another airline and got a partial refund that came to about 10 percent of what I paid to get home.Finally a Frontier on time and efficient. I've had problems before with your airline, but this time everything went fine.The experience was good. No frills but I got there safe and sound and on time.Great for the price. No wifi or entertainment, but gate agents and crew were fantastic and we boarded quickly and left on time.sluggish boarding and arrival procedures, fake nice flight attendants, and lots of delays.Disaster. They lied every step of the way. We ended up being delayed due to crew and then allegedly abandoned the flight because of a curfew at LGA. No rebooking to LGA at any reasonable time. No hotel. No meal vouchers. Had to sleep in the airport and fly to Newark instead. Will never fly Frontier again.What I expected, nickeled and dined and a frontier flight attendant loudly complained about her job and lack of communication as she headed to the gate on her cell phone. Not professional.As every law enforcement agency I could imagine surrounded the plane and we didn’t disembark for 2 hours and then had to stick around for another hour to go get our personal belongings after leaving them behind and being bused away from the plane, it was scary and inconvenient. We were given no information as to why this was happening. Lack of communication with passengers was disappointing.After boarding and un-boarding twice over 6+hours, the flight was canceled.Severe turbulence. Captain never came on to reassure passengers after things settled down.Alaska Airlines8.0Delta7.9Hawaiian Airlines7.8Spirit Airlines6.3Frontier5.8Everything you need to know for your flight from Salt Lake City to PortlandAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsInformation on your arrival and departure airportsSalt Lake City (SLC)Portland (PDX)Cabin class types available on flights from Salt Lake City to PortlandCabin classes available on flights from Salt Lake City to Portland.
