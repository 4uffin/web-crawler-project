That cause inconvenience for everyone. Otherwise flight was good.Perfect flight both ways. On time, courteous staff, plane comfortable and cool. Best domestic flights I’ve had in awhile.The food was terrible especially for a 15 hour international flight. The crew was unpleasant as well.Really low quality food especially for an international flight. The crew also was surprisingly unpleasant except couple of ladies. I know we were not in first class but that’s no reason to treat customers as less.Flight delayed for two and half hours and then canceled altogether due to mechanical issues. No mechanic onsite to fix so had to send one from LAX.Quick check in. Everything went smooth. I don't know what can be done about airline food.Crew was good. The reservation got mixed up and they didn't have my TSA number. I am also a Silver Medallion and wasn't able to use Sky Priority.Knowing what gate to go to was such a issue I couldn’t tell on the app, they tell you what zone you are in but won’t give you the gate number, i almost missed my flight in Atlanta Georgia because of that, as soon as we landed my next flight was already boarding because our flight to Nashville arrived late, I don’t know how that works, but as soon as we got out I was told my next flight is boarding I had to rush lost few of my items, and when I finally got to the gate after struggling, I received a message about my gate after I already boarded, and no my tickets didn’t have the gate numbers either.Delta made it easy, comfortable and timely. The crew was fantastic.This route with Delta always has delays or is cancelled. Aircrafts seem smaller and older. I fly Delta quite a bit - haven’t had issues with the international flights. But this route has always been the troublesome oneI don't understand the concept of paying to get your personal luggage onboard and then asked to check it in.... either sell the space or don't, its a hassle to carry those all through the airport just to make a check in at the last minute.The food was great and the service and attitude was amazing!!It was a great experience. The only thing I would have changed was that the bathrooms were never cleaned and they got very dirty.It was an OK flight with below mediocre service by their flight attendantsWasted a lot of time trying to find the CDG lounge - it was not next to the connecting flight gate like the Air France staff said.My experience was good overall, the quality of the food really decreased! There used to be a choice between meat and fish now it’s between chicken and pasta! In the choices of entertainment meditation has been added which is very good. Soft chair workout to improve blood circulation and avoid phlebitis should be added.The only reason the overall rating wasn't "excellent" was due to problems in claiming luggage. The bags are delivered to the main area (Cinta 35) for domestic passengers, but to a DIFFERENT ROOM for international arrivees. After waiting 30 minutes, someone (who didn't appear to be from Air France or the airport) told us to go to another area. There we found our bags, which appeared to have been awaiting us for a while. We had to go through a bag check before leaving the airport. If we had been alerted to this possibility, or better yet, been to go directly to Cinta 34, we could have eliminated quite a bit of waiting.Much better than the major US Carriers especially in Biz Class.I wish that the meal included a vegetable or even a salad instead of couscous! Why serve chicken with rice AND couscous? Service was good overall though a bit lacking in friendliness. Usually on air france I've been offered a glass of champagne before dinner, wine with dinner, and a digestif after dinner. We were only offered wine this time!It was not Air France but Air Europa. But confusion over our checked luggage. Whether it was checked all the way to Tenerife or not. It was not. Had to line up again in Departures. At least our Sky Priority was honoured. Flight was fine.Handling our luggage was the biggest issue - they lost it and we got it almost 3 days later. Really threw off the beginning of our trip and we really had to change our itinerary accordingly.Seat was hard and uncomfortable and the temperature too warm and uncomfortable.I flew Icelandair with my partner from Prague to the US. Overall flight time was around 12 hours, with a connecting flight in Iceland. I have flown internationally for years and with multiple airlines. Every airline serves you a meal when traveling internationally. Icelandair not only did not offer an inclusive meal, but they did not even offer a snack. The only things they served over our long flight was water and coffee. Ridiculous! Never again will I fly with Icelandair.Best smelling onboard bathrooms ever. Even after use the whole flight. Biggest overhead bins. Most legroom in economy class. Great Icelandiic music. Really nice staff. Icelandair is awesome! (Don’t fly Air Canada! During the strike they lied about no flights available (I booked this flight myself) and hid the process to get money back on their website by obscuring menu titles, then made it difficult and time consuming to fill out. I’m Canadian. Don’t trust Air Canada!It was good. The air plane is clean and staff were friendly.Worst airline I’ve ever flown. Delayed 5.5 hrs, missed connecting flight, and missed an entire day of vacation. Zero customer serviceEverything sucked. No food, one small glass of water, a tiny coffee, 5.5 hour delay with no customer service. Would never recommend flying them.The crew was wonderful at check in, the gate and on board. Felt the luggage had more room than the passengers. The seats were smaller than most domestic U.S. airlines. I'm only 5'2" and I had little legroom. There were only 2 bathrooms in coach. Needed more. The flight was very smooth but not the most comfortable.There was no lounge at Boston for us to use. Typically flying first class overseas comes with lounge privileges. The seats did not recline even a little. My headset only worked on one side. I felt like I was flying on Ryan Air, not Icelandic Air.The flight was delayed and as a consequence we missed our connecting flight. Were stuck for another 6h in Reykyavik. Appreciated that we got a generous food voucher at least. Would have liked to see more information upon arrival including a person waiting for connecting flight travellers and informing already that we will not catch the flight and directing us to the office dealing with the matter; unfortunately that didnt happen and we hence first needed to find out whether flight had indeed left already and then locate the adequate office to help us with booking us on the next connecting flight. Also my suitcase broke and it is not clear whether it is happened on the leg with Iceland Air from DC to Reykyavik or on the leg with Lufthansa from Reykyavik to Frankfurt. Finally, understood that it is a low cost company but at least provision of earplugs for free would have been nice, instead of making them buy.Excellent experience in every way, from ground crew helpfulness, boarding experience, inflight service all the way to modern equipment. My new favorite airline. I wish I could fly with them more often.For a no frills flight this was surprising comfortable. The crew were helpful and nice. The flight was smooth and there were no delays or issues which I haven't had on a flight in a long time. I would definitely fly with them again.The flight was canceled by play less than 24 hours prior to the trip, and I was unable to re-book. Have not received a refund for the trip despite filling out the appropriate form.Was was cancelled less than 24 hours prior to my scheduled departure by PLAY. Despite my attempts to rebook my travel, I encountered significant cost increases that rendered this option unfeasible. In accordance with EC Regulation 261/2004, airlines are required to issue a full refund for cancelled flights within seven days of the scheduled departure if a refund is requested instead of rebooking on another flight. It has been three weeks without a refund or an answerHave not recieved full refund for my flight, which was cancelled less than 24 hours prior to my scheduled departure by PLAY.

This request was completed three weeks ago an answer or refund.It would have been better to have USB charging ports available on the longer haul Flight that one of 2 hoursWas very good Staff was great. No tv monitors tho. So long flights make it longerThe worst. No free beverages. No entertainment on an overseas flight. Not enough space. Never again.Play is affordable! Only way we fly from the states to Europe. Left late but arrived on timehave screens on backs of chairs...offer free snacks and waterThe seating has become ridiculous… like a contest to see how narrow and short they can be made- forcing anyone over 5’1 to pay more to not be twisting oneself into a pretzel. Really insane- would have thought BA was better than this. Frankly- it cancels out a lot of the positive aspects.flight was delayed from BWI to London - missed my connecting flight & then connecting flight (also British Air) was delayed - food is awful, TV & movie selection is greatThree major things that led to my low rating, 1. Internet wasn't available for the whole time, and 2. TV became available way into flight, after numerous system reboots, and 3. Food is not good at all.The flight was fine but no food available apart from snacks like Pringles and olives which was a problem for me as I hadn’t eaten anything that day. But the worst problem was BA left 24 suitcases in Heathrow as the flight was too full but didn’t tell anyone. So we waited for ages at Toulouse airport with no information and finally found out from the one member of staff in the baggage collection area who explained what had happened and apologised for no announcement being made but said that was their policy. Then BA contacted me today to say they have found my luggage and can deliver it to me on Tuesday - half way through my holiday!!!! So a friend has had to make a four hour round trip in his car to go and collect the luggage from the airport so we can get it today. A TOTAL SHAMBLES AND DISREGARD BY BA FOR THEIR PASSENGERS’ BEST INTERESTS.Super tight economy class. My knees were hitting the back of seat in front of me (I'm only 5'6"). My small backpack (sized according to their required dimensions) would not fit under the seat in front of me because there is a box (is that the life jacket?) in the way. Over all, extremely uncomfortable. I forgive the tasteless food, but the tight seating was tortureDidn’t fly with them as someone had cancelled my flightSome how my flight was canceled, neither BA or Justfly.com accepted responsibility. I only found out about this the day before when I tried to check in. I had to book another flight which due to the time ( day before) cost me $300 more. I was still receiving notifications about the flight even when I was on another flight from you. So no my flight to London was not good.Online check-in 24 hours in advance something seems not so easy to check in to pick seats and to print a boarding passI like the crew, very welcoming. Food can be better. The seat arms don’t go up so.
