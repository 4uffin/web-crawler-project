That cause inconvenience for everyone. Otherwise flight was good.Perfect flight both ways. On time, courteous staff, plane comfortable and cool. Best domestic flights I’ve had in awhile.The food was terrible especially for a 15 hour international flight. The crew was unpleasant as well.Really low quality food especially for an international flight. The crew also was surprisingly unpleasant except couple of ladies. I know we were not in first class but that’s no reason to treat customers as less.Flight delayed for two and half hours and then canceled altogether due to mechanical issues. No mechanic onsite to fix so had to send one from LAX.Quick check in. Everything went smooth. I don't know what can be done about airline food.Crew was good. The reservation got mixed up and they didn't have my TSA number. I am also a Silver Medallion and wasn't able to use Sky Priority.Delta made it easy, comfortable and timely. The crew was fantastic.This route with Delta always has delays or is cancelled. Aircrafts seem smaller and older. I fly Delta quite a bit - haven’t had issues with the international flights. But this route has always been the troublesome oneNothing special. The crew never went out of their way for anything.The immigration hall in Amsterdam was understaffed, so passport checking was slower than it should be for a major airport. They need to get the automatic readers up and running for non EU passport holders. Waiting in line after a long flight feels a bit abusive.Over 1 Hr delay. No APU so no AC on ground. Plane was hot during boarding and then they closed the doors over 20 minutes before engine start so interior of plane was steamy hot and stuffy. Could have been helped by opening doors until ready to depart.First of all we couldn’t check in online, then we learn at the airport we were on stand by for KLM’s mistake of overbooking. The seats were not comfy at all. Our luggage got lost.Our first flight was delayed so we missed our connecting flight. However it was easy to book a later flight on their app.My flight was delayed by 6 hours then I missed BOTH of my connecting flights, I then had to stay in the AIRPORT at JFK because soooooo many people also suffered from missing flights and there was no hotels available. I would like to be compensated for this experience! I had to stay in the airport for over 16 hours!Cabin crew professional, polite and friendly, boarding was seemless, but come on KLM surely you can do better than a pack of cheesy biscuits as an inflight snackCabin crew were excellent, very proffesional, polite and friendly, in flight snack was underwhelming, a packet of cheese biscuits, im sure KLM could run to a sandwich!Legroom not all it could be, especially when the seat in front is reclined. Otherwise it was good, food and beverage were nice.This portion of the flight was through Indigo. A local carrier. So all economy seating. No real service some refreshments for purchase standard economy stuff.Transfer at Amsterdam airport is very convenient and the airport is easy to navigate. Boarding was also quick and easy. Cabin crew were excellent and the meals were good, although lacking in options.Handling our luggage was the biggest issue - they lost it and we got it almost 3 days later. Really threw off the beginning of our trip and we really had to change our itinerary accordingly.Seat was hard and uncomfortable and the temperature too warm and uncomfortable.No meals included on this long international flight. Most airlines will offer you a meal when flying internationally. Not Icelandair. Your included choices are water and coffee. Poor customer service. The airport was also very confusing.It was good. The air plane is clean and staff were friendly.Worst airline I’ve ever flown. Delayed 5.5 hrs, missed connecting flight, and missed an entire day of vacation. Zero customer serviceEverything sucked. No food, one small glass of water, a tiny coffee, 5.5 hour delay with no customer service. Would never recommend flying them.The crew was wonderful at check in, the gate and on board. Felt the luggage had more room than the passengers. The seats were smaller than most domestic U.S. airlines. I'm only 5'2" and I had little legroom. There were only 2 bathrooms in coach. Needed more. The flight was very smooth but not the most comfortable.There was no lounge at Boston for us to use. Typically flying first class overseas comes with lounge privileges. The seats did not recline even a little. My headset only worked on one side. I felt like I was flying on Ryan Air, not Icelandic Air.The flight was delayed and as a consequence we missed our connecting flight. Were stuck for another 6h in Reykyavik. Appreciated that we got a generous food voucher at least. Would have liked to see more information upon arrival including a person waiting for connecting flight travellers and informing already that we will not catch the flight and directing us to the office dealing with the matter; unfortunately that didnt happen and we hence first needed to find out whether flight had indeed left already and then locate the adequate office to help us with booking us on the next connecting flight. Also my suitcase broke and it is not clear whether it is happened on the leg with Iceland Air from DC to Reykyavik or on the leg with Lufthansa from Reykyavik to Frankfurt. Finally, understood that it is a low cost company but at least provision of earplugs for free would have been nice, instead of making them buy.Great experience on Icelandair flight from Newark to Amsterdam by way of Reykjavík. Courteous and professional staff. Food was solid. Service - outstanding. Cabin was a little warm.They gave us sandwiches as a meal twice. Snacks mid flight with cookies and a tuna panini. Then just the same tuna panini for dinner. That was it.Top notch re cleanliness, comfort, operational. Attendants attentive, cheerful, courteous and professional. An unusually high-grade experience all around.The staff was very good, the only thing was the air conditioning wasn't working during the boarding process so it was very hot inside the plane until we got airborne. The food wasn't great, the chicken was dry and hard to cut, the ravioli was ok and the little pizza pocket thing was pretty bad. Other than that is was a good flight all aroundBetter consideration for families traveling with a disabled person. They insisted each person hold their own boarding pass on their own devices and gave us a hard time accepting eight boarding passes on a single device.Two of my four flights had issues with toilets either NOT fully operational or completely out of order. Boarding was a joke because they have NOT established who is running the show. In the end, she did a terrible job. The seats 💺 were loose goose and the drinks and snacks were limiting in choices. Also, following Alitalia as an inspiration was strange since they went out of business.We had a 3 hour delay and then a long taxi to take off. It would have been helpful for the pilot to have communicated more about what was going on. There was no A/C during the wait, and the cabin must have been more than 85 to 90 degrees. The crew gave water to the people in the front but by the time they go to the back of the plane they stopped giving out water. Eventually I went back and asked for some in the rear of the plane (for a second time). The food was close to inedible. I thought on an Italian flight that the pasta would be better than the chick, but honestly, a Swanson's TV dinner would have been better. I had a bite or two to keep my blood sugar up, but basically I couldn't eat it.Boarding was chaotic. Service was poor. Attendant was slow and rude. In business class, I was not offered a drink until 1.5 hrs,after takeoff. Food was inedible.Terrible. They canceled 2 flights and then sent everyone by BUS from Rome. They should make amends by offering some sort of compensation.We ordered a gluten free meal and never got it!The company tries shamelessly to squeeze every dollar)Euro out of its passengers. During the check-in the force you to go through the seat selection, you can skip it. They will assign you the worst seat available, then show you the other available seats on the map, for a fee. But they won't show you the fee until you click on it. And once you do click, there's no way to unselect it!! You will get stuck and forced to pay for that seat. Cheaters!!The seating has become ridiculous… like a contest to see how narrow and short they can be made- forcing anyone over 5’1 to pay more to not be twisting oneself into a pretzel. Really insane- would have thought BA was better than this. Frankly- it cancels out a lot of the positive aspects.flight was delayed from BWI to London - missed my connecting flight & then connecting flight (also British Air) was delayed - food is awful, TV & movie selection is greatThree major things that led to my low rating, 1. Internet wasn't available for the whole time, and 2. TV became available way into flight, after numerous system reboots, and 3. Food is not good at all.Super tight economy class. My knees were hitting the back of seat in front of me (I'm only 5'6"). My small backpack (sized according to their required dimensions) would not fit under the seat in front of me because there is a box (is that the life jacket?) in the way. Over all, extremely uncomfortable. I forgive the tasteless food, but the tight seating was tortureDidn’t fly with them as someone had cancelled my flightSome how my flight was canceled, neither BA or Justfly.com accepted responsibility. I only found out about this the day before when I tried to check in. I had to book another flight which due to the time ( day before) cost me $300 more. I was still receiving notifications about the flight even when I was on another flight from you. So no my flight to London was not good.Online check-in 24 hours in advance something seems not so easy to check in to pick seats and to print a boarding passI like the crew, very welcoming. Food can be better. The seat arms don’t go up so. I could use the empty seat next to mine to relax better. 3hrs delay 😠Boarding was efficient and quick, crew was very attentive, seats were comfortable.Everything was very good! I personally struggled with the heat in the cabin for the first 2 hoursDelta7.9KLM7.8Icelandair7.0ITA Airways6.7British Airways6.7Everything you need to know for your flight from Baltimore to RomeAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsInformation on your arrival and departure airportsBaltimore (BWI)Cabin class types available on flights from Baltimore to RomeCabin classes available on flights from Baltimore to Rome.
