function readFormData() {
var formData = {};
formData["fullName"] = document.getElementById("fullName").value;
formData["empCode"] = document.getElementById("empCode").value;
formData["salary"] = document.getElementById("salary").value;
formData["city"] = document.getElementById("city").value;
return formData;
}
function insertNewRecord(data) {
var table = document.getElementById("employeeList").getElementsByTagName('tbody')[0];
var newRow = table.insertRow(table.length);
