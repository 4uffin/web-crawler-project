Image source, Turning Point USAImage caption, Erika Kirk says "most of all, Charlie loved his children" and says she's at a loss for how to explain their father's sudden deathThe killing of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk, and the following manhunt, sparked a wave of international reaction from across the political divide.A single shot was fired at Kirk during an event at Utah Valley University on Wednesday and his death was announced by US President Donald Trump a short while later.His widow, Erika Kirk, vows to never let his legacy die, saying in her first public statement on Friday: "The movement my husband built will not die."On Friday, President Trump was the first to say that the suspected killer had been caught. During an interview with Fox News, he simply said: "I think we have him." Utah Governor Spencer Cox later confirmed the arrest at a news conference and named the murder suspect as 22-year-old Tyler Robinson. He is due to be formally charged on Tuesday.Officials said Robinson had been convinced by his father to turn himself in to police.Image source, Getty ImagesCox said a family member told authorities Robinson had become "more political" in recent years, as messages found on bullet casings at the scene said "Hey fascist! Catch!" and "if you read this you are gay lmao".Trump called for Robinson to be handed the death penalty.Tributes and vigils have been taking place across America, and internationally, following Kirk's death, as questions have been raised over political violence in the US.And that brings us up to date - stay with us as we continue to monitor the latest developments.
