Image source, BBC/Christal HayesAs we've just reported Utah Valley University is due to resume classes on 17 September, the BBC has also heard reaction to Charlie Kirk's death from some of the students.Moments after taking his front-row seat to
see Charlie Kirk speak, Utah Valley University student Scott Sperry watched in
shock as a sniper bullet rang out and blood started pouring from Kirk's neck. The images, he said, he still can't shake,
but he thinks the loss will only strengthen the movement Kirk inspired him to
join."When you try to silence a voice like
this, they don't go away - you only amplify it," sophomore Sperry tells
the BBC. "There are now going to be a million Charlie Kirks, and I feel
like that's the thing that we need to do.""We're going to lead the way," he says. "We owe it to Charlie."Students with various political ideologies
- including those vehemently opposed to Kirk's beliefs - told the BBC they've
felt a personal sense of responsibility to ensure healthy debates on college
campuses continue."Something like this - it's only going
to really help what Charlie was doing," UVU sophomore Jeb Jacobi says,
adding that he believes the number of people involved in the school's Turning
Point USA chapter will balloon.
