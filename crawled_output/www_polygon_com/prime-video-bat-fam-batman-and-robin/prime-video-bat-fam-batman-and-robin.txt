Director Mike Roth shared his love for Joel Schumacher’s campy 1997 film Batman & Robin by making Mr. Freeze, Poison Ivy, and Bane part of an aging rogue’s gallery in his 2023 family-friendly Christmas movie Merry Little Batman. He’s paying further tribute to Batman & Robin in BAT-FAM, his animated sitcom coming to Prime Video in November. The follow-up to Merry Little Batman will see the return of Luke Wilson’s Batman taking on the challenges of raising young Damian Wayne (Yonas Kibreab) with the help of his faithful butler, Alfred Pennyworth (James Cromwell). Alfred is joined by his grandniece Alicia Pennyworth (London Hughes). The character’s name is a nod to Alicia Silverstone, who played Alfred’s niece Barbara Wilson, aka Batgirl, in Batman & Robin — a major shift Schumacher made from the comics, where Barbara is Commissioner Gordon’s daughter. Rather than donning a costume of her own, BAT-FAM’s Alicia Pennyworth will be working to rehabilitate former supervillains.

That work starts in Wayne Manor, which will be home to three supervillains who have fallen on hard times. Ra’s al Ghul (Michael Benyaer) has been effectively turned into a ghost due to a magical mishap, so instead of leading the League of Shadows he’s just doting on his grandson, Damian. Volcana (Haley Tju), the pyrokineticist introduced in a 1998 episode of Superman: The Animated Series, has been de-aged into a 12-year-old by the Lazarus Pit and is now playing the role of Damian’s sarcastic big sister. Man-Bat (Bobby Moynihan) is the family’s slacker roommate, squatting in the belfry and spending his time playing video games and raiding the fridge. BAT-FAM will follow the Bat-Family as they navigate domestic issues and try to keep Gotham safe, providing a cutesy alternative to the raunchy comedy of HBO Max’s Harley Quinn or Prime Video’s dark tribute to Batman: The Animated Series, Batman: Caped Crusader. Fans will be able to get a first look at the show at an Oct. 11 sneak peek screening at New York Comic Con.
