The CEOs of Discord, Steam, Twitch, and Reddit have been called to Congress to testify about the "radicalization of online forum users" on those platforms, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee announced Wednesday. "Congress has a duty to oversee the online platforms that radicals have used to advance political violence," said chairman of the House Oversight Committee James Comer, a Republican from Kentucky, in a statement. "To prevent future radicalization and violence, the CEOs of Discord, Steam, Twitch, and Reddit must appear before the Oversight Committee and explain what actions they will take to ensure their platforms are not exploited for nefarious purposes." Letters from the House Oversight Committee have been sent to Humam Sakhnini, CEO of Discord; Gabe Newell, president of Steam maker Valve; Dan Clancy, CEO of Twitch; and Steve Huffman, CEO of Reddit, requesting their testimony on Oct. 8. "The hearing will examine radicalization of online forum users, including incidents of open incitement to commit violent politically motivated acts," Comer said in a letter to each CEO. The catalyst for Comer's request is the killing of Charlie Kirk, the right-wing political activist and media personality who was shot at Utah Valley University last week. The suspect in that case, Tyler Robinson, is reported to have used Discord to discuss the killing after the fact, and is alleged to have been steeped in online meme culture. Steam and Discord have long been homes for extremists to gather, coordinate, and harass their perceived enemies, despite both platforms being aimed at gamers and designed originally for non-political purposes. The 2017 white supremacist rally Unite the Right in Charlottesville, Virginia was planned through Discord, and the platform was used by far-right mass shooters in the 2022 Buffalo shooting and the Highland Park Parade shooting. In 2024, the Anti-Defamation League reported that Steam was "rife with extremism and antisemitism" across Steam Community groups. Congress has previously pressed Newell on the "significant presence of users displaying and espousing neo-Nazi, extremist, racial supremacist, misogynistic, and other hateful sentiments" on Steam. Discord, Steam, Twitch, and Reddit execs will have the chance to deliver five-minute opening statements prior to answering questions posed by members of the committee during October's testimony.

It'll be REALLY interesting when those CEO's get up there and say most the extreme content is racist and right wing extremism and watch how the congressmen react.

Hmmm someone’s missing there. Now who could it be?
Someone who recently bought an entire social media platform, and has a direct effect on the kind of content that gets put on there maybe?nah. Probably no one important.

Congress is specifically going after video games. They have been biting at the bit to do this for awhile now, and the shooting last week of a prominent Republican party member that made them a lot of money, is the perfect excuse for them.

But of course the Republican party calls tech CEOs to testify over user-generated content and conversation.

these people have no clue. its their inaction [to help citizens/their constituents] or conversely their action [to help billionaires and foreign governments] that radicalizes people.

No doubt we'll get amazing information from these proceedings. They'll ask questions like they asked Zuck, 'What is The Facebook?'. Truly riveting.

lol Congress isnt going to like hearing that Steam is actually a far-right cesspool. I dont know about Twitch and Discord. Asmongold is the largest streamer on Twitch and he is far-right and pushes fascist ideology really hard, Twitch does nothing to stop it, so they probably won't like hearing that either. Congress is going into this wanting to nail these platforms for only left-leaning ideology, and they are going to learn quickly that these places are not like that at all.

It doesn't matter if it's a far right or far left cesspool. This is just the latest in literal decades of attacks on videogames as part of a larger/wider push to control what content children/adults can and cannot have access to.They want to nail the platforms for existing outside their control. Everything else is just a smokescreen.

it's just that this wouldnt be happening if the shooter was overwhelmingly believed to have been a far-right extremist. far-right domestic terrorist attacks make up 95% of that category of attacks in the U.S. but every single time a major one happens? The government is completely silent about it, at best they say thoughts and prayers, and talk about the need for protecting gun rights. This is a pretty clear cut escalation historically.

Look forward to seeing yet another CEO testimony where CEOs get up and suddenly and inexplicable know absolutely nothing about their own businesses, while congress asks questions completely missing or misunderstanding the matter at hand. Always a useful show.
