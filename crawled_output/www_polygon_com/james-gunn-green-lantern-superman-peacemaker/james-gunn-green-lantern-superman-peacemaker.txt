As of the beginning of James Gunn‚Äôs Superman, the Man of Steel holds the title as the most powerful known metahuman. That changes quickly. Not only does Superman lose his first fight in the film‚Äôs opening moments, Gunn says there‚Äôs another character in the mix who could beat him. In the mailbag section of episode four of Peacemaker: The Official Podcast, Tim Meadows was asked which comic book character he‚Äôd like to have his bird blind A.R.G.U.S. agent Langston Fleury fight. Living up to Fleury‚Äôs arrogance, he said Green Lantern, to which Gunn responded, ‚ÄúWow, you‚Äôre going to get killed, dude.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure Superman would beat Green Lantern. I definitely don‚Äôt think Langston Fleury‚Äôs going to beat Green Lantern,‚Äù Gunn explained. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs Superman, but it‚Äôs still a fight. It‚Äôs a real fight.‚Äù

Superman and Green Lantern have faced off in various DC Comics crossovers before, and the match-up usually goes in Superman‚Äôs favor. The Soviet version of Superman dispatched an entire group of Green Lanterns in Red Son. Hal Jordan was able to knock Superman out in a 1995 issue of the Green Lantern comic by Ron Marz, but he was getting a power boost from being possessed by the evil parasitic entity Parallax. Meadows‚Äô co-stars had far less ambitious goals. Jennifer Holland said she wanted Emilia Harcourt to fight Rick Flagg Sr., though Gunn doesn‚Äôt think Frank Grillo‚Äôs ego could stand it. Harcourt suggested they might just team up to fight someone else as a compromise. Steve Agee said John Economos clearly can‚Äôt beat anyone in a fight, but he could get into a pie-eating contest with Matter-Eater Lad, where Economos ate a pie and the Legion of Super-Heroes member ate an entire IHOP. Gunn also confirmed that the time-traveling hero is canon in the DCU, so maybe we‚Äôll see him and some of his teammates from the 31st century in a future project.

Probably depends a bit on the lantern, since what they can and will do with the ring power does relate to their personalities, but I also think that Supes could probably figure out a way to last until the ring needs a recharge... Unless we aren't doing ring recharges in the movies.

The new movie proved exactly why he could without them fighting in it. If a Lantern (or anyone) could cut off Superman's airflow reliably, Superman would die. Points added if sheathing him in a construct also blocks the sun.

Only if you can contain him for the weeks it would take for him to need to take a breath.

Eventually Gunn will depower superman so much and lower his intelligence to the point he will be a much weaker version of guardians of the galaxy drax. Eventually he will destroy what's little left of the DC universe.
