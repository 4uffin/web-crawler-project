For the second time in six months, Microsoft is raising prices on Xbox hardware in the United States. New prices on Xbox Series X and Series S consoles will go into effect on Oct. 3, the company announced Friday, "due to changes in the macroeconomic environment." Here's what it will cost to buy a new Xbox console, starting in October:
Xbox Series S 512 GB — $399.99 (was $379.99)
Xbox Series S 1TB — $449.99 (was $429.99)
Xbox Series X Digital — $599.99 (was $549.99)
Xbox Series X — $649.99 (was $599.99)
Xbox Series X 2TB Galaxy Black Special Edition — $799.99 (was $729.99)
The Xbox maker previously raised prices in May. Prior to that round of hikes, an Xbox Series X was $499.99, but that price will have jumped a whopping $150 by Oct. 3. The Xbox Series X 2TB Galaxy Black Special Edition has gone up by even more: It was $599.99 on April 30, and will be $200 more expensive this fall. In cold comfort, Microsoft says that pricing for Xbox controllers and headsets will remain the same, and that pricing in non-U.S. markets will remain the same. Microsoft's latest price increase comes one month after rival Sony announced a $50 across-the-board increase on PlayStation 5 consoles in the U.S. Nintendo made a similar move in August, raising the price of original Switch consoles and Joy-Con 2 controllers for Switch 2. With U.S. President Donald Trump's chaotic and punitive tariffs on goods manufactured in China, Vietnam, and India raising prices for companies (and being passed on to consumers), there's no telling if this is the last of the price fluctuations Americans will be forced to endure this year.

We don’t manufacture the parts here and the parts would be subject to tariffs. It would take years to get a plant up and running, which would be a waste when tariffs will likely be gone under the next administration.

just remember folks, these companies are also not the good guy. to pass cost increases due to tariffs to the customer is a CHOICE that both companies that produce goods and retailers elect to do.
Its not a matter of course.
Its not a law of science. Both politicians and executives are failing the real people in this country.
