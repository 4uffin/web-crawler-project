About Tasha Robinson
Tasha Robinson is the entertainment editor at Polygon, writing about whatever she can get away with: Movies, TV, books, graphic novels, TTRPGs, fandom, and anything else in the cultural sphere. She loves classic noir and neo-noir movies, animation, musicals, and Terry Gilliam before he lost the plot.
Tasha has worked as a cultural editor and film specialist at The A.V. Club, Pitchfork’s film site The Dissolve, and The Verge. Her writing has appeared at NPR, The Chicago Tribune, io9, Vulture, RogerEbert.com, and The L.A. Times, among other publications.
Tasha is a longtime podcaster and co-host of The Next Picture Show, a movie-of-the-week podcast that compares new releases to older classics and puts movies in a cultural context. She periodically designs elaborate LARPs and much less elaborate TTRPGs, and is an enthusiastic participant in the Indie Games on Demand community. Find her on itch.io.
