Hades celebrates its five-year 1.0 launch anniversary with a return to Game Pass on Sept. 17. It highlights the second wave of titles coming to Game Pass in September. SuperGiant Games' Hades is one of the best roguelikes around, and was previously a Game Pass staple. You play as Zagreus, son of Hades (the god of the dead), as he fights his way out of Hades (the underworld). Its gameplay is fast and frantic as Zagreus uses a variety of weapons, like a trident or a gun, to vanquish his foes of the underworld (and his papa). Hades returns to Game Pass at the perfect moment as players might want to sharpen their reflexes in time for the 1.0 release of Hades 2 a week later. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 (the 2023 game, not the original 2011 one) will be made available with Game Pass Standard on Sept. 17. It closes out the rebooted Modern Warfare trilogy, though a rushed development period resulted in a disappointing campaign capper for the series. But, hey, at least this Modern Warfare has a zombies mode. Here's everything hitting Game Pass by the end of September:
RoadCraft (Cloud and Xbox Series X) (Game Pass Ultimate, Game Pass Standard)
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 (Console) (Now with Game Pass Standard) – Sept. 17
For the King 2 (Console) (Now with Game Pass Standard) – Sept. 17
Overthrown (Game Preview) (Xbox Series X) (Now with Game Pass Standard) – Sept. 17
Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X) (Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass) – Sept. 17
Frostpunk 2 (Cloud and Xbox Series X) (Game Pass Ultimate) – Sept. 18
Wobbly Life (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X) (Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, Game Pass Standard) – Sept. 18
Hades (Cloud, Console, and PC) (Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, Game Pass Standard) – Sept. 19
Endless Legend 2 (Game Preview) (PC) (Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass) – Sept. 22
Sworn (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X) (Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass) – Sept. 23
Peppa Pig: World Adventures (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X) (Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, Game Pass Standard) – Sept. 25
Visions of Mana (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X) (Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, Game Pass Standard) – Sept. 25

This new wave of Game Pass additions rounds out the month's titles, headlined by a little ol' game named Hollow Knight: Silksong.
