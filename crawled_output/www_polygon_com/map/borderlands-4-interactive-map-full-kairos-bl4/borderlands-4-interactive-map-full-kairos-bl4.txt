The Borderlands 4 map is a first for Borderlands: a truly open world, rather than a series of interconnected open-ish areas. Borderlands 4 is set on Kairos, a planet ruled by the Timekeeper and full of stuff. Like, a scary amount of stuff. What that means for the looter-shooter (and for you, the player) is that there are a lot of collectibles for you to find and regions to explore. Our Borderlands 4 interactive map — which, bear in mind, is an ongoing work in progress as we strive to complete the game — will help you find that stuff. Respec machines and fast travel spots are few and far between, but you'll see them on this map. We also show you where to find vendors to stock up on shields, ammo, and of course, more guns than you can possibly imagine. And if you're a collectible-hunter, we've got you covered with icons for Dead Bolts, Electi Safes, and Evocarium. Below, see our full Borderlands 4 interactive map of Kairos. [Ed. note: Spoilers follow for Borderlands 4. If you'd like to discover the game at your own pace, bookmark this page and come back later.]
