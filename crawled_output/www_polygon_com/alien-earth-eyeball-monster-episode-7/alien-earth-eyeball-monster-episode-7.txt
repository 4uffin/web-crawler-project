If this thing hasn't crawled into someone's skull by the end of the season, I'm going to lose it

Alien: Earth episode 7 ends with Wendy (Sydney Chandler) furiously chewing out her brother Joe (Alex Lawther) for reasons I can’t explain without spoiling the entire plot. Suffice to say, Wendy is mad, and rightfully so. "What did you do?!" Wendy screams at him twice, utterly incredulous at his actions.Ed. note: Spoilers ahead for Alien: Earth episode 7.Honestly, I have the same question, but it's not for Joe, it's for the ever-shoeless Prodigy CEO Boy Kavalier (Samuel Blenkin). In his infinite wisdom — and hubris — Kavalier decides to move the "eyeball alien" (aka, t. ocellus or Species 64) after it orchestrated the death of the science-minded Hybrid Isaac in episode 6. Instead of a secure containment cell in Prodigy's lab, Alien: Earth's most dangerous non-Xenomorph creature is now just chilling in a portable containment tube in the middle of Kavalier's office. What could possibly go wrong? T. ocellus doesn't get a ton of screentime in episode 7, titled "Emergence," but it once again steals the show in the few moments viewers do get to spend with it. All hell has broken loose in Neverland — Wendy helped the Xenomorph she's been nurturing escape the facility, and it now roams the island, attacking anything that gets in Wendy's way as she, Joe, and Nibs (Lily Newmark) make their escape. Despite her recent memory-wipe, Nibs is still clearly not okay — she says as much when the Hybrids stumble across the graves where their organic bodies lie buried. "We're not dead," Wendy asserts. "We're still here." "I don't think I am anymore..." Nibs mumbles back, gazing at some dead foliage that was covering her burial site.
Despite her memory wipe, Nibs is still talking to her stuffed bird, Mr. Strawberry, about something that's "inside" of her.

The Hybrids, collectively known as The Lost Boys, really are lost now, after Prodigy scientist Arthur (David Rysdahl) turned off their trackers in Episode 6. But all Boy Kavalier cares about at this moment is t. ocellus, and hell, I can't even blame him. It's a fascinating creature. I'm just not sure displaying it in his office like an especially deadly fish tank is a particularly good idea. Now residing in its small containment unit on the floor of Kavalier's office, t. ocellus shows us exactly how intelligent it is. Kavalier writes the first few digits of pi on his hand — 3.14 — and asks t. ocellus to tell him the next three digits, assuming that any intelligent species would have discovered such a fundamental concept. Seeing this possessed sheep-corpse stomp out the next two numbers in the pi sequence before unceremoniously taking a dump might be the scariest shit (literally) we've seen on the show so far. Sure, the scene's ending is somewhat played for laughs, but what follows isn't: T. ocellus starts bleating angrily. Even Kavalier's creepy manservant, Atom (Adrian Edmondson), seems freaked out by what he's witnessing.
As annoying as I find him, Boy Kavalier and I have one thing in common: We both really want to hear what t. ocellus has to say.

"Sir, I must renew my concerns," Atom gently tells Kavalier. "If this creature were to escape and embed itself in the human population—" But Kavalier takes this warning as a suggestion instead, interrupting Atom to declare he wants to find a human to "feed" to t. ocellus. "You're right, we should… yeah, we should switch it into a person," Kavalier declares, completely missing the point. "Y'know, someone who talks and uses a toilet." Kavalier says he knows "just who to use" for this perverse little experiment, but we don't get to see who the footwear-averse CEO has in mind. Still, given the fact that Boy Kavalier himself can talk and use a toilet, I'm praying he's the next character on t. ocellus' (s)hit list. Mainly because I'm tired of hearing Kavalier talk, but I'm absolutely dying to know what t. ocellus has to say.

My prediction: Boy will try to feed the mommy scientist to Species 64, and Species 64 will choose Boy, instead. I've always assumed that they cast a bug-eyed actor for Boy as a form of foreshadowing. I guess we'll know soon!

This is my guess too. I just hope it isn't used as a hook for a second season that may or may not happen years from now.

Claire: first of all, I have enjoyed reading your recaps of each episode so far this season :) That being said, my bet is on Isaac (Tootles) being the test subject for The Eye in Episode 8.
You correctly predicted Isaac would be targeted by The Eye, in your recap of Episode 4. I think the fact that they showed Isaac's left eye being destroyed in Episode 6 by The Fly is the answer to your theory after Episode 4. Remember, in Episode 7, Kirsch stated to Boy Kavalier that Isaac's isn't completely gone, that there is a chance his consciousness can still be "salvaged".

It's pretty clear this thing needs a central nervous system to highjack. It won't be the synths.
