Eminem might make an appearance but if he doesn't I don't think Crawford would be short of musical options.I caught up with British rapper Stormzy at the weigh-in and his prediction? "Crawford, Crawford, Crawford, Crawford."American hip-hop stars Wiz Khalifa and Chance the Rapper both backed Bud on the red carpet when I spoke to them too.To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.This video can not be played

Saul 'Canelo' Avarez also opts for the black ringwalk outfit. Looks like velvet with gold trim. Flanked by all his world titles.

Terence Crawford is marching to the ring holding a guitar case with a smirk on his face. Not sure anyone would've predicted a Mexican band to be playing while he walks out. Fair play. Image source, Getty Images

Terence Crawfordâs CV is a masterpiece: Ricky Burns in 2014, cleaning out light-welterweight and welterweight, destroying Errol Spence Jr in 2023. Four weight classes, two undisputed reigns, Hall of Fame credentials already locked in.But heâs not the global face of boxing like Alvarez. Maybe thatâs because his divisions lacked superstar rivals. Maybe itâs because he doesnât seek the spotlight.Still, thereâs a question tonight over ring rust. Heâs fought just once since July 2023. His fight against Israil Madrimov last year was tough. Can he flick the switch back to elite level against the sportâs biggest attraction?

Setting alarms? Pfft, amateur. As a fan of American football, UFC and the boxing my body clock is set to stay awake until 6am Saturday night/Sunday morning and utilise Sunday for what itâs for: a good lay in.Nathan, Manchester

The combined record of Canelo's past 10 opponents is quite astounding at 288-9-2.He has handed William Scull, Edgar Berlanga, Jaime Munguia, Caleb Plant, Billy Joe Saunders and Callum Smith their first loss in the last five. Incredible.
