Alvarez really looking to land clean with that overhand right. Crawford is answering with some serious combinations though - this is special.

More spite in the punches from Alvarez now as he chases this fight but Crawford lands another left hook of his own. Neither fighter showing any real signs of tiring so far as Alvarez looks to land huge overhand rights but can't land on the slippery Crawford.Two to go.

Wow! Both of them steam out of their corners and start to unload on each other and Crawford stands and trades with Alvarez while landing some huge blows. The best action of the fight so far. They trade again in the middle of the ring and another hard left hook lands on the head of Alvarez. Best round of the fight so far. Image source, Getty Images

Both men come in close after a ferocious start to the round and there's a clash of heads. Crawford has a cut above his right eye but it's ruled as an accidental head butt.

It's interesting there. Crawford looked at Canelo and Canelo extended his glove and Crawford didn't oblige.

Do we think Alvarez knows he's losing? At what point do we see him start unloading?
