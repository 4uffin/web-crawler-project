Award Recipients
Most Valuable Contributor: Jan Faracik
Jan has made tremendous contributions to the UI/UX front of the Jenkins project as the UI/UX SIG Lead, not just this year but throughout the years, and for helping to foster a collaborative environment especially in helping newcomers of the Jenkins ecosystem via code reviews.
Security MVP: Daniel Beck
Daniel brought skills and thorough efforts to maintain and improve the security of Jenkins. His code reviews for Jenkins core are great examples of attention to detail and awareness of impact. He reviews security threats carefully and keeps himself current on recent security topics. He works well with release leads when delivering Jenkins security releases and works well with the Jenkins infrastructure team in many different areas.
Most Valuable Advocate: Stefan Spieker
Stefan has made continuous efforts in advocating Jenkins in his company with excellent explanations and showcases. He organized Hacktoberfest, and encouraged other colleagues to contribute to Open Source, specifically Jenkins.
