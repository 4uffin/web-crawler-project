As part of this, we are a founding member of Frontier, an advance market commitment to purchase an initial $1 billion of permanent carbon removal by 2030.We back groundbreaking technologies that are removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or preventing its release in the first place.Carbon-rich waste that's injected deep underground, fans sponging the air of greenhouse gasses, devices that capture emissions from semi-trucks as they drive – no solution is too ambitious or too crazy.Our goal is to help prove, scale, and commercialize climate technology for massive impact in the long term. Because at the end of the day, commerce can only thrive if our planet thrives too.Explore our Sustainability FundShopify merchants and app developersShopify PlanetShopify merchants can use Planet to offer carbon-neutral shipping, helping them appeal to modern consumers, all while supporting the same trailblazing projects that Shopify backs.Planet works by estimating shipping emissions, and enabling both merchants and their customers to neutralize the carbon produced by their shipments.
