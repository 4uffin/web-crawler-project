It’s how businesses can do more with what they have.Why do I need ecommerce automation?The problem is simple: as a business scales, the demands, complexity, and repetition add up. Systems that used to work become increasingly inefficient and break down. In response, companies turn to time-consuming workarounds—time that could be spent on what’s important is sacrificed for time spent on what’s urgent, even when that’s just pushing buttons. Or companies turn to new hires. Unfortunately, people don’t scale. But that doesn’t undercut the value of people—if anything, it reinforces it. People, especially their ability to focus on key activities, not tasks that a workflow could do, are your most powerful resource.What are some workflow automation examples?Ecommerce automations can take a host of different forms like tagging customers for segmentation and marketing, hiding products and initiating reorders for low or out-of-stock items, or tracking and halting high-risk orders. With each workflow, the goal is the same: to let merchants build the workflow that their business needs to scale.
Here are some of the most popular examples:
Inventory management: Unpublish out-of-stock products and send a Slack message or email to your marketing team so they can pause advertising Fraud prevention: Send an email to review an order over $5000, before fulfillment as that is atypical for the store Product reviews: Automatically create a customer support ticket and send a slack message when a negative review is posted Loyalty: Award loyalty points and send a thank you SMS after a customer makes their second purchase How does workflow automation work on Flow?Flow is based on a simple, no-code “trigger, condition, and action” format. Basically, a “trigger” is an event that Flow looks out for and which sets an automation in motion, a “condition” must then be met, and the “action” is the task that is completed when the condition is met.
Here’s what that might look like for a workflow that automatically adds a customer to your loyalty program:
Trigger: An order is placed. Condition: The order total must be $500 or more. Action: The customer is tagged as a VIP in the system. How do I start automating ecommerce workflows?It’s so easy.
