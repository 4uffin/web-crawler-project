But more important than what it is, is what it isn’t.
Ecommerce is not a luxury. It’s not one strategy among many. Becoming an online business is a necessity. Recent studies show that around 2.71 billion consumers will shop online in 2024.
Unfortunately, ecommerce is also fraught with questions: Where to invest? What countries present the best product-market fit? How do you attract non-local buyers? Which is most important: translation, currencies, payment options, or something else entirely?
This guide will give you an inside look at global ecommerce, with tips on how you can expand into the market.
What is global ecommerce?
Global ecommerce is the selling of products or services across geopolitical borders from a company’s country of origin, normally defined as its founding or incorporating location. Products or services are sold into non-native markets via online sales and marketing.
The advantages of international ecommerce are:
Easier expansion into foreign markets
Easier-to-find product-market fit
Shorter B2B sales cycles
Quicker building of international presence
Lower barriers to entry
Worldwide, it is anticipated that B2B ecommerce will reach $36 trillion by 2026. And B2C ecommerce will reach $5.5 trillion by 2027.
How big is the ecommerce market?
The global ecommerce market is expected to total $4.8 trillion in 2025. That figure is estimated to grow over the next few years, showing that borderless ecommerce is becoming a profitable option for online retailers. By 2027, about 23% of total retail sales will happen online.
International Trade Administration
Casey Armstrong, CMO at ecommerce fulfillment brand ShipBob, adds, “While a lot of focus in ecommerce centers around the United States and Canada, there is a lot to learn from other large international players who are seeing an even more accelerated ecommerce growth rate.
“Merchants can shift where they sell based on this data and the demand for ecommerce from these countries. At ShipBob, it’s why we have opened fulfillment centers in Canada and the UK and are about to open another in Australia.”
Top global ecommerce statistics
If you’re running an online store, staying updated on the ecommerce industry is important for maximizing revenue. Below are the top statistics from around the world, so you can be more prepared for the year ahead.
1. LATAM continues to adopt ecommerce in coming years.
Latin America (including Peru, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, and Mexico) will see a 22% growth between 2023 and 2026—accumulating more than $700 billion in total combined online retail sales. There’s a growing middle class and increasing disposable income in LATAM. Ecommerce is one of many goods and services that are benefiting from this socioeconomic shift.
2. The Philippines’ ecommerce market is the fasting growing in the world.
The Philippines’ ecommerce market is the fastest-growing in the world, with a 24.1% growth in sales in 2023. The Philippines is on track to become an upper-middle-class country by 2025, with more disposable incomes and consumer spending.
PH has a relatively young population that’s more tech-savvy and open to adopting new technologies. This makes ecommerce in the country a ripe market. The Philippine government has initiatives to boost the digital economy, including improving internet infrastructure and adopting policies that encourage digital payments, ecommerce operations, and growth.
3. Almost half of US shoppers plan to spend more online in 2024.
Roughly 42% of American respondents in a survey stated they planned to spend more online over the next year, Retail Dive reports.
A major driver for making online purchases is convenience, while the biggest drawback—not being able to try products—is becoming less of a concern. According to survey results, 29% of respondents rated low prices as the top feature of online shopping, followed by shipping times and costs (21%), selection (21%), and user-friendliness (19%).
4. As of January 2024, the average conversion rate across ecommerce sites was 1.88%, a 0.14% increase from the previous year.
IRP Commerce suggests a positive trend in conversion efficiency globally. While .14% might seem like a small number, it indicates improvements in various factors that influence consumer purchasing decisions, such as website design, user experience, product offerings, pricing, and marketing strategies.
5. The global B2C ecommerce is expected to reach $9 trillion by 2032.
The global B2C ecommerce market reached $4.8 trillion in 2023 and is expected to grow to $9 trillion by 2032—a growth rate of 7% between 2024 and 2027. The continued growth of ecommerce will give brands more opportunities to expand internationally. With tools like Shopify Markets, you can easily handle localization, regulatory requirements, and international payment methods in one place.
6. Social commerce is poised to grow at a CAGR of 30% from 2023 to 2030.
The most recent global social commerce statistics indicate that the market reached $945.92 billion in 2023. It’s projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of around 30%, reaching $13 trillion by 2033. This growth is driven by the increasing integration of social media platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook into ecommerce, particularly with the rising use of livestream shopping and short-form video content.
7. 89% of retailers foresee an increase in revenue between 1% and 9% for 2024.
Deloitte’s 2024 Global Retail Outlook report revealed a generally optimistic outlook for the global retail sector, despite ongoing economic challenges.
After the disruptions caused by COVID-19, retailers have adapted to changes in consumer behavior, particularly the shift to online shopping. As markets stabilize and consumers resume regular spending habits, retailers see more consistent revenue streams.
While this impact is global, European retailers expect higher revenue growth, with a larger proportion anticipating a 5% to 9% increase.
8. 47% of leaders indicated ecommerce profitability is a primary driver of operating margin increases in 2024.
As ecommerce matures, Deloitte found retailers are focusing on making online sales more profitable rather than just expanding market share. Initial efforts to capture ecommerce demand were often made at the expense of margins due to high investments in infrastructure, logistics, and digital transformation.
Now, with infrastructure in place and technology costs stabilizing, retailers are shifting focus to optimizing those operations for profitability.
9. 97% of companies globally reconfigured their supply chains in 2023.
This rising trend highlights the growing recognition among businesses that their supply chains must be more adaptable to external challenges such as geopolitical tensions, fluctuating demand, and cost pressures.
Companies are focusing on mitigating risks and striving to make their supply chains more efficient by incorporating new technologies, diversifying suppliers, and leveraging government incentives.
10. Global lead time for production materials in April 2024 was 79 days.
In April 2024, the average global lead time for production materials was 79 days. While this is a marked improvement from the peak of 100 days in July 2022, it remains above the pre-pandemic average of 65 days in 2019.
11. Shipping rates saw a 193% rate increase since October 2023.
As of February 1, 2024, the rate for shipping from China to the East Coast of the United States was $6,589 for a 40-foot equivalent unit, reflecting a 193% rate increase since October 2023.
This dramatic rise in shipping rates reflects the broader challenges facing global logistics, driven by ongoing supply chain disruptions, capacity constraints, and geopolitical tensions.
12. 46% of retail respondents expect AI to enhance end-to-end supply chain visibility.
Global supply chains are intricate networks spanning multiple geographies, often involving many suppliers, manufacturers, and logistics partners. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed the vulnerabilities of these supply chains, highlighting the need for more resilient, responsive systems
AI is seen as a solution to this challenge because it can process vast amounts of data in real time, enabling retailers to have a more transparent and comprehensive view of their supply chain operations. This means tracking inventory levels, predicting supply chain bottlenecks, and ensuring that goods are moved and delivered as efficiently as possible.
13. Foreign direct investment in North America has grown by 134% since 2020.
The increase in foreign direct investment (FDI) in North America—134% since introducing the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) in 2020—is a pivotal development for global commerce.
In particular, Mexico saw a surge in FDI, landing nearly US$19 billion in the first quarter of 2023 alone, representing a 48% year-over-year increase, with 53% of that investment flowing into the manufacturing sector.
By investing heavily in North American manufacturing, global companies are not only taking advantage of trade agreements like the USMCA, which offers reduced tariffs and other incentives, but also positioning themselves to meet demand more effectively by reducing dependence on far-flung global supply chains, particularly in regions like Asia.
Global ecommerce trends to watch
1. Global inflation pressures
Inflation’s ripple effects continue to be felt across the ecommerce landscape in 2024, influencing not only the cost of goods but also consumer spending and business operations. As raw material and transportation costs rise, ecommerce businesses, particularly those dependent on imports, face the challenge of increased product prices.
This can lead to more price-sensitive consumers, potentially reducing demand and impacting sales and profits.
For example, Retail Economics and Metapack found that 57% of consumers are worried about inflation, which is the biggest concern for consumers in 2023. Also, 72% of shoppers plan to change their buying behavior as a result, with even the most affluent 61% planning to switch up their habits.
Retailers are feeling the burn, with 79% of American retailers feeling the effects of inflation in the past six months. To counter the problem, 72% of retailers plan to raise their prices within the next six months.
Some ecommerce businesses are turning to omnichannel marketing strategies. By engaging customers across multiple touchpoints, businesses can offer a seamless shopping experience, potentially offsetting the dampening effects of inflation on consumer spending.
To stay afloat, ecommerce owners must remain proactive, vigilant, and adaptable, constantly seeking solutions to mitigate inflation’s impact on their operations and maintain competitiveness in the market.
2. More consumers will shop on their smartphones
Consumers love convenience—it’s why they shop online using their mobile phones. But this isn’t a fad. The rise of mobile commerce (m-commerce) is significant, with some forecasting it to reach $558 billion in 2024, accounting for 7.6% of total retail sales.
In 2023, nearly 80% of global consumers used their smartphone to access a retailer’s website while shopping in-store. Another 74% used a retailer’s app while shopping, according to Insider Intelligence.
M-commerce involves shopping online through mobile devices like smartphones or tablets. Mobile ecommerce will continue to break out over the next few years. Technological advances like branded mobile apps, 5G wireless, and social shopping make it easier for people to shop on their phones.
Online retail continues to expand due to the increasing use of smartphones and tablets globally. The global mobile commerce market was worth $2.2 trillion in 2023, making up 60% of all global ecommerce sales. Global social commerce sales are set to reach $1.2 trillion by 2025. And leading this front are millennials and Gen Z online shoppers.
Gen Z is highly engaged in social media shopping and spending, with 68% searching for products on social media and 22% completing a purchase. Following close behind are millennials, with 42% browsing social media for products and 21% completing a purchase.
Expect more branded shopping apps, SMS and Facebook Messenger marketing campaigns, and integrations for mobile-enabled add-ons to boost in-store engagement to influence purchases.
3. A new mix of marketing channels
In recent years, there have been exciting advancements in several areas of advertising—including access to new marketing channels. Social commerce has been on the radar for the past five years, with the release of Facebook and Instagram shopping features, and more recently, TikTok shopping.
However, as an extension of social commerce, live shopping has started to become more popular as the strategy has soared in China. The live commerce market in China was $562 billion in 2023 and is expected to increase to $843 billion in 2025. It made up 19.2% of the retail ecommerce sales in 2023.
In the US, livestreaming was expected to reach $31 billion in 2023, almost triple the size in 2021. Another new marketing channel coming on the horizon is connected TV (CTV) advertising—which refers to ads you’ll find on platforms like Hulu, Roku, and YouTube.
The growth of CTV advertising spend in the US is projected to increase from $25 billion in 2023 to nearly $41 billion by 2027, while linear TV ad spend is expected to decline from $61 billion to $56 billion in the same period. This shift indicates a changing preference among advertisers toward CTV due to its effectiveness and the ability to reach targeted audiences more efficiently.
This is not surprising when you have streaming services achieving a record-breaking milestone, securing 38.7% of the total TV usageshare, while linear TV’s share of total TV viewing dipped below 50% for the first time.
A sweets/confectionary company in the consumer packaged goods (CPG) category credited CTV ads with an overall sales lift of 15.4%. The campaign used two targeting strategies: a broad approach to maximize reach and a more focused strategy targeting VIZIO cord-cutting viewers for incremental growth.
The campaign successfully penetrated new buyer segments and demonstrated the potential for competitive prospecting and reaching consumers new to the brand and category. This case study underscores CTV’s ability to drive top-of-funnel awareness and bottom-of-funnel sales lift.
4. A slowly stabilizing supply chain
The global supply chain has faced a relentless series of disruptions. Recent years have seen a cascade of disruptive events—geopolitical conflicts like the Russia-Ukraine war, attacks in the Red Sea, and the ongoing repercussions of the pandemic.
For instance, the Russia-Ukraine conflict had a profound impact on the flow of critical commodities, leading to shortages and inflationary pressures. The war disrupted the supply of agricultural products, fertilizers, and energy resources. It also led to increased freight charges, container shortages, and lowered international warehousing space availability.
Then there’s the Red Sea, a vital trade corridor plagued by missile strikes. These strikes have caused major shipping companies to reroute or pause operations, resulting in extended voyage times and heightened transportation costs, further straining global supply chains.
In response to ongoing supply chain challenges, companies are adjusting their strategies to enhance resilience. Nearly eight out of 10 companies (79%) are broadening their supplier base, while 71% are pursuing regionalization and localization to mitigate risks from geopolitical tensions and transportation disruptions.
Another 83% of organizations are investing in friend-shoring—building supply networks with countries that are political and economic allies. This shift is part of a broader move toward diversification and innovation in supply chain management, with a notable increase in investments aimed at improving disruption detection and fostering innovative processes.
The Biden-Harris administration has also strengthened supply chain resilience by partnering with allies to diversify sources and investments in domestic capacity. And the White House is collaborating with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and monitoring developments like El Niño for potential impacts on global supply chains.
5. Faster deliveries for everyone, no matter where the customer is
The trend toward faster deliveries is reshaping the global ecommerce landscape, as retailers grapple with the twin pressures of controlling logistics costs and meeting rising consumer expectations for speed.
Logistics and delivery costs, especially last-mile delivery, are major challenges for ecommerce profitability, particularly in Europe and the Middle East.
Still, retailers expect two-thirds of deliveries to be fulfilled within the same day or next day by 2029, showing a shift toward rapid delivery expectations.
As more consumers choose retailers based on their ability to provide rapid delivery, companies that fail to meet these expectations risk losing out to competitors who can. In markets where speed of service is increasingly seen as part of the value proposition, this demand for faster delivery puts pressure on ecommerce businesses to enhance their global fulfillment capabilities.
To meet the demand for rapid delivery, retailers are heavily investing in logistics infrastructure, especially in automated and micro-fulfillment centers. These smaller, more localized warehouses are strategically placed near urban centers, allowing quicker and more efficient deliveries. Some 64% of retailers anticipate the expansion of automated micro-fulfillment centers within the next five years, supporting the growth of ecommerce and quick deliveries.
6. Online returns are growing with ecommerce
The rise in ecommerce returns has become one of the most pressing challenges for online businesses, directly impacting profitability and supply chain efficiency.
One of the main contributors to this issue is the popularity of free-return policies, which many retailers have adopted to attract and retain customers. While these policies encourage more sales by reducing the risk for the consumer, they also inadvertently lead to higher return rates.
“Bracketing” is a common consumer behavior where shoppers order the same item in different sizes, colors, or variations, intending to keep only one and return the rest. While this enhances the online shopping experience for consumers, it creates a significant logistical and financial burden for retailers.
Processing returns is expensive. When a product is returned, the retailer incurs costs related to reverse logistics, restocking, repackaging, and sometimes refurbishing or discounting the item.
Retailers are increasingly turning to technology and consumer education to address rising return rates. By providing better product information upfront, retailers can help shoppers make more informed choices, reducing the likelihood of returns.
For instance, improved size guides in fashion ecommerce, detailed product descriptions, and 360-degree product views or product videos can give consumers a clearer sense of what they are buying. This helps customers feel more confident in their selections, reducing the need for returns.
7. Improving workforce management with AI
Another broad global ecommerce trend is where AI is increasingly being used to optimize workforce efficiency and logistics. In fact, 41% of retailers aim to improve workforce management using AI in 2024.
Labor shortages are a global issue exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and other demographic trends, such as aging populations and declining birth rates in many regions. Retailers face challenges in recruiting, retaining, and managing their workforce, particularly in ecommerce operations requiring efficient logistics, order fulfillment, and customer service handling.
AI offers a solution by automating repetitive tasks, improving hiring processes, and optimizing workforce deployment. For example, AI-driven recruitment tools can analyze vast amounts of data to identify candidates with the right skills, while AI-powered scheduling systems can ensure that the right number of workers are available during peak demand periods. This allows retailers to optimize labor costs, reduce the risk of understaffing, and improve overall operational efficiency.
AI also allows retailers to scale their operations more effectively by providing real-time insights into workforce productivity, logistics performance, and customer demand across regions. For example, AI can analyze regional labor markets to predict where staffing shortages might occur and recommend strategies for mitigating those shortages.
As ecommerce continues to expand globally, AI offers a scalable solution that allows retailers to adapt to regional differences, predict demand fluctuations, and manage their workforce more effectively.
8. Growing sales in China and APAC
The ecommerce landscape in China and the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region has continued to evolve with significant growth in 2024 and projections for 2025.
Despite a tepid start in the first half of 2023, China’s retail sector is rebounding, with retail sales growth showing signs of life as the year progresses.
The ecommerce market in China remains a global leader, with projected growth continuing in 2024 and beyond. As of 2024, the market is estimated to be worth $1.43 trillion, with a forecast to reach $2.31 trillion by 2029, growing at a CAGR of 10.07%. Several key factors drive this growth, including widespread smartphone adoption, mobile commerce (m-commerce), and the rise of digital payment solutions such as Alipay and WeChat Pay.
The Asia-Pacific (APAC) ecommerce market is poised for significant growth, with an estimated market size of $4.2 trillion in 2024, expected to reach $6.76 trillion by 2029, growing at a CAGR of 10%. This growth is driven by increasing internet penetration, consumer shift toward online shopping, and the convenience of ecommerce platforms.
Top countries contributing to this growth include:
China: The largest market, with dominant players like Alibaba and JD.com.
India: Fast growing due to rising internet use and fashion ecommerce.
Japan: Strong in technology and consumer electronics.
South Korea: Leading in mobile commerce, boosted by 5G technology.
Key industries driving ecommerce include fashion, electronics, and food delivery services, with a rising trend in omnichannel and mobile shopping experiences.
India’s ecommerce market is also experiencing robust growth, with projections indicating that the market size will reach $111 billion by 2024 and continue to expand to $200 billion by 2026. The country’s online retail market was valued at 4,822.8 billion Indian rupees in 2023 and is anticipated to reach 15,159.11 billion rupees by 2028.
To adapt to these changes, companies in the APAC region are diversifying their supplier base, with 79% of companies broadening their networks. Additionally, 71% are investing in regionalization and localization, and 83% are actively investing in friend-shoring with political and economic allies to reduce risk exposure.
Set up your international ecommerce strategy
Setting up an international, omnichannel ecommerce strategy can seem intimidating, but there are a few key areas that, if you address them as a priority, can help you succeed.
The areas for ecommerce businesses to focus on are:
Pricing
When it comes to pricing, two issues present themselves for international ecommerce retailers: currency conversion and how to handle promotions. Regarding the former, it’s worth researching how customers perceive pricing in the country you’re targeting. In the West, it’s common for prices to end in a 9, whereas in countries like China, it’s best to use a round number.
Businesses should use a wider range of factors to determine price sensitivity (especially in foreign markets) regarding promotions. In addition, effectively and profitably linking pricing and promotions together can increase revenue and profiles by three to five percentage points overall.
Payments
Thankfully—thinking about what payment methods are relatively simple for international ecommerce—you’ll need at least a debit/credit card processor and mobile wallet options, like Apple Pay and Google Pay, as well as a buy now, pay later (BNPL) option.
Some ecommerce platforms and global marketplaces have their own payment setup. For example, with Shopify Payments, you can set up all major payment methods for your ecommerce store automatically.
Customer service
Customer service is important no matter where in the world you’re serving. In most countries, common types of communication for customer service include phone, email, and live chat.
Shipping and logistics
How your buyers will receive your products is a huge factor to consider, as shipping likely will be expensive. So to make shipping internationally successful, think about removing as much friction as possible. That includes researching price options with carriers, offering shipping speed estimates, researching relevant taxes, and simply preventing some products from being sold in certain countries.
