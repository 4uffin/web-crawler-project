4 elements of great ecommerce website design
Building trust with customers
Creating a visually compelling experience
Focusing on responsive design across devices
Designing clear site navigation
The best ecommerce websites all have one thing in common: they center the user experience from first visit to post-checkout. There are four components every ecommerce business should consider when designing a website.
1. Building trust with customers
When someone visits your ecommerce store or website for the first time, they may not know anything about your brand, the quality of your products, or your commitment to making customers happy. Deals might earn their consideration, but they'll need to trust you before they actually go through with a purchase.
Customer trust is hardest to earn when you don't have any customers, so you'll want to incorporate the following trust indicators as you build your website.
Contact information
Include an email and, if possible, a phone number and a mailing address on a contact page and in the footer of your site. This type of information, along with an about page, helps potential customers feel they're buying from a real person.
A return policy
A return policy not only makes it easier for people to send back products that don't satisfy them, it actually increases sales by lowering shopping cart abandonment and instilling the customer with a sense of confidence and trust that they can send back an item if they need to, without any transaction fees.
Not only does Supergoop have a comprehensive returns page and self-directed returns portal, it also boasts its free returns policy on every product page.
Technical certifications
By adding Shopify Payments to your ecommerce website, you'll have access to advanced features and payment services featuring the latest security technology for protecting your customers' information. Add graphics or badges to show your security compliance and all the payment methods you accept.
Customer reviews and testimonials
Many ecommerce solutions have app integrations that let you import content into your site. This includes customer photos, your Instagram feed, and even customer reviews. These are signals to potential customers that your brand is trustworthy.
2. Creating a visually compelling experience
Perception is everything when selling your products online. People form their first impression of your ecommerce store in mere milliseconds. Making that impression count rests largely on high-quality images, consistent branding design, smart use of psychological design, and a clear visual hierarchy.
Build an online store with AI
Create a website in minutes with the AI store builder. Describe your brand or products to generate a free custom theme that fits your idea.

Here are some best practices for each of these elements:
Photography: Product photography is like an ambassador, sharing the promise of your product online. Shoot product photos on a plain background and in many angles. Lifestyle photos are important to show your product in use and in context within an environment. They also reinforce a brand aesthetic.
Color: Color is one of the most powerful tools you can use to spark interest and emotion on your ecommerce site. It can also be used to draw attention to specific sections of your website and lead the customer journey. Smart use of color can help with accessibility, too.
Fonts: While the words you write on your ecommerce site share information, it's the typography that communicates the emotion behind that information. It's a good idea to stick to two fonts and create a hierarchy between them. Choose one font as your header or title font and another to be your body font.
Psychological design and visual hierarchy: Using psychological design principles allows you to influence customers' decisions and guide their eyes with strategically placed elements, colors, and text.
Outdoor Voices' homepage features lifestyle images to communicate its brand aesthetic and an aspirational lifestyle. It focuses on limited fonts for a clean look and a clear visual hierarchy.
3. Focusing on responsive design across devices
The average American spends 5 hours and 16 minutes on a mobile phone each day. Luckily, if you're building your business with Shopify, your store is already responsive. This means the site is user friendly on different devices and screen sizes, whether customers view it on a desktop, smartphone, or tablet.
When choosing an ecommerce website design based on mobile optimization, it's best to personally test it to see if you're happy with the transactional flow. If you're not, there's a good chance your customers won't be either.
4. Designing clear site navigation
Your website navigation should help customers find your products quickly and easily. Good navigation also helps improve SEO on your site so you get found in search results.
Stick to only a few menu headers in your top-level navigation. Be clear and direct when labeling these headers—this is no time to be clever. Key headers to include in your top-level navigation could include:
Shop
About Us
Bestsellers
Contact Us
Additional navigation links can go in your footer—the section at the bottom of your website. Return Policy, Terms of Service, and Contact Us pages can be linked here.

9. Topo Designs
Outerwear shop Topo Designs uses images that resonate with its target market—young and stylish outdoor enthusiasts—while using unique backgrounds to stand out from other outerwear brands. Another key website design best practice is how the brand communicates sales and incentivizes larger order values with free shipping over a threshold. The brand also offers a newsletter signup perk of a 15% discount, compelling customers to take action.
10. KETNIPZ
Ketnipz is an Instagram comic turned brand empire created by Harry Hambley.

14. Satya Organic
You can tell branding was a priority in skin care brand Satya Organic's ecommerce website design. Once you land on the homepage, you're met with earthy tones and signals that say, "If you're looking for plant-based goods, you're in the right place." The footer of the website clearly lists the products' benefits and certifications like USDA Organic, cruelty-free, fragrance-free, and Indigenous-owned.;
15. Beardbrand
Beardbrand takes a sophisticated, mature, and Old World approach to presenting its grooming products throughout its website design. Using a quiz, video of the founder, and blog posts that are worth reading, the site encourages you to stick around, engage with the brand, and buy.
16. Kylie Cosmetics
As soon as you land on the Kylie Cosmetics homepage, you see a picture of Kylie Jenner, a beauty icon for its target audience. Her endorsement immediately gives the site a huge trust and credibility boost. Each product is also well displayed on a white background, plus, when you hover over an image, you can see a person using the product in action.
17. Allbirds
Sustainable apparel store Allbirds reinforces itself as a brand eco-conscious shoppers can trust through the targeted language in its copy, such as "Made with natural materials." Trust is also achieved through its B Corporation certification and a full section of the site dedicated to sustainability and transparency.

Certifications and press endorsements add to this sense of security.
19. Tessemae's
Tessemae's uses fan photos on its ecommerce site—user-generated content to help build trust. It tells visitors that Tessemae's products are well loved among existing customers. Plus, the brand provides inspiration for the many ways its dressings and condiments can be used to create delicious meals, adding an extra incentive to buy.
20. Death Wish Coffee
Death Wish Coffee has a really bold brand and it's not afraid to express it in its storefront. It claims to sell "the world's strongest coffee," and everything from the website copy to the use of red throughout its website design makes you feel like you just drank a cup of it. Death Wish Coffee knows why most people land on its site: to buy its beans. Once you scroll down the homepage, the first thing you see is the option to buy ground or whole beans, or coffee cups.
21. Almond Surfboards
Almond Surfboards uses soft elegant tones throughout its online store to give it a stylish but beachy feel. The imagery is creative and unique, which makes it feel like a high-quality brand from the minute you land on the page. In-context photography sells an aspirational lifestyle—even if you don't need a surfboard, you might be compelled to own a piece of the brand through t-shirts, accessories, wall art, and more.
22. Leather Head
Leather Head's homepage layout is simple and matches the brand feel of refinement and luxury. The choice of color, font, product images, and copy voice and tone reflect the brand aesthetic that appeals to its target customer. Even if you're not into sports, you'll definitely want to browse and find a product for a friend or loved one who is.
23. Pura Vida Bracelets
To foster trust, jewelry retailer Pura Vida Bracelets showcases five-star product reviews from thousands of customers on its ecommerce website landing page, on top of reviews from target-audience-appropriate media outlets like BuzzFeed and HuffPost.

24. Boba Love
Boba Love is a small business with ecommerce design that guides visitors right into the shopping experience. It uses lifestyle images and product photography to communicate its brand values. Boba Love gets the product grid right—it's clean and clear in directing what it wants visitors to do: buy Boba tea-inspired products.

8 best ecommerce website design tips
While you'll want to design your online store based on your established brand guidelines, there are a few best practices to consider to improve usability and customer experience. Your ecommerce site is the résumé for your online business. Whether you're a startup or building your fifth ecommerce store, keep these website design tips in mind:
1. Keep it simple
Simple is always key to making more sales in your ecommerce business. The more distractions you put on your ecommerce website (think banner ads, pop-ups, too many colors), the more it takes away from making the sale. A good ecommerce platform will have a number of ecommerce website templates to choose from to help you keep your design streamlined.
2. Express your brand
It doesn't matter if you're a photographer, beautician, or dropshipper running an online business. People want to buy from established brands they trust and identify with. Take the time to define your brand and figure out what makes you different from competitors—then apply it to your web design.
3. Use the right platform
Use the best ecommerce platform for your online store. When using a platform like Shopify, you can set up a beautiful store with powerful ecommerce features and sell online quickly. A great ecommerce platform should be flexible and easy to use, allowing you to customize your ecommerce website to your exact needs. You can use Shopify's website builder, which offers AI functionality to create your own store from scratch.
4. Have empathy
Put yourself in your potential customers' shoes. How easy is it to navigate your ecommerce website? How does it make someone feel when shopping? How easy is the checkout process? Think about what your customer needs to make a purchase in your store and design it accordingly.
5. Upload high quality images
Images can improve a website's conversion rate by 40%. But they have to be high-quality. Invest in good product photos and use images from free stock photo websites to help increase the visual appeal throughout the shopping experience.
6. Lead with professionalism
Want to start an online store that builds trust with shoppers? You need a professional website. Customers won't give you their hard-earned money or sensitive information like credit card numbers if it's anything less.
7. Leverage social proof
When designing your ecommerce site, look for places to show social proof like positive reviews and user-generated content. The more shoppers see the good experiences other people have had with your products, the more likely they'll be to buy.
8. Focus on checkout
Even if you have a beautiful, innovative ecommerce website design, if checkout is a pain, customers may not buy from you. Make checkout for your ecommerce business simple, straightforward, and fast. Use payment gateways like Shop Pay, Amazon Pay, PayPal, Stripe, and other accelerated payment options to make it as easy as possible for shoppers to buy.
Start accepting payments fast with Shopify Payments
Skip lengthy third-party activations and go from setup to selling in one click. Shopify Payments comes with your Shopify plan, all you need to do is turn it on.
