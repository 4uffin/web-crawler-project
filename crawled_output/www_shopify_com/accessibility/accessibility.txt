Ongoing Efforts to Ensure Accessible ContentShopify uses the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) version 2.2 as its guiding principle. As we create new products, the principles of accessible design and development are an integral part of conception and realization.We continually test content and features for WCAG 2.2 Level AA compliance and do our best to remediate any issues and meet or exceed the standards. Our accessibility experts test our digital content and products with a variety of tools including automated testing software, screen readers, voice dictation, screen magnification, color contrast analyzers, keyboard-only navigation techniques, and a variety of bookmarklets. We also work with people with disabilities to complete usability tests during product creation, all in an effort to build accessible products.While merchants have complete control over their theme codes, we offer developer training resources on how to build accessible components for our Shopify ecosystem, including merchants and partners.Product VPATsShopify accessibility conformance reports are available below. Each follows the Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT), WCAG Edition.
