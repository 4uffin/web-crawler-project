Eligibility is automatically determined by our underwriting model, which uses machine learning to analyze data relating to your business, including your sales, disputes, and customer engagement. You must also meet minimum requirements, such as:Sell on Shopify for at least 90 daysComply with Shopify’s Acceptable Use Policy and Terms of ServiceWe will send you an email if you're eligible to apply for funding. Additionally, when you log in to your account, a message will appear on the admin Home inviting you to view available funding offers.How does underwriting work?Underwriting has two stages. In the first stage, Shopify Capital’s underwriting model identifies if your business may be eligible to prequalify for funding. In the second stage, the Shopify Capital team reviews your application to determine if you qualify for the requested funding amount.What must I provide to apply?You’ll need basic information about your business and yourself, as the authorized representative responsible for the Shopify account. This usually includes an employment identification number (or other business identifier), contact details, birth dates, addresses, and social security numbers of primary owners and management. This information will not be used for a credit check.Can I get more than one round of funding?Funding offers through Capital are provided under separate funding agreements. You may be eligible for additional funding once you've paid a certain percentage of your current funding round.How do I make payments?You’ll automatically repay with a fixed percentage of your store’s daily sales, but only on days you make sales. This means you’ll pay more when sales are strong and less when they’re slow, which makes it easier to manage your cash flow.Available in select countries. All loans through Shopify Capital are issued by WebBank in the United States. Offers to apply do not guarantee funding. Shopify Capital loans are repaid based on a percentage of daily sales. The maximum repayment term is 18 months, and 2 minimum payments apply. The actual time period within which the loan is repaid may be less than 18 months.1.Amounts presented are in USD.
