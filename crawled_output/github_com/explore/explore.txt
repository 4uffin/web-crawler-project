For the Love of Code
A joyful summer hackathon for weird, wonderful, and wildly creative code
For the Love of Code is a global summer-long hackathon celebrating joyful, ridiculous, and wildly creative coding projects. Whether youâ€™re building a bot that reviews your PRs like a concerned parent, finally doing something with that domain name you bought at 2AM, or inventing a programming language where every keyword is an emojiâ€”this is your excuse to build the thing.
No startup pitches. No pressure. Just vibes.
Enter solo or with friends, and submit your project by September 22. Winners get Copilot Pro+, eternal nerd cred, and a feature on the GitHub blog.
Join in on the fun.

AI orchestration framework to build customizable, production-ready LLM applications. Connect components (models, vector DBs, file converters) to pipelines or agents that can interact with your data. With advanced retrieval methods, it's best suited for building RAG, question answering, semantic search or conversational agent chatbots.

Depfu
Depfu is the best way for busy teams to keep their app dependencies up-to-date. We believe doing small, easy to assess updates regularly and supported by automation is a lot easier than falling behind and having to update everything at once.
We support all Ruby projects using Bundler, all JS projects using npm or Yarn, all Elixir projects using Hex and all PHP projects using Composer. Lock files are handled automatically.
