Issue-Label Bot
Issue Label Bot automatically labels issues as either a feature request, bug or question, using machine learning. You can alias these labels so that the labels are personalized for your repo (for example if you prefer enhancement vs. feature_request).
Instructions on how to alias the labels can be viewed on the app's website.
This app only works on public repositories.
