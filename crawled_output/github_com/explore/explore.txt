Recurse ML
What is Recurse?
Recurse build machine learning models that find bugs in code. This can be in the code that humans write, or that AI generates. We have built two tools for each use case.
rml CLI tool
rml checks locally staged changes for bugs. It integrates with AI agents like Cursor and Claude Code acting as a self-healing feedback loop for them to fix their mistakes.
GitHub App
It automatically reviews pull requests for breaking changes when submitted to your codebase.
