What we're covering
• DC reels from Kirk killing: The impact of Charlie Kirk’s assassination is being felt throughout Washington, from scrutiny over President Donald Trump’s rhetoric and the FBI director to renewed efforts to better protect lawmakers.
• Investigation updates: The roommate of Tyler Robinson, Kirk’s alleged shooter, was a romantic partner of Robinson and was transitioning from male to female, the Utah governor said Sunday. Investigators are looking into whether it was a factor in the assassination, and into a note left by Robinson.
• Crime crackdown: Meanwhile, Trump has pushed ahead with his federal law enforcement crackdown in Democratic-led cities, though he shifted focus last week from Chicago to Memphis in part to avoid legal headaches, sources told CNN.
• Foreign policy: The president enters a key week on the global stage, with his state visit to the United Kingdom coming at a critical time for US-European relations, and as efforts stall to end wars in the Middle East and Ukraine.

Authorities investigate motive of alleged shooter of Charlie Kirk. Here’s the latest

Authorities are continuing to investigate the motives of the alleged shooter following the killing of conservative political activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University last week.
If you’re just joining our coverage, here are the latest developments we’re reporting today:
Suspect in custody: Tyler Robinson, who is accused of killing Kirk, is being held in a special housing unit at the Utah County Jail pending a mental health evaluation, the Utah County Sheriff’s Office told CNN. The 22-year-old is set to appear in court on Tuesday and is being held without bail on charges of aggravated murder, felony discharge of a firearm and obstruction of justice.
Utah governor on shooting motives: Utah Gov. Spencer Cox spoke with several news outlets, including CNN, today about the potential motives and radicalization of the alleged shooter. Cox pointed to gaming and “dark internet” culture as potential factors that contributed to a shift, and said Robinson is not cooperating with authorities.
Note left by alleged shooter: Investigators are looking into a note left by Robinson, but Cox declined to share the specifics.
Robinson’s roommate: Authorities are now looking into whether Robinson’s relationship with his roommate, who is transitioning from male to female, may be tied to a potential motive in the shooting. Cox told CNN’s Dana Bash that it’s “easy to draw conclusions” but declined to speculate. He said the roommate “has been incredibly cooperative” and “had no idea that this was happening.”
Governor’s conversation with Trump: Cox, a Republican, shared details about his conversation with President Donald Trump following the killing of Kirk. He said the president is “very angry” but talked about “nonviolence.”
Fans mourn Kirk: Vigils are taking place across the country to pay tribute to Kirk. The Kennedy Center in Washington, DC, is set to host a vigil tonight, while a massive memorial is scheduled for September 21 at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.

Alleged Kirk shooter placed under special watch pending mental health evaluation
From CNN's Alaa Elassar
Tyler Robinson, the suspect in custody for the assassination of Charlie Kirk, is being held in a special housing unit at the Utah County Jail so staff can “keep a close eye on him,” the Utah County Sheriff’s Office confirmed to CNN in a statement.
Robinson is under enhanced supervision and will remain on special watch pending a mental health evaluation, a process that may take several days, according to Sgt. Ray Ormond.
“After cleared by mental health, he will proceed through our classification process to determine the appropriate housing area,” Ormond said. “He will continue to be monitored by mental, medical, and custody staff throughout the duration of his stay.”
Ormond stated the precautionary measures are standard for cases involving serious charges or potential behavioral concerns. While Ormond said he hasn’t been made aware of any specific suicidal comments from Robinson, the suspect will continue to be monitored by medical, mental health and custody staff throughout his stay.

Speaker Johnson "trying to calm the nerves" about security after Kirk shooting

Speaker Mike Johnson said he’s been working to reassure House members about their personal security in the days following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.
“I’ve been talking with a lot of them over the last few days about that and trying to calm the nerves to assure them that we will make certain that everyone has a level of security that’s necessary,” he said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.”
Johnson said leadership is looking at “all the options” to bolster member security and urged lawmakers to “turn down the rhetoric,” saying allegations that Republicans are “fascists” is “not helpful.”
“There are some deranged people in society, and when they see leaders using that kind of language so often now, increasingly, it spurs them on to action,” he said, adding that he’s “heartened” to see “many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle are stepping up and saying that.”
Johnson said he will participate in a vigil for Kirk on Sunday evening at the Kennedy Center. He also said he would lead a moment of prayer for lawmakers when the House returns on Monday evening.

Utah Sen. Curtis challenges partisan labels for radicalization

Republican Utah Sen. John Curtis took aim at partisan labels for the word “radical” after the shooting of conservative political activist Charlie Kirk in his home state.
“I think you need to take the word radical and remove ‘right’ or ‘left.’ Radical coming from any direction is not good, it’s not healthy and it should be called out,” Curtis said on Sunday on ABC’s “This Week.”
The Utah Senator honed in on social media’s impact, saying there is often “zero liability for what people are putting out there.”
“It (social media) can be positive, but I fear in many cases, it’s a huge weight and a very negative weight on this generation.”
Curtis also noted the strength of Kirk’s organization Turning Point USA but said Kirk himself is “not replaceable.”
“I have no doubt those shoes will be filled, never quite the same way, but they will be filled,” Curtis said, acknowledging the group’s leadership vacuum in the wake of the shooting.

Noem says Trump is “grateful” for Memphis leaders on National Guard deployment plans
By CNN's Alejandra Jaramillo
Mayor Paul Young said he was blindsided by the decision and does not support the deployment.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Sunday that President Donald Trump is “grateful” for the cooperation of local leaders in Memphis as the administration prepares to deploy the National Guard to address violent crime in the city when Mayor Paul Young seemed to suggest otherwise.
“Well, the president will be working with the local mayor and the governor in Tennessee to make sure that operations are streamlined and that we’re effective, and that we’re going after the worst of the worst, those criminals that are there, getting them off the streets and making it safer,” Noem said in an interview with “Sunday Morning Futures” on Fox News with host Maria Bartiromo.
“So it’s good to have local leaders that understand the importance of the work that this president is doing,” she continued.
“The president is very engaged on this issue. He’s grateful for the partnership of those local leaders, and we’re looking forward to making a big difference there for the people that are in Tennessee.”
However, Young offered a starkly different account in an interview with CNN a day earlier, saying he was blindsided by the decision and does not support the deployment.
“I’m certainly not happy,” Young told CNN, referring to the deployment of federal troops. He said he only received definitive confirmation of the decision when Trump publicly discussed it on national television.
On Friday, during an appearance on “Fox & Friends,” Trump said he was sending National Guard troops to Memphis to combat the city’s high crime rates, calling it a “deeply troubled” place.
“The deployment may go beyond the National Guard and could include the Army if needed,” Trump said.

Colorado governor says individuals, "not the free speech," to blame for shootings

After shootings rocked the country this week, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis pushed back on Utah Gov. Spencer Cox’s characterization of social media as a “cancer,” and placed the blame on the perpetrators, saying “the responsibility lies firmly with them.”
“What I would focus on is condemning the act of violence. It’s not the free speech that led to this. It’s not the fact that people can talk and communicate online. It’s the actions of an unhinged, evil individual that caused this horrible, horrific assassination,” Polis said on ABC’s “This Week,” referencing the killing of conservative political activist Charlie Kirk.
The Colorado governor also prayed for the recovery of two students who were injured in a shooting at Evergreen High School in the Denver area. Polis acknowledged that the shooter was radicalized by online content, but the Democratic governor did not blame the shooting on the gunman’s access to media.
“Many people play video games, many people are online, many people watch movies, and many of them are perfectly peaceful Americans who contribute to making our country safer and a better place,” Polis said.

DHS Secretary Noem says Charlie Kirk’s assassination marks a global turning point
By CNN's Alejandra Jaramillo
“It feels like a grief has settled on not just the country, but the entire world, something has changed," said Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.
Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images
Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem described the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk as a defining moment not only for the United States but for the world and discussed one of their final exchanges about violent crime and government accountability.
“In fact, the last thing Charlie had texted me about a day or two before he passed away, was about those mayors and governors,” Noem told Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo” on Sunday. She was referring to ongoing discussions about President Donald Trump’s crackdown on crime and his push to deploy the National Guard to Democratic-led states, as he did in Washington, DC.
“He wanted them to be held accountable for how dangerous they were making the situation for their people to have to live in those cities,” Noem added.
When asked why Kirk’s assassination marked a national turning point, the DHS secretary emphasized its broader impact.
“It feels like a grief has settled on not just the country, but the entire world, something has changed.”
Noem also echoed the administration’s criticism of left-wing political rhetoric in the wake of the killing.
“Some of the rhetoric we’re seeing out of the left and out of political animals is ugly and it’s bitter and it’s seeking to seize this opportunity to turn it into evil. And I would just encourage everybody to start focusing on relationships, start focusing on each other and talk about what Charlie believed in.”

Cox signals "dark internet" culture contributed to alleged shooter's radicalization
From CNN's Betsy Klein
Utah Gov. Spencer Cox further elaborated on how investigators have determined that Tyler Robinson, the alleged shooter of Charlie Kirk, had been radicalized, pointing to gaming and “dark internet” culture as potential factors that contributed to a shift.
Cox on CNN’s “State of the Union” Sunday gave more details about his comment to the Wall Street Journal last week that Robinson had been “deeply indoctrinated with leftist ideology,” suggesting that came from conversations Robinson had with friends.
In an interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press” with Kristen Welker, Cox added, “According to family and people that we’re interviewing, he does come from a conservative family but his ideology was very different from his family and so that’s part of it.”
Robinson, Cox said, is not cooperating with authorities, but they have been able to glean significant information from family, friends, and acquaintances.
Cox suggested things changed for Robinson after he dropped out of Utah State University.
“It seemed to happen kind of after that — after he moved back to the southern part of Utah. Clearly, there was a lot of gaming going on, friends that have confirmed that there was kind of that deep, dark internet, Reddit culture and these other dark places of the internet where this person was going deep. You saw that on the casings. … the meme-ification that is happening in our society today,” he told NBC.
In an interview with ABC’s “This Week” with Martha Raddatz, Cox also confirmed reports that acquaintances were joking online with Robinson about photos released by the FBI during the manhunt.
“Those conversations definitely were happening. And they did not believe it was actually him — it was all joking until he admitted that it actually was him,” he said.
Cox, who appeared on a trio of Sunday shows to offer some new details about the investigation, said the White House asked him to.
“I don’t do a lot of national media anymore and it was the encouragement of the White House that I’m on this program this morning,” he told Raddatz.

Sen. Mark Kelly calls on leaders to choose their words wisely: “people are listening”
From CNN's Aileen Graef

Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly, the husband of former Democratic Rep. Gabby Giffords, who was shot at an event in 2011, called political violence “a pervasive issue in our country” and cautioned against placing blame with one side.
“Whether you’re a governor or senator, a member of the House, president of the United States, you have to be very careful about your words because people are listening,” Kelly said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday.
Kelly also criticized social media companies for “exploiting kids” and called for congressional action.
Kelly said his wife, who has been focused on curbing gun violence in the US since she was shot, was particularly affected by Charlie Kirk’s assassination.
“I would say this one in particular hit her pretty hard, and it’s because she saw the video. You know, the video is all over social media. It’s kind of hard to avoid, and you can just kind of stumble right into it,” Kelly said. “I hope some of these social media companies can scrub this off the internet, because it’s not good for kids to see this.”

Utah Gov. Cox: "We actually should disagree"

Utah Gov. Spencer Cox has made it a personal campaign to turn down the nation’s political temperature and “disagree better” in the wake of Charlie Kirk’s murder.
But Trump ally Steve Bannon, meanwhile, has attacked Cox as a “national embarrassment.”
“Mr. Bannon is angry, and rightfully so. And I’m not saying we have to just sing Kumbaya and hold hands. What I’m saying is we actually should disagree. I think Charlie represented that better than anyone. Charlie said some very inflammatory things, and in some corners of the web, that’s all people have heard. But he also said some other things about forgiveness,” Cox told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union.”
He continued, “There are conflict entrepreneurs out there who benefit from radicalizing us. And I’m not one of those. I don’t know that that’s particularly helpful.”
Cox called for the removal of cell phones in classroom and efforts to hold social media companies to account.
He described the Kirk killing as a “direct assault on America” and called on Americans to “look in the mirror and decide, are we going to try to make it better, or are we going to make it worse?”

Utah Gov. Spencer Cox had previously indicated that shooting suspect Tyler Robinson had discussed Charlie Kirk with his family. Asked on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday for more specifics, Cox said that Robinson was “just not a fan,” and declined to elaborate further.
Cox spoke by phone with President Donald Trump after his remarks at a press conference on Friday, he said, describing the call as a “long conversation” and “very sobering.”
According to Atlantic reporter McKay Coppins, Trump told Cox, “The type of person who would do something like that to Charlie Kirk would love to do it to us.”
Asked for his response, Cox told CNN’s Dana Bash, “He’s not wrong. I mean, he knows better than anyone as someone who literally was injured by a bullet, I mean, a fraction of an inch away from being killed a year ago. He understands that better than anyone.”
He said he was “grateful” that the president has talked about “nonviolence.”
Trump, Cox added, is “also very angry.”
“I get that. This is his close personal friend, and anger is a normal reaction,” he said.

Investigators looking into note left by alleged Kirk shooter
From CNN's Betsy Klein
Investigators are looking into a note left by Tyler Robinson, the alleged shooter of Charlie Kirk, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said Sunday.
Social and gaming platform Discord vice president Jud Hoffman said in a statement Friday that there were “communications between the suspect’s roommate and a friend after the shooting where the roommate was recounting the contents of a note the suspect had left elsewhere.”
Cox appeared to confirm the existence of a note in an interview with CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union,” but indicated it was still under review.
“Those are things that are still being processed for accuracy and verification and will be included in charging documents,” Cox said.
Pressed by Bash on whether a note was found and its contents were known by law enforcement, he declined to share specifics.

Investigators looking into whether alleged Kirk shooter's romantic relationship with transitioning roommate was a factor in shooting, Utah Gov. says

The roommate of Tyler Robinson, Charlie Kirk’s alleged shooter, was a romantic partner of Robinson and transitioning from male to female, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said Sunday. Investigators are looking into whether that was a factor in last week’s assassination.
“Yes. I can confirm that. I know that has been reported, and that the FBI has confirmed that as well – that the roommate was a romantic partner, a male transitioning to female,” Cox said in an interview with CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union.”
The roommate, Cox added, “has been incredibly cooperative, had no idea that this was happening, and is working with investigators right now.”
Asked by Bash whether the roommate’s status was relevant to the investigation and a potential motive, Cox said it was “easy to draw conclusions” but declined to speculate.
“I know everybody wants to know exactly why, and point the finger. And I totally get that. I do too, and so I just want to be careful, as I haven’t read all of the interview transcripts, and so we’ll have to wait and see what comes out,” he said.
Cox was asked about previous comments that Robinson had been indoctrinated with “leftist ideology.” He said that information “comes from the people around him, from his family members and his friends.”
Official charges, Cox said, will be filed on Tuesday.

Trump issues an ultimatum for NATO countries on Russia sanctions

President Donald Trump issued an ultimatum yesterday to NATO allies in a letter, saying that the US will issue “major” sanctions on Russia only when NATO countries agree to do the same and stop buying oil from Russia.
Trump’s demands would mark a major shift in policies among the alliance, and there are major questions as to whether there could be collective interest in taking these steps.
“I am ready to do major Sanctions on Russia when all NATO Nations have agreed, and started, to do the same thing, and when all NATO Nations STOP BUYING OIL FROM RUSSIA,” he said in a post to social media, quoting what he said was a letter sent to his NATO counterparts.
He continued, “As you know, NATO’S commitment to WIN has been far less than 100%, and the purchase of Russian Oil, by some, has been shocking! It greatly weakens your negotiating position, and bargaining power, over Russia. Anyway, I am ready to ‘go’ when you are. Just say when?”
The president also called on NATO countries to significantly ramp up tariffs on China in a show of force.
“I believe that this, plus NATO, as a group, placing 50% to 100% TARIFFS ON CHINA, to be fully withdrawn after the WAR with Russia and Ukraine is ended, will also be of great help in ENDING this deadly, but RIDICULOUS, WAR,” he said.
Trump added that Russia’s war in Ukraine would end “quickly” if those steps are taken.
CNN has previously reported that the European Union imposed a ban on maritime Russian oil imports and refined oil products like diesel, but many countries continue to import Russian fossil fuels and liquefied natural gas.

What to know about Trump's law enforcement crackdown in Memphis
From CNN's Donald Judd, Betsy Klein, Chris Isidore, Marshall Cohen, Wesley Bruer and Jason Morris
President Donald Trump announced Friday that his administration would target Memphis as part of his efforts to crack down on crime in major US cities.
Calling the city “deeply troubled,” Trump suggested the mayor and Tennessee governor were happy with the action, which could include the “National Guard and anybody else we need.”

City leaders push back: But Memphis Mayor Paul Young said at a Friday afternoon news conference that it was not done at his request, asserting that he learned in the morning “that the President and Governor are looking to bring Federal resources to our city which include the National Guard, which they have the authority to do.”
“I want to be clear I did not ask for the National Guard and I don’t think it is the way to drive down crime,” he said. “However, that decision has already been made.”
Yesterday, Young told CNN’s Victor Blackwell that he didn’t have official confirmation until Trump announced it Friday during an interview with Fox News, but he “learned earlier this week that it was under consideration.”
Pivot from Chicago: Trump had previously threatened — using incendiary rhetoric — to send troops to address crime in Chicago. But while the Department of Homeland Security has announced an immigration crackdown there, troops have not been mobilized.
The president shelved his plan for Chicago after advisers warned him it could create legal headaches without buy-in from the state’s governor, sources familiar with the matter told CNN.
While Memphis is a Democratic city, Tennessee’s Republican governor appears more willing to accept federal intervention than Illinois’ Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker, who has been in a war of words with Trump.

Analysis: Trump and Utah's governor offer contrasting rhetoric on Kirk's killing
Analysis from CNN's Aaron Blake
Utah Governor Spencer Cox speaks during a press conference on September 12.
Cheney Orr/Reuters
For the approximately 40 hours between the assassination of Charlie Kirk and the announcement Friday that a suspect was apprehended, finger-pointing reigned on the right.
Some Republicans and right-wing pundits and influencers spoke of “war” and their side becoming radicalized in response. President Donald Trump, who’d floated cracking down on leftists and liberal organizations he baselessly blamed for political violence, topped it off Friday morning by suggesting conservative extremists have been radicalized for legitimate reasons, while saying “radicals on the left are the problem.”
At a time when politicians and presidents usually call for calm and unity, his rhetoric was throwing fuel on the fire. And it wasn’t difficult to see how that could lead to even more ugly places.
But the tragedy in Utah also happens to have cast a spotlight on Utah Gov. Spencer Cox — a Republican who has spent years calling for quite the opposite approach: a more civil and less angry version of politics.
During two news conferences last week, Cox used his speaking time to project a far different message than that of Trump and leading MAGA figures.
He at one point explicitly decried the tendency to “point the finger at the other side,” something Trump and others have repeatedly done.
“We can return violence with violence. We can return hate with hate. And that’s the problem with political violence,” Cox said. “It metastasizes, because we can always point the finger at the other side. And at some point, we have to find an off-ramp, or it’s going to get much, much worse.”
