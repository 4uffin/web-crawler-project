What we're covering
• DC reels from Kirk killing: The impact of Charlie Kirk’s assassination is being felt throughout Washington, from scrutiny over President Donald Trump’s rhetoric and FBI director to renewed efforts to better protect lawmakers.
• Crime crackdown: Meanwhile, Trump has pushed ahead with his federal law enforcement crackdown in Democratic-led cities, though he shifted focus last week from Chicago to Memphis in part to avoid legal headaches from the resistant Illinois governor, sources told CNN. The administration’s sweeping deportation push also continues in Chicago and across the US.
• Foreign policy: The president enters a key week on the global stage, with his state visit to the United Kingdom coming at a critical time for US-European relations, and as efforts stall to end wars in the Middle East and Ukraine.

Utah Gov. Cox: "We actually should disagree"
From CNN's Betsy Klein
Utah Gov. Spencer Cox has made it a personal campaign to turn down the nation’s political temperature and “disagree better” in the wake of Charlie Kirk’s murder.
But Trump ally Steve Bannon, meanwhile, has attacked Cox as a “national embarrassment.”
“Mr. Bannon is angry, and rightfully so. And I’m not saying we have to just sing Kumbaya and hold hands. What I’m saying is we actually should disagree. I think Charlie represented that better than anyone. Charlie said some very inflammatory things, and in some corners of the web, that’s all people have heard. But he also said some other things about forgiveness,” Cox told Bash.
He continued, “There are conflict entrepreneurs out there who benefit from radicalizing us. And I’m not one of those. I don’t know that that’s particularly helpful.”
Cox called for the removal of cell phones in classroom and efforts to hold social media companies to account.
He described the Kirk killing as a “direct assault on America” and called on Americans to “look in the mirror and decide, are we going to try to make it better, or are we going to make it worse?”

Utah governor describes "very sobering" conversation with Trump after shooting
From CNN's Betsy Klein
Cox had previously indicated that Robinson had discussed Kirk with his family. Asked on CNN’s “State of the Union” Sunday for more specifics, Cox said that Robinson was “just not a fan,” and declined to elaborate further.
Cox spoke by phone with President Donald Trump after his remarks at a press conference on Friday, he said, describing the call as a “long conversation” and “very sobering.”
According to Atlantic reporter McKay Coppins, Trump told Cox, “The type of person who would do something like that to Charlie Kirk would love to do it to us.”
Asked for his response, Cox told Bash, “He’s not wrong. I mean, he knows better than anyone as someone who literally was injured by a bullet, I mean, a fraction of an inch away from being killed a year ago. He understands that better than anyone.”
He said he was “grateful” that the president has talked about “nonviolence.”
Trump, Cox added, is “also very angry.”
“I get that. This is his close personal friend, and anger is a normal reaction,” he said.

Investigators looking into note left by alleged Kirk shooter
From CNN's Betsy Klein
Investigators are looking into a note left by Tyler Robinson, the alleged shooter of Charlie Kirk, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said Sunday.
Social and gaming platform Discord vice president Jud Hoffman said in a statement Friday that there were “communications between the suspect’s roommate and a friend after the shooting where the roommate was recounting the contents of a note the suspect had left elsewhere.”
Cox appeared to confirm the existence of a note in an interview with CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union,” but indicated it was still under review.
“Those are things that are still being processed for accuracy and verification and will be included in charging documents,” Cox said.
Pressed by Bash on whether a note was found and its contents were known by law enforcement, he declined to share specifics.

Investigators looking into whether alleged Kirk shooter's romantic relationship with transitioning roommate was a factor in shooting, Utah Gov. says
From CNN's Betsy Klein
The roommate of Tyler Robinson, Charlie Kirk’s alleged shooter, was a romantic partner of Robinson and transitioning from male to female, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said Sunday. Investigators are looking into whether that was a factor in last week’s assassination.
“Yes. I can confirm that. I know that has been reported, and that the FBI has confirmed that as well – that the roommate was a romantic partner, a male transitioning to female,” Cox said in an interview with CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union.”
The roommate, Cox added, “has been incredibly cooperative, had no idea that this was happening, and is working with investigators right now.”
Asked by Bash whether the roommate’s status was relevant to the investigation and a potential motive, Cox said it was “easy to draw conclusions” but declined to speculate.
“I know everybody wants to know exactly why, and point the finger. And I totally get that. I do too, and so I just want to be careful, as I haven’t read all of the interview transcripts, and so we’ll have to wait and see what comes out,” he said.
Cox was asked about previous comments that Robinson had been indoctrinated with “leftist ideology.” He said that information “comes from the people around him, from his family members and his friends.”
Official charges, Cox said, will be filed on Tuesday.

Trump issues an ultimatum for NATO countries on Russia sanctions
From CNN’s Betsy Klein and Kevin Liptak

President Donald Trump issued an ultimatum yesterday to NATO allies in a letter, saying that the US will issue “major” sanctions on Russia only when NATO countries agree to do the same and stop buying oil from Russia.
Trump’s demands would mark a major shift in policies among the alliance, and there are major questions as to whether there could be collective interest in taking these steps.
“I am ready to do major Sanctions on Russia when all NATO Nations have agreed, and started, to do the same thing, and when all NATO Nations STOP BUYING OIL FROM RUSSIA,” he said in a post to social media, quoting what he said was a letter sent to his NATO counterparts.
He continued, “As you know, NATO’S commitment to WIN has been far less than 100%, and the purchase of Russian Oil, by some, has been shocking! It greatly weakens your negotiating position, and bargaining power, over Russia. Anyway, I am ready to ‘go’ when you are. Just say when?”
The president also called on NATO countries to significantly ramp up tariffs on China in a show of force.
“I believe that this, plus NATO, as a group, placing 50% to 100% TARIFFS ON CHINA, to be fully withdrawn after the WAR with Russia and Ukraine is ended, will also be of great help in ENDING this deadly, but RIDICULOUS, WAR,” he said.
Trump added that Russia’s war in Ukraine would end “quickly” if those steps are taken.
CNN has previously reported that the European Union imposed a ban on maritime Russian oil imports and refined oil products like diesel, but many countries continue to import Russian fossil fuels and liquefied natural gas.

What to know about Trump's law enforcement crackdown in Memphis
From CNN's Donald Judd, Betsy Klein, Chris Isidore, Marshall Cohen, Wesley Bruer and Jason Morris
President Donald Trump announced Friday that his administration would target Memphis as part of his efforts to crack down on crime in major US cities.
Calling the city “deeply troubled,” Trump suggested the mayor and Tennessee governor were happy with the action, which could include the “National Guard and anybody else we need.”

City leaders push back: But Memphis Mayor Paul Young said at a Friday afternoon news conference that it was not done at his request, asserting that he learned in the morning “that the President and Governor are looking to bring Federal resources to our city which include the National Guard, which they have the authority to do.”
“I want to be clear I did not ask for the National Guard and I don’t think it is the way to drive down crime,” he said. “However, that decision has already been made.”
Yesterday, Young told CNN’s Victor Blackwell that he didn’t have official confirmation until Trump announced it Friday during an interview with Fox News, but he “learned earlier this week that it was under consideration.”
Pivot from Chicago: Trump had previously threatened — using incendiary rhetoric — to send troops to address crime in Chicago. But while the Department of Homeland Security has announced an immigration crackdown there, troops have not been mobilized.
The president shelved his plan for Chicago after advisers warned him it could create legal headaches without buy-in from the state’s governor, sources familiar with the matter told CNN.
While Memphis is a Democratic city, Tennessee’s Republican governor appears more willing to accept federal intervention than Illinois’ Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker, who has been in a war of words with Trump.
CNN’s Michelle Watson contributed reporting to this post.

Analysis: Trump and Utah's governor offer contrasting rhetoric on Kirk's killing
Analysis from CNN's Aaron Blake
For the approximately 40 hours between the assassination of Charlie Kirk and the announcement Friday that a suspect was apprehended, finger-pointing reigned on the right.
Some Republicans and right-wing pundits and influencers spoke of “war” and their side becoming radicalized in response. President Donald Trump, who’d floated cracking down on leftists and liberal organizations he baselessly blamed for political violence, topped it off Friday morning by suggesting conservative extremists have been radicalized for legitimate reasons, while saying “radicals on the left are the problem.”
At a time when politicians and presidents usually call for calm and unity, his rhetoric was throwing fuel on the fire. And it wasn’t difficult to see how that could lead to even more ugly places.
But the tragedy in Utah also happens to have cast a spotlight on Utah Gov. Spencer Cox — a Republican who has spent years calling for quite the opposite approach: a more civil and less angry version of politics.
During two news conferences last week, Cox used his speaking time to project a far different message than that of Trump and leading MAGA figures.
He at one point explicitly decried the tendency to “point the finger at the other side,” something Trump and others have repeatedly done.
“We can return violence with violence. We can return hate with hate. And that’s the problem with political violence,” Cox said. “It metastasizes, because we can always point the finger at the other side. And at some point, we have to find an off-ramp, or it’s going to get much, much worse.”
