The article differs substantively from the actual conclusions of the study. This study shows a minor correlation in some bacterial DNA "signatures" in arterial plaque in about 200 people (~40% had the correlated bacteria). The study only included tissues from people who died of heart disease or had surgery related to heart disease. There does not currently appear to be a strong baseline about how widespread this bacterial signature may exist in a broad population regardless of health.In a nutshell there is a slightly interesting idea that deserves further study. That's it.replylithocarpus 6 hours ago

Interesting.So, one could make a similar article saying "Myocardial infarction may be caused by sugar consumption" and support it by analyzing the recent diet of 200 people who died of heart disease and finding that 95% of them recently consumed a lot of sugar.replyBigJono 4 hours ago
| root | parent | next [–]
I might be reading parts of it wrong, but I think that's a different sort of thing to the research in the article.Sugar is a very indirect cause of heart attacks, everyone knows that most heart attacks are a culmination of decades of diet and exercise habits. It's still worth researching everything to do with that, but it's pretty low value research because it's hard to draw any actionable conclusions from it other than "eat healthier and exercise", which is already well known.The research in the article is talking about a direct cause. Bacteria exists on arterial plaque, viral infection triggers bacteria to multiply, something about that process causes the plaque to detach and cause a heart attack. If that ends up being a rock solid cause and effect, even for a subset of heart attacks, that could lead to things like direct prevention (anti-virals before the heart attack happens) or changes in patient management (everyone with artery disease gets put far away from sick patients) that could directly and immediately save a lot of lives.The post you replied to was saying that the data from the study isn't as strong as the article and headline make it out to be, which is usually the case. For this one though I'm reading that less as "it's a nothingburger" and more as "it's a small interesting result that needs a lot of follow up".replylithocarpus 3 hours ago

While you're not technically wrong, I find this whole approach to be not good.And actually, if as a lot of science is now suggesting, inflammation and damage due to eating oxidization-prone lipids (aka refined oils) in combination with refined sugar is a big part of the cause of arterial damage and heart disease, that could be easily be the biggest root cause in most of these cases.
The bacteria if they even play a causal role at any point, could be a result of previous damage due to diet (and lack of exercise).The paper's idea of treating heart disease by giving patients antibiotics seems really problematic to me.
Destroy your health with poor diet and lack of exercise, and then once you start to feel the effect of this, take antibiotics and destroy your gut health too.replynavigate8310 3 hours ago

While do do agree with the general premise of your comment, that is, correct the root cause. For some, "eat healthy and exercise", may not be an option, because they are already addicted and overweight. At least, taking anti-biotics could be the very first line of actionable treatment to prevent the bacterial buildup and save their life immediately.replyitsoktocry 1 hour ago

You can develop cervical cancer via some other route, but the vast, vast majority of cervical cancers are caused by HPV infection.What are these other ways?

Computer programs always fail in predictable — but usually unpredicted — ways.Human bodies, not so much, mostly because we lack the capability to monitor, measure and emulate the behaviour of such complex systems. As such, we gain medical knowledge using statistics, usually covering most common "failure modes" first, but we increasingly learn that those are never as clear cut either as our observation technology improves (as it does with science otherwise too — eg. Newtonian mechanics is completely true up to some error bars and constraints achievable in that period).replyepcoa 5 hours ago

Anecdotally, I had a myocardial infarction at 23, and I was honestly surprised to learn that it wasn’t already well known that infectious diseases could trigger such events.Up until that point, I’d never had any heart-related issues, nor does anyone in my family. Just two days before being admitted to the hospital with a suspected heart attack, I came down with food poisoning. It wasn’t pleasant, of course, but I thought it was nothing unusual—something a couple of days of rest and hydration would normally resolve.Since my bloodwork at the hospital matched the expected results for a heart attack, and I underwent surgery, the doctors understandably focused on treating the immediate problem rather than identifying the underlying cause (I’m eternally grateful to the team and staff at St. Vincentius-Kliniken. I truly don’t think I’d be here without them).That said, I’m glad to see this area receiving more attention. Hopefully, it will lead to further studies and the development of better strategies for prevention and treatment.replyn8henrie 8 hours ago

"simple, obvious and wrong".Phages are intensely species specific to bacterial species, so they don't work unless you identify exactly what you're targeting. Also, even if they can penetrate biofilms, that doesn't mean you can successfully deliver them to the biofilm in the human body, since they have to survive the whole blood stream and the normal human immune response to "not self" things.replydredmorbius 9 hours ago
| root | parent | next [–]
Adding to this:
a chief advantage of antibiotics (particularly the early ones)
is that they were both broad-spectrum (controlling a vast array of bacteria) and sparing of non-bacterial cells (e.g., those of our own bodies).Evolved resistance is changing at least the first part of that relationship.Phages as you note are far more tailored, and may (if I understand correctly) need to be targeted to a patient's specific infection's genetic line.
It's as if you had to select ammunition based on the specific type of target you were hunting, if not specific individuals.
In the early days of antibiotics it was far more a case of "fire and forget" with a single magic bullet.

This is a nicely-designed study. For decades, we've known that inflammation is a risk factor for heart attacks.In this study, the researchers designed a custom antibody that binds to oral bacteria. Then they used histological staining to identify specific biofilm structures inside the atherosclerotic tissue. Bacteria released from the biofilm were observed in heart attack cases, which gives us evidence that when the body's immune system responded to these bacteria, it triggered inflammation which ruptured cholesterol-laden plaque. So now we have more insight into the mechanism behind why inflammation is associated with heart attack risk.The "pantheon" of risk factors for heart disease are:* hs-CRP (inflammation): the mechanism studied by this research. High inflammation roughly doubles your risk of heart disease.* ApoB - 20% of people with normal cholesterol will have abnormal ApoB, and be at risk of heart disease (ApoB is a structural protein in lipoproteins which cause arterial plaque).* Lp(a) - the strongest hereditary risk factor for heart disease (Lp(a) acts as a multiplier on ApoB, since it camouflages cholesterol particles from your liver)* HbA1c - insulin resistance /diabetes is a risk factor for just about everything.* eGFR - estimates the volume of liquid your kidneys can filter, and is an input to the latest heart disease risk models (PREVENT).All of these risk factors can be measured with a blood test + doctor review.

You should probably disclose that the order link at the end of your post goes to your own company.Basic LDL cholesterol and triglycerides blood panels are still an essential part of heart disease bloodwork, too.I would suggest most people start by asking your doctor for some of these tests at your next annual checkup, as many of them and the doctor visit are likely covered by insurance. The ACA has special handling for routine annual checkups, so don’t assume it’s going to be expensive until you’ve checked the cost with your insurance. A routine bloodwork panel will also include a number of other important measures that are routine and very cheap. It’s helpful to have all of these on your medical record so trends can be identified over time.replyel_benhameen 7 hours ago

IANAD, but1) Isn't ApoB measurement pretty much in tandem with LDL, VLDL, and triglycerides? I realize it's being recognized now as the necessary factor for arterial dysfunction, but it seems like a lot of hoopla is being made as if it were some "silent" overlooked factor when for the vast, vast majority of people their ApoB levels are entirely explained by the other 3 lipid panel line items carrying it, and they have been in use for decades and are strongly targeted by the medical establishment2) Isn't Lp(a) a separate lipoprotein altogether which is an independent risk factor for MACE? I've never heard of it "disguising" other cholesterol in testing.replybrandonb 8 hours ago

1) ApoB itself is more accurate than LDL and triglycerides. The latest evidence is that ApoB and Lp(a) together are more accurate than even LDL, VLDL, non-HDL, triglerycerides, etc combined: https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-abstract/46/27/27...2) The terminology is confusing, but each Lp(a) particle is "just" a cholesterol particle wrapped with an extra protein, apoprotein (a). So each Lp(a) particle includes one ApoB molecule (the structural protein in atherogenic cholesterol particles) and many cholesterol and triglyceride molecules, but the extra protein makes each Lp(a) particle about 6x more atherogenic than a typical cholesterol particle.replydogmatism 8 hours ago

For lipids, besides the named tests, HDL, LDL, and triglyceride tests are older but shouldn't be overlooked.For measuring inflammation, besides hs-CRP, additional tests are relevant and overlooked: regular CRP, ESR, and homocysteine.Additionally, a heart attack can result from parasite induced inflammation too, e.g. in chagas disease, which is becoming increasingly common in the US while being very undetected without explicit testing. It is also very difficult to treat, but the gist 4196f31d12a43a95756e792500ff516f has some info on treating it. Lyme disease too can harm the heart permanently. In both cases a pacemaker could help as applicable.replybrandonb 11 hours ago

Can you expand more on why you'd want regular CRP over hs-CRP (specifically for cardiovascular risk)?For homocysteine, one proxy is B12 or folate (which are more cost-effective to test). To my knowledge, ESR is used in certain rheumatologic conditions, and was used more often in the past, but isn't currently used for heart disease.replyOutOfHere 11 hours ago

It is true that hs-CRP is relevant for cardiovascular risk. CRP and ESR are more for broader inflammatory risk, for acute and chronic values respectively.replygiveita 11 hours ago

The original title is "Myocardial infarction may be an infectious disease" which appears to be clickbait, with the title posted here being much more accurate.Immune response to bacteria in arterial plaques can cause them to break up and cause the attack (my lay-interpretation) so the bacteria is a trigger, but "infectious disease" is a bit of hyperbole.replyJumpCrisscross 11 hours ago

Gaining a ton of body mass working out thickens the heart. It's necessary to push the blood into veins that get constricted, more and more with increased weight. In the epilogue, as you get older, optimal function fades. The thickened tissue isn't as elastic, compounding cardiac problems and sometimes causing infarction (also, not infectious related). Ironically, a thickened heart gives you better odds at surviving surgery, due to the excess tissue and the minimal effect of scarring already-rigid tissue.Some people see heart walls thinning at a very ripe age (90s+) but for most early heart patients, they don't make it that far.replyimperfect_light 6 hours ago

Titles like this are very confusing. The paper better explains it, but a disease can't be contagious or infectious.

| parent | next [–]
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/what-does-the-fl...How does flu affect the heart? The virus only rarely infects the heart directly. Instead, the adverse effects of the virus on the heart are due to atherosclerosis of the arteries of the heart. Many people over age 50 have atherosclerosis — and in some people it has not yet been diagnosed. Because atherosclerosis narrows the arteries and reduces the flow of blood, less oxygen reaches the heart muscle. When the effect of the flu on the lungs lowers the amount of oxygen in the blood, this further reduces the supply of oxygen to the heart. This can lead to a heart attack or cardiac arrest (sudden death).Is this risk more than theoretical? Many careful studies have shown there is an increased risk of heart disease following a bout of flu. In one study of 80,000 adults with influenza, nearly 12% had a serious cardiac event, such as a heart attack, during or in the weeks after getting the flu.replyweird-eye-issue 8 hours ago

We know. We knew for a long time.We also have quite a few of anti biofilm agents in IV formulations that could have an effect inside of the cardiovascular system if used in high dosages, but the molecules are old, cheap and unsexy, so no one will try.
