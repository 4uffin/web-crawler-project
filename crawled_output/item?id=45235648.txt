This is a nicely-designed study. For decades, we've known that inflammation is a risk factor for heart attacks.In this study, the researchers designed a custom antibody that binds to oral bacteria. Then they used histological staining to identify specific biofilm structures inside the atherosclerotic tissue. Bacteria released from the biofilm were observed in heart attack cases, which gives us evidence that when the body's immune system responded to these bacteria, it triggered inflammation which ruptured cholesterol-laden plaque. So now we have more insight into the mechanism behind why inflammation is associated with heart attack risk.The "pantheon" of risk factors for heart disease are:* hs-CRP (inflammation): the mechanism studied by this research. High inflammation roughly doubles your risk of heart disease.* ApoB - 20% of people with normal cholesterol will have abnormal ApoB, and be at risk of heart disease (ApoB is a structural protein in lipoproteins which cause arterial plaque).* Lp(a) - the strongest hereditary risk factor for heart disease (Lp(a) acts as a multiplier on ApoB, since it camouflages cholesterol particles from your liver)* HbA1c - insulin resistance /diabetes is a risk factor for just about everything.* eGFR - estimates the volume of liquid your kidneys can filter, and is an input to the latest heart disease risk models (PREVENT).All of these risk factors can be measured with a blood test + doctor review.

You should probably disclose that the order link at the end of your post goes to your own company.Basic LDL cholesterol and triglycerides blood panels are still an essential part of heart disease bloodwork, too.I would suggest most people start by asking your doctor for some of these tests at your next annual checkup, as many of them and the doctor visit are likely covered by insurance. The ACA has special handling for routine annual checkups, so don’t assume it’s going to be expensive until you’ve checked the cost with your insurance. A routine bloodwork panel will also include a number of other important measures that are routine and very cheap. It’s helpful to have all of these on your medical record so trends can be identified over time.replylr4444lr 1 hour ago

IANAD, but1) Isn't ApoB measurement pretty much in tandem with LDL, VLDL, and triglycerides? I realize it's being recognized now as the necessary factor for arterial dysfunction, but it seems like a lot of hoopla is being made as if it were some "silent" overlooked factor when for the vast, vast majority of people their ApoB levels are entirely explained by the other 3 lipid panel line items carrying it, and they have been in use for decades and are strongly targeted by the medical establishment2) Isn't Lp(a) a separate lipoprotein altogether which is an independent risk factor for MACE? I've never heard of it "disguising" other cholesterol in testing.replybrandonb 11 minutes ago

1) ApoB itself is more accurate than LDL and triglycerides. The latest evidence is that ApoB and Lp(a) together are more accurate than even LDL, VLDL, non-HDL, triglerycerides, etc combined: https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-abstract/46/27/27...2) The terminology is confusing, but each Lp(a) particle is "just" a cholesterol particle wrapped with an extra protein, apoprotein (a). So each Lp(a) particle includes one ApoB molecule (the structural protein in atherogenic cholesterol particles) and many cholesterol and triglyceride molecules, but the extra protein makes each Lp(a) particle about 6x more atherogenic than a typical cholesterol particle.replyandy99 2 hours ago

The reason I would do it, or do it when in the US is just the convenience. Seeing a doctor is complicated and obviously involves at least one extra step. If you just go and get the tests and have the info, it simplifies things, which is presumably the reason why these direct to consumer options exist in the US.It's interesting to hear that notionally they have the same model as us of a doctor needing to prescribe the test.

Yes, there is an ordering physician.The parent commenter we're both responding to said "I can go to a lab, order this, and pay for it." -- the point I'm trying to make is that the system in the US is basically the same, since the ordering physician is employed by the lab testing company and you never interact with them, so it's as if they don't exist for the purposes of comparing to Greece.Edit: I see you own a blood testing startup!

For lipids, besides the named tests, HDL, LDL, and triglyceride tests are older but shouldn't be overlooked.For measuring inflammation, besides hs-CRP, additional tests are relevant and overlooked: regular CRP, ESR, and homocysteine.Additionally, a heart attack can result from parasite induced inflammation too, e.g. in chagas disease, which is becoming increasingly common in the US while being very undetected without explicit testing. It is also very difficult to treat, but the gist 4196f31d12a43a95756e792500ff516f has some info on treating it. Lyme disease too can harm the heart permanently. In both cases a pacemaker could help as applicable.replybrandonb 2 hours ago

Can you expand more on why you'd want regular CRP over hs-CRP (specifically for cardiovascular risk)?For homocysteine, one proxy is B12 or folate (which are more cost-effective to test). To my knowledge, ESR is used in certain rheumatologic conditions, and was used more often in the past, but isn't currently used for heart disease.replyOutOfHere 2 hours ago

Anecdotally, I had a myocardial infarction at 23, and I was honestly surprised to learn that it wasn’t already well known that infectious diseases could trigger such events.Up until that point, I’d never had any heart-related issues, nor does anyone in my family. Just two days before being admitted to the hospital with a suspected heart attack, I came down with food poisoning. It wasn’t pleasant, of course, but I thought it was nothing unusual—something a couple of days of rest and hydration would normally resolve.Since my bloodwork at the hospital matched the expected results for a heart attack, and I underwent surgery, the doctors understandably focused on treating the immediate problem rather than identifying the underlying cause (I’m eternally grateful to the team and staff at St. Vincentius-Kliniken. I truly don’t think I’d be here without them).That said, I’m glad to see this area receiving more attention. Hopefully, it will lead to further studies and the development of better strategies for prevention and treatment.replytbrownaw 3 hours ago

So knowing that all the plans towards eliminating this disease focus on HPV.On the other hand most people with "flu" in summer months are not infected with Influenza, so an improved influenza treatment isn't going to make a big difference for them unlike in winter.

"simple, obvious and wrong".Phages are intensely species specific to bacterial species, so they don't work unless you identify exactly what you're targeting.

Adding to this:
a chief advantage of antibiotics (particularly the early ones)
is that they were both broad-spectrum (controlling a vast array of bacteria) and sparing of non-bacterial cells (e.g., those of our own bodies).Evolved resistance is changing at least the first part of that relationship.Phages as you note are far more tailored, and may (if I understand correctly) need to be targeted to a patient's specific infection's genetic line.
It's as if you had to select ammunition based on the specific type of target you were hunting, if not specific individuals.
In the early days of antibiotics it was far more a case of "fire and forget" with a single magic bullet.

The original title is "Myocardial infarction may be an infectious disease" which appears to be clickbait, with the title posted here being much more accurate.Immune response to bacteria in arterial plaques can cause them to break up and cause the attack (my lay-interpretation) so the bacteria is a trigger, but "infectious disease" is a bit of hyperbole.replyJumpCrisscross 2 hours ago

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/what-does-the-fl...How does flu affect the heart? The virus only rarely infects the heart directly. Instead, the adverse effects of the virus on the heart are due to atherosclerosis of the arteries of the heart. Many people over age 50 have atherosclerosis — and in some people it has not yet been diagnosed. Because atherosclerosis narrows the arteries and reduces the flow of blood, less oxygen reaches the heart muscle. When the effect of the flu on the lungs lowers the amount of oxygen in the blood, this further reduces the supply of oxygen to the heart. This can lead to a heart attack or cardiac arrest (sudden death).Is this risk more than theoretical? Many careful studies have shown there is an increased risk of heart disease following a bout of flu. In one study of 80,000 adults with influenza, nearly 12% had a serious cardiac event, such as a heart attack, during or in the weeks after getting the flu.replyop00to 2 hours ago
