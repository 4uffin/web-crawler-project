The article differs substantively from the actual conclusions of the study. This study shows a minor correlation in some bacterial DNA "signatures" in arterial plaque in about 200 people (~40% had the correlated bacteria). The study only included tissues from people who died of heart disease or had surgery related to heart disease. There does not currently appear to be a strong baseline about how widespread this bacterial signature may exist in a broad population regardless of health.In a nutshell there is a slightly interesting idea that deserves further study. That's it.replylithocarpus 16 minutes ago

Interesting.So, one could make a similar article saying "Myocardial infarction may be caused by sugar consumption" and support it by analyzing the recent diet of 200 people who died of heart disease and finding that 95% of them recently consumed a lot of sugar.replyDaveZale 1 hour ago

I think the first question to be addressed should be, does the general population have similar prevalence of this bacteria?I didn't read the article but just based on the parent comment, it sounds like this baseline hasn't yet been established.
It seems very wrong to start testing antibiotics without first establishing the baseline of whether everyone has this bacteria.replytbrownaw 6 hours ago

It's not even "here's another way this can happen" - there's no real evidence that the bacteria are causing the heart disease.

Of course it depends on fractions. You can develop cervical cancer via some other route, but the vast, vast majority of cervical cancers are caused by HPV infection. So knowing that all the plans towards eliminating this disease focus on HPV.On the other hand most people with "flu" in summer months are not infected with Influenza, so an improved influenza treatment isn't going to make a big difference for them unlike in winter. We know other reasons you might get those symptoms which are more likely in summer.replydredmorbius 3 hours ago

This is a nicely-designed study. For decades, we've known that inflammation is a risk factor for heart attacks.In this study, the researchers designed a custom antibody that binds to oral bacteria. Then they used histological staining to identify specific biofilm structures inside the atherosclerotic tissue. Bacteria released from the biofilm were observed in heart attack cases, which gives us evidence that when the body's immune system responded to these bacteria, it triggered inflammation which ruptured cholesterol-laden plaque. So now we have more insight into the mechanism behind why inflammation is associated with heart attack risk.The "pantheon" of risk factors for heart disease are:* hs-CRP (inflammation): the mechanism studied by this research. High inflammation roughly doubles your risk of heart disease.* ApoB - 20% of people with normal cholesterol will have abnormal ApoB, and be at risk of heart disease (ApoB is a structural protein in lipoproteins which cause arterial plaque).* Lp(a) - the strongest hereditary risk factor for heart disease (Lp(a) acts as a multiplier on ApoB, since it camouflages cholesterol particles from your liver)* HbA1c - insulin resistance /diabetes is a risk factor for just about everything.* eGFR - estimates the volume of liquid your kidneys can filter, and is an input to the latest heart disease risk models (PREVENT).All of these risk factors can be measured with a blood test + doctor review.

You should probably disclose that the order link at the end of your post goes to your own company.Basic LDL cholesterol and triglycerides blood panels are still an essential part of heart disease bloodwork, too.I would suggest most people start by asking your doctor for some of these tests at your next annual checkup, as many of them and the doctor visit are likely covered by insurance. The ACA has special handling for routine annual checkups, so don’t assume it’s going to be expensive until you’ve checked the cost with your insurance. A routine bloodwork panel will also include a number of other important measures that are routine and very cheap. It’s helpful to have all of these on your medical record so trends can be identified over time.replyel_benhameen 1 hour ago

IANAD, but1) Isn't ApoB measurement pretty much in tandem with LDL, VLDL, and triglycerides? I realize it's being recognized now as the necessary factor for arterial dysfunction, but it seems like a lot of hoopla is being made as if it were some "silent" overlooked factor when for the vast, vast majority of people their ApoB levels are entirely explained by the other 3 lipid panel line items carrying it, and they have been in use for decades and are strongly targeted by the medical establishment2) Isn't Lp(a) a separate lipoprotein altogether which is an independent risk factor for MACE? I've never heard of it "disguising" other cholesterol in testing.replybrandonb 3 hours ago

1) ApoB itself is more accurate than LDL and triglycerides. The latest evidence is that ApoB and Lp(a) together are more accurate than even LDL, VLDL, non-HDL, triglerycerides, etc combined: https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-abstract/46/27/27...2) The terminology is confusing, but each Lp(a) particle is "just" a cholesterol particle wrapped with an extra protein, apoprotein (a). So each Lp(a) particle includes one ApoB molecule (the structural protein in atherogenic cholesterol particles) and many cholesterol and triglyceride molecules, but the extra protein makes each Lp(a) particle about 6x more atherogenic than a typical cholesterol particle.replydogmatism 2 hours ago

For lipids, besides the named tests, HDL, LDL, and triglyceride tests are older but shouldn't be overlooked.For measuring inflammation, besides hs-CRP, additional tests are relevant and overlooked: regular CRP, ESR, and homocysteine.Additionally, a heart attack can result from parasite induced inflammation too, e.g. in chagas disease, which is becoming increasingly common in the US while being very undetected without explicit testing. It is also very difficult to treat, but the gist 4196f31d12a43a95756e792500ff516f has some info on treating it. Lyme disease too can harm the heart permanently.

"simple, obvious and wrong".Phages are intensely species specific to bacterial species, so they don't work unless you identify exactly what you're targeting.

Adding to this:
a chief advantage of antibiotics (particularly the early ones)
is that they were both broad-spectrum (controlling a vast array of bacteria) and sparing of non-bacterial cells (e.g., those of our own bodies).Evolved resistance is changing at least the first part of that relationship.Phages as you note are far more tailored, and may (if I understand correctly) need to be targeted to a patient's specific infection's genetic line.
It's as if you had to select ammunition based on the specific type of target you were hunting, if not specific individuals.
In the early days of antibiotics it was far more a case of "fire and forget" with a single magic bullet.

Gaining a ton of body mass working out thickens the heart. It's necessary to push the blood into veins that get constricted, more and more with increased weight. In the epilogue, as you get older, optimal function fades. The thickened tissue isn't as elastic, compounding cardiac problems and sometimes causing infarction (also, not infectious related). Ironically, a thickened heart gives you better odds at surviving surgery, due to the excess tissue and the minimal effect of scarring already-rigid tissue.Some people see heart walls thinning at a very ripe age (90s+) but for most early heart patients, they don't make it that far.replythor-rodrigues 3 hours ago

Anecdotally, I had a myocardial infarction at 23, and I was honestly surprised to learn that it wasn’t already well known that infectious diseases could trigger such events.Up until that point, I’d never had any heart-related issues, nor does anyone in my family. Just two days before being admitted to the hospital with a suspected heart attack, I came down with food poisoning. It wasn’t pleasant, of course, but I thought it was nothing unusual—something a couple of days of rest and hydration would normally resolve.Since my bloodwork at the hospital matched the expected results for a heart attack, and I underwent surgery, the doctors understandably focused on treating the immediate problem rather than identifying the underlying cause (I’m eternally grateful to the team and staff at St. Vincentius-Kliniken. I truly don’t think I’d be here without them).That said, I’m glad to see this area receiving more attention.

This raises two questions.- Does this suggest that courses of antibiotics might reduce heart attack risk?- Does this suggest that regular use of, e.g., Listerine might reduce heart attack risk?
(While, perhaps, slightly increasing esophageal cancer risk.)It would be interesting to run an epidemiological study to see if current interventions move the needle in a meaningful way.replyprmph 4 hours ago

Listerine would make it worse for sure.Don't use "antiseptic" mouthwash; it kills beneficial bacteria in the mouth, causing bad bacteria to multiply.I have personal experience of this.replydionian 4 hours ago

agreed, after much research the only mouth wash i use is therasolreplyygouzerh 4 hours ago

For the Listerine part: they are referencing this study: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16373688/ that seems to show a correlation between poor oral health and sudden cardiac death, so it might help indeed, with other good oral health practices.replyDaveZale 4 hours ago

I only use very dilute Listerine - for the fluoride.
A dentist told me that undiluted, alcohol based products can cause tissue damage (which conceivably would result in a vector for oral bacteria infiltrating to the bloodstream?)replyinferiorhuman 2 hours ago

Most Listerine products do not contain fluoride.
Additionally, there are a variety of readily available alcohol-free mouthwashes that have fluoride.replygertop 2 hours ago

Alcohol-free mouthwash is even more likely to cause tissue damage because they almost all contain SLS. Some people are more sensitive to it than others (causing the mucosa to peel) but it causes mild damage to everybody.replysteadicat 49 minutes ago

Almost all? I just checked and Act, Crest, CloSYS and many others are all SLS-free and alcohol-free. The only one with SLS I could find is Listerine Cool Mint.Maybe you’re thinking toothpastes? SLS in toothpaste is indeed hard to avoid.replysyntaxing 5 hours ago

I probably should find sources first but I was always under the impression that the mouth biome is strongly correlated to gut biome which strongly correlated to immune system.replydreamcompiler 4 hours ago

TFA says the biofilms protect the bacteria from antibiotics. Better approach is probably engineered antibodies or even a phage (engineered virus that attacks the bacteria).replytim333 4 hours ago

Yes, there are studies where they compared heart attack rates for people who'd taken a course of antibiotics with those who hadn't and there was quite a large effect in some of them.eg. https://www.science.org/content/article/antibiotics-cut-hear...replyop00to 5 hours ago

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/what-does-the-fl...How does flu affect the heart? The virus only rarely infects the heart directly. Instead, the adverse effects of the virus on the heart are due to atherosclerosis of the arteries of the heart. Many people over age 50 have atherosclerosis — and in some people it has not yet been diagnosed. Because atherosclerosis narrows the arteries and reduces the flow of blood, less oxygen reaches the heart muscle. When the effect of the flu on the lungs lowers the amount of oxygen in the blood, this further reduces the supply of oxygen to the heart. This can lead to a heart attack or cardiac arrest (sudden death).Is this risk more than theoretical? Many careful studies have shown there is an increased risk of heart disease following a bout of flu. In one study of 80,000 adults with influenza, nearly 12% had a serious cardiac event, such as a heart attack, during or in the weeks after getting the flu.replyweird-eye-issue 2 hours ago

> In one study of 80,000 adults with influenza, nearly 12% had a serious cardiac event, such as a heart attack, during or in the weeks after getting the flu.That sounds really highOkay I just looked it up and this was only among hospitalized individuals which makes a lot more sense because most people just stay home unless it's very bad but that is still surprising to mereplyop00to 4 hours ago

In the context of the article, it's inflammation rupturing the 'fibrous cap' on plaque deposits leading to a heart attack, so I presume OP is talking about the inflammatory response to having the flu.replysmt88 4 hours ago

> How does flu affect the heart?Even temporary stress on the respiratory system can cause long-term damage to the brain, lungs, and heart. Because of Covid, we started to learn that an acute, severe infection can affect people much later.That research led to the beginning of an understanding that repeated flu infections can contribute to premature death even many decades later.replyDaveZale 5 hours ago
