SolomonsNoir talk contribs (→Early life:
This does not belong here. First, the claim that red-headed individuals are connected to a battle in the Mexican-American war is not sourced. In addition, not all those from Ireland have red hair. Many in Mexico have red hair with no Irish ancestry of course. Having red hair does not signal Irish ancestry. Second, Canelo has NEVER claimed Irish ancestry. In addition, the source does not cite where the quote was said and appears to be from a blog style entry.)
