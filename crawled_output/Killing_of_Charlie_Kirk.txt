On September 10, 2025, right-wing American conservative political activist Charlie Kirk was fatally shot while addressing an audience on the campus of Utah Valley University (UVU) in Orem, Utah, United States. The outdoor event was the first in the fall portion of his American Comeback Tour, organized by Turning Point USA, which he co-founded.
The killing was highlighted as an instance of increasing political violence within the United States and prompted widespread reactions from public figures both domestically and internationally. Social media reactions to the shooting saw significant discussion, in particular around the rapid dissemination of uncensored footage of Kirk being shot. A suspect was arrested on September 12 following a manhunt, and is currently believed to be the only person involved.
Background
Charlie Kirk's last appearance at a political rally: with Nate Morris in Shepherdsville, Kentucky, June 2025[1]
Charlie Kirk was an American conservative political activist, author, and media personality, known for being the co-founder and CEO of Turning Point USA.[2] A close ally of United States president Donald Trump, Kirk utilized his skills in social media and campus organizing to become a highly influential figure in the "hard-right movement".[3] Described as "something of a kingmaker" by The New York Times, Kirk was able to rally support to protect embattled Trump cabinet nominees and against Republican Party figures he deemed insufficiently supportive of Trump.[3] The Washington Post described him as "one of the most prominent voices on the right" in recent years.[4] Axios described Kirk as a "driving force" in Donald Trump's presidential campaigns.[5]
Kirk's killing occurred during a period of deepening division and increasingly frequent violence in American politics.[6][7][8] It followed a series of violent political incidents, including the June 2025 shootings of two Minnesota legislators and their spouses,[9][10] the May 2025 killing of two Israeli embassy staffers in Washington D.C.,[11][12] the April 2025 arson attack on Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro's residence,[13][14] the December 2024 killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson[15][16] and assassination attempts on Donald Trump in July and September 2024.[8][17][18] Other instances of political violence in recent years include the hammer attack on Paul Pelosi in 2022,[18][19] the January 6 Capitol attack in 2021,[20][21] and the Congressional baseball shooting in 2017.[22][23]
Event and security
Kirk's last political rally prior to the event at Utah Valley University took place in Kentucky, where he appeared alongside United States Senate candidate Nate Morris.[24] Kirk's appearance at UVU was the first stop of his American Comeback Tour for the fall.[2] He was traveling with private security, with additional protection provided by university police and local authorities.[25] A petition was circulated calling on the university to cancel his appearance, but the university stated it would allow him to speak in accordance with its free speech and open discussion policies.[26]
Approximately 3,000 people[25] attended the event, which was secured by six police officers and Kirk's private security personnel.[27] Attendees later criticized the relaxed security, noting that no ticket was required to enter the amphitheater and that metal detectors were not used.[28]
Killing
Richard D. & Joann B. Losee Center in 2005. The shot was fired from the rooftop.
Officials stated the suspected gunman "arrived on campus in a gray Dodge Challenger" at 8:29 a.m. Mountain Daylight Time (MDT).[29] Security camera footage examined by investigators showed he was dressed differently than later around the time of the shooting.[29]
Investigators stated the suspect appeared again in video starting at around 11:50 a.m., when he moved through a grassy area into a parking lot near campus. Video posted by TMZ on X appears to show the suspect in the area described by the investigators.[29] At 11:53 a.m. he stopped at the top of some stairs and "pulled out his phone" before proceeding into a pedestrian tunnel.[29] Still images put out by the F.B.I. show him going up a stairwell in a parking garage next to the tunnel.[29] The speaking event began at 12 noon.[30] Authorities said he was seen at 12:02 p.m. walking on the north side of the Losee Center, where they said he would later shoot Kirk from the roof.[29] According to an affidavit, the suspect entered the Losee Center from the southeast side, and 13 minutes later was seen ascending stairs next to the building.[29] Investigators said by 12:22 p.m. he was on the roof lying on his stomach facing the location where Kirk was speaking[29] At 12:23 p.m., Kirk was shot in the neck while speaking at the event.[30][31]
Sitting under a tent displaying the tour title, Kirk was in a back and forth exchange with UVU student Hunter Kozak[32][33] about mass shootings in the United States.[34][35] A single shot was fired during the exchange, which hit Kirk in the neck.[36][25] According to the university, the shot came from the roof of the Losee Center, itself 200 yards (180 m) away;[37][38] following the discovery of the shooter's position during the subsequent investigation, this was later revised to 142 yards (130 m).[39] Emma Pitts, a Deseret News reporter who witnessed the event, told National Public Radio, "I just saw so much blood come out of the left side of Charlie's neck, and then he went limp."[35]
Former U.S. representative Jason Chaffetz, who was in attendance, stated, "As soon as the shot went out, everybody hit the deck and everybody started scattering and yelling and screaming."[25] Another witness told The New York Times that "no one really got down until the people in front of the stage did" and that "people got down in waves."[40] An eyewitness reported to CBS News that there was "blood pouring everywhere."[41]
Video footage also surfaced of the suspected shooter running from the south corner of the Losee Center roof, where he purportedly shot Kirk, to the north corner, where the ground was higher and he could hang from the edge of the roof and drop to the ground, which occurred at about 12:24 p.m.[30] Palm prints were later found at the edge of the roof, as well as smudges from which samples were collected to look for DNA, and a footprint was found on the ground, which showed he was wearing Converse tennis shoes. He then moved into a wooded area north of the campus, where the gun was later found.[30][42]
According to police audio, the first report of the shooting occurred at 12:26 p.m. At 12:31 p.m., an officer then reported "gunshots heard near the library." At 12:35 p.m., the officer added "maybe the CS building", before describing the shooter as "wearing jeans, black shirt, black mask, long rifle." A minute later, the officer elaborated "on top of the building on the far north side, just east of the library."[43]
Kirk was pronounced dead at the Timpanogos Regional Hospital in Orem,[25][44] after undergoing emergency surgery.[45][46] His death was announced by Donald Trump at 2:40 p.m. on Truth Social.[47][48] On September 11, Kirk's casket, along with Vance, Second Lady Usha Vance, and Kirk's wife Erika Kirk,[49] was transported on Air Force Two from Utah to Phoenix, Arizona, where they lived.[50]
Investigation and campus response
On the day of the shooting, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) assisted at the scene.[46] A manhunt ensued as authorities searched for the perpetrator.[51]
School response
At 12:37 p.m., the university closed the campus and urged everyone to leave.[52] At 2:01 p.m., the university instructed those remaining on campus to "secure in place until police officers can escort you safely off campus."[53]
Classes and activities at all campuses, including satellite locations, were suspended until September 15.[54]
Videos
Within minutes of the shooting, graphic videos of the killing recorded by attendees began circulating on social media where they were viewed millions of times.[55] Some platforms added warnings or age restrictions, while others tried to remove the footage.[55][56] Some commentators predicted that the widespread online circulation of videos showing the killing of such a prominent figure was unprecedented and likely to have lasting consequences.[among whom?] Emerson Brooking, the director of strategy at the Digital Forensic Research Lab of the Atlantic Council, stated: "This is the first time such a widely recognized figure has been murdered in such a public way and spread this way on social media."[55]
Initial arrests
Two people were arrested in the aftermath of the shooting, but both were released and authorities later said that neither was the shooter.[57] Police arrested conservative-libertarian activist George Zinn, on campus grounds, after Zinn claimed to have shot Kirk.[58] Authorities later clarified the arrest was for potential obstruction of justice and that Zinn had already been released; it was also reported that Zinn had a history of mental health issues and disrupting public events.[58]
Within hours of the shooting, FBI director Kash Patel announced on social media that "the subject" in Kirk's killing had been apprehended, while Utah governor Spencer Cox stated that a "person of interest" was detained. Within two hours of Patel's initial announcement, he stated the subject had been "released after an interrogation by law enforcement."[59][57]
Manhunt
Authorities stated that the shooter had fled the scene from the rooftop of the Losee Center.[60][61] In a press conference on September 11, officials said that they have "good video footage" and were trying to identify the killer using facial recognition.[61] Later that day, the FBI released photos of a person of interest, indicating that efforts to identify him through facial recognition had been unsuccessful,[62] and offered a reward of up to $100,000 for information.[63] Law enforcement recovered an older-make Mauser-type bolt action hunting rifle chambered in .30-06[64][65] from a wooded area near the shooting,[66] engraved bullets, and "footwear impression, a palm print, and forearm imprints for analysis".[60][67]
Bullets found at the scene were inscribed with various messages and internet memes. The spent case was inscribed with, "Notices bulge OwO what's this?" a reference to furry online roleplay.[68] Three unfired rounds were engraved with: "Hey fascist! Catch! ↑→↓↓↓", the arrow symbols being a reference to a sequence of controller inputs used to release a bomb in the video game Helldivers 2; "Oh bella ciao bella ciao bella ciao ciao ciao", a reference to the Italian antifascist song "Bella ciao"; and "If you read this, you are gay LMAO."[68][69][70] The slogans have variously been interpreted by commentators as left-wing anti-fascist memes and catchphrases of far-right Groyper culture.[71][72] Early reporting, notably in The Wall Street Journal, falsely interpreted the inscriptions as having "pro-transgender" messaging, following an internal bulletin of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF).[73] The claims were met with calls for caution[74] and, when the details of the messages (which contained no transgender references) were made public, with calls for an apology.[75] The Wall Street Journal later retracted its claim.[76][77][78]
A manhunt ensued as authorities searched for the perpetrator, believed to be male and of college age.[51][79] The Utah Department of Public Safety released imagery of a person of interest at 6:05 MDT (UTC-06:00).[80][67] The killing was described as an assassination by Utah governor Spencer Cox.[81] However, the motive of the perpetrator remains unknown.[82] Both Cox and Donald Trump stated their wishes to pursue the death penalty against the perpetrator.[83][84]
Suspect
On September 12, Trump announced that the suspect was in police custody after his father convinced him to turn himself in.[85] In a subsequent press conference, Cox stated that this was the only planned arrest in the investigation and that charges are expected to be filed by September 16.[86] The suspect was living in an apartment in St. George, Utah, a 3 ½-hour drive from the scene of the shooting.[87]
His family were members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, although had not been very active in the church in the lead-up to the shooting.[88] He was registered to vote as not affiliated with any party. Nonetheless, the county clerk in his home county of Washington does not have a record of him ever casting a vote. According to people who knew him, the suspect was not fond of either Donald Trump or Charlie Kirk, though in 2020, while he was still in high school, he was known to have supported Donald Trump like the rest of his family. A family member of the suspect told investigators that at a recent family dinner, the two of them had talked about how they didn't like Kirk and the viewpoints he had, with the family member also stating Kirk was "spreading hate".[89]
At the time of his arrest, the suspect was 22-years-old and was in his third year in an electrical apprenticeship program at Dixie Technical College.[90] He had previously enrolled at Utah State University but dropped out after one semester.[90] From 2019–2021, while he was still in high school, he earned college credit from Utah Tech University.[90]
Reactions and analysis
American politicians
United States president Donald Trump addressed the nation from the Oval Office about the shooting; September 10, 2025.
The shooting saw bipartisan condemnation from politicians.[91] Messages of sympathy came from United States president Donald Trump,[92] First Lady Melania Trump,[93] Vice President JD Vance,[92] House speaker Mike Johnson, Senate majority leader John Thune,[94] and former president George W. Bush,[95] among other Republicans.[25] Democratic politicians also condemned the shooting, including former presidents Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, and Joe Biden,[25][96] Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries,[97] California governor Gavin Newsom, and Minnesota representative Ilhan Omar.[98]
Some politicians responded to the shooting by linking it to broader political debates. Some congressional Republicans placed blame on Democrats and accused liberals of "inciting violence with rhetoric".[99][100][101] Democrats and some news media pushed back against the claim, describing Trump's divisive rhetoric also factor in coarsening public debate and that political violence had impacted both parties. Democrats also used the event to further discussions of gun safety legislation.[102] Some Republicans also used the event to condemn liberal beliefs and ideology as evil.[103]
President Trump blamed the radical left for Kirk's and other recent deaths, saying they "compared wonderful Americans like Charlie to Nazis".[104][105] The response received criticism from Jonathan Allen, Jonathan Chait and The Guardian, who disapproved of Trump's rhetoric and his omission of recent Democratic victims of violence.[106][102][107][108] In response to Trump, Democratic Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro, himself the target of an arson attack, said: "The president shouldn't cherry-pick what counts and what doesn't count. When he does that, it gives a pass to some. We can't have that. This is a moment where leaders need to speak and act with moral clarity, where we need to condemn this type of violence in our communities, in our politics."[109] The next day, Trump stated that "We have radical left lunatics out there and we just have to beat the hell out of them", but later said he hoped his supporters would be nonviolent.[110][111] He reiterated his statements on Fox & Friends the following day.[112]
Following the shooting, while Kirk was still believed to be in critical condition, Johnson held a 30-second moment of silence in the U.S. House of Representatives for Kirk, observed by all House members. Following disagreements on the floor, the event descended into partisan rancor and accusations by both sides.[113] Trump ordered all flags to be flown at half-staff until that Sunday at 6 p.m. in Kirk's honor;[25] he later released a video tribute to him. The next day, Trump announced that Kirk would be posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.[114]
White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy Stephen Miller claimed in a post on X that Kirk's killing was the result of an "ideology" that is "at war with family and nature (...) that leads, always, inevitably and willfully, to violence," and must be defeated.[115][116] He reiterated his position in a live interview on Fox News, and said that Kirk's final message to him urged him to "dismantle and take on the radical left organizations in this country that are fomenting violence." Miller promised to do so using "the power of law enforcement, under President Trump's leadership,"[117][118][119]
Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said that The Pentagon is "tracking [...] very closely" any civilian and military employee who is a Kirk detractor or who celebrated his death, to impose punishment.[120][121] Christopher Landau, the United States Deputy Secretary of State, urged social media users to turn in foreign residents of the US who mocked or celebrated Kirk's death.[122] The US State Department said it would review the legal status of immigrants found to be "praising, rationalizing, or making light" of Kirk's killing.[123]
International response
Kirk's death garnered messages of condolence from world leaders and foreign politicians. British prime minister Keir Starmer, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Canadian prime minister Mark Carney, Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni, Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán, Czech prime minister Petr Fiala, Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese, Georgian prime minister Irakli Kobakhidze, Argentine president Javier Milei, Polish president Karol Nawrocki, New Zealand deputy prime minister David Seymour, Swedish deputy prime minister Ebba Busch, and Mexican president Claudia Sheinbaum offered their condolences and condemned the shooting.[124] Salvadoran president Nayib Bukele criticized the media's coverage of the event.[125] Paraguayan president Santiago Peña paid tribute to Kirk during a speech commemorating the 138th anniversary of the ruling Colorado Party.[126]
On September 11, the European Conservatives and Reformists Group (ECR Group) and Europe of Sovereign Nations Group (ESN Group), the right-wing and far-right political groups in the European Parliament, put forward a motion to hold a minute of silence to honor Kirk. The motion was rejected by Parliament president Roberta Metsola, though Swedish ECR Group MEP Charlie Weimers was permitted to make a statement on Kirk's shooting before the voting session began. Weimers' attempt to yield part of his time for a moment of silence was interrupted by Parliament vice president Katarina Barley.[127]
Media
Analyst Matthew Dowd was fired by MSNBC after he appraised Kirk as "one of the most divisive, especially divisive younger figures in this, who is constantly sort of pushing this sort of hate speech or sort of aimed at certain groups. And I always go back to, hateful thoughts lead to hateful words, which then lead to hateful actions."[128][129] A reporter in Florida was suspended for asking Congressional Representative Randy Fine if the shooting would prompt him to rethink his opposition to gun control.[130]
Fox News host Jesse Watters said, "They are at war with us," as well as commenting, "We're going to avenge Charlie's death in the way he would want it avenged," and that "Charlie would want us to put as much pressure on these people as possible."[131][132]
Progressive streamer Hasan Piker, who had been due to debate Kirk later in September, called the killing a "terrifying incident", and said: "The reverberation of people seeking out vengeance in the aftermath of this violent, abhorrent incident is going to be genuinely worrisome."[133]
Social media and public opinion
News of Kirk's death also provoked reactions on social media.[134][135][136] The New York Times described social media as featuring heartfelt messages from the left and right, anguish about political violence, and sharply partisan and political takes.[136] A remark Kirk had made following the 2023 Nashville school shooting, "It's worth to have a cost of, unfortunately, some gun deaths every single year so that we can have the Second Amendment to protect our other God-given rights," was reposted on social media in the aftermath of his shooting.[136]
Uncensored videos of Kirk being shot spread across social media with "lightning speed", according to the Associated Press.[137] United States Representative Anna Paulina Luna called on social media platforms to remove the video. The Tech Transparency Project, a nonprofit watchdog organization, reported that Instagram's Teen accounts, which are designed with additional safety features for teens, could readily find videos of the shooting. Organizations that monitor media for children, including Common Sense Media and Bark, a parental controls app, reported spikes in traffic following the shooting as parents sought out advice on how to talk to their kids about it and prevent them from seeing the video. The day after the shooting, most of the graphic videos had been removed from social media, though they still showed up in searches and algorithmic feeds, particularly on Twitter and TikTok.[138]
Several far-right figures encouraged retaliatory violence against Democrats and saw the death as a recruiting event.[99][139][140][115] A website called "Expose Charlie's Murderers" also invited users to submit links to people celebrating his murder.[98][140] Three days after the shooting, the site had accumulated 30000 submissions; cybersecurity experts characterized the site as a means to coordinate harassment, and as an echo of Turning Point USA's Professor Watchlist.[141][133]
Several news outlets noted that in the days after the shooting, multiple people—including teachers, firefighters, and members of the military and US Secret Service—were fired from their jobs for social media posts that praised or celebrated Kirk's killing, or suggested it was karmic.[142][143][144][145][146][147] The Oxford Union initiated disciplinary proceedings against its president-elect George Abaraonye, who had debated Kirk earlier in the year, after he posted comments appearing to celebrate Kirk's killing.[148][149] The day after the shooting, a YouGov poll asked several thousand US adults if it was acceptable to be happy at the death of a public figure; 56% said it was never acceptable (including 77% of Republicans and 38% of Democrats), 22% said it was usually unacceptable, 6% said it was usually acceptable, and 3% said it was always acceptable.[150]
Popular culture
On September 11, Comedy Central announced that it would be cancelling all scheduled re-runs of the South Park episode "Got a Nut", in which the character Eric Cartman portrayed a parodic version of Kirk.[151] This followed an online campaign to have the show cancelled over its satirical portrayal of Kirk so close to his death.[152] Kirk himself had expressed appreciation for his parody in the episode, describing it as "hilarious."[153]
DC Comics announced that it had canceled Gretchen Felker-Martin's Red Hood series just one day after its debut, following a series of comments published by Felker-Martin on Bluesky celebrating Kirk's death.[154][155]
