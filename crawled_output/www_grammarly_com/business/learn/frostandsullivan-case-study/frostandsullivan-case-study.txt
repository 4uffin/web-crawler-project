Frost & Sullivan is a consulting firm that uses its understanding of global value chains to identify and implement growth strategies for some of the world’s leading companies.
A time-consuming content creation process
At Frost & Sullivan, Tonya Fowler’s team is responsible for crafting research reports on some of the world’s most innovative and sophisticated companies. “Our team members interact with CEOs and have discussions about what’s happening in the market,” says Fowler, Global Research Vice President at Frost & Sullivan. “Our challenge is to create an engaging piece of marketing material that has a strong balance of research and marketability.”
Although Fowler focuses on hiring the best possible writers, best-in-class editing is essential to producing high-quality material. She had developed a peer review process, but it took a substantial amount of time and was not always objective. Fowler needed a solution that met her team’s high standards as efficiently as possible.
The solution to streamlining quality control
Fowler deployed Grammarly to her writing team for an initial pilot. When she saw how effective it was, she integrated Grammarly as a mandatory part of the content production process. This not only ensured that every writer on her team was getting the same objective feedback, but it also did so in an incredibly time-efficient manner. Peer reviews are still an important part of the process, but now, Fowler knows that the content hits their high readability standards before someone else steps in to review.
“If we can cut 300 hours down to 180 hours, that person can go from six projects a year to 12 projects a year. It’s all about scale.”

Less time editing, more great content
Thanks to Grammarly, the Frost & Sullivan writing team reduced its editing time by 66%, saving approximately two hours for every client story that they produce. With less time spent on manual editing, the team significantly increased its output. “If we can cut 300 hours down to 180 hours, a writer can go from six projects a year to 12 projects a year,” Fowler says. “It’s all about scale.”
What’s more, since Grammarly reduces repetition, flags awkward phrasing, and makes suggestions for clarity and concision, the quality of the writing produced by Fowler’s team has increased. “I am so nit-picky about passive voice, and it is rarely in our reports anymore,” Fowler says. “That’s the Grammarly effect.”
