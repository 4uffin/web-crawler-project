Oh wow. Leicester nearly pinched the lead at the end of the first half. Shannon O'Brien turned and lofted a ball into the box for the onrushing Asmita Ale, who had made a good run from left-back. However, Gemma Bonner gets across to make the block.

A little bit of desperation from Liverpool's Marie Hobinger as we enter the final five minutes of the first half. Stranded on the edge of the box, she hits a hopeful shot but drags her effort well wide.

More top work up front from Aston Villa. Kirsty Hanson is in down the right but can't generate enough power to beat Hannah Hampton from a tight angle.

Grace Geyoro is on the sidelines warming up for London City. She's got a lot of work to do to turn things around if she comes on in the second half.

Ebony Salmon should do better there. Ellie Carpenter totally mistimes a pass back and Salmon takes advantage, but she can't find a way to get round the goalkeeper and Hannah Hampton gets her hands to the ball.

Aston Villa deserve that. What I don't want to see is them sit back and allow Chelsea get back into the game now.
