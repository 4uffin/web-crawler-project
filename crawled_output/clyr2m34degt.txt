It's been coming. They've had the majority of possession. Beth England plays a ball over the top and there's nobody near Jess Naz.It's a bit too easy for Olga Ahtinen, who slots it into the bottom of the corner.

The visitors take the lead!Tottenham have been the better side and the goal is deserved.Olga Ahtinen presses high up the pitch to dispossess the Everton defender before playing a one-two and receiving the ball inside the box.It's then a comfortable finish to beat Courtney Brosnan.

This season a player like Jess Naz, it's time for her to step up now. There's only been a couple of signings for Tottenham, so she's a player who has to step up.

It's not been a thriller, this, so far.Probably not the start Everton would have liked at their new home.

It's all gone a little bit flat here.Both sides scrapping for the ball and trying to work openings but there hasn't been much that's clear-cut.

It's Beth England causing Everton problems, as she drops into midfield and Everton aren't picking her up. They need a player to track her. It's that communication they need.

Goodison Park actually plays a pretty important role in the history of women's football.It was here that more than 53,000 fans came to watch a women's charity match between Dick, Kerr Ladies and St Helens Ladies in 1920.But it was that match that caught the attention of the FA, who decided the game of football was "quite unsuitable for females" and banned women from playing football a year later.That capacity crowd was a record at the time for a women's football match and a record that stood for 99 years.It feels pretty fitting that the stadium now belongs to the women's team.

Spurs are getting a lot of luck down the wings.Their end product, though, still leaves a bit to be desired. Another cross comes in but nothing comes of it.

At the moment Spurs are so high that the defenders have to split wide, and that allows Ruby Mace to come in and get on the ball.

It's good pressure from Tottenham. They're moving the ball quickly. With the rain that we've had, it's good to get these shots hard and low.

Great stop from Courtney Brosnan! Drew Spence is waiting in front of goal and tries to tap the ball past the Everton goalkeeper from a yard or so out, but Brosnan gets down to her left and pushes the ball onto the post.

Ruby Mace is best in that central area for me. Last week she brought energy. It will be interesting to see her this season. She's a young player with lots of potential. Hopefully, she gets her chance here at Everton.
