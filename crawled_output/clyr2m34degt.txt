Interesting line-up from Chelsea. No Cuthbert is always a concern, no Baltimore who has hardly been out the team. Walsh and Kaptein hmmmð¤. Would love to see Sam Kerr on the pitch at some point, even just a short cameo.Scott

manager Gareth Taylor said there were many âpositivesâ to take from his sideâs
opening game of the season, despite suffering a heavy defeat to Everton Liverpool
took the lead through Cornelia Kapocs in the 12th minute but went on
to lose 4-1, including conceding three goals in 15 minutes either side of
half-time. Taylor felt
the result was âharshâ and was particularly happy with his sideâs performance
in the first 40 minutes. "You
don't always get what you maybe deserve," said Taylor. "I'm not
saying we really deserved to win that game but I don't think we deserved what
we got. I think we'll play worse in the future than we did in the first half
and win the game."I felt
there was something to grab hold of in that first 40 minutes performance.
Dominated the game, really controlled the game in the manner I felt was
deserving. I felt the scoreline was harsh on us, particularly when you look
into the statistics."I think
there's a lot of positives there. They are a really honest bunch of players and
it's really exciting because the buy in from then has been on top. It's always
about seeing signs of what you want to see in the future. Hopefully our
supporters could see lots to be excited about."

Image source, Getty ImagesLeicester are
aware of the threats posed by Liverpool but will âplay with no fearâ, says interim
boss Rick Passmoor. Leicester are
searching for their first win of the season after suffering a 4-0 defeat to
Manchester United last weekend while Liverpool lost 4-1 to local rivals
Everton. But Passmoor,
who only took the reins when Amandine Miquel was sacked less than a fortnight
before the start of the season, says âthe result will not define usâ as Leicester are still a team in transition. âBoth teams
have had a change in management and will be looking to step forward and,
long-term, produce in the season. The result will not define us,â Passmoor
said. âAt this part
of the season, itâs gaining momentum in the game and making the most of that.
Teams are still learning and players are still working off triggers and eachâs
other behaviours on the pitch. âYouâll see
passion from both teams. âIf you look
at parts of the Everton game, they caused problems and had pace on the front
line. Weâve got to be aware of their threats. Weâre going to respect every opposition
but play with no fear.â

Leicester did the double over Liverpool in their debut WSL campaign (2022-23) but have won just one of their four league meetings since.
Liverpool have lost three of their last four away games against Leicester in all competitions.
Last season, Leicester won 85% of their points (17/20) at home - the highest proportion in the league.
Liverpool's Marie Hobinger has three goal involvements in her last six league appearances (one goal, two assists) - as many as she managed in her previous 15.
Leicester have only scored 21 league goals since the beginning of last season. Liverpool have scored 23.

Aston Villa have lost each of their 10 WSL meetings with Chelsea; only Tottenham Hotspur have faced a team more often in the competition without ever taking a single point, losing 11 out of 11 games played vs Chelsea.
Chelsea have won each of their five Womenâs Super League away games against Aston Villa by an aggregate score of 15-0, keeping nine clean sheets in 10 overall meetings with the Villans in the top flight.
Chelsea have lost just one of their last 18 matches away from home in the WSL (W15 D2), losing 4-3 at Liverpool in May 2024. The Blues have won their opening away game in just one of the last seven campaigns (D4 L2), although that came last season via a 7-0 victory at Crystal Palace.

Speaking in her pre-match news conference, Aston Villa boss Natalia Arroyo sayid her side have "nothing to lose" against Chelsea today.âI probably prefer that [facing an unbeaten side] than facing a team that is losing all of their games because you have less pressure. We have this nothing to lose feeling around, maybe because of the media, the fans and the expectation on the opponent. We are not here competing for the title, they are.âWe need to face this knowing that it is our first game at home. This is the toughest opponent that we can face but itâs a challenge where we want to show ourselves to see how much we need to grow and how ready we are. We will try to play a competitive game without fear but with a lot of respect because theyâre super-good. We have our tools to make them feel uncomfortable.â

This game is sandwiched between a two-legged Champions League qualifier against Brann for Manchester United.They lost the first leg 1-0 in midweek and host the Norwegian side in the second leg on Thursday.Reds boss Marc Skinner said his side need to show "mental resilience" today, like they needed in the first leg of their Champions League tie."I think it will be a difficult game," Skinner said. "I said it to our players after the [Brann] game, and I'll say it again this morning, it's about mental resilience in this game."We have the quality to unlock them, and they have the quality to unlock us, so I think we have to utilise their crowd, utilise everything against us, and then try and be clinical where possible."We have have to be clinical. We have to be ruthless."

Chelsea manager Sonia Bompastor says it is "never easy" to play Aston Villa and they are a team who are "well organised" and can hurt opponents in transitions.Speaking in her pre-match news conference, Bompastor said: "Every game is important in this league, we all know that. The game is three points, the same as City. Every game matters, we want to make sure we perform in every game. "Aston Villa is never an easy place to go and to play. I know Aston Villa will be extra motivated to play Chelsea as always. We also want to focus on ourselves and what we can bring to the game to make sure we have a chance to win. We need to be clinical and efficient to score goals and solid defensively."

London City Lionesses manager Jocelyn Precheur to Sky: "The main reason is obvious, we meet our fans again, so it's a very good moment after more than four months to meet again. And it's an extra motivation for us to show the best version of ourselves on the pitch today and make them proud."On the test facing them today: "It will be a tough game. We talk about a team from the top four, such a big club, such a good team. That's why it's a very exciting game for us, another chance to show where we are, see if we improve, compare last week."At home many fans like this, fans who have been there for a very long time, new fans also. We have to seduce them, convince them, make them proud. If you don't give your best today, it will be a problem with me."
