It's the final ball that's letting Everton down. Their centre-halves need to be braver on the ball. They're 2-0 down, they need to take risks.

Everton are lacking the final ball. Maz Pacheco tries to find Katja Snoeijs but overhits her pass and it goes behind.

Ornella Vignola goes down the left and tries to send the ball into the middle, but it's not a well-timed cross and Lize Kop catches.

Ahtinen had a really good first half. She scored the goal, was drifting around on the left side, and Everton didn't know how to pick her up.She can be happy with her afternoon's work.

Really good from Kop - she has to watch it all the way. A good driven shot from the edge of the area from Ruby Mace. It was deflected and was probably going on target.

That's probably the closest Everton have come to a goal. And it wasn't anything special.Ruby Mace hits it from range, it takes a massive deflection on the way which removes all the power, and Lize Kop pushes it out.

It's looking very promising for Tottenham. Defensively, they have looked very solid. Martin Ho likes creative football and energy, but defensively they look very strong.

Tottenham continue to push for a third goal as they send another corner into the box, but Bethany England can't add the touch of quality and fails to hit the target with her header.

Kelly Gago is trying to be the catalyst. She's back there defending, wins the ball back, and is busting a gut to get up the pitch. But the quality of the pass isn't there.

Everton have to move the ball quicker. The Tottenham front line is pressing when they can and making it difficult for Everton to play through.

Everton are playing with a bit more impetus now that they've got a bigger hurdle to overcome.They're still not troubling the visitors much, though.

We see the passion from Gago. Really good play and showed good strength, though she was lucky not to give away a free-kick

Better from Everton. Kelly Gago gets in behind an cuts the ball back to Yuka Momiki, but her shot is blocked and goes behind for a corner.

According to Opta, that strike had an expected goals value of 0.02.One of those where you usually get a speculative effort which goes nowhere near. Not this time.

I knew as soon as she hit that, she hit it so true and first time. Brosnan is back-pedalling and can't get a hand to it. Again, it's Beth England with that aggressive front-foot press, who wins it back and plays it back to Tandberg. Great vision to see Brosnan off her line. That's a sucker-blow for Everton.
