Liverpool had 23 crosses in the first half - far more than usual - and that is part of Burnley's plan. Their tactics have worked - they don't want Liverpool to play through them so they have condensed the middle, and left the space out wide.That forces Liverpool into putting crosses in, and Burnley boss Scott Parker is thinking well we have two big centre-halves, so who is going to get on the end of them for Liverpool?You can hear more from Murphy on MOTD at 22:30 BST on BBC One and the BBC Sport website and app.

Another change for Liverpool as Alexis Mac Allister, who did take a heavy hit in the first half, is replaced by Conor Bradley. He will slot into right back so Dominik Szoboszlai is back in midfield.

I have yet to see anything with Florian Wirtz justifying the huge amount Liverpool paid for him, he just doesn't look a Premier League Player.StephenWirtz is getting forward in good positions but someone needs to get on the end of it. All it takes is one chance.JohnnyBurnley doing well. Liverpool will pick up the pace in the 2nd half. If the Clarets keep their heads they can nick or point or three here.Andy

Florian Wirtz swipes at the ball inside the box. It is a terrible shot but almost a great assist, but it is just out of Hugo Ekitike's reach.

Hugo Ekitike is not far off finding the far corner from the tightest of angles. I think it was a ball across the face of goal, but it really was not far off going in.I've brought him into my FPL team, by the way, so that will mean no goals or assists for him. Just a heads up.

For it to be done before half-time I think there is some injury. Yes, Milos Kerkez has got a yellow card, but he has not mistimed a tackle. He must have picked up some injury.

Burnley have their first corner of the game. Quilindschy Hartman's delivery is cleared by Virgil van Dijk and Liverpool then break through Mohamed Salah, but his cross is a poor one and floats behind for a goal kick.

The Reds have won seven away top-flight games in a row against three teams previously: West Brom (8 between 1983 and 2009), Norwich (8 between 1995 and 2021) and Crystal Palace (7 between 2016 and 2022).Liverpool are looking to win their opening four Premier League matches in a season for a third time, also doing so in 2018-19 (finished 2nd) and 2019-20 (won the title). It would be the third time in a row the reigning top-flight champions have won their first four games (also Man City in 2023-24 and 2024-25), the first time ever in top-flight history thatâs happened.Burnley have already shipped 37.5% of their total league goals from 2024-25 (16) in the Premier League this season (6). If they concede two in this game, itâd be the joint earliest in Football League history a side had already conceded 50% or more of their goal tally from the previous campaign, with Portsmouth in 1987-88 shipping 15 goals in four games, 54% of their previous seasonâs tally (28).Burnley won four of their first seven Premier League matches against the reigning champions (D1 L2) but theyâve since lost 10 of their last 11, conceding 30 goals in those 10 defeats. The exception in this run was a 1-0 away win at Liverpool in January 2021.Liverpool have scored in 37 consecutive Premier League matches, their longest run in top-flight history. Only Tottenham (39 in a row, March 2023 â March 2024) and Arsenal (55, May 2001 â November 2002) have scored in more Premier League matches in a row.Burnley have scored with none of their 15 attempts in the first halves of Premier League matches this season, but in the second half of games theyâve netted with four out of 12 shots, the best conversion rate after the break of any side (33%).This will be Burnley manager Scott Parkerâs first Premier League match against Liverpool since losing 9-0 with Bournemouth back in August 2022. He has beaten the Reds before however, a 1-0 win in March 2021, and could become the second manager to beat both JÃ¼rgen Klopp and Arne Slot in the Premier League, along with Marco Silva.Liverpoolâs Florian Wirtz has made the most off-ball runs in the Premier League this season (92), while heâs also made the most runs into the attacking third (42) and most runs ahead of the ball (26).Alexander Isak is set to make his Liverpool debut in this match â between 2022-23 and 2024-25, only two players scored more Premier League goals than he did (54). Two players (Hugo EkitikÃ© and Rio Ngumoha) have scored on their debuts this season, with 1946-47 the last time more Reds player scored on their top-flight debuts in one campaign (Len Carney, Billy Liddell, Albert Stubbins, Cyril Done, William Watkinson).HomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCBBC emails for youAdvertise with usCopyright Â© 2025 BBC.
