The Reds have won seven away top-flight games in a row against three teams previously: West Brom (8 between 1983 and 2009), Norwich (8 between 1995 and 2021) and Crystal Palace (7 between 2016 and 2022).Liverpool are looking to win their opening four Premier League matches in a season for a third time, also doing so in 2018-19 (finished 2nd) and 2019-20 (won the title). It would be the third time in a row the reigning top-flight champions have won their first four games (also Man City in 2023-24 and 2024-25), the first time ever in top-flight history thatâs happened.Burnley have already shipped 37.5% of their total league goals from 2024-25 (16) in the Premier League this season (6). If they concede two in this game, itâd be the joint earliest in Football League history a side had already conceded 50% or more of their goal tally from the previous campaign, with Portsmouth in 1987-88 shipping 15 goals in four games, 54% of their previous seasonâs tally (28).Burnley won four of their first seven Premier League matches against the reigning champions (D1 L2) but theyâve since lost 10 of their last 11, conceding 30 goals in those 10 defeats. The exception in this run was a 1-0 away win at Liverpool in January 2021.Liverpool have scored in 37 consecutive Premier League matches, their longest run in top-flight history. Only Tottenham (39 in a row, March 2023 â March 2024) and Arsenal (55, May 2001 â November 2002) have scored in more Premier League matches in a row.Burnley have scored with none of their 15 attempts in the first halves of Premier League matches this season, but in the second half of games theyâve netted with four out of 12 shots, the best conversion rate after the break of any side (33%).This will be Burnley manager Scott Parkerâs first Premier League match against Liverpool since losing 9-0 with Bournemouth back in August 2022. He has beaten the Reds before however, a 1-0 win in March 2021, and could become the second manager to beat both JÃ¼rgen Klopp and Arne Slot in the Premier League, along with Marco Silva.Liverpoolâs Florian Wirtz has made the most off-ball runs in the Premier League this season (92), while heâs also made the most runs into the attacking third (42) and most runs ahead of the ball (26).Alexander Isak is set to make his Liverpool debut in this match â between 2022-23 and 2024-25, only two players scored more Premier League goals than he did (54). Two players (Hugo EkitikÃ© and Rio Ngumoha) have scored on their debuts this season, with 1946-47 the last time more Reds player scored on their top-flight debuts in one campaign (Len Carney, Billy Liddell, Albert Stubbins, Cyril Done, William Watkinson).HomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCBBC emails for youAdvertise with usCopyright Â© 2025 BBC.
