Yeah that’s the problem. Plastic solves a logistics problem, not a structural problem.Are your Twinkies stuck in a hot truck in Texas for a week? No problem!replyloktarogar 50 minutes ago

It doesn't _only_ solve long-term logistical problems. Plastics are used for things like takeout containers, drink cups and straws, amongst others - things that are only needed for a short time.replyPunchyHamster 46 minutes ago

All of those need to hold hot and wet things for long enough without contaminating them.replyloktarogar 25 minutes ago

Agree, but I don't see any mention of that in the article, so I don't have enough information to argue for that.I'm sure we can agree though that having 17-day decomposing plastics that don't contaminate with heat and water is a good thing, so I hope it is that.replylazide 17 minutes ago

Is your shipment of drink containers stuck in a hot truck in Texas for a month? No problem! They’re plasticreplyloktarogar 28 minutes ago

My point is it doesn't have to be a complete solution to replacing plastic to be able to have some benefits to replacing some plastics.You can have local manufacturing processes so that it doesn't have to get stuck in a truck in Texas for a month.And there'll still be uses for the long lived plastics. You don't have to use one plastic for everything - like we don't today.Building a box that can last for centuries when you're only going to use it for 25 minutes and toss it is pretty wild if you think about it.replyred369 26 minutes ago

I don't know much about this area at all, but it seems like it would be neat to have a plastic that stood up well to heat and moisture, but you could leave it soaking in some petrol/diesel/oil liquid, and it would melt into that and leave you with something still useable.As I write this, it sounds like I'm just describing something like petrol in a solid form at room temperature. Perhaps there's something a little less far-fetched that people are working towards?replyars 10 minutes ago

> it sounds like I'm just describing something like petrol in a solid form at room temperatureThat's what plastic IS. That's why it sounds like it, because plastic is in fact solid hydrocarbon.So not only is it not farfetched, it exists today, which is also why incinerating plastic for energy is the best possible way to dispose it. You remove the plastic from the world, you reduce the amount of oil pumped for fuel, and you get to use the oil you do pump, twice! Once for plastic, and again for fuel.It's one of those environmental slam dunks with zero downsides. (Before you ask: Modern incinerators do not release any toxins from burning plastic, none.)replypar1970 1 minute ago

Petrol is really quite harsh and includes cancerous chemicals like benzene in sizable quantities. It’s not something you can soak something in and then use to expose to food.Diesel and other oils tend to be (somewhat) less bad - but there are many oils in food which are nearly identical, and hence anything which breaks down in those situations is likely to breakdown while in food contact too.replysenthil_rajasek 32 minutes ago

I would kill for this for when I’m buying fresh produce at the shops. Right now I just raw dog the produce into my basket as putting 4 apples into a plastic bag to ease the weighing and transport home seems like a selfish thing to do to the environment, but something that starts to break down soon after that sounds great.replynielsbot 0 minutes ago

the places around here are using compostable plastic bags. not sure what it's made of but it can be composted in municipal facilities according to the bag. one downside is they are green tinted and harder to see what is in there but if it removes some of the plastic killing the ocean then i'm for it... assuming it's not a plastic that degrades into microplastics.replythrow101010 2 minutes ago

Most of these at least in my region are made from cornstarch. They decompose well/without "microplastics" but only under correct conditions.Home composts aren't usually meeting these, their temperature isn't going high enough for full decomposition and you can have traces of polymers left behind. I throw them in the trash for compostable waste because thankfully my collectivity collects these to generate biogas and my guess is they do end up in much larger/managed composts where they can fully decompose.replykjkjadksj 9 minutes ago

Compostable plastics don't compost if you just throw them in a compost heap, you need to compost them in high-temperature conditions.replyars 13 minutes ago

> but if it removes some of the plastic killing the ocean then i'm for itIt doesn't. The plastics in the ocean don't come from your grocery store. They come from fishing gear and from places without municipal trash service.Honestly? It's basically greenwashing, it doesn't actually do anything at all. No one ever composts this things, and landfilling or incinerating a bag does not harm the environment.replyhedora 19 minutes ago

The plastic bag also prolongs the life of the produce, which is the main reason I want it.Wasting produce is much worse for the environment than wasting a bag. After all if you don't litter the bag, throwing it out is pretty harmless.replygerdesj 24 minutes ago

This is a novel material with a set of properties and a production "story" that looks rather cool - recycled vines.If those parameters meet the requirements for a material that you need to use then cool.
Use it.
I don't see any attributes in this article, which is fine but "stronger than ..." is a bit weak.The biodegradeable thing is probably going to be key if this stuff can hold hot liquids without poisoning the imbiber or can make plackey bags without falling to bits within seconds.replyweaksauce 12 minutes ago

That is neat, but not breaking down quickly is why we use it so often and why we find it so useful. We already have and use a ton of cellophane, but stores and producers avoid it in favor of plastic because plastic doesn't meaningfully degrade in the store or warehouse even if climate control conditions are shitty.replycmrdporcupine 1 hour ago

I'm skeptical that new materials like this will meaningfully drive down the demand for virgin plastic packaging. The problem is not just the absence of good alternatives; it's the fact that plastic is the fossil fuel industry's backup plan for the global transition to cleaner energy sources.That is: in preparation for a decrease in global demand for energy from fossil fuels, the industry is ramping up production of plastic to compensate so that it can maintain profitability (instead of, you know, just slowing down the extractive capitalism). Plastic production is set to triple over the next few decades as new facilities are built to support this transition.(Source: Paraphrasing from my vague recollection of A Poison Like No Other by Matt Simon, and also articles like this one https://www.ecowatch.com/plastic-production-pollution-foreca...)replyquotemstr 1 hour ago

> grapevineThe headline is practically a demonic summoning ritual for the naturalistic fallacy. The article is talking about cellulose. We've had cellulose forever. Cellulose is dirt cheap. We are a post-cellulose-scarcity civilization. Extracting it from grapevines ought to be mocked as our century's version of bringing coal to Newcastle.There's a reason we don't use cellulose packaging for everything and it has nothing to do with grapes.Hint: moisture exists in the world. Biodegrading in 17 days usually means that it breaks down a lot sooner in conditions we care about.> Funding for this research was provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Institute of Food and Agriculture and the National Science Foundation.What useful research could we have funded instead?reply542458 1 hour ago

The argument, which doesn't seem insane, is that this film is useful because it is particularly optically clear and strong, which are not properties I would have expected from cellulose. I agree 17 days is too short, but that seems like an interesting opportunity for future research. I would highlight that the number is 17 days when buried in wet soil, not sitting around on a shelf. Cardboard will break down when buried in wet soil, yet we use it extensively in packaging without issue.replyDemocracyFTW2 1 hour ago

> grapevine waste is a concern, and why it’s a particularly effective source of cellulose.We have markets and prices. If cellulose became scarce enough that the cheapest source for it became agricultural waste, we wouldn't need the government to fund research into an extraction process. Industry would be all over it on its own.State funding for research is there to solve the problem of industry incentives being aligned against foundational, long term research. What we're looking at here isn't anything like that. It's just one more organic extraction process, another entry in a long tradition of such things.replyArch-TK 1 hour ago

We don't have a good mechanism for waterproofing cellulose without various complicated industrial processes. Finding a way to do that would be interesting research.But anything involving grapeviles is just ecomasturbation.Actually, no, it's worse, because it robs attention and funding from real problems. Plastic pollution isn't predominately plastic bags or (plastic straws for that matter) that seem important because the sort of person who writes articles on a laptop for online publication encounters them daily and doesn't see the stream of untreated industrial waste mostly from the big rivers in Asia.IMHO, the best investment in mitigation of plastic pollution would be automatic cleanup mechanisms, especially for microplastics in the ocean.replyhedora 11 minutes ago

In fairness, those industrial waste streams are mostly produced by “recycling” facilities for consumer waste.The whole plastic straw thing is nuts.
The old waxed paper straws were fine.
The new “paper” straws are coated in PFAS and way worse for your health and the environment than most alternatives.This article reminds me of that.
Cellulose isn’t a new technology, but, like wax paper straws, it’s apparently forgotten arcane knowledge.replyAfterHIA 1 hour ago

I don't think there are good or bad wine growing regions as much as there are places where people have figured out how to make good wines.
