Based on an unbelievable true story, Roofman follows Jeffrey Manchester (Channing Tatum), an Army veteran and struggling father who turns to robbing McDonald's restaurants by cutting holes in their roofs, earning him the nickname: Roofman. After escaping prison, he secretly lives inside a Toys "R" Us for six months, surviving undetected while planning his next move. But when he falls for Leigh (Kirsten Dunst), a divorced mom drawn to his undeniable charm, his double life begins to unravel, setting off a compelling and suspenseful game of cat and mouse as his past closes in.

Mark Hanson
Slant Magazine
The real Jeffrey Manchester may in fact have been polite, but Derek Cianfrance’s film doesn’t convince you that it needed to be as well.
Rated: 2/4

Tim Grierson
Screen International
The film tries so hard to paint Jeffrey as an endearingly flawed curiosity that he lacks the rough edges or mystery that would make such a person compelling.

David Rooney
The Hollywood Reporter
This is the kind of disarming crowd-pleaser for which cringe-inducing clichés like “it will sneak up and steal your heart” were invented. What’s refreshing about Roofman is that it’s never too aggressive about it. It’s sentimental but sincere.

Roofman has changed my perception of Tatum and proven that he’s more than just comedic relief.
Rated: B

Carla Renata
The Curvy Film Critic
Whether watching Tatum play like a kid in the store or running naked for his life,  Roofman will have you cheering for the criminal, knowing that, sometimes, justice lies outside the tidy boundaries of the law.

Exclaim!
The persistence — and insistence — of highlighting Manchester's geniality eventually grows to a point that feels like an attempt to excuse the crimes he committed.
Rated: 6/10
