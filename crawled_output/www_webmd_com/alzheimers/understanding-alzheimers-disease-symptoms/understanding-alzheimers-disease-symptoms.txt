It eventually impairs your ability to do daily basic tasks. TheÂ symptoms of Alzheimer's disease often come on slowly over several years. There are different symptoms at each stage of the condition.Alzheimer's is one form of dementia. Dementia is a broad term to describe a decline in mental function, and Alzheimerâs is a specific disease underneath that umbrella. Different types of dementia can have similar symptoms, and itâs also possible to have more than one type at a time, so it can be hard to know if what you have is Alzheimerâs.Â Alzheimerâs is the most common form of dementia, accounting for more than two-thirds of cases in people older than 65. Memory loss that gets worse over time is a hallmark of the disease.Early Alzheimerâs disease symptoms might start when someone has trouble recalling things that just happened or putting thoughts into words. Over time, the problems get worse. People in the later stages of the disease usually canât live alone or care for themselves.There are three main phases ofÂ Alzheimer's: mild, moderate, and severe. Each stage has its own set of symptoms.Â Mild Alzheimer's Disease SymptomsThe first stage of the condition usually lasts from 2 to 4 years.Â The early signs of Alzheimer's include:Having less energy and drive to do thingsLess interest in work and social activities, and spending more time just sitting, watching TV, or sleepingLoss of recent memories, such as forgetting conversations and events that just happenedLanguage problems, such as trouble putting thoughts into words or understanding othersMild coordination problems, such as trouble writing or using familiar objectsA hard time with everyday tasks, such as following a recipe or balancing a checkbookMood swings that involveÂ depression or a lack of interestTrouble with driving, such as getting lost on familiar routesDiseases that mimic Alzheimer'sWhen a person has one or a few of these issues, it doesnât necessarily mean they have Alzheimer's. There are other medical conditions that can cause the same problems, such as:Conditions that affectÂ metabolism, such as aÂ thyroid problem. These conditions are typically treatable, and the cognitive symptoms usually get better once the disease is under control.Â Drug abuse. If your loved one is misusing drugs or alcohol, especially if this is a long-held habit, they may have cognitive problems that look like Alzheimerâs disease. You may notice certain physical signs with substance abuse, like more frequent injuries and falls, high blood pressure, or problems sleeping.TakingÂ medications that donât work well together.Â Review medications with a doctor â including any supplements â to be sure the mixture isnât causing problems with mental skills.Â Parkinson's disease.Â AlthoughParkinsonâs disease is also a disorder that can affect thinking in later stages, the primary symptoms affect movement. You should notice more of these signs early on, such as tremor.Stress.Â Stress can crowd out your normal ability to think clearly. This should go away if you are able to reduce your stress, while cognitive problems with Alzheimerâs get steadily worse.Depression.Â Poor thinking ability and memory problems are very common symptoms of depression. Treatment for depression with counseling and perhaps medication typically reduces this issue.A doctor can check on these symptoms and do tests to know if a person hasÂ Alzheimer's or something else.Moderate Alzheimer's Disease SymptomsThis is whenÂ memory loss gets worse and starts to cause problems in daily life. This stage of Alzheimerâs disease symptoms can last from 2 to 10 years.Someone with moderateÂ Alzheimer's may start to forget details about their life, such as where they went to high school or when they got married. They may not recognize or remember family members and friends. They might also forget where they leave things and canât retrace their steps to find them.Other Alzheimerâs symptoms at this stage can include:Rambling speechTrouble coming up with the right words and using the wrong onesA hard time planning or solving problemsConfusion about time or place. They may get lost in places they have been before. Once they are there, they may not know how or why they got to that place.Not dressing for the weatherGetting angry or upset easily, sometimes lashing out at family or caregiversTrouble sleepingWanderingDelusions, such as thinking a caregiver is trying to hurt themSome people with moderate Alzheimerâs symptoms also become more aware that theyâre losing control of their lives. That can make them even more frustrated or depressed.Severe Alzheimer's Disease SymptomsThe third stage, also known as late Alzheimer's, is the most severe. It typically lasts 1 to 3 years.People in this phase might have some or all of these Alzheimerâs symptoms:Major confusion about whatâs in the past and whatâs happening nowTrouble expressing themselves, remembering, or processing informationProblems with swallowing and control of theirÂ bladder and bowelsWeight loss,Â seizures,Â skin infections, and other illnessesExtreme mood swingsSeeing, hearing, or feeling things that arenât really there, calledÂ hallucinationsInability to move easily on their ownPhysical Alzheimerâs Disease SymptomsThere are several physical symptoms someone with Alzheimerâs disease may have, such as:Balance problemsTripping and fallingDragging feet or shuffling when walkingWeak or stiff musclesTwitches or seizuresTrouble sitting or standingApraxia, the general term for a loss of voluntary motor functionIn the last stages of Alzheimerâs, the effects on the brain can result in physical symptoms such as:Inhaling food or liquid into the lungsFlu, pneumonia, and other infectionsFallsFracturesBedsoresPoor nutrition or dehydrationConstipation or diarrheaDental problems such as mouth sores or tooth decayEarly-Onset Alzheimerâs Disease SymptomsAlzheimerâs symptoms typically show up in later life, after age 65. When Alzheimerâs disease happens in someone younger than age 65, it's known as early-onset (or younger-onset) Alzheimerâs disease.Â There arenât many differences between early-onset Alzheimerâs disease symptoms and Alzheimerâs disease symptoms. You may notice you:Forget newly learned information or important datesAsk for the same information repeatedlyHave trouble solving basic problems, such as following a recipeLose track of the date or time of yearHave bouts of not remembering where you are and how you got thereHave issues with depth perception or other vision problemsHave a hard time joining conversations or finding the right word for somethingMisplace things and arenât able to retrace your steps to find themWithdraw from work and social situationsHave changes in your mood and personalityAlzheimerâs Brain vs. Normal BrainJust about everyone has minor memory glitches as they get older. If someone forgets a name or why they walked into the kitchen, that doesn't mean they have Alzheimer's. The main problem that defines the disease is trouble planning and handling day-to-day tasks, like paying bills, managing a checkbook, or using familiar appliances around the house.A typical brain shrinks some with age, but the neurons (nerve cells) in the brain arenât affected in large numbers. When you have Alzheimerâs disease, a number of neurons are damaged, stop working, and eventually die.Â These neurons tend to be in the parts of the brain involved with memory. Thatâs why the first and most prominent symptoms are related to remembering, thinking, and reasoning.In the later stages of the disease, the damage to the brain is more widespread, and it affects communication and the ability to do daily tasks.Â Is There a Test for Alzheimerâs?If you think you notice the signs of Alzheimerâs in yourself or a loved one, the best thing to do is to talk to a doctor. They can let you know what the symptoms mean and what your options are for treating them.Â  Although thereâs no single test that can give you a positive result for Alzheimerâs disease, new advances can help with early detection and treatment.Â One is as simple as a blood test to determine the presence or absence of proteins that may mean there are plaques linked to Alzheimerâs in the brain. Your doctor may also use:Neurological examsCognitive and functional assessmentsÂ Brain imaging (MRI, CT, PET)Â Cerebrospinal fluid testsThe combination of all this diagnostic information can help form a bigger picture for your doctor.Â TakeawaysAlzheimer's disease is a brain disorder and the most common type of dementia. The hallmark symptom is memory loss, but other symptoms are problems with sound thinking, judgment impairment, confusion, and behavior changes. Alzheimerâs disease has three stages: mild, moderate, and severe. Alzheimer's disease symptoms come on slowly and get worse over timeAlzheimerâs Disease Symptoms FAQsWhat are the three types of behavioral triggers in Alzheimer's? As Alzheimerâs symptoms progress, the disease can trigger behavior changes. These changes include agitation, which can cause:Â Physical or verbal aggressionGeneral emotional distressRestlessnessPacingShredding paper or tissuesYellingOther behavioral changes are delusions (firmly held beliefs in things are not real) and hallucinations (seeing, hearing or feeling things that are not there).When do Alzheimer's symptoms start?Most people with Alzheimerâs have symptoms after age 65. But a few have early-onset Alzheimerâs, which triggers symptoms in your 30s or 40s. Symptoms can be hard to spot in the early stages and are often mistaken for normal signs of aging.Â Do patients with Alzheimer's sleep a lot?Sleeping a lot is common with Alzheimerâs, especially in the late stages. As damage to your brain becomes more widespread, even simple actions like trying to understand whatâs happening around you become exhausting. As a result, you sleep more, even during the day.What is the top predictor of Alzheimer's?Although age isnât the cause of Alzheimerâs, itâs the strongest risk factor for the disease. After age 65, your risk of Alzheimer's doubles every 5 years. Another strong indicator that you could get the disease is a history of Alzheimerâs in your family. What is the life expectancy of a person with Alzheimer's?The life expectancy for someone with Alzheimer's disease is 8 to 10 years. If you receive the diagnosis in your 80s or 90s, the life expectancy falls. Some people with Alzheimer's do live longer, as much as 15 or 20 years.What happens if Alzheimer's is left untreated?Treatments for Alzheimer's are limited. There's no cure. It's a progressive disease, which means it gets worse over time. There are medicines that might improve symptoms temporarily or slow the disease's progress.What are some of the early signs of Alzheimer's?Early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease include loss of interest in work and social activities, lack of energy to do things, forgetting things that just happened, struggling to find the right word, and trouble with everyday activities such as driving.SourcesUpdate HistorySharePrintSOURCES:Alzheimer's Association: "10 Early Signs & Symptoms of Alzheimer's," "Principles for a Dignified Diagnosis," "Dementia-related behaviors," "What Are the Causes and Risk Factors of Alzheimer's and Other Dementias?"Helpguide.org: "Alzheimer's Disease."Alzheimer's Disease Research: "Alzheimer's Symptoms & Stages."National Institute on Aging: "About Alzheimer's Disease: Symptoms," "Understanding Different Types of Dementia," "What Happens to the Brain in Alzheimer's Disease?"Fisher Center for Alzheimer's Research Foundation: "Top 10 Alzheimer's Signs and Symptoms."Cleveland Clinic: "Alzheimerâs Disease," "Dementia."Mayo Clinic: âAlzheimerâs Disease.âSAMHSA Treatment Improvement Protocol (TIP) Series: "Treating Substance Use Disorder in Older Adults."OHSU Center for Womenâs Health: "Brain Fog vs. Dementia."Pathways Home Health and Hospice: "The Effects of Alzheimerâs on the Physical Body."UC Health: "Alzheimerâs Disease."Johns Hopkins Medicine: "Early-onset Alzheimer's Disease," "Stages of Alzheimerâs Disease."Alzheimerâs Society: "Is it typical for people with dementia to sleep a lot during the day?"Alzheimer's Society UK: "The later stage of dementia."Â  View privacy policy, copyright and trust info SharePrint View privacy policy, copyright and trust info Next In Diagnosis & StagesIs It Alzheimerâs or Normal Aging? 10 Early Signs of Alzheimerâs 7 Stages of Alzheimer's Disease Alzheimer's Disease: How Itâs Diagnosed Show more articles More on Alzheimer's DiseaseUnderstanding Alzheimer's Disease BasicsAlzheimerâs vs. Dementia: Understanding the DifferencesBrain Foods That May Help Prevent Dementia Recommended FEATURED Top doctors in , Find more top doctors on Search Related LinksAlzheimer's Disease NewsAlzheimer's Disease ReferenceAlzheimer's Disease SlideshowsAlzheimer's Disease QuizzesAlzheimer's Disease VideosAlzheimer's OverviewAlzheimer's SymptomsAlzheimer's CausesAlzheimer's DiagnosisAlzheimer's TreatmentAlzheimer's ComplicationsAlzheimer's PreventionFind a NeurologistAlzheimer's Disease MedicationsLiving with Alzheimer'sAging WellBrain & Nervous SystemDementiaDown SyndromeDrug Interaction CheckerFrontotemporal DementiaPalliative CareParkinson's DiseasePick's DiseasePoliciesPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyEditorial PolicyAdvertising PolicyCorrection PolicyTerms of UseAboutContact UsCareersNewsletterWebMD AppCorporateSite MapFor AdvertisersAdvertise with UsMarket Research Â© 2005 - 2025 WebMD LLC, an Internet Brands company.
