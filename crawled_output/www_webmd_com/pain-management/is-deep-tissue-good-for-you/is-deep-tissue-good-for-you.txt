A deep tissue massage may be described as a "next-level" massage â scuba diving versus a casual swim.Â Deep tissue massage is more than skin deep. Your muscles are lower in your body. Massage therapists use slower strokes and direct pressure to help relieve pain, stiffness, and tension.Â Â When you have regular tension or pain, bands of rigid tissue are normally to blame. These bands (or adhesions) can block blood flow and cause pain, limit movement, and increase inflammation. In a deep tissue massage, your therapist will work to break down these bands to relieve pain and help you to move your body with ease.Classic massage therapy is different from deep tissue massage. One focuses on stress relief and relaxation, while the other (deep tissue) helps you with a specific problem like pain, stiffness, limited movement, or an injury.Â Â What's the difference between a Swedish massage and a deep tissue massage?Â You may be surprised to know that there are more than 80 types of massage. These range from more relaxing (think spa day) types to more intense kinds for rehab or pain relief.Â  Swedish massage and deep tissue massage are two common types. So, what's the difference?Â Swedish massages are used for relaxation, to improve blood flow, and to relieve muscle tension. The intensity is gentle, with long, gliding strokes, along with some tapping and kneading.Â Usually, anyone gets them, especially if you're older, an athlete, or you're pregnant.Â Deep tissue massages are used for pain relief, especially for chronic or long-term pain. The intensity is vigorous. The strokes are slow, with your masseuse using their fingers, thumbs, and elbows. Usually, athletes, runners, and people who sit for long periods of time get deep tissue massages.What Happens During a Deep Tissue Massage?Massage therapists use their fingers, thumbs, or elbows to apply pressure. It is especially helpful for areas of your body that are subject to muscle tightness, like your neck, lower back, and shoulders. Some of the same strokes are used in classic massage. But with deep tissue, the pressure is deeper and concentrated on areas of tension and pain. Think of kneading bread.What Are the Benefits of Deep Tissue Massage?While deep tissue massage may not always feel as relaxing as other types of massage, the benefits may be worth it.Â  More research is needed to understand exactly how or why massage therapy may help.Â Some reported benefits include:Â Reduced pain and muscle tension.Â The No. 1 reason people get a massage may not be all that surprising. Studies show a whopping 94% of people believe massage can help with pain, and more than 30% say they have gotten a massage for that reason.Â Deep tissue massage targets deeper layers of muscles and connective tissues to relieve chronic pain and muscle tension.Â The American College of Physicians even lists massage therapy as a remedy for temporary back pain.Â Â Improved sleep.Â Some studies have suggested regular monthly massages can increase oxytocin (the feel-good hormone) and possibly decrease cortisol (the stress hormone). The combo can lead to a better mood and good sleep, especially for those with insomnia due to menopause or congestive heart failure. If you're sleeping better, you may see a decrease in depression or anxiety too!Â  Strengthened immune response.Â Can regular massages keep you from getting sick? One recent study showed an increase in white blood cells after a massage, which work to fight off viruses and infections.Â Other benefits may include:Breaking down scar tissueÂ Relieving constipation (especially post-surgery)Decreasing cancer pain in some patientsÂ Lessening fibromyalgia painÂ Improving appetiteÂ "It may seem like massage therapists are just rubbing, but we move with purpose," says Dionna Freeman of Los Angeles, a licensed massage therapist for 20 years. "I've seen people who couldn't move their neck side to side or were having trouble sleeping who now say they're doing so much better. It's not just a luxury. Massage can truly be therapy, or 'church for the body,' I like to call it."Â Talk to your doctor before seeing a massage therapist to ensure it's right for you.Deep Tissue Massage for AthletesDeep tissue massage can have big benefits for people who do endurance activities like long-distance running, swimming, or cycling. Athletes in general often use massage to treat their pain and stiffness. Sports massages are like deep-tissue massages, but they focus on muscles that get the most work when you play sports. Look for a massage therapist trained in sports massage to help loosen tight muscles and help you rebound from injury.Â  Deep tissue massage paired with stretching can help people who push their body often get relief from pain. Injuries are common for athletes, and massage can restore their bodies to top shape. Increased blood flow helps move more oxygen to joints and muscles, lessening pain and stiffness.Â Massage can also increase range of motion, allowing an athlete to improve their throw, for example. "Athletes have long realized if you don't feel well, you don't play well," says Freeman. "This mindset is good for everyone."Â Training and competitions can also take a mental toll. Massage may help athletes with sleep, stress before games, and overall well-being.What to Expect After a Deep Tissue MassageYou might be sore (just a little, or a lot) after a deep tissue massage. You may feel stiff or have something called DOMS, or delayed onset muscle soreness, which starts a few hours or days after your massage. This is all normal, especially if it's been a while since your last massage.Â There are a few reasons you might feel sore.Â Movement:Â Yes, you're lying down on a table, but your muscles are moving. Your massage therapist is doing all the work. The pressure and movements during a massage can break down knots and muscle fibers. This can make your body feel like you've been through an intense workout.Â Inflammation:Â If your body is already inflamed, like from an injury, a deep tissue massage can cause soreness.Â Dehydration.Â If you haven't had enough water in the days leading up to your massage, your muscles might ache.Â Tension.Â If you walked in with tight muscles in your neck, lower back, and shoulders, you could feel worse before you feel better. Your massage therapist works hard to get knots out, and that can lead to pain post-massage.Â Sensitivity.Â Your body is unique. Your response to a massage may differ from someone else's.Â So, what can you do?Â Before your massage.Â Drink lots of water, consider some light stretching, and do your research to find an experienced massage therapist. Consider using organizations like the American Massage Therapy Association.Â  During your massage.Â Speak up if you're uncomfortable. Your therapist can adjust the pressure, but you have to let them know. Try to relax and breathe, which can help send more oxygen to your pain spots.After your massage.Â You may not know how you'll feel until a day or so later. But there are a few steps to keep up your positive gain and limit the pain.Do your best to stay hydrated.Â Consider light stretching after your massage.Â Use hot or cold therapy. Heat can help relieve stiffness. Cold can reduce inflammation and pain.Â Take a warm bath or shower. The heat may help relieve soreness. Toss some Epsom salts into your bath to up the relaxation.Â Take over-the-counter pain medicationÂ Get some rest. Limit heavy exercise and give your body time to recover.Are There Risks to Getting a Deep Tissue Massage?Massage from a licensed therapist is generally safe. But there are risks.Â Deep tissue massage is not for everyone. In some cases, it can cause muscle tears, bone fractures, or even a stroke. If you have osteoporosis or certain types of cancer, you might be more at risk of these things. Talk to your doctor first if you are pregnant, take blood thinners, or have a blood clot or blood disorder.Â Who should not get a deep tissue massage? Hold off on scheduling a deep tissue massage before getting a green light from your doctor if you have the following conditions:Heart conditionsOpen wounds, fractures, or you are easy to bruiseHigh blood pressureDiabetesÂ History of seizuresÂ Deep tissue massage can make any of these conditions worse. Be sure to check with your doctor if you are pregnant. Massages can cause issues with your fetus. Children and teens may run into issues as their bones and muscles and still developing. And be careful if you're taking prescription medication.Â How often should you get a deep tissue massage?Massage experts suggest starting with a monthly massage and increasing or decreasing based on how you feel. You'll want to give your body and muscles enough time to heal after sessions. Do talk to your doctor before starting a massage program to make sure it's right for you.TakeawaysDeep tissue massage is different from other types of massage Deep tissue massage is often used for pain relief, if you're recovering from an injury, or if you want to be able to move around easier.Â You may have some soreness or pain after a deep tissue massage. But it doesn't mean it isn't helping.Deep Tissue Massage FAQsHow much does a deep tissue massage cost?An hour of deep tissue massage costs anywhere from $50 to $150. What you'll pay for a massage depends on where you get it, who's doing it, and what you add to your massage. An in-home massage is typically more expensive than one done in a spa, rehab center, or physical therapy clinic. Also, a therapist with more experience will cost more.Â  If you add things like hot stones or aromatherapy (lavender, chamomile, etc.), the cost can go up.Does deep tissue massage release toxins?There is little evidence that massage of any kind can release toxins. But deep pressure movements may relieve pain from lactic acid that hangs out in the muscles. The reason you might feel sore after a workout is because of the lactic acid released with activity. Massage may help move lymphatic fluid and reduce inflammation. Your lymph nodes (small nodules in places like your underarms or neck) work by filtering fluid in your body. Lymphatic massage (often included with deep tissue massage) can relieve pain and inflammation. For people who have had one or both breasts removed (mastectomy), deep massage of the lymph area can help.Can a deep tissue massage make you sickâ? Â "Any massage can make you feel sick, especially if you are dealing with health issues already," says Freeman. "Deep tissue is just that â deep. It increases blood flow to areas of your body and may cause some cramping or lightheadedness." Freeman and other experts suggest refraining from alcohol just before or just after a massage and drinking plenty of water.Can I play sports after a deep tissue massage?Most experts suggest a bit of rest after a deep tissue massage. For athletes, their game might be better after a deep tissue massage. Pitchers may feel they can throw farther with increased range of motion, for example.Â SourcesUpdate HistorySharePrintPhoto Credit: iStock/Getty ImagesSOURCES:National University of Health Sciences:Â "Deep Tissue Massage."Â Kaiser Permanente:Â "Massage Therapy."American Massage Therapy Association:Â "Consumer Views & Use of Massage Therapy."Â Annals of Internal Medicine:Â "Noninvasive Treatments for Acute, Subacute, and Chronic Low Back Pain: A Clinical Practice Guideline From the American College of Physicians."Â Cleveland Clinic:Â "Everything You Need to Know About Massage Therapy,"Â  "Why Does My Body Feel Worse After a Massage?"Â "How To Relieve Muscle Soreness After a Massage,"Â "Lactic Acid,"Â "Lymph Nodes."Benchmark Physical Therapy:Â "Scar Tissue Treatment Options."Dionna Freeman, licensed massage therapist, Los Angeles.American Massage Therapy Association: "Go for the Gold."St. John's Health:Â "What are the dangers of deep tissue massage?"Massage Magazine:Â "How Much Does Massage Therapy Cost on Average?"
