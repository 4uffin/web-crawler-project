Felson,Â MD on October 14, 2024What Causes Chronic Pain Syndrome?SymptomsGetting a DiagnosisTreatmentsWhen to Call a Doctor About Your Pain4 min readPain is your body's normal reaction to an injury or illness, a warning that something is wrong. When your body heals, you usually stop hurting.But for many people, pain continues long after its cause is gone. When it lasts for 3 to 6 months or more, it's called chronic pain. When you hurt day after day, it can take a toll on your emotional and physical health.About 25% of people with chronic pain will go on to have a condition called chronic pain syndrome (CPS). That's when people have symptoms beyond pain alone, like depression and anxiety, which interfere with their daily lives.CPS can be hard to treat, but it's not impossible. A mix of treatments like counseling, physical therapy, and relaxation techniques can help relieve your pain and the other symptoms that come with it.What Causes Chronic Pain Syndrome?Doctors don't know exactly what causes CPS. It often starts with an injury or painful condition such as:Arthritis and other joint problemsBack painHeadachesMuscle strains and sprainsRepetitive stress injuries, when the same movement over and over puts strain on a body partFibromyalgia, a condition that causes muscle pain throughout the bodyNerve damageLyme diseaseBroken bonesCancerAcid reflux or ulcersInflammatory bowel disease (IBD)Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)Endometriosis, when tissue in the uterus grows outside of itSurgery The roots of CPS are both physical and mental. Some experts think that people with the condition have a problem with the system of nerves and glands that the body uses to handle stress. That makes them feel pain differently.Other experts say CPS is a learned response. When you're in pain, you may start to repeat certain bad behaviorsÂ even after theÂ pain is gone or has lessened.CPS can affect people of all ages and both sexes, but it's most common in women. People with major depression and other mental health conditions are more likely to get CPS.SymptomsCPS affects your physical health, your emotions, and even your social life over time. The pain can lead to other symptoms, such as:AnxietyDepressionPoor sleepFeeling very tired or wiped outIrritabilityGuiltLoss of interest in sexDrug or alcohol abuseMarriage or family problemsJob lossSuicidal thoughtsSome people with CPS need to take more and more medicine to manage their pain, which can make them dependent on these drugs.Getting a DiagnosisYour doctor will ask you about any illnesses or injuries that might have started the pain. They will also ask other questions to learn more about the type of pain you feel and how long you've had it:When did the pain start?Where on your body does it hurt?What does the pain feel like? Is it throbbing, pounding, shooting, sharp, pinching, stinging, burning, etc.?How severe is your pain on a scale of 1 to 10?What seems to set off the pain or make it worse?Have any treatments relieved it?Imaging tests can show whether you have joint damage or other problems that cause pain:CT, or computed tomography.
