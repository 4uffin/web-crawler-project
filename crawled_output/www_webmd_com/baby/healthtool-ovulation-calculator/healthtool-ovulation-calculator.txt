Use this calculator to see when you may be ovulating to find your most fertile days. Typically, you can get pregnant during about 6 days each month. That's called your fertility window.Select the first day of your last period<September 2025>SunMonTueWedThuFriSat123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930Note: This tool should not be used alone to prevent pregnancy.

To get a better sense of when youâre ovulating, chart your basal body temperature and your cervical mucus. Use an over-the-counter ovulation predictor kit, ovulation tracking bracelet, or lab tests to check for hormonal changes before ovulation.Have sex oftenYour odds of getting pregnant are best when you have sex 1 to 2 days before you ovulate. But cycle length can vary. You may have an irregular cycle or miscalculate your ovulation date. Sperm can survive in your body for up to 5 days. To hedge your bets, have sex often starting 3 days before ovulation and continuing for 2 to 3 days after you think you've ovulated.Lie low after sex?It was long believed that you should stay in bed for at least 15 minutes after sex to give sperm a chance to reach the egg. But recent studies found no evidence to back up this claim.Maintain a healthy weightStudies show that weighing too little â or too much â may disrupt ovulation and cycle length and affect the production of key hormones. Doctors consider a healthy body mass index to be between 18.5 and 24.9. Staying fit with moderate exercise is fine, but this isnât the time to train for a marathon: Strenuous exercise can mess with your menstrual cycle, making it more difficult for you to conceive.De-stressResearch shows that stress may make it harder to get pregnant. Yoga, meditation, and long walks can help lower stress and improve your overall well-being.Manage medical conditionsIf you have a medical condition such as diabetes, asthma, or epilepsy, be sure itâs under control. Speak with your doctor about any prescription or over-the-counter medications you may be taking, since they might affect your chances of getting pregnant.Your partner's health matters, tooMore than 33% of fertility issues involve only the sperm-producing partner, and another 33% involve both partners. Either partner can improve their reproductive health by quitting smoking, limiting alcohol, eating healthy, and lowering stress.Trying for a boy or a girl?Several theories claim you can influence the gender of your baby by having sex at a certain time of the month or in a specific position. But thereâs no surefire, natural way to choose the sex of your baby. Your odds are 50-50 unless you use a sperm-sorting technique, followed by artificial insemination.Learn MoreGetting Started on Getting PregnantReady to start trying to conceive?
