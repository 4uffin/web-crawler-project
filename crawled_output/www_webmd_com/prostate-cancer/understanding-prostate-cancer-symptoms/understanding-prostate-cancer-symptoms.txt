You canât feel the growing tumor pushing against anything else, so thereâs noÂ pain. You can have the disease for years and not know it. Thatâs why regular prostate cancer screenings are so important.If youâre a Black man, early screening for prostate cancer is particularly important as youâre 2.5 times more likely to die from prostate cancer than your non-Hispanic white peers. In a large study by JAMA Oncology, results pointed to factors such as access to quality health care as to why this may be the case.Â If youâre nonbinary or gender expansive, you should still be aware of potential risks of prostate cancer, particularly for transgenderwomen. Significant studies are lacking, but it is still possible to be diagnosed with prostate cancer. So screening, especially if you have symptoms or a family history of cancer, could be a helpful decision.Â
Symptoms of Prostate CancerOnce a tumor causes yourÂ prostate gland to swell, or onceÂ cancer spreads beyond your prostate, you may have symptoms including:The need to pee often, especially at nightTrouble starting or stopping a stream ofÂ urineA weak stream or one that starts and stopsLeaking pee when you laugh orÂ coughNot being able to pee standing upPain or burning when you peePain or burning when you ejaculateLess fluid when you ejaculateBlood in your urine orÂ semenPressure or pain in your rectumPain or stiffness in your lower back, hips, pelvis, or thighsNew trouble getting an erectionThese arenât symptoms of the cancer itself. They happen because the cancer growth is blocking your prostate.Symptoms of Advanced Prostate CancerSymptoms of advancedÂ prostate cancer include:Dull, deep pain or stiffness in your pelvis, lower back, ribs, or upper thighs; pain in the bones of those areasLoss of weight and appetiteFatigue,Â nausea, or vomitingSwelling of your lower limbsWeakness orÂ paralysis in your lower limbs, often withÂ constipationBowel problemsOther Prostate ConditionsThese symptoms donât always mean you have prostate cancer. Some other conditions may have similar signs.Prostatitis. This is often aÂ bacterial infection that causesÂ inflammation of your prostate gland. At least half of men will have it at some point.Â Medications can treat it. Prostatitis symptoms include:Trouble peeingBurning, stinging, or pain when you peeAn urgent need to pee oftenChills andÂ feverLower back pain or body achesPain in your lower belly or groin, or behind your scrotumPressure or pain in your rectumSexual problemsPain when you ejaculateBenign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). This is anÂ enlarged prostate because of unusual cell growth that isnât caused by cancer. Signs of BPH include:Trouble starting a urine streamPeeing often, especially at nightFeeling like yourÂ bladder hasnât fully emptied after you peeA strong or sudden urge to peeWeak or slow urine streamA urine stream that stops and starts several times while you peePushing or straining to start a urine stream Bladder infection. Your bladder holds your urine. The organ is located directly above your prostate. Some bladder cancer symptoms can overlap with those for prostate cancer. They may include:Blood in your urinePain or burning feeling while you urinateAn urgent or frequent need to urinate, even if your bladder isnât fullWaking up at night to urinateErectile dysfunction. This condition makes it hard for you to get or keep an erection. Itâs also called impotence. The main signs of erectile dysfunction is not being able to get an erection or to keep it long enough to have sex.Urinary tract infection (UTI). This can happen when bacteria grow in your bladder orÂ kidneys. Some infections are caused by BPH blocking the flow of urine out of your bladder. Doctors treat them withÂ antibiotics.Â UTI symptoms include:Needing to pee more than usual or more oftenA strong urge to peePain, discomfort, or burning when you peePain, pressure, or tenderness in your lower belly, side, or upper backUrine that looks cloudy or smells badFeverChillsNausea and vomitingManaging Prostate Cancer PainBack pain.Â This can happen if your prostate cancer spreads to bones in your back. It can make it difficult to walk. Over time, pain in this area can spread to other parts of your body.Â Nerve pain. If prostate cancer presses on a nerve in your body, you can feel this type of pain. The feeling can be described as shooting, burning, or tingling. Nerve pain can also cause an area to feel numb.Lymphedema.Â If your prostate cancer spreads to your lymph nodes, it can causeÂ lymphedema. This condition is caused by a blockage in your lymphatic system, which is part of your immune system. Fluids can build up and cause areas in your body to swell if your lymphatic system is blocked. Lymphedema pain from prostate cancer can affect your legs, but can also affect areas including the penis or scrotum. Affected areas are described as feeling achy, tight, or heavy.Â To help manage prostate cancer pain, you can:Keep a pain diary to show your doctorÂ Take pain-relieving drugs like bisphosphonatesStart treatment such as pain-relieving radiotherapyUndergo surgery to damaged boneTry complementary therapies, like acupuncture, reflexology, or aromatherapyManaging Other Prostate Cancer SymptomsÂ Other prostate cancer symptoms can include:Loss of libido (sex drive).Â Side effects of drug treatments for prostate cancer can cause a loss of interest in sex and erection problems. A common treatment for prostate cancer is hormone therapy, which is used to slow your body down from making testosterone, the male hormone. Your doctor may recommend you do hormone therapy off and on to lessen the side effects of these medications.To manage a loss of libido with prostate cancer, you can:Ask your doctor about breaks with your hormone therapy treatment, or only restart treatment when your prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels begin to riseTalk to your doctor about drug treatment for erection problemsSeek advice from a sex counselor or therapistTalk with your partner about loss of libidoKeep a healthy diet and stay activeDepression.Â News of cancer can be understandably difficult for you and your loved ones. Following a prostate cancer diagnosis, it isnât unusual for you to experience depression and other emotional side effects. Because stress is often another side effect of depression, depression in cancer patients has been linked to shorter survival times. To manage the effects of depression, it can be helpful to:Join aÂ support group for those with prostate cancer or in recoveryTalk to your doctor about changes in your mood and feelingsTalk to loved ones about what you are experiencingTry to remain activeCognitive impairment, or mental functions.Â The use of hormone therapy in prostate cancer patients can increase the risk of cognitive impairment. This is because lowered levels of testosterone, the male sex hormone, can affect concentation, thinking, and memory. You may forget a thought mid-sentence, have trouble remembering conversations, or struggle with complex decision-making, like handling bills or taking medications.Â To manage your thinking and memory, you can try to:Talk with your doctor about changes in your cognitive abilityKeep a journal to help with daily remindersUse sticky notes to keep track of tasksRepeat information back to people to ensure you fully understand what they saidWork on puzzles, like crossword or Sudoku, to keep your mind activeWhen to See Your Doctor About Prostate Cancer SymptomsTalk to your doctor if:You have trouble urinating or find that urination is painful or different from usual.
