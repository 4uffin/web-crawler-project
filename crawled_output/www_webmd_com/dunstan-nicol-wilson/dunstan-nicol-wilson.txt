Nicol-Wilson has a BSc in bioscience and an MSc in public health (global health). He has spent his career in research governance and is now a clinical project manager. In addition, he is also a freelance columnist and mentor. Nicol-Wilson began advocating for sickle cell anemia in 2018 through various talks, columns, and community outreach.

Outside of work and advocacy, he loves to travel, try new experiences, and spend time with friends and family. He can be contacted via Instagram and LinkedIn.Latest Blog Posts from
