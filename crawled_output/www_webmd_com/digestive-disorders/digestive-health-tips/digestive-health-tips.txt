The good news is there are some simple solutions for many of your troubles. Learn about what causes your discomfort, how to prevent and manage digestive problems, what questions to ask your pharmacist, and when to see a doctor.
You digestive system is made up of many organs.
The Digestive SystemHow does theÂ digestive system work?It may seem like digestion only happens in yourÂ stomach, but itâs a long process that involves many organs. Together they form the digestive tract.Digestion begins in your mouth, whereÂ saliva starts to break down food when you chew. When you swallow, your chewed food moves to yourÂ esophagus, a tube that connects your throat to yourÂ stomach. Muscles in the esophagus push the food down to a valve at the bottom of your esophagus, which opens to let food into the stomach.Your stomach breaks food down using stomach acids. Then the food moves into the small intestine. There, digestive juices from several organs, like yourÂ pancreas andÂ gallbladder, break down the food more, and nutrients are absorbed. Whatâs left goes through your large intestine. The large intestine absorbs water. The waste then moves out of your body through the rectum andÂ anus.Digestive problems can happen anywhere along the way.Gas and BloatingBloating andÂ passing gas can be uncomfortable and embarrassing. Hereâs what you need to know.What is gas?Gas is a normal part of healthy digestion. Air that is in your digestive tract is either released through yourÂ mouth as a burp or through your anus as gas. You typically pass gas 13 to 21 times a day.What causes gas?Gas is created when you swallow air, such as when you eat and drink. But itâs also a byproduct of the breakdown of food. Some foods cause more gas than others. You may also be more sensitive to particular foods and may have more gas when you eat them.Taking someÂ medications can also cause gas.Which foods cause gas?Youâve probably noticed you feel gassy after eating certain foods. Cut back on the common culprits:ApplesAsparagusBeansBroccoliBrussels sproutsCabbageCauliflowerMilk and dairy productsMushroomsOnionsPeachesPearsPrunesWheat What causes bloating?When gas builds up in your stomach andÂ intestines, you may have bloating â swelling in your belly and a feeling of fullness. It may happen to you more often if you have:A stomach infectionIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS). This digestive condition causesÂ stomach pain, cramping, and diarrhea orÂ constipation.Celiac disease. When people with this condition eat gluten, their bodies produce antibodies that attack the intestinal lining.Hormonal changes that happen around womenâs periodsConstipationWhile bloating is usually just uncomfortable, it can sometimesÂ cause pain in your belly or sides.How can I reduce gas and bloating?Diet and lifestyle changes can make a big difference:Cut back on fatty foods.Avoid fizzy drinks.Eat and drink slowly.Quit smoking.Donât chew gum.Exercise more.Avoid foods that cause gas.Avoid sweeteners that cause gas such as fructose andÂ sorbitol. They are often found in candies, chewing gum, energy bars, and low-carb foods.What OTC medicines treat excess gas?If you have a lot of gas or are very uncomfortable, an over-the-counter medicine may help.LactaseÂ supplements. If dairy is causing your problems, taking these tablets or drops just before you eat will help you digest lactose (the main sugar in dairy foods) and reduce gas.Alpha-galactosidase. This digestive aid comes as liquid or tablets. You take it before you eat to help your body break down the complex carbs or sugars that cause gas, such as those found in beans, broccoli, and cabbage. Caution: People with the genetic condition galactosemia should avoid it. It may also interfere with some diabetes drugs likeÂ acarbose (Precose) orÂ miglitol (Glyset). If you take medication forÂ diabetes, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking this aid.Simethicone (Mylicon).Â Taking these liquids or tablets can relieve the uncomfortable bloating and pain from gas.Probiotics. These supplements contain "friendly" bacteria that can help digestion. In addition to tablets and powders you sprinkle on your food, foods like yogurt, kefir, and sauerkraut containÂ probiotics.Heartburn/GERDWhat isÂ heartburn? Heartburn, sometimes called acidÂ indigestion, is a painful, burning feeling in the middle of your chest or the upper part of your stomach. The pain, which can also spread to your neck, jaw, or arms, can last just a few minutes or stick with you for hours.What causes heartburn?Thereâs a muscle at the entrance of your stomach, called the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), that acts like a gate: It opens to let food move from your esophagus to your stomach, and it shuts to stop food and acid from coming back out.When the LES opens too often or isnât tight enough, stomach acid can rise up into the esophagus and cause the burning feeling.WhatÂ triggers heartburn?Triggers vary from person to person, but you may be more likely to get heartburn when you:OvereatEat spicy, fatty, acidic, or greasy foodsConsume caffeine or alcoholSmokeLie down shortly after you eatAre under stress Who gets heartburn?Some people have a higher risk of heartburn, including those who are:SmokersOverweightPregnantHave aÂ hiatal hernia, where the stomach bulges up into the chest through an opening in the diaphragmHow should I change my diet to avoid heartburn?You might have noticed that your heartburn gets worse when you eat or drink certain things. Here are a few that canÂ trigger heartburn:AlcoholChocolateCoffeeFatty or fried foodsGreasy foodsOnionsOranges, lemons, and other citrus fruits and juicesVinegar, hot sauces, and salad dressingsPeppermintSodas and other bubbly drinksSpicy foodsTomatoes and tomato sauceBig meals can also set off heartburn. Instead of eating three big meals a day, try to eat several small meals throughout the day.What else can I do to prevent heartburn?Here are a few steps to try:Lose weight if youâreÂ overweight. Extra pounds put pressure on your stomach, forcing more acid up into your esophagus.Wear loose clothing. Tight clothes that press on your stomach can trigger heartburn.If you smoke, quit. Cigarette smoke relaxes the muscle that prevents acid from backing up into the esophagus. It also may increase how much acid your stomach makes.Check your medicines. Regular use of anti-inflammatory and pain medicines (other thanÂ acetaminophen) contributes to heartburn.Avoid high-impactÂ exercise. If heartburn bothers you at night:Eat a light dinner and avoid foods that trigger your heartburn.Donât lie down for at least 2 to 3 hours after you eat.Use blocks or books to raise the head of your bed by 4-6 inches. Or put a foam wedge under your mattress at the head of the bed. Sleeping at an angle will help stop acid from backing up into your esophagus.Can exerciseÂ cause heartburn?Exercise has more than a few health perks. Among them is weight loss, which can help you avoid getting heartburn in the first place if you are overweight. But some types of exercise can trigger the burning sensation. Youâll be less likely to reach for your heartburn medicine if you avoid crunches and inverted poses inÂ yoga. You may need to find alternatives to high-impact workouts. For example, bicycle or swim instead of going for a run.What is GERD?Everyone has heartburn from time to time. But when you have it frequently (at least twice a week for a few weeks), or when it begins to interfere with your daily life or damage your esophagus, your doctor may tell you that you have a long-term condition called gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD. Itâs also known asÂ acid reflux disease. Heartburn is the most common symptom of GERD. What are other symptoms of GERD?Besides the frequent burning in your chest, you might also have symptoms like:Bad breath or a sour taste in yourÂ mouth or in the back of your throatBreathing problemsCoughingFeeling like you have a lump in the back of your throatHoarse or raspy voiceNauseaDifficult or painful swallowingSore throatTooth decayVomitingIs it GERD or something else?Frequent heartburn is a symptom of GERD. Itâs important to get help if you have heartburn frequently so you can avoid complications from GERD and uncover any other problems. Call your doctor or make an appointment with a gastroenterologist, who specializes in digestive illnesses. Many of theÂ symptoms of heartburn sound like aÂ heart attack. If youâre not sure, call 911.What are the complications of frequent heartburn and GERD?Over time, heartburn that isnât treated or controlled well by lifestyle changes or medicine may cause serious problems, including:Breathing problems like asthma, nighttime choking, and repeated pneumoniaChanges in the cells that line the esophagus, called Barrettâs esophagus. This can possibly lead toÂ cancer of the esophagus.PainfulÂ inflammation of the esophagus calledÂ esophagitisNarrowing of the esophagus, called an esophageal stricture. This can cause problems swallowing. What medicines can I take to treat heartburn?Several types of over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription medicines can help with heartburn. Your doctor or pharmacist can help you find the one thatâs right for you.AntacidsWhat type of antacid should I choose?Soothe occasional, mild heartburn with an antacid that containsÂ calcium carbonate orÂ magnesium. They help neutralize stomach acid. Some prevent acid reflux. Those that contain magnesium may also help heal stomach ulcers. They come in liquids and pills and are fast-acting.What are the side effects of antacids?Antacids can causeÂ constipation and diarrhea. Look for brands that containÂ calcium carbonate, magnesium hydroxide, and aluminum hydroxide to reduce these side effects. Donât take antacids with magnesium if you have chronic kidney disease. Some antacids have a lot of salt, so you should take them only for occasional heartburn.H2 BlockersWhat do H2 blockers do?H2 blockers help relieve and prevent occasional heartburn by lowering the amount of acid your stomach makes. Though they donât work as fast as antacids, their effects last longer. Your doctor may tell you to take an antacid and an H2 blocker together. H2 blockers are for short-term use â less than 2 weeks. You can take them before your meals to prevent heartburn, or atÂ bedtime. They come in liquids and pills.All H2 blockers work about the same. So if one doesnât help with your heartburn, switching to a different one isnât likely to help. Switching to a higher-dose prescription version of the drug might help, though. Talk to your doctor if over-the-counter H2 blockers aren't working for you. Some H2 blockers can interfere with other drugs, including:Anti-seizure medicinesBlood thinnersMedicines forÂ heart rhythm problemsTalk to your doctor if you take any of these medicines and you need to take an H2 blocker.What are the side effects of H2 blockers?The most common side effects are mild and include:ConstipationDiarrheaHeadacheNausea or vomitingProton-Pump Inhibitors (PPIs)What are PPIs?PPIs are used to prevent frequent heartburn that happens more than twice a week. They work by lowering the amount of acid your stomach makes. Often, they work better than H2 blockers. You also can take these drugs for a longer period of time than H2 blockers.PPIs are available over the counter and by prescription. But if you have GERD, you may need prescription-strength medication.How do you take PPIs?You need to take PPIs once a day on an empty stomach so theyâll work best. Usually youâll take the medicine every morning, about 30 to 60 minutes before you eatÂ breakfast, to control stomach acid. Talk to your doctor before taking the PPI calledÂ omeprazole (Prilosec OTC) if you takeÂ clopidogrel (Plavix), a drug used to preventÂ heart attacks and strokes. Taking the two drugs may make clopidogrel less effective.What are the side effects of PPIs?The most common side effects are mild and include:DiarrheaHeadacheNausea and vomitingStomach painPPIs may also raise your chances of getting kidney disease, and fractures of the hip, wrist, and spine, and may lead to low magnesium levels. The risk is highest in people who take high dose PPIs for a year or more.Â ProkineticsWhat are prokinetics?Prokinetics help your stomach empty faster, so you have less acid left behind. Usually you take this medicine before meals and atÂ bedtime.Prokinetics are sold only by prescription.What are the side effects of prokinetics?Prokinetics can have more serious side effects than PPIs or H2 blockers. These include:AnxietyDepressionDiarrheaDrowsinessFatigueCrankinessNauseaIf Medicines Donât HelpShould I call my doctor? Yes. If your heartburn isnât getting better, your medicines cause side effects you canât tolerate, or you have other complications, you may need surgery. It is rare to need surgery for heartburn.What will my doctor do?Your doctor will ask about your symptoms and do an exam. It can be helpful to keep a journal to note what you eat and drink and when you have heartburn. This will help you and your doctor pinpoint your triggers.If medicine and lifestyle changes donât control your heartburn, you can take one of these tests to find out what's causing the problem:pH test.Â This measures the acidity of your esophagus. The doctor will either attach a small sensor to your esophagus or place a thin tube down your esophagus.Â Endoscopy.Â A long, thin tube with a camera and light on the end is put down your esophagus so your doctor can look inside your esophagus and stomach. Endoscopy can look for problems such as an ulcer or narrowing inside your esophagus. Barium X-ray.Â Youâll drink a liquid that coats the inside of your digestive tract. Then X-rays are taken, which will allow your doctor to see the outline of yourÂ digestive system.When is heartburn an emergency?Heartburn is usually a minor problem that goes away over time. But if you also have other symptoms, it could be a sign that something more serious is wrong. Call your doctor or go to the emergency room if:It hurts to swallow.You feel like youâre choking.You have black, tarry-lookingÂ bowel movements.Your mouth or throat hurts when you eat.You have difficulty swallowing foodsYour voice is hoarse.Your vomit containsÂ blood or what looks like coffee grounds.You have trouble breathing.Is it heartburn or aÂ heart attack?Heartburn doesnât affect yourÂ heart, but it can feel a lot like theÂ chest pain that happens during a heart attack. Call 911 if you have any of these symptoms along with chest pain, even if youâre not sure that youâre having a heart attack:DizzinessNausea and vomitingPain that travels to your neck andÂ shoulder, jaw, or backShortness of breathSweatingOver-the-Counter Heartburn ReliefType of medicineHow they workHow fast they start workingHow long the effects lastSide effectsAntacidsÂ They neutralize stomach acid.Within secondsUp to 3 hoursSome cause constipation and diarrhea.H2 BlockersÂ They lower the amount of acid your stomach makes.In about 30 minutesUp to 12 hoursThey may cause constipation, diarrhea,Â headache, nausea, or vomiting.Â Proton-Pump Inhibitors (PPIs)Â They lower the amount of acid your stomach makes.Up to 4 daysUp to 24 hoursThey may cause diarrhea,Â headache, stomach pain, nausea, or vomiting. They may also cause kidney disease, and fractures of the hip, wrist, and spineÂ Â ConstipationHow do I know if Iâm constipated?Whatâs considered a normal number of bowel movements varies from person to person. If you are straining when going to the bathroom, you are probably constipated. You may also have hard stools or a feeling that your bowel movement isnât complete.Occasional constipation is common, but if you have less than three bowel movements in a week, see your doctor. What causes it?There are many causes of constipation, and sometimes you have more than one:Not drinking enough waterEating a diet low in fiberTraveling or changing your routineGetting too little exerciseTaking certain medicines, such as antidepressants, antihistamines, iron, and some pain medications (particularly narcotic pain medications)Medical conditions including cancer, diabetes, IBS, and hypothyroidismPregnancyBlockages in the large intestineProblems with the nerves or muscles around the large intestine or rectumTaking too many laxativesWhen should I call my doctor?If you are constipated for more than 2 weeks, are losing weight, have blood in your stool, or you are having severe pain, see your doctor. These may be signs of a serious problem.How can I prevent and treat constipation without medication?Drink plenty of water (60-80 ounces per day). An extra two to four glasses a day may help.Eat prunes or bran cereal to get 20-35 grams of fiber per day.Eat more vegetables and fruit.Drink warm wateror herbal tea in the morning.Exercise often. What OTC medications can I take for constipation?When lifestyle changes donât solve your problems, there are several over-the-counter medications that can help. Talk to your pharmacist or doctor about which medicine is right for you. Be sure to read labels carefully before taking these medicines. Using some over-the-counter treatments for constipation for more than 2 weeks can make your symptoms worse and may be a sign of something more serious.Bulk-forming laxatives. You take these fiber supplements with water to bulk up your stool, which can trigger your bowels to push it out. Some common bulk laxatives areÂ methylcellulose, polycarbophil, psyllium, and wheat dextrin.Lubricants, like mineral oil. They coat the surface of the intestine and block water from being absorbed from the stool, which helps it pass more easily.Osmotic agents. These help keep more water in the intestine, which can expand the intestine and stimulate a bowel movement. Osmotic agents are not for some older adults and people with heart or kidney failure. Talk to your doctor before taking this type of medicine.Stool softeners. By adding fluid to stools, softeners help you avoid straining and make them easier to pass.Stimulants. These laxatives make the intestines contract, which helps move the stool.Suppositories or enemas. Some laxatives come in a form that can be inserted into the rectum. These are helpful when you have to avoid straining, such as after surgery or childbirth.HemorrhoidsWhat are hemorrhoids?Hemorrhoids are swollen blood vessels in the rectum and the anus, and they can be uncomfortable. They can be either inside the rectum (internal) or under the skin around the anus (external). Internal hemorrhoids usually donât cause discomfort, though straining to have a bowel movement may cause them to bleed or lead to spasms in the muscles of the rectum, which can be painful. External hemorrhoids itch and may bleed.What are the symptoms of hemorrhoids?Bleeding during a bowel movementItching around the anusSwelling or pain around the anusPainful or sensitive lumps around the anus If you think you have hemorrhoids, see your doctor. Bleeding can also be a symptom of something more serious.What causes hemorrhoids?Constipation or straining during bowel movements causes most hemorrhoids. You may also have hemorrhoids if you don't get enough fiber in your diet.Being pregnant or overweight can cause hemorrhoids because of the extra pressure on your rectum. Hormonal changes that happen during pregnancy can also weaken the muscles of the rectum and anus. Youâre also more likely to get them if you sit for long periods of time. And they're more common as you get older. Other causes include having diabetes, a past rectal surgery, and colon cancer.When should I call my doctor?If you think you have hemorrhoids, see your doctor. They can recommend treatment and make sure your symptoms are not caused by another condition.You should also see your doctor if your hemorrhoids havenât gotten better with treatment. You may need to see a doctor who specializes in hemorrhoids.How can I treat hemorrhoids without medication?Add fiber to your diet to help relieve constipation and make your stools softer. This will make it easier to have bowel movements and reduce the pressure on hemorrhoids.Try a stool softener.Exercise to help relieve constipation.Donât strain during bowel movements.Soak in a plain, warm bath or sitz bath (a few inches of water that covers your private parts and bottom) to help relieve the pain.Keep the area clean and dry.Use moist wipes instead of dry toilet paper so you donât irritate the area any further.Apply an ice pack or cold compress to help with swelling.Avoid spicy foods to prevent itching. Which OTC medications treat hemorrhoids?Medications include creams, suppositories, pads, and ointments. Most products contain witch hazel or hydrocortisone, which can help stop the itching and swelling and may ease pain. Most over-the-counter medications should not be used for more than a week. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about which is the best option for you.DiarrheaWhat is diarrhea?Diarrhea is loose, watery stool that sends you to the bathroom more often than usual. When you have diarrhea, you may have stomach pain and cramps or bloating.What causes it?Many things cause diarrhea, including viruses, bacteria, parasites, medications, and medical conditions that affect the stomach, intestines, or colon. What you eat can also be a culprit.When should I call my doctor?If you have occasional, mild diarrhea, there is probably no reason for concern. But if it lasts for more than 2 days and hasnât improved, you should call your doctor. If your infant or child has diarrhea, call your pediatrician. You should also call your doctor if you have diarrhea along with any of these symptoms:Severe belly or rectal painBloody or black stoolsFever above 102 FDehydration. Signs of dehydration include feeling very thirsty, having a dry mouth or skin, having little or no urine, having dark yellow urine, and feeling weak.How can I treat my diarrhea?Drink plenty of fluids (water, sports drinks, fruit juice) to keep from getting dehydrated. Avoid alcohol, caffeine, and dairy. If you arenât nauseated, you can eat plain, bland, low-fiber foods including bananas, plain white rice, toast, and crackers.As long as you donât have other symptoms that worry you, you may also try some over-the-counter treatments:Loperamide (Imodium): This comes in liquid and capsules. It works by slowing movement in your intestines and colon so you can absorb more water, making the stool less watery. Talk to your doctor about taking this medicine. Do not give it to children under 2.Bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol,Â Pink Bismuth): This medicine reduces mild diarrhea and comes in liquids, capsules, and chewable tablets. You shouldnât take it if youâre allergic to aspirin or have a fever. Donât give it to children under 2. If youâre taking a blood thinner, donât take this medicine before talking to your doctor.Probiotics: The same supplements that can help with bloating from gas may also help relieve some types of diarrhea by adding âgoodâ bacteria to your digestive system.How to Fix Digestive IssuesFiberFiber is a natural part of plants. There are two types. Both are important and work in different ways.Soluble fiber dissolves in water, turning into a gel. Think of it as a sponge, soaking up fluid. Soluble fiber can help with diarrhea, which happens when there is too much water in your colon. It also slows the emptying of your stomach so you feel fuller longer, which can help you lose weight.Sources include:ApplesCitrus fruitsLentilsNutsOatmealPsylliumInsoluble fiber doesnât dissolve in water. Think of it as a broom: It helps keep food and waste moving through your body. Because insoluble fiber attracts water in your gut, it makes stools softer and easier to pass. Eating a diet rich in insoluble fiber can help with constipation.Sources include:CarrotsCauliflowerLegumesPotatoesWhole grainsWomen should get about 25 grams of fiber per day. Men should get 38 grams.If you have trouble getting enough fiber from foods, your doctor may suggest you take fiber supplements. Drinking waterWater is essential to good health and normal bowel function. Water also helps keep stools soft but solid and well-formed. Avoid drinking beverages such as coffee or soda if you think they trigger your digestive problems.ProbioticsYour digestive tract is full of different kinds of bacteria. You may think that is a bad thing, but most of the bacteria in your gut are healthy. They break down toxins, help your body make some vitamins, and play a role in keeping you healthy. But when you have too much of some kinds of bacteria, you may get an illness or have unpleasant symptoms.Probiotics are like the healthy bacteria in your body. Eating foods that contain them, or taking probiotic supplements, can help keep a balance of good and bad bacteria in your body.Experts arenât sure exactly how they work, but probiotics may help:Relieve bloating from gasKeep you regularRelieve some types of diarrheaBoost your immunityFight infectionsPrevent harmful bacteria from growing in your stomachDestroy the bacteria that make you sickMake B vitamins your body needs Which foods contain probiotics?ButtermilkFermented and unfermented milkKefirKimchiMisoSauerkrautSome picklesSome soft cheesesSoy drinksTempehYogurt with live, active culturesShould I take a probiotic supplement?People with certain conditions shouldnât take them, and some probiotics may affect how well your other medications work. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about whether probioticsupplements are right for you.SourcesUpdate HistorySharePrintSOURCES:Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics: âItâs About Eating Right.âAHRQ: âTreatment Options for GERD or Acid Reflux Disease: A Review of the Research for Adults.âAmerican Academy of Family Physicians: âHeartburn,â âAntidiarrheal Medicines: OTC Relief for Diarrhea.âAmerican College of Gastroenterology: âAcid Reflux,â âProbiotics for the Treatment of Adult Gastrointestinal Disorders.âAmerican Family Physician: âEffective management of flatulence.âAmerican Gastroenterological Association: âUnderstanding Heartburn and Reflux Disease.âAmerican Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy: âUnderstanding Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease.âAmerican Society of Health-System Pharmacists: âCimetidine.âThe Consultant Pharmacist: âAntidepressant-mediated gastroesophageal reflux disease.âCanadian Society of Intestinal Research: âExercise helps pass gas.âCDC: âClean Hands Save Lives!âChildrenâs Hospital of Pittsburgh: âOrgans: small and large intestine.âCleveland Clinic: âProbiotics,â âHemorrhoids,â âHeartburn,â âGERD and Asthma,â âGERD,â âGas,â âThe Fiber Lifestyle,â âDiarrhea,â âConstipation.âFDA: âPossible Increased Risk of Bone Fractures with Certain Antacid Drugs.âHarvard School of Public Health: âHemorrhoids and what to do about them,â âFiber.âJournal of Neurogastroenterology and Motility: âGastroesophageal reflux disease and sleep disorders: evidence for a causal link and therapeutic implications.âInternational Foundation for Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders: âExercise & GI Symptoms.âAmerican Journal of Gastroenterology: âGuidelines for the diagnosis and management of gastroesophageal reflux disease.âNational Institutes of Health: âYour digestive system and how it works,â âSymptoms and Causes of Constipation,â âGas in the Digestive Tract,â âHemorrhoids.âNational Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute: âWhat are the symptoms of a heart attack?âNational Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases: âGastroesophageal Reflux (GER) and Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) in Adults.âThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists: âWomenâs Health: Problems of the Digestive System.âMayo Clinic: âRelaxation techniques: Learn ways to reduce your stress,â âFecal incontinence: Lifestyle and home remedies,â âDietary fiber: Essential for a healthy diet,â âDehydration.âNational Digestive Diseases Information Clearinghouse: âPreventing Travelerâs Diarrhea.âÂ Thompson, W.
