And as a young adult, maybe you scraped by on heavily salted instant noodles, rice, and beans. But as you get older, what you eat plays an extra important role in your overall health.Â Diet fads come and go. Low-fat this and sugar-free that line the shelves.

Carbs are naturally in many foods, such as fruits, veggies, and grains. These are often called âgood" carbs. Theyâre also added as sugars or starch to processed foods, such as sodas, chips, and candy. These are called âbad" carbs.Â Processed foods that have bad carbs are the worst for your health. They overload your body with extra sugar, starch, and other unhealthy stuff. By choosing natural alternatives, youâre giving your body healthier amounts of sugar, starch, and fiber.What carbs do. Good carbs have many jobs, including:Giving you energyLowering your chances of getting health problems like heart disease, obesity, and diabetesHelping you control your weightNumbers and CarbsGood carbs should make up about half of your daily calories.

To keep track of your numbers, read the "Nutrition Facts" on your food labels.Following a healthy diet after 50 doesnât need to involve number crunching and avoiding carbs completely.

These often have added sugar. You can replace them with sparkling seltzer water that has real fruit juice or with lightly sweetened teas.Â White bread. Simply substitute your normal sandwich bread for a whole grain or whole wheat option.Â Pasta. Like bread, opt for the whole-grain or whole-wheat types of your favorite pasta. Or use vegetables like zucchini and squash to make âveggie noodlesâ.Â French fries and potato chips. Even fat-free and low-sodium chips are packed with bad carbs. Chips made from sweet potatoes or black beans can be a healthier option. You can also make a variety of veggie chips at home.Cookies, cakes, and pastries. You probably wonât be shocked to know that the amount of sugar and butter in most baked goods is bad for you. Try satisfying your sweet tooth with fresh, frozen, or dried fruit.Candy, chocolate, and ice cream. As with baked goods, fresh fruit is a good substitute for these types of junk food. White rice. Itâs not as bad as other processed foods, but itâs not as healthy as whole-grain alternatives like brown rice or quinoa.Flavored yogurts. It takes a bit of extra work, but adding fresh or frozen fruit to your favorite plain yogurts will cut out a lot of the bad carbs that are in flavored yogurts.Â Sugary cereals. Most of these have a lot of bad carbs. Consider replacing sugary cereals with natural, whole-grain versions. Or switch to unprocessed oatmeal with fresh fruit.Shop CarefullyEven when youâre thinking about buying food thatâs labeled âlow fatâ or âsugar free,â always double-check the Nutrition Facts to understand what youâre getting.Â Choose a natural alternative when youâre considering a low-fat or sugar-free option.Â SourcesUpdate HistorySharePrintSOURCES:âHarvard Health Publishing: âThe smart way to look at carbohydrates.âHelpGuide: âEating Well as You Age.âHouston Methodist: âDonât Be Fooled by Low-Fat Foods.âMayo Clinic: âCarbohydrates: How carbs fit into a healthy diet.âMemorialCare: âYou Don't Have to Abandon Carbs in 2019.â View privacy policy, copyright and trust info SharePrint View privacy policy, copyright and trust info More on Healthy AgingWhat Your Body Needs as You AgeWhat Can Go Wrong With Your Feet As You AgeHelpful Tips to Care for Aging Parents Recommended FEATURED Top doctors in , Find more top doctors on Search Related LinksHealthy Aging NewsHealthy Aging ReferenceHealthy Aging SlideshowsHealthy Aging VideosHealthy Aging QuizzesHealthy Aging BasicsPreventive CareRelationships & SexFitness & ExerciseWeight Loss & Diet PlansScreenings and VaccinesEye HealthMenopauseDepressionHealth Insurance & MedicareCaregivingEnd-of-Life CarePoliciesPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyEditorial PolicyAdvertising PolicyCorrection PolicyTerms of UseAboutContact UsCareersNewsletterWebMD AppCorporateSite MapFor AdvertisersAdvertise with UsMarket Research Â© 2005 - 2025 WebMD LLC, an Internet Brands company.
