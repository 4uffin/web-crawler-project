But youâre probably wondering, what exactly is a healthy diet?âA healthy, balanced diet includes a variety of foods that provide all the essential nutrients your body needs to function well,â saysÂ Amy Kimberlain, MS, RDN, CDCES, a Miami-based registered dietitian and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.The major food groups and essential nutrients include:Fruits and vegetables (such as kale, spinach, broccoli, red peppers, berries, and citrus fruits)Proteins (found in chicken, fish, milk, and eggs)Healthy fats (found in avocado, nuts, salmon, tuna, and oils)Whole grains (such as oats, quinoa, and whole wheat bread)Vitamins (such as vitamins A, B, C, D, E, and K)Minerals (such as calcium, potassium, and iron)Water (both in what you drink and whatâs naturally in foods)Whether youâre dieting or not, everyone needs a mix of nutrients, ideally from foods, because they include what your body needs to stay healthy. According to Kimberlain, a general rule to follow is to:fill half your plate with fruits and vegetablessplit the other half between whole grains and lean proteinadd in a healthy fat and drink water with your mealÂ  Itâs important to remember that everyone has different nutritional needs, so your plate may look different than your friendâs, Kimberlain says. âEach person will have individualized goals based on various factors, like age, activity level, and health goals, so itâs important to discuss them with a registered dietitian or nutritionist to create an individualized plan based on their needs,â she says.Â A good resource to plan meals isÂ MyPlate, which makes it easy to map out just how much of each food type to include.
A healthy, balanced diet is made up of a wide variety of foods that provide all the essential nutrients, which include fruits and vegetables, proteins, healthy fats, whole grains, vitamins and minerals, and water. Everyone has different needs with nutrition. Working with a dietician can help you reach the best plan for your individual needs. (Photo Credit: ljubaphoto / Getty Images)
Healthy Foods to Lose WeightâTo use healthy foods for weight loss, focus on nutrient-dense, high-fiber meals that keep you full and satisfied,â Kimberlain says. The best way to eat healthy foods is to think about what you need to add to your diet instead of restricting yourself, she says. Exactly how many calories you should get per day depends on your goals, your age, your sex, and how active you are. Cutting your calories too much can make your diet hard to stick with and may not give you the nutrients your body needs. A dietitian can help you figure out the right plan for you. Other helpful tips include:Drink water as your main beverage.Â Choose nonfat or 1% milk instead of 2% or whole milk. Plant-based milk, like soy or almond milk, is also a great choice.Â Pick lean meat instead of fatty meat.Select breads and cereals that are made with whole grains.Replace saturated fats with unsaturated fats, like olive oil, avocado, nuts, seeds, when you can. Omega-3s, which you can get from fatty fish, flaxseeds, and walnuts, are especially good fats.Don'tÂ  feel that you have to completely avoid all foods that have fat, cholesterol, or sodium. It's your average over a few days, not in a single food or even a single meal, that's important.Check the food labels on packaged foods to help you budget fat, cholesterol, and sodium over several days.Cook at home to manage what youâre eating. Have healthy snacks on hand, like baby carrots, fruit, and yogurt, so you choose them instead of processed and packaged foods. Make a shopping list and donât go to the grocery store hungry.Keep added sugar and salt to a minimum.Â In addition to eating healthy, aim to move more, get good sleep, and reduce stress, Kimberlain says.Â Â Calories and Their Role in Weight LossCalories are a measurement, like an inch or a tablespoon. They note how much energy is released when your body breaks down food. The more calories a food has, the more energy it can provide to the body.When you eat more calories than you need, your body stores the extra calories as fat. Even low-carb and fat-free foods can have a lot of calories that can be stored as fat.Â Try to be mindful of your portion sizes and listen to your hunger cues to help you eat what you need to stay full between meals, Kimberlain says.Â If you eat a high-calorie food or meal, balance your intake by choosing low-calorie foods the rest of the day or the next day. Also, itâs best that you donât skip meals, as that can cause overeating at your next one.Â Protein and Weight LossProteins help repair and maintain your body, including muscle. You can get protein in all types of food. Good sources include fish, meat, poultry, eggs, cheese, nuts, beans, and other legumes.Eating Fat and Losing WeightYour body needs some fat. But most Americans get too much of it, which makes high cholesterol and heart disease more likely.There are several types of fats:Saturated fats. These are found in cheese, meat, whole-fat dairy products, butter, and palm and coconut oils. You should limit these. Depending on whether you have certain health conditions like high cholesterol, heart disease, diabetes. A dietitian or your doctor can let you know your limit.Polyunsaturated fats. These include omega-3 fatty acids (found in soybean oil, canola oil, walnuts, flaxseed, and fish, including trout, herring, and salmon) and omega-6 fatty acids (found in soybean oil, corn oil, and safflower oil).Monounsaturated fats. These come from plant sources. Theyâre found in nuts, vegetable oil, canola oil, olive oil, sunflower oil, safflower oil, and avocado.Cholesterol. This is another type of fat found in foods that come from animals.Trans fat. Some trans fat is naturally found in fatty meat and dairy products. Artificial trans fatsÂ have been widely used in packaged baked goods and microwave popcorn. Theyâre bad for heart health, so avoid them as much as possible. Although trans fats are less common in recent years, you can still lookÂ at the nutrition facts label to see how much trans fat is in an item. Know that something that says â0 g trans fatâ may actually have up to half a gram of trans fat in it. So, always check the ingredients list: If it mentions âpartially hydrogenatedâ oils, those are trans fats.Carbs and Weight LossCarbohydrates give your body fuel in the form of glucose, which is a type of sugar. Some research suggests at least 25% of total daily carbs in your diet is needed to get the energy your body needs.The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend getting about 45% to 65% of total daily calories from carbohydrates.Â Most Americans eat too many carbohydrates, especially processed carbs, which can lead to obesity, prediabetes, and diabetes.Some carbs are rich in nutrients. Those include whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and legumes. Other carbs are sugary and starchy, and not high in nutrients, so you should limit those. These include candy, pastries, cookies, chips, soft drinks, and fruit drinks.Vitamins and Weight LossVitamins help with chemical reactions in the body. In general, vitamins must come from the diet; the body doesnât make them.There are 13 essential vitamins. Your body can store vitamins A, D, E, and K, and it can be a problem if you get too much of them. Vitamin C and the B vitamins donât build up in your body, so you need to keep getting them regularly in your diet.MineralsLike vitamins, minerals must come from the diet. Your body needs them, but it canât make them.You need more of some minerals (such as calcium, potassium, and iron) than others. For instance, you need only small amounts of the minerals zinc, selenium, and copper.Water Intake and Weight LossWater has no calories or nutrients, but it keeps you hydrated. It also makes up about 50%-70% of body weight. You can drink water or get it from foods that naturally have water in them, like fruits and vegetables.Are smoothies healthy?How healthy a smoothie is depends on how you make them. âSmoothies can be created to be more satisfying and nutrient-dense, depending on the portion size and ingredients used,â says Kimberlain.Â To increase your smoothieâs benefits you can try mixing in:Protein (like Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, nuts, and nut butter).Fruit (fresh or frozen adds good nutrients and natural sweetness).Vegetables (such as leafy greens, which add nutrients without changing the taste)Milk or a plant-based alternative (like oat milk).Â Â Â Â Â Healthy Eating Plan for Weight LossAim to build all three of your meals around the essential nutrients you need every day, including lean proteins, fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats. Try to mix up the colors on your plate and the types of food youâre eating to get a wide variety of nutrients. The best general guideline is to fill half of your plate with fruits and vegetables and split the other half between lean protein and whole grains.Â Â âThe best meals share a few key traits: balanced, satisfying, nutrient-dense, and calorie-conscious without being restrictive,â Kimberlain says.Â Â Here are a few meal plan ideas and foods to add to your plate based on nutrients youâd like to add to your diet:Lean proteins, which are a filling and muscle-building source of foodBreakfast - eggs or nonfat yogurtÂ Lunch - sandwich with turkey and low fat cheeseDinner - grilled chicken or tofu, fish, or beansÂ Fruits and vegetables, which are high in fiber and nutrientsÂ Breakfast - spinach and bell pepper omelette or scramble with a side of berries or citrus fruitsLunch - salad with spinach or kale, turkey sandwich with bell peppers and tomato, with baby carrots and hummus on the sideDinner - steamed or roasted broccoli, bell peppers, and zucchiniWhole grain carbohydrates, which give you lots of energy for your dayÂ Â Breakfast -whole-grain toast or oatmealLunch - whole-grain sandwich bread or brown rice as a base for your mealDinner - a side of sweet potatoes or quinoaHealthy fats, which help your food taste better and help you stay full between mealsÂ Breakfast - eggs with olive oil, avocado toastÂ Lunch - leafy green salad with avocado and oil-based salad dressingsÂ Â Dinner - salmon or tuna, prepared with olive oilÂ TakeawaysA healthy, balanced diet is made up of a wide variety of foods that provide all the essential nutrients, which include fruits and vegetables, proteins, healthy fats, whole grains, vitamins and minerals, and water. Everyone has different needs with nutrition. Working with a dietician can help you reach the best plan for your individual needs.Weight Loss FAQsWhat is the healthiest meal for losing weight? There isnât a single âhealthiest mealâ for weight loss, but the best meals are âbalanced, satisfying, nutrient-dense, and calorie-conscious without being restrictive,â Kimberlain says.Â What is the best diet plan for weight loss? Itâs best to aim for slow weight loss versus quick results. Try to choose one healthy habit, like eating more lean protein or walking a mile a day, and add that into your life before moving onto the next small goal. Little by little, it will add up to major wins, she says.Â Â How to lose 10 kg in 10 days? It might be possible to lose 10 kg in 10 days, but itâs not recommended. The weight loss will probably be temporary and quick-fix diets often work because you lose water and muscle mass, whereas you really want to be burning fat and keeping (or building) your muscles.Â  What is the 30-30-30 rule for weight loss? The 30-30-30 plan involves eating 30 grams of protein within 30 minutes of getting out of bed and then exercising for 30 minutes through cardio. The idea is that it may help you stay full for longer and feel more energized, but thereâs no research to support this approach.Â Â Â SourcesUpdate HistorySharePrintSOURCES:U.S. Department of Agriculture.Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics: âProtein and the Athlete -- How Much Do You Need?âCDC: âProtein,â âSaturated Fat.âFDA: âQuestions and Answers Regarding Trans Fat.âAmy Kimberlain, MS, RDN, CDCESNational Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases: "Food Portions: Choosing Just Enough for You."
