Mikstas,Â RD,Â LD on May 09, 20253 min readAmino Acids. The building blocks that make up proteins. Humans need 21 different amino acids to function properly. Some are made by the body. Others, called essential amino acids, must be obtained from foods.Antioxidant. Substances, like vitamins A, C, E, and beta-carotene, that protect your body from the damage of oxidation caused by free radicals.Botanicals. Substances obtained from plants and used in food supplements, personal care products, or pharmaceuticals. Other names include âherbal medicineâ and âplant medicine.âDaily Value. Found on food and drink nutrition labels, this number tells you the percentage of the recommended dietary allowance provided by one serving of the food or drink in question.Fat Soluble Vitamins. The fat-soluble vitamins are A, D, E, and K. Your body stores excess fat-soluble vitamins in your liver and body fat, then uses them as needed. Ingesting more fat-soluble vitamins than you need can be toxic, causing side-effects like nausea, vomiting, and liver and heart problems depending on the vitamin. Fortify. To increase a food or drink's nutritional value by adding vitamins, minerals, or other substances. For example, milk is fortified with vitamins A and D.Free Radicals. An atom or molecule with at least one unpaired electron, making it unstable and reactive. When free radicals react with certain chemicals in the body, they may interfere with the ability of cells to function normally. Antioxidants can stabilize free radicals.Herb. Herbs are plants used as flavorings and spices in cooking, but herbs can also be used as supplements for health or medicinal reasons.Megadose. Supplements that provide more than 100% of the daily value of the body's required vitamins and minerals.Micronutrients. The name given to certain vitamins and minerals that your body needs only in small amounts.Â Micronutrients are vital to your body's ability to process the "macronutrients:" fats, proteins, and carbohydrates. Examples are chromium, zinc, and selenium.Minerals. Nutrients found in the earth or water and absorbed by plants and animals for proper nutrition. Minerals are the main component of teeth and bones, and help build cells and support nerve impulses, among other things. Examples include calcium and magnesium. Multivitamin. A pill, beverage, or other substance containing more than one vitamin.Oxidation. A chemical reaction in which oxygen combines with a substance, changing or destroying its normal function. Oxidation can damage cell membranes and interfere with a cell's regulatory systems, but it is also part of our normal-functioning immune system.Phytochemicals. Compounds found in fruits, vegetables, and other plants that can be health-protecting. Phytochemicals (sometimes called phytonutrients) include beta-carotene, lycopene, and resveratrol.Prenatal Vitamins. Specially formulated multivitamins that ensure a pregnant woman gets enough essential micronutrients. Prenatal supplements generally contain more folic acid, iron, and calcium than standard adult supplements.Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA). The amount of nutrients needed daily to prevent the development of disease in most people. An example is vitamin C; the RDA ranges from 15 to 120 milligrams depending on age and sex.Supplements. Vitamins, minerals, herbs, or other substances taken orally and meant to correct deficiencies in the diet.U.S. Pharmacopeia (USP). A nonprofit authority that sets standards and certifies supplements that meet certain quality, strength, and purity standards, some of which are called the Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). Many supplements carry the USP symbol on their label. Vitamins. Naturally found in plants and animals, vitamins are vital to growth, energy, and nerve function. There are two types of vitamins used by the body to support health: fat-soluble and water-soluble.Water-Soluble Vitamin. Water-soluble vitamins like B-6, C, and folic acid are easily absorbed by the body. Your body uses the vitamins it needs, then excretes excess water-soluble vitamins in urine. Because excess amounts of these vitamins are not stored in the body, there is less risk of toxicity than with fat-soluble vitamins but a greater risk of deficiency.SourcesUpdate HistorySharePrintSOURCES:Harvard Health Publications: "Online Medical Dictionary."FamilyDoctor.org: "Vitamins and Minerals: What You Should Know" and "Fat-Soluble Vitamins."Mayo Clinic: "Dietary Supplements: Using Vitamin And Mineral Supplements Wisely" and "Percent Daily Value: What Does It Mean?"AIDS Community Services of Western New York, Inc.: "HIV/AIDS Glossary."WebMD Medical Reference provided in collaboration with Cleveland Clinic: "Pregnancy: What You Need to Know About Prenatal Vitamins."WebMD Medical Reference from Healthwise: "Amino Acids" and "Free Radicals."National Institutes of Health.
