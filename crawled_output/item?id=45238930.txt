So for those who, like me, wonders why Apple keeps getting macOS Unix certified, it's to avoid a lawsuit. Apple misused the Unix trademark when they first launched MacOS, so to avoid legal trouble with The Open Group, Terry Lambert was put in charge of getting MacOS Unix compliant and certified: https://www.quora.com/What-goes-into-making-an-OS-to-be-Unix...It's basically the only relevance the Unix trademark has these days. I can't imagine many companies choosing macOS because it's a real Unix, nor would anyone really opt out of z/OS, AIX og HPUX, if they where not certified.replyajdude 3 hours ago

> I can't imagine many companies choosing macOS because it's a real Unix, nor would anyone really opt out of z/OS, AIX og HPUX, if they where not certified.While Unix compliancy isn't what's keeping me on macOS, the Unix tools it has under the hood still is. I've opted to use it over Linux because I still get everything that I need from a "Unix like" standpoint while having some serious enterprise level support and compatibility with work software that's often only available for windows or Mac.If Apple stopped caring about being Unix compliant, I wouldn't be surprised to see the tools and infrastructure that make it Unix (and useful to me) slowly be removed. Then I'd stop using it.replymdasen 3 hours ago

I'd say that you care about it being UNIX-like, not UNIX®. You don't care that Linux isn't UNIX. You don't care that GNU versions of things like ed and awk are slightly off-spec.In some ways, Apple's adherence to UNIX specifications probably makes macOS less useful for you. For example, I wish that grep on macOS was closer to GNU grep. When I look up commands online, I often find answers based on the GNU implementations. Those often work on macOS, but sometimes don't (or have subtly different behavior) because macOS is adhering to the UNIX specification rather than to what those utilities do on the vast majority of systems out there.I don't think Apple would be removing UNIX-like tools from macOS even without certification. They know how valuable it is that most developers use their systems. Even Microsoft went so far as to implement the Windows Subsystem for Linux for developers. At this point, I think that UNIX certification makes macOS less compatible with the tools and help out there which generally targets Linux. Usually the differences are small, but they certainly can be meaningful.replylucideer 2 hours ago

It's not for everyone, but at some point I got tired of the FreeBSD layer being there but not cared for, and WSL+git for windows kinda provides a decent compromise in that regard.The thing I hated the most was spending time building installation scripts or running images for the prod environment, and then go fight macos to replicate the same setup locally. Especially having parralel installs for the system and my user account was a PITA.One would argue I could just dev on the docker image as well, but then being on a somewhat unixy OS doesn't matter much anymore.WSL let's the Windows side live it's life (shell level tools can still be injected for convenience), and the linux side be genuinely Linux, not some ersatz, and duplicable to one's heart content. It's still less pain and better perfs than straight docker, and just extremely well integrated in general.replyzitterbewegung 2 hours ago

While macOS only really gets Unix certified they design of the flavor of unix from FreeBSD. Homebrew is also the best port system and package manager I have ever used because it requires no thinking. I actually dislike using Linux because now I have to learn the replacement from ifconfig, the creation of launchd IMHO is way better than init.d and systemd, and the command line diskutil and other additions still feel like its more Unix like while Linux feels like its moving toward its own thing. Before I was using macOS I was using OpenBSD as my daily driver since high school. I still don't understand though why Ubuntu has the ability to break /boot because there isn't enough space to add another kernel to there...replyStopDisinfo910 2 hours ago

The initial argument was that MacOS is nice because it has the core Unix tool. I find this baffling because MacOS has very little to do with a traditional Unix apart from the certification and the core utils are literally usable on approximately anything.Speed bumps regarding what?I’m mostly using Linux nowadays but when I have to use Windows, the experience is fairly ok. The tooling when you want to manage it is imho superior to what Apple provides. I’m not used to develop on it but I have seen people do and it didn’t seem particularly worse than Linux-like environment.Not that I really have anything against MacOS. I think it’s neglected by Apple and not as enjoyable as it used to be. I dislike Apple and the policies it’s pushing for. Nevertheless, it’s ok to use. Everything pretty much is nowadays.replyyndoendo 5 minutes ago

When producing cross-platform software I find creating it on Linux first to be the most cost effective. Porting it to macOS has the least resistance. Windows is where it cost more time and code to release.macOS, Linux, and BSD treat CMD and GUI applications the same while Windows separates applications. Window's two type of application approach brakes the ability to use STDIN and STDOUT for logging and other useful means. Simple debugging of `./app > app.log` does not work on Windows with `app.exe > app.log` with GUI applications. The Windows variant needs a specialized logging system and more boilerplate code.Windows also has one of the worst automation system when it comes to solution deployment. One needs to create custom mouse and keyboard emulation scripts to automate the installation of 3rd party applications when their installer does not support silent mode. AutoIT helps me with this greatly.pjmlp 2 hours ago

Two general-purpose Linux distributions used to pay for Unix certification, although they don't do it anymore since hardly anyone is interested in it these days.https://www.opengroup.org/openbrand/register/brand3617.htmhttps://www.opengroup.org/openbrand/register/brand3622.htmSave these links for the next time someone moans that Linux "is not a real Unix".replymdasen 3 hours ago
| parent | next [–]
It's not just about paying for certification. You also have to replace a lot of things like ed, awk, grep, etc. with versions that are compatible with the UNIX specification. GNU utilities didn't target 100% UNIX compatibility and they have differences that mean that a command that works on UNIX might not work (or might not work the same) on a Linux distro using GNU utilities. glibc has slight differences from the spec too.In order to get a Linux distro certified, you'd have to make changes which would make it less compatible with all the other Linux distros out there.The reason why RedHat doesn't pay for UNIX certification is that their distros wouldn't be compliant. The reason why they don't make their distros compliant is that their customers would vastly prefer that RedHat use "standard Linux" tools than replace them with UNIX-compliant ones. Customers don't want a Linux distro that's subtly different/incompatible compared to what everyone expects in a Linux system. They'd rather it be not-UNIX.Yes, you can modify a Linux distro to be UNIX. However, most Linux systems are not real UNIX - and you wouldn't want it to be real UNIX.replyarccy 2 hours ago

Citation needed.I'm not sure what you mean by "Unix specification". But if you mean the international standard POSIX, yes, people care. Red Hat routinely participates in POSIX spec revision.There are a very few deviations where you have to enable "POSIXLY_CORRECT". If that's what you mean, then you can turn that on. But in every area that matters, Linux distros implement the POSIX spec by default, and you can even turn on the POSIXLY_CORRECT mode to exactly follow it. They extend beyond it, but that is allowed and expected.The people who build the tools in Linux distros care a lot. I know the implementors of dash and GNU make routinely refer to POSIX. The Linux distros don't have to as much with POSIX because that is generally a conpleted work and it's the maintainers of the tools who must address the updates to POSIX.replyjoao 4 hours ago

There was a time when “open standards” were treated as the definition of Unix. At least that's what we aspired to. POSIX, X/Open, and others competed to be the standard that mattered. Formal standards were hoped to be a sounder, fairer basis for compatibility and interoperability than the earlier era of “Unix is whatever this release says it is" for some subset of 7th Edition, System III, System V, BSD, or one's favorite commercial derivative (SunOS/Solaris, HP/UX, AIX, Xenix, UnixWare, ...).That window window of optimism—roughly mid-1980s to mid-1990s—closed fast. Open source projects and _de facto_ standards proved far more powerful in deciding where applications would run, where investments would be made, and which variants survived. Today, the real baseline isn’t POSIX in a binder or some Open Group brand certificate, but Linux + GNU + the APIs everyone codes to. In some ways we've regressed—or more charitably, we shifted back to a more pragmatic form of standardization.replydrob518 1 hour ago

I recently learned that macOS has a (by default) case insensitive filesystem. How does this line up with the certification?replylapsed_lisper 1 hour ago
| parent | next [–]
I don't know about the Unix certification process itself, but the Single Unix Specification explicitly mentions case-insensitivity among non-conforming file system behaviors that are allowed as extensions (in 2.1.1 item 4, third-to-last bullet):https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/So a conforming OS has to make case-sensitive file systems available (which MacOS does: you can create case-sensitive HFS or APFS volumes). But I'm not sure if a conforming OS instance (i.e., running system) has to have any case-sensitive mount points, and either way, AFAIK there's no practical and race-free way for a conforming application to detect whether any particular mount point behaves case-sensitively.So I believe that as far as the standard goes, a conforming application might run on a conformingly-extended OS where no portion of the the file namespace behaves case-sensitively. IOW, a conforming application cannot rely on case-sensitivity for file names.replyp_ing 1 hour ago

I wish jq would be in the posix standard. JSON is EVERYWHERE nowadays. A system that can’t parse it is incomplete. Not having a standard way to write a script that does it and works across *nixes is a mistake.replyPet_Ant 3 hours ago

Yes, there is "UNIX V7" in 2013... which apparently only IBM's AIX supports. This is ironic because the whole idea of UNIX is to create a common platform for interoperability, but only one platform actually supports. I really wonder why Apple just doesn't put a couple of FTEs on it and upgrade to V7. I'm sure it wouldn't take much. But it sort of reminds me of Java and HTML where there were standards to allow for independent implementations, but have collapsed to single implementations.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_UNIX_Specification#Comp...replybadgersnake 2 hours ago

Think of it: it's a Unix system. Literally. A unix system with the usability that your grandma can use. It supports both commercial and open source applications. The year of the linux desktop folks have been trying this for decades.EDIT: already downvoted to negatives. The Linux folks really don't like to be reminded of that.replyyjftsjthsd-h 1 hour ago

> The year of the linux desktop folks have been trying this for decades.Have they? I'm not aware that any of the desktop linux projects particularly care about POSIX or being a certified Unix™.replyp_ing 2 hours ago

Grandma doesn't use certified UNIX. She uses a UNIX-like system. Only the engineers who ran the conformance test use certified UNIX since it required what I would consider heavy modification to the shipped OS configuration.replyKeyframe 2 hours ago
