Cardinals defensive duo Max Melton and LJ Collier have both been ruled out of the rest of this match through injury.Given their 24-point lead at present, they will hope it does not affect them too much.

Jake Elliott is money tonight! He's a great kicker but did have his problems from 50+ last year - those problems seem to have disappeared though as he connects from 51 yards with ease to make it two in this game alone and three for the season already from 50+.

There's a big gamble from Andy Reid early in the third quarter as the Chiefs go for it on fourth down at their own 36. Kareem Hunt gets the ball to try and pound it over from just a yard, but he's stuffed and the Eagles take over on downs in a dangerous position - already within field goal range.

A rapid start to the second half for the Denver Broncos, who have extended their lead to eight points.JK Dobbins with a five-yard run for his second touchdowns in as many games gets his side in a more comfortable position.Given how this one is going, expect the Colts to respond quickly.

James Conner has put a further dent in the Carolina Panthers' miserable Sunday so far.A two yard rush is all it takes to complete the drive of 71 yards and just over five minutes into the second half, the Cardinals have a 24-point lead.Chad Ryland is five from five with his kicks so far.

We are back in action in Arizona, where the Cardinals are currently on the driving.Quarterback Kyler Murray is going well so far with a touchdown pass and north of 150 yards thrown for.Opposing distributor Bryce Young has struggled to find a way through the Cardinals defence.

Image source, Getty ImagesIt's level at half-time in our Super Bowl rematch. Plenty of pretty good defence on show, with just the odd moment of magic from Saquon Barkley and Patrick Mahomes getting the two teams into the end zone.The Chiefs get the ball first to start the second half, but who will have the final say in this one? Gives us a thumbs up for the Eagles and thumbs down for Chiefs.

It's all square at Arrowhead as Jake Elliott holds his nerve to send a 58 yarder sailing between the posts - it was 53 yards before a penalty on the Eagles long snapper.That one would've been good from about 15 yards further out too.

A thrilling first half in Indianapolis has already reached 41 points before the interval.Quarterback Daniel Jones throws for 65 yards and three receptions in as many plays, the latter giving Jonathan Taylor a seven-yard touchdown.Wide receiver Alec Pierce's 44-yard take was the real starring moment in that drive. He was being tackled and was running but still took the catch as he was going to ground.A thrilling first half.

Kyler Murray is throwing dimes out here and Michael Wilson is the grateful recipient.The hosts are cruising in Arizona and Murray picks out Wilson from 11 yards, who takes the catch.The extra-point is converted by Chad Ryland and the Cardinals lead by 17.

AJ Brown, that's a ridiculous catch, falling away with the ball behind him, the throws up one big paw and manages to make it stick - which gives Philly a crucial first down.Under a minute left in the half and the Eagles will look to at least get a field goal to tie this one up.

I think Philadelphia has to get Saquon a little more involved but maybe I'm underestimating just how well the Chiefs are defending him. They're throwing in a lot of misdirection and stopping the Eagles from doing the things they usually like to do.

Image source, Getty ImagesIt's the Patrick Mahomes show! The Chiefs quarterback lowers the shoulder and powers over for a first down, and then takes off again and scampers 13 yards to dive over in at the corner for the touchdown.Usually known for his audacious and unorthodox throws, Mahomes is doing this with his running and toughness - truly leading by example.

Image source, Getty ImagesAdam Trautman had the freedom of the entire end zone to break up a rather tense series of plays between the two sides in Indianapolis.Bo Nix found Trautman, who should have been picked up there, two yards from goal.Will Lutz is good for the extra point and the Broncos lead by eight.

The Arizona Cardinals found themselves at 2nd&30 following a couple of fouls.Back-to-back 10-yard gains get them back up the field before Chad Ryland kicked for three more points.A 47-yarder, of course!

Image source, Getty ImagesKareen Hunt runs for a first down, and getting something going on the ground really is crucial for the Chiefs, they just can't put it all on Patrick Mahomes all the time.Getting at least some joy on the ground will really open things up in the pass game - it'd also slow down this fearsome Eagles pass rush then comes swarming up the middle.

In the space of three plays, Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray has completed two passes worth a combined 50 yards.An 18-yarder James Conner is bettered by a 32-yarder for Tret McBride.Only a few minutes to go until half-time, but the Cardinals are pushing to extend their lead before the break.

Pat Surtain II, the current reigning NFL Defensive Player of the Year, has limped off very gingerly after what looked like a nasty collision.The Broncos are still on top for now, but that's a blow in what has been a tight contest so far.
