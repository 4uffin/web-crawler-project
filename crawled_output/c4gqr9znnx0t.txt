Patrick Mahomes has a wide open receiver down field but he's way off as he tries to heave it down there for him. That's a huge miss as it was a walk-in touchdown if he could just connect, as Philly's defence had totally missed him.

Another tush push and more controversy as the Eagles are ruled short of a first down, and then are given it.In the end they have to punt soon anyway so the Chiefs have another chance to try and get back into the game.

Colts quarterback Daniel Jones is faced with a 3rd&6 on the halfway line, less than two minutes remaining.Jones, as he has done throughout this game, finds the run of Alec Pierce to get to first down and they are really nearing field goal territory.The Colts are trailing, but look favourites to win in the dying embers.

And how costly could that be?From 42 yards, kicker Will Lutz simply cannot get it to go. His first miss of the night.The Colts have regained possession and just need a score in the final two minutes to take the victory.

A quick three and out for the Chiefs is the last thing they needed, but that's what they've got and the Eagles get the ball straight back - and this is right in their wheelhouse now as they'll look to run down the clock and run the ball.

The Carolina Panthers are still going for it here.On fourth and 16, quarterback Bryce Young passes to Brycen Tremaine for 26 yards and a first down.Time is running out, but the Panthers certainly have not given up

So, I'm not a fan of this tush push (especially when the offensive lineman go early...) but what do you think?Are you a fan of the tush push? If so vote thumbs up, if you're not and you want to see it banned go thumbs down....

We're set for a thrilling final six minutes between the Colts and Broncos.The Broncos lead by two and are on the drive, having just crossed into the Colts' half.

They do run it again, and Jalen Hurts this time goes over - or gets pushed over we should say on a play that can only really be stopped if NFL officials decide to ban it.BUt for now the Eagles are masters of it, and it's given them a healthy lead now at Arrowhead with just under eight minutes left to play.

Short yardage at the goal line, you know what that means - it's tush push time but the Chiefs somehow manage to stop Jalen Hurts just short.Nick Sirianni isn't convinced though ans throws the challenge flag believing they got the ball over the line.It's third down so I don't think it matters as they'll run it again and surely punch it in from inches away anyway.

The Indianapolis Colts cannot get those last 12 yards needed and instead, punt.A 28-yard success for Spencer Shrader and this is now a two-point game with under nine minutes to play.

Two plays that again could swing it - firstly AJ Brown tips a pass but two Chiefs defenders just can't snag it.Then Jalen Hurts just lobs up a jump ball under pressure and DeVonta Smith manages to come down with it just a few yards out.
