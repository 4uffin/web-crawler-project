Find it in GameHub under Silksong > hit the three-dot button > PC Game Settings > Steam.To make sure you trigger an upload when you’ve finished, swipe the right edge of the screen left, hit the gear icon and pick Exit. It should say it’s uploading your save to Steam, and it shouldn’t take very long at all before the game exits.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Sean HollisterCloseSean HollisterSenior EditorPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Sean HollisterGamingCloseGamingPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GamingNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsPC GamingClosePC GamingPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All PC GamingMore in this streamSee allProngs rockSean HollisterSep 12Silksong just became the poster child for Windows games on Android.Sean HollisterSep 11You can now play Silksong on flagship Android phones — and pick up where you left off on PCSean HollisterSep 11Most PopularMost PopularThe unbearable sameness of Liquid GlassThe Apple Watch SE 3 is the one to buyiOS 26 with Apple’s Liquid Glass redesign is out nowApple’s new iPhone charger is a (second) of its kindMeta leaks its new smart glasses with a displayThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
