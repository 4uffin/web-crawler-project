Going forward I believe the world is going to think about data centers as a computing unit and we’re going to be thinking about data center-scale computing. No longer just personal computers or servers, but we’re going to be operating on the data center scale.”Since then, the boom in demand for AI chips and servers has driven Nvidia’s value from under $200 billion to over $3 trillion in 2024, surpassing Microsoft, Apple, and Google.According to Bloomberg, Chinese regulators say Nvidia failed to follow agreements to provide new Mellanox product information within 90 days to other chipmaking firms in the country to avoid a monopoly. At the same time, the US Justice Department is also investigating the company for monopolistic behavior.The Biden administration also placed new sanctions on China last week to make it more difficult to produce advanced AI chips there, as it also restricts the capabilities of exports by companies like Nvidia. China retaliated with new limitations on key mineral exports to the US.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Umar ShakirCloseUmar ShakirLast published May 29Posts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Umar ShakirAICloseAIPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All AINewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsNvidiaCloseNvidiaPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NvidiaPolicyClosePolicyPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All PolicyTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMore in this streamSee allNvidia’s AI chips are no longer welcome in ChinaElissa WelleSep 17Nvidia and AMD will cut the US government in on revenue from AI chip sales in China.Richard LawlerAug 11Trump demands CEO of Intel resign over ties to ChinaJess WeatherbedAug 7Most PopularMost PopularApple iPhone Air review: statement pieceVideoHere’s the Jimmy Kimmel clip that got him pulled off the airRepublicans are honoring Charlie Kirk’s memory by declaring war on the First AmendmentI regret to inform you Meta’s new smart glasses are the best I’ve ever triedVideoThe iPhone 17 is the one to get this yearThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
