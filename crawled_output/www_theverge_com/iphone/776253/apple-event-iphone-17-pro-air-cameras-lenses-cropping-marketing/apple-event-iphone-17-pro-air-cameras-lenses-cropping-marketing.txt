He spent over 15 years in the photography industry before joining The Verge as a deals writer in 2021.Apple always makes big claims about the cameras in its new iPhones. But what does it actually mean when Apple says the iPhone 17 Pro’s three rear cameras are equivalent to “eight pro lenses in your pocket” and that the iPhone Air’s one rear camera is equivalent to four lenses?The super-thin iPhone Air only has one camera on its rear: a 48-megapixel sensor with a 26mm-equivalent f/1.6 lens. It’s the same as the main camera of the regular iPhone 17 (which also features a second 0.5x ultrawide camera). The 17 Pro and Pro Max have a similar-but-not-the-same main camera, consisting of a 48MP sensor and 24mm-equivalent f/1.78 lens — and it also has the ultrawide and adds a 4x telephoto lens.RelatedOur first look at the iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro MaxiPhone Air hands-onWhat is a photo?So those are the phones and their cameras, but what about Apple’s complicated lens math?Apple showed a slide of sample images indicating that the iPhone Air’s one rear sensor and lens can be used as 26mm, 28mm, 35mm, and 52mm-equivalent lenses. According to Apple’s technical specifications of the iPhone Air, once you zoom to the 52mm-equivalent focal length (a 2x magnification), you’re down to 12MP of resolution. The 28mm and 35mm “lenses” are likely similar to what we first saw in the iPhone 15 Pro, which works like this:A 28mm image yields a 24MP photo, constructed from a series of 12MP frames and combined with one 48MP frameA 35mm image yields a 24MP photo by using just the center pixels of the 48MP sensorApple’s sample image of the iPhone Air’s four “lenses.” Image: AppleAs for the iPhone 17 Pro, its three actual lenses are billed as equivalent to eight (up from the claimed seven of last year’s 16 Pro model). If its eight “pro lenses” start with the four of its main camera, like the Air’s, then its 48MP ultrawide and telephoto cameras make up the other four. The Verge reached out to Apple for clarification on this and to enumerate all these “pro lenses” in the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone Air, but the company did not respond by the time of publication. So here’s my best estimation of how Apple got eight lenses from three:Like the iPhone Air, the main camera has four selectable equivalent focal lengths: 24mm, 28mm, 35mm, and 52mmThe 48MP, 4x telephoto lens covers an equivalent focal length of 100mm with an aperture of f/2.8A 200mm-equivalent (8x magnification) image yields a 12MP photo from the telephoto lensThe 48MP, 0.5x ultrawide lens covers an equivalent focal length of 13mm with an aperture of f/2.2The same ultrawide lens is also used to take macro close-focusing photos, and Apple’s marketing materials classify this as yet another lens because it’s a very different look (which, okay, fair)Apple’s other sample from its keynote, showing the iPhone 17 Pro’s eight “lenses.” Image: AppleSo that’s how Apple’s lens math works across its cameras. Apple reps called these lenses “optical quality” during the company’s keynote presentation. But are these optical zooms? No, not really. Like most smartphones, they’re a mix of fixed focal length optics and clever computational photography. “Optical quality” is obviously a loose-fitting marketing term. But what’s even more strange and confusing is how Apple’s site lists lenses across its iPhone 17 line as “optical zoom options.”PreviousNext1/2Calling it all “optical zoom options” is S-tier linguistic gymnastics.If you want to get technical, none of these are optical zooms in the traditional sense. An actual optical zoom is a lens that changes focal length optically. Like when you turn a ring on the barrel of a lens or a toggle on a point-and-shoot and the lens physically moves, rendering a different field-of-view on the image plane. I know in the world of smartphones, we use “zoom” a bit loosely to mean any telephoto lens or cropping / digital zoom, but being this fast and loose in your marketing terms feels like it’s getting into misleading territory.What is a lens?Apple is no stranger to being vague in its marketing to make it seem like you’re getting more of something — just try to read some of its charts from past videos and keynotes. But this lens count feels like pseudo-math designed to juice up a feature list and piss off camera nerds at the same time. Using actual optics for more focal lengths will always be better than one optic and some software, as my colleague Allison Johnson showed in her excellent shootout between the Google Pixel 10 Pro and all its AI gimmickry versus a Nikon camera with a bonkers optical zoom. (Yes, the Pixel fared well with correcting heat haze, but so would the Nikon when you bring it into post.)The iPhone Air is not literally four lenses. But is it like having four lenses? Four “pro” lenses? How about four good lenses? We’ll have to find out.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Antonio G. Di BenedettoCloseAntonio G.
