Previously, he was a freelance writer for Popular Mechanics, Men’s Health, and Esquire.At its Connect keynote on Wednesday, Meta officially introduced the $799.99 Meta Ray-Ban Display, also known as Hypernova. The brand’s new, high-end smart glasses feature an in-lens display you can control with wrist-based gestures via the new Meta Neural Band that’s included. The display pairs with your phone and allows you to see everything from text messages and Instagram Reels to maps and more — all without having to pull out your device. They seem like a more fully-realized version of Google Glass, and they’ll be released on September 30th. That’s also when in-store demos will be available at Best Buy, LensCrafters, Sunglass Hut, Ray-Ban stores and Verizon stores (retailer availability depending on your location). You can schedule a demo now.Meta Ray-Ban Display smart glasses$800$800The Ray-Ban Display can’t be bought online, but you can now schedule a demo for when they release on September 30th.Read More$800 at MetaRelatedI sat down with Mark Zuckerberg to try Meta’s impressive new Ray-Ban Display glassesI regret to inform you Meta’s new smart glasses are the best I’ve ever triedThe Meta Ray-Ban Display comes in two sizes (standard and large) and two colors (black or sand) and features transition lenses, which can darken in sunlight and return to clear indoors. The display only shows up in the right lens, and when it’s up, it can show apps in full-color with a 600 by 600 pixel resolution and a 20-degree field of view. The Verge’s Victoria Song briefly went hands-on with the Meta Ray-Ban Display, and she says the monocular design can be a little distracting, though it doesn’t fully obstruct your vision.The Ray-Ban Display frames are thicker than the current Ray-Ban Meta, with edges that are more rounded and an overall shape that’s more square. They also feature overextension hinges on the temple arms, making them a better fit on wide faces. Meta estimates about six hours of battery life with “mixed use,” though we’ll put that claim to the test when we get a unit to review.Photo: Colt Bradley for The VergeMeta also announced the follow-up to the popular Meta Ray-Ban glasses, the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2, which you can order today starting at $379. The company claims that its updated smart glasses will deliver up to eight hours of battery life on a single charge, which is twice the four-hour battery life of the previous generation. The charging case, meanwhile, can recharge the glasses up to 50 percent in 20 minutes, and can provide an additional 48 hours of battery life. The camera can record 3K video at 30fps, 1440p at 30fps, and 1200p at 60fps, all for up to three minutes per recording.Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) smart glasses$379$379$379 at MetaFinally, you can preorder the new Oakley Meta Vanguard at Meta for $499, with a launch to come on October 21st. They feature that quintessential wraparound design that’s made Oakley a household name among sports coaches, hardcore outdoors enthusiasts, and Patagonia-clad dads. The Vanguard features a 12-megapixel, 122-degree camera located in the nose bridge, and an Action Button that acts as a shortcut for the various camera modes. Additionally, they offer up to nine hours of battery life, an IP67 rating, and Garmin integration.Oakley Meta Vanguard$499$499$499 at Meta0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Brandon RussellCloseBrandon RussellCommerce WriterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Brandon RussellARCloseARPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All ARGadgetsCloseGadgetsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GadgetsMetaCloseMetaPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All MetaTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechWearableCloseWearablePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All WearableMost PopularMost PopularApple iPhone Air review: statement pieceVideoHere’s the Jimmy Kimmel clip that got him pulled off the airI regret to inform you Meta’s new smart glasses are the best I’ve ever triedVideoRepublicans are honoring Charlie Kirk’s memory by declaring war on the First AmendmentThe iPhone 17 is the one to get this yearThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
