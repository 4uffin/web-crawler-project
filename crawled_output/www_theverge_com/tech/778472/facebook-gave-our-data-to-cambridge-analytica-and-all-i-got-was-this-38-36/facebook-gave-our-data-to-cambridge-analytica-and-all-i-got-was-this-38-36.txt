Adi has covered video games, biohacking, and more for The Verge since 2011.Remember back in 2023, when we told you how to get your cut of a $725 million class action settlement? A couple of years later, that money is going out.I received an email earlier this week saying my claim had been approved in In re: Facebook, Inc. Consumer Privacy User Profile Litigation, a class action settlement that covered anyone who had a Facebook account between 2007 and 2022. The agreement settled a variety of privacy accusations against Facebook (now Meta), including that it allowed Cambridge Analytica and others to improperly access user data. Earlier today I got the money through PayPal: a total of $38.36. A few other Verge staff and their family members also got payouts, most in the $38 range but including one closer to $5.I’m sure some readers have gotten theirs too, so: what are we buying?0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Adi RobertsonCloseAdi RobertsonSenior ReporterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Adi RobertsonMetaCloseMetaPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All MetaPrivacyClosePrivacyPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All PrivacyTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMost PopularMost PopularApple’s new iPhone charger is a (second) of its kindThe unbearable sameness of Liquid GlassiOS 26 with Apple’s Liquid Glass redesign is out nowMicrosoft is changing how Xbox controllers work on Windows 11Meta leaks its new smart glasses with a displayThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
