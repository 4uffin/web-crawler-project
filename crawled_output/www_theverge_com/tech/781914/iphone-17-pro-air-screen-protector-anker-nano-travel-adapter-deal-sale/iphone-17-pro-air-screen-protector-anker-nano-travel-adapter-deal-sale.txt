If you’re picking up the new iPhone 17 or iPhone Air and want to avoid scratches or cracks on its front glass, we spotted a great deal on a two-pack of amFilm’s OneTouch screen protectors over at Slickdeals. Designed specifically to fit the front of the new 6.3-inch iPhone 17, you can buy a pack on sale starting at a new low price of just $4.49 ($7.50 off) when you apply the promo code EUZWG92J at checkout at Amazon. The promo code also extends to discounts to tempered glass protectors made for other models, including the 6.3-inch iPhone 17 Pro, the 6.5-inch iPhone Air and for the 6.9-inch iPhone 17 Pro Max (this one costs $4.99 with the code).The Verge’s own Cameron Faulkner swears by amFilm, which he uses to cover nearly all his devices. Made from tempered glass, they’ll do a good job of protecting your phone’s screen from accidental drops without interfering with touch sensitivity. Each protector has an anti-fingerprint coating that helps keep your display clear and relatively smudge-free, without compromising your phone’s brightness or clarity.What’s more, they’re also super easy to install. The company includes a guide, alignment tool, dust remover, and bubble remover. In the unlikely event of a botched installation, there’s a second protector included as a backup option. Additionally, each set includes rings to go around the rear lenses to keep them free of scratches.RelatedThe iPhone 17 is the one to get this yearApple iPhone Air review: statement pieceamFilm OneTouch screen protector$4$1267% off$4amFilm’s tempered OneTouch screen protectors will protect your new iPhone 17 or Air from scratches and cracks, and includes a second protector as a backup.

The compact adapter works in over 200 countries and regions, from the UK and most of Europe to Australia, Japan, and more. It also features a single AC outlet, two USB-C ports (one with up to 20W of power), and two USB-A ports, allowing you to charge up to five devices at once.The 43mm OnePlus Watch 3 is on sale for $267.09 ($32 off) at Amazon, which is its best price to date. OnePlus’ latest wearable is the upgraded version of our favorite alternative to Google and Samsung smartwatches. It’s extremely similar to its predecessor, but offers some welcome improvements, including Google Gemini, a rotating crown, and a 60S Health Check-In, which gives you an overview of your heart rate, blood oxygen, mental wellness, wrist temperature, sleep quality, and vascular age. Best Buy is including a $10 e-gift card when you preorder Battlefield 6 starting at $69.99 for PS5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X. The highly-anticipated first-person shooter will hit stores on October 10th, and fans are hoping it will mark a true return to form for the franchise after the release of its disappointing 2021 predecessor, Battlefield 2042.
