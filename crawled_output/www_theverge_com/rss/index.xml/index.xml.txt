Microsoft is adding automatic AI model selection to its Visual Studio Code editor that will automatically pick the best model for "optimal performance." This new auto model feature will select between Claude Sonnet 4, GPT-5, GPT-5 mini and other models for GitHub Copilot free users, but paid users will "primarily rely on Claude Sonnet 4." [&#8230;]

London-based consumer tech startup Nothing has raised $200 million and vowed to usher in a new generation of “AI-native” devices running on operating systems that “are significantly different from the ones today.” In a press release that reads part ode to technology and part manifesto, Nothing founder and CEO Carl Pei said the cash infusion [&#8230;]

<p class="has-text-align-none">London-based consumer tech startup Nothing has raised $200 million and vowed to usher in a new generation of “AI-native” devices running on operating systems that “are significantly different from the ones today.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In a press release that reads part ode to technology and part manifesto, Nothing founder and CEO Carl Pei said the cash infusion — which values Nothing at $1.3 billion — will help the company ramp up distribution and accelerate innovation.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">At the heart of Nothing’s plans is AI. Pei said the company is “building the foundations for the future” on a focused “AI OS” to deliver a “hyper-personalized experience.” However, it’s unclear if Nothing’s operating system ambitions are built on top of Android like Nothing OS. We’ve reached out for clarification.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">This “AI-native platform” will run hardware in widespread use today like smartphones, headphones, and smart watches, Pei said, as well as other devices like smart glasses, electric vehicles, and humanoid robots. He confidently predicts Nothing’s new OS will run “whatever comes next,” too. That said, last October Pei <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/31/carl-pei-says-nothing-could-build-its-own-operating-system/">just as confidently proclaimed</a> that “AI is just a tool” and that the company’s OS should not be described as an AI operating system.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Nothing plans to release its first AI-native devices next year. Its chief challenge will be generating demand in a category that has historically failed to engage the mass market and where success has eluded even the industry’s biggest players like Apple. There’s no shortage of competitors either, including the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/672357/openai-ai-device-sam-altman-jony-ive">mysterious “screen free” device</a> former Apple designer Jony Ive is creating with OpenAI.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Nothing says it’s uniquely positioned to create these future AI devices. “Owning the last-mile distribution point with all its contextual and user knowledge is essential to developing an OS that will help people in their daily lives,” said Pei. “An AI OS that doesn&#8217;t know its user and isn&#8217;t ever-present can&#8217;t deliver a hyper-personalised experience. This is the next chapter for Nothing, integrating an AI experience into our hardware devices to reinvent how technology amplifies us.”</p>

Microsoft is rolling out a new aggregated gaming library inside its Xbox PC app today on Windows.

<p class="has-text-align-none">Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/690967/microsoft-xbox-app-windows-steam-games-aggregated-library-support-beta">has been testing</a> this aggregated library in recent months with Xbox Insiders, but it’s now available to all Xbox PC app users. It’s designed primarily for the new fullscreen Xbox experience that will ship on the Xbox Ally devices, but it’s also part of Microsoft’s efforts to make the Xbox app on Windows <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/11/24318799/microsoft-xbox-app-new-games-homescreen">the home of PC gaming</a>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“When you install a game from a supported PC storefront, it automatically appears in ‘My Library’ within the Xbox PC app, as well as the ‘Most Recent’ list of titles in the sidebar, so you can jump back into your favorite games with just a click,” <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/09/15/access-gaming-library-xbox-on-windows-pc-and-handheld/">explains Jason Beaumont</a>, vice president of experiences at Xbox.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Alongside the library integration, Microsoft is also rolling out a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/763994/microsoft-xbox-app-windows-third-party-stores-apps-utilities">new My Apps section</a> in the Xbox PC app that allows PC gamers to quickly install and launch third-party apps like browsers, gaming utilities, and rival storefronts. This new feature is also designed primarily for handhelds, to help people download and launch games from multiple stores.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Later this month, Microsoft will also add cloud-playable games and game history to the Xbox app that syncs your recent games list on Xbox consoles, PC, or handheld. Microsoft already <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/767697/xbox-cross-device-play-history-cloud-gaming">started rolling this out</a> on Xbox consoles last month. “Once this feature is released, look for the ‘Jump back in’ list on the Home screen of your console, PC, or handheld to find your recent play history and pick up where you left off,” says Beaumont.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Amazon has announced its fall Prime Big Deal Days event. It starts at 12:01AM PT / 3:01AM ET on Tuesday, October 7th, and runs through Wednesday, October 8th. Of course, we’ll bring you all the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals">best deals</a> on <em>Verge</em>-approved gadgets once they become available.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Amazon’s latest Prime Big Deal Days sale is shorter than the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/685299/amazon-prime-day-2025-dates-when">extended four-day Prime Day</a> in July. Even so, that should be plenty of time for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime">Prime members</a> to save ahead of Black Friday and Cyber Monday. The previous Prime Day delivered some of the lowest prices we’ve seen on popular devices like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/ipad/626647/apple-ipad-air-review-2025">iPad Air</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24245570/apple-airpods-4-review">AirPods 4</a>, and we’re hoping for a similar caliber of deals this time around. In years past, we’ve seen deep discounts on big-name brands like Samsung, Apple, and Beats, plus all-time low prices on Amazon devices.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Although the next Prime Deal Days doesn’t start for another few weeks, Amazon is offering early deals starting today. You can save up to 50 percent off select Amazon devices, including the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-ad-free-content-parental-controls/dp/B0CVDV2WS9/">Fire HD 8 Kids Pro Tablet</a>, <a href="http://amazon.com/New-Amazon-Kindle-Kids-glare-free/dp/B0CNVBS5JN/">Kindle Kids</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-New-release-Designed-parental-controls/dp/B09B96PMLY/">Echo Dot Kids bundle</a>. Other deals include a discount on the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-Essentials-including-All-new/dp/B0DB6BCWGV/">Kindle Paperwhite Essentials bundle</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Luna-Controller/dp/B07P989QTJ/">Luna Wireless Controller</a>, and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Battery-Doorbell-Pan-Tilt-Indoor/dp/B0D934L4TW/">Ring Battery Doorbell with Ring Pan-Tilt Indoor Camera bundle</a>. Meanwhile, eligible Prime members can get three months of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/hz/subscribe/ku">Kindle Unlimited</a> for free.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">While Prime Day deals are exclusive to subscribers, Best Buy, Walmart, and other retailers often offer similar discounts, so you’ll have plenty of ways to shop. If you want to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime">sign up for Prime</a>, a subscription runs $14.99 per month or $139 per year. If you’re between the ages of 18 and 24, you can get a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime?primeCampaignId=studentWlpPrimeRedir&amp;ref=std_prime_desktop&amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;ascsubtag=__vg0915awD__685299__________________" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">six-month subscription for free</a>, with it renewing after that period for $7.49 per month (half the normal cost of Prime). Prime Big Deal Days will take place in the US, the UK, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Poland, Singapore, Spain, and Sweden, and for the first time, Colombia, Ireland, and Mexico.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Before Prime Big Deal Days gets underway, Amazon is holding a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/778008/amazon-fall-hardware-event-announced-kindles-echo-alexa">fall hardware event</a> on September 30th. Amazon traditionally uses the annual event to reveal a slew of new products, including Echo smart speakers, Fire TV devices, Kindles, and more. Hopefully, we’ll see at least some of the new tech discounted during Amazon’s annual pre-Black Friday sale.</p>

<p>We live in a golden age of controllers. The gamepads on the market now are of higher quality, more versatile, and more customizable than anything from even one console generation ago. If you play games on an Xbox Series X or Series S (or a Windows PC), you have the unenviable task of choosing between several high-quality controllers from Microsoft as well as a plethora of great options from the likes of 8BitDo, PowerA, Razer, Scuf, GameSir, Nacon, and Turtle Beach. Some of them have drift-resistant <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/31/23571821/nintendo-switch-joy-con-joystick-drift-button">Hall effect</a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/643886/joystick-drift-tunneling-magnetoresistance-tmr-hall-effect-gaming-solution">TMR-based joysticks</a> for improved longevity, yet all of them are good for one reason or another. The days of the cheap “little sibling” controller that looked cool, but barely worked, are over.</p>
<p>We’ve spent a ton of time playing all kinds of games (first-person shooters, fighters, third-person action-adventure, racing, indie roguelikes, etc.) to test a wide swath of Xbox controllers, and it may not be a surprise that the standard, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Wireless-Controller-Pulse-Red-Windows-Devices/dp/B08K4HLCPR">Xbox Wireless Controller</a> is the best option for most folks. It makes for a great PC and Steam Deck controller, too. The default Xbox gamepad strikes the right balance of quality, comfort, versatility, and price, but there are several alternatives worth considering.</p>

<p>Okay, I already know what you’re thinking. “The best controller for Xbox is the one that comes with the Xbox?” That may seem like a no-brainer, but this standard controller truly does earn this title as the best. It lacks some extras found on pricier options, but this controller is the distillation of all that has made the last 20 years of Xbox gamepads great, and it shows.</p>
<p>Thanks to Microsoft’s proprietary wireless protocol, this is the only affordable wireless Xbox controller out there. (Third-party wireless options have been trickling out in recent years, but they’re mostly at the high end.) While some hate the standard Xbox wireless controller for its use of AA batteries instead of a built-in rechargeable cell, that also means it’s flexible, allowing for rechargeable AAs or a battery pack. And user-replaceable batteries mean you’re not stuck with a controller that doesn’t hold its charge after years of use. It also works over a USB-C wired connection.</p>
<img src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23516624/adbenedetto_220508_5192_0036.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="&lt;em&gt;You won’t find a better wireless controller at this price.&lt;/em&gt;" data-portal-copyright="" />
<p>But the standard-issue Xbox pad isn’t just great because of its varied connectivity. The hardware itself is excellent for the controller’s $65 (and often less) asking price. The sticks, buttons, triggers, and the sunken dish-shaped D-pad all feel impeccably tight, with the latter having a satisfying clickiness to it. If you’re a hardcore fighting game fan, you’ll probably be best served by a dedicated fight stick or a controller geared toward that genre — one with a superb D-pad like <a href="https://www.target.com/p/hori-pad-pro-wired-controller-for-xbox-series-x-xbox-one/-/A-86501139">Hori’s Horipad Pro</a> — but the Xbox Wireless Controller is otherwise an extraordinary jack-of-all-trades.</p>
<p>The only things it really lacks compared to pricier options are extra, customizable buttons and software tuning for things like stick sensitivity (button remapping is available), though Microsoft does offer cosmetic customization through its <a href="https://xboxdesignlab.xbox.com/en-us/configure/xbox-wireless-controller">Xbox Design Lab</a>, which bumps the price from $79.99 to <strong>$124.93</strong> depending on the configuration. There’s a lot to love about these controllers, whether you make your own or pick one from the many colors that Microsoft offers.</p>

<p>The 8BitDo Ultimate Wired Controller for Xbox is a fantastic budget model that typically retails for $44.99 but can often be found for as little as $29.99.&nbsp;The shape is reminiscent of Nintendo’s Switch Pro Controller, only a bit smaller, with hints of Xbox influence and a curvaceous design that feels great to hold.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">On the hardware front, the Ultimate Wired Controller features Hall effect sticks with satisfying tension. It also uses Hall effect triggers with dedicated vibration motors, though it lacks trigger stops, unlike our previous budget pick, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PowerA-Advantage-Wired-Controller-Xbox-Console/dp/B0CT5HHY77">PowerA Advantage Wired</a>. Its D-pad, face buttons, and bumpers are nice and clicky, too, despite being smaller than we&#8217;d typically like. It has two rear paddles, remappable buttons, and the ability to save up to three profiles, which you can switch between on the fly using a dedicated button. There’s even a built-in mute switch for audio, which isn’t common on cheaper controllers. You can download the <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9pmc9mn3zz85?hl=en-US&amp;gl=US">8BitDo Ultimate Software X app</a> on PC or Xbox to fully customize this controller.</p>

<p>The 8BitDo Ultimate Wired works as a wired controller with your PC, but if you prefer wireless connectivity, the company also makes a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D1VHT3S6">three-mode wireless version</a> for $69.99 with support for both Bluetooth and 2.4GHz wireless (via a dongle). The wireless version is a bit more expensive, however, and it’s still limited to wired connectivity on Xbox consoles. </p>

<p><em><em><strong>Connectivity:</strong> Xbox wireless, Bluetooth, wired / <strong>Connector type:</strong> USB-C / <strong>Mappable rear buttons: </strong>Up to four / <strong>Software customization:</strong> Yes / <strong>Power:</strong> Built-in rechargeable</em></em></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/31/20926499/microsoft-xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2-review-price-specs-features">Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2</a> is Microsoft’s fanciest controller, and it’s got a lot of nice extras, like better build quality, extra buttons, user-swappable sticks and D-pad, a built-in rechargeable battery, and loads of software customization. Where the standard Xbox controller is constructed entirely of unassuming plastic, the Elite mixes higher quality soft-touch plastic, rubberized grips, and metallic touches for a superior fit and finish. This makes it heftier than the stock controller, and as a result, it just <em>feels </em>nicer in your hands. It also comes with a charging dock and zip-up case with passthrough charging, completing a really nice package for $199.99 (or sometimes less, if it’s on sale). </p>
<p>There’s also the stripped-down <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/7/23340603/microsoft-xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2-core-white-controller-release-date-price">Elite Series 2 “Core” version</a> with an MSRP of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elite-2-Controller-Black-Xbox-One/dp/B0B789CGGQ/">$149.99</a>, which ditches the add-ons but is equally customizable. You can buy them separately in <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/microsoft-xbox-elite-series-2-complete-component-pack-black/6514399.p">a $59.99 accessories pack</a>, but you’ll end up paying more that way, barring sales or discounts.</p>
<p>A pricey controller like an Xbox Elite is a bit of a splurge purchase. Most of us are not competing at e-sports levels that require its high-end features. Nevertheless, it’s fun to use something that feels nicer, offers ways to custom-tailor it to your liking, and maybe gives you a slight competitive edge thanks to features like hair triggers and removable rear paddles. In theory, you may be able to get shots off faster in an online shooter with the hair triggers, and you can map the paddles to functions like jump, crouch, reload, etc., while keeping your thumb on the right stick. You could teach yourself claw grip to accomplish the latter with even a cheap wired controller, sure, but it just won’t feel as cool or easy as when using an Elite.</p>
<p>While the Elite is still a great controller in 2025, you should keep in mind that it’s been around since 2019 and a Series 3 revision is feeling long overdue. The Series 2 also has a bit of a reputation for lackluster quality control — with horror stories from users about going through multiple replacements under warranty. Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/15/21517317/microsoft-xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2-hardware-issues-warranty">extended the controller’s warranty</a> from 90 days to a year in late 2020 to help address concerns, but buying an Elite Series 2 may still feel like a slightly risky proposition. It also predates the current-gen implementation of a dedicated Share button, and its potentiometer-based sticks run the risk of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21504741/nintendo-switch-joy-con-drift-problem-explained">stick drift</a> after long-term use (something third parties are addressing with controllers that use drift-free Hall effect sticks, unlike all three big console manufacturers).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even so, the Elite 2 remains by far the most well-rounded option for a step-up Xbox controller — thanks in large part to its impressive build and expansive software experience. If all these caveats give you pause, though, there is another promising option.</p>

<p><em><em><strong>Connectivity:</strong> Wireless USB dongle (Xbox / PC), wired / <strong>Connector type: </strong>USB-C / <strong>Mappable rear buttons:</strong> Four / <strong>Software customization:</strong> Yes / <strong>Power:</strong> Built-in rechargeable</em></em></p>
<p>At $199.99, <a href="https://www.razer.com/console-controllers/razer-wolverine-v3-pro/RZ06-05200100-R3U1">Razer’s Wolverine V3 Pro</a> controller is as expensive (or more, depending on available deals) than the Elite Series 2, but it’s worth the cost if you want a high-end controller with drift-free sticks. Not only is the V3 Pro Razer’s first foray into using Hall effect sticks, it’s the company’s first fully wireless Xbox gamepad. It also sports some of the best hair-trigger lockouts around, yielding a mouse-like click usually found on even pricier Scuf controllers (a previous high-ranking pick of ours). </p>
<p>Other than that, the V3 Pro is similar to the previous V2 Pro, with six remappable buttons — four rear paddles in new, angled orientations and two extra shoulder buttons — and some RGB lighting. The buttons and D-pad still have that satisfying micro-switch tactility and audible clickiness like the previous-gen V2 Pro, but the RGB lighting is more subtle this time around.</p>
<img src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25799876/247446_Razer_Wolverine_V3_Pro_ADiBenedetto_0004.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="&lt;em&gt;It’s not every day you see six buttons on top of a controller.&lt;/em&gt;" data-portal-copyright="" />
<p>The Wolverine V3 Pro’s biggest shortcomings compared to Microsoft’s Elite Series 2 are its&nbsp;more basic software customization, its lack of Bluetooth, and the fact that it needs a USB dongle to work wirelessly. The V3 Pro is otherwise the better pick if you can justify its high price, which, unlike the Series 2, is rarely subjected to discounts. Luckily, if you can’t, there’s also the $99.99 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Wolverine-Tournament-Gaming-Controller-Desktop/dp/B0DS6P7P7V">Wolverine V3 Pro Tournament Edition</a> that has a nearly identical set of features in a wired configuration.</p>

<div class="product-block"><h3>GameSir G7 Pro</h3>
<div class="product-description">GameSir’s G7 Pro is a wired Xbox controller with remapable rear buttons, adjustable triggers, and TMR joysticks. It can also be connected wirelessly to a PC (via a 2.4Ghz dongle) or Android (via Bluetooth).</div>
<figure class="product-image"><img loading="lazy" width="300" height="200" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/GameSir-G7-Pro.jpg?w=300" class="attachment-medium size-medium" alt="GameSir&#039;s G7 Pro controller on a brown background." /></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em><em><strong>Connectivity:</strong> <em><em>Wired (Xbox)</em></em></em></em>, <em><em>wireless USB dongle (PC), Bluetooth (Android)
/ <strong>Connector type: </strong>USB-C / <strong>Mappable rear buttons:</strong> Two / <strong>Software customization:</strong> Yes / <strong>Power:</strong> Built-in rechargeable</em></em></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">If you don’t mind using a wired controller, GameSir’s G7 Pro offers some features of the splurge-worthy Xbox Elite Controller 2 for under $100. It has remappable buttons, smooth-feeling drift-resistant TMR control sticks, a satisfying weight, and textured grips that made it feel comfortable to hold even with sweaty palms.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The G7 Pro is actually a battery-powered wireless controller, but its cable free connectivity is limited to PC (via an included 2.4Ghz dongle) and Android (via Bluetooth). You’ll need to plug the controller into the Xbox with a cable, and GameSir provides a lengthy USB-C to USB-A cord. The cable was long enough that I could play games from my couch (roughly six feet away) without feeling tethered.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">I was impressed with the G7 Pro’s overall build quality, especially the triggers, which could be locked by flipping switches on its back. GameSir includes three swappable direction pads with the G7 Pro, which can be swapped by lifting the front of the controller’s shell and popping them in and out. However, its face buttons felt noticeably cheaper than the ones on the Elite 2, which makes sense given their price difference.
Button feel aside, the controller never dropped an input, even when I mashed buttons to string together elaborate combos in <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater</em>, or continuously cast spells, dodged, and healed in <em>Diablo IV.</em> If an action was mistimed, it was on me.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">What the controller lacks in face button quality is more than made up for in customizability. GameSir Nexus, a free app on the Xbox Store, allowed me to remap any button (including the L4 and R4 buttons on its backside), adjust the vibration intensity of both triggers, enable two flavors of hair trigger mode, and set the deadzone for each control stick. You can save up to four profiles with different settings, and quickly switch between them by pressing the controller’s M button along with one of the face buttons. You never need to touch these options, or even download the GameSir Nexus app for the G7 Pro to work, but doing so will unlock its full potential.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The GameSir G7 Pro is an excellent Xbox controller, especially in its price range. I’d have liked the option to use it wirelessly, but that wasn’t a dealbreaker for me. That said, it’s something to consider depending on how far away you are from your Xbox when playing. If you’re a multi-platform gamer and want a controller to use with both an Xbox and PC (or Android device), it’s an even better choice.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="8bTkJx">Other Xbox controllers we tested</h2>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/VALOR-Wired-Performance-Controller-Gaming-Console/dp/B0DTB178JG/">Scuf Valor Pro</a> is the company’s first Xbox controller with Hall effect sticks, as well as its cheapest <a href="https://www.amazon.com/VALOR-Wired-Performance-Controller-Gaming-Console/dp/B0DTB3QCS5">at $109.99</a>. Scuf emulates Microsoft’s winning ergonomics while implementing redesigned remappable rear buttons (two are removable) and shoulder bumpers that are more comfortable to reach. It also has trigger stops that produce a satisfying click with next to no travel when pressed. The D-pad produces a similarly satisfying click, one we prefer over the softer tactile feel of the Instinct. The Valor Pro is not the most exciting controller on paper, but it’s a solid option for Scuf faithful or anyone who wants more durable analog sticks. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/hands-on/616019/scuf-valor-pro-hands-on-impressions-wired-xbox-controller">Read our hands-on impressions</a>.</li>
<li>We tested PowerA’s latest pro-style Xbox controllers, including the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PowerA-FUSION-Controller-gamepad-Windows-Console/dp/B0D8T82K5C">Fusion Pro 4 Wired</a> ($74.99) and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Controller-Lumectra-Officially-Licensed-Console/dp/B0D8TB3W72">PowerA Fusion Pro Wireless</a> ($159.99). They’re standard fare for pro-style controllers these days, with height-adjustable Hall effect sticks, four remappable rear buttons, three-way trigger locks, and onboard volume controls. They’re similar, but the Pro Wireless has four trippy Lumectra lighting zones that respond to your button presses. Both controllers are satisfying to use and a clear step up from PowerA’s older products in terms of overall quality, but they ultimately don’t stand out much at these price points.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Nacon-Revolution-X-Officially-Licensed-Xbox-Controller-Xbox-Series-X-S-Xbox-One-Windows-10-11-PCs-Hardware-Software-Customization-Dolby-Atmos-3D-Audi/478152446">Nacon’s Revolution X</a> ($25.90) remains one of the most customizable wired controllers you can get (it even has removable weights in its handles), and its software is nearly as expansive as Microsoft’s first-party app.</li>
<li>If you’re the nostalgic type, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hyperkin-Wired-Controller-Windows-Anniversary-Limited/dp/B09FYFT4NN">Hyperkin Duke</a> ($89.99), <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D9638Z3J">DuchesS</a> ($49.99), and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C5DXD7R3">Xenon</a> ($49.99) are faithful wired recreations of Xbox gamepads from Microsoft’s first two console generations. They’re kind of dumb but endearing (especially the chunky Duke), but they’re unique collector pieces you can also use on modern games.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none" id="what-s-coming-next">What’s coming next?</h2>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Hyperkin’s Competitor controller, which it announced in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24335156/hyperkins-new-xbox-controller-looks-like-a-ps5-dualsense">January at CES</a>, will be released <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/761638/hyperkin-competitor-xbox-wired-controller-sony-ps5-dualsense">in October</a> for $49.99. The wired gamepad looks almost identical to the PlayStation 5’s DualSense controller, with a pair of analog sticks next to one another at the bottom of the controller, glassy buttons, and a non-contiguous D-pad. Hyperkin is offering the Competitor in five colors, but only the black and white controllers will be available in the US at launch.

<p>Below, we’ve rounded up the best deals currently available on each model, including both iterations of the AirPods 4, the latest AirPods Pro, and the AirPods Max. </p>

<p>At its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24239739/apple-iphone-16-event-announcements-watch-series-10-airpods">September 2024 event</a>, Apple introduced the AirPods 4, a pair of wireless earbuds available in two variations: a $129 standard model and a $179 noise-canceling model. Both versions represent significant upgrades over the third-gen AirPods, with a more comfortable design and improved audio performance. They’re also better for taking calls thanks to Apple’s Voice Isolation feature, which focuses the mics on your voice so you can be heard more clearly in noisy environments.</p>
<p>The $179 AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation offer a surprisingly effective noise-canceling mode, a helpful transparency mode, and several other Pro-level features. The latest AirPods Pro do a better job of tuning out noise, but the AirPods 4 with ANC still do a good job of reducing sound. They also feature other perks formerly reserved for Apple’s top-of-the-line earbuds, including wireless charging and a case with a built-in speaker that allows you to easily track it down via Apple’s Find My app.</p>
<p>Given they’ve been out for nearly a year, we consistently see discounts on both versions of the AirPods 4. Right now, for instance, the standard AirPods 4 are on sale at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGHMNQ5Z">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-AirPods-4/11381374703/">Walmart</a> for $116 ($13 off), which is $27 shy of their all-time low. The AirPods 4 with ANC, meanwhile, are available at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Headphones-Cancellation-Transparency-Personalized/dp/B0DGJ7HYG1/?th=1">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/AirPods-4-with-Active-Noise-Cancellation/11384707978/">Walmart</a> for their typical sale price of $168.99 (also $10 off), which is a far cry from their Prime Day low of $119.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At its recent “Awe Dropping” event, Apple introduced the new AirPods Pro 3. In addition to improved noise cancellation and sound, the earbuds now include a built-in heart rate sensor that syncs with the iPhone Fitness app to track your pulse and calories burned across more than 50 workout types — essentially doubling as a fitness tracker. They’re also more comfortable and secure than their predecessor, thanks to a redesigned, more angled fit and five ear tip sizes, including a new XXS option. On top of that, they carry a more robust
IP57 rating for dust, water, and sweat resistance and debut a live translation feature that generally conveys the gist well, though with enough errors that it can’t beat a human interpreter.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Because the AirPods Pro 3 are brand new and won’t hit shelves until September 19th, there aren’t any deals available yet. For now, you can only pick them up at their full $249 price from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FQFB8FMG/">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/apple-airpods-pro-3-white/JJGCQLYK5F">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/AirPods-nbsp-Pro-nbsp-3/17835006350">Walmart</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However, if you’re looking to save, the second-gen AirPods Pro with USB-C remain a solid option and are still widely available despite no longer being part of Apple’s official lineup. They’re currently available at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Cancellation-Transparency-Personalized-High-Fidelity/dp/B0D1XD1ZV3/">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/AirPods-Pro-2nd-generation-with-MagSafe-Case-USB-C/5689919121">Walmart</a> for $199 ($50 off), which is their typical sale price and a relatively minor discount compared to previous sales. While they lack the AirPods Pro 3’s heart rate sensor, live translation feature, and new XXS ear tips, the second-gen AirPods Pro still deliver excellent noise cancellation that outperforms the first-gen model. They also add swipe-based controls and an extra-small fourth ear tip. Apple additionally updated them in 2023 with a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23878402/apple-airpods-pro-usb-c-adaptive-audio-conversation-awareness-test-review">USB-C charging case</a> and an upgraded IP54 rating for water and dust resistance, while the latest version also supports lossless audio when used with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24054862/apple-vision-pro-review-vr-ar-headset-features-price">Apple’s Vision Pro headset</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/12/24242929/apple-airpods-pro-hearing-aids-fda-authorization">doubles as a pair of FDA-approved heari</a><strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/12/24242929/apple-airpods-pro-hearing-aids-fda-authorization">ng aids</a>.</strong></p>

<p>The AirPods Max aren’t the iconic in-ears that have become synonymous with the AirPods name. They’re large and luxurious, comprised of aluminum, steel, and mesh fabric that remains comfortable during extended listening sessions. They also sport excellent noise cancellation, Apple’s spatial audio feature, and expansive, balanced sound, even if they lag behind some of their peers when it comes to bass response and features. They’re not the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones">best noise-canceling headphones</a> for most people —&nbsp;blame the sticker price — but it’s hard to find a better pair of Bluetooth headphones if you’re an iPhone user.</p>
<p>Toward the end of last year, Apple replaced the first-gen Max with&nbsp;a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/17/24242378/airpods-max-usb-c-unchanged-missing-features">new model</a> that features support for USB-C charging and a few new color options.

The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals is done with its role in the Epic Google case, and Google won’t be happy with the result. On Friday, the court completely denied its petition to have its Epic v.

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals is done with its role in the Epic Google case, and Google won’t be happy with the result. On Friday, the court completely denied its petition to have its <em>Epic v. Google</em> case re-heard — and pressed play <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/717440/google-epic-open-play-store-emergency-stay">on a permanent injunction</a> that will force Google to begin cracking open its Android app store.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Unless or until the US Supreme Court decides to hear the case, Google will be forced to let developers bypass its Google Play Billing app store payment system, and let them link to outside app store downloads, within 30 days. And that’s just the start. Google will also be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/716856/epic-v-google-win-in-appeals-court">forced to carry rival app stores inside the Google Play Store and share its full catalog of apps</a> with those stores by summer 2026 unless the Supreme Court grants a stay.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Epic already won its case at the Ninth Circuit <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/716856/epic-v-google-win-in-appeals-court">on July 31st,</a> when a three-judge panel decided not to overturn <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23994174/epic-google-trial-jury-verdict-monopoly-google-play">the unanimous jury verdict from 2023</a> that Google’s app store and payment systems had become illegal monopolies. But Google argued that the Supreme Court might see things differently, and asked for what’s called an “en banc” review where the whole Ninth Circuit weighs in. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But not a single additional Ninth Circuit judge wanted to re-hear the case, the court wrote on Friday, denying Google’s petition. And with that, the Ninth Circuit also restarted the clock on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/717440/google-epic-open-play-store-emergency-stay">forcefully cracking open Android</a>, giving the company a new deadline of just 30 days to begin complying, and 10 months until Google must open up its app store to rivals. That’s up from 14 days and 8 months previously.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">So, what must Google do by October? Here’s the TL;DR:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Stop Google from forcing app developers to use Google Play Billing</li>
<li>Let Android developers tell users about other ways to pay from within the Play Store</li>
<li>Let Android developers link to ways to download their apps outside of the Play Store</li>
<li>Let developers set their own prices</li>
<li>Stop sharing money or perks with phonemakers, carriers, and app developers in exchange for Google Play exclusivity or preinstallation</li>
<li>Work with Epic to resolve any disputes as Google builds a system to let rival app stores in</li>
</ul>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Don’t take my word for it; here’s the full text directly out of Judge Donato’s original permanent injunction for the parts that now have a 30-day deadline:</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none">4. For a period of three years ending on November 1, 2027, Google may not share revenue generated by the Google Play Store with any person or entity that distributes Android apps, or has stated that it will launch or is considering launching an Android app distribution platform or store.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">5. For a period of three years ending on November 1, 2027, Google may not condition a payment, revenue share, or access to any Google product or service, on an agreement by an app developer to launch an app first or exclusively in the Google Play Store.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">6. For a period of three years ending on November 1, 2027, Google may not condition a payment, revenue share, or access to any Google product or service, on an agreement by an app developer not to launch on a third-party Android app distribution platform or store a version of an app that includes features not available in, or is otherwise different from, the version of the app offered on the Google Play Store.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">7. For a period of three years ending on November 1, 2027, Google may not condition a payment, revenue share, or access to any Google product or service, on an agreement with an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) or carrier to preinstall the Google Play Store on any specific location on an Android device.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">9. For a period of three years ending on November 1, 2027, Google may not require the use of Google Play Billing in apps distributed on the Google Play Store, or prohibit the use of in-app payment methods other than Google Play Billing. Google may not prohibit a developer from communicating with users about the availability of a payment method other than Google Play Billing. Google may not require a developer to set a price based on whether Google Play Billing is used.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">10. For a period of three years ending on November 1, 2027, Google may not prohibit a developer from communicating with users about the availability or pricing of an app outside the Google Play Store, and may not prohibit a developer from providing a link to download the app outside the Google Play Store.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">13. Within thirty days of the date of this order, the parties will recommend to the Court a three-person Technical Committee. Epic and Google will each select one member of the Technical Committee, and those two members will select the third member. After appointment by the Court, the Technical Committee will review disputes or issues relating to the technology and processes required by the preceding provisions. If the Technical Committee cannot resolve a dispute or issue, a party may ask the Court for a resolution. The Technical Committee may not extend any deadline set in this order, but may recommend that the Court accept or deny a request to extend. Each party will bear the cost of compensating their respective party-designated committee member for their work on the committee. The third member’s fees will be paid by the parties in equal share.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Google declined to answer whether it will comply with the court’s order by removing the requirement for Google Play Billing, allowing other payment methods, and letting developers link outside the Play Store by October, and working on the joint Technical Committee. Google spokesperson Dan Jackson only had this statement to offer:</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>We are disappointed with the Ninth Circuit’s decision – the injunction will undermine the security and privacy of users, and we are reviewing our appeal options. Protecting users and the Android ecosystem remains our top priority.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="has-text-align-none">I also asked Epic about the committee, but haven’t heard back yet. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">So far, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1966592849668915632">has tweeted:</a> “Now Google Play has 30 days to free ALL DEVELOPERS to offer competing payments in the USA — as Apple is required to do — free of scare screens, junk fees, and restrictions!” and “With super strong precedent in Epic v Apple, there&#8217;s no room for malicious compliance this time.” He <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1967058096507039886">also suggested </a>that Epic doesn’t oppose <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/765881/google-android-apps-side-loading-developer-verification">Google’s new Android developer verification requirements</a> in principle, but “we do oppose any use of such verification processes to block, stifle, or tax competing stores.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Google has not yet said whether it will appeal to the Supreme Court, and we’ve asked about that as well. According to the Ninth Circuit, Google said that if it did appeal, it would do so within 45 days. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Here’s the Ninth Circuit’s latest decision: </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">An unlisted and now-removed video from Meta showed off a new pair of Ray-Ban branded smart glasses with a display and a wristband to help control them, <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-design-hud-wristband-clips-leak/">as reported by <em>UploadVR</em></a>. The video also features a new pair of wraparound “Sphaera” Oakley smart glasses with a camera on the nose, meaning that Meta itself may have inadvertently leaked two of its biggest announcements from its Connect event this week.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">For the glasses with a display, the video includes branding that says “Meta | Ray-Ban” and “Display,” so perhaps Meta will call them the Meta Ray-Ban Display. Based on a brief clip included in <em>UploadVR’s</em> article, the actual display is in the right lens of the glasses, and the clip shows how the glasses will let you do things like ask Meta AI a question, look at a map on the glasses to help you navigate, translate a sign, or use your hand with the wristband to “write” a reply to a chat.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Earlier this year, CNBC <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/22/meta-hypernova-ar-glasses-wristband.html">reported that</a> the wristband for Meta’s codenamed “Hypernova” glasses with a display would use surface electromyography (sEMG) technology to interpret signals from hand movements to help you control the device, so the clip is presumably showing that tech in action.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">President Donald Trump is trying to smooth things over with South Korea after his administration arrested hundreds of workers at a Hyundai plant in Georgia earlier this month. Just hours after <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz9j585g23go">reports indicated</a> that South Korea would open a human rights investigation into the detention of Korean employees, <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115204049358078594">Trump said</a> he doesn’t “want to frighten off” foreign investment into the US — something he has made a priority during his second administration.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">On September 4th, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents descended on the electric vehicle battery plant operated by Hyundai and LG Energy Solutions, detaining nearly 500 workers, including around 300 workers from South Korea. ICE officials claimed the workers overstayed their visas or weren’t permitted to work in the US, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/world/asia/south-korea-human-rights-abuses-hyundai-raid-trump-foreign-workers-rcna231289">according to NBC News</a>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Workers interviewed <a href="https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/foreignaffairs/20250914/shackled-and-chained-mass-detention-of-koreans-fuels-criticism-of-us">by <em>The Korea Times</em></a> say they were “shackled and handcuffed” and then brought to the ICE detention center in Folkston, Georgia, while their belongings and phones were confiscated. It’s not clear whether the workers were even eligible for deportation, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/12/business/economy/hyundai-raid-worker-visas.html">as <em>The New York Times</em></a> reported on Friday that “in at least one instance, officials admitted a worker was employed legally and forced him to leave the country anyway.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">As noted by the <em>Times</em>, many of the workers entered the US on a B1 visa for business travel, allowing them to stay in the US for less than six months, or on a visa waiver program, permitting them to stay for up to 90 days. Some companies use short-term visas instead of H-1B visas, which allow foreign workers to stay in the US for up to six years, because they’re cheaper, faster to obtain, and less restrictive. “Previous US administrations had largely turned a blind eye to the practice,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/sep/12/south-korean-outrage-at-us-detention-ordeal-as-300-workers-return-home">according to <em>The Guardian</em></a>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump has called on foreign companies to invest more money into the US to avoid paying costly tariffs. <a href="https://www.hyundainews.com/en-us/releases/4404">Hyundai responded with the announcement</a> in March that it would spend $21 billion in the US from 2025 to 2028, with plans to expand car production in the US to 1.2 million vehicles each year and improve its facilities. The removal of hundreds of workers could delay these plans, as Hyundai has already <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/11/business/hyundai-raid-plant-delay-ceo">pushed back the opening</a> of its Georgia factory.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The raid sparked outrage from South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, who <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly0e4k750go">called the move</a> “extremely bewildering” and said companies in the country will be “very hesitant” about pouring more money into the US. South Korea’s security advisor Wi Sung-Lac added that <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/society-equity/south-korea-says-provide-clear-visa-guidelines-its-companies-operating-us-2025-09-12/">the government would work</a> with the US to carve out clearer guidelines for visa requirements, as well as potentially develop a new category for Korean workers, according to <em>Reuters</em>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The incident puts the Trump administration on shaky ground with South Korea, which has long remained an ally of the US. In <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115204049358078594">a post on Truth Social</a>, President Trump wrote that he would like to bring foreign workers to the US to “teach and train” employees based in the US. “We welcome them, we welcome their employees, and we are willing to proudly say we will learn from them, and do even better than them at their own ‘game,’ sometime into the not too distant future!”</p>
