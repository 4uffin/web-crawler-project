In addition to the long-awaited reveal of Meta’s updated Ray-Ban smart glasses, the company had some other exciting surprises to share, too.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Here’s a roundup of all the new tech and software updates announced by Meta.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/779566/meta-ray-ban-display-hands-on-smart-glasses-price-battery-specs">Meta’s display-equipped smart specs make their debut</a></h2>
<img src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Meta-AI-1.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="Image: Meta" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Rumors have swirled <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641153/meta-hypernova-ray-ban-smart-glasses-price">for months</a> about Meta launching a pair of smart glasses with a display, and now they’re finally here. The glasses, dubbed the Meta Ray-Ban Display, feature a full-color, high-res screen in the right lens that you can use to view messages, take video calls, read live captions, see walking directions, and preview the pictures you’re about to take with the built-in 12-megapixel camera.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">You control the display with a wristband, allowing you to scroll, click, and, eventually, write out messages, using different gestures. The glasses offer up to six hours of “mixed-use” battery life, or up to 30 hours with the collapsible charging case.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses start at $799, with both the wristband and glasses coming in black or brown. The glasses will be available in the US starting September 30th at Best Buy, LensCrafters, and Ray-Ban stores.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/780012/meta-ray-ban-gen-2-smart-glasses-connect-2025">The next-gen Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses have longer battery life</a></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meta is launching a new version of its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/613292/meta-ray-ban-2-million-10-million-capacity-subscription-essilor-luxottica-earnings">popular Ray-Ban</a> smart glasses with an upgraded eight-hour battery life that nearly doubles that of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23922425/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">original model</a>. The second-gen smart glasses still come with a 12-megapixel ultra-wide camera, but they now support 3K video capture and allow wearers to record videos up to 60 frames per second.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Meta upgraded the charging case that comes included with the glasses, too, as it now offers an extra 48 hours of charging, up from 36 hours. There’s also a new “conversation focus” feature coming to the Ray-Ban Meta and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech-accessory-review/716360/oakley-meta-hstn-limited-edition-review-smart-glasses-wearables">Oakley Meta HSTN glasses</a> that amplifies the sound of the person speaking to you in noisy areas.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) glasses will start at $379 and are available now in the familiar Wayfarer, Skyler, and Headliner styles.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/779452/oakley-meta-vanguard-hands-on-smart-glasses-wearables">New athlete-focused AI glasses integrate with Garmin and Strava</a></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meta is partnering with Oakley to launch a new pair of smart glasses designed for “high-intensity sports.” The Oakley Meta Vanguard feature a wraparound design, an IP67 rating for water and dust resistance, along with integrations with fitness apps like Garmin and Strava, allowing you to ask Meta AI about your fitness data and stats.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Additionally, the Vanguard glasses feature a 12MP, 122-degree camera on the nose bridge, with the ability to record videos in up to 3K resolution, and they support new capture modes, like slow-motion, time-lapse, and hyperlapse, which are coming to Meta’s other AI glasses as well. Some other standout features include upgraded speakers and up to nine hours of battery life.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The Oakley Meta Vanguard glasses cost $499 and will come in four frame and lens color combinations when they launch on October 21st. Preorders are available now.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/780044/meta-quest-metaverse-hyperscape-capture-vr">Quest headsets can now put real spaces into VR</a></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meta’s new Hyperscape feature allows users wearing a Quest 3 or Quest 3S headset to scan their surroundings and transform them into a digital space. The company first showed off a demo of the feature at Meta Connect last year, but now users can try out a beta using the Hyperscape Capture app.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/780492/meta-quest-headset-horizon-tv-streaming">A new entertainment hub for Quest headsets</a></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meta is putting a new Horizon TV entertainment hub inside Quest headsets. There, you’ll find all of the streaming apps available on Quest headsets, including Prime Video, Peacock, Twitch, and YouTube. Meta announced today that Disney Plus, ESPN, and Hulu are also launching apps on the platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The Horizon TV hub supports Dolby Atmos surround sound, and Meta plans on adding Dolby Vision later this year. Some movies you watch through Horizon TV, like <em>M3GAN</em> and <em>The Black Phone</em>, will also come with “immersive special effects” that you can only see inside Quest headsets.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/780256/meta-horizon-worlds-engine-studio">The engine powering the metaverse gets a boost</a></h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Meta revealed that its Horizon Engine “powers better graphics, faster performance, and more advanced worlds.” The engine is capable of powering Meta’s new Hyperscape feature, as well as allowing for larger capacities in virtual worlds. Meta also plans on upgrading its Horizon Studio with an agentic AI assistant that helps “stitch” together its existing AI tools that help people make virtual worlds.</p>

Meta is making it easier to stream movies and TV shows on your Quest headset.

During its Meta Connect keynote on Wednesday, the company announced that it’s rolling out a Horizon TV hub with access to streaming apps like Prime Video, Peacock, Twitch, and — finally — Disney Plus with Hulu and ESPN.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The image shared by Meta shows content recommendations and streaming apps lined up on the homepage, along with tabs to switch between movies, TV shows, “immersive” experiences, sports, music, and your watchlist. It’s unclear whether the tabs will show content from all of these platforms, or just the ones you subscribe to.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">As part of the launch of Horizon TV, Meta is also partnering with Universal Pictures and Blumhouse, allowing you to watch movies like <em>The Black Phone</em> and <em>M3GAN</em> with 3D effects. Apple similarly partners with Disney to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/16/24039960/apple-vision-pro-3d-movies-disney-plus">offer 3D movies</a> on its Vision Pro headset.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meta is making improvements to its <em>Roblox</em>-like social platform <em>Horizon Worlds</em>, with the biggest upgrades being the introduction of a new game engine with better graphics as well as the Meta Horizon Studio to help creators to make custom in-game experiences.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Meta Horizon Studio is an editor that lets creators make VR worlds. Creators can already use generative AI tools to create things like textures and audio, and Meta will bring an AI assistant to the editor later this year to help creators with development. In a demo I saw at Connect 2025, a developer had a conversation with an AI chatbot to request changes like a new environment and tweaks to the personality of an AI-driven NPC.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Powering Meta’s new metaverse environments is the Horizon Engine, which “powers better graphics, faster performance, and more advanced” VR worlds, including “much greater concurrency,” according to Meta. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Horizon Worlds</em> hasn’t caught on broadly, even though it’s expanded from VR <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/25/23887494/meta-horizon-worlds-web-mobile-vr-super-rumble">to mobile</a>. But Meta is trying to get more creators on board with making things for the metaverse, including opening up a $50 million creators fund <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/616902/meta-has-a-new-fund-for-horizon-worlds-creators">earlier this year</a>.</p>

Meta is rolling out tech that lets you capture a real-world space with a Quest VR headset so you can create a digital, photorealistic VR replica. The company calls the tech “Hyperscape,” and as part of a gradual rollout beginning today, users will be able to use the beta Hyperscape Capture app with their Quest [&#8230;]

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meta is rolling out tech that lets you capture a real-world space with a Quest VR headset so you can create a digital, photorealistic VR replica. The company calls the tech “Hyperscape,” and as part of a gradual rollout beginning today, users will be able to use the <a href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/meta-horizon-hyperscape-capture-beta/8798130056953686/">beta Hyperscape Capture app</a> with their Quest 3 or Quest 3S to make the virtual copies.&nbsp;Initially, you’ll only be able to visit the rooms you’ve scanned by yourself, but Meta says that users will be able to visit rooms together by sharing a private link sometime “soon.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Meta showed off Hyperscape as part of <a href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/meta-horizon-hyperscape-demo/7972066712871980/">a demo</a> introduced at Connect 2024 last year, and while it seems like the tech is still somewhat early, it’s clear that the company sees virtual recreations of real environments as a potentially notable use case for VR and its metaverse ambitions. (Though those ambitions have seemingly taken a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/715951/mark-zuckerberg-meta-ai-superintelligence-scale-openai-letter">back seat to AI</a> as of late.) You can see a Meta-provided example of Hyperscape in the GIF below that recreates Gordon Ramsay’s home kitchen.</p>
<img src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/Gordon-Ramsays-home-kitchen_5MB.gif?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100" alt="Gordon Ramsay’s home kitchen rendered with Hyperscape." title="Gordon Ramsay’s home kitchen rendered with Hyperscape." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="&lt;em&gt;Kitchen goals.&lt;/em&gt; | GIF: Meta" data-portal-copyright="GIF: Meta" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">I toured some prescanned rooms at Connect 2025, including Ramsay’s kitchen. The rooms looked a lot like real-life rooms, and it was fun to get up close to details like food on a table or a stack of books. The illusion would break down if you got too close to things — text on a “paper” <em>New York Times</em> was readable, but sometimes a little smudgy — but overall, I was really impressed with the scans.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">I also tried a brief demo of the capture app. Wearing a Quest 3 headset, I walked and looked around a room, and as I did, a virtual mesh started to appear over objects I was facing. After about a three-minute scan of the room, the app prompted me to move closer to objects. That made the mesh start to <em>disappear</em>, which was a clever way to show what I had “scanned” in detail. But I didn’t get to finish that part before a Meta rep ended the demo.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Meta says that after you complete a full scan, it’s uploaded to the cloud to process over the course of a few hours before you can experience the scan for yourself.</p>

When the Oakley Meta HSTN arrived earlier this year, it wasn't what I thought Oakley-branded smart glasses would be. Sure, they had Oakley's famous PRIZM lenses, but where was the wraparound design?

Meta has announced a new generation of its Ray-Ban smart glasses, featuring significantly improved battery life and the ability to record 3K video, which brings them up to par with the Oakley HSTN smart glasses. The new glasses, technically called the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2, are available to order today and start at $379. Let’s [&#8230;]

The new glasses, technically called the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2, are available to order today and start at $379.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Let’s dig in on battery, which is better on a few fronts. You can use the new Ray-Bans for up to eight hours on a single charge, which is twice the four-hour battery life of the previous generation. The charging case can charge the glasses to 50 percent in 20 minutes — a slight improvement over the 22 minutes to 50 percent for the first generation. The case for the Gen 2 glasses offers an additional 48 hours of battery life, up from 32 hours. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As for the camera, you’ll be able to record 3K at 30fps, 1440p at 30fps, and 1200p at 60fps, all for up to three minutes. Later this fall, Meta will also add the ability to capture hyperlapse and slow-motion videos — a feature coming to all of its AI glasses.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Meta is adding a cool audio-focused feature called “conversation focus” down the line, too, which will use the speakers on the glasses to boost the voice of a person you’re talking with. The company is improving live translation by expanding it to support German and Portuguese.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">I tried the Gen 2 glasses at Meta’s Connect event, and there’s not much to say about them at first blush — they’re a solid upgrade on paper, but they’re ultimately still Meta Ray-Ban glasses, so if you’ve used the first generation before, you pretty much get the idea. You’ll be able to buy them in Wayfarer, Skyler, and Headliner styles. The first-generation glasses will still be available, too, starting at $299.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Disney gave in to threats from FCC chairman and occasional speech regulator Brendan Carr this evening, announcing that <em>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</em> would be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/780471/disney-abc-jimmy-kimmel-live-charlie-kirk">pulled off the air</a> “indefinitely.” Carr was unhappy that Kimmel characterized the alleged shooter of Charlie Kirk as “anything other than” a member of the “MAGA gang” and threatened to pull broadcast licenses of stations airing his show as a result.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The clip of Kimmel’s monologue that got him pulled off the air is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-j3YdxNSzTk">still available on YouTube</a>. Watch it for yourself and see if it’s so objectionable as to warrant pulling the entire show, let alone entire broadcast networks that air it.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“We hit some new lows over the weekend, with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it,” Kimmel said near the top of his monologue. The remarks come just after the 2-minute mark in the clip on YouTube.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Carr has regularly used his position as FCC chairman to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/internet-censorship/717548/brendan-carr-paramount-merger-free-speech">try to manipulate speech by broadcasters</a> that rely on his agency. He previously implied that CBS’s cancellation of Steven Colbert’s late-night show helped get the company’s merger with Paramount approved. The companies had to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/713587/paramount-skydance-merger-approved-fcc-speech-dei-bias">agree to government speech regulations</a> in order to seal the deal.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>The Verge </em>has reached out to the FCC to ask what specifically in Kimmel’s show is objectionable and which rules it is in violation of. The commission did not immediately provide comment.</p>
