In the future, Intel will make CPUs with Nvidia graphics inside — among other things, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang confirmed today that Nvidia will contribute “GPU chiplets” that Intel can place alongside its x86 CPU cores instead of the Arc integrated graphics it develops in-house today.

<p>Amazon’s Prime Big Deal Days is one of the biggest shopping events of the year, and it’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/774151/amazon-october-prime-day-fall-dates-2025">returning October 7th and 8th</a>. The two-day shopping affair will grant Prime members access to some of the best prices of the year on Amazon devices, as well as products from Sony, Sonos, Microsoft, Apple, Withings, and other well-known brands. This applies to items spanning a range of categories, including gaming peripherals, laptops, 4K TVs, phones, PC accessories, and more.</p>

</div>
<p>As always, you can count on us to publish only the best deals during Prime Big Deal Days — as well as any worthwhile ones featured at Walmart, Best Buy, Target, and other competing retailers. That said, if you want to be sure you catch any and all deals that are most important to you — or be among the first to know of certain price drops — we’ve compiled some helpful tools and advice.</p>
<p>Below, we’ve spelled out a few of our best deal-hunting tips, from how to use automated price trackers to the different ways you can set up your own personalized deal alerts. All of these methods and tools are free to use, and once you put in just a little bit of work, you can rest easy knowing that you don’t need to take much action until it comes time to make a purchase.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="bLyaxo">Use a price-tracking tool or deal aggregator</h2>
<img src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/Screenshot-2025-06-20-113327.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=2.4974253347065,0,95.005149330587,100" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="CamelCamelCamel’s extension helps you keep tabs on historical price trends with useful graphs like these. | Image: CamelCamelCamel" data-portal-copyright="Image: CamelCamelCamel" />
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="Dhsh5E"><a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/">CamelCamelCamel</a></h3>
<p>CamelCamelCamel tracks the price of every product sold on Amazon and can send you alerts only when they reach the price that’s right for you. Once a product reaches the desired price you’ve set (or goes below it), you’ll get an email about it. CamelCamelCamel <em>only </em>works for products on Amazon, so you’ll need to use one of the other methods below if you want to track price movement at Walmart, Best Buy, Target, and other retailers.</p>
<p>To track prices and get alerts via email, you’ll first need to create a free account. We also suggest installing the <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/camelizer">site’s browser extension</a>, called The Camelizer, which lets you see pricing trends on a product-by-product basis, and allows you to set your desired price without navigating away from Amazon. It’s fantastic and easy to use.</p>
<p>And, if you already have a wishlist saved on Amazon,&nbsp;<a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/wishlists/edit">you can import it</a>&nbsp;into CamelCamelCamel.</p>
<img src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25514098/Screenshot_2024_07_01_at_12.06.32_PM.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="&lt;em&gt;Slickdeals allows you to set up custom alerts for specific keywords, though finding the right parameters can be a trial and error process.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: Slickdeals" data-portal-copyright="Screenshot: Slickdeals" />
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="ARTuv7"><a href="https://slickdeals.net/deal-alerts/">Slickdeals</a></h3>
<p>Slickdeals<em> </em>aggregates some of the best deals around the internet, as discovered by its team and community of users. It’s a great place to find a curated set of deals on things you might be interested in. The site also allows you to create deal alerts based on keywords, but they work a little differently on Slickdeals<em> </em>than they do on the above sites.</p>
<p>You can type in a product name, like “Sonos Era 100” or a retailer’s name, and once it’s added to your list, you’ll be notified of a deal alert if it meets your criteria. You can set it to alert you to any deal related to your keyword, or you can filter out deals so that you’ll be notified if, for example, the deal is popular enough to make it to Slickdeals’ front page or earned a high rating from the community. Setting these keywords a little too broadly may result in frequent notification pings and emails, though, so you’ll need to use some discretion and find the right balance of how aggressively you want Slickdeals to notify you.</p>
<img src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24746563/Keepa_Extension_Screenshot.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="&lt;em&gt;Unlike the Honey extension and The Camelizer, Keepa integrates historical pricing data directly into the Amazon product listing.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: Keepa" data-portal-copyright="Screenshot: Keepa" />
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="Idgahu"><a href="https://keepa.com/#!">Keepa</a></h3>
<p>Keepa is another handy tool you can use to track and compare Amazon prices over time. Like CamelCamelCamel, Keepa provides charts that track pricing trends and will alert you when it finds a deal. You can also import any wishlists you’ve previously saved on Amazon.</p>
<p>Unlike CamelCamelCamel, however, you don’t necessarily need to create an account in order to track prices with Keepa. You just need to <a href="https://keepa.com/#!">install the extension</a>, and Keepa will automatically add a price history graph to supported product listings. The embedded extension features different tabs as well, one of which showcases pricing history and another that allows you to specify various pricing details. Once you’ve set your desired price, you’ll then receive price alerts via email, push notification, or RSS.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="QdCPHz">Set up deal alert notifications through Alexa or the Amazon app</h2>
<p>If you’re a Prime member who owns a fourth-gen Echo speaker or a newer model, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/31/23005049/amazon-alexa-upcoming-deal-recommendations-feature">you can also request</a> that Amazon send you deal notifications up to 24 hours ahead of time on products you’re interested in. Amazon can alert you of price drops on eligible products in your shopping cart or wishlist, as well as anything you’ve marked as “saved for later.” To enable the feature, tap More &gt; Settings &gt; Notifications in the Alexa app, and then tap Amazon Shopping.&nbsp;Then, scroll down to Shopping Recommendations and enable&nbsp;Deal Recommendations. Once done, you’ll receive a notification on both your device and your Echo speaker (the latter in the form of a yellow ring) notifying you of the deal.</p>
<p>Alternatively, <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/finding-amazon-prime-day-deals">you can sign up to receive deal alerts</a> regarding products you’ve recently viewed in the Amazon Shopping app, as well as those related to your recent search history. If you’re a Prime member, you just need to navigate to the Prime Day event page in the mobile app between now and July 8th to create an alert. Once done, you’ll receive push notifications for any deal(s) you’ve subscribed to when the event begins. You can also just open the Amazon Shopping app and tap Settings &gt; Notifications &gt; Deals and Recommendations before toggling “Savings” and / or “Recommendations.”</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="9ADpfL">Look for deals outside of Amazon</h2>
<p>Prime Day is meant to show off Amazon’s huge retail presence, so, naturally, other retail chains take notice. Because of this, you can sometimes find better deals at retailers like Target, Walmart, and Best Buy. At the very least, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570383/price-matching-policy-apple-google-microsoft">they may be able to match Amazon’s pricing if you ask</a>.</p>
<p>If Amazon’s upcoming sale doesn’t have everything you want or if you just want to make sure you’re getting the best deal, shop around a bit. In the past, Target, Walmart, and Best Buy have hosted their own events in an effort to counter Amazon. And as usual, you’ll be able to find <a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals">all of our deals coverage in and outside of Amazon here</a>.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="y9lH70">Trust the experts</h2>
<p>We’re a discerning bunch here at&nbsp;<em>The Verge</em>, so don’t fret if you’re going into this without any prep. We’ll be corralling the best tech deals and keeping our coverage up to date in the run-up to the main event. So mark October 7th on your calendar,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/21493780/amazon-prime-sign-up-day-deals-sale-price-free">sign up for Amazon Prime</a> and our <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/20/24249294/verge-deals-newsletter-subscribe-tech-discounts">new and improved</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pages/newsletters">Verge Deals newsletter</a>, and maybe start putting aside a little spending cash.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Today, the CEO of Hyundai sought to distance his company from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/778334/trump-ice-hyundai-raid-korean-workers?utm_source=flipboard&amp;utm_content=topic%2Fsouthkorea">the Immigration and Customs Enforcement raid earlier this month</a> at the company’s battery factory in Georgia, which resulted in the arrest of hundreds of South Korean workers.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The factory is operated by LG Energy Solutions, and most of the workers that were detained were employed by suppliers for that company, not Hyundai, José Muñoz said in a briefing with reporters on Thursday <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/780980/hyundai-investor-day-erev-hybrid-metaplant">after the automaker’s CEO Investor Day event in New York City</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“I could not believe what I saw because I would have known, probably before the news,” Muñoz said, when asked about his initial reaction to the raid. “So I said, something is weird here. How can something happen [and] nobody told me?&nbsp; And when I go into the details, then I realize it&#8217;s not our facility. It’s LG’s battery plant.”</p>
<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“So I said, something is weird here.”</p></blockquote></figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“It&#8217;s like something happened in Fox News,” he continued, in response to a question from a CNN reporter. “And they said, ‘How come you didn&#8217;t know?‘ I said, ’Hey, I&#8217;m working for CNN,’ right? So same deal.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Muñoz griped that all the media’s photos of the raid have shown Hyundai’s Metaplant facility rather than the neighboring LG factory. “All the pictures that were shown everywhere, they are pictures of a facility which is different from where the raid happened,” he said.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">His remarks come a few days after he confirmed that the plant’s construction would be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/electric-cars/776809/hyundai-battery-factory-faces-delays-after-ice-raid">delayed two to three months</a> due to labor shortages. And they come amid the growing fallout from the September 4th raid, which resulted in the arrest of 475 workers, most of whom were from South Korea, at the battery plant that is jointly operated by Hyundai and LG Energy Solutions.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">President Donald Trump has sought to placate South Korea after the raid, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/world/asia/south-korea-human-rights-abuses-hyundai-raid-trump-foreign-workers-rcna231289">announcing</a> that he will allow foreign companies to temporarily bring in “people of expertise” to train American workers. But critics say the damage may already have been done, as foreign companies now realize their own workers could get rounded up in Trump’s immigration crackdown.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The Hyundai-LG raid was so unusual because it seemed to target a fairly typical situation. When opening a new facility in the US, foreign automakers typically bring a cadre of their own employees to help with the construction and then, once it’s completed, train American workers to operate it. Labor experts warn that the ICE raid in Georgia could chill foreign investment in the US and target particular industries, especially automakers working on EVs.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Muñoz defended the foreign workers who were in Georgia to help build the factory, arguing that the expertise to build these specialized factories doesn’t exist in the US. And he called for the creation of a new type of visa for highly skilled workers who help develop these enormous projects, to ensure future raids don’t happen.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“I think the US government has acknowledged that there needs to be a better solution to address this type of situation,” he said. “I think both governments in South Korea and the US are working actively to try to ensure that situations like this don&#8217;t happen again.”</p>

<p>Buying the right laptop can be stressful. It’s likely one of the bigger tech purchases you’ll make, and there are a ludicrous number of models, sizes, form factors, and configurations to pick from. We <a href="https://www.theverge.com/laptop-review">review and test a wide swath</a> of them here at <em>The Verge</em>, and we’re constantly considering what’s the best and who it’s best for.</p>
<p>Our overall pick for most people has been, and continues to be, the MacBook Air — particularly, as of March 2025, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/627186/apple-macbook-air-m4-13-15-inch-2025-laptop-review">M4 model</a>. Unless you’re forced to use Windows for specific software needs or you fancy yourself a hardcore gamer, it remains the best option for the average user who wants something portable with excellent battery life and great performance for productivity tasks.</p>
<p>Though the MacBook Air is the easy recommendation for most people, that doesn’t make it the answer for everyone. What if you need more power for video or photo editing, or crunching large datasets? What if you prefer to run Windows? What if you play lots of games and want to take them with you? Or what if you just want something unique — or even, gasp, repairable? We’ve got some recommendations, including a Chromebook or two, a laptop with two screens, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24319419/apple-macbook-pro-m4-max-pro-review-price-specs">16-inch MacBook Pro</a>, and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24185462/microsoft-surface-laptop-7th-edition-review">Microsoft Surface Laptop</a> with a Snapdragon X Elite chip.</p>

<p>Apple’s <a href="https://apple.sjv.io/raDEEQ">M4 MacBook Air</a> is the best laptop for most people — Mac users, of course, but also the platform-agnostic or anyone who wants a no-fuss, straightforward machine that doesn’t bombard them with advertisements or bloatware. It’s a productivity laptop that can do a bit of everything. The 13-inch model starts with 16GB of RAM at $999, and it also comes in a 15-inch version for $1,199, for those who like their laptops a little larger. It’s hard to find another laptop that offers this kind of combination of performance and battery life in a thin and light chassis, especially at these prices.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/22734645/apple-macbook-pro-2021-ports-magsafe-touch-bar-usb-c-future">Despite losing its way around the mid-2010s</a>, Apple has a long history of sending quality MacBooks to market, and the Air M4 is no different. A smooth, almost ethereal trackpad, check. A chiclet-style keyboard that makes typing feel like a dance, check. Fast Wi-Fi adapter, color-rich display, and MagSafe charging, check. Those were also true on the previous models, but now with the M4 generation it also features the same 12-megapixel Center Stage webcam of the MacBook Pros, can use two external monitors with its lid open, and comes in a sky blue color (though it still looks silver in some light). And again, you get all this for <em>less</em> money than before. </p>
<p>The M4 Air is a great option for just about anyone who doesn’t need video editing, heavy gaming, or more than two USB-C ports. For those that do, look to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24289831/apple-macbook-pro-m4-review-14-2024-laptop-specs-benchmarks">14-inch MacBook Pro M4</a> — a great bang-for-your-buck laptop in its own right at $1,599. Opting for a Pro over an Air is best for students in creative fields and content creators needing more headroom and features like a third USB-C port, an SD card slot, and an even better screen.</p>
<img src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/257607_M4_MacBook_Air_ADiBenedetto_0001.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="&lt;em&gt;The Apple MacBook Air M4 is the best laptop of 2024.&lt;/em&gt;" data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Now that the M4 Air is here, Apple has fully discontinued the M3 and M2 models. You might still be able to find them at retailers like <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-macbook-air-13-inch-apple-m2-chip-built-for-apple-intelligence-16gb-memory-256gb-ssd-midnight/6602763.p?skuId=6602763">Best Buy</a>, but they’re not worth it over the M4 unless substantially discounted. If you can afford an additional $200 on top of either the 13- or 15-inch M4 Air’s starting prices, that’ll net you 512GB of storage instead of 256GB — as well as the 10-core GPU on the 13-inch. The paltry base storage is the only remaining weak point of the MacBook Air. It’s definitely worth getting more, as the roomier SSD will make your life a little easier on a laptop that should easily last you five to seven (or even more) years.</p>

<p><em><em><sub><strong>CPU: </strong>MediaTek Kompanio Ultra 910 / <strong>GPU:</strong> Immortalis G925 / <strong>RAM:</strong> 16GB LPDDR5X / <strong>Storage:</strong> 256GB UFS 4.0 / <strong>Display: </strong>Touch 14-inch FHD 1920 x 1200, 60Hz OLED, 400 nits / <strong>Dimensions: </strong>12.37 x 8.63 x 0.62 inches<strong> </strong>/ <strong>Weight: </strong>2.78 pounds&nbsp;</sub></em></em></p>
<p>Lenovo’s Chromebook Plus 14 is the best model we’ve tested so far in 2025 because of its impressive tech specs and long software support. It has a 14-inch FHD (1920 x 1200) 60Hz OLED touchscreen display that has excellent color and contrast, as well as 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD. Its 8-core MediaTek Kompanio Ultra 910 processor was powerful enough that we could jump between Chrome tabs and Android apps spread across two desktops while uploading documents to NotebookLM to generate audio overviews without any problems. </p>
<p>Lenovo equipped this laptop with two USB-C ports, which can drive a couple of monitors simultaneously, and a USB-A port that’s convenient for connecting accessories without the need for a dongle. All three ports top out at 5Gbps each though, which might be slower than you need. We were impressed by the laptop’s speakers, which sounded great when listening to music or audiobooks, even at a high volume. Its keyboard was comfortable to type on, but the mechanical trackpad makes an annoying, loud click when pressed. </p>
<p>The Chromebook Plus 14 can run Android, Linux, and web apps. You should be able to easily find the right software across those platforms, but we still ran into trouble with Zoom, which ran poorly as a web app <em>and</em> as an Android app. Similarly, we had to run Slack in a browser window because the Linux app wasn’t compiled for Arm processors. The types of apps you use will also heavily impact battery life. We were able to run the laptop for around nine hours and only drained its battery by around 50 percent. We suspect you could use it for a couple of days without charging if your needs aren’t incredibly demanding.</p>
<p>Software support is an understandable concern when getting a new laptop, but Google has guaranteed Chromebooks released after 2021 will receive <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/14/23873319/google-chromebook-chrome-os-automatic-security-updates">10 years of automatic updates</a>. The Lenovo Chromebook 14’s solid hardware and extended software support means you may be able to keep it running for a decade, even if later becomes a secondary machine or hand-me-down. </p>

Microsoft was obviously gunning for Apple’s MacBook Air, and the Surface Laptop mostly delivers that level of hardware experience for a Windows machine. It’s the full package if you want a thin-and-light productivity machine running Windows that easily lasts all day and into the night. And if your budget is slightly tighter, there’s a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/671554/microsoft-surface-laptop-13-inch-review">13-inch model</a> with pared-down features starting at $899 that’s still really good.</p>
<p>The greater concern with Snapdragon X-equipped laptops is whether Windows on Arm supports all the apps you need to get your work done. Most everyday apps work fine, via native Arm versions or emulation, but there can still be some outliers, especially in content creation apps. Also, if you like the idea of your productivity machine being able to pull light gaming duties (one of Windows’ advantages over Mac) then you’re likely better off with a laptop using Intel’s Lunar Lake or AMD’s Ryzen AI chips. Snapdragon X laptops can only run a fraction of the games you find on Steam, and Microsoft is just beginning to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/758828/microsoft-windows-on-arm-xbox-app-download-feature">roll out the ability</a> to install ARM64-compatible games from the Xbox app. In many cases you’ll only be able to stream games available in the PC Game Pass library.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Earlier this year, Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/601205/microsoft-surface-pro-11-surface-laptop-7-intel-lunar-lake-release-date-pricing">launched Intel Lunar Lake- based versions</a> of the Surface Laptop 7, but they’re a ridiculous $500 more expensive, and aimed solely at businesses. It’s a shame, because having this hardware with Lunar Lake’s compatibility might have been an appealing prospect. </p>

<p>The 16-inch Asus Zenbook S 16 is the best-looking, best-performing Windows laptop we’ve tested so far; it’s also so thin and lightweight you wouldn’t know it just by holding it! It can handle a little bit of everything, from emails to graphic design work, and it tackles gaming surprisingly well for a laptop without a separate graphics card. It’s a lovely, catch-all device.</p>
<p>There are only two Zenbook S 16 models as of now. The $1,800 one comes in gray with AMD’s flagship Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 chip and 32GB of memory, and the $1,400 model comes in white with the lower-tier AMD Ryzen AI 9 365 and 24GB of memory. Otherwise, they are identical. Both feature OLED touch displays with a native 2880 x 1800 (3K) resolution and 120Hz refresh rate, stylus support, 1TB of storage, and the same ports / Wi-Fi adapter. Everything but the Windows version. (The more expensive model gets Home; the cheaper one gets Pro.)</p>
<p>At just 11 hours, its battery life doesn’t last as long as similar laptops we’ve tested, such as the Samsung Galaxy Book4 Edge and Dell XPS 14, but it’s a small tradeoff. There’s still no other Windows laptop that offers as much performance and versatility in a 16-inch chassis for the price.</p>

<p>I’m still testing a handful of different gaming laptops, including the <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/lenovo-legion-pro-7i-16-oled-gaming-laptop-intel-core-ultra-9-275hx-32gb-memory-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5080-2-tb-ssd-eclipse-black/6617088.p?skuId=6617088">Lenovo Legion Pro 7i Gen 10</a> and <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/hp-omen-max-16-oled-240hz-gaming-laptop-intel-core-ultra-9-32gb-ddr5-memory-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5080-2tb-ssd-shadow-black/6615951.p?skuId=6615951">HP Omen Max 16</a>, but the frontrunner so far (by a nose) is the Asus ROG Strix Scar 16 with an Nvidia RTX 5080 GPU. From what I’ve seen so far, the 5080 is the sweet spot for high-end gaming laptops in this generation. The 5080 ROG Strix Scar is within earshot of the 5090 performance I saw in the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/649577/razer-blade-16-2025-rtx-5090-review">Razer Blade 16</a>, and it’s $1,200 cheaper. The Asus is chunky and heavy compared to Razer’s svelte Blade, but that gives its GPU the space it needs to stay cool. Thinner laptops often thermally constrain a high-end chip like the 5090.</p>
<p>The ROG Strix Scar doesn’t have an OLED display like its direct competitors, which is indeed a bummer, but its 2560 x 1600 240Hz Mini LED panel is still sharp and bright, with some punchy colors. The 16-inch version of the Strix Scar eschews a number pad, giving its large keycaps plenty of space so typing isn’t cramped at all. Its trackpad is massive, and it houses a hidden touch-sensitive numpad you can call up with a long-press in the top corner — though it’s more useful for data entry than gaming needs.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The Strix Scar’s boisterous RGB light show is kind of fun in its garishness. In addition to wraparound underglow, it has a dot-matrix array of LEDs on its lid to display animations — as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/29/21306808/asus-zephyrus-g14-dot-matrix-display-release-date-price-specs-features">Asus has done before</a>. A more useful feature is the way you can open up the laptop’s bottom plate like the hood of a car for easy, tool-free access to its two RAM slots and SSDs.</p>

<p>If you need power for intensive creative work — like 3D rendering and working with ultra-high-resolution photos and video — the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24319419/apple-macbook-pro-m4-max-pro-review-price-specs">MacBook Pro</a> is your best bet. Both the 14- and 16-inch models are available with powerful M4 Pro or M4 Max processors. There’s also a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24289831/apple-macbook-pro-m4-review-14-2024-laptop-specs-benchmarks">14-inch Pro with a standard M4 processor</a>, and while it’s a formidable step up from the MacBook Air as an everyman’s “pro” laptop, the M4 Pro and Max processors still outclass it in performance.</p>
<p>Processors aside, the MacBook Pro has remained largely unchanged since 2021. It has a bright, beautiful, color-accurate, high-res screen with HDR and an adaptive refresh rate of up to 120Hz; amazing speakers, a comfortable keyboard and trackpad; and a good port loadout: three Thunderbolt 5 / USB-C ports, plus HDMI 2.1 and an SD card slot. The 14-inch MacBook Pro is a few hundred dollars cheaper than the 16-inch, but aside from the very lowest processor options, most configurations are available in either size, so pick whichever works for you.</p>
<p>In our benchmarks, which test a variety of creative tasks including encoding, playback, and export time, the MacBook Pro 16 did better than any laptop we’ve ever used — the only other machines that have come close to matching this thing in some of our benchmarks are high-end desktop PCs. The battery life is also record-shattering. The top-of-the-line <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24319419/apple-macbook-pro-m4-max-pro-review-price-specs">16-inch M4 Max model</a> easily lasted all day in our most recent testing, with no battery-saving features enabled and even keeping the screen on full-time.</p>
<p>Most people who need much more power than a MacBook Air — including all but the most demanding pro photographers — will be fine with an M4 Pro model, which starts at $1,999 for the 14-inch with a 12-core CPU, 16-core GPU, 24GB of memory, and a 512GB SSD. The 16-inch starts at $2,499 for a 14-core CPU, 20-core GPU, 24GB of memory, and 512GB SSD. The M4 Pro chip can be configured with up to 48GB of memory and a 4TB SSD, at the usual absurd Apple markups, and it supports up to two external 6K displays.</p>
<p>If you absolutely need more GPU power — or more than two external monitors — you can step up to the M4 Max. The base M4 Max with 14 CPU cores and 32 GPU cores, plus 36GB of RAM and 1TB SSD, starts at $3,199 in the 14-inch and $3,499 in the 16-inch. There’s also an M4 Max with 16 CPU and 40 GPU cores, which starts at $3,699 and $3,999, respectively. The M4 Max models are configurable with up to 128GB of RAM and 8TB of storage and can support up to four external monitors. The vast majority of people don’t have workloads heavy enough to notice a significant difference between the M4 Pro and M4 Max; if you do, you probably know it.</p>

<p>Asus recently introduced an updated ROG Zephyrus G14 for 2025, which replaces the previous model as our pick for the best 14-inch gaming laptop. It retains the sleek design Asus <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24155889/razer-blade-14-2024-asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-comparison">introduced last year</a> and continues to strike a balance between power and portability; it also incorporates a handful of improvements, some of which have allowed it to earn the top spot in our <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22295181/best-gaming-laptop">best gaming laptops guide</a>, despite a $100 price bump. </p>
<p>The updated Zephyrus G14 has an AMD 9-series processor and Nvidia RTX 50-series graphics chip, which provide modest performance gains. Every configuration features a handsome, high-res OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate, so smoother gameplay isn’t locked behind an optional upgrade. Conveniently, the <strong>2025</strong> G14 features USB-C ports on both sides for charging, although you’ll still achieve the maximum wattage by using Asus’ proprietary charger. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The G14 features a backlit, chiclet-style keyboard, and Asus has increased the keycap size by 12.24 percent to make them easier to press. The centered trackpad is also relatively wide, providing ample space for clicks, taps, and swipes without cramping your hand. These features are as useful for typing and productivity work as they are for playing games when you’re not connected to a gaming keyboard and mouse. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Speaking of games, the titles we played ran well, even on high settings, but the laptop felt hot to the touch due to its thin chassis. Its fans were audible under heavy load, and the laptop eventually thermally throttled its GPUs to prevent overheating. The tradeoffs aren’t surprising, though, especially given the G14’s thin, lightweight design.</p>

<p>A dual-screen laptop is exactly what it sounds like: a laptop with a second screen where the keyboard normally goes.</p>
<p>The Lenovo Yoga Book 9i has a 360-degree hinge, which lets you use it as a regular laptop, a (large) tablet, and more. You can put it in clamshell mode and write or sketch on the bottom screen with a stylus or fold the keyboard folio into a stand to prop it up and take advantage of both screens. You can set it up at home with an external monitor as a three-screen desktop replacement, or take it on the go with the included Bluetooth keyboard and mouse. Its touchscreen gestures are super responsive but too responsive for the virtual keyboard and trackpad. It’s easy to mistype and accidentally minimize windows.</p>
<p>The Yoga Book’s only real competitor is Asus’ Zenbook Duo. The Duo’s physical keyboard includes a trackpad and makes it look a lot more like a traditional laptop. Its 14-inch OLED screens are a little bigger and brighter, it has a ton of port options, it’s more powerful, and it’s a little easier to fold up and put away. But it’s also heavier (at 3.64 pounds), its top lid doesn’t fold back far enough to use it as a tablet, and its touchscreen gestures aren’t as responsive.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s no other laptop offering the kind of nerdy fun today that a Framework is. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/650608/framework-laptop-13-review-2025-amd-ryzen-ai-300">Framework Laptop 13</a> isn’t just the only game in town when it comes to a notebook that’s fully repairable and upgradeable, it’s also a great productivity machine for everyday use and has been for several years now. For 2025, the Laptop 13 gets a processor upgrade with AMD’s “Strix Point” Ryzen AI chips, giving it higher performance than the last-gen Intel and AMD offerings with serviceable battery life. Otherwise, it’s much the same chassis as the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23911664/framework-laptop-13-2023-amd-review">prior generation</a> — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/650608/framework-laptop-13-review-2025-amd-ryzen-ai-300#:~:text=The%20new%20AMD%20Framework%2013%20atop%20the%20last%2Dgen%20AMD%20and%20Intel%20models.%20If%20not%20for%20the%20orange%20USB%2DC%20port%20even%20I%20wouldn%E2%80%99t%20be%20able%20to%20tell%20them%20apart.">they’re indistinguishable</a> from one another.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But that’s part of what’s so cool about a Framework: a new model means a new chip you can even put into the <em>old </em>model, if you want an upgrade and don’t mind opening up the chassis yourself. It’s actually much easier to do than you may fear, as Framework designs its laptops to give you full access to everything inside with just a simple screwdriver; including its mainboard, storage, RAM, battery, and some fun see-through bezels for a touch of customization. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">If you opt for one of Framework’s DIY Editions it only comes partially built, but this allows you to choose from many more configuration options than its pre-builts. Personally, I think the DIY route is the way to go if you’re up for it, because experiencing the assembly (which took me less than 30 minutes) gives you a better awareness of what’s in your laptop and how to change something if you ever need to repair or upgrade it. But even if you choose a pre-built, you can pick from a wide array of modular ports to outfit it with.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Laptop 13 isn’t as sleek as a similarly priced MacBook or Surface, which offer no upgradeability or modularity (aside from the SSD on some Surface Laptops), but the Framework by no means feels cheap. It’s thin enough and light enough to be very portable, and it’s got a great keyboard with a fine trackpad. Its screen has a 3:2 aspect ratio that’s ideal for productivity since you can see a bit more than the more typical 16:10.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">You probably have to be really into the whole repairability and modularity concept to spend the same or more on a Framework Laptop 13 compared to other options out there, but anyone can appreciate picking your ports and being able to swap them around whenever you want.</p>
<h5 class="wp-block-heading" id="cPtIn9">Read our <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/650608/framework-laptop-13-review-2025-amd-ryzen-ai-300">Framework Laptop 13 (2025) review</a>.</h5>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none" id="what-s-new">What’s new</h3>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>We’ve recently <a href="https://www.theverge.com/hands-on/769834/acer-chromebook-plus-spin-514-2in1-mediatek-kompanio-ifa-2025-price-specs">gone hands-on</a> with Acer’s Chromebook Plus Spin 514, which was announced at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/767912/ifa-2025-news-tech-gadgets-products-updates-highlights">IFA 2025</a> and will be available later this month for $699.99. The machine runs on a power-efficient MediaTek Kompanio Ultra processor paired with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of UFS 4.0 flash storage. Its 14-inch touchscreen has a resolution of 1920 x 1200 or 2880 x 1800 depending on your configuration. The screen can be flipped 360 degrees, so you can use the Chromebook as a tablet. You can also spec it with either a 1080p or 5-megapixel webcam. The laptop is equipped with a pair of 10GBps USB-C ports with DisplayPort and Power Delivery, two USB-A 3.2 Gen 2 ports, and a 3.5mm audio jack. </li>
<li>We were able to put Framework’s GPU upgrade claims to the test by swapping out an AMD Radeon RX 7700S for Nvidia’s RTX 5070 on a Framework 16 laptop. The swap was conducted in Framework’s office on a laptop they provided (our review unit would’ve required BIOS and software updates that aren’t publicly available yet), but it only <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/768083/framework-actually-did-it-i-upgraded-a-laptops-entire-gpu-in-just-three-minutes">took us three minutes</a>. The graphics card upgrade costs $699 and will be available in December. The company also introduced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/765542/framework-240w-usb-c-pd-charger-first-framework-16">a 240W USB-C charger</a>, which also ships in December and is available for <a href="https://frame.work/products/power-adapter-240w?v=FRAKMW000B">preorder now</a>.</li>
<li>Lenovo showed off the ThinkBook VertiFlex Concept, a prototype 14-inch laptop with a screen that can be rotated into portrait orientation, at IFA 2025. It seems like the perfect follow-up to the ThinkBook Plus Gen 6, Lenovo’s laptop with a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/717491/lenovo-thinkbook-plus-gen-6-rollable-laptop-review">rollable display</a> that was released earlier in the summer. Lenovo wasn’t forthcoming about the laptop’s specific specs, but we noticed it had two Thunderbolt ports, one USB-A port, an HDMI port, and 3.5mm audio jack during our demo. Lenovo did share that the laptop weighs 3.06 pounds and is 0.7 inches thick. </li>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It's the Haribo-licensed gummy bear power bank. It's the lightest-ever 20,000mAH power bank, it's got a gummy-bear themed built-in USB-C cord, and it's taking over the ultralight backpacking world. The specs say it weighs 9.9 ounces - and in a world where ounces count, that's a big deal.</p>

Ubiquiti has announced a collection of new storage solutions compatible with its UniFi lineup of networking devices that already includes routers, switches, and security cameras. Compared to other desktop network attached storage (NAS) solutions from companies like Synology and Ugreen, Ubiquiti’s UNAS 2 and UNAS 4 look more like sleek wireless routers than storage solutions [&#8230;]

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ubiquiti has <a href="https://blog.ui.com/article/all-new-next-gen-of-unifi-storage">announced a collection of new storage solutions</a> compatible with its UniFi lineup of networking devices that already includes routers, switches, and security cameras. Compared to other desktop network attached storage (NAS) solutions from companies like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/652364/synology-nas-third-party-hard-drive-restrictions">Synology</a> and <a href="https://nas.ugreen.com/?no_rule=true">Ugreen</a>, Ubiquiti’s UNAS 2 and UNAS 4 look more like sleek wireless routers than storage solutions stuffed full of hard drives and SSDs.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The entry-level <a href="https://store.ui.com/us/en/category/network-storage/products/unas-2?variant=unas-2-w">UNAS 2 is now available in a black or white finish for $199</a> and accommodates a pair of 3.5-inch hard drives in a RAID 1 configuration. To achieve the minimal design, the drives are inserted using an access panel on the underside of the NAS which includes a sliding locking mechanism to ensure they don’t fall out while it’s standing upright. There’s a 5 Gbps USB-C port on the front for attaching additional external storage, but otherwise the UNAS 2 requires just a single ethernet cable connected to a device like a switch that supports power over ethernet (POE) delivery. If your setup is lacking one, the UNAS 2 comes with a 60W POE adapter.</p>
<img src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/unas2.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100" alt="Hard drives being inserted into the Ubiquiti UNAS 2 NAS device." title="Hard drives being inserted into the Ubiquiti UNAS 2 NAS device." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="&lt;em&gt;Hard drives are inserted into the underside of the UNAS 2 with a locking access panel.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Ubiquiti" data-portal-copyright="Image: Ubiquiti" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">The UNAS 2 also includes a 1.45-inch screen on the front showing real-time performance and storage metrics, but if you need even more networked storage sitting on your desk, the UNAS 4 may be a better fit if you don’t mind sacrificing a bit more space. It’s <a href="https://store.ui.com/us/en/category/network-storage/products/unas-4">expected to ship later this year for $379</a> and while it features a similar design and functionality as the UNAS 2, it’s much larger and can accommodate up to four 2.5-inch or 3.5-inch hard drives plus a pair of M.2 NVMe SSD drives. Although Ubiquiti’s rack-mounted NAS solutions offer more capacity and RAID options, the company hasn’t yet shared what RAID configurations the UNAS 4 will support, or if like the UNAS 2 it will be limited to RAID 1.</p>
