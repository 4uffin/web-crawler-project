<![CDATA[Trump claims the US is about to get a tremendous fee for taking TikTok out of China]]>

A 10 percent stake in Intel, 15 percent of Nvidia’s China sales, a “golden share” of Nippon Steel — what price will Trump extract next in exchange for favorable treatment? Well, The Wall Street Journal is reporting that the Trump Administration is “expected to collect a multibillion-dollar fee” in exchange for negotiating a US takeover [&#8230;]

<p class="has-text-align-none">A <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/764480/intel-donald-trump-lip-bu-tan-deal">10 percent stake in Intel</a>, 15 percent <a href="https://www.theverge.com/regulator-newsletter/757996/trump-screwed-over-nvidias-chinese-sales-then-let-them-happen">of Nvidia’s China sales</a>, a “golden share” of Nippon Steel — what price will Trump extract next in exchange for favorable treatment? Well, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/deals/u-s-government-expected-to-get-multibillion-dollar-fee-in-tiktok-deal-685e3944?st=Z4pVCZ&amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em> is reporting</a> that the Trump Administration is “expected to collect a multibillion-dollar fee” in exchange for negotiating a US takeover of TikTok’s US business.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">That fee will reportedly come from TikTok’s US investors, including private equity firm Silver Lake and Oracle, with the new group getting half of TikTok, while TikTok China’s parent company ByteDance would still have under 20 percent.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Yesterday, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOwC4q7kYpg/">Trump said that</a> “the United States is getting a tremendous fee-plus, I call it a ‘fee-plus,’ just for making the deal.” But Trump <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/738172/trump-threatens-100-percent-tariff-on-computer-chips-with-a-gigantic-loophole">says a lot of things that need dissecting</a>, and it was absolutely unclear today <a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/781967/tiktok-deal-us-china-still-ambiguous">whether there’s even a TikTok deal or not</a>.
</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">So to see the <em>WSJ</em> reporting that “people familiar with the matter” think a deal might not only get approved, but also see billions of dollars flow from US companies into the Trump Administration’s coffers, sounds like something to be aware of.
Why would those companies pay Trump’s government billions unless they think they’ll make even more? </p>

Microsoft is raising the prices of its Xbox Series S / X consoles in the US next month. The Xbox Series X will be priced at $649.99 in the US starting October 3rd, up from its existing $599.99 price. The Xbox Series S will move to $399.99, up from $379.99. Microsoft blames the price hikes [&#8230;]

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/hardware-network/console/may-2025-pricing-updates">Microsoft blames</a> the price hikes on “changes in the macroeconomic environment,” which is a lot of words to say: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/607947/donald-trump-tariffs-china-mexico-canada-explainer">tariffs</a>. Xbox console pricing outside the US will remain the same. Thankfully, pricing for controllers and headsets will remain in the same in the US. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The price rises mean Xbox Series S consoles will increase by $20, Xbox Series X consoles by $50, and the 2TB Galaxy Black Special Edition Xbox Series X is increasing by $70 all the way up to $799.99.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Here’s the full list of price increases in the US:</p>
<figure class="wp-block-vox-media-table"><table><tbody><tr><td>Product</td><td>New US price (RRP)</td><td>Previous US price (RRP)</td></tr><tr><td>Xbox Series S (512GB)</td><td>$399.99</td><td>$379.99</td></tr><tr><td>Xbox Series S (1TB)</td><td>$449.99</td><td>$429.99</td></tr><tr><td>Xbox Series X</td><td>$649.99</td><td>$599.99</td></tr><tr><td>Xbox Series X Digital</td><td>$599.99</td><td>$549.99</td></tr><tr><td>Xbox Series X 2TB Galaxy Black Special Edition</td><td>$799.99</td><td>$729.99</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Microsoft only just raised the prices of its Xbox products <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659430/microsoft-xbox-console-controller-game-price-increases-worldwide">worldwide in May</a>, with price hikes to the Xbox Series S / X consoles, controllers, and headsets. Those previous price increases already bumped the Xbox Series X up by $100, and the Xbox Series S by $80. Coupled with today’s announcement, that means the Xbox Series X has increased in price in the US by $150 and the Series S by $100 in just six months.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Microsoft’s Xbox Series X 2TB Galaxy Black Special Edition originally <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/21/24225188/microsoft-white-xbox-series-x-digital-2tb-special-edition-release-dates">debuted nearly a year ago</a> at $599.99, and it’s now about to be $799.99 — a $200 increase in just a year. Microsoft’s latest price increases are the second this year, following <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/21/23768400/microsoft-xbox-series-x-xbox-game-pass-price-increase">initial price hikes in 2023</a>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Microsoft also planned to hike the price of some of its first-party Xbox games to $80 this holiday, but then <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/712371/the-outer-worlds-2-price-change-microsoft-xbox">walked back those changes in July</a>.</p>

Ugreen has released a new wallet tracker that’s just as thin as the FineTrack Slim Smart Finder the company debuted earlier this year, but with a massive boost in battery life from 12 months to five years. However, while the previous version was compatible with Apple’s Find My network and recharable, the new FineTrack Slim [&#8230;]

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ugreen has released a new wallet tracker that’s just as thin as the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/604094/ugreen-finder-slim-thin-wallet-card-tracker-rechargeable-apple-find-my-network">FineTrack Slim Smart Finder the company debuted earlier this year</a>, but with a massive boost in battery life from 12 months to five years. However, while the previous version was compatible with Apple’s Find My network and recharable, the new FineTrack Slim Smart G only works with Google’s Find Hub network and lacks charging capabilities and a replaceable battery. When it dies, you’re left with a credit card-sized piece of e-waste. You can <a href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-FineTrack-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Ultra-Slim/dp/B0FBWBDB1Q/ref=sr_1_3?">find it on Amazon for $25.99</a>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">At 1.7mm thick – roughly the same thickness of two credit cards – the FineTrack Slim Smart G is thinner than competitor’s wallet trackers including the 2.5mm <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tile.com%2Fproduct%2Fblack-slim&amp;xcust=__vg0919awD__604094__________________theverge.com">Tile Slim</a> which also lacks charging capabilities and is limited to three years of use. With 12 months of battery life between top-ups, Ugreen’s older rechargeable FineTrack Slim will definitely outlast this new Android-only version, but every wallet tracker will eventually become e-waste when their non-replaceable batteries stop taking a charge. In five years’ time you’ll probably be eager to upgrade to the latest tracking technology anyways.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Other features include IP68 dust and waterproofing so the FineTrack Slim Smart G can survive dunks to up to 1.5 meters for up to 30 minutes, although it will be completely untrackable while submerged. It also has a built-in 80dB alarm that will potentially make it easier to locate the tracker when Google’s Find Hub app tells you it’s nearby but your wallet is in a pair of pants buried in a pile of dirty laundry.</p>

China and the US have “made progress” on granting permission for ByteDance to sell TikTok to an American consortium, fulfilling a nine-months-overdue legal requirement.

<p class="has-text-align-none">China and the US have “made progress” on granting permission for ByteDance to sell TikTok to an American consortium, fulfilling a nine-months-overdue legal requirement. After saying a tentative deal had been reached Monday and that approval would come Friday, President Donald Trump’s administration has issued an update that leaves the current status ambiguous and the details bare-bones.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“I just completed a very productive call with President Xi of China. We made progress on many very important issues including Trade, Fentanyl, the need to bring the War between Russia and Ukraine to an end, and the approval of the TikTok Deal,” Trump <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115231649861246548">posted on Truth Social</a>, noting he and Xi Jinping would meet at the APEC Summit in Korea in October. “The call was a very good one, we will be speaking again by phone, appreciate the TikTok approval, and both look forward to meeting at APEC!”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“Appreciate the TikTok approval” makes Xi’s benediction sound like a done deal. “We made progress,” however, does not.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">TikTok posted an <a href="https://x.com/tiktokpolicy/status/1969077433916707241?s=46&amp;t=VV0AVA0CrjIVi5Bm6hwA8g">equivocal response on X</a>. “We thank President Xi Jinping and President Donald J. Trump for their efforts to preserve TikTok in the United States,” it said. “ByteDance will work in accordance with applicable laws to ensure TikTok remains available to American users through TikTok U.S.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">This leaves us in effectively the same place as we were earlier this week, when <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/778087/tiktok-ban-framework-deal-us-china-trump">the Trump administration announced</a> a “framework” agreement had been reached; not long after, it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/779161/trump-extends-the-tiktok-ban-enforcement-deadline-again">extended the January 2025 sale deadline</a> for the fourth time. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/778789/tiktok-us-china-deal-investors-oracle">Reporting on Tuesday indicated</a> that the deal could actually take 30 to 45 more days.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The expected buyers are a consortium that includes Oracle, Andreessen Horowitz, and Susquehanna International Group, with ByteDance reportedly retaining a share just shy of 20 percent, as mandated by a divest-or-ban law Congress passed in 2024. They’re expected to develop a version of the app with a new recommendation algorithm walled off from Chinese control.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">TikTok users, meanwhile, are still in the dark about the future of their app — hoping another trade war won’t <a href="https://www.theverge.com/command-line-newsletter/644038/trumps-tariffs-tiktok-deal-china-bytedance">throw a wrench</a> in the agreement, with no hard timeline for resolution in sight.</p>

It feels like we’ve reached total saturation when it comes to streaming services, but apparently people are happy to sign up for one (or two) more services if they include live sports. According to Antenna, a firm that tracks the streaming industry, the new ESPN service and Fox One signed up about a million new [&#8230;]

<p class="has-text-align-none">It feels like we’ve reached total saturation when it comes to streaming services, but apparently people are happy to sign up for one (or two) more services if they include <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/606492/disney-espn-sports-streaming-future-flagship-app">live sports</a>. According to <a href="https://www.antenna.live/insights/antennas-first-look-at-espn-and-fox-ones-direct-to-consumer-debut">Antenna</a>, a firm that tracks the streaming industry, the new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/719716/espn-live-sports-streaming-service-launch-date-price">ESPN</a> service and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/718928/fox-one-streaming-service-price-launch-date-availablity">Fox One</a> signed up about a million new subscribers in just 10 days. And that number doesn’t include those signing in through a cable subscription or coming over from an existing Disney+ sub.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Antenna didn’t specify how many people signed up for ESPN versus Fox One, though according to <a href="https://frontofficesports.com/inside-espns-industry-shaping-dtc-plan-whats-at-stake/">Front Office Sports</a>, most of the subscribers are for ESPN. With the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/664913/fox-sports-news-streaming-service-nfl-season-launch">NFL season</a> just getting underway it’s no surprise that many were eager to sign up for a service that would let them watch live football without cable. Fox One includes Fox News and Fox Business, but the real draw is livestreams from Fox Sports, FS1, FS2, and local Fox affiliates. These are, of course, just early results and it remains to be seen if both services will see continued success when the football season ends.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">While you can subscribe to ESPN’s new offering for $29.99 a month, or Fox One for $19.99 a month, bundles will continue to be a big part of Disney’s strategy. The company is even planning to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/757483/espn-fox-one-live-sports-streaming-service-bundle">offer the two</a> under a single sub for $39.99 starting October 2nd.&nbsp;</p>
