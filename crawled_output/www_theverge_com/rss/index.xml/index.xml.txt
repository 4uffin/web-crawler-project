<p class="has-text-align-none">Qualcomm has announced that its upcoming flagship mobile chipset is the “Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5,” a confusingly named successor to the Snapdragon 8 Elite. While the processor itself will be unveiled during the Snapdragon Summit on September 23rd-25th, Qualcomm has already published an explanation for the branding update.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“It might look like we skipped generations, but the truth is simpler— and more powerful. Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 marks the fifth generation of our premium 8-series platforms since we introduced our new single-digit naming and visual identity, ” <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/onq/2025/09/snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5-name-power-why">Qualcomm said in a blog</a> post. “So, while the naming may look new, it’s actually a continuation of our established framework.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">This move aims to make the generational Snapdragon mobile chip lineup easier for consumers to understand. After releasing the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, Gen 2, and Gen 3, Qualcomm broke its naming conventions with last year’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/21/24273802/qualcomm-8-elite-oryon-cpu-android-smartphone-soc">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>, which is technically the fourth generation of the Snapdragon 8-series. Reintroducing generation numbers will help to make it clearer that these products all exist within the same family and release timeline, while (perhaps not coincidentally) avoiding the number four — which is considered to be unlucky in Chinese culture.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">To Qualcomm’s credit, this is less confusing than the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/22/22796541/qualcomm-snapdragon-branding-naming-scheme-changes-updates">numerical branding</a> it previously used for its Snapdragon mobile chips, but it&#8217;s amusing that it still had to justify the switch to people who were expecting this to be called the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 2.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 is poised to rival Apple&#8217;s new A19 Pro chipset, and is expected to power the next generation of flagship Android phones, such as Samsung’s Galaxy S26 series and the <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/OnePlus-15-makes-Geekbench-debut-along-with-heavily-nerfed-Snapdragon-8-Elite-2.1099739.0.html">OnePlus 15</a>. </p>

Microsoft has started testing a change to how Xbox controllers operate on Windows 11. The change will allow Xbox controllers to easily access the Task View on Windows 11 to tab between apps and games, using the Xbox button. “A new change we’re introducing is when you long press the Xbox button, it will open [&#8230;]

<p class="has-text-align-none">The change will align Xbox controllers with the work Microsoft is doing for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682011/microsoft-windows-xbox-pc-combination-features-rog-xbox-ally-devices">handheld gaming PCs with Windows 11</a>. The upcoming Xbox Ally devices will have an Xbox button, which opens a handheld-friendly task switcher with a long press. Microsoft has tweaked the task switcher on handhelds so it has new animations, and it’s not clear if this same interface will come to all Windows 11 gaming PCs.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">You can already use a single press of the Xbox button on handhelds or controllers to open the Game Bar in Windows 11, and access widgets, games, and performance information. Microsoft has started testing this change with Windows Insiders in the Dev Channel, so they should be available to all Windows 11 users in the coming months.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Neil Poulton succeeded in elevating the design of external drives two decades ago with the introduction of LaCie’s Rugged line, which features a bright orange bumper to protect data from drops. Today, Seagate announced an updated version of the LaCie Rugged Mini SSD with a few small design tweaks and a big boost to transfer speeds.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The drive is now called the LaCie Rugged SSD4 and is available starting today in 1TB, 2TB, and 4TB capacities (Seagate is dropping the 500MB option) for $134.99, $249.99, and $479.99, respectively.</p>
<img src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/lacie2.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0.049999999999997,0,99.9,100" alt="The LacIe Rugged SSD4 external drive against a white background." title="The LacIe Rugged SSD4 external drive against a white background." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="&lt;em&gt;The new Rugged SSD4 introduces a few small design tweaks including a brushed aluminum finish.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Seagate" data-portal-copyright="Image: Seagate" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">The Rugged SSD4 is exactly the same size as its predecessor but now features a brushed aluminum finish and a centered USB-C port. It now supports transfer speeds up to 40Gbps with 4,000MB/s read speeds and 3,000MB/s write speeds. Seagate’s older Rugged Mini SSD had a USB-C port that was slightly off-center, a smoother aluminum finish, and read speeds that maxed out at 2,000MB/s.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The new drive isn’t quite as fast as the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24339973/thunderbolt-5-seagate-lacie-rugged-ssd-pro5-sabrent-owc">LaCie Rugged SSD Pro5</a> that was introduced earlier this year at CES with 6,700MB/s read and 5,300MB/s write speeds, but when it’s connected to a USB-C iPhone, the Rugged SSD4 is fast enough to capture ProRes 4K footage at 120fps.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">As with the <a href="https://www.seagate.com/products/creative-pro/lacie-rugged-mini-ssd/?sku=STMF500400">previous version</a>, the new Rugged SSD4 has an IP54 rating against dust and water, but it’s definitely not waterproof so while splashes are okay, a complete dunking would not be. Its orange bumper also protects it from drops as high as nearly 10 feet, but that’s definitely not an invitation to casually toss it around.</p>

Alongside its new iPhone 17 lineup, Apple casually launched a world’s first last week inside the very dull sounding “Apple 40W Dynamic Power Adapter with 60W Max.” It’s the first charger to support the USB PD 3.2 AVS protocol, giving you some of the benefits of a more powerful 60W charger in a compact 40W [&#8230;]

<p class="has-text-align-none">Alongside its new iPhone 17 lineup, Apple casually launched a world’s first last week inside the very dull sounding “<a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MGKN4AM/A/40w-dynamic-power-adapter-with-60w-max">Apple 40W Dynamic Power Adapter with 60W Max.</a>” It’s the first charger to support the USB PD 3.2 AVS protocol, giving you some of the benefits of a more powerful 60W charger in a compact 40W package.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">AVS — which stands for Adjustable Voltage Supply — provides granular voltage options allowing the power source to offer more precise and efficient charging of devices like smartphones and laptops. You can <a href="https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/65105-135925-Dynamic-Power-Supply-Options-xl.jpg" data-type="link" data-id="https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/65105-135925-Dynamic-Power-Supply-Options-xl.jpg">see it listed</a> on the charger specs from <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/09/14/hands-on-apples-new-60w-charger-is-all-but-needed-for-iphone-17-fast-charging" data-type="link" data-id="https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/09/14/hands-on-apples-new-60w-charger-is-all-but-needed-for-iphone-17-fast-charging"><em>Apple Insider’s</em> hands-on</a>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">For reasons of safety, efficiency, and longevity, the batteries in our phones and laptops do not charge at their maximum possible input for the entirety of the charging cycle. Instead it’s regulated at predefined voltages to slow down charging as the battery fills. With AVS, the power source can provide a very specific voltage that is closer to the ideal needed for the device being charged, speeding up charging without overheating.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">However, unlike a true 60W charger, Apple’s little 40W GaN charger can not maintain that peak 60W rate forever — only 18 minutes as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UsbCHardware/comments/1nfhctl/hands_on_review_apples_4060w_dynamic_power_adapter/">demonstrated by Privaterbok</a>&nbsp;over at the r/UsbCHardware subreddit. That makes it suitable for fast charging a new iPhone 17 but not a MacBook Pro, which is why Apple sells it as a 40W charger “with 60W Max” and not a 60W charger.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It also means that you might need Apple’s $39 Dynamic Power Adapter if you want to match Apple’s fast charging claim for the iPhone 17 models (“<a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/09/apple-debuts-iphone-17/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/09/apple-debuts-iphone-17/">up to 50 percent in 20 minutes</a>”) or wait for Anker and others to provide a compatible USB PD 3.2 AVS charger of their own.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Disclosure: Penske Media Corporation is an investor in Vox Media, The Verge’s parent company.</em></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Penske Media Corporation, the publisher of <em>Rolling Stone</em> and <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em>, has become the first major American media company to sue Google over its AI summaries. The company claims that the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/14/24155321/google-search-ai-results-page-gemini-overview">AI Overviews</a> that often appear at the top of search results leave users with little reason to click through to the source, hurting traffic and illegally benefitting from the work of its reporters. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">While Penske Media is the biggest name to take on Google over its AI Overviews, it’s not the first. Online education company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/619051/chegg-google-ai-overviews-monopoly">Chegg sued Google</a> in February, as did a group of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/698486/european-publishers-have-beef-with-googles-ai-overviews">independent publishers</a> in Europe. The News / Media Alliance has also spoken out about the feature, calling it the “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/672132/news-media-alliance-google-ai-mode-theft">definition of theft</a>” and seeking action from the DOJ.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Google spokesperson José Castañeda defended the summaries to the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/rolling-stone-publisher-sues-google-over-ai-summaries-3afde408"><em>Wall Street Journal</em></a> saying, “with AI Overviews, people find search more helpful and use it more.” But Penske and other publishers say there is little reason to follow the links provided in search results and, as a result, they have seen <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/google-ai-news-publishers-7e687141?mod=article_inline">significant drops in traffic and revenue</a>. Penske claims in the suit that revenue from affiliate links is down by over 1/3 this year, and it attributes that directly to a drop in traffic from Google.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The company also claims it’s in a tough situation. It can either block Google from indexing its content, essentially removing itself from all search results, which would further devastate its business. Or, it can continue to provide training material to Google for its AI, “adding fuel to a fire that threatens PMC’s [Penske Media Corporation] entire publishing business,” the complaint states, according to the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">This is, of course, just the latest battle between AI companies and the creators of the content they harvest. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/777344/perplexity-lawsuit-encyclopedia-britannica-merriam-webster">Encyclopedia Britannica and Merriam-Webster</a> recently sued Perplexity, as did <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/21/24275924/news-corp-wall-street-journal-perplexity-lawsuit-copyright-infringement">News Corp</a> last year. Meanwhile Microsoft and OpenAI have found themselves in the crosshairs of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/27/24016212/new-york-times-openai-microsoft-lawsuit-copyright-infringement">New York Times</a>, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/30/24145603/ai-openai-microsoft-new-york-daily-news-sue-copyright">New York Daily News, the Chicago Tribune</a>, and others. Google might also have a tougher time defending itself now that it’s been forced to admit that “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/773928/google-open-web-rapid-decline">the open web is already in rapid decline</a>,” as it faces multiple <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/650665/google-loses-ad-tech-antitrust-monopoly-lawsuit">antitrust</a><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23869483/us-v-google-search-antitrust-case-updates"> </a><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23869483/us-v-google-search-antitrust-case-updates">complaints</a>.</p>
