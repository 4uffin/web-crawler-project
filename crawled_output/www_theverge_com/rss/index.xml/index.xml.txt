Google is testing a new search app for Windows. A&#160;blog post on Tuesday said the app, currently available on personal accounts via Google’s Search Labs, will allow you to use an Alt + Space shortcut to search for information from the files on your computer, in your Drive, and on the web. The app, which [&#8230;]

<p class="has-text-align-none">Google is testing a new search app for Windows. <span>A<a href="https://blog.google/products/search/google-app-windows-labs/" target="_blank">&nbsp;blog post on Tuesday</a></span> said the app, currently available on personal accounts <a href="https://labs.google.com/search/experiment/40">via Google’s Search Labs</a>, will allow you to use an <strong>Alt </strong>+<strong> Space</strong> shortcut to search for information from the files on your computer, in your Drive, and on the web.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The app, which has a Chrome-like install process and requires you to sign in, also comes with Google’s visual search feature, Lens, built in. That means you can select and search for images on your screen, as well as translate text. In one example shared by Google, you can highlight a math problem on your homework and then ask Google’s AI Mode to help you find the answer.</p>
<img src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/74e848c3-95b7-4cf2-a04c-ec91bbd2ae17.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,2.2073714054273,100,95.585257189145" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="Image: Google" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Just like Google’s search engine on the web, you can switch between all results, AI Mode, Images, Shopping, and Videos, and more, as well as choose between dark and light mode. It’s similar to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/apple-mac-os/777936/apple-macos-tahoe-26-final-release-testing-impressions-liquid-glass">the Spotlight on Mac</a>, which can help you search through your files, apps, and the web. Windows has long had a built-in feature that lets you search through your files and the web, but it recently upgraded this capability with the launch of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/656106/microsoft-recall-copilot-plus-pc-available">Copilot Plus PCs</a>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Upon downloading the app, Google will plant a search bar directly on your desktop that you can drag anywhere on your screen and resize. You can minimize the search bar by hitting <strong>Alt </strong>+ <strong>Space</strong>. The app also gives you the option to enable or disable AI Mode, as well as change the shortcut used to open the app by selecting your profile picture and hitting <strong>Configurations</strong><em>.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You can try out Google’s new app for Windows now by <a href="https://labs.google.com/search/experiment/40">enabling the experiment in Labs</a>. It’s currently only available in English and for users in the US. You’ll need a PC with Windows 10 or up to download it.</p>

<div class="product-block"><h3>Apple Watch Solo Loop Band</h3>
<figure class="product-image"><img width="300" height="200" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/Apple-Watch-Solo-Loop-Band.png?w=300" class="attachment-medium size-medium" alt="" /></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The <strong>Solo Loop band</strong> is made from liquid silicon rubber that Apple says is sweat and swimproof, and has been treated with UV light to make its finish feel smooth. It’s available in several solid colors and hues to match your style. However, the Solo Loop is a single piece of material with no way to adjust its size, so you have to be sure it fits your wrist before you get one. Apple has a <a href="https://store.storeimages.cdn-apple.com/4982/store.apple.com/shop/Catalog/US/Images/bxxd/size-guide_US.pdf">printable sizing tool</a> to help you figure out which size is right for your wrists. You’ll also have to choose a watch band that’s appropriate for the size of your Apple Watch, and can use Apple’s <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/108056">identification tool</a> if you don’t know that information off the top of your head.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The <strong>Solo Braided Loop</strong> is an official Apple Watch band made from recycled polyester yarn filaments weaved around silicon threads. Apple says the material is textured and soft while being both sweat and water resistant. As with the Solo Loop, the Braided Solo Loop has some give but its length can’t be adjusted, so you’ll need to get one in the correct size. Most of these bands are available in a single color, but Woot has discounted the <a href="https://electronics.woot.com/offers/apple-watch-braided-solo-loop-pride-edition-2021z-4?ref=w_cnt_wp_0_11">multicolor Pride Edition band</a> Apple released in 2021.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">TikTok might not finalize its deal to sell its US operations for at least another month. Sources <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/16/tiktok-bytedance-oracle-china.html">tell CNBC’s David Faber</a> that the US and China might close on an agreement within the next 30 to 45 days, while Oracle will remain the app’s cloud partner, allowing it to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/631999/oracle-tiktok-ban-deal-project-texas">continue routing US user data</a> on American servers.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">On Monday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters that the US and China <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/778087/tiktok-ban-framework-deal-us-china-trump">have reached a “framework deal”</a> for TikTok. He added that President Donald Trump would confirm the deal on Friday — two days after TikTok’s latest deadline to divest expires. Trump has already given TikTok <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/688252/tiktok-ban-trump-extension-deal">three extensions to negotiate a deal</a>, and it’s unclear whether he’ll grant TikTok another while the company finalizes an agreement.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">TikTok’s future in the US became shrouded in uncertainty after the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/24/24139036/biden-signs-tiktok-ban-bill-divest-foreign-aid-package">federal government passed</a> the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, which mandates that TikTok must divest from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, or face a ban in the US due to national security concerns.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">On Tuesday, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/china-agrees-tiktok-deal-u-s-includes-algorithm-licensing?utm_campaign=%5BREBRAND%5D+%5BTI-AM%5D+Th&amp;utm_content=1095&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=cio&amp;utm_term=124"><em>The Information</em> reported</a> that the US and China have reached an agreement on the “licensing of TikTok’s algorithms and other intellectual property rights.” Previous reports suggested that TikTok <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/698999/tiktok-ban-sale-rumor-new-app-oracle">could launch a separate version</a> of its app for US users. As noted by CNBC, a group of investment firms, including some existing ByteDance shareholders, could gain control of TikTok’s US operations. Trump confirmed on Tuesday that “we have a group of very big companies that want to buy it,” <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/trump-says-us-has-buyer-tiktok-2025-09-16/?utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=Newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=Technology-Roundup&amp;utm_term=091625&amp;lctg=6353df1e553fd5d4e20f4946">according to <em>Reuters</em></a>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“’I’m hearing it’s [the deal] actually going to be relatively small in terms of the actual size of the checks that are written for the entity itself, and it will not be something that is going to go public at some point,” Faber said during CNBC’s <em>Squawk on the Street</em>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Influencers and content creators are many things beyond their public personas. All but the biggest figures likely do some combination of the following jobs themselves: content moderator, video editor, photographer, social media strategist, script writer, and idea generator. What if they could outsource much of that work to AI? And what if it were the social media platforms themselves that provided them with the tools to do so?&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">At the Made on YouTube event, held Tuesday in New York, the company <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-studio-made-on-youtube-2025/">launched a slew of new AI features aimed at content creators</a>, many of which focus on all the behind-the-scenes work that goes into a video. Unlike previous tools — like an <a href="http://theverge.com/news/647422/youtube-ai-music-assistant-generator-background">AI background music generator</a> or tools that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/21/23883749/youtube-generative-ai-dream-screen-creators">create AI photos and videos</a> — the new ones are largely content strategy features, marketed as helping creators reach new audiences (and more effectively get in front of their existing base).</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Among the new tools is Ask Studio, an AI chatbot that creators can use to ask analytics questions about how their content is performing. Amjad Hanif, VP of product management, describes it as a “creative partner”: How is the audience responding to a video? What are the most compelling moments of a video? The tool pulls in data from across a YouTube channel, including long-form videos and Shorts — essentially a faster and more direct analytics tool that’s built into the platform. Creators can ask the tool to do things like summarize comments and synthesize viewer sentiment, and ask for suggestions based on data: if YouTube reports a drop off in viewership at a certain part, Ask Studio will spit out advice for next time on optimizing that section of the video. Creators can also ask for things like “video ideas from comments on my latest video,” and follow up with requests for title suggestions. For now, the tool can’t compare one channel versus another (queries like “What videos from my competitors are performing well?”).</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Also rolling out is a new thumbnail and title A/B testing feature, building upon a thumbnail testing version <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/11/24176325/youtube-thumbnails-test-compare-a-b">announced last year</a>. With this update, creators can pair thumbnail images and titles and run tests to see which performs the best; the “winner” is the combination with the highest watch time.</p>
<img src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/image-4-5.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=6.4485081809432,0,87.102983638114,100" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="Image: YouTube" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">“No matter how good the video is, the thumbnail and title is what gets people to even see the video and see if it&#8217;s good or not. It might be the most important thing, honestly,” says Ashley Alexander, a lifestyle influencer who was given early access and who has been testing some of the tools. Alexander says she uses the thumbnail-only testing feature for every video and has begun integrating the new thumbnail and title A/B testing tool into her workflow.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The influx of tools essentially meant to help creators optimize for the YouTube algorithm is something of a paradigm shift. For years, creators ran their own tests to figure out what worked best for each social media platform: how to write the most enticing title or whether to have <a href="https://x.com/MrBeast/status/1699459457002918138?lang=en">a closed or open mouth in a thumbnail</a>. It was trial and error, with creators trying to sort through what kind of content the platforms preferred. Now, some platforms themselves directly tell creators <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/1/24259462/instagram-best-practices-business-profiles-tips-reach">what they should post</a> and how — TikTok tells creators what topics are trending and even what their followers are searching for in the app, with explicit nudges that creators should make videos that target those searches. The effect is twofold: It’s a way for YouTube and other platforms to more directly guide what creators make. “Optimizing” content is also potentially beneficial to both creators and YouTube itself — both parties want viewers to be spending more time on the platform, watching their videos. </p>
<img src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/image-3-6.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=1.25,0,97.5,100" alt="YouTube’s Ask Studio analytics chatbot" title="YouTube’s Ask Studio analytics chatbot" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="Image: YouTube" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">YouTube is also expanding some viewer-facing AI tools, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/654039/youtube-expands-its-auto-dubbing-feature-again">like dubbing</a>. Previously, creators had access to an auto-dubbing feature — now, the feature will also sync the YouTuber’s lips to match the dubbed language. Content that uses YouTube’s AI dubbing feature will have a badge underneath the title and in the video description indicating it was auto-dubbed. Creators won’t be able to go through and correct or tweak mistranslated portions after uploading. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Separately, creators will also have the option to add multiple collaborators to a single video — essentially a cross-posting feature. Each collaborator will be able to see performance metrics for the video.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The AI creep into influencing and content creation has been happening for a while, and across industries: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/692286/ai-bots-llm-onlyfans">adult content creators are using chatbots</a> to interact with paying clients and platforms are encouraging advertisers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/684572/tiktok-ai-advertising-videos-try-on-product-placement">to use AI-generated models</a> to sell products. When YouTube recently updated its monetization rules, many creators <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/703772/youtube-monetization-policy-update-ai-spam">understood</a> the “inauthentic content” policy was taking aim at AI-generated mass produced videos. Some creators were concerned about what exactly qualified as &#8220;inauthentic,&#8221; how YouTube would screen content, and how it would decide what to demonetize.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/26/24186635/baggu-collina-strada-collaboration-ai-purses-art">example</a> after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/9/23752354/ai-spfbo-cover-art-contest-midjourney-clarkesworld">example</a> of online and hobby communities <a href="https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/691355/ai-is-ruining-houseplant-communities-online">reckoning</a> with an influx of AI content — but does it matter if it’s happening behind the scenes? Do viewers care if their favorite YouTuber uses AI to come up with video topic ideas, like the platform encourages them to do? And if everyone is perfectly optimized for YouTube’s algorithm and relying on the same built-in tools, is anyone <em>really </em>optimized? Who wins when everyone’s thumbnail and title are just right, or when everyone is using the same AI tool to generate the perfect video topics and scripts?</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Creators like Alexander say the features are a jumping-off point, not a cheat code: the AI-generated ideas are a good place to start, but she thinks ultimately she knows her audience best. For many content creators, their audiences buy into them as people making distinct creative choices, not just churning out whatever a chatbot suggests — that relationship is something AI can’t replicate.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">YouTube is introducing some live streaming features that give content creators new ways to grow their audiences and interact with viewers. The updates were announced at the Made on YouTube event today, and include simultaneous horizontal and vertical streams, AI-powered livestream highlights, and the ability to livestream reactions to other live YouTube content on mobile devices.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">YouTube says that the new features announced today are “part of the largest upgrade to Live we’ve ever made.” The updates aim to attract more users to the platform&#8217;s livestreamed content, with the service reporting that more than 30 percent of daily logged-in viewers had watched live content in YouTube’s second quarter this year.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The first feature allows creators to stream both horizontally and vertically at the same time, giving viewers across both mobile and desktop formats a more optimized experience. This is combined with a single unified chat room that enables viewers to interact with each other, regardless of the format they’re watching. This is currently in the testing stages, according to YouTube, and is expected to expand to more creators “in the coming months.”</p>
<img src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/Stream-Across-Formats-product-mock.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100" alt="An example of the simultaneous horizontal and vertical streams in Creator Studio." title="An example of the simultaneous horizontal and vertical streams in Creator Studio." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="&lt;em&gt;Creators will be able to see both stream formats in Creator Studio to track framing.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: YouTube" data-portal-copyright="Image: YouTube" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Creators will also be able to react in real-time to eligible livestreams on YouTube. The feature allows streamers to go live on mobile alongside content like live events and keynote announcements, building on the popularity of reaction streams on YouTube and Twitch, but with fewer concerns around licensing and copyright restrictions. YouTube says it will start testing live content reactions “early next year before we expand further.”</p>
<img src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/YouTube-livestream-reactions.gif?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100" alt="A GIF demonstrating YouTube’s upcoming live reactions feature." title="A GIF demonstrating YouTube’s upcoming live reactions feature." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="&lt;em&gt;Watch this space to see your favorite tech and gaming YouTuber’s streaming live reactions to event keynotes.&lt;/em&gt; | GIF: YouTube" data-portal-copyright="GIF: YouTube" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">YouTube is giving creators on mobile devices AI-powered livestream highlights that automatically turn stream clips into Shorts “in the next few weeks,” and the ability to practice streaming on the mobile app until they’re ready to launch a real livestream sometime later this year. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/28/24166363/youtube-games-playables-youtube-premium">“Playables” games</a> that YouTube launched last year will also soon allow streamers to play while interacting with their viewers in vertical livestreams. This is rolling out to some creators next month, before expanding later this year.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Some of the updates specifically focus on helping creators to monetize their content. A feature is currently rolling out to creators with channel memberships that allows them to transition between public and members-only livestreams, for example, encouraging viewers to become paying channel members to avoid missing out. Ads displayed to the side of YouTube livestreams that already appear on desktop and TV will also be expanding to mobile devices later this year.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“Grounded in community feedback, these features are designed to help creators get discovered, grow their channel, and increase their earnings,” Aaron Filner, YouTube’s senior director of product management, said in a blog post. It&#8217;s good to see YouTube showing its livestream content creators some love after its persistent fixation on Shorts, but we’ll have to see if these updates could help the platform compete with livestream-focused services like Twitch.</p>

All five models feature built-in speakers developed as part of a partnership with Bose, Epson’s new 3LCD projection technology, Google TV, and a new mobile app for iOS and Android that can be used to create movies and photo slideshows that stream to the projectors.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The most expensive model in the new lineup is the <a href="https://epson.com/For-Home/Projectors/Home-Cinema/Epson-Lifestudio-Grand-4K-PRO-UHD-Ultra-Short-Throw-Laser-Projector-%E2%80%94-White/p/V11HB82020" data-type="link" data-id="https://epson.com/For-Home/Projectors/Home-Cinema/Epson-Lifestudio-Grand-4K-PRO-UHD-Ultra-Short-Throw-Laser-Projector-%E2%80%94-White/p/V11HB82020">$2,699.99 Epson Lifestudio Grand</a>: an ultra-short throw projector that can create a 4K, 120-inch image when positioned just 15.2-inches away from a wall or screen. Weighing over 16 pounds it’s not designed with portability in mind, but with 3,600 lumens of output, it’s Epson’s brightest Lifestudio projector — and the loudest, with a pair of 45mm speakers and an 80mm subwoofer.</p>
<img src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/epson_flex.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0.024473813020066,100,99.95105237396" alt="The Epson Lifestudio Flex Plus projector on a display stand." title="The Epson Lifestudio Flex Plus projector on a display stand." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="&lt;em&gt;The Flex Plus projector can be powered over a USB-C connection to a battery, improving its portability.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Epson" data-portal-copyright="Image: Epson" />

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Flex Plus is a 4K model with 1,000 lumens of illumination and ambient lighting so it can double as a (very expensive) lamp. It can be powered through a USB-C port using an adapter or a battery with at least 100W of output. If you go the battery route to improve its portability, Epson says a 24,000mAh power bank will provide up to 70 minutes of movie watching. The more affordable Lifestudio Flex is limited to 1080P and 700 lumens of brightness, but can’t be powered over USB-C.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Aurzen has announced a new portable projector that will be the first to run the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/lowpass-newsletter/776248/roku-ai-ads">Roku TV</a> OS already found on TVs from brands like TCL and Hisense. The new Aurzen D1R Cube will have access to popular streaming apps like Netflix, Disney Plus, and Amazon Prime, plus <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395533/roku-originals-quibi-content-tv">Roku Originals</a> and over <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23680217/fast-services-tubi-roku-pluto-tv">500 FAST live channels</a>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The D1R Cube is available starting today for $169.99 through <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FDGLZKKM?th=1">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://aurzen.com/">Aurzen’s online store</a> in gray, white, and green color options. Alongside the $299 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/621360/aurzen-zip-projector-review-tri-fold-specs-price">tri-fold Zip</a>, the Cube will be one of Aurzen’s most aggressively priced projectors. But its limited capabilities will potentially make it better suited as a portable solution for bringing movie night along on your next camping trip instead of the centerpiece of your home theater setup.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Aurzen says the Cube is capable of projecting an image up to 150 inches in size. With just 330 ANSI lumens of brightness, though, you’ll want a reflective screen and a completely dark room to avoid an image that’s dim or washed-out. For comparison, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/765735/anker-nebula-x1-pro-party-speaker-price-specs">Soundcore Nebula X1 Pro projector</a> that Anker announced at IFA 2025 boasts 3,500 ANSI lumens of brightness. And while the Cube does support 4K content, it only displays it at 1080p.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite its budget-minded pricing, the D1R Cube includes features like automatic focus and keystone adjustments for easier setup, 5W built-in speakers located on either side, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth for connecting the projector to louder wireless speakers or headphones. It also supports Apple AirPlay so you can stream video and audio directly from your iPhone and iPad. You can use Roku’s mobile app as a remote control with voice commands, and Roku Smart Home lets you get notifications from other smart devices around your home, including access to live feeds from security cameras.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The majority of the all-in-one projectors available today, including models from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/685361/xgimi-mogo-series-4-projectors-laser">Xgimi</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/707436/nebula-x1-review-best-portable-projector-price-specs">Anker</a>, feature Google TV. Although that OS provides access to a larger variety of apps (including games) when compared to Roku TV, many entry-level projectors running Google TV have not been certified to natively access Netflix, requiring additional hardware like a dongle to use one of the most popular streaming apps. Roku TV provides not only that app but access to a lot of subscription-free content, including FAST channels and the library from the defunct streaming platform Quibi, which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220426/quibi-roku-channel-acquisition-content">Roku acquired in early 2021</a>.</p>

AT&#38;T is testing an AI-powered assistant designed to screen phone calls for you. The mobile carrier is bringing the feature to a select group of customers this year, and likens it to a “digital receptionist” that can identify and filter out robocallers based on the information from its network, like your call history. “This is [&#8230;]

<p class="has-text-align-none">AT&amp;T is testing <a href="https://about.att.com/blogs/2025/ai-digital-receptionist.html">an AI-powered assistant</a> designed to screen phone calls for you. The mobile carrier is bringing the feature to a select group of customers this year, and likens it to a “digital receptionist” that can identify and filter out robocallers based on the information from its network, like your call history.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“This is only the foundation of what it can do,” Andy Markus, AT&amp;T’s chief data officer, tells <em>The Verge</em>, adding that the AI assistant could eventually help you make reservations or schedule appointments in the future, similar to what you can do <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/603501/google-ask-for-me-search-labs">with Google’s AI assistant</a>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">When you receive a call from an unknown number, AT&amp;T’s AI assistant will pick up and ask for more information about who’s calling and why. The AI assistant will patch the call through to you if it meets certain criteria, such as whether it determines the caller is human based on the sound of its voice or if it detects a sense of urgency. Otherwise, it can take a message or hang up.</p>
<img src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/agentic-ai-receptionist.gif?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="GIF: AT&amp;T" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">AT&amp;T will use the information from its network to determine whether a caller is someone you interact with frequently, but you’ll also be able to put numbers on a “Do Not Screen” list, allowing calls from lesser-used numbers, like your doctor’s office or your child’s school, to go directly to you.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Markus says that building the AI agent directly into the carrier’s network is what helps make it stand out from other call-screening features, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24323787/android-google-samsung-phone-calls-how-to">those launched by Google</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/777466/apple-ios-26-launch-iphone-liquid-glass-update">Apple</a>. “Using the network, it understands the pattern that you as a consumer have,” Markus says. “Based on what we understand through the network, if my brother calls, we see that I interact with my brother all the time. Of course, that call should go through.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Google’s Call Screen feature, on the other hand, <a href="https://support.google.com/phoneapp/answer/9094888?sjid=785130417043028723-NA">uses your phone’s contact list</a> to determine if you know an incoming caller. It also detects spam based on what the caller says, as well as by comparing numbers against its database of known spammers and robocallers.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But AT&amp;T’s on-network assistant doesn’t need a specific device to use the feature. AT&amp;T will also let you see the AI assistant’s transcript in real time from its app, allowing you to keep tabs on the conversation while it happens. You can pick up the call at any time, or let the AI assistant handle it and provide an AI-generated summary of what it gathered.</p>
