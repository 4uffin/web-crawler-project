Waymo is now permitted to test its robotaxi service at San Francisco International Airport (SFO), a big win for the company as it seeks to expand its service area and tackle more popular, revenue-generating destinations. After years of back-and-forth negotiations, Waymo signed “Testing and Operations Pilot Permit” with SFO, San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie said [&#8230;]

<p class="has-text-align-none">Waymo is now permitted to test its robotaxi service at San Francisco International Airport (SFO), a big win for the company as it seeks to expand its service area and tackle more popular, revenue-generating destinations. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">After years of back-and-forth negotiations, Waymo signed “Testing and Operations Pilot Permit” with SFO, <a href="https://www.sf.gov/news-mayor-lurie-takes-key-step-toward-launching-waymo-at-sfo">San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie said in a release</a>. Under the agreement, Waymo will roll out its service to SFO in three phases, including testing vehicles with a human driver, testing without a driver, and eventually beginning commercial service. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Waymo will start its tests with employees before eventually inviting members of the public to take trips to and from the airport. Pickups and dropoffs will initially take place at SFO’s Kiss &amp; Fly lot, which is accessible to the terminals via the AirTrain. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Waymo operates in five cities, but currently only serves one airport: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/27/24229789/robots-go-to-the-airport">Phoenix’s Sky Harbor</a>. The company has been locked in negotiations with SFO for several years as it seeks to assure regulators that its vehicles can handle their chaotic environments, with thousands of cars, taxis, shuttles, and passengers constantly intermixing everyday. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But airports represent a huge money-making opportunity for robotaxis, with airport trips accounting for an estimated 20 percent of human-driven ridehail car trips. Waymo will need airport access if it hopes to eventually compete with Uber and Lyft — to say nothing of earning enough money to make a profit. </p>

Wyze has announced its first smart door lock that can be opened by simply hovering your open hand over it. The Wyze Palm Lock is launching today for $129.98 making it more affordable than similar palm-scanning smart locks including the $359.99 Philips Smart Deadbolt that launched last year. But your palm isn’t the only way [&#8230;]

<p class="has-text-align-none">Wyze has <a href="https://www.wyze.com/products/wyze-palm-lock">announced its first smart door lock</a> that can be opened by simply hovering your open hand over it. The Wyze Palm Lock is launching today for $129.98 making it more affordable than similar palm-scanning smart locks including the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/8/24025616/philips-door-lock-palm-recognition-smart-deadbolt-ces">$359.99 Philips Smart Deadbolt</a> that launched last year. But your palm isn’t the only way to unlock it. If it’s the dead of winter and you’re wearing gloves the Palm Lock can also be opened using a physical key, by punching in a code, or using Wyze’s mobile app.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s not as cheap as Wyze’s $80 Wyze Lock Bolt that we called the “Best budget smart(ish) lock” in our <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23393163/best-smart-door-lock">buying guide</a>, but the Palm Lock includes more functionality. Battery life is rated at up to six months thanks to the use of low-power millimeter wave radar that only wakes the lock when a person is detected nearby. Its primary battery can be removed so you can recharge it indoors, while a smaller secondary battery will keep the lock powered for up to two weeks. Should both batteries die, an external power source can be temporarily connected to a USB-C port allowing it to be unlocked using an access code.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Palm vein recognition has been <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214785320366256">shown to be a more secure and accurate</a> method of biometric security than fingerprint readers, and simply waving your hand over an infrared sensor requires less precision than scanning a fingerprint. The Wyze Palm Lock can store palm vein IDs for up to 50 users, and generate up to 50 unique entry codes giving access to people whose palms haven’t been registered.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Wyze’s Palm Lock is Wi-Fi connected so it can also be locked and unlocked from anywhere your phone has internet access or using voice commands through smart assistants like Amazon’s Alexa or Google Assistant. For added security, the lock incorporates a gyroscope that detects the door’s angle and movements. It can be set to automatically lock the door when it senses it’s been closed all the way, or start audibly chirping after a set period of time if it detects the door has been left open.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tesla is under investigation for faulty electronic door handles that can trap people inside their vehicles. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) <a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2025/INOA-PE25010-18817.pdf">launched the probe</a>, saying it was responding to numerous complaints filed by Tesla owners, with a particular focus on children who have been locked inside the vehicle without any way to get out. The news comes a few days after <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2025-tesla-dangerous-doors/"><em>Bloomberg</em> published a bombshell report</a> about Tesla owners who have been seriously injured after becoming trapped in their vehicles after crashes. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Tesla’s door handles, which operate electronically and sit flush against the vehicle for improved aerodynamics, have been the source of some consternation for some time. China’s government is considering banning electronic door handles for safety reasons. And now NHTSA says it is investigating instances in which Tesla’s handles become inoperable as a result of low-voltage battery problems. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The investigation specifically focuses on an estimated 174,290 Model Y SUVs, though the regulator said the investigation could widen:</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none">This investigation will also assess the approach used by Tesla to supply power to the door locks and the reliability of the applicable power supplies. At this time, NHTSA’s investigation is focused on the operability of the electronic door locks from outside of the vehicle as that circumstance is the only one in which<br>there is no manual way to open the door. The agency will continue to monitor any reports of entrapment involving opening doors from inside of the vehicle, and [Office of Defects Investigation] will take further action as needed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="has-text-align-none">NHTSA says its investigation was prompted by nine instances of children becoming trapped inside a Tesla vehicle as a result of low-voltage battery problems. Typically, parents were unable to reopen their Tesla’s doors to retrieve their children from the backseat. Tesla’s vehicles contain manual door releases, but the agency notes that certain people, especially children, may not be able to operate them. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“Entrapment in a vehicle is particularly concerning in emergency situations, such as when children are entrapped in a hot vehicle,” the agency states.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">This is the latest investigation to target Tesla. The company is also being examined for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tesla/763603/tesla-autopilot-fsd-crash-report-delay-nhtsa">failing to report crashes</a> involving its partially autonomous driving technology in a timely manner, and for its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338250/tesla-actually-smart-summon-remote-parking-nhtsa">remote parking feature</a> after several crash incidents were reported.</p>

Google is testing a new search app for Windows.

<p class="has-text-align-none">Google is testing a new search app for Windows. <span>A<a href="https://blog.google/products/search/google-app-windows-labs/" target="_blank">&nbsp;blog post on Tuesday</a></span> said the app, currently available on personal accounts <a href="https://labs.google.com/search/experiment/40">via Google’s Search Labs</a>, will allow you to use an <strong>Alt </strong>+<strong> Space</strong> shortcut to search for information from the files on your computer, in your Drive, and on the web.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The app, which has a Chrome-like install process and requires you to sign in, also comes with Google’s visual search feature, Lens, built in. That means you can select and search for images on your screen, as well as translate text. In one example shared by Google, you can highlight a math problem on your homework and then ask Google’s AI Mode to help you find the answer.</p>
<img src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/74e848c3-95b7-4cf2-a04c-ec91bbd2ae17.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,2.2073714054273,100,95.585257189145" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="Image: Google" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Just like Google’s search engine on the web, you can switch between all results, AI Mode, Images, Shopping, and Videos, and more, as well as choose between dark and light mode. It’s similar to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/apple-mac-os/777936/apple-macos-tahoe-26-final-release-testing-impressions-liquid-glass">the Spotlight on Mac</a>, which can help you search through your files, apps, and the web. Windows has long had a built-in feature that lets you search through your files and the web, but it recently upgraded this capability with the launch of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/656106/microsoft-recall-copilot-plus-pc-available">Copilot Plus PCs</a>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Upon downloading the app, Google will plant a search bar directly on your desktop that you can drag anywhere on your screen and resize. You can minimize the search bar by hitting <strong>Alt </strong>+ <strong>Space</strong>. The app also gives you the option to enable or disable AI Mode, as well as change the shortcut used to open the app by selecting your profile picture and hitting <strong>Configurations</strong><em>.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You can try out Google’s new app for Windows now by <a href="https://labs.google.com/search/experiment/40">enabling the experiment in Labs</a>. It’s currently only available in English and for users in the US. You’ll need a PC with Windows 10 or up to download it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The <strong>Solo Loop band</strong> is made from liquid silicon rubber that Apple says is sweat and swimproof, and has been treated with UV light to make its finish feel smooth. It’s available in several solid colors and hues to match your style. However, the Solo Loop is a single piece of material with no way to adjust its size, so you have to be sure it fits your wrist before you get one. Apple has a <a href="https://store.storeimages.cdn-apple.com/4982/store.apple.com/shop/Catalog/US/Images/bxxd/size-guide_US.pdf">printable sizing tool</a> to help you figure out which size is right for your wrists. You’ll also have to choose a watch band that’s appropriate for the size of your Apple Watch, and can use Apple’s <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/108056">identification tool</a> if you don’t know that information off the top of your head.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The <strong>Solo Braided Loop</strong> is an official Apple Watch band made from recycled polyester yarn filaments weaved around silicon threads. Apple says the material is textured and soft while being both sweat and water resistant. As with the Solo Loop, the Braided Solo Loop has some give but its length can’t be adjusted, so you’ll need to get one in the correct size. Most of these bands are available in a single color, but Woot has discounted the <a href="https://electronics.woot.com/offers/apple-watch-braided-solo-loop-pride-edition-2021z-4?ref=w_cnt_wp_0_11">multicolor Pride Edition band</a> Apple released in 2021.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">TikTok might not finalize its deal to sell its US operations for at least another month. Sources <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/16/tiktok-bytedance-oracle-china.html">tell CNBC’s David Faber</a> that the US and China might close on an agreement within the next 30 to 45 days, while Oracle will remain the app’s cloud partner, allowing it to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/631999/oracle-tiktok-ban-deal-project-texas">continue routing US user data</a> on American servers.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">On Monday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters that the US and China <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/778087/tiktok-ban-framework-deal-us-china-trump">have reached a “framework deal”</a> for TikTok. He added that President Donald Trump would confirm the deal on Friday — two days after TikTok’s latest deadline to divest expires. Trump has already given TikTok <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/688252/tiktok-ban-trump-extension-deal">three extensions to negotiate a deal</a>, and it’s unclear whether he’ll grant TikTok another while the company finalizes an agreement.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">TikTok’s future in the US became shrouded in uncertainty after the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/24/24139036/biden-signs-tiktok-ban-bill-divest-foreign-aid-package">federal government passed</a> the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, which mandates that TikTok must divest from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, or face a ban in the US due to national security concerns.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">On Tuesday, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/china-agrees-tiktok-deal-u-s-includes-algorithm-licensing?utm_campaign=%5BREBRAND%5D+%5BTI-AM%5D+Th&amp;utm_content=1095&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=cio&amp;utm_term=124"><em>The Information</em> reported</a> that the US and China have reached an agreement on the “licensing of TikTok’s algorithms and other intellectual property rights.” Previous reports suggested that TikTok <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/698999/tiktok-ban-sale-rumor-new-app-oracle">could launch a separate version</a> of its app for US users. As noted by CNBC, a group of investment firms, including some existing ByteDance shareholders, could gain control of TikTok’s US operations. Trump confirmed on Tuesday that “we have a group of very big companies that want to buy it,” <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/trump-says-us-has-buyer-tiktok-2025-09-16/?utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=Newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=Technology-Roundup&amp;utm_term=091625&amp;lctg=6353df1e553fd5d4e20f4946">according to <em>Reuters</em></a>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“’I’m hearing it’s [the deal] actually going to be relatively small in terms of the actual size of the checks that are written for the entity itself, and it will not be something that is going to go public at some point,” Faber said during CNBC’s <em>Squawk on the Street</em>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Influencers and content creators are many things beyond their public personas. All but the biggest figures likely do some combination of the following jobs themselves: content moderator, video editor, photographer, social media strategist, script writer, and idea generator. What if they could outsource much of that work to AI? And what if it were the social media platforms themselves that provided them with the tools to do so?&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">At the Made on YouTube event, held Tuesday in New York, the company <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-studio-made-on-youtube-2025/">launched a slew of new AI features aimed at content creators</a>, many of which focus on all the behind-the-scenes work that goes into a video. Unlike previous tools — like an <a href="http://theverge.com/news/647422/youtube-ai-music-assistant-generator-background">AI background music generator</a> or tools that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/21/23883749/youtube-generative-ai-dream-screen-creators">create AI photos and videos</a> — the new ones are largely content strategy features, marketed as helping creators reach new audiences (and more effectively get in front of their existing base).</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Among the new tools is Ask Studio, an AI chatbot that creators can use to ask analytics questions about how their content is performing. Amjad Hanif, VP of product management, describes it as a “creative partner”: How is the audience responding to a video? What are the most compelling moments of a video? The tool pulls in data from across a YouTube channel, including long-form videos and Shorts — essentially a faster and more direct analytics tool that’s built into the platform. Creators can ask the tool to do things like summarize comments and synthesize viewer sentiment, and ask for suggestions based on data: if YouTube reports a drop off in viewership at a certain part, Ask Studio will spit out advice for next time on optimizing that section of the video. Creators can also ask for things like “video ideas from comments on my latest video,” and follow up with requests for title suggestions. For now, the tool can’t compare one channel versus another (queries like “What videos from my competitors are performing well?”).</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Also rolling out is a new thumbnail and title A/B testing feature, building upon a thumbnail testing version <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/11/24176325/youtube-thumbnails-test-compare-a-b">announced last year</a>. With this update, creators can pair thumbnail images and titles and run tests to see which performs the best; the “winner” is the combination with the highest watch time.</p>
<img src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/image-4-5.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=6.4485081809432,0,87.102983638114,100" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="Image: YouTube" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">“No matter how good the video is, the thumbnail and title is what gets people to even see the video and see if it&#8217;s good or not. It might be the most important thing, honestly,” says Ashley Alexander, a lifestyle influencer who was given early access and who has been testing some of the tools. Alexander says she uses the thumbnail-only testing feature for every video and has begun integrating the new thumbnail and title A/B testing tool into her workflow.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The influx of tools essentially meant to help creators optimize for the YouTube algorithm is something of a paradigm shift. For years, creators ran their own tests to figure out what worked best for each social media platform: how to write the most enticing title or whether to have <a href="https://x.com/MrBeast/status/1699459457002918138?lang=en">a closed or open mouth in a thumbnail</a>. It was trial and error, with creators trying to sort through what kind of content the platforms preferred. Now, some platforms themselves directly tell creators <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/1/24259462/instagram-best-practices-business-profiles-tips-reach">what they should post</a> and how — TikTok tells creators what topics are trending and even what their followers are searching for in the app, with explicit nudges that creators should make videos that target those searches. The effect is twofold: It’s a way for YouTube and other platforms to more directly guide what creators make. “Optimizing” content is also potentially beneficial to both creators and YouTube itself — both parties want viewers to be spending more time on the platform, watching their videos. </p>
<img src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/image-3-6.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=1.25,0,97.5,100" alt="YouTube’s Ask Studio analytics chatbot" title="YouTube’s Ask Studio analytics chatbot" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="Image: YouTube" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">YouTube is also expanding some viewer-facing AI tools, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/654039/youtube-expands-its-auto-dubbing-feature-again">like dubbing</a>. Previously, creators had access to an auto-dubbing feature — now, the feature will also sync the YouTuber’s lips to match the dubbed language. Content that uses YouTube’s AI dubbing feature will have a badge underneath the title and in the video description indicating it was auto-dubbed. Creators won’t be able to go through and correct or tweak mistranslated portions after uploading. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Separately, creators will also have the option to add multiple collaborators to a single video — essentially a cross-posting feature. Each collaborator will be able to see performance metrics for the video.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The AI creep into influencing and content creation has been happening for a while, and across industries: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/692286/ai-bots-llm-onlyfans">adult content creators are using chatbots</a> to interact with paying clients and platforms are encouraging advertisers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/684572/tiktok-ai-advertising-videos-try-on-product-placement">to use AI-generated models</a> to sell products. When YouTube recently updated its monetization rules, many creators <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/703772/youtube-monetization-policy-update-ai-spam">understood</a> the “inauthentic content” policy was taking aim at AI-generated mass produced videos. Some creators were concerned about what exactly qualified as &#8220;inauthentic,&#8221; how YouTube would screen content, and how it would decide what to demonetize.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/26/24186635/baggu-collina-strada-collaboration-ai-purses-art">example</a> after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/9/23752354/ai-spfbo-cover-art-contest-midjourney-clarkesworld">example</a> of online and hobby communities <a href="https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/691355/ai-is-ruining-houseplant-communities-online">reckoning</a> with an influx of AI content — but does it matter if it’s happening behind the scenes? Do viewers care if their favorite YouTuber uses AI to come up with video topic ideas, like the platform encourages them to do? And if everyone is perfectly optimized for YouTube’s algorithm and relying on the same built-in tools, is anyone <em>really </em>optimized? Who wins when everyone’s thumbnail and title are just right, or when everyone is using the same AI tool to generate the perfect video topics and scripts?</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Creators like Alexander say the features are a jumping-off point, not a cheat code: the AI-generated ideas are a good place to start, but she thinks ultimately she knows her audience best. For many content creators, their audiences buy into them as people making distinct creative choices, not just churning out whatever a chatbot suggests — that relationship is something AI can’t replicate.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">YouTube is introducing some live streaming features that give content creators new ways to grow their audiences and interact with viewers. The updates were announced at the Made on YouTube event today, and include simultaneous horizontal and vertical streams, AI-powered livestream highlights, and the ability to livestream reactions to other live YouTube content on mobile devices.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">YouTube says that the new features announced today are “part of the largest upgrade to Live we’ve ever made.” The updates aim to attract more users to the platform&#8217;s livestreamed content, with the service reporting that more than 30 percent of daily logged-in viewers had watched live content in YouTube’s second quarter this year.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The first feature allows creators to stream both horizontally and vertically at the same time, giving viewers across both mobile and desktop formats a more optimized experience. This is combined with a single unified chat room that enables viewers to interact with each other, regardless of the format they’re watching. This is currently in the testing stages, according to YouTube, and is expected to expand to more creators “in the coming months.”</p>
<img src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/Stream-Across-Formats-product-mock.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100" alt="An example of the simultaneous horizontal and vertical streams in Creator Studio." title="An example of the simultaneous horizontal and vertical streams in Creator Studio." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="&lt;em&gt;Creators will be able to see both stream formats in Creator Studio to track framing.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: YouTube" data-portal-copyright="Image: YouTube" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Creators will also be able to react in real-time to eligible livestreams on YouTube. The feature allows streamers to go live on mobile alongside content like live events and keynote announcements, building on the popularity of reaction streams on YouTube and Twitch, but with fewer concerns around licensing and copyright restrictions. YouTube says it will start testing live content reactions “early next year before we expand further.”</p>
<img src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/YouTube-livestream-reactions.gif?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100" alt="A GIF demonstrating YouTube’s upcoming live reactions feature." title="A GIF demonstrating YouTube’s upcoming live reactions feature." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="&lt;em&gt;Watch this space to see your favorite tech and gaming YouTuber’s streaming live reactions to event keynotes.&lt;/em&gt; | GIF: YouTube" data-portal-copyright="GIF: YouTube" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">YouTube is giving creators on mobile devices AI-powered livestream highlights that automatically turn stream clips into Shorts “in the next few weeks,” and the ability to practice streaming on the mobile app until they’re ready to launch a real livestream sometime later this year. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/28/24166363/youtube-games-playables-youtube-premium">“Playables” games</a> that YouTube launched last year will also soon allow streamers to play while interacting with their viewers in vertical livestreams. This is rolling out to some creators next month, before expanding later this year.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Some of the updates specifically focus on helping creators to monetize their content. A feature is currently rolling out to creators with channel memberships that allows them to transition between public and members-only livestreams, for example, encouraging viewers to become paying channel members to avoid missing out. Ads displayed to the side of YouTube livestreams that already appear on desktop and TV will also be expanding to mobile devices later this year.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“Grounded in community feedback, these features are designed to help creators get discovered, grow their channel, and increase their earnings,” Aaron Filner, YouTube’s senior director of product management, said in a blog post. It&#8217;s good to see YouTube showing its livestream content creators some love after its persistent fixation on Shorts, but we’ll have to see if these updates could help the platform compete with livestream-focused services like Twitch.</p>
