<p class="has-text-align-none">An unlisted and now-removed video from Meta showed off a new pair of Ray-Ban branded smart glasses with a display and a wristband to help control them, <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-design-hud-wristband-clips-leak/">as reported by <em>UploadVR</em></a>. The video also features a new pair of wraparound “Sphaera” Oakley smart glasses with a camera on the nose, meaning that Meta itself may have inadvertently leaked two of its biggest announcements from its Connect event this week.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">For the glasses with a display, the video includes branding that says “Meta | Ray-Ban” and “Display,” so perhaps Meta will call them the Meta Ray-Ban Display. Based on a brief clip included in <em>UploadVR’s</em> article, the actual display is in the right lens of the glasses, and the clip shows how the glasses will let you do things like ask Meta AI a question, look at a map on the glasses to help you navigate, translate a sign, or use your hand with the wristband to “write” a reply to a chat.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Earlier this year, CNBC <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/22/meta-hypernova-ar-glasses-wristband.html">reported that</a> the wristband for Meta’s codenamed “Hypernova” glasses with a display would use surface electromyography (sEMG) technology to interpret signals from hand movements to help you control the device, so the clip is presumably showing that tech in action.</p>

President Donald Trump is trying to smooth things over with South Korea after his administration arrested hundreds of workers at a Hyundai plant in Georgia earlier this month.

<p class="has-text-align-none">President Donald Trump is trying to smooth things over with South Korea after his administration arrested hundreds of workers at a Hyundai plant in Georgia earlier this month. Just hours after <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz9j585g23go">reports indicated</a> that South Korea would open a human rights investigation into the detention of Korean employees, <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115204049358078594">Trump said</a> he doesn’t “want to frighten off” foreign investment into the US — something he has made a priority during his second administration.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">On September 4th, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents descended on the electric vehicle battery plant operated by Hyundai and LG Energy Solutions, detaining nearly 500 workers, including around 300 workers from South Korea. ICE officials claimed the workers overstayed their visas or weren’t permitted to work in the US, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/world/asia/south-korea-human-rights-abuses-hyundai-raid-trump-foreign-workers-rcna231289">according to NBC News</a>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Workers interviewed <a href="https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/foreignaffairs/20250914/shackled-and-chained-mass-detention-of-koreans-fuels-criticism-of-us">by <em>The Korea Times</em></a> say they were “shackled and handcuffed” and then brought to the ICE detention center in Folkston, Georgia, while their belongings and phones were confiscated. It’s not clear whether the workers were even eligible for deportation, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/12/business/economy/hyundai-raid-worker-visas.html">as <em>The New York Times</em></a> reported on Friday that “in at least one instance, officials admitted a worker was employed legally and forced him to leave the country anyway.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">As noted by the <em>Times</em>, many of the workers entered the US on a B1 visa for business travel, allowing them to stay in the US for less than six months, or on a visa waiver program, permitting them to stay for up to 90 days. Some companies use short-term visas instead of H-1B visas, which allow foreign workers to stay in the US for up to six years, because they’re cheaper, faster to obtain, and less restrictive. “Previous US administrations had largely turned a blind eye to the practice,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/sep/12/south-korean-outrage-at-us-detention-ordeal-as-300-workers-return-home">according to <em>The Guardian</em></a>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump has called on foreign companies to invest more money into the US to avoid paying costly tariffs. <a href="https://www.hyundainews.com/en-us/releases/4404">Hyundai responded with the announcement</a> in March that it would spend $21 billion in the US from 2025 to 2028, with plans to expand car production in the US to 1.2 million vehicles each year and improve its facilities. The removal of hundreds of workers could delay these plans, as Hyundai has already <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/11/business/hyundai-raid-plant-delay-ceo">pushed back the opening</a> of its Georgia factory.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The raid sparked outrage from South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, who <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly0e4k750go">called the move</a> “extremely bewildering” and said companies in the country will be “very hesitant” about pouring more money into the US. South Korea’s security advisor Wi Sung-Lac added that <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/society-equity/south-korea-says-provide-clear-visa-guidelines-its-companies-operating-us-2025-09-12/">the government would work</a> with the US to carve out clearer guidelines for visa requirements, as well as potentially develop a new category for Korean workers, according to <em>Reuters</em>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The incident puts the Trump administration on shaky ground with South Korea, which has long remained an ally of the US. In <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115204049358078594">a post on Truth Social</a>, President Trump wrote that he would like to bring foreign workers to the US to “teach and train” employees based in the US. “We welcome them, we welcome their employees, and we are willing to proudly say we will learn from them, and do even better than them at their own ‘game,’ sometime into the not too distant future!”</p>

One of Google’s top executives defended its use of AI summaries in search results during an AI summit in New York on Monday.&#160; When asked about a new lawsuit by Rolling Stone’s parent company, Penske Media Corporation, over Google’s AI Overviews, the company’s vice president of government affairs and public policy Markham Erickson said user [&#8230;]

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of Google’s top executives defended its use of AI summaries in search results during an <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/wired-ai-power-summit/?_sp=ad9a005b-2a9a-4329-bcd7-422e1f1eacb6.1757946172877">AI summit</a> in New York on Monday.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">When asked about a new lawsuit by <em>Rolling Stone</em>’s parent company, Penske Media Corporation, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/777788/rolling-stone-penske-media-sue-google-ai-overviews">over Google’s AI Overviews</a>, the company’s vice president of government affairs and public policy Markham Erickson said user preferences are shifting away from “factual answers” provided by original websites to the contextual summaries provided by AI Overviews, which appear at the top of the main page of search results. The company’s goal, Erickson said, is to maintain a “healthy ecosystem” with both AI summaries and regular search results, sometimes referred to as 10 blue links.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Evidence has emerged recently that suggests that search <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/720069/google-ai-overviews-search-web-traffic-stable">traffic plummets with AI summaries</a>. In its lawsuit, Penske alleged that this drop in search traffic leads to a decline in revenue for online publishers. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Here is what Erickson said when asked about the lawsuit:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none">So, I don&#8217;t want to speak about the specifics of the lawsuit, but I can speak to our philosophy here, which is, look, we want a healthy ecosystem. The 10 blue links serve the ecosystem very well, and it was a simple value proposition. We provided links that directed users free of charge to billions of publications around the world. We&#8217;re not going to abandon that model. We think that there&#8217;s use for that model. It&#8217;s still an important part of the ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But user preferences, and what users want, is also changing. So, instead of factual answers and 10 blue links, they&#8217;re increasingly wanting contextual answers and summaries. We want to be able to provide that, too, while at the same time, driving people back to content, valuable content, on the Internet. Where that valuable content is for users, is shifting. And so it&#8217;s a dynamic space. Ultimately, our goal is to ensure that we have an overall healthy ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Copilot Chat is secure AI chat grounded in the web—and now, it’s available in the Microsoft 365 apps,” explains Seth Patton, general Manager of Microsoft 365 Copilot product marketing. “It’s content aware, meaning it quickly understands what you’re working on, tailoring answers to the file you have open. And it’s included at no additional cost for Microsoft 365 users.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">While this free version of Copilot will rewrite documents, provide summaries, and help create slides in PowerPoint, the $30 per month, per user Microsoft 365 Copilot license will still have the best integration in Office apps. The Microsoft 365 Copilot license is also not limited to a single document, and can reason over entire work data.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Users with a Microsoft 365 Copilot license get priority access to features like file upload and image generation, along with the latest technology like GPT-5, including faster response times and more consistent availability—even during peak usage periods,“ explains Patton.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Microsoft previously bundled its AI-powered Copilot features into Office apps for consumer Microsoft 365 plans earlier this year, but it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24345051/microsoft-365-personal-family-copilot-office-ai-price-rises">raised the prices of subscriptions</a> at the same time.

Microsoft is also getting ready to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/776235/microsoft-365-copilot-bundle-sales-service-finance-announcement">bundle its sales, service, and finance Copilots</a> into the Microsoft 365 Copilot subscription in October, reducing the price for some businesses that rely on Microsoft’s latest AI tools.</p>

Haven’t you heard? Phones are boring now. And that’s just fine! Most people buying a new phone just want something familiar that works better than the device they’re replacing. If that’s your MO, then you’re sure to find something reliable in my recommendations below. But even if you’re looking for something a little more extra, [&#8230;]

<p>Haven’t you heard? <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/610404/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-review-screen-battery-camera">Phones are boring now</a>. And that’s just fine! Most people buying a new phone just want something familiar that works better than the device they’re replacing. If that’s your MO, then you’re sure to find something reliable in my recommendations below.</p>
<p>But even if you’re looking for something a little more <em>extra</em>, you’ve got some great options. They’re going to be pretty iterative compared to whatever you’re using now — we’re in more of a software era than a hardware innovation cycle these days — but you can find a delightful new device. We finally have a folding phone that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/709990/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">feels like the right size and shape</a>, flip phones offer <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/715325/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-review">a lot more than just nostalgia</a>, and you can still buy a phone with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/604154/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review-ai-screen-battery">no fewer than four cameras on the back</a>. Not bad for a boring season of phone hardware.</p>
<p>A lot of people in the US get their phones through carrier deals, and no judgment here if that’s the route you take — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/20/23730130/apple-iphone-13-mini-apple-phones">it’s how I bought mine</a>. Just be sure you know what you’re getting into and how many years you’ll need to stay on that Super 5G Everything Unlimited Plus plan to keep the monthly device reimbursements coming.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to spend a little less and still get the best smartphone on a budget, you can find something really good for under $600. For those recommendations, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21420196/best-budget-smartphone-cheap">check out our guide to budget smartphones</a>.</p>

<p>From a hardware perspective, the iPhone 16 (or the 16 Plus) is an easy upgrade choice. If you’re switching from an iPhone 13, 12, or even older, those four or five years of incremental performance improvements add up. But there’s something entirely new this time around — well, two things: the Action Button and the Camera Control button.</p>
<p>The customizable <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24246068/apple-iphone-16-pro-action-button-ios-shortcuts-uses-examples">Action Button</a>, which replaces the mute switch on the left edge of the phone, is a hand-me-down from the 15 Pro series. You can set it to open a particular app, turn on the flashlight, or almost anything else you might want at the press of a button. On the other side of the phone is the Camera Control, which you can use to launch the camera app. With the camera open, it acts as a shutter button with a full press, and a light press brings up other exposure options you can adjust. Even if you only ever use it to launch the camera, it’s pretty handy, and it frees up the Action Button.</p>
<img src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25626683/DSC08407.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100" alt="iPhone 16 in blue and iPhone 16 Plus in pink." title="iPhone 16 in blue and iPhone 16 Plus in pink." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 16 Plus (left) and its smaller sibling, the iPhone 16 (right).&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: Allison Johnson / The Verge" data-portal-copyright="Photo: Allison Johnson / The Verge" />
<p>The iPhone 16 and its larger 16 Plus sibling use Apple’s A18 chipset, which is in the same family as the 16 Pro’s processor. That bodes well for the phones staying on the same software upgrade cycle. They both received Apple Intelligence last fall, which included AI-powered writing tools and notification summaries in its earliest iteration, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/11/24317119/ios-18-2-apple-intelligence-chatgpt-genmoji">eventually grew to support ChatGPT</a> and a new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/9/24240094/apple-visual-intelligence-camera-control-iphone-16-ai-camera-control-google-lens">Visual Intelligence</a> feature. But despite the similarities, the regular 16 models lag behind the Pros in two important departments: the screen and the camera.</p>
<p>The Pros come with dedicated 5x lenses and updated main cameras that do a little better in low light. And you’ll only get a ProMotion display on the Pro models; the regular 16 features a slower 60Hz screen. Basically every other high-end phone on the market offers a 120Hz display, so that’s a disappointment given the price. If those two drawbacks don’t bother you — and most people probably won’t mind them — then the iPhone 16 makes for a great upgrade.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Pixel 10 is an easygoing Android phone that offers some handy upgrades over its predecessor. The addition of Qi2 with built-in magnets is a delight, making it easier than ever to quickly charge up without plugging in. AI features like Magic Cue, which can proactively suggest information based on what you’re doing on your phone, are finally showing promise. And for the first time ever, the base model features a dedicated telephoto lens.</p>
<img src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/257937_Google_Pixel_10_review_AJohnson_0001.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0.012500000000003,0,99.975,100" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="" />
<p>But, alas, there’s a catch: The Pixel 10 no longer features the same main and ultrawide camera hardware as the Pro. You’re essentially getting the two rear cameras found in the midrange Pixel 9A, plus a telephoto lens. Still, as a whole, the device’s triple camera system produces images that are totally fine. Beyond the cameras, the Pixel 10 features the same Tensor G5 chipset that’s found in the Pro phones — handy for those aforementioned AI features.</p>
<p>Overall, the Pixel 10 mostly improves upon what made last year’s Pixel 9 such a solid release. We’re not thrilled with the downgraded camera, but the addition of Qi2 and a telephoto lens helps to soften the blow. If you can live with the camera trade-offs, the Pixel 10 is still a smart pick for anyone who wants a flagship experience at a more approachable price.</p>

<p>Samsung’s “Ultra” S-series phone is still your best bet for a maximalist Android phone, even if ultra doesn’t quite mean what it once did. You still get four rear cameras — including a 3x and 5x telephoto — a massive screen, and a built-in S Pen stylus. The battery goes all day, the processor is top-notch, and there are AI features aplenty if you’re into that sort of thing. There’s just no other phone quite like it. </p>

<p>This year, Samsung removed the Bluetooth features from the stylus. That stings a little, especially considering that the company swapped a 10x zoom for the shorter 5x camera the year before. It still amounts to a great phone, but it’s one of the priciest slab-style phones you can buy, and Samsung seems to be cutting features without adding back any extra value. It’s still “ultra” alright, but it doesn’t feel quite as special as it used to.</p>

<p>Every year, we’re pleasantly surprised by how much Google packs into its midrange Pixel A-series devices. Last year, it was the Pixel 8A, and this year, it’s the even better Pixel 9A. For $500, the 9A offers Google’s fourth-gen custom Tensor G4 chipset (the very same chip that’s in the pricier Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro), a brighter and larger 6.3-inch OLED display, and an IP68 rating for improved durability. Plus, you get the benefit of seven years of software updates and security support. What you end up with is a device that delivers fantastic value, especially compared to other <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21420196/best-budget-smartphone-cheap">inexpensive devices</a>.</p>

<p>The Pixel 9A offers a handful of other features that put it above the pack, like a 120Hz refresh rate, wireless charging, and the largest battery across the Pixel line. It does fall short in a few areas, though — the camera’s low light performance and Portrait mode could be better. That said, the 9A’s camera is still great for everyday snaps, and for the price, the device is an easy recommendation as the best in this category.</p>

<p>Like all mainline iPhone 16 models, the 16 Pro gained the new Camera Control button, but it got another important update, too: a 5x telephoto lens. In the 15 series, that longer telephoto lens was reserved for the bigger Pro Max model. This time around, it’s on the smaller Pro, too, making it a great option for someone who wants to upgrade without upsizing their phone.</p>
<p>Like the Pro Max, the iPhone 16 Pro uses an A18 Pro chipset designed to support Apple Intelligence, which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/28/24272995/apple-intelligence-now-available-ios-18-1-mac-ipad">started rolling out in the fall of 2024</a>. The first update included things like notification summaries and the new glowing-border Siri UI, which Apple centered its launch event on. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/11/24317119/ios-18-2-apple-intelligence-chatgpt-genmoji">Subsequent updates</a> brought ChatGPT integration and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/9/24240094/apple-visual-intelligence-camera-control-iphone-16-ai-camera-control-google-lens">Visual Intelligence</a>. But <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/31/24209910/apple-intelligence-ios-18-preview-siri">don’t expect anything radical</a> — at least at first.</p>

<p>Outside of AI, the 16 Pro is a fairly iterative update. The new Camera Control makes it easier to launch the camera and get right to taking photos, and it also frees up the Action Button if you were using it as a camera shortcut. The screen is a little bigger at 6.3 inches compared to 6.1 inches, even though the phone is basically the same size. You can record 4K video at 120fps now. And the new Photographic Styles, which are available on all iPhone 16 models, let you take more control over your photos than ever.</p>
<p>There’s nothing here that someone with an iPhone 15 Pro should upgrade for, but it’s an all-around solid device that will please Apple devotees, especially those who prefer a phone that isn’t too big.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Samsung finally got the memo with the Galaxy Z Flip 7’s cover screen. The company’s latest flip phone ditches the file folder-shaped look of its predecessor for a 4.1-inch, edge-to-edge display that wraps around the cameras. With more outer screen real estate, it’s easier to respond to texts and punch in a coffee order without flipping open the phone and getting sucked into a digital rabbit hole.</p>
<p>The Flip 7 still makes you jump through a few hoops if you want to run full apps on the cover screen, but once you’ve wrangled the settings, it unlocks a lot of convenience for everyday tasks. That said, the cover screen isn’t perfect for every app. Sometimes a button hides behind the camera cutout, forcing you to change the app’s window size. But most tasks are a breeze, and opening the phone is always an option.</p>
<img src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/257866_Samsung_Galaxy_Z_Flip_7_review_AJohnson_0004.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0.012500000000003,0,99.975,100" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="&lt;em&gt;Finally, Samsung went with an edge-to-edge cover screen.&lt;/em&gt;" data-portal-copyright="" />
<p>Under the hood, Samsung swapped out Qualcomm’s processor for an in-house Exynos chip, though we didn’t notice any hits to performance. The new 4,300mAh battery will last you all day with moderate use, but heavy gaming and hotspot use will significantly impact battery life. The camera system, meanwhile, remains unchanged from the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24211507/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review-screen-battery-camera">Z Flip 6</a>, which isn’t a bad thing. You still get a 50-megapixel main shooter and all the fun flex mode tricks, which are great for capturing candids.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Flip 7 still offers no protection against fine particles like dust or sand, which might work their way into the hinge and cause damage. This raises concerns about how the device hold up over time. But Samsung’s beefed-up warranty and repair program can provide extra peace of mind. Plus, with seven years of OS and security updates, the Flip 7 should prove reliable until you decide to upgrade.</p>

<p>One of our biggest criticisms of the Z Fold series has been that it feels too narrow and cramped when closed. The Galaxy Z Fold 7 fixes that. With a more familiar 21:9 aspect ratio, it no longer feels like you’re holding a TV remote control. The result is a book-style foldable that mostly feels like a regular slab-style phone. It’s nearly as slim, too, so it doesn’t feel as bulky in your pocket.</p>
<img src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/257857_Samsung_Galaxy_Z_Fold_7_review_AJohnson_0006.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0.02498750624688,100,99.950024987506" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="&lt;em&gt;The large inner screen gives you ample room for multitasking.&lt;/em&gt;" data-portal-copyright="" />
<p>The Z Fold 7’s reworked proportions make it easier to wield when replying to texts and Slack messages. When you start craving more screen real estate, the device opens to reveal a spacious 8-inch inner display, giving you an entirely different experience that’s perfect for managing multiple tabs in Chrome and playing games like <em>Diablo Immortal</em>. It’s great for multitasking — being able to track your Uber driver’s arrival time on one half of the screen while replying to emails on the other half is incredibly useful.</p>
<p>The bad news? The Z Fold 7 costs $1,999, making the barrier of entry very high. It also has one of the largest camera bumps we’ve encountered in a phone and doesn’t carry a formal dust resistance rating, meaning even a small amount of dust has the potential to cause significant damage to the hinge. Despite these shortcomings, however, Samsung has created a luxurious foldable that’s thinner, lighter, and incredibly nice to use.</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The <strong>Samsung Galaxy S25</strong> is a very good device, and it’s basically the last small-ish Android phone you can buy in the US. I find the software to be fussier and more cluttered than the Pixel 9’s, so it’s not my overall pick, but it’s a reliable device — and your best bet for a phone that isn’t gigantic. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/610404/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-review-screen-battery-camera">Read our review</a>.</li>
<li>The <strong>iPhone 16E</strong> is a great phone that makes a lot of interesting trade-offs. Apple’s latest entry-level phone starts at $599 and comes with the company’s latest A18 processor, USB-C and wireless charging, a 60Hz OLED display, and the customizable Action Button found on Apple’s more premium handsets. The 6.1-inch phone doesn’t have MagSafe support or a Camera Control button, though, and it’s limited to a single 48-megapixel Fusion camera (sorry, ultrawide stans). That makes it hard for us to recommend over the standard iPhone 16, even if it does start at $200 less. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/620155/iphone-16e-review-c1-modem-battery-camera">Read our review</a>.</li>
<li>The <strong>Motorola Razr Ultra 2025</strong> is an excellent foldable that exemplifies what makes the brand’s phones so unique. It’s one of the best-looking phones you can buy, thanks to its gold-bronze chassis and wooden back. Plus, it features a spacious cover screen that’s handy for quickly performing tasks without opening the device. However, as much as we enjoy the Razr Ultra, Motorola’s promise of three OS upgrades and four years of security updates is on the shorter side. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/667277/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review-battery-screen">Read our review</a>.</li>
<li>The <strong>Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge</strong> is an ultra-thin alternative to the big, chunky flagships we’ve seen over the past year. At just 5.8mm thick, it packs a 6.7-inch 1440p OLED display with a refresh rate of up to 120Hz, a 3,900mAh battery, and a Snapdragon 8 Elite processor. Despite its thinner frame, battery life is surprisingly acceptable, though it won’t last as long as other flagship devices. The S25 Edge also lacks a telephoto camera, so it’s not the best phone for portrait photos. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/680383/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-review-battery-screen">Read our review</a>.</li>
<li>The <strong>OnePlus 13R</strong> stands out in two key ways: battery life and screen. The 6.78-inch OLED display has a variable refresh rate of up to 120Hz and a resolution of 1264 x 2780, both of which are great specs for a midrange phone. Meanwhile, its 6,000mAh battery can last for a long time — most people are likely to squeeze out two days before the device needs to be recharged. That said, the 13R lacks features like wireless charging and more robust water resistance, and OnePlus is only promising four major OS upgrades and six years of security updates, which is fewer than the seven years of OS upgrades on the Google Pixel 9A. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/656305/oneplus-13r-review-maybe-just-buy-a-pixel-9a">Read our review</a>.</li>
<li>The&nbsp;<strong>Nothing Phone 3</strong> is the brand’s “first true flagship phone,” with a 6.67-inch OLED screen, a Snapdragon 8S Gen 4 chip, and a 5,150mAh battery. It also features four cameras — three on the back and one on the front — all of which are 50 megapixels. Additionally, the Phone 3 ditches Nothing’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/695788/nothing-phone-3-launch-news-specs-price">signature light strips</a>&nbsp;for a small dot-matrix LED display on the back, which can display images or emoji tied to specific apps and contacts. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/mobile/709093/nothing-phone-3-review">Read our review</a>.</li>
<li>The&nbsp;<strong>Pixel 9 Pro Fold</strong>&nbsp;is an impressive sophomore effort from Google. Like the Z Fold 7, the outer screen matches the dimensions of a regular slab-style phone, while the inner screen is great for multitasking. The whole package is also light enough that it sometimes doesn’t feel like you’re holding a foldable, though it does suffer from a slightly downgraded camera system compared to other Pixel 9 devices. There’s also no formal dust resistance, so long-term durability remains a concern.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/24237586/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review-screen-camera-battery">Read our review</a>.</li>
<li>The <strong>Pixel 10 Pro</strong> is Google’s most refined flagship yet, blending a premium design with meaningful hardware upgrades like the Tensor G5 chip and Pixelsnap wireless charging. Magic Cue delivers genuinely useful on-device AI that can surface helpful info in real-time, while the camera’s portrait mode is much improved over its predecessor. Battery life is just average, though, and some AI features still feel like they’re being shoved into corners of the device where it doesn’t really need to be. Most readers will be better served by the cheaper Pixel 10. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/766613/google-pixel-10-pro-review-ai-magic-cue-camera-pro-res-zoom">Read our review</a>.</li>

<li>Google’s <strong>Pixel 10 Pro Fold</strong> is the first foldable to earn an IP68 rating, meaning it offers robust water and dust resistance.

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the biggest changes coming to all of Apple’s operating systems is the company’s new Liquid Glass design language that updates windows, notifications, app icons, and other UI elements with a transparent glassy appearance revealing what’s beneath them. For the Apple Watch, the Liquid Glass update <a href="https://www.theverge.com/apple/683914/apple-iphone-ios-26-changes-liquid-glass">isn’t quite as dramatic a change</a> as it is for the iPhone and iOS 26. You’ll mostly notice a new glossy appearance to icons and buttons in the Smart Stack, Control Center, and apps, and with watch faces that mix text and photos.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A new wrist flick gesture (that looks easier than the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23930197/double-tap-apple-watch-how-to-use">previous finger pinch double tap gesture</a>) lets you silence timers, mute calls, and dismiss notifications by rotating your wrist away from you. With watchOS 26 the Apple Watch can also automatically adjust the volume of calls, notifications, and Siri based on ambient noise, making them quieter when the din dies down. And for the first time, Apple’s Notes app will be available on the Apple Watch, including the ability to create new notes or asking Siri to do that for you.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Hypertension notifications, announced alongside the Apple Watch Series 11 and Ultra 3 last week, are also coming with watchOS 26. The health feature uses the Apple Watch’s existing optical sensor to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/776942/apple-watch-hypertension-feature-cleared-by-fda">collect data about how blood vessels respond to heart beats</a> over a 30 day period to detect signs of high blood pressure and notify users.

<p class="has-text-align-none">New Apple Watch health features being introduced today include a new sleep score that evaluates the quality of your slumber based on your sleep duration, interruptions throughout the night, and how consistent your bedtime is. It joins a new Workout Buddy, powered by Apple Intelligence, that uses your fitness history to provide motivational messages and insights during a workout such as pep talks letting you know how far you are from your activity goal.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Other watchOS 26 upgrades include configurable widgets in the Smart Stack so you can prioritize ones you access frequently, automatic message translations using Apple Intelligence, and new watch faces. Supported Apple Watch models will also get access to the iPhone’s Hold Assist and Call Screening features that can ask people why they’re calling or remain on hold on your behalf and send a notification once a live agent is available.</p>
