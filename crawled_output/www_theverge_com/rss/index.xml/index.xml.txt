<p class="has-text-align-none">TikTok might not finalize its deal to sell its US operations for at least another month. Sources <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/16/tiktok-bytedance-oracle-china.html">tell CNBC’s David Faber</a> that the US and China might close on an agreement within the next 30 to 45 days, while Oracle will remain the app’s cloud partner, allowing it to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/631999/oracle-tiktok-ban-deal-project-texas">continue routing US user data</a> on American servers.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">On Monday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters that the US and China <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/778087/tiktok-ban-framework-deal-us-china-trump">have reached a “framework deal”</a> for TikTok. He added that President Donald Trump would confirm the deal on Friday — two days after TikTok’s latest deadline to divest expires. Trump has already given TikTok <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/688252/tiktok-ban-trump-extension-deal">three extensions to negotiate a deal</a>, and it’s unclear whether he’ll grant TikTok another while the company finalizes an agreement.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">TikTok’s future in the US became shrouded in uncertainty after the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/24/24139036/biden-signs-tiktok-ban-bill-divest-foreign-aid-package">federal government passed</a> the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, which mandates that TikTok must divest from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, or face a ban in the US due to national security concerns. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">On Tuesday, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/china-agrees-tiktok-deal-u-s-includes-algorithm-licensing?utm_campaign=%5BREBRAND%5D+%5BTI-AM%5D+Th&amp;utm_content=1095&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=cio&amp;utm_term=124"><em>The Information</em> reported</a> that the US and China have reached an agreement on the “licensing of TikTok’s algorithms and other intellectual property rights.” Previous reports suggested that TikTok <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/698999/tiktok-ban-sale-rumor-new-app-oracle">could launch a separate version</a> of its app for US users. As noted by CNBC, a group of investment firms, including some existing ByteDance shareholders, could gain control of TikTok’s US operations.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“’I’m hearing it’s [the deal] actually going to be relatively small in terms of the actual size of the checks that are written for the entity itself, and it will not be something that is going to go public at some point,” Faber said during CNBC’s <em>Squawk on the Street</em>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Influencers and content creators are many things beyond their public personas. All but the biggest figures likely do some combination of the following jobs themselves: content moderator, video editor, photographer, social media strategist, script writer, idea generator. What if they could outsource much of that work to AI? And what if it were the social media platforms themselves that provided them with the tools to do so?  </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">At the Made On YouTube event, held Tuesday in New York, the company unveiled a slew of new AI features aimed at content creators, many of which focus on all the behind-the-scenes work that goes into a video. Unlike previous tools — like an <a href="http://theverge.com/news/647422/youtube-ai-music-assistant-generator-background">AI background music generator</a> or tools that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/21/23883749/youtube-generative-ai-dream-screen-creators">create AI photos and videos</a> — the new batch are largely content strategy features, marketed as helping creators reach new audiences (and more effectively get in front of their existing base).</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Among the new tools is Ask Studio, an AI chatbot that creators can use to ask analytics questions about how their content is performing. Amjad Hanif, VP of product management, describes it as a “creative partner”: how is the audience responding to a video? What are the most compelling moments of a video? The tool pulls in data from across a YouTube channel, including longform videos and Shorts — essentially a faster and more direct analytics tool that’s built into the platform. Creators can ask the tool to do things like summarize comments and synthesize viewer sentiment, and ask for suggestions based on data: if YouTube reports a drop off in viewership at a certain part, Ask Studio will spit out advice for next time on optimizing that section of the video. Creators can also ask for things like “video ideas from comments on my latest video,” and then follow up with requests for title suggestions. For now, the tool can’t compare one channel versus another (queries like “What videos from my competitors are performing well?”).</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Also rolling out is a new thumbnail and title A / B testing feature, building upon a thumbnail testing version that was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/11/24176325/youtube-thumbnails-test-compare-a-b">announced last year</a>. With this update, creators can pair thumbnail images and titles and run tests to see which performs the best; the “winner” is the combination that has the highest watch time.</p>
<img src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/image-4-5.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=6.4485081809432,0,87.102983638114,100" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="Image: YouTube" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">“No matter how good the video is, the thumbnail and title is what gets people to even see the video and see if it&#8217;s good or not. It might be the most important thing, honestly,” says Ashley Alexander, a lifestyle influencer who was given early access and who has been testing some of the tools. Alexander says she uses the thumbnail-only testing feature for every video and has begun integrating the new thumbnail and title A / B testing tool into her workflow.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The influx of tools essentially meant to help creators optimize for the YouTube algorithm are something of a paradigm shift. For years, creators ran their own tests to figure out what worked best for each social media platform: how to write the most enticing title or whether to have <a href="https://x.com/MrBeast/status/1699459457002918138?lang=en">a closed or open mouth in a thumbnail</a>. It was trial and error, with creators trying to sort through what kind of content the platforms preferred. Now, some platforms themselves directly tell creators <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/1/24259462/instagram-best-practices-business-profiles-tips-reach">what they should post</a>, and how — TikTok tells creators what topics are trending and even what their followers are searching for in the app, with explicit nudges that creators should make videos that target those searches. The effect is two-fold: it’s a way for YouTube and other platforms to more directly guide what creators make. “Optimizing” content is also potentially beneficial to both creators and YouTube itself — both parties want viewers to be spending more time on the platform, watching their videos.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/image-3-6.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=1.25,0,97.5,100" alt="YouTube’s Ask Studio analytics chatbot" title="YouTube’s Ask Studio analytics chatbot" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="Image: YouTube" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">YouTube is also expanding some viewer-facing AI tools <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/654039/youtube-expands-its-auto-dubbing-feature-again">like dubbing</a>. Previously creators had access to an auto-dubbing feature — now, the feature will also sync the YouTuber’s lips to match the dubbed language. Content that uses YouTube’s AI dubbing feature will have a badge underneath the title and in the video description indicating it was auto-dubbed. Creators won’t be able to go through and correct or tweak mis-translated portions after uploading.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Separately, creators will also have the option to add multiple collaborators to a single video — essentially a cross-posting feature. Each collaborator will be able to see performance metrics for the video.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The AI creep into influencing and content creation has been happening for a while, and across industries: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/692286/ai-bots-llm-onlyfans">adult content creators are using chatbots</a> to interact with paying clients and platforms are encouraging advertisers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/684572/tiktok-ai-advertising-videos-try-on-product-placement">to use AI-generated models</a> to sell products. When YouTube recently updated its monetization rules, many creators <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/703772/youtube-monetization-policy-update-ai-spam">understood</a> the “inauthentic content” policy was taking aim at AI-generated mass produced videos. Some creators were concerned about what exactly qualified as &#8220;inauthentic,&#8221; how YouTube would screen content, and how it would decide what to demonetize.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/26/24186635/baggu-collina-strada-collaboration-ai-purses-art">example</a> after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/9/23752354/ai-spfbo-cover-art-contest-midjourney-clarkesworld">example</a> of online and hobby communities <a href="https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/691355/ai-is-ruining-houseplant-communities-online">reckoning</a> with an influx of AI content — but does it matter if it’s happening behind the scenes? Do viewers care if their favorite YouTuber uses AI to come up with video topic ideas, like the platform encourages them to do? And if everyone is perfectly optimized for YouTube’s algorithm and relying on the same built-in tools, is anyone <em>really </em>optimized? Who wins when everyone’s thumbnail and title are just right, or when everyone is using the same AI tool to generate the perfect video topics and scripts?</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Creators like Alexander say the features are a jumping off point, not a cheat code: the AI-generated ideas are a good place to start, but she thinks ultimately she knows her audience best. For many content creators, their audiences buy into them as people making distinct creative choices, not just churning out whatever a chatbot suggests — that relationship is something AI can’t replicate.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">YouTube is introducing some live streaming features that give content creators new ways to grow their audiences and interact with viewers. The updates were announced at the Made on YouTube event today, and include simultaneous horizontal and vertical streams, AI-powered livestream highlights, and the ability to livestream reactions to other live YouTube content on mobile devices.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">YouTube says that the new features announced today are “part of the largest upgrade to Live we’ve ever made.” The updates aim to attract more users to the platform&#8217;s livestreamed content, with the service reporting that more than 30 percent of daily logged-in viewers had watched live content in YouTube’s second quarter this year.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The first feature allows creators to stream both horizontally and vertically at the same time, giving viewers across both mobile and desktop formats a more optimized experience. This is combined with a single unified chat room that enables viewers to interact with each other, regardless of the format they’re watching. This is currently in the testing stages, according to YouTube, and is expected to expand to more creators “in the coming months.”</p>
<img src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/Stream-Across-Formats-product-mock.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100" alt="An example of the simultaneous horizontal and vertical streams in Creator Studio." title="An example of the simultaneous horizontal and vertical streams in Creator Studio." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="&lt;em&gt;Creators will be able to see both stream formats in Creator Studio to track framing.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: YouTube" data-portal-copyright="Image: YouTube" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Creators will also be able to react in real-time to eligible livestreams on YouTube. The feature allows streamers to go live on mobile alongside content like live events and keynote announcements, building on the popularity of reaction streams on YouTube and Twitch, but with fewer concerns around licensing and copyright restrictions. YouTube says it will start testing live content reactions “early next year before we expand further.”</p>
<img src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/YouTube-livestream-reactions.gif?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100" alt="A GIF demonstrating YouTube’s upcoming live reactions feature." title="A GIF demonstrating YouTube’s upcoming live reactions feature." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="&lt;em&gt;Watch this space to see your favorite tech and gaming YouTuber’s streaming live reactions to event keynotes.&lt;/em&gt; | GIF: YouTube" data-portal-copyright="GIF: YouTube" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">YouTube is giving creators on mobile devices AI-powered livestream highlights that automatically turn stream clips into Shorts “in the next few weeks,” and the ability to practice streaming on the mobile app until they’re ready to launch a real livestream sometime later this year. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/28/24166363/youtube-games-playables-youtube-premium">“Playables” games</a> that YouTube launched last year will also soon allow streamers to play while interacting with their viewers in vertical livestreams. This is rolling out to some creators next month, before expanding later this year.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Some of the updates specifically focus on helping creators to monetize their content. A feature is currently rolling out to creators with channel memberships that allows them to transition between public and members-only livestreams, for example, encouraging viewers to become paying channel members to avoid missing out. Ads displayed to the side of YouTube livestreams that already appear on desktop and TV will also be expanding to mobile devices later this year.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“Grounded in community feedback, these features are designed to help creators get discovered, grow their channel, and increase their earnings,” Aaron Filner, YouTube’s senior director of product management, said in a blog post. It&#8217;s good to see YouTube showing its livestream content creators some love after its persistent fixation on Shorts, but we’ll have to see if these updates could help the platform compete with livestream-focused services like Twitch.</p>

<li>An experimental feature will give “top viewers the opportunity to buy exclusive merch” from their favorite creators. This began testing earlier this year, but YouTube doesn’t have any details available about when it’ll be available.</li>

Weighing over 16 pounds it’s not designed with portability in mind, but with 3,600 lumens of output, it’s Epson’s brightest Lifestudio projector — and the loudest, with a pair of 45mm speakers and an 80mm subwoofer.</p>

If you go the battery route to improve its portability, Epson says a 24,000mAh power bank will provide up to 70 minutes of movie watching.

<p class="has-text-align-none">Aurzen has announced a new portable projector that will be the first to run the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/lowpass-newsletter/776248/roku-ai-ads">Roku TV</a> OS already found on TVs from brands like TCL and Hisense. The new Aurzen D1R Cube will have access to popular streaming apps like Netflix, Disney Plus, and Amazon Prime, plus <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395533/roku-originals-quibi-content-tv">Roku Originals</a> and over <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23680217/fast-services-tubi-roku-pluto-tv">500 FAST live channels</a>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The D1R Cube is available starting today for $169.99 through <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FDGLZKKM?th=1">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://aurzen.com/">Aurzen’s online store</a> in gray, white, and green color options. Alongside the $299 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/621360/aurzen-zip-projector-review-tri-fold-specs-price">tri-fold Zip</a>, the Cube will be one of Aurzen’s most aggressively priced projectors. But its limited capabilities will potentially make it better suited as a portable solution for bringing movie night along on your next camping trip instead of the centerpiece of your home theater setup.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Aurzen says the Cube is capable of projecting an image up to 150 inches in size. With just 330 ANSI lumens of brightness, though, you’ll want a reflective screen and a completely dark room to avoid an image that’s dim or washed-out. For comparison, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/765735/anker-nebula-x1-pro-party-speaker-price-specs">Soundcore Nebula X1 Pro projector</a> that Anker announced at IFA 2025 boasts 3,500 ANSI lumens of brightness. And while the Cube does support 4K content, it only displays it at 1080p.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite its budget-minded pricing, the D1R Cube includes features like automatic focus and keystone adjustments for easier setup, 5W built-in speakers located on either side, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth for connecting the projector to louder wireless speakers or headphones. It also supports Apple AirPlay so you can stream video and audio directly from your iPhone and iPad. You can use Roku’s mobile app as a remote control with voice commands, and Roku Smart Home lets you get notifications from other smart devices around your home, including access to live feeds from security cameras.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The majority of the all-in-one projectors available today, including models from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/685361/xgimi-mogo-series-4-projectors-laser">Xgimi</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/707436/nebula-x1-review-best-portable-projector-price-specs">Anker</a>, feature Google TV. Although that OS provides access to a larger variety of apps (including games) when compared to Roku TV, many entry-level projectors running Google TV have not been certified to natively access Netflix, requiring additional hardware like a dongle to use one of the most popular streaming apps. Roku TV provides not only that app but access to a lot of subscription-free content, including FAST channels and the library from the defunct streaming platform Quibi, which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220426/quibi-roku-channel-acquisition-content">Roku acquired in early 2021</a>.</p>

AT&#38;T is testing an AI-powered assistant designed to screen phone calls for you.

<p class="has-text-align-none">AT&amp;T is testing an AI-powered assistant designed to screen phone calls for you. The mobile carrier is bringing the feature to a select group of customers this year, and likens it to a “digital receptionist” that can identify and filter out robocallers based on the information from its network, like your call history.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“This is only the foundation of what it can do,” Andy Markus, AT&amp;T’s chief data officer, tells <em>The Verge</em>, adding that the AI assistant could eventually help you make reservations or schedule appointments in the future, similar to what you can do <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/603501/google-ask-for-me-search-labs">with Google’s AI assistant</a>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">When you receive a call from an unknown number, AT&amp;T’s AI assistant will pick up and ask for more information about who’s calling and why. The AI assistant will patch the call through to you if it meets certain criteria, such as whether it determines the caller is human based on the sound of its voice or if it detects a sense of urgency. Otherwise, it can take a message or hang up.</p>
<img src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/att-digital-receptionist.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="Image: AT&amp;T" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">AT&amp;T will use the information from its network to determine whether a caller is someone you interact with frequently, but you’ll also be able to put numbers on a “Do Not Screen” list, allowing calls from lesser-used numbers, like your doctor’s office or your child’s school, to go directly to you.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Markus says that building the AI agent directly into the carrier’s network is what helps make it stand out from other call-screening features, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24323787/android-google-samsung-phone-calls-how-to">those launched by Google</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/777466/apple-ios-26-launch-iphone-liquid-glass-update">Apple</a>. “Using the network, it understands the pattern that you as a consumer have,” Markus says. “Based on what we understand through the network, if my brother calls, we see that I interact with my brother all the time. Of course, that call should go through.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Google’s Call Screen feature, on the other hand, <a href="https://support.google.com/phoneapp/answer/9094888?sjid=785130417043028723-NA">uses your phone’s contact list</a> to determine if you know an incoming caller. It also detects spam based on what the caller says, as well as by comparing numbers against its database of known spammers and robocallers.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But AT&amp;T’s on-network assistant doesn’t need a specific device to use the feature. AT&amp;T will also let you see the AI assistant’s transcript in real time from its app, allowing you to keep tabs on the conversation while it happens. You can pick up the call at any time, or let the AI assistant handle it and provide an AI-generated summary of what it gathered.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now that iOS 26 is out I’ve been eagerly waiting to see if Apple would update its Sports app with a widget I could use in my car. The good news is that Apple Sports <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/09/apple-sports-adds-widgets-and-expands-to-eight-new-countries/">now has an iOS widget</a> that can be used on your homescreen. The bad news is that you can’t use it in iOS 26’s new CarPlay widgets feature.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The Apple Sports widget shows upcoming fixtures for your favorite teams, or live scores if your team is currently playing a game. It’s now one of the only free sports apps on iOS that incorporates all of Apple’s latest features, including Live Activities support for seeing scores on your lockscreen or in CarPlay, without ads getting in the way.</p>
<img src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/20250916_122302000_iOS.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="&lt;em&gt;The new Apple Sports widget.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot by Tom Warren / The Verge" data-portal-copyright="Screenshot by Tom Warren / The Verge" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">I was really hoping Apple would make its widget work on the new iOS 26 CarPlay widgets panel, particularly because Apple Sports supports a wide variety of sports and not just soccer. While I could use iOS 26’s new Live Activities feature in CarPlay, it’s only available in the CarPlay Dashboard, and not inside the new widgets panel.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The new widgets panel is great homescreen-like interface for CarPlay, and it’s far less cluttered than the typical dashboard UI. I could also use third-party apps like <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id488575683?pt=338473&amp;ct=twitter&amp;mt=8">FotMob</a>, but that’s limited to just soccer when I want to see tennis, Formula 1, and other sports as well as the NFL and soccer.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Alongside the new widget, Apple Sports is also getting more soccer with the addition of leagues including the Bundesliga 2, Ligue 2, Primeira Liga, Segunda División, and Serie B; other teams and leagues have also been added from Austria, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">If you have any good recommendations for sports apps on iOS that support Live Activities and CarPlay widgets, please respond in the comments section. I’m also looking out for any other interesting CarPlay widgets that are available thanks to iOS 26.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Considering all the tech that we cover here at <em>The Verge</em>, you’d think that the members of our staff would be using their phones, laptops, and other gadgets for all their productivity needs. But interestingly, when we asked people to talk about their favorite productivity tools, there was suddenly an enthusiastic discussion of notebooks, pens, and dry-erase boards.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Welcome to a not-so-secret society where members are concerned with the format of an analog notebook, the quality of its paper, and the available add-ons. Where article ideas, family activities, and interviews notes are jotted down rather than typed. And where productivity can be enhanced not by software, but rather by finding the right type of writing implement to use with your chosen notebook.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Curious? Here are some of the analog productivity tools that we use here at <em>The Verge</em>. They aren’t our only tools — let’s face it, this is <em>The Verge</em>, after all — but they work for us, so they might work for you, too.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After years of experimenting with every to-do app on the planet, I’ve gone back to my analog ways with the <a href="https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/lineup/">Hobonichi Techo</a> — the A5 Cousin and the smaller Hobonichi Weeks. Something about physically writing my stuff with a pen helps me keep track of what’s truly worth my time and what isn’t.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The Cousin is great for visualizing my time on a yearly, monthly, weekly, and daily basis. The Weeks version is what I use for both gratitude journaling and tracking my self-care, fitness, and reading. Both books have some extra pages in back for commonplace journaling (aka writing down random knowledge, brain dumps, reference notes, etc.). There’s also a smaller A6 size, if these are too large or skinny. All Hobonichi books have a dot-grid format, and the Tomoe River paper is <em>so </em>thin — but it takes a significant amount of ink to bleed through. I’ve been using these notebooks for almost two years now, and while they’re on the pricier end (especially if you buy them directly from Hobonichi, which is based in Japan, and have to add on shipping costs), they’ve absolutely helped me become a much more productive person and better writer. <em>—Victoria Song, senior reviewer</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These seem more like art experiments than functional notebooks, but I love objects that make you rethink how you should use them. I typically have Post-it notes or a spiral notebook on my desk so I can write something down or doodle during a meeting. The L-shaped Sidekick doesn’t take up a ton of space on my desk, opened or closed. The Triangle Notebook is actually great for using on your lap or other unconventional surfaces, as it is pretty sturdy and lays flat on its spine. Both notebooks also encourage me to use my handwriting more, which was a New Year’s resolution I had. <em>—Andru Marino, senior producer</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While I have a tendency to be constantly looking for different apps to use for either taking notes or tracking tasks, I have to admit that over the years I’ve gotten more use out of a simple notebook with removable pages than Notion, Keep, or Evernote. Sold by Levenger under the Circa name, the notebooks are bound with plastic discs that let you easily remove and replace the pages. I’ve got a red leather notebook in the <a href="https://www.levenger.com/collections/circa-compact-notebooks">Compact</a> size, which is just large enough to write comfortably in, but small enough to fit into my bag. (There are several sizes, ranging from the very small Jotlet to the considerably larger Letter.) Plastic tabs divide the pages into sections; my usual habit is to just open to the first empty page, grab my pen from the attached loop, and write. Later, I can move the page to the appropriate section, remove it for storage, or dispose of it if I don’t need it anymore. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s not a perfect system — I often have to remind myself to go through the notebook and dispose of outdated notes. (Also, the Compact size often seems to sell out.) But when I need to quickly jot down a thought, grabbing the Circa from my bag is faster than typing something out on my phone, and a lot more private than recording it. <em>—Barbara Krasnoff, reviews editor</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">About a decade ago, my mother bought me a fauxdori (a knockoff Traveler’s Notebook) for Christmas. At first I didn’t quite get it (I already had more than enough journals and notebooks). But then I discovered that the Traveler’s Notebook wasn’t just a notebook, but a whole system of notebooks — and it’s now indispensable to me. There are a ton of different inserts that you can mix and match to suit your needs, from regular dot-grid notebooks to dated planners, and even thick, accordion-fold paper for watercolor panoramas. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">After some experimenting, I settled on a system that works for me. First, I have a <a href="https://shop.travelerscompanyusa.com/products/travelers-notebook-refill-free-diary-weekly-grid-notebook">Weekly + Memo</a> insert where I can put all my important appointments and dates on the left-hand page, and use the grid on the right-hand page as a habit tracker, to-do list for the week, and a scratchpad for when I need to jot something down. Then I have a <a href="https://shop.travelerscompanyusa.com/products/travelers-notebook-refill-dot-grid">dot-grid</a> journal where I, you know, journal. Rounding out the setup is a <a href="https://shop.travelerscompanyusa.com/products/travelers-notebook-refill-lined-notebook">lined insert</a> that is a sort of commonplace book for me to take notes on things I’m reading and collect ideas for articles or songs. I also have a <a href="https://shop.travelerscompanyusa.com/products/travelers-notebook-refill-sketch-notebook">sketchbook</a> that I add in sometimes when I’m feeling arty, but things get a bit chunky with four inserts. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Maybe you don’t need a separate journal and are content to put a single-sentence recap for each day in your planner. Maybe the memo area isn’t essential and a monthly planner insert will suffice. Or perhaps you want to go all in on scrapbooking and get an insert that’s all brown kraft paper. That’s the beauty of the Traveler’s Notebook: it’s whatever you want it to be. <em>—Terrence O’Brien, weekend editor</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When I decided to try journaling again (with the aforementioned Traveler’s Notebook) I hoped to make the habit stick this time by making it a luxury experience. Scribbling with a Pilot G2 in whatever branded swag notebook I had laying around wasn’t working. So I decided to invest in a fountain pen. There was no need for me to immediately jump to a $200 pen, but I also wanted something nicer than a $3 disposable Zebra Zensations. I quickly settled on a <a href="https://www.lamy.com/en-us/p/lamy-safari-fountain-pen/52925296902478">Lamy Safari</a> (admittedly in part because I found a limited-edition in a gorgeous <a href="https://www.pencilcaseblog.com/2021/04/review-lamy-safari-savannah-terracotta.html">terracotta orange</a>) and haven’t looked back. I’ve tried a few other fountain pens since, but I keep coming back to the reliable and affordable Safari. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">They’re only $30 each, which means you can build a small collection in a variety of colors for pretty cheap. I keep one with my Traveler’s Notebook at all times and one lives in my sling permanently alongside a <a href="https://fieldnotesbrand.com/">Field Notes</a> for when I want to travel light. Then I have a third that just lives on my desk. Basically, I am never without a fine writing instrument, and rarely have to resort to the scratchy collection of free pens that have overtaken an entire drawer in my office. That’s important since, if I actually enjoy writing with a pen, I’m far more likely to use it to take notes, update my to-do list, and journal. It makes those things pleasurable experiences, not just a chore. <em>—Terrence O’Brien, weekend editor</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I get a small burst of dopamine every time I pop the top of my fountain pen and draw ink across a page. As a casual dabbler in fine art, writing with a fountain pen serves as my small way to make something pretty while also working a job that does not pay me to draw. I&#8217;ve tried other pens, like Muji&#8217;s multicolored 0.38 pens, Pigma Micron fine-tipped felt pens, and various gel pens with satisfying clicks. But fountain pens are my daily pleasure.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">My love has not quite turned into an obsession. I use a <a href="https://www.dickblick.com/items/platinum-preppy-fountain-pen-blue-black-medium/?clicktracking=true&amp;wmcp=pla&amp;wmcid=items&amp;wmckw=82159-2091&amp;country=us&amp;currency=usd&amp;srsltid=AfmBOooZJqvS6YAj_bFGwdjy0C8Gp_reYBxz3MFCIwuuL8y2b7H9oRuMC3E">Platinum Preppy fountain pen</a> that costs under $10, and I refill the ink cartridge with Waterman ink using a needle that my friend, who is a nurse, gave to me. But I could see myself expanding this into a hobby by daring to try different color inks and, one day, visiting a nibmeister to get a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmtcTjhJI0A">nib ground</a> to perfectly match the slant of my handwriting. In the meantime, I&#8217;ll enjoy my fairly basic, straightforward fountain pen for what it is: a good way to write a nice line on paper. <em>— Elissa Welle, AI fellow</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I’ve tried digital productivity tools for notes and reminders, but I find I remember things better when I write them by hand. I tend to prefer Japanese-made stationery, and I am <em>very</em> particular about the pens I use. For when a fountain pen feels like overkill, my favorite gel-ink ballpoint pen is Zebra’s Sarasa Clip, which comes in a variety of tip sizes. I like 0.5mm for basic note-taking and journaling and 0.4mm or 0.3mm for finer details, like when I need to write small or attempt to write kanji.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The Sarasa line of pens writes incredibly smoothly and vividly, with a noticeable edge over similar ballpoint pens, like Pilot’s G2 (or, god forbid, a Bic pen). I don’t ever find myself having to scribble on scrap paper to get the Sarasa pens going, which is probably my biggest pet peeve with other pens, and it’s easy to get <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ZEBRA-Refill-0-5mm-Black-Japan/dp/B00VS2YIG6/ref=sr_1_7?crid=2LTHZ810MPI1O&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.ZU6E1esw1N0POS_DlE7sSbrI_-wZKg8-1niKkoj5puYpBc4Eckv1heeBc7xK4lEMt03KEFuO7tlw9HtbbVFzI9ggBez89H73w9ClkFbFa82z0YJESdWK5ci3UPC0FRbJk8LZMQrgW_YtQFkAKhZvcWIX-XZdeqnfyMzgFqWb5HrRuBPNvUuchpvdWJ8Z0S78aeJYvX4teg4R6sHNzDtUPLc2ZJkjvX0ZyHHI3wCkyMGpHbbYgGIATQjeIlvmuDptKBXDji3PgtxpYrRnvSLLsCiCNkPlPCVcmnvvrdJ1vXY.5FxAyFF-JijIZdJmqr6h6WGCU5GQZds4Vw59o7Rvg2c&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=sarasa+pens+refill&amp;qid=1757019404&amp;sprefix=sarasa+pens+refill%2Caps%2C160&amp;sr=8-7">ink refills on Amazon</a>. In my experience, the ink dries quickly on the page, but there’s also the Sarasa Mark On, a smudge- and water-resistant version, for the lefties out there. For day-to-day writing, I simply will not use any other pen. <em>— Kallie Plagge, senior copy editor</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Blackwing One-Step Long Point Sharpener is just such a nice little object. It’s reassuringly weighty while still light enough to carry every day. It has one job: it sharpens pencils beautifully. When the blade gets dull I can order a replacement from Blackwing, and I appreciate a little gadget with a lot of life. You do have to apply a bit of pressure to really get it sharp, and sometimes that creates kind of an indented ring on the pencil wood just above the point. Maybe that’s why people use two-stage sharpeners? I don’t know, I’m new to the luxury pencil game. If so, I think it’s an acceptable tradeoff for one-step sharpening. <em>—Allison Johnson, senior reviewer</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For reasons I have yet to figure out, I have bounced off of every kind of tool, routine, and method out there for jotting down notes that can keep me accountable. Online tools are typically overly complex for me to grasp and easy to forget about, and I&#8217;ve just never taken to a journal or Post-it notes.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Something that&#8217;s working for me is a weekly calendar dry-erase board that&#8217;s in our kitchen. The one we use from Letterfolk has sections for every day of the week (<a href="https://letterfolk.com/collections/home-decor/products/block-compact-monthly-calendar?variant=32172995412034">Letterfolk</a> only makes the monthly version now), plus a sidebar that can be customized to our needs. It also includes magnetized letters and numbers we have to swap out, which is kind of a fun, tactile experience. Whenever my wife and I are feeling overwhelmed, which is frequently, updating the board to reflect what we need can make us feel a little better, whether that&#8217;s sorting out what extra food we need for meals, writing out upcoming appointments, or discussing child care. The board doesn&#8217;t solve every woe in our lives, and updating it can be a chore in and of itself, but it&#8217;s a simple way to make life feel a little more orderly. <em>—Cameron Faulkner, commerce editor</em></p>

AI-focused hardware is all the rage, and Meta arguably already has the best gadgets around in its Ray-Ban and Oakley glasses.

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meta’s next big Connect conference is nearly here, and this year, we’re expecting to see a lot of news about glasses. AI-focused hardware is all the rage, and Meta arguably already has the best gadgets around in its Ray-Ban and Oakley glasses. At this year’s show, we’re expecting to see more about glasses, but also some standalone AI updates and even some talk of the metaverse.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Here’s what we’re expecting from Connect, which will feature a keynote from CEO Mark Zuckerberg that we’ll be covering live on Wednesday at 8PM ET / 5PM PT.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Smart glasses with a display and a wristband</strong></h3>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Meta plans to announce new smart glasses with a small display in the right lens that can be controlled with hand gestures via a wristband, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/22/meta-hypernova-ar-glasses-wristband.html">CNBC reports</a>. The display apparently has a limited field of view and is only intended to show small pieces of information. <em>The Verge</em> reported on the glasses, codenamed Hypernova, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23022611/meta-facebook-nazare-ar-glasses-roadmap-2024">in 2022</a>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The wristband will apparently use surface electromyography (sEMG) technology that “reads and interprets the electrical signals from hand movements,” according to CNBC. The tech comes from CTRL-Labs, a startup Meta acquired <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/23/20881032/facebook-ctrl-labs-acquisition-neural-interface-armband-ar-vr-deal">in 2019</a>, and Meta demoed it last year with its augmented reality Orion glasses. Meta is <em>very</em> optimistic about sEMG technology; in a recent blog post, it said that “sEMG could revolutionize how we interact with our devices” and that sEMG “may just prove to be the perfect input for virtually any device.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The new glasses are expected to cost “about $800,” CNBC says, and could be thicker and heavier than some of Meta’s other smart glasses offerings. And a now-removed video from Meta caught by <em>UploadVR</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/778354/meta-smart-glasses-display-ray-ban-oakley-sphaera-connect">actually showed</a> a pair of new glasses with a display with the branding “Meta | Ray-Ban” and “Display,” so it seems like Meta is on the cusp of actually launching these.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Smart glasses without a display</strong></h3>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Meta’s smart glasses have been a big success — EssilorLuxottica, which produces the Ray-Ban Metas, said that the company has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/613292/meta-ray-ban-2-million-10-million-capacity-subscription-essilor-luxottica-earnings">sold 2 million</a> pairs of the glasses — and rumors indicate that Meta could introduce new models at Connect.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">CNBC reports that Meta plans to announce third-generation Ray-Ban Metas. The timing would make some sense. Meta launched the previous-generation Ray-Bans <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23922425/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">about two years ago</a>, and this year’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech-accessory-review/716360/oakley-meta-hstn-limited-edition-review-smart-glasses-wearables">Oakley Meta HSTN Limited Edition glasses</a> have a better 3K video resolution and double the battery life, so perhaps Meta will bring some of those improvements over to the Ray-Ban line.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The Meta video spotted by <em>UploadVR</em> also showed off a pair of new wraparound “Sphaera” Oakleys with a camera on the nose bridge, so it seems like those could show up at Connect, too.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>New Quest VR headsets? We’ll see</strong></h3>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Meta released the Quest 3 in 2023 and the Quest 3S in 2024, but it doesn’t seem like we should expect a new Quest at Connect this year. According <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/meta-prioritizing-puffin-for-2026-pushing-out-quest-4-to-2027/?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=bluesky">to <em>UploadVR</em></a>, Meta is working on an ultra-light headset that offloads the compute to a puck that runs the company’s Horizon OS, but the headset isn’t scheduled for release until 2026.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Meta <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/22/24137284/meta-license-horizon-os-quest-headset-lenovo-asus">has also</a> started licensing Horizon OS to hardware companies like Lenovo and Asus, and a rumor from earlier this year indicated that Asus is developing a VR headset <a href="https://x.com/Lunayian/status/1878470166360580199">codenamed Tarius</a> with eye tracking and face tracking. Should that headset be real, it could debut at Connect.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The company is promising that Zuckerberg will touch on the metaverse in some way, so we’ll have to wait and see what that actually means.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>More Meta AI</strong></h3>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Meta, like most tech companies, is obsessed with AI right now, so it seems likely the company will tout AI features coming to its apps and hardware. Meta recently relaunched its companion app for its smart glasses as a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/657645/meta-ai-app-chatgpt-competitor-release-ios-android">standalone Meta AI app</a> that lets you browse AI-generated creations posted by other users, and Meta could further build out its social features. The company has also continued to add AI tools to its smart glasses, so in addition to brand-new hardware, existing hardware could get some AI-focused upgrades.</p>
