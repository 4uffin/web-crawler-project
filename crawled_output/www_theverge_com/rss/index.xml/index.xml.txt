Consumer Reports is calling on Microsoft to extend the October 14th deadline that will cut off free security updates for Windows 10 computers.

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Consumer Reports</em> is <a href="https://advocacy.consumerreports.org/research/consumer-reports-calls-on-microsoft-to-extend-support-for-windows-10/">calling on Microsoft</a> to extend the October 14th deadline that will cut off free security updates for Windows 10 computers.

<p class="has-text-align-none">As noted by <em>Consumer Reports</em>, data suggests that around 46.2 percent of people around the world still use Windows 10 as of August 2025, while around 200 to 400 million PCs can’t be upgraded to Windows 11 due to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/4/24312928/microsoft-windows-11-older-hardware-tpm-support">missing hardware requirements</a>.</p>

Microsoft is announcing that it’s investing £22 billion (around $30 billion) in the UK to help support AI infrastructure and ongoing operations from 2025 through 2028. The investment includes $15 billion in capital expenditures to build a supercomputer to support AI demand and adoption. “This will account for more than two-thirds of the tech sector’s [&#8230;]

<p class="has-text-align-none">Microsoft is announcing that it’s <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2025/09/16/microsoft-30-billion-uk-ai-future/">investing £22 billion</a> (around $30 billion) in the UK to help support AI infrastructure and ongoing operations from 2025 through 2028. The investment includes $15 billion in capital expenditures to build a supercomputer to support AI demand and adoption.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“This will account for more than two-thirds of the tech sector’s total investment announcements in the UK that are being made this week,” says Microsoft vice chair and president Brad Smith in a press briefing attended by <em>The Verge</em>. “We’re focused on British pounds, not empty tech promises, because it’s easy to have big numbers, but we’ll be good for every cent of this investment.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Smith is clearly referencing Google’s own investment of £5 billion (around $6.8 billion) that it announced earlier today to help power the UK’s AI efforts. Smith says Microsoft’s latest UK investment is a “very substantial increase” over its <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/11/30/uk-ai-skilling-security-datacenters-investment/">previous investment</a> in 2023.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“This investment will enable us to build the country’s largest supercomputer — with more than 23,000 advanced GPUs — in partnership with Nscale,” says Smith. “We’re not just investing in the UK, we’re investing with partners in the UK. It includes the data centers we have today and an expansion of them.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Microsoft’s multibillion-dollar investments in the UK come on the same day President Donald Trump arrives in Britain for a second state visit, in what’s meant to be seen as a clear collaboration between the US and UK. Smith told reporters that the investment wasn’t requested by the Trump administration, but it’s clearly been well timed on the UK government side.</p>
<div class="youtube-embed"><iframe title="Microsoft invests $30 billion in UK to power AI future" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7LuhWC-AJiM?rel=0" allowfullscreen allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture *; web-share *;"></iframe></div>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The announcement is a big change from Microsoft’s issues with the UK only a few years ago. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/1/23702716/microsoft-activision-blizzard-uk-deal-what-happens-next">Smith openly criticized</a> the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA)&nbsp;during Microsoft’s giant Activision Blizzard acquisition in 2023. Smith said his confidence in the UK had been “severely shaken” after the CMA originally blocked Microsoft’s giant gaming deal, and even said “the European Union is a more attractive place to start a business” than the UK. Smith later <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/2/24022293/microsoft-activision-blizzard-cma-tough-fair-comments-brad-smith">described the regulator</a> as “tough and fair” last year, and said he “might choose slightly different words” to make his point about the CMA.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Smith praised both former Prime Minster Rishi Sunak’s and Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s governments during his briefing with reporters today. “Our ability to make an investment of this size is based in no small measure on the work the government is doing to reform planning, grow electricity capacity, and foster a more stable and open regulatory environment,” says Smith.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Google is also opening a <a href="https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/united-kingdom/waltham-cross-data-centre/">new data center</a> in Waltham Cross, Hertfordshire, that Chancellor <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/16/google-ai-investment-uk-trump-visit-rachel-reeves">Rachel Reeves calls</a> a “powerful vote of confidence in the UK economy and the strength of our partnership with the US.” Microsoft managed to one-up Google and get Starmer to comment on its own investment, and he also called it “a powerful vote of confidence in UK’s leadership in AI and cutting-edge technology.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The other half of Microsoft’s $30 billion investment will be used to support the company’s ongoing operations across the UK, including its 6,000 employees that are based in Britain. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/24/24350954/microsoft-store-london-uk-experience-center-closing">Microsoft did close</a> its 21,000-square-foot store in the heart of London earlier this year, but the company still holds offices at Microsoft Research in Cambridge, the Microsoft UK headquarters in Reading, Microsoft AI in London, and elsewhere.</p>

Waymo is now permitted to test its robotaxi service at San Francisco International Airport (SFO), a big win for the company as it seeks to expand its service area and tackle more popular, revenue-generating destinations.

<p class="has-text-align-none">Waymo is now permitted to test its robotaxi service at San Francisco International Airport (SFO), a big win for the company as it seeks to expand its service area and tackle more popular, revenue-generating destinations. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">After years of back-and-forth negotiations, Waymo signed “Testing and Operations Pilot Permit” with SFO, <a href="https://www.sf.gov/news-mayor-lurie-takes-key-step-toward-launching-waymo-at-sfo">San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie said in a release</a>. Under the agreement, Waymo will roll out its service to SFO in three phases, including testing vehicles with a human driver, testing without a driver, and eventually beginning commercial service. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Waymo will start its tests with employees before eventually inviting members of the public to take trips to and from the airport. Pickups and dropoffs will initially take place at SFO’s Kiss &amp; Fly lot, which is accessible to the terminals via the AirTrain. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Waymo operates in five cities, but currently only serves one airport: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/27/24229789/robots-go-to-the-airport">Phoenix’s Sky Harbor</a>. The company has been locked in negotiations with SFO for several years as it seeks to assure regulators that its vehicles can handle their chaotic environments, with thousands of cars, taxis, shuttles, and passengers constantly intermixing everyday. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But airports represent a huge money-making opportunity for robotaxis, with airport trips accounting for an estimated 20 percent of human-driven ridehail car trips. Waymo will need airport access if it hopes to eventually compete with Uber and Lyft — to say nothing of earning enough money to make a profit. </p>

Wyze has announced its first smart door lock that can be opened by simply hovering your open hand over it. The Wyze Palm Lock is launching today for $129.98 making it more affordable than similar palm-scanning smart locks including the $359.99 Philips Smart Deadbolt that launched last year.

<p class="has-text-align-none">Wyze has <a href="https://www.wyze.com/products/wyze-palm-lock">announced its first smart door lock</a> that can be opened by simply hovering your open hand over it.

But your palm isn’t the only way to unlock it. If it’s the dead of winter and you’re wearing gloves the Palm Lock can also be opened using a physical key, by punching in a code, or using Wyze’s mobile app.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s not as cheap as Wyze’s $80 Wyze Lock Bolt that we called the “Best budget smart(ish) lock” in our <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23393163/best-smart-door-lock">buying guide</a>, but the Palm Lock includes more functionality. Battery life is rated at up to six months thanks to the use of low-power millimeter wave radar that only wakes the lock when a person is detected nearby. Its primary battery can be removed so you can recharge it indoors, while a smaller secondary battery will keep the lock powered for up to two weeks. Should both batteries die, an external power source can be temporarily connected to a USB-C port allowing it to be unlocked using an access code.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Palm vein recognition has been <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214785320366256">shown to be a more secure and accurate</a> method of biometric security than fingerprint readers, and simply waving your hand over an infrared sensor requires less precision than scanning a fingerprint. The Wyze Palm Lock can store palm vein IDs for up to 50 users, and generate up to 50 unique entry codes giving access to people whose palms haven’t been registered.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Wyze’s Palm Lock is Wi-Fi connected so it can also be locked and unlocked from anywhere your phone has internet access or using voice commands through smart assistants like Amazon’s Alexa or Google Assistant. For added security, the lock incorporates a gyroscope that detects the door’s angle and movements. It can be set to automatically lock the door when it senses it’s been closed all the way, or start audibly chirping after a set period of time if it detects the door has been left open.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tesla is under investigation for faulty electronic door handles that can trap people inside their vehicles. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) <a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2025/INOA-PE25010-18817.pdf">launched the probe</a>, saying it was responding to numerous complaints filed by Tesla owners, with a particular focus on children who have been locked inside the vehicle without any way to get out. The news comes a few days after <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2025-tesla-dangerous-doors/"><em>Bloomberg</em> published a bombshell report</a> about Tesla owners who have been seriously injured after becoming trapped in their vehicles after crashes. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Tesla’s door handles, which operate electronically and sit flush against the vehicle for improved aerodynamics, have been the source of some consternation for some time. China’s government is considering banning electronic door handles for safety reasons. And now NHTSA says it is investigating instances in which Tesla’s handles become inoperable as a result of low-voltage battery problems. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The investigation specifically focuses on an estimated 174,290 Model Y SUVs, though the regulator said the investigation could widen:</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none">This investigation will also assess the approach used by Tesla to supply power to the door locks and the reliability of the applicable power supplies. At this time, NHTSA’s investigation is focused on the operability of the electronic door locks from outside of the vehicle as that circumstance is the only one in which<br>there is no manual way to open the door. The agency will continue to monitor any reports of entrapment involving opening doors from inside of the vehicle, and [Office of Defects Investigation] will take further action as needed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="has-text-align-none">NHTSA says its investigation was prompted by nine instances of children becoming trapped inside a Tesla vehicle as a result of low-voltage battery problems. Typically, parents were unable to reopen their Tesla’s doors to retrieve their children from the backseat. Tesla’s vehicles contain manual door releases, but the agency notes that certain people, especially children, may not be able to operate them. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Google is testing a new search app for Windows. <span>A<a href="https://blog.google/products/search/google-app-windows-labs/" target="_blank">&nbsp;blog post on Tuesday</a></span> said the app, currently available on personal accounts <a href="https://labs.google.com/search/experiment/40">via Google’s Search Labs</a>, will allow you to use an <strong>Alt </strong>+<strong> Space</strong> shortcut to search for information from the files on your computer, in your Drive, and on the web.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The app, which has a Chrome-like install process and requires you to sign in, also comes with Google’s visual search feature, Lens, built in. That means you can select and search for images on your screen, as well as translate text. In one example shared by Google, you can highlight a math problem on your homework and then ask Google’s AI Mode to help you find the answer.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Just like Google’s search engine on the web, you can switch between all results, AI Mode, Images, Shopping, and Videos, and more, as well as choose between dark and light mode. It’s similar to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/apple-mac-os/777936/apple-macos-tahoe-26-final-release-testing-impressions-liquid-glass">the Spotlight on Mac</a>, which can help you search through your files, apps, and the web. Windows has long had a built-in feature that lets you search through your files and the web, but it recently upgraded this capability with the launch of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/656106/microsoft-recall-copilot-plus-pc-available">Copilot Plus PCs</a>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Upon downloading the app, Google will plant a search bar directly on your desktop that you can drag anywhere on your screen and resize. You can minimize the search bar by hitting <strong>Alt </strong>+ <strong>Space</strong>. The app also gives you the option to enable or disable AI Mode, as well as change the shortcut used to open the app by selecting your profile picture and hitting <strong>Configurations</strong><em>.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You can try out Google’s new app for Windows now by <a href="https://labs.google.com/search/experiment/40">enabling the experiment in Labs</a>. It’s currently only available in English and for users in the US. You’ll need a PC with Windows 10 or up to download it.</p>
