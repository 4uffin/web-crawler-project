He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.iRacing, known for its simulation racing game for PC, has acquired the rights from Motorsport Games to make a NASCAR racing sim for consoles, according to a Thursday press release. NASCAR and iRacing already work together on virtual races within iRacing that have “thousands of people participating daily,” the press release says, and now they’ll partner up for a NASCAR game for PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and Steam that’s expected to come out in 2025.“Having the ability to build a NASCAR console game is a privilege we promise to execute with the utmost care,” iRacing president Tony Gardner said in a statement. “We look forward to working diligently with NASCAR industry stakeholders to deliver a product that provides an amazing experience for the gaming community and NASCAR fans worldwide.”Image: iRacing and NASCARAn iRacing-made console game seemed like a pretty likely possibility after the company announced last year that it had acquired Monster Games, which worked on the first four NASCAR Heat titles. At the time, iRacing said the acquisition would “bring another level of expertise under the iRacing roof and further the company’s ability to bring the highest quality racing games to the broader market, including the console space.”iRacing founder Dave Kaemmer was also the co-founder of Papyrus Design Group, the maker of many legendary racing simulators, including its final game, NASCAR Racing 2003 Season, which contributed some of the source code that makes up iRacing.Motorsport Games will continue to support its NASCAR games through 2024.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Jay PetersCloseJay PetersSenior ReporterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Jay PetersEntertainmentCloseEntertainmentPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All EntertainmentGamingCloseGamingPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GamingNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMost PopularMost PopularI regret to inform you Meta’s new smart glasses are the best I’ve ever triedVideoHere’s the Jimmy Kimmel clip that got him pulled off the airMeta Connect 2025: the 6 biggest announcementsSamsung brings ads to US fridgesYes, Jimmy Kimmel’s suspension was government censorshipThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
