Jess started her career at TechRadar, covering news and hardware reviews.The European Union has outlined exactly how Apple needs to improve the interoperability of iOS, and the guidance reveals which features could be available to other smartwatches, headphones, and speakers.The specifications adopted by the European Commission on Tuesday explain exactly how Apple needs to open iPhone and iPad operating systems to comply with the bloc’s Digital Markets Act (DMA) law, and involves two sets of different measures. One is focused on improving the application process for developers who request interoperability with Apple’s ecosystem. The other is more exciting for iPhone and iPad users, as it specifically outlines nine iOS-exclusive connectivity features that Apple needs to make available for other platforms to use — the vast majority of which need to be opened up “by the end of 2025 at the latest,” according to the EU ruling.One of the standouts is opening access to iOS notifications, which will finally allow third-party smartwatches to display and interact with them in a manner currently only available on Apple Watch devices. A feature that allows apps to run in the background without interruption will also enable third-party devices to more reliably collect information like news and weather updates from connected iPhones.Features like SharePlay and audio-switching capabilities that allow Apple headphones to automatically jump between different devices (switching from playing music on an iPad to receiving an incoming call on iPhones, for example) must be made available on third-party earphones and headsets, sparing iPhone users from needing to buy AirPods. Apple also needs to let devices use the same high-bandwidth iPhone connections currently only available on Apple hardware, which could improve connectivity on third-party VR headsets.Other platforms will also be able to send and receive data via AirDrop and AirPlay when connected with an Apple device, and iOS will need to support alternative services to both AirDrop and AirPlay. Additional improvements expected for third-party devices include making them easier for iPhone users to set up without downloading a companion app, automatically connecting to Wi-Fi networks via iPhones, and easily receiving contactless payment credentials via NFC transfer.These requirements are legally binding and must be applied for Apple to meet its DMA obligations. Apple risks facing a non-compliance investigation that could eventually result in hefty fines of up to ten percent of Apple’s annual turnover if the EU finds Apple violating DMA rules by not implementing the guidance by its deadlines.Apple has the opportunity to fight the decisions, subject to judicial review. Such opposition seems likely, given Apple said in a statement to The Verge that the EU’s requirements are “bad for our products and for our European users.” The EU seems confident that its ruling will force the company to open up its walled iOS garden for other platform developers, however.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Jess WeatherbedCloseJess WeatherbedNews ReporterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Jess WeatherbedAppleCloseApplePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All AppleiOSCloseiOSPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All iOSNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsPolicyClosePolicyPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All PolicyPoliticsClosePoliticsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All PoliticsRegulationCloseRegulationPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All RegulationTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMost PopularMost PopularApple’s new iPhone charger is a (second) of its kindMicrosoft is changing how Xbox controllers work on Windows 11Spotify Lossless is an inconvenient improvementiOS 26 with Apple’s Liquid Glass redesign is out nowAirPods Pro 3 review: tripling down on a good thingThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
