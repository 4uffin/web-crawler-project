Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.Warner Bros. Discovery is suing Midjourney over claims the AI startup “brazenly dispenses its intellectual property as if it were its own,” as reported earlier by The Hollywood Reporter. In the lawsuit, Warner Bros. Discovery alleges that Midjourney generated “countless” infringing images and videos of its copyrighted characters, including Superman, Bugs Bunny, Scooby-Doo, and more.Warner Bros. Discovery accuses Midjourney of reproducing, displaying, and distributing “unauthorized derivatives” of its intellectual property through its AI image and video generation tools. Throughout the lawsuit, Warner Bros. Discovery shares several examples of how Midjourney’s AI tools seem to have generated images of copyrighted characters, like Wonder Woman, Tweety, the Power Puff Girls, and even Rick and Morty in response to prompts asking to see the characters in certain situations.Image: Warner Bros. DiscoveryAdditionally, Warner Bros. Discover claims that Midjourney will generate infringing images even if prompts don’t mention a specific character. For instance, Midjourney allegedly generated downloadable images of Superman, Batman, and Flash after receiving the prompt, “classic comic book superhero battle.” Midjourney is facing a similar copyright lawsuit from Disney and Universal, which called the company’s AI image generator a “virtual vending machine” that generates “endless authorized copies” of their work.Midjourney allegedly generated these images in response to a prompt that asks for a “classic comic book superhero battle.” Image: Warner Bros. Discovery via MidjourneyWarner Bros. Discovery claims Midjourney is aware of the “breathtaking scope of its piracy and copyright infringement” but refuses to protect copyright holders.“It is hard to imagine copyright infringement that is any more willful than what Midjourney is doing here,” the lawsuit states. “Midjourney is purposefully exploiting Warner Bros. Discovery’s valuable intellectual property to attract subscribers to Midjourney, and it is profiting by providing subscribers with endless copies and derivatives of Warner Bros. Discovery’s Copyrighted Works.”Image: Warner Bros. DiscoveryWarner Bros. Discovery is suing Midjourney for damages related to the alleged copyright infringement, and is asking the court to block Midjourney from copying, displaying, or distributing its intellectual property, as well as to stop the company from offering AI tools without copyright protection measures. Midjourney didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Emma RothCloseEmma RothNews WriterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Emma RothAICloseAIPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All AICopyrightCloseCopyrightPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All CopyrightEntertainmentCloseEntertainmentPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All EntertainmentFilmCloseFilmPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All FilmLawCloseLawPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All LawNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsPolicyClosePolicyPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All PolicyTV ShowsCloseTV ShowsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TV ShowsMost PopularMost PopularI regret to inform you Meta’s new smart glasses are the best I’ve ever triedVideoHere’s the Jimmy Kimmel clip that got him pulled off the airMeta Connect 2025: the 6 biggest announcementsJimmy Kimmel Live pulled ‘indefinitely’ for joke about Charlie Kirk’s killer after FCC threatSamsung brings ads to US fridgesThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
