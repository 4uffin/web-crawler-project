Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories.A new Pokémon spinoff is on the way, and it looks very different than any other entry in the long-running franchise. In fact, it looks a little bit like Minecraft — and it’s called Pokémon Pokopia.The game has players controlling a Ditto that has taken on the form of a human, which means that it’s a little cute and also a little creepy. The goal of the game is to shape an empty landscape into a suitable home for some pokémon. That means taming the wilderness, growing crops, and also using a bunch of classic pokémon moves to make it all happen. The visuals look like a mix of the structured form of a Minecraft game with the cutesy characters and tone of Pokémon. Given those are two of the biggest franchises in gaming, it sounds — on paper at least — like a winning mix.Pokopia is launching on the Nintendo Switch some time in 2026.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Andrew WebsterCloseAndrew WebsterSenior entertainment editorPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Andrew WebsterEntertainmentCloseEntertainmentPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All EntertainmentGamingCloseGamingPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GamingNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsNintendoCloseNintendoPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NintendoPokemonClosePokemonPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All PokemonMore in this streamSee allFight for glory in Fire Emblem: Fortune’s Weave coming to the Switch 2 next yearAsh ParrishSep 12Pokémon Legends: Z-A’s first DLC will take you to the Mega DimensionCharles Pulliam-MooreSep 12Go even more bananas.Andrew WebsterSep 12Most PopularMost PopularApple iPhone Air review: statement pieceVideoRepublicans are honoring Charlie Kirk’s memory by declaring war on the First AmendmentThe iPhone 17 is the one to get this yearHere’s the Jimmy Kimmel clip that got him pulled off the airApple’s iPhone 17 Pro is a bold redesign but a basic upgradeThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
