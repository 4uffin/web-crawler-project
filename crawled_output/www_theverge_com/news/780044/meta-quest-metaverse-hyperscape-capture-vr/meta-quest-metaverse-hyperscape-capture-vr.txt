He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.Meta is rolling out tech that lets you capture a real-world space with a Quest VR headset so you can create a digital, photorealistic VR replica. The company calls the tech “Hyperscape,” and as part of a gradual rollout beginning today, users will be able to use the beta Hyperscape Capture app with their Quest 3 or Quest 3S to make the virtual copies. Initially, you’ll only be able to visit the rooms you’ve scanned by yourself, but Meta says that users will be able to visit rooms together by sharing a private link sometime “soon.”Meta showed off Hyperscape as part of a demo introduced at Connect 2024 last year, and while it seems like the tech is still somewhat early, it’s clear that the company sees virtual recreations of real environments as a potentially notable use case for VR and its metaverse ambitions. (Though those ambitions have seemingly taken a back seat to AI as of late.) You can see a Meta-provided example of Hyperscape in the GIF below that recreates Gordon Ramsay’s home kitchen.Kitchen goals. GIF: MetaI toured some prescanned rooms at Connect 2025, including Ramsay’s kitchen. The rooms looked a lot like real-life rooms, and it was fun to get up close to details like food on a table or a stack of books. The illusion would break down if you got too close to things — text on a “paper” New York Times was readable, but sometimes a little smudgy — but overall, I was really impressed with the scans.RelatedThe tech to build the holodeckI also tried a brief demo of the capture app. Wearing a Quest 3 headset, I walked and looked around a room, and as I did, a virtual mesh started to appear over objects I was facing. After about a three-minute scan of the room, the app prompted me to move closer to objects. That made the mesh start to disappear, which was a clever way to show what I had “scanned” in detail. But I didn’t get to finish that part before a Meta rep ended the demo.Meta says that after you complete a full scan, it’s uploaded to the cloud to process over the course of a few hours before you can experience the scan for yourself.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Jay PetersCloseJay PetersSenior ReporterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Jay PetersGadgetsCloseGadgetsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GadgetsMetaCloseMetaPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All MetaNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechWearableCloseWearablePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All WearableMore in this streamSee allI know why Mark Zuckerberg risked live demo failureSean HollisterSep 19Meta is opening up its smart glasses to developersJay PetersSep 18A native Discord app is coming to Quest VR headsets.Jay PetersSep 18Most PopularMost PopularAnker’s recent power bank recall involves over 481,000 unitsMeta’s failed smart glasses demos had nothing to do with the Wi-FiNest is dead, long live Google HomeI regret to inform you Meta’s new smart glasses are the best I’ve ever triedVideoYes, Jimmy Kimmel’s suspension was government censorshipThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
