He previously worked at Android Police and Tech Advisor.Google is overdue an update to its smart home setup, and now we know when it’ll come: October 1st. The company has teased some sort of launch or announcement for that day, promising that “Gemini is coming to Google Home.”The company announced Gemini for Home at last month’s Made by Google event, promising early access would begin in October, so a dedicated event with more details before things kick off makes sense. Google’s AI assistant will eventually replace Google Assistant across the smart home, theoretically enabling natural language interactions and more intuitive controls.We’re not only expecting an assistant announcement. Google’s teaser includes a glimpse of a Nest Cam, and while it looks the spitting image of existing hardware, we expect it’s a new model, rumored to launch soon alongside a new Nest Doorbell, both featuring 2K camera support. There’s also the small matter of the unknown Nest speaker glimpsed during the recent launch stream, which we expect to be at the center of Google’s new home hardware.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Dominic PrestonCloseDominic PrestonNews EditorPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Dominic PrestonGoogleCloseGooglePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GoogleNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsSmart HomeCloseSmart HomePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All Smart HomeTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMost PopularMost PopularI regret to inform you Meta’s new smart glasses are the best I’ve ever triedVideoHere’s the Jimmy Kimmel clip that got him pulled off the airMeta Connect 2025: the 6 biggest announcementsSamsung brings ads to US fridgesYes, Jimmy Kimmel’s suspension was government censorshipThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
