Jess started her career at TechRadar, covering news and hardware reviews.Qualcomm has announced that its upcoming flagship mobile chipset is the “Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5,” a confusingly named successor to the Snapdragon 8 Elite. While the processor itself will be unveiled during the Snapdragon Summit on September 23rd-25th, Qualcomm has already published an explanation for the branding update.“It might look like we skipped generations, but the truth is simpler— and more powerful. Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 marks the fifth generation of our premium 8-series platforms since we introduced our new single-digit naming and visual identity, ” Qualcomm said in a blog post. “So, while the naming may look new, it’s actually a continuation of our established framework.”This move aims to make the generational Snapdragon mobile chip lineup easier for consumers to understand. After releasing the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, Gen 2, and Gen 3, Qualcomm broke its naming conventions with last year’s Snapdragon 8 Elite, which is technically the fourth generation of the Snapdragon 8-series. Reintroducing generation numbers will help to make it clearer that these products all exist within the same family and release timeline, while (perhaps not coincidentally) avoiding the number four — which is considered to be unlucky in Chinese culture.To Qualcomm’s credit, this is less confusing than the numerical branding it previously used for its Snapdragon mobile chips, but it’s amusing that it still had to justify the switch to people who were expecting this to be called the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 2.The Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 is poised to rival Apple’s new A19 Pro chipset, and is expected to power the next generation of flagship Android phones, such as Samsung’s Galaxy S26 series and the OnePlus 15.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Jess WeatherbedCloseJess WeatherbedNews ReporterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Jess WeatherbedAndroidCloseAndroidPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All AndroidGoogleCloseGooglePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GoogleNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMost PopularMost PopularApple’s new iPhone charger is a (second) of its kindSpotify Lossless is an inconvenient improvementMicrosoft is changing how Xbox controllers work on Windows 11AirPods Pro 3 review: tripling down on a good thingiOS 26 with Apple’s Liquid Glass redesign is out nowThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
