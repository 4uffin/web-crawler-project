Jess started her career at TechRadar, covering news and hardware reviews.Tesla is redesigning the electronic door handles that are currently under investigation for trapping people inside their vehicles. In an Interview with Bloomberg, Tesla design chief Franz von Holzhausen said that the company is looking to make the handles more intuitive for occupants in “a panic situation.”The update will involve combining the electronic and manual door-release mechanisms into one button, replacing the current design, which has them in separate locations. These changes are likely being made in response to a safety probe launched by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) this week, following reports from Tesla owners being unable to open their doors from the outside using the inoperative handles — which sit flush against the vehicle — to remove their children.Tesla is also monitoring for potential changes in Chinese regulations as the country considers implementing a ban on fully concealed door handles. “We’ll have a really good solution for that,” von Holzhausen told Bloomberg.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Jess WeatherbedCloseJess WeatherbedNews ReporterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Jess WeatherbedElectric CarsCloseElectric CarsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All Electric CarsNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsTeslaCloseTeslaPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TeslaTransportationCloseTransportationPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TransportationMost PopularMost PopularI regret to inform you Meta’s new smart glasses are the best I’ve ever triedVideoHere’s the Jimmy Kimmel clip that got him pulled off the airMeta Connect 2025: the 6 biggest announcementsSamsung brings ads to US fridgesYes, Jimmy Kimmel’s suspension was government censorshipThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
