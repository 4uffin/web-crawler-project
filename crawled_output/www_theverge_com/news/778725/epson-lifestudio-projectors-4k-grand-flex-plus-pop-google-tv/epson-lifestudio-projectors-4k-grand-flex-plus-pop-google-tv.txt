The lineup includes portable projectors and an ultra-short throw model designed to be part of a permanent home theater setup, with a mix of 4K and 1080P options. All five models feature built-in speakers developed as part of a partnership with Bose, Epson’s new 3LCD projection technology, Google TV, and a new mobile app for iOS and Android that can be used to create movies and photo slideshows that stream to the projectors.The Lifestudio Grand UST projector is available now in black or white color options. Image: EpsonThe most expensive model in the new lineup is the $2,699.99 Epson Lifestudio Grand: an ultra-short throw projector that can create a 4K, 120-inch image when positioned just 15.2-inches away from a wall or screen. Weighing over 16 pounds it’s not designed with portability in mind, but with 3,600 lumens of output, it’s Epson’s brightest Lifestudio projector — and the loudest, with a pair of 45mm speakers and an 80mm subwoofer.The Flex Plus projector can be powered over a USB-C connection to a battery, improving its portability. Image: EpsonMore affordable but still capable are the $999.99 Epson Lifestudio Flex Plus and $849.99 Flex projectors, which both include a short flexible tabletop stand for easier positioning and alignment and dual 40mm speakers that work alongside a passive radiator to boost lower frequencies.The Flex Plus is a 4K model with 1,000 lumens of illumination and ambient lighting so it can double as a (very expensive) lamp. It can be powered through a USB-C port using an adapter or a battery with at least 100W of output. If you go the battery route to improve its portability, Epson says a 24,000mAh power bank will provide up to 70 minutes of movie watching. The more affordable Lifestudio Flex is limited to 1080P and 700 lumens of brightness, but can’t be powered over USB-C.The Pop Plus (pictured) is available in navy or black color options while the cheaper Pop is only available in white. Image: EpsonThe $679.99 Pop and $799.99 Pop Plus are the most budget-friendly options in Epson’s new Lifestudio lineup, offering 1080P and 4K resolutions respectively; both have the same 700 lumens of brightness. Sound is delivered through a 20mm tweeter and a 40mm full range speaker, while bass frequencies are boosted using a pair of passive radiators.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Andrew LiszewskiCloseAndrew LiszewskiSenior Reporter, NewsPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Andrew LiszewskiGadgetsCloseGadgetsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GadgetsNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsMost PopularMost PopularI regret to inform you Meta’s new smart glasses are the best I’ve ever triedVideoHere’s the Jimmy Kimmel clip that got him pulled off the airMeta Connect 2025: the 6 biggest announcementsJimmy Kimmel Live pulled ‘indefinitely’ for joke about Charlie Kirk’s killer after FCC threatSamsung brings ads to US fridgesThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
