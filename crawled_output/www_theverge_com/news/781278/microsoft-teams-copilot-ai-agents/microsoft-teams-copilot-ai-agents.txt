He previously worked at Android Police and Tech Advisor.Microsoft is adding a whole load of AI agents to Teams today, promising Copilot assistants for every channel, meeting, and community. The new agents will also work across SharePoint and Viva Engage, and are rolling out for Microsoft 365 Copilot users.Facilitator agents will now sit in on Teams meetings, creating agendas, taking notes, and answering questions. Agents can also suggest time allotments for different meeting topics — letting participants know if they’re running over — and create documents and tasks. A mobile version is designed to be activated “with a single tap” so you can make sure the agent doesn’t miss out on “a quick hallway chat or a spontaneous in-person sync.”Channel agents are designed to answer questions based on a channel’s previous conversations and meetings and can also generate status reports for a project the same way. There are also community agents inside Viva Engage, Microsoft’s take on company-wide social networks, which work similarly but mostly serve to support community admins, answering questions from other users. Knowledge agents run in SharePoint behind the scenes, organizing, tagging, and summarizing files.Facilitator agents are available now, though their ability to create documents and tasks is in public preview, as are the other newly announced agents. They’re joined in preview by a redesigned Workflows tool to create AI automations of tasks, and a tool to generate audio recaps based on meeting notes.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Dominic PrestonCloseDominic PrestonNews EditorPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Dominic PrestonAICloseAIPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All AIMicrosoftCloseMicrosoftPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All MicrosoftNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMost PopularMost PopularI regret to inform you Meta’s new smart glasses are the best I’ve ever triedVideoHere’s the Jimmy Kimmel clip that got him pulled off the airMeta Connect 2025: the 6 biggest announcementsSamsung brings ads to US fridgesYes, Jimmy Kimmel’s suspension was government censorshipThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
