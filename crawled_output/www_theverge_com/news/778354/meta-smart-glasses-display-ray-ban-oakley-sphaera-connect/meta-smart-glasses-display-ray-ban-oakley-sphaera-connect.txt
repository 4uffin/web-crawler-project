He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.An unlisted and now-removed video from Meta showed off a new pair of Ray-Ban branded smart glasses with a display and a wristband to help control them, as reported by UploadVR. The video also features a new pair of wraparound “Sphaera” Oakley smart glasses with a camera on the nose, meaning that Meta itself may have inadvertently leaked two of its biggest announcements from its Connect event this week.For the glasses with a display, the video includes branding that says “Meta | Ray-Ban” and “Display,” so perhaps Meta will call them the Meta Ray-Ban Display. Based on a brief clip included in UploadVR’s article, the actual display is in the right lens of the glasses, and the clip shows how the glasses will let you do things like ask Meta AI a question, look at a map on the glasses to help you navigate, translate a sign, or use your hand with the wristband to “write” a reply to a chat.Earlier this year, CNBC reported that the wristband for Meta’s codenamed “Hypernova” glasses with a display would use surface electromyography (sEMG) technology to interpret signals from hand movements to help you control the device, so the clip is presumably showing that tech in action.The Sphaera glasses.Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg will be hosting a Connect keynote at 8PM ET on Wednesday, where it seems like these new glasses will make their official debut. The Verge will be covering the keynote live.Correction, September 15th: An earlier version of this article speculated about translucent versions of the HSTN Oakley glasses, but those are already on sale.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Jay PetersCloseJay PetersSenior ReporterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Jay PetersGadgetsCloseGadgetsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GadgetsMetaCloseMetaPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All MetaNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechWearableCloseWearablePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All WearableMost PopularMost PopularApple’s new iPhone charger is a (second) of its kindThe unbearable sameness of Liquid GlassiOS 26 with Apple’s Liquid Glass redesign is out nowMicrosoft is changing how Xbox controllers work on Windows 11Meta leaks its new smart glasses with a displayThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
