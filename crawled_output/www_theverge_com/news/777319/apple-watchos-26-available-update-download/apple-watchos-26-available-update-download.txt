For those who have been holding off on testing the developer and public betas, Apple has finally released watchOS 26 to the masses and the update is available for several different iterations of the Apple Watch including the Series 6 to the new Series 11, the second and third-generation Apple Watch SE, and all of the extra-durable Ultra models.Apple’s new Liquid Glass design language is subtler on the Apple Watch. Image: AppleOne of the biggest changes coming to all of Apple’s operating systems is the company’s new Liquid Glass design language that updates windows, notifications, app icons, and other UI elements with a transparent glassy appearance revealing what’s beneath them. For the Apple Watch, the Liquid Glass update isn’t quite as dramatic a change as it is for the iPhone and iOS 26. You’ll mostly notice a new glossy appearance to icons and buttons in the Smart Stack, Control Center, and apps, and with watch faces that mix text and photos.With watchOS 26 you can dismiss timers and notifications by rotating your Apple Watch away from you. Image: AppleA new wrist flick gesture (that looks easier than the previous finger pinch double tap gesture) lets you silence timers, mute calls, and dismiss notifications by rotating your wrist away from you. With watchOS 26 the Apple Watch can also automatically adjust the volume of calls, notifications, and Siri based on ambient noise, making them quieter when the din dies down. And for the first time, Apple’s Notes app will be available on the Apple Watch, including the ability to create new notes or asking Siri to do that for you.Hypertension notifications, announced alongside the Apple Watch Series 11 and Ultra 3 last week, are also coming with watchOS 26. The health feature uses the Apple Watch’s existing optical sensor to collect data about how blood vessels respond to heart beats over a 30 day period to detect signs of high blood pressure and notify users. It will also be available on older Apple Watch models with today’s update including the Series 9 and onward and the Ultra 2 and 3.watchOS 26 brings Apple’s Notes app to the Apple Watch and translations to Messages. Image: AppleNew Apple Watch health features being introduced today include a new sleep score that evaluates the quality of your slumber based on your sleep duration, interruptions throughout the night, and how consistent your bedtime is. It joins a new Workout Buddy, powered by Apple Intelligence, that uses your fitness history to provide motivational messages and insights during a workout such as pep talks letting you know how far you are from your activity goal.Other watchOS 26 upgrades include configurable widgets in the Smart Stack so you can prioritize ones you access frequently, automatic message translations using Apple Intelligence, and new watch faces. Supported Apple Watch models will also get access to the iPhone’s Hold Assist and Call Screening features that can ask people why they’re calling or remain on hold on your behalf and send a notification once a live agent is available.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Andrew LiszewskiCloseAndrew LiszewskiSenior Reporter, NewsPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Andrew LiszewskiAppleCloseApplePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All AppleGadgetsCloseGadgetsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GadgetsNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechWearableCloseWearablePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All WearableMost PopularMost PopularThe unbearable sameness of Liquid GlassiOS 26 with Apple’s Liquid Glass redesign is out nowApple’s new iPhone charger is a (second) of its kindMeta leaks its new smart glasses with a displayI’ve been using macOS Tahoe 26 since June and here are the eight best things about itThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
