He joined in 2018, and after a stint at Polygon, he rejoined The Verge in May 2025.Logitech has announced the Astro A20 X wireless gaming headset, which has a feature that console players might appreciate having: it lets you swap between audio from two platforms, be it an Xbox, Switch, PC, or PS5. It launches October 8th for $179.99.The A20 X ships with a transmitter called the Playsync Base that can receive audio inputs via USB from two platforms. When you press the button on the back of the headset’s right ear cup, a subtle LED light on the transmitter will jump between sources, lit to indicate where your audio is currently coming from.The execution here isn’t too different from what I’ve seen in other — typically pricier — gaming headsets, namely some of Astro’s own. The $399 A50 X and $299 A50 Gen 5 both allow easy audio switching for two consoles (the A50 X also includes video switching via two HDMI-in ports), as do SteelSeries’ $300-ish Arctis Nova Pro Wireless and its $180-ish wired counterpart. All of these solutions make it so you don’t have to leave your chair to swap audio sources. This one just so happens to be the most affordable wireless option that I’ve seen that supports Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC in one model, even if $179.99 still isn’t cheap.The A20 X has other hardware staples we expect to see, like a dedicated two-button rocker for adjusting the game and chat audio (it’s on the opposite ear cup from the volume rocker, so as to avoid confusion). It has a flexible, detachable boom microphone, a mute button, and Bluetooth 5.3 compatibility with phones and other mobile devices. However, its Bluetooth support doesn’t include concurrent wireless connections; it’s one or the other.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Cameron FaulknerCloseCameron FaulknerEditor, CommercePosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Cameron FaulknerGamingCloseGamingPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GamingLogitechCloseLogitechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All LogitechNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsNintendoCloseNintendoPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NintendoPC GamingClosePC GamingPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All PC GamingPlayStationClosePlayStationPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All PlayStationTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechXboxCloseXboxPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All XboxMost PopularMost PopularI regret to inform you Meta’s new smart glasses are the best I’ve ever triedVideoHere’s the Jimmy Kimmel clip that got him pulled off the airMeta Connect 2025: the 6 biggest announcementsSamsung brings ads to US fridgesJimmy Kimmel Live pulled ‘indefinitely’ for joke about Charlie Kirk’s killer after FCC threatThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
