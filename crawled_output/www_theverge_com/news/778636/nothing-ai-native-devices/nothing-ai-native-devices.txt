Previously, he wrote about health, science and tech for Forbes.London-based consumer tech startup Nothing has raised $200 million and vowed to usher in a new generation of “AI-native” devices running on operating systems that “are significantly different from the ones today.”In a press release that reads part ode to technology and part manifesto, Nothing founder and CEO Carl Pei said the cash infusion — which values Nothing at $1.3 billion — will help the company ramp up distribution and accelerate innovation.At the heart of Nothing’s plans is AI. Pei said the company is “building the foundations for the future” on a focused “AI OS” to deliver a “hyper-personalized experience.” However, it’s unclear if Nothing’s operating system ambitions are built on top of Android like Nothing OS. We’ve reached out for clarification.This “AI-native platform” will run hardware in widespread use today like smartphones, headphones, and smart watches, Pei said, as well as other devices like smart glasses, electric vehicles, and humanoid robots. He confidently predicts Nothing’s new OS will run “whatever comes next,” too. That said, last October Pei just as confidently proclaimed that “AI is just a tool” and that the company’s OS should not be described as an AI operating system.Nothing plans to release its first AI-native devices next year. Its chief challenge will be generating demand in a category that has historically failed to engage the mass market and where success has eluded even the industry’s biggest players like Apple. There’s no shortage of competitors either, including the mysterious “screen free” device former Apple designer Jony Ive is creating with OpenAI.Nothing says it’s uniquely positioned to create these future AI devices. “Owning the last-mile distribution point with all its contextual and user knowledge is essential to developing an OS that will help people in their daily lives,” said Pei. “An AI OS that doesn’t know its user and isn’t ever-present can’t deliver a hyper-personalised experience. This is the next chapter for Nothing, integrating an AI experience into our hardware devices to reinvent how technology amplifies us.”0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Robert HartCloseRobert HartAI ReporterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Robert HartAICloseAIPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All AIGadgetsCloseGadgetsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GadgetsNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMost PopularMost PopularI regret to inform you Meta’s new smart glasses are the best I’ve ever triedVideoHere’s the Jimmy Kimmel clip that got him pulled off the airMeta Connect 2025: the 6 biggest announcementsJimmy Kimmel Live pulled ‘indefinitely’ for joke about Charlie Kirk’s killer after FCC threatSamsung brings ads to US fridgesThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
