This will be the last major macOS update for older Intel-based Macs – specifically those featuring Apple’s T2 Security Chip.Various UI elements on Tahoe will have a glossy transparent appearance, revealing what’s beneath them. Image: AppleThe most notable update with Tahoe will also be its most obvious. It includes a major UI overhaul based on Apple’s new Liquid Glass design language that will feature an extensive use of transparent effects on windows, buttons, and notifications. Tahoe’s menu bar will also be completely transparent, making displays seem a bit larger.RelatedApple’s Liquid Glass redesign is shaping up to be a snoozer on MacsmacOS’ Spotlight search tool and launcher will be more useful with Tahoe, ranking search results intelligently based on relevance and allowing users to perform specific actions with apps like sending an email or creating a note without having to actually open those specific apps. If you like to keep your Mac immaculately organized you can now change the colors of folders or add an emoji to make them stand out.The new Phone app can route calls from your iPhone to your desktop so you don’t need to reach for your smartphone to answer them. Image: AppleA new Phone app will mirror the functionality of the one on iOS and can relay calls from your iPhone through your computer. It will include access to recents and voicemails, as well as new iOS features like Call Screening that can answer calls from unknown numbers for you and Hold Assist that can stay on the line until a real person responds. Leveraging Apple Intelligence, Live Translation can translate text, audio during phone calls or FaceTime calls, and even chats in Messages.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Andrew LiszewskiCloseAndrew LiszewskiSenior Reporter, NewsPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Andrew LiszewskiAppleCloseApplePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All ApplemacOSClosemacOSPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All macOSNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMost PopularMost PopularThe unbearable sameness of Liquid GlassiOS 26 with Apple’s Liquid Glass redesign is out nowApple’s new iPhone charger is a (second) of its kindMeta leaks its new smart glasses with a displayI’ve been using macOS Tahoe 26 since June and here are the eight best things about itThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
