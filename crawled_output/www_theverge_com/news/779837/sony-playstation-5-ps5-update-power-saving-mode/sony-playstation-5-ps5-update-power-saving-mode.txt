Jess started her career at TechRadar, covering news and hardware reviews.PS5 users can now run select games in “Power Saving” mode and pair DualSense controllers with multiple devices. Sony started beta testing these features in July, but they’re now rolling out to everyone today in the version 25.06-12.00.00 console software update.The new Power Saver mode will reduce the power consumption of PS5 consoles in exchange for scaling back game performance, according to Sony’s PS5 update notes, which could come in handy for the company’s rumored PlayStation handheld. Power Saving mode can be toggled on or off for supported games by heading into Settings > System > Power Saving > Use Power Saver. When enabled, an icon will appear next to the supported game in Switcher or the control center, according to Sony.The software for DualSense and DualSense Edge wireless controllers has also been updated to make it easier to switch them across connected devices. Controllers can now be paired with up to four devices simultaneously, preventing users from having to go through the cumbersome process of manually reconnecting the controller when switching between consoles, PCs, and cloud streaming devices.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Jess WeatherbedCloseJess WeatherbedNews ReporterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Jess WeatherbedGamingCloseGamingPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GamingNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsPlayStationClosePlayStationPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All PlayStationSonyCloseSonyPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All SonyTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMost PopularMost PopularApple iPhone Air review: statement pieceVideoHere’s the Jimmy Kimmel clip that got him pulled off the airI regret to inform you Meta’s new smart glasses are the best I’ve ever triedVideoRepublicans are honoring Charlie Kirk’s memory by declaring war on the First AmendmentThe iPhone 17 is the one to get this yearThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
