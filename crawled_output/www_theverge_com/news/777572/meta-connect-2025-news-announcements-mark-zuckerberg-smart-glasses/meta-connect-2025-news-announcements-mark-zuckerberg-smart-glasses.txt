Jay PetersLinkFacebookThreadsRSSComments0CommentsMeta’s annual Connect conference is happening on September 17th and 18th, and it seems like there’s going to be a lot of focus on smart glasses.CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s Wednesday evening keynote will discuss “the latest on AI glasses,” the company says. Rumors and a video leak from Meta already indicate that we might see Meta launch glasses that have a display on one lens and that are controlled with a neural wristband, as well as wraparound Oakley smart glasses with a camera on the nose bridge.The company also says that Zuckerberg will lay out “Meta’s vision for artificial intelligence and the metaverse,” so there should be some non-smart glasses news to look forward to, too.Zuckerberg’s keynote begins at 8PM ET / 5PM PT, and we’ll be covering the keynote and major announcements from the show live.

In addition to the long-awaited reveal of Meta’s updated Ray-Ban smart glasses, the company had some other exciting surprises to share, too.Here’s a roundup of all the new tech and software updates announced by Meta.Read Article >Today, 12:59 AM UTCJay PetersZuckerberg came back in workout gear, then Diplo showed up, and now they’re going on a run. Show’s over!I have no idea what’s going on.Today, 12:55 AM UTCVictoria Song#SavetheThunderRound.Look, James Cameron is an icon. A treasure. But we need to bring the Thunder Round sound effects from Hot Girl Vergecast Summer in to wrap this up. Kinda wish we got more Meta Ray-Ban Display demos, even if they did fail.Today, 12:45 AM UTCVictoria SongJames Cameron takes the stage.Cameron is here to talk about VR and immersive entertainment, particularly Cameron’s passion for 3D filmmaking. “I’ve spent my filmmaking career really trying to engage people,” he says.Today, 12:42 AM UTCEmma RothMeta is bringing an all-in-one movie and TV streaming hub to Quest headsetsHorizon TV puts your streaming apps in one spot. Image: MetaMeta is making it easier to stream movies and TV shows on your Quest headset. During its Meta Connect keynote on Wednesday, the company announced that it’s rolling out a Horizon TV hub with access to streaming apps like Prime Video, Peacock, Twitch, and — finally — Disney Plus with Hulu and ESPN.The image shared by Meta shows content recommendations and streaming apps lined up on the homepage, along with tabs to switch between movies, TV shows, “immersive” experiences, sports, music, and your watchlist. It’s unclear whether the tabs will show content from all of these platforms, or just the ones you subscribe to.Read Article >Today, 12:41 AM UTCJay PetersZuckerberg is now talking about the VR and metaverse.Including a new “immersive” virtual home. There won’t be an “8-bit Eiffel Tower,” he said, referencing a famous Zuck meme.Today, 12:39 AM UTCJay PetersMeta is making the metaverse look betterImage: MetaMeta is making improvements to its Roblox-like social platform Horizon Worlds, with the biggest upgrades being the introduction of a new game engine with better graphics as well as the Meta Horizon Studio to help creators to make custom in-game experiences.Meta Horizon Studio is an editor that lets creators make VR worlds. Creators can already use generative AI tools to create things like textures and audio, and Meta will bring an AI assistant to the editor later this year to help creators with development. In a demo I saw at Connect 2025, a developer had a conversation with an AI chatbot to request changes like a new environment and tweaks to the personality of an AI-driven NPC.Read Article >Today, 12:38 AM UTCJay PetersMeta will let you use a Quest VR headset to turn your real-world space into a virtual worldGordon Ramsay’s home kitchen as made by Hyperscape. Image: MetaMeta is rolling out tech that lets you capture a real-world space with a Quest VR headset so you can create a digital, photorealistic VR replica. The company calls the tech “Hyperscape,” and as part of a gradual rollout beginning today, users will be able to use the beta Hyperscape Capture app with their Quest 3 or Quest 3S to make the virtual copies. Initially, you’ll only be able to visit the rooms you’ve scanned by yourself, but Meta says that users will be able to visit rooms together by sharing a private link sometime “soon.”Meta showed off Hyperscape as part of a demo introduced at Connect 2024 last year, and while it seems like the tech is still somewhat early, it’s clear that the company sees virtual recreations of real environments as a potentially notable use case for VR and its metaverse ambitions. (Though those ambitions have seemingly taken a back seat to AI as of late.) You can see a Meta-provided example of Hyperscape in the GIF below that recreates Gordon Ramsay’s home kitchen.Read Article >Today, 12:36 AM UTCVictoria SongWe went from one to four AI smart glasses.This is kind of nuts if you really think about it. The Ray-Ban Meta glasses launched in 2023, and now, two years later there are four glasses announced in a variety of styles and designs. One with a display. That’s a massive leap forward in such a short period of time.Today, 12:35 AM UTCJay PetersZuck is wrapping up the discussion of Meta’s AI glasses.Which he calls Meta’s “fall 2025” lineup. See you next year?Today, 12:26 AM UTCVictoria SongOh my god, another failed live demo.Hm. I swear that in MY DEMOS this stuff worked. But this is a good example of why we need real-life testing for reviews.Today, 12:24 AM UTCVictoria SongMark Zuckerberg debates doing slides or a live demo.After that first live demo fail, I get why. But the crowd has demanded a live demo and so... here we go!Today, 12:23 AM UTCJay PetersHere’s Zuck wearing the new Meta Ray-Ban Display smart glasses.We went hands-on with the glasses this week.Today, 12:21 AM UTCAlex HeathI sat down with Mark Zuckerberg to try Meta’s impressive new Ray-Ban Display glassesMark Zuckerberg wearing the new Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses on Access. Credit Brett Putnam / AccessMark Zuckerberg mostly uses the new Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses to send text messages. Lots of them.He has been wearing the glasses around the office, firing off WhatsApp pings to his execs throughout the day. “I run the company through text messages,” he tells me recently.Read Article >Today, 12:20 AM UTCVictoria SongI regret to inform you Meta’s new smart glasses are the best I’ve ever triedI want to preface this hands-on by saying that I’ve been a smart glasses skeptic for many years. In 2019, I even made a two-part mini documentary with a thesis that consumer smart glasses couldn’t happen without massive societal and technological shifts. Well, color me pink and let me find a shoe to eat. After getting a demo of the $799 Meta Ray-Ban Display, I’m convinced this is the closest we’ve ever gotten to what Google Glass promised over 10 years ago.The glasses look just like a chunky pair of Ray-Bans. But put them on, pinch your middle finger twice, and a display will appear in front of your right eye, hovering in front of your vision. It’s not augmented reality overlaid on the real world so much as on-demand, all-purpose menu with a handful of apps. You can use it to see text messages, Instagram Reels, maps, or previews of your photos, letting you do all kinds of things without having to pull out your phone. In fact, since it pairs to your phone, it sort of functions like a pop-up extension of it.Read Article >Today, 12:14 AM UTCVictoria SongThe new Oakley Meta glasses are what athletes actually wantThis was what I had been expecting from Oakley smart glasses.
Photo by Colt Bradley / The VergeWhen the Oakley Meta HSTN arrived earlier this year, it wasn’t what I thought Oakley-branded smart glasses would be. Sure, they had Oakley’s famous PRIZM lenses, but where was the wraparound design? Where were the athlete-focused features like stronger water and sweat resistance? Confusingly, it felt like the HSTN glasses were just Ray-Ban Meta glasses by another name. But that’s because Meta had the real athlete-focused glasses in its back pocket. Today, the company unveiled the new $499 Oakley Meta Vanguard — and it has everything outdoorsy athletes could want and then some.“When we started building HSTN, it was an easier process of developing because most of the things we wanted for low-impact sports, like skating, don’t require a lot of technology in the eyewear from a performance standpoint,” says Oakley global president Caio Amato. Conversely, Amato says, the Vanguards were envisiond as a “revolution” not just for elite sports stars, but weekend warriors and everyday athletes.Read Article >Today, 12:14 AM UTCVictoria SongIf you missed the transparent Ray-Ban Metas last year, good news.There’s another transparent limited edition version in matte.

It’s not quite like a hearing aid feature, but it does remind everyone that the second-gen Ray-Bans are an audio-first device.Today, 12:09 AM UTCJay PetersZuck says that super intelligence will be “the most important technology in our lifetimes.”Meta has been investing a lot into AI as of late.Today, 12:07 AM UTCJay PetersMeta’s new Ray-Ban smart glasses have twice the battery lifePhoto: Colt Bradley / The VergeMeta has announced a new generation of its Ray-Ban smart glasses, featuring significantly improved battery life and the ability to record 3K video, which brings them up to par with the Oakley HSTN smart glasses. The new glasses, technically called the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2, are available to order today and start at $379.Let’s dig in on battery, which is better on a few fronts. You can use the new Ray-Bans for up to eight hours on a single charge, which is twice the four-hour battery life of the previous generation. The charging case can charge the glasses to 50 percent in 20 minutes — a slight improvement over the 22 minutes to 50 percent for the first generation. The case for the Gen 2 glasses offers an additional 48 hours of battery life, up from 32 hours.

Note how he says AI glasses, not smart glasses.Today, 12:05 AM UTCJay PetersZuck’s onstage.He was wearing a new pair of glasses that, according to a live video, have a display in the lens. He says he’ll talk more about them later.Sep 17Jay PetersRay-Ban’s website posts a “We’ll be back soon” note ahead of Meta Connect.Taking a move straight from Apple’s playbook.During Mark Zuckerberg’s keynote tonight at 8PM ET, we’re expecting some more glasses. Come back then, as Victoria Song and I will be covering the show live.Image: Ray-BanSep 17Jay PetersHow to watch Mark Zuckerberg’s keynote at Meta Connect 2025Image: Cath Virginia / The Verge, Getty ImagesMeta is about to kick off its annual Connect conference, beginning with a keynote address from CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Wednesday night. Zuckerberg plans to discuss “the latest on AI glasses” and will lay out “Meta’s vision for artificial intelligence and the metaverse,” according to the Connect website.As my colleague Victoria Song writes, Meta’s smart glasses are due for a major upgrade, and based on a leaked video from Meta, it seems like the company will announce exactly such a product during Connect: its first glasses with a screen. That video also showed new wraparound Oakley smart glasses. And Meta’s mention of the metaverse makes me think that Meta’s Horizon OS and VR work will get some airtime, as well.Read Article >More StoriesMost PopularMost PopularApple iPhone Air review: statement pieceVideoHere’s the Jimmy Kimmel clip that got him pulled off the airI regret to inform you Meta’s new smart glasses are the best I’ve ever triedVideoRepublicans are honoring Charlie Kirk’s memory by declaring war on the First AmendmentThe iPhone 17 is the one to get this yearThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
