She has written previously for Wirecutter, Wired, Dwell, BBC, and US News.The Ultraloq Bolt NFC smart lock is receiving a free upgrade that enables near-field communication (NFC) tap-to-unlock with compatible Android phones. The model currently supports Apple’s Home Key, which lets you tap-to-unlock with an iPhone. The update makes it one of the first locks to offer the functionality across both iOS and Android, without requiring the phone to be unlocked or specific apps to be running.RelatedAliro could unlock a new future for smart locks and digital keysHands-on with hands-free unlockingWatch me unlock a smart lock using Aliro.The ability comes via a free software upgrade to the U Home app, available now in the Google Play Store. Xthings, Ultraloq’s parent company, says its NFC unlock experience is an app-managed credential system, relying on Android’s NFC default app handling. This allows tap-to-unlock to work with an “out of the pocket” experience; no app needs to be open, no screen activated, no unlocking required, “just a simple tap.” The company states that it will support an estimated 99 percent of NFC-enabled Android smartphones currently on the market.According to Xthings, its NFC unlocking on Android works by setting the U Home app as the phone’s NFC handler, allowing it to “run as a lightweight background service to listen for NFC intents.” When you tap the phone against the lock, it triggers the Android system to wake the correct NFC handler and pass it to U Home for authentication.NFC unlocking requires both the phone and lock to support NFC, allowing you to tap to unlock in the same way you tap to pay. It’s a common feature on some smart locks for iPhone users, but Android phones have not had as many options, often requiring the use of a tag or key fob. An upcoming smart lock standard called Aliro aims to make NFC unlocking universal, regardless of phone manufacturer, but it hasn’t launched yet.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Jennifer Pattison TuohyCloseJennifer Pattison TuohySenior Reviewer, Smart HomePosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Jennifer Pattison TuohyNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsSmart HomeCloseSmart HomePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All Smart HomeTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMore in this streamSee allNest users can finally delete the Nest app.Jennifer Pattison TuohySep 15Amazon announces its fall hardware eventJennifer Pattison TuohySep 15Watch me unlock a smart lock using Aliro.Jennifer Pattison TuohySep 8Most PopularMost PopularApple’s new iPhone charger is a (second) of its kindThe unbearable sameness of Liquid GlassiOS 26 with Apple’s Liquid Glass redesign is out nowMicrosoft is changing how Xbox controllers work on Windows 11Meta leaks its new smart glasses with a displayThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
