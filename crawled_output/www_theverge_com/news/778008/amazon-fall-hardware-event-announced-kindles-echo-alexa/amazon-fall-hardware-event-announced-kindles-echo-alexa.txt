She has written previously for Wirecutter, Wired, Dwell, BBC, and US News.Amazon has sent out invitations to its annual fall hardware event, where it traditionally launches a slew of new products, including Echo smart speakers, Fire TV devices, Kindles, and sometimes dozens of other gadgets.

As well as new Echo devices, indicated by a blue Alexa light. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said earlier this year that the company would be releasing beautiful new hardware this fall.

Panay then hosted a major, hardware-free event in February 2025, where Amazon relaunched Alexa Plus, the LLM-powered version of its voice assistant.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Jennifer Pattison TuohyCloseJennifer Pattison TuohySenior Reviewer, Smart HomePosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Jennifer Pattison TuohyAmazonCloseAmazonPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All AmazonAmazon AlexaCloseAmazon AlexaPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All Amazon AlexaNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsSmart HomeCloseSmart HomePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All Smart HomeTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMore in this streamSee allNest users can finally delete the Nest app.Jennifer Pattison TuohySep 15Ultraloq adds Android tap-to-unlock to its Apple Home Key smart lockJennifer Pattison TuohySep 12Watch me unlock a smart lock using Aliro.Jennifer Pattison TuohySep 8Most PopularMost PopularApple’s new iPhone charger is a (second) of its kindMicrosoft is changing how Xbox controllers work on Windows 11The unbearable sameness of Liquid GlassiOS 26 with Apple’s Liquid Glass redesign is out nowAirPods Pro 3 review: tripling down on a good thingThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
