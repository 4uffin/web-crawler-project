She has written previously for Wirecutter, Wired, Dwell, BBC, and US News.Amazon has sent out invitations to its annual fall hardware event, where it traditionally launches a slew of new products, including Echo smart speakers, Fire TV devices, Kindles, and sometimes dozens of other gadgets. The event is scheduled for Tuesday, September 30th, 2025, in New York City.Related24 hours with Alexa Plus: we cooked, we chatted, and it kinda lied to meAll of the announcements from Amazon’s Alexa Plus eventAmazon finally has a color Kindle, and it looks pretty goodThe invitation hints at new Kindles — possibly a color Kindle Scribe? As well as new Echo devices, indicated by a blue Alexa light. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said earlier this year that the company would be releasing beautiful new hardware this fall. The Verge will be on the ground at the event later this month to cover all the announcements.The invite shows the words “stroke of a pen” on a color Kindle (spotted by The Verge’s Andrew Liszewski).

Panay then hosted a major, hardware-free event in February 2025, where Amazon relaunched Alexa Plus, the LLM-powered version of its voice assistant.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Jennifer Pattison TuohyCloseJennifer Pattison TuohySenior Reviewer, Smart HomePosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Jennifer Pattison TuohyAmazonCloseAmazonPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All AmazonAmazon AlexaCloseAmazon AlexaPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All Amazon AlexaNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsSmart HomeCloseSmart HomePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All Smart HomeTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMore in this streamSee allGoogle Nest may become Google Home again.Jennifer Pattison TuohyTwo hours agoTariffs kill the Starling Home Hub, Google Nest’s best bridge to Apple HomeJennifer Pattison TuohySep 17Nest users can finally delete the Nest app.Jennifer Pattison TuohySep 15Most PopularMost PopularI regret to inform you Meta’s new smart glasses are the best I’ve ever triedVideoHere’s the Jimmy Kimmel clip that got him pulled off the airMeta Connect 2025: the 6 biggest announcementsSamsung brings ads to US fridgesJimmy Kimmel Live pulled ‘indefinitely’ for joke about Charlie Kirk’s killer after FCC threatThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
