Released earlier this year, they were Apple’s first earbuds with heart rate monitoring but after next week’s big iPhone update their functionality will closely match the new AirPods Pro 3 announced earlier this week at Apple’s “Awe dropping” event.You’ll now be able to monitor your heart rate in real time through the Apple Fitness app during 50 different workout types while wearing the Powerbeats Pro 2 – a feature only supported through partner apps like Nike Run Club at launch. The earbuds will also work with Apple Fitness Plus, showing metrics like heart rate and calories burned on screen.Other upgrades coming to the Powerbeats Pro 2 with iOS 26 include a new algorithm for faster readings, step counting, notifications that include suggestions on how to improve the earbuds’ fit for improved accuracy, and heart rate monitoring while wearing just a single earbud, according to 9to5Mac.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Andrew LiszewskiCloseAndrew LiszewskiSenior Reporter, NewsPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Andrew LiszewskiAppleCloseApplePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All AppleAudioCloseAudioPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All AudioBeatsCloseBeatsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All BeatsFitnessCloseFitnessPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All FitnessGadgetsCloseGadgetsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GadgetsHeadphonesCloseHeadphonesPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All HeadphonesNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechWearableCloseWearablePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All WearableMost PopularMost PopularThe unbearable sameness of Liquid GlassiOS 26 with Apple’s Liquid Glass redesign is out nowApple’s new iPhone charger is a (second) of its kindMeta leaks its new smart glasses with a displayI’ve been using macOS Tahoe 26 since June and here are the eight best things about itThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
