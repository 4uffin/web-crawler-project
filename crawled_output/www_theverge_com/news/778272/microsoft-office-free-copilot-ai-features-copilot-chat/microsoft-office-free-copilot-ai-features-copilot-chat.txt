Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and OneNote are all being updated with a Copilot Chat sidebar that will help draft documents, analyze spreadsheets, and more without needing an additional Microsoft 365 Copilot license.“Copilot Chat is secure AI chat grounded in the web—and now, it’s available in the Microsoft 365 apps,” explains Seth Patton, general Manager of Microsoft 365 Copilot product marketing. “It’s content aware, meaning it quickly understands what you’re working on, tailoring answers to the file you have open. And it’s included at no additional cost for Microsoft 365 users.”While this free version of Copilot will rewrite documents, provide summaries, and help create slides in PowerPoint, the $30 per month, per user Microsoft 365 Copilot license will still have the best integration in Office apps. The Microsoft 365 Copilot license is also not limited to a single document, and can reason over entire work data.Copilot Chat inside PowerPoint.

Microsoft isn’t doing any price adjustments for businesses with Copilot Chat being added to Office apps. Microsoft is also getting ready to bundle its sales, service, and finance Copilots into the Microsoft 365 Copilot subscription in October, reducing the price for some businesses that rely on Microsoft’s latest AI tools.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Tom WarrenCloseTom WarrenSenior EditorPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Tom WarrenAICloseAIPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All AIMicrosoftCloseMicrosoftPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All MicrosoftNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMost PopularMost PopularAnker’s recent power bank recall involves over 481,000 unitsMeta’s failed smart glasses demos had nothing to do with the Wi-FiI regret to inform you Meta’s new smart glasses are the best I’ve ever triedVideoNest is dead, long live Google HomeYes, Jimmy Kimmel’s suspension was government censorshipThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
