He’s been a tech journalist for 20 years.Rivian’s heavily financed micromobilty spinoff Also is promising something on October 22nd. Also’s calling it “transcendent mobility,” which is a fancy way of saying e-bike after a poorly masked video leaked the rather unique design.While Also is a legally separate company from Rivian, it’s chaired by Rivian founder and CEO RJ Scaringe. Rivian also has a substantial minority ownership stake in the startup.Electrek’s Micah Toll did the dirty work of parsing a recent teaser video frame-by-frame to extract a few blurry images that Also failed to fully mask. What’s revealed is a compact pedal-assisted commuter than can double as a utility vehicle with optional cargo rack, integrated lighting, and what appear to be 20-inch wheels. It looks like a cross between a compact Gocycle electric bike and a Cake electric scooter. I can only hope that its battery can be easily swapped out and that it folds down to make it more suitable for multimodal travel on trains, trams, and the back of a Rivian.PreviousNext1/2I see a cargo rack and what should be a removable battery. Image: Also (via Electrek)Palo Alto-based Also had previously said that it plans to launch its first flagship product in early 2026 with an initial focus on the US and Europe. That could mean that whatever’s announced on October 22nd will have a healthy preorder period which is exactly what we’d expect from an EV company, even when that EV is a bicycle.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Thomas RickerCloseThomas RickerDeputy EditorPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Thomas RickerElectric BikesCloseElectric BikesPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All Electric BikesNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsRideablesCloseRideablesPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All RideablesTransportationCloseTransportationPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TransportationMost PopularMost PopularAnker’s recent power bank recall involves over 481,000 unitsMeta’s failed smart glasses demos had nothing to do with the Wi-FiNest is dead, long live Google HomeI regret to inform you Meta’s new smart glasses are the best I’ve ever triedVideoYes, Jimmy Kimmel’s suspension was government censorshipThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
