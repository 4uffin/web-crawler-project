Preorders for the gold or silver version of Moflin are now available through Casio’s US website. The robot, which looks like an oversized extra-fluffy hamster, is undoubtedly cute, but its limited capabilities could make its $429 price tag a tough sell.Unlike Sony’s robotic dog Aibo that can wander around your home, Moflin can’t get around on its own. Its movements are limited to its head that can rotate from side to side and tilt up and down which the robot uses to express simulated emotions and affection. It’s designed to be held and cuddled to provide “a calming presence” and “quiet reassurance,” according to Casio. But Moflin isn’t completely silent. It can make quiet sounds that will evolve over time to feel more expressive in order to create a stronger simulated bond with you.Moflin comes with a small bed that wirelessly charges the robot while it appears to sleep. Image: CasioMoflin can also recognize individual people through their voices and responds to touch through sensors hidden beneath its fur. Using AI it will develop a unique personality over time based on how you interact with it, which will vary from person to person. Moflin can end up being cheerful and will energetically move around while making sounds, or it can become quiet, docile, and shy if the robot isn’t interacted with enough. Despite being an electronic device, Casio hasn’t included a way to reset Moflin if you don’t like the personality it develops. Like a real pet, you’ll need to responsibly care for it right from the get go.Correction, September 17th: An earlier version of this article misstated the US pricing of Moflin. It’s $429.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Andrew LiszewskiCloseAndrew LiszewskiSenior Reporter, NewsPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Andrew LiszewskiGadgetsCloseGadgetsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GadgetsNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsRobotCloseRobotPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All RobotTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMost PopularMost PopularI regret to inform you Meta’s new smart glasses are the best I’ve ever triedVideoHere’s the Jimmy Kimmel clip that got him pulled off the airMeta Connect 2025: the 6 biggest announcementsSamsung brings ads to US fridgesYes, Jimmy Kimmel’s suspension was government censorshipThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
