This one pops up in the latest Windows 11 Insider Preview when mousing over an open app in your taskbar; it lets you share the contents with Copilot Vision.Want to know who is celebrating in that dogpile on the mound, or dig a little deeper on that sculpture you took a photo of? Just click that “Share with Copilot” button that pops up in the window preview. Copilot Vision scans what’s on your screen, analyzes it, and lets you discuss the contents of the window with Microsoft’s AI chatbot to get more context, including offering tutorials.Share with Copilot button in a Microsoft Edge window preview. Image: MicrosoftOf course, it doesn’t exactly seem like Windows users are clamoring for more Copilot in their lives. There’s already buttons popping up in Microsoft Paint, Notepad, in the taskbar, on your keyboard, and right on the front of some PCs. There’s even another, more useful Copilot feature in the same Windows 11 preview that translates on-screen text.
