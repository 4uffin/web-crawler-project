You’ll also be able to play “mini-matches” or full games against Duolingo’s Oscar character, who serves as your coach through the lessons.A GIF of Duolingo’s chess course. GIF: DuolingoDuolingo gave me a brief demo of the chess course on a recent video call, and it looks like it could be a lot of fun. The team’s approach was to “make chess as accessible as possible,” Duolingo group product manager Edwin Bodge tells The Verge, and the course will offer lessons for a wide range of skill levels so that people can jump in at whatever level of familiarity they already have for chess.Chess joins topics like music and math that aren’t language-based but can still be practiced via Duolingo. I asked if the company plans to build courses around other games, and staff software engineer Sammi Siegel says that “while we don’t have any plans to share right now, I think we’re just seeing how this launch goes and then we’ll go from there.”The chess course is launching in beta testing on iOS in English, according to Monica Earle, Duolingo’s PR director. Earle estimates that in four to six weeks, more people on iOS will be able to try it, and then it will head to Android and be available in other languages down the line.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Jay PetersCloseJay PetersSenior ReporterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Jay PetersAppsCloseAppsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All AppsEntertainmentCloseEntertainmentPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All EntertainmentGamingCloseGamingPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GamingNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMost PopularMost PopularI regret to inform you Meta’s new smart glasses are the best I’ve ever triedVideoHere’s the Jimmy Kimmel clip that got him pulled off the airMeta Connect 2025: the 6 biggest announcementsSamsung brings ads to US fridgesYes, Jimmy Kimmel’s suspension was government censorshipThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
