Tesla proved with the Model S that customers would want to buy luxury vehicles powered by lithium-ion batteries. Other EV startups like Faraday Future, Byton, Lucid Motors, and SF Motors are chasing after Elon Musk. And major automakers like Jaguar, Audi, and Mercedes-Benz have each released their own Tesla challengers. There are obstacles, such as the need for a more robust charging network.

HawkinsSep 9LinkTesla wants to bring its ‘robotaxis’ to Silicon Valley’s airports.Politico reports that the company is seeking ridehailing permits from San Francisco, Oakland, and San Jose airports. But this is a bit like putting the robo-cart before the horse. Tesla still hasn’t acquired permits from California’s DMV to operate a fully driverless robotaxi service in the state. Instead, it has safety monitors in the driver seat in all its ridehailing vehicles in the state.Tesla eyes San Francisco, San Jose airports for ride-hailing service[Politico]NewsNewsTesla says its new Megablock can cut costs for renewable energy storageJustine CalmaSep 9NewsNewsHyundai’s out-of-this-world EV concept is a glimpse at the upcoming Ioniq 3Andrew J.

That’s about $3,600 more expensive than the Model Y Long Range AWD in China. The range is 751 km (466 miles) on the CLTC driving cycle, which is typically more generous than the WLTP and EPA estimates. Here in the US, we’re still waiting for the cheaper version of the Model Y.PreviousNext1/6Image: TeslaTeslaTeslaTesla will sell you back the turn signal stalk it removed from the Model 3Andrew J.
