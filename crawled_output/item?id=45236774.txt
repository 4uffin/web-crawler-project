For some reason while reading this, I thought of Erlang, a language I know nothing about, except that it's not a visual language and it's build out (many) processes, kind of like a tiny internet with server and client nodes that can be taken down anytime for repairs or updates.Maybe there's an unobvious way to make visual programming actually useful?Probably quite a few people have wondered that throughout the ages. I know I have.In the meantime, this AI thing happened, emphasizing even more the use of text/voice as a mode of creative expression.replyAfterHIA 15 minutes ago
