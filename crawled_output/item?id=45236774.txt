It would be awesome if someone could fund a free open source version of Simulink (as a VSCode plugin or something like that) so that we can build normal software using model-based design.Simulink is getting more expensive every year, and licensing is a huge barrier to open source models.I’d do it if someone has a philanthropic half a million bucks or so… once it exists probably people would pay for support since Simulink with all the bells and whistles is around $15K per person per year.replyindigoabstract 1 hour ago

For some reason while reading this, I thought of Erlang, a language I know nothing about, except that it's not a visual language and it's build out (many) processes, kind of like a tiny internet with server and client nodes that can be taken down anytime for repairs or updates.Maybe there's an unobvious way to make visual programming actually useful?Probably quite a few people have wondered that throughout the ages. I know I have.In the meantime, this AI thing happened, emphasizing even more the use of text/voice as a mode of creative expression.replyTowaway69 26 minutes ago

Have a look at Erlang-Red[1] which uses Erlang for the basis of making a visual programming environment.Erlang-Red is inspired by Node-RED which itself is inspired by flow based programming.[1] https://github.com/gorenje/erlang-redDisclaimer: I’m the author of Erlang-Red.replysublinear 9 minutes ago

> Maybe there's an unobvious way to make visual programming actually useful?I'd think it would be finding the optimal parameters for an algorithm that is probably better expressed in another language.Even though they are all Turing complete, any programming paradigm is biased towards solving certain kinds of problems.It seems "visual programming" is biased towards the computationally irreducable[1]. This is a class of problem very sensitive to initial conditions. The chaotic behavior may eventually settle towards a stable state. So, the image of that stable state then encodes the parameters you'd want to use on the algorithm you wrote in another language.That's not meant to be harsh. This gets directly to the heart of why we may want to write the same ideas in different ways even if those writings seem logically equivalent. One way is just easier to understand than the other and these multiple writings are not redundant. They are the facets necessary to more thoroughly explain a problem. In fact, upon closer inspection you'd find that what seems like the same algorithm written two different ways is actually not the same because they are executed differently.[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_irreducibilityreplyboopity2025 46 minutes ago

Feels like visual programming keeps trying to be “code, but with pictures” instead of asking what problems pictures are actually good at solving. We’ve basically been drawing the same boxes and arrows since the 80s and wondering why it still feels like wiring up a VCR.If we really leaned into the visual cortex, maybe we’d get something where zooming out shows the big picture and zooming in shows the gritty details, like Google Maps for code. Until then, node‑and‑wire diagrams are just UML diagrams that decided to cosplay as circuit boards.replyspacebacon 28 minutes ago

Fundamentally underestimates the chaotic, exploratory essence of innovation. I challenge you to write the argument for form over function for good measure. Form follows function inside the box.replyAfterHIA 1 hour ago

Dude fucking Google, "e-Toys and, "Mindstorms by Seymour Papert" and get back to me.#ted #nelson #engelbartreplyuncircle 16 minutes ago

I won’t comment on your tone and unterminated string quotes, but the link seems interesting enough to share: https://worrydream.com/refs/Papert_1980_-_Mindstorms,_1st_ed...reply
