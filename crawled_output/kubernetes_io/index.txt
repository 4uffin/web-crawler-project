Production-Grade Container OrchestrationLearn Kubernetes Basics
Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery. Kubernetes builds upon 15 years of experience of running production workloads at Google, combined with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community.Planet ScaleDesigned on the same principles that allow Google to run billions of containers a week, Kubernetes can scale without increasing your operations team.Never OutgrowWhether testing locally or running a global enterprise, Kubernetes flexibility grows with you to deliver your applications consistently and easily no matter how complex your need is.Run K8s AnywhereKubernetes is open source giving you the freedom to take advantage of on-premises, hybrid, or public cloud infrastructure, letting you effortlessly move workloads to where it matters to you.To download Kubernetes, visit the download section.The Absolute Beginner's Guide To Cloud Nativeby Kyle Penfound, Dagger & Cortney Nickerson, KubeshopWatch Video

If something goes wrong, Kubernetes will rollback the change for you. Take advantage of a growing ecosystem of deployment solutions.Service discovery and load balancingNo need to modify your application to use an unfamiliar service discovery mechanism. Kubernetes gives Pods their own IP addresses and a single DNS name for a set of Pods, and can load-balance across them.Storage orchestrationAutomatically mount the storage system of your choice, whether from local storage, a public cloud provider, or a network storage system such as iSCSI or NFS.Secret and configuration managementDeploy and update Secrets and application configuration without rebuilding your image and without exposing Secrets in your stack configuration.Automatic bin packingAutomatically places containers based on their resource requirements and other constraints, while not sacrificing availability. Mix critical and best-effort workloads in order to drive up utilization and save even more resources.Batch executionIn addition to services, Kubernetes can manage your batch and CI workloads, replacing containers that fail, if desired.Self-healingKubernetes restarts containers that crash, replaces entire Pods where needed, reattaches storage in response to wider failures, and can integrate with node autoscalers to self-heal even at the node level.Horizontal scalingScale your application up and down with a simple command, with a UI, or automatically based on CPU usage.IPv4/IPv6 dual-stackAllocation of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses to Pods and ServicesDesigned for extensibilityAdd features to your Kubernetes cluster without changing upstream source code.Case Studies"Kubernetes is a great platform for machine learning because it comes with all the scheduling and …"Read more"Kubernetes is a great solution for us.
