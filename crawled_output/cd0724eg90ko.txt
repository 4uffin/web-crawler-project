We salute you".The World Boxing Association said Hatton's legacy would "live on in every fight and in the hearts of boxing fans around the world", describing him as a "true champion, an indomitable spirit and a legend of the sport".Frank Warren was Hatton's promoter from his professional debut in 1997 to his world title victory over Tszyu in 2005.He wrote on X: "A superbly talented fighter who inspired a generation of young boxers and fans in a way very few had done before, due to both his personality and the entertainment he provided in the ring."From making his debut in Widnes in 1997 to then go on to win one of the most historic fights in British boxing history against Kostya Tszyu in Manchester, Ricky will rightly go down as one of the modern greats of this sport."Hatton was a well-known Manchester City fan and the club said a minute's appreciation will be held before Sunday's Premier League match against Manchester United at Etihad Stadium at 16:30 BST.A club statement read: "Hatton wore sky blue shorts and used 'Blue Moon' as his walkout song throughout his career. Ricky was one of City's most loved and revered supporters. He will always be remembered."Former City defender Micah Richards told Sky Sports: "The news is devastating. He's such a British icon - a true Man City fan - but most importantly he was a man of the people. He was the nicest guy ever."Former Manchester United midfielder Roy Keane described Hatton as a warrior, adding: "He gave everything for that sport. He left everything in that ring."To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.This video can not be playedMedia caption, Greatest Fights - Ricky Hatton on Hatton v TszyuRelated topicsBoxingMore boxing from the BBCNotifications, social media and more with BBC SportPublished16 AugustTop storiesLive.Â Ricky Hatton's legacy will 'live on' as tributes pour in for champion boxer29429 viewing29k viewingLive.Â Premier League: Build up to Man City v Man Utd - Donnarumma makes debut for hosts23949 viewing24k viewingLive.Â Watch: England playing Scotland in Women's Rugby World Cup quarter-final25606 viewing26k viewingElsewhere on the BBCAcclaimed period mystery with an all-star castHow the 1933 Enabling Act gave Adolf Hitler unchecked powerA challenging story of sexual identity starring Brian CoxSpinal Tap: The legendary comic band reunite after 40 yearsElsewhere in Sport'Crawford conquers Canelo to become the face of boxing'Seville storms to 100m gold as Bolt cheers him on.
