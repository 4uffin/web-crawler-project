This seems bizarre to me. Why do people think they'll learn anything from what few fragments of dna they can recover? From a single unique individual?
Seems like a big waste of money.replycatlikesshrimp 14 hours ago

It is interesting that the average age of conception in the series is 33 years (21 generations in 700 years) It seems an old age, historically.The age of coming of women in my country was 15 years old. I think it was common in Latin America. The age of consent is now 16 yo. In Colombian is 14 yo, I think.replyapothegm 13 hours ago

This is the Y chromosome. On average men start families later than women do.replycatlikesshrimp 12 hours ago

Your comment made me realize something: Men do start families later than women do, and it is mostly sons in their families who are recognized. The sons they have before starting families can go unnoticed. Now the older age average makes more sense.replyp1esk 14 hours ago

We only know the average of the age of conception of the group of male descendants trace. I explained why I fancied the average age lower. What do you think could make it actually higher, hypothetically?replylif 14 hours ago

tl;dr:"15 direct male-line descendants related genealogically to both Leonardo's father and to his half-brother"replyjojomodding 13 hours ago

They haven't proven any genetic relationships between the currently alive and the ancient entombed bodies yet. So far they only confirmed that the currently alive people all share a straight-line male ancestor.replyttoinou 13 hours ago
