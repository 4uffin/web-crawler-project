Pilocarpine has been already approved in the US since 2021 under the trade name Vuity (pilocarpine hydrochloride 1.25%), which was discussed on HN [1]. Another version, Qlosi (pilocarpine HC 0.4%), was approved in 2023.It seems that this formulation differs by adding naproxen, an NSAID. I'm not sure why they believe this is needed.[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29509163replycianmm 54 minutes ago

If they invented this for shortsightedness, which I have very slightly, I would pay a huge amount of money (in European medical cost terms) for it.I mildly dislike wearing glasses but need them or I have a headache within an hour, I can’t overcome my blink reactions to put in contacts (after several hour long sessions with my optometrist) and my shortsightedness isn’t strong enough to convince myself to go for laser eye surgery.replyHWR_14 53 minutes ago

There are new non laser surgeries either in the testing or just released stages. I only know about them because they were on HN in the past 6 months.Easiest link I found: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44938818replyceejayoz 10 minutes ago

I suspect the issue is less the "laser" bit than the "eye surgery" bit.replyrr808 47 minutes ago

Vuity is just Pilocarpine -- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PilocarpineNot something that is recommended for ordinary bad vision - as it mostly works to treat eye pressure (one particular type of age related vision correction).replysroussey 1 hour ago
