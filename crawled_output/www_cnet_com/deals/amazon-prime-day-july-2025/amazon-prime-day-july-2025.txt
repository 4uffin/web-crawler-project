Google Pixel 3: $237 In our testing, the Google Pixel Watch 3 proved impressive, largely due to its sleek design, large screen and fast charging. It's our favorite Android smartwatch, and Lisa Eadicicco, CNET's former tech senior editor, said in her review, "The Pixel Watch 3's upgrades are enough to keep it as my top pick for a general purpose Android smartwatch. If you're anything like me and consider yourself a casual runner in need of a general-purpose Android watch that's sleek and comfortable, the Pixel Watch 3 won't disappoint." The 41mm model s linked below, but if you want the larger 45mm watch, it is $115 off right now, which means you can grab that for $285.

Wednesday is the second day of the event, and deals are rolling in across a wide range of categories. Some deals may last throughout the event, while others could sell out -- that is especially true if you see a lightning deal. Do I have to be an Amazon Prime member to shop Prime Day?To access most Prime Day deals, you'll need to be a Prime member. If you've always wanted the benefits of Prime but haven't made the jump, now's a great time to subscribe. Subscribing now could lead to significant savings as tariffs are expected to raise prices on a lot of goods. A recent CNET survey found that 64% of shoppers have bought or plan to buy tech products soon to avoid price increases or shortages. In fact, 16% of shoppers say they're using Prime Day to start their holiday shopping well ahead of the holiday season, according to a new RetailMeNot survey. (Disclosure: RetailMeNot is owned by the same parent company as CNET, Ziff Davis.)Read more: How to Sign Up for a Prime MembershipPrevious Amazon Prime Day datesSince Amazon launched its first Prime Day sale in 2015, the company has scheduled the event for around the same time of year. Outside of a couple of recent years, Amazon has traditionally kicked off its main sale event around the middle two weeks of July and 2025 is no exception. Here are the previous Amazon Prime Day dates:Prime Day 2015: July 15Prime Day 2016: July 12Prime Day 2017: July 11 to 12Prime Day 2018: July 16 to 17Prime Day 2019: July 15 to 16Prime Day 2020: Oct. 13 to 14Prime Day 2021: June 21 to 22Prime Day 2022: July 12 to 13Prime Early Access Sale 2022: Oct. 11 to 12Prime Day 2023: July 11 to 12Prime Big Deal Days 2023: Oct. 10 to 11Prime Day 2024: July 16 to 17Prime Big Deal Days 2024: Oct. 8 to 9Big Spring Sale 2025: March 20 to 25Prime Day 2025: July 8 to 11Will tariffs affect this year's Prime Day deals?Tariffs are top of mind for most Americans and it could affect this year's Prime Day event. Prices on items like electronics could very well increase, with companies like Apple trying to avoid tariffs by moving manufacturing operations elsewhere. The tariffs are currently paused, but only until Wednesday, right after Prime Day began. What is Prime Day?Amazon began the annual Prime Day tradition in 2015. And ever since, bargain hunters have eagerly awaited its return every summer. The Prime Day sale event has historically taken place in July, and this year is no exception. Amazon often has other sales throughout the year, including a second Prime Day-like sale in October and the Big Spring Sale in March.This year's Prime Day is here, and we've covered all the essentials already, including everything from signing up for Amazon Prime and returning Prime Day purchases to getting Prime Day deals free and using extra Prime perks.How we choose dealsCNET has a team of shopping experts and deal hunters who have operated across major sales events for many years, making sure you understand when a deal is worth taking advantage of or when it's worth skipping. Whether it's for Black Friday, Memorial Day, the Fourth of July or Prime Day, we have the expertise to make sure you get the best deal possible. To do this, we look for real discounts, quality reviews and remaining sale time when choosing an offer to show you. Real discounts mean real discounts. We look at the price history for that product to make sure no manufacturers are inflating prices to make the discount seem more substantial than it is.Quality reviews are equally important for any product, but particularly for deeply discounted items. If it breaks the first time you use it, the discount isn't really worthwhile.Remaining sale time is a huge part of our vetting process. If a deal seems like it will only be around for a short while or will only be available for the remaining stock, we'll let you know in advance, so you don't return later only to be disappointed. We are also considering the rising costs associated with tariffs to help you find items worth buying now.

Google Nest Learning Thermostat (4th gen): $219 The fourth-gen Google Nest Learning Thermostat and Temperature Sensor work with Alexa, Apple HomeKit and the Google Home app. CNET expert Tyler Lacoma noted that, "It turns out a $280 smart thermostat isn't such a tough sell when I can see how mine will pay for itself in just about a year" -- and this discount makes that even more likely. He even pointed out that the "Automated Eco Modes make energy saving easy, even if you don't have time to plan out your schedule." Google's research indicates people save around 10% to 15% on their energy bills with a smart thermostat, so if you've been considering taking the leap, now's your chance.
