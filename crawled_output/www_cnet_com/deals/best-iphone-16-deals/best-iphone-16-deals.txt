One important thing to keep in mind is that most trade-in deals from carriers require you to become a customer and they often apply to the priciest plan options.Select retailers with trade-in programs could offer gift cards toward future purchases instead, so you don't necessarily have to be locked into a contract to take advantage of the savings you can get from parting with your old device. However, those offers may not provide as much of a deal as traditional trade-in offers.
