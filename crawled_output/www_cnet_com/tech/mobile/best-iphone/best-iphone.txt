What to consider
iOS or Android?
If your family and friends are on Apple services like iMessage and FaceTime, stick with an iPhone. If you’ve been deep on Samsung, stay on Android. But know that switching between the two has never been easier.
Size
Phones are big in general, with the smallest ones having a 6.1-inch screen and larger models topping out at 6.8 inches. That makes visiting a store and trying a phone out before you buy it quite important.
Cameras
Phone cameras have gotten better over the past five years. But don’t be fooled by how many cameras a phone has. More is not necessarily better.
Software support
Phone makers promise varying lengths of long-term software and security support, ranging from just one year to as many as seven. These updates not only ensure you get many of the latest features, but also keep your phone secure.

Apple announced its new iPhone line this week, featuring a base iPhone 17, a thin iPhone Air and a high-end iPhone 17 Pro. These new phones will replace the iPhone 16 line as the top flagship models. As a result, it might be wise to hold off on buying any new iPhone for a bit.

What to look forward to in 2025
If you need an Apple phone now, we've tested and reviewed the iPhone 16 lineup, as well as some older models available for purchase. You have a lot of options depending on your needs and budget. The $829 iPhone 16 gets you additional buttons for shortcuts and MagSafe. The $999 iPhone 16 Pro has a bigger screen and a main camera with a new sensor.
This story is part of
Gift Guide, our year-round collection of the best gift ideas.
What's the best iPhone right now?The best iPhone for most people is the $799 iPhone 16. We think the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus are ideal for most people looking for a great phone that will last for years. It comes in two sizes: a 6.1-inch regular iPhone 16 model or a larger, 6.7-inch iPhone 16 Plus model that starts at $899. The phones have a new 12-megapixel ultrawide camera that performs better in low light and can now take macro photos, meaning you'll be able to focus close to take amazing food snaps.The iPhone 16 and 16 Plus have a handful of Apple Intelligence tools for writing, removing distractions from photos and creating summaries of messages and web pages. There's also ChatGPT integration with Siri. The phones have an Action button, too, which can be programmed for different functions like turning on the flashlight, recording a voice memo, changing the focus mode and more. There's also a new Camera Control button that not only lets you take photos and quickly change things like zoom, Portrait mode aperture and Photographic Styles, but can also trigger a new feature called Visual Intelligence, which will add context to whatever the camera is pointed at.Best iPhones of 2025

Best iPhone
Apple iPhone 16
Pros
Camera Control is useful for switching camera settings
Photographic Styles makes photos pop
Ultrawide camera is better in low light
Cons
Apple Intelligence isn’t out yet
No always on display
No changes to wired charging speeds
No upgrades to the Action button
When I tested the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus I was definitely impressed by the new photography features, the convenient Action button and the elegant build. I consider these phones to be top-notch choices for Apple fans. Parts of the iPhone 16’s key feature, Apple Intelligence, are now out, and the fact that these phones will support it means they’ll likely feel future-proofed for years to come. Aside from screen size (6.1 inches on the regular, 6.7 inches on the Plus), battery size and price, the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus are identical in every way.The iPhone 16 isn’t perfect -- it’s missing an always-on display, and it feels like it’s been ages since Apple improved its wired charging speeds. But it checks all the important boxes and then some.Why we like itThe iPhone 16 and 16 Plus rank so high in our testing because the phones appeal to both novice users and power players a like. They offer about 90% of the experience of Apple's Pro models but cost hundreds of dollars less. Not only is the iPhone 16 a wonderful phone out of the box, Apple has a long track record of updating its software and security patches for years.Who it's best forWhen you think about how the Camera Control key, the Action button and the Dynamic Island come together, along with the camera and battery improvements Apple has made over the last several years, the iPhone 16 is a compelling upgrade for someone coming from an older iPhone, especially if that person is on an iPhone 13 or older. For those who don’t need the Pro’s extra photography prowess and battery life, the iPhone 16 won’t disappoint. Who shouldn’t get itI wouldn't recommend buying the iPhone 16 just for the Camera Control button or the better ultrawide camera.  ... Show more

Best entry level iPhone
Apple iPhone 16E
Pros
Does most of the Apple stuff I want
Battery life is great
Matte finish back
The rear camera is good
A18 chip performance
Cons
$599 price isn't cheap
Odd value proposition
Lacks MagSafe
Screen is good, but wonder how it will age
Apple took a Taco Bell-like approach with the $599 iPhone 16E, mixing and matching parts and features from prior phones to create a "new" iPhone. Its design and screen are similar to the iPhone 14. Its A18 processor is the same as the one in the iPhone 16. In my testing, I found that this gives the iPhone 16E a weird value proposition. It's new, but it's old. It's affordable, but not cheap.If you're rocking an iPhone SE, an iPhone 11 or older, the 16E will be a nice upgrade in every way, from the camera to the battery life -- though you might miss that ultrawide camera. I also think that this is a good phone for people using Android phones who want to switch and dip the proverbial toe into Apple's waters. I do recommend looking into carrier deals, discounts and trade-ins to drop that price a bit, unless you're set on doing an installment plan over a couple of years. Read our iPhone 16E review.Why we like itAfter testing the iPhone 16E, I was most surprised by how wonderfully uneventful it was to use. Along with all the standard iOS 18 functions and goodies, like iMessage and FaceTime, I used Apple Intelligence, made calls on 5G, took a bunch of share-worthy photos and videos and played video games like Resident Evil 4. If this is all you want in an iPhone, look no further.Who it's best forIf you're rocking an iPhone SE, an iPhone 11 or older, the 16E will be a nice upgrade in every way, from the camera to the day plus battery life -- though you might miss that ultrawide camera. I also think that this is a good phone for people using Android phones who want to switch and dip the proverbial toe into Apple's waters.Who shouldn't get itChoosing between the $829 iPhone 16 and the $599 16E is a tough choice. If you have the budget, I'd go with the regular 16. You get a brighter screen, MagSafe, and an ultrawide camera that doubles as a macro lens -- great for taking close-up photos like of food since the main camera automatically switches to a cropped version of the ultrawide in order to nail focus.  ...

Best iPhone under $700
iPhone 15
Pros
USB-C port is more convenient charging
Colorful matte design
Improved camera that can automatically take people and pet portraits
Dynamic Island brings better multitasking
Cons
No always-on display
Find My Friends feature only works with other iPhone 15 phones
Discounted iPhone 14 Pro may be a better value
Galaxy S24 offers a longer optical zoom
With the launch of the iPhone 16, the regular iPhone 15 is being sold at a discount -- $100 off. That means that the iPhone 15 now starts at $699. And you might be able to find steeper discounts throughout the coming weeks and months. With the Dynamic Island, a USB-C port for more convenient charging and a high resolution camera and a sharper digital zoom, I found the iPhone 15 to be a significant upgrade for those with older iPhones.The iPhone 15 is available in two size options: the 6.1-inch iPhone 15 and the 6.7-inch iPhone 15 Plus. They run on the same chip as iPhone 14 Pro, the A16 Bionic, which should bring notable performance upgrades to those with an iPhone that's several years old. These phones also have Apple's second-generation ultra wideband chip, enabling a new feature that makes it easier to find friends or family members in a crowd which I found handy. Read our full iPhone 15 review.Why we like itThe iPhone 15 and 15 Plus are heavily influenced by the iPhone 14 Pro. That includes the Dynamic Island, a dedicated area near the top of the screen for viewing time-sensitive data like your Uber's ETA, and the A16 Bionic processor. Overall, these changes come together to make the iPhone 15 feel like a big step forward for those upgrading from an aging iPhone.Who it's best forThe iPhone 15 is for someone coming from an iPhone 12 or older. In 2025, Apple sells it for $699. But I recommend looking for one that's discounted. If you're contemplating the iPhone 16E but really want an ultrawide camera (remember the 16E only has a single rear camera) and MagSafe charging, then grab an iPhone 15.Who shouldn't get itApple sells the $599 iPhone 16E which makes the iPhone 15 a curious value. If you can score a discounted iPhone 15 I'd go that way. But otherwise, the iPhone 16E might be a better buy.  ... Show more

Recent updates
In March 2025, we added the iPhone 16E to this list. The $599 price is more than Apple's previous cheap phone, the $429 iPhone SE, but it has a similar appeal especially for those currently on an older iPhone. Factors to consider when buying a new iPhone
Hold the iPhone first: You may love or hate the way it looks and feels in person.Don't discount the last year's model: Apple has a history of keeping recent iPhone models from previous years around at a lower price. You can get a great phone that does almost everything that a new iPhone 16 can do for a fraction of the price. The iPhone 15 packs a great camera and a big battery, but comes at a more reasonable price.Buy an iPhone case and screen protector: You'll protect your iPhone from costly damage, and will increase the phone's resale or trade-in value for when you're ready to move on.Know what you care about most: Is it screen size? Camera quality? Battery life? Phones like the iPhone 15 Pro or Pro Max, for example, pack incredible cameras that almost rival the quality you'd get from a DSLR. If you're a photographer, then spending money here is a good idea.Seek out holiday discounts: Look for deep discounts and promo deals around major holidays, especially Amazon's Prime Day and Cyber Monday. And find out what your grace period is in case you need a quick return or exchange. How we test iPhone models
We test every iPhone in real-world scenarios focusing on its features, design, performance, cameras, battery life and overall value. We document our findings in an initial review that is periodically updated when there are new iOS updates or to compare against new phones from competitors like Samsung, Google and OnePlus.
John Kim/CNETPhotographyPhotography is a major focus for the iPhone, so we take pictures and videos of various subjects in a variety of settings and lighting scenarios. We try out any new camera modes, such as 4K 120fps slow-mo video that debuted with the iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max.Battery lifeBattery testing is conducted in a variety of ways. We assess how long the iPhone lasts during a typical day of use, and note how it performs during more focused sessions of video calls, media streaming and gaming. We also conduct a video playback test and a 45-minute drain test starting with a full battery, which isn't always included in the initial review and added later in an update.
Tharon Green/CNETPerformance measuringWe use benchmarking apps to measure the performance, alongside our own anecdotal experiences using the phone for our review. Of particular note are how graphics and animations look. Are they smooth? Or do they lag or stutter? We also look at how quickly the phone switches between horizontal and vertical orientations and how fast the camera app opens and is ready to take a photo.
Emergency SOS might be one of the most important features to come out on any phone this year. Kevin Heinz/CNETWe perform processor-heavy tasks like editing photos and videos, exporting videos and playing games. We evaluate whether a newer version of the iPhone includes enough features to make it worth upgrading from older models. Some of these tests are added later in updates after the initial review is published. Read more: How CNET Tests Phones Other iPhones we tested
While Apple doesn't sell the iPhone 15 Pro, you can still find it at carriers and third-party retailers. The 15 Pro has a 6.1-inch adaptive-refresh rate screen that adjusts between 1-120Hz depending on what's on the screen. It has excellent cameras, a fast processor, an always-on display, supports iOS 18 and safety features like Crash Detection and Emergency SOS via Satellite. Driving all these upgrades is Apple's A17 Pro chip which in use feels peppy. The iPhone 15 Pro is still an excellent phone in 2025. Check out our iPhone 15 Pro review. Key terms
eSIMAn eSIM takes all of the important information about your phone account -- including its number, wireless carrier and subscription -- and stores it in software instead of on a physical SIM card.With the iPhone 14, 15 and 16 series Apple removed the physical SIM card tray and embraced embedded SIM cards in the US. This means you can't just pluck your SIM card out of your current phone and put it into a new one. But this shouldn't affect your experience since all the major US carriers and a number of smaller operators work with eSIM.Apple has long supported eSIM, dating back to 2018's iPhone XS, XS Max and XR. When setting up a new iPhone 14, 15 or 16, tthe device will guide you through transferring your current provider over to the new phone. A list of supported wireless networks can be found on Apple's website.iOS 18Apple's iOS 18 is the latest iPhone software version. It's on the iPhone 16 by default and is also available as an update for the iPhone XR and later. iOS 18 includes new features such as being able to move apps anywhere on your home screen, change an app icon's color and a size, add buttons to Control Center, use emoji and live photo stickers as Tapbacks in Messages, support for RCS in messages and eventually Apple Intelligence on some models. iPhone FAQs
When is the best time of year to buy a new iPhone?
Typically you will find the best deals on iPhones the month after new models launch. That means if the iPhone 17 launches in September (which is likely) then the best discounts and trade-in deals will be from early-September to earl-October.

iPhone or Android?
In the early days of smartphones the iPhone vs. Android rivalry was at it peak. But in 2025, the difference between Android and iOS has shrunk quite a bit. Nearly everything you can do on an iPhone, you can do on an Android phone and vice versa. If you are trying to decide between buying an iPhone or Android phones, first start by seeing what phones your family and closest friends use. For example, if your family is on iPhone and uses services like iMessage and FaceTime, then it makes sense to shop for an iPhone.

Should I wait for the new iPhone model (iPhone 17)?
Apple announced the iPhone 16 and 16 Pro in September 2024. And while there are already rumors about the iPhone 17, it likely won't go on sale until September 2025. In recent years, the changes between consecutive iPhone models hasn't been drastic. So if you need or want a new iPhone, I wouldn't wait for the iPhone 17.

How reliable is an iPhone?
Apple has been selling iPhones since 2007. The current lineup was released in September 2024 and all have a dust and water resistance rating of IP68, which means they can survive being submerged under 6 meters of water (about 20 feet) for 30 minutes. The screens are covered in Apple's Ceramic Shield which is a glass-ceramic material created by Corning, in collaboration with Apple, and consists of nano-ceramic crystals embedded in the glass matrix. It's highly transparent, and according to Corning, the tough structure formed by the crystals means it's less likely to break.

How long does an iPhone last?
One way to measure how long an iPhone will last is to look at the software and security support Apple offers for older models. iOS 18 can run on Apple phones as old as 2018's iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max and XR. That's roughly five years of software support. Compare that to Samsung, which offers seven years of Android version upgrades and security updates. But software is only half the equation. The other part is hardware and durability. Every iPhone Apple sells has an IP rating for dust and water resistance. Newer models also have Ceramic Shield, a glass-ceramic hybrid, that covers the display and is very durable.

What to look forward to in 2025
Apple's just-debuted iPhone 17 line features plenty of new changes, with the thin iPhone Air stealing the spotlight. Many of the best new iPhone features are heading to the entire line of 2025 iPhone models, including an 18-megapixel Center Stage front-facing camera that allows for horizontal and vertical selfies without needing to rotate the phone. We're looking forward to testing out the new line of iPhone models and updating this list
after we
compare them to the iPhone 16 line.
