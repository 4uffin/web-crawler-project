Buyers had to wait until Sept. 12, but the specific preorder time varied depending on your location. Here's when preorders officially opened at Apple, as well as other carriers and retailers:United States: 8 a.m. ET (5 a.m. PT)United Kingdom: 1 p.m. BSTAustralia: 10 p.m. AEST (8 p.m. AWST)Hong Kong: 8 p.m. HKTWhen does the iPhone 17 series launch?The iPhone 17 series was announced Sept. 9. You can preorder your new iPhone from the Apple Store, or from select retailers and carriers starting Friday, Sept. 12. The phones will ship on the official launch date, Friday, Sept. 19. Looking to switch to an Android phone? We've found plenty of Samsung Galaxy S25 and Google Pixel 10 deals, too.  What's new about the iPhone 17 series?Our CNET experts will test these phones and bring you thorough, in-depth reviews, but if Apple continues its long streak of producing excellent phones, we anticipate at least some of these new models to wind up on our best phones of 2025 roundup, as the iPhone 16 currently sits as our pick for the best phone for most people. The iPhone 17 comes with a new A19 chip, while the 17 Pro and 17 Air get an A19 Pro chip. There is a storage bump as well, up to a starting 256GB. That's double the base 128GB we saw in the previous iPhone 16.
Another exciting change coming with this series is iOS 26 and its minimalistic Liquid Glass feature, which should be released shortly after the event. But don't fret if you're not a fan of the new interface -- light and dark mode UIs will still be available if you prefer.How much does the iPhone 17 series cost?Prices differ depending on the amount of storage you buy, but here's the range:iPhone 17: From $799 (£799, AU$1,399)iPhone Air: From $999 (£999, AU$1,799)iPhone 17 Pro: From $1,099 (£1,099, AU$1,999)iPhone 17 Pro Max: From $1,199 (£1,199, AU$2,199)Hey, did you know? CNET Deals texts are free, easy and save you money.  What colors do the iPhone 17 models come in?iPhone Air: Space black, cloud white, light gold and sky blue.iPhone 17: Lavender, mist blue, sage, white and black.iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max: Silver, cosmic orange and deep blue.Shopping for a previous iPhone model? Our roundup of the best iPhone deals includes sales on the iPhone 16, iPhone 16E, iPhone 15 and more.How do I preorder the iPhone 17?You can preorder the iPhone 17 series at select online retailers and carriers right now, all the way until the Sept. 19 release date. We've listed preorder links above and will continue to update this page as more offers drop.First, decide which model iPhone you want to buy: iPhone 17, iPhone Air, iPhone 17 Pro or iPhone 17 Pro Max. Then, select your preferred color and storage capacity. You also need to decide if you'll trade in an older iPhone, which could get you up to $700 back from Apple, or more with select carrier deals.Once you make those decisions, you'll need to choose an optional carrier and AppleCare Plus coverage (or forgo it) and click the blue Add to Bag button. You can then include any accessories you want and enter your payment information to complete your purchase. These options will open Sept. 12.How do iPhone 17 trade-in offers work?There are multiple carriers offering trade-in savings through Apple, some valued at up to $1,100 on eligible trade-ins, which could net you a free iPhone 17 Pro. Not a fan of contracts? Some retailers also offer trade-in programs, which could offer gift cards toward future purchases instead. This can be a great way to take advantage of savings without necessarily being locked into a contract. Retail offers may not provide as much of a deal as traditional trade-in offers from carriers, though, so keep that in mind as you shop and more offers come online.*All information about the Apple Card has been collected independently by CNET and has not been reviewed by the issuer.
