However, this unassuming bottle from Amazon has us thinking maybe it might be possible for some. $35 at AmazonAdvertisement
Made by indie hair care brand Maple Holisitics, this biotin-infused shampoo promises to harness the power of all-natural ingredients to make fine or thin hair appear thicker and more nourished and the scalp more hydrated —and reviewers’ testimonies appear to support these claims.Even from the first wash, users of the Maple Holistics formula claim their fine hair looks and feels instantly thicker, more volumized and healthier, without having to add extra steps or products into their existing routine.With extended use, others are saying they’ve noticed a significant reduction in the amount of hair that falls out during washing, quicker hair growth, and, in some cases, even new hair growth in areas around the hairline where there was previous sparseness.Advertisement
AmazonMaple Holistics biotin shampoo uses all-natural ingredients to help hair appear fuller.Given what we’ve previously gathered from dermatologists and trichologists, some studies show that many of the active ingredients used in this sulfate-free and color-safe shampoo have been proven to support healthier and better hair growth — particularly rosemary oil.Dr. Marisa Garshick, a board-certified dermatologist with MDCS Dermatology in New York City, previously said that rosemary oil not only conditions and strengthens hair, but also helps reduce damage and breakage, thereby contributing to a stronger hair appearance.“Research has also indicated that rosemary oil can potentially accelerate hair growth by improving blood circulation in the scalp, which stimulates hair follicles,” Garshick added. And while there’s not enough substantial evidence to support that biotin plays a meaningful role in promoting hair growth (beyond what’s made anecdotally), Garshick said that ingredients like evening primrose oil and jojoba (which this formula contains) can address dryness and brittle-feeling hair. Another thoughtful inclusion is naturally antifungal tea tree oil, which can help suppress dandruff and other scalp conditions caused by fungi or bacteria. (According to some studies, the health and condition of the scalp can affect hair growth and retention.)
Additionally, vitamin E may be able to offer antioxidant benefits for healthier hair and scalp and argan oil, which is also rich in fatty acids and antioxidants, can add shine and moisture to strands and scalp.
Lightly and naturally fragranced like sandalwood, reviewers suggest letting the lathered shampoo sit on the hair and scalp for two minutes before washing out, per the brand’s directions. Many also like this shampoo so much that they’ve also begun pairing it with Maple Holistic’s matching conditioner, which can be purchased separately or as part of a set.

This is my first ever review but I just had to come on here and say that this shampoo is an absolute game changer! Nothing has ever grown my hair so quickly. I am a Black woman with pretty course hair. I purchased this for the first time 3 months ago and the difference in my hair so far is extremely notable. I have a ton of new growth. This product is a must buy!” — Cyndi Parrish“Definitely a notiecable difference! I’ve only used this a few times now so there’s no way it’s causing any actual new hair growth, but there is a huge and noticeable difference when using the shampoo. I haven’t changed any of my styling products or even conditioner. Just switched out my shampoo. I wash and let sit for two min like suggested. I don’t know what magic is in it but my hair definitely feels and looks fuller. My hair has been thinning due to health issues and none of that has changed. I started buying wigs because I was self conscious and feeling defeated every time I styled my hair because of the thinning. If it actually helps hair growth I’ll never use another shampoo again. I’ll have to report back later to see if I’ve noticed anything else as I finish the bottle.” — nk“I don’t usually write reviews, but I’m so happy with the results of this shampoo that I had to share. I’m a 29 M and about a 2 years ago, I started noticing an unusual amount of hair falling out while showering. Honestly, it really scared me. As the months went by, the hair loss seemed to get worse, to the point where I dreaded washing my hair for fear of seeing handfuls come out.I didn’t want to resort to medication, so I tried another hair-thinning shampoo, but it didn’t make much of a difference. My hair became visibly thinner, and when I styled it, I would fail the flashlight test. That’s when I decided to switch to this shampoo, and I’m so glad I did. Within three months, I noticed a significant improvement. The amount of hair falling out in the shower slowly decreased and now I’m down nt to just just 2-5 strands. I really didn’t notice at first but now when I look at my hair, I can see it’s physically thicker. I’ve also noticed a ton of baby hairs growing along my hairline, and my thinning corners are starting to fill in.It hasn’t been that long since I started using this shampoo, but I’m genuinely thrilled with the results so far. If you’re considering buying this product, I highly recommend it.” — Brandon & Molly Czworniak $35 at AmazonRelatedshoppingBeautyAmazonhair shampooReviewers Are Genuinely ‘Amazed’ By This $10 Oil For Thinning HairMy (And The Internet's) Favorite Thickening Shampoos For Thin Hair11 Products To Make Your Thinning Hair Look Thick, According To ReviewersThis Biotin Shampoo You've Probably Never Heard Of Works Great For Thinning Hair Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
