> There was for years an experimental period, when ethical and legal considerations about where and how to acquire training data for hungry experimental models were treated as afterthoughts.Those things were afterthoughts because for the most part the experimental methods sucked compared to the real thing. If we were in mid 2016 and your LSTM was barely stringing together coherent sentences, it was a curiosity but not a serious competitor to StackOverflow.I say this not because I don’t think law/ethics are important in the abstract, but because they only became relevant after significant technological improvement.replyjsnell 1 hour ago

The headline seems pretty aspirational.The licensing standard they're talking about will achieve nothing.Anti-bot companies selling scraping protections will run out of runway: there's a limited set of signals, and none of them are robust. As the signals get used, they're also getting burned. And it's politically impossible to expand the web platform to have robust counter-abuse capabilities.Putting the content behind a login wall can work for large sites, but not small ones.The free-for-all will not end until adversarial scraping becomes illegal.replyatm3ga 28 minutes ago

As AI companies like Perplexity introduce AI enabled browsers like Comet, they will scrape web sites through the interaction of end-users with whatever site they are using. Therefore, indeed anti-bot companies are absolutely running out of runway.replythelittleone 20 minutes ago

Wow hadn't even considered this... so say I have a members only section of my site where I share high value content, one of the members browses using Comet, and that scrapes the private content and sends to perplexity?replylupire 1 minute ago

This also happens with covert botnets running secretly on user machines.replycarlosjobim 38 minutes ago

Yes. Conglomeration and centralization. More, more, more!See the problem?replyWaltPurvis 1 hour ago

It is a bit ironic that a paywalled article like this will have a top level comment with the archive link, which can then be easily scraped by AI (along with the comments)replytenuousemphasis 12 minutes ago

It's not ironic at all. The only reason the anti-paywall sites work is that the news companies in fact want some scrapers reading the full article.reply1gn15 1 hour ago

Biased TL;DR: Reddit (notable for having a high stock value from their "selling data" business [1]), Medium, Quora, and Cloudflare competitor Fastly created a standard to restrict what the reader can do with the data users created, called Really Simple Licensing (RSL). Basically robots.txt but with more details, notably with details on how much you should pay Reddit/Medium/Quora.While this likely has no legal weight (except for EU TDM for commercial use, where the law does take into account opt-outs), they are betting on using services like CloudFlare and Fastly to enforce this.[1] https://www.investors.com/research/the-new-america/reddit-st...replyPhantomHour 1 hour ago

> While this likely has no legal weightI wouldn't be quite so sure about that. The AI industry has entirely relied on 'move fast and break things' and 'old fart judges who don't understand the tech' as their legal strategy.The idea that AI training is fair use isn't so obvious, and quite frankly is entirely ridiculous in a world where AI companies pay for the data. If it's not fair use to take reddit's data, it's not fair use to take mine either.On a technological level the difference to prior ML is straightforward: A classical classifier system is simply incapable of emitting any copyrighted work it was trained on. The very architecture of the system guarantees it to produce new information derived from the training data rather than the training data itself.LLMs and similar generative AI do not have that safeguard. To be practically useful they have to be capable of emitting facts from training data, but have no architectural mechanism to separate facts from expressions. For them to be capable of emitting facts they must also be capable of emitting expressions, and thus, copyright violation.Add in how GenAI tends to directly compete with the market of the works used as training data in ways that prior "fair use" systems did not and things become sketchy quickly.Every major AI company knows this, as they have rushed to implement copyright filtering systems once people started pointing out instances of copyrighted expressions being reproduced by AI systems. (There are technical reasons why this isn't a very good solution to curtail copyright infringement by AI)Observe how all the major copyright victories amount to judges dismissing cases on grounds of "Well you don't have an example specific to your work" rather than addressing whether such uses are acceptable as a collective whole.replyjanalsncm 13 minutes ago

> The very architecture of the system guarantees it to produce new information derived from the training data rather than the training data itselfA “classical” classifier can regurgitate its training data as well. It’s just that Reddit never seemed to care about people training e.g. sentiment classifiers on their data before.In fact a “decoder” is simply autoregressive token classification.replyisodev 1 hour ago

In other words, a lightweight form of DRM. Here come the reasons why we shouldn’t all deploy CloudFlare and similar as gatekeepers to the web.Is there even one example of a “tech mega corp” that has grown to control more than 1/5 of its market without this circling back to hurt people in some way? A single example?replyluckylion 1 hour ago

Does that have any implications on liability for content? They're no longer just a provider, they are re-licensing and marketing content. Are they losing protection?replydeadbabe 1 hour ago
