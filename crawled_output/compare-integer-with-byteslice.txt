I have a process that computes and checks the checksum in AIS messages, the checksum is the xor of all the bytes in the message expressed in hexadecimal format.
At the moment I am turning both the calculated and included checksums into strings and comparing them, which seems a bit compute heavy. Is there a better way to compare the single byte calculation with its 2 byte hexadecimal representation?
bytdata is the AIS message in a []byte{}.
j := i + 1
for ; j < leng ; j++ {
checkSum ^= (int)(bytdata[j])
}
checkBytes := fmt.Sprintf("%02X", checkSum)
if checkBytes == string(bytdata[(j+1):(j+3)]) {
// valid checksum......
etc
}

A compute light function: go.dev/play/p/VwqdBvsWI1S. []byte versus string: cpu around 80% lighter, allocations 100% lighter.

AIS checksum is one byte encoded as two ASCII hex character. you can parse these two and compare them directly instead of fmt.Sprintf:
import (
"encoding/hex"
)
j := i + 1
checkSum := 0
for ; j < leng; j++ {
checkSum ^= int(bytdata[j])
}
bytes := bytdata[j+1 : j+3]
msgCs, err := hex.DecodeString(string(bytes))
if err != nil || len(msgCs) != 1 {
return
}
if byte(checkSum) == msgCs[0] {}

too much cpu, too many allocations

@rocka2q can you please inform me how many executions per second are you thinking about for this particular piece of code ?

The number of executions per second is a function of the environment, hardware, software, performance settings, and so forth. Unless all factors are identical, it is a meaningless benchmark number. I carefully benchmarked a full, efficient checksum validation function against your code fragment. Consistently, across several machines and various architectures and settings, your code fragment CPU exceeded my full function CPU by at least 50%. Your code fragment made one allocation and my full function made zero allocations. The OP asked for a compute light implementation.
