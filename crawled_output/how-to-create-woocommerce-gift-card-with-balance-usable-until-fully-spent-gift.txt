How to create WooCommerce gift card with balance usable until fully spent (gift card code only, no user account)

I‚Äôm building a WooCommerce store where I want to sell physical gift cards.
We will generate a random code ourselves and write it on the card that we send to the customer.
Requirements:
Gift cards should be entered as a code at checkout, but unlike normal coupons they must keep a remaining balance that updates after each use.
When the code is entered at checkout, the order total is reduced.
If the order is less than the gift card balance, the remaining balance should stay on the code and be usable for the next order.
If the order uses up the entire balance, the code should become invalid (0 balance).
The system should not be tied to a user account or email ‚Äì only the code itself.
Problem with default WooCommerce coupons:
Standard coupons are one-time only.
Any unused amount is lost after the first use.
What I want to happen:
When a code is used, the coupon‚Äôs balance/amount should be updated automatically.
The used amount is deducted from the coupon‚Äôs balance, and the new balance should be stored for the next order.
This way, the same code works multiple times until the balance reaches zero.
üëâ Question:
Is there a lightweight way (e.g. PHP snippet, custom postmeta, or hook) to extend WooCommerce coupons so that the balance is updated after each use and remains until fully spent?
Or is there a minimal plugin that does this?
