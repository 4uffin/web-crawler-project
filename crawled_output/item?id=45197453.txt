This is melting my recent iPhone. But really nice otherwise. A movie about that is Winged Migrations from the same directors than Microcosmosreplyhopelite 1 hour ago

Odd. I’m on an older iPhone and it’s not even fazing it using Safari. Could it be the browser?replyttoinou 46 minutes ago

Im also using Safari and I see like 15 fps in very good graphics quality. Also maybe your iPhone has a smaller resolution.. ?replyhopelite 1 hour ago
