I have a BirdNET-Pi in my backyard constantly listening to and identifying bird songs. It's pretty neat. They also sell a purpose built device if you don't want to build a pi.The data is sent to https://app.birdweather.com/ where I'm assuming bird scientists are doing something with it.replylemonberry 11 hours ago

Very cool. I just spotted the last of the ruby throated hummingbirds at my feeder here in NH.I often hear people talking about aches and pains as signs of ageing, but for me it's been a heightened awareness and interest in birds and gardening. One of my best friends is a military guy that, unfortunately, saw combat and the terrible things that go with that. He's obsessed with his flowers and just this past week was sending me pictures of both flowers and bulbs.replyweinzierl 11 hours ago

I've recently implemented a similar service: https://adsb.exposed/?dataset=Birds&zoom=5 - a viewer for eBird data, where you can filter by various species and make visualizations with SQL.Full write-up on how it is created: https://clickhouse.com/blog/birdsreplymongol 9 hours ago

This is melting my recent iPhone. But really nice otherwise. A movie about that is Winged Migrations from the same directors than Microcosmosreplyhopelite 13 hours ago

Odd. I’m on an older iPhone and it’s not even fazing it using Safari. Could it be the browser?replyttoinou 12 hours ago

Im also using Safari and I see like 15 fps in very good graphics quality. Also maybe your iPhone has a smaller resolution.. ?replydkga 8 hours ago

That’s pretty darn cool. I just wish I could click on one of the tracked markets/birds to see their particular migratory route.reply
