Very cool. I just spotted the last of the ruby throated hummingbirds at my feeder here in NH.I often hear people talking about aches and pains as signs of ageing, but for me it's been a heightened awareness and interest in birds and gardening. One of my best friends is a military guy that, unfortunately, saw combat and the terrible things that go with that. He's obsessed with his flowers and just this past week was sending me pictures of both flowers and bulbs.replyweinzierl 2 hours ago

Cool project and covers hundreds of bird species. I wish there was something similar for Europe/Africa.replymongol 51 minutes ago

Do North American birds migrate to South America?
In viewing this, it seems they mostly stay within North America?replyttoinou 4 hours ago

This is melting my recent iPhone. But really nice otherwise. A movie about that is Winged Migrations from the same directors than Microcosmosreplyhopelite 4 hours ago

Odd. I’m on an older iPhone and it’s not even fazing it using Safari. Could it be the browser?replyttoinou 3 hours ago

Im also using Safari and I see like 15 fps in very good graphics quality. Also maybe your iPhone has a smaller resolution.. ?replyskylurk 2 hours ago

That’s pretty darn cool. I just wish I could click on one of the tracked markets/birds to see their particular migratory route.reply
