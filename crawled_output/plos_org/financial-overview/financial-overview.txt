Financial overview2023
As we enter an exciting new era for PLOS and will build on our catalytic legacy to effect positive change, we chart the course for a future where science is open to all, for all.Publishing our Financial Overview for 2023 provides us with the opportunity to look back and appreciate that we have been consistently building towards our new era. We have always worked to remove barriers and promote open knowledge sharing. We have pioneered new solutions when traditional approaches fell short. We have fostered collaboration among the scholarly community to advance our shared goals.While we have made significant progress, there is always another milestone to reach. We believe research communication can be better and we will make lasting change by focusing on the integrated pillars of open science publishing, policy, and practice.Moving towards equitable open science publishingBuilding a more inclusive knowledge-sharing ecosystem has always been central to the mission of PLOS. Our pioneering role in the movement for open science enablement , the growth of our journals portfolio to serve all areas of science, and our investment in open science tools and services for authors are paving the way for increased transparency and collaboration.So where do we go next? Beyond the research article.Rethinking the incentives and financial models that support research-sharing is critical to sustained and inclusive growth of open science. Prioritizing research articles prevents the appropriate recognition for all scholarly contributions and lacks incentive for open science practices. APCs perpetuate this system while creating financial barriers for many researchers to make their work open.While we have already demonstrated success in building alternative financial models, real change requires more participation from all stakeholders in the research community and an ongoing discussion of how we broaden open science for all researchers. With support from the Gates Foundation as well as the Robert Woods Johnson Foundation and Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation for two projects, we’ll be taking our goal of moving beyond articles and APCs even further into the future.Advancing open science policy through collaborationWe understand that policy plays an integral role in both safeguarding research integrity and advancing better research practice. We have built a long history as a trusted voice in scholarly publishing offering feedback and discussion on open science policy at the highest levels and leading standards for research integrity and publication ethics.In recent years we’ve started to work more closely with organizations and individuals globally to effect broader change. Through our regional policy workshops in partnership with TCC, we have proven ability to foster better understanding of open access publishing and a willingness to take action locally to support open access mandates. Our work with JISC and cOAlition S is setting the stage to enable equitable participation in knowledge-sharing and a more inclusive open science future. Our industry-leading Publication Ethics team has met emerging challenges such as paper mills and the role of AI with strengthened policies across our portfolio and collaboration with integrity groups to develop best practices industry-wide.We now have an office presence across four continents enabling us to build relationships with local organizations and individuals who share our vision. Together, we can advocate for solutions that will make open science better for all.Inspiring and monitoring open science practiceTo make all of this work possible on a global scale, a united community of publishers, researchers, institutions, funders, and policymakers working together is more important than ever. We are already fortunate to work with partners such as TCC, Global Young Academy, and the Einstein Foundation to advance the adoption of open science practices and policies which will become foundational to the next generation of scientists.Understanding where we are starting from is crucial to finding the path forward. Our own research and Open Science Indicators will be important tools for the work ahead, enabling us to collaboratively develop solutions with maximum impact.Throughout all of our work, we’re committed to seeking feedback from the community and sharing what we learn to drive lasting change.
