A catalyst for better
PLOS is a non-profit organization on a mission to drive open science forward with measurable, meaningful change in research publishing, policy, and practice.
Building on a strong legacy of pioneering innovation, PLOS continues to be a catalyst, reimagining models to meet open science principles, removing barriers and promoting inclusion in knowledge creation and sharing, and publishing research outputs that enable everyone to learn from, reuse and build upon scientific knowledge.
We believe in a better future where science is open to all, for all
Researchers openly share all important research outputs and receive recognition for the value of these contributions to science and society.
Knowledge creation is faster and more efficient as outputs are shared and reusable, enabling scrutiny, corrections, collaboration resulting in time gains and avoiding waste.
Diverse perspectives help make research questions relevant and results trustworthy to diverse communities and society as a whole.
Equitable, sustainable models ensure fair participation and access to knowledge for both the producers and consumers of research and embrace diversity of communities of practice.
A catalytic legacy
PLOS was founded and built to advance science by transforming how scientific knowledge is shared and accessed. We have a history of challenging orthodoxy, harnessing under-appreciated trends, and addressing unarticulated needs.Our foundational commitments to effecting positive change are enduring and unwavering:
To accelerate innovation, acting in partnership with others in the ecosystem, to move us closer to our vision of how scientific communications should work.
To be a catalytic publisher, focusing on openness throughout the research cycle and providing distinctive value to significant target markets of researchers, achieving a level of success that anchors our broader influence and encourages adoption of new practices by others.
To steadily increase the resources marshalled behind our vision over time, recognizing that achieving our ultimate goals will require more capital, more influence and more capabilities of many kinds than we or any actor possess today.
An exciting new era
In 2025 and beyond, we will build on our legacy with a revitalized brand with our vision and mission at the center.

A focus on principles, not profits
We exist to serve the research enterprise which means our priorities are based on the needs of scholars, librarians, funders, and institutional leaders, not shareholders. We will not waste public money and will do everything we can to ensure our services are valuable and cost effective. Business models are structured to make our journals sustainable, and any surplus revenue goes toward furthering our open science mission.
