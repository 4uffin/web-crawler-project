Open Science and Editorial Policy
Our editorial and open science policies ensure the quality of everything we publish
PLOS journals are committed to publishing research that is robust, reliable, and accessible to all. Underpinning our commitment are our editorial and open science policies which set high standards for the research we publish.The policies outlined below apply to all PLOS journals to ensure best practices in research reporting, safeguard research integrity, and enhance transparency. Some journals may have additional policies or requirements not outlined here. Authors, editors, and reviewers should consult the relevant PLOS journal policy page for specific detail.
Editorial policy
We set high standards for quality, ethics and research integrity. Our editorial policies ensure everything we publish meets a high bar for trustworthiness and academic rigor.
Best practices in research reporting​
PLOS has worked with experts around the world in developing policies which set high international standards and best practices for research reporting of all study types across all fields of research.Learn more about our research reporting policies including:Ethical oversightInclusivity in global researchReporting research protocolsReporting guidance for specific research resources and study typesStatistical reportingTerritorial descriptions
Human subjects research​
We require all research involving human participants to meet international ethics standards outlined in the Belmont report and Declaration of Helsinki. Human subjects research articles must report information on participant consent, ethics oversight, and clinical trial registration (where applicable). Articles must not include any information that would compromise participant anonymity unless the participant has provided specific permission.This policy also applies to studies involving human specimens or data, unless the study qualifies as exempt per applicable ethics committee regulations.Read our complete policies for human subjects research, including:Summary of requirementsPolicy enforcementAdherence to international ethics standardsCategorization of human participant groupsClinical trialsPatient privacy and informed consent for publicationCell lines
Animal research
We require all studies involving animal research to meet international standards and receive prior approval from the author’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) or equivalent ethics committee(s).View all of policies for animal subjects research, including:Research ethics and reporting requirementsReporting guidelinesNon-human primatesUnregulated animal researchPaleontology and archaeology researchPolicy enforcement
Competing Interest​
Competing interests may arise from financial, professional, or personal factors which may be perceived to interfere with the objective presentation and peer review of research. We require authors to declare potential competing interests at the time of submission of their research. Editors and reviewers must also declare competing interests prior to participating in the peer review process, and should decline invitations to evaluate manuscripts for which they have a potential competing interest.Learn more about our competing interests policy.
Disclosure of funding sources​
We require all authors to declare sources of funding for their research which is published as a Funding Statement in the metadata for each PLOS article.Read more about disclosure of funding sources including:What to declareFunding statementHow to declareFunding from tobacco companies
Complementary research​
All of our selective journals follow our Complementary Research Policy, which protects articles from being rejected for novelty within six months of complementary research appearing publicly as an article or preprint.Learn more about our Complementary Research Policy.
Ethical publishing practice​
PLOS is a member of the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) and abides by the COPE Code of Conduct and best practices. We investigate all concerns raised about PLOS submissions or publications and will protect the confidentiality of those who raise ethics or integrity concerns, where possible.All authors, editors, and reviewers are expected to be aware of and comply with PLOS policies that support research integrity.See the full detail of our ethical publishing policies, including:Standard practices in addressing concerns about PLOS contentEthical peer review (including the use of AI tools in peer review)PlagiarismConfidentialityAnonymitySubmission and publication of related studiesManipulation of the publication processConcerns about data or figuresArtificial intelligence tools and technologiesBiosecurity and dual use research of concernStandards for professional conduct
Authorship​
PLOS Medicine follows the ICMJE authorship guidelines, and all other PLOS journals follow the authorship guidelines discussed in McNutt et al. (2018) as well as the ICMJE guidelines on group authorship. We expect authors to ensure all contributions to research are accurately reported and acknowledged according to the CRediT Taxonomy.Read more about our authorship guidelines including:Authorship requirementsGroup authorshipAuthor contributionsAcknowledgmentsCorresponding author responsibilitiesProfessional medical writersAuthorship changesAuthor identificationEditor and reviewer requirements
Editorial Notes, Corrections, Expressions of Concern, and Retractions​
PLOS takes post-publication action on our articles as needed to uphold the integrity and validity of PLOS content. Post-publication editorial decisions are based on our assessment of the issues raised, information received, and how case details align with COPE guidance, PLOS policies, and/or the journal’s publication criteria.We publish four types of post-publication notes (Editorial Notes, Corrections, Expressions of Concern, and Retractions) to address substantial editorial updates, errors, or concerns. See the full policy for details.Explore all post-publication notes including:Editorial NotesCorrectionsExpressions of ConcernRetractionsPublication of previously retracted workRemoval of PLOS contentAppeals of post-publication decisions
Licenses and copyright ​
All PLOS content is published under a CC-BY license meaning it is accessible for anyone to read, cite, reuse, and share with attribution.We require authors to provide proof that content contained in their article which may be owned by someone else is licensed appropriately to meet this same level of transparency and is properly attributed.Learn more about our licenses and copyright policies including:Reuse of PLOS article contentContent owned by someone elseUsing article content previously published in another journalMapsRemoval of content used without clear rightsTrademarks and symbolsGiving proper attribution for use of content
Open Science policies
Our open science policies ensure research and research artifacts are shared as transparently as possible to enhance understanding, reproducibility, and utility to the broader scholarly community.
Data availability​
Our Data Availability Policy requires authors to make all data necessary to replicate their study’s findings publicly available without restriction at the time of publication. When specific legal or ethical restrictions prohibit public sharing of a data set, authors must explain the restrictions in the article’s Data Availability Statement and indicate where the data is located and how others may obtain access.Read more about our Data Availability Policy
Materials, software and code sharing
We expect authors to make relevant materials, software, and code that underpins their research findings available without restrictions upon publication of their work to enhance transparency, validation and reproducibility.Get the details on our policies for materials, software and code sharing
