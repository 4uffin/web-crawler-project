Redefining publishing
PLOS, supported by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation & Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, is undertaking an important new initiative
PLOS believes in a better future where science is open to all, for all. We are redefining publishing by demonstrating that new solutions are feasible and deliver tangible benefits for the entire research enterprise.PLOS’s continued dedication to advancing open science, coupled with its groundbreaking innovation in publishing business models, reinforces its commitment to fostering research communication that is sustainable, accessible, and impactful for all. With support from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, our pioneering 18 month research and design project addresses two significant barriers in open science:
Lack of recognition for contributions beyond the article—such as data and code.Lack of affordability—current article processing charges (APCs) prevent many researchers from participating in open access.
Real contributions happen before and beyond the article

A future beyond the article and the APC
Why we must go Beyond the Article
Despite the digital revolution, the journal article remains the central measure of academic merit, often undervaluing key research outputs such as data and code. Researchers who embrace open science principles and share these resources receive little recognition, creating a gap in the current system. While journal articles remain a critical part of scientific communication, their status as the primary output of merit leads to a narrow evaluation of scientific contributions, stifling innovation, collaboration, and transparency.Building on its leadership in open access publishing PLOS is committed to designing a new model of research publication that recognizes all forms of scholarly contribution to create a more inclusive and equitable system for assessing scientific work.
Why we must go Beyond the APC
Article processing charges (APC), introduced early in the open access movement to cover publishing costs, create financial barriers that restrict who can publish research—especially those in resource-limited settings, early career scientists and underfunded fields. They shift focus away from other critical elements of research, including data, methods, and software and by tying publication opportunities to financial resources, APCs reduce inclusivity and transparency, ultimately slowing scientific progress and collaboration.PLOS will develop an equitable, non ‘APC’ business model designed to foster a more inclusive, transparent, and collaborative system, while upholding the core principles of the open science ecosystem.
Our strategy
Our initiative is grounded in the belief that publishing can accelerate systemic change: making open science the norm, supporting greater inclusion, increasing credit for a broader set of contributions, and making research more trustworthy and community-aligned.PLOS is pursuing three key strategies:
Knowledge stack design
PLOS will develop a new, integrated publishing solution that enhances the visibility and discoverability of non-article research outputs, including data and code. The goal is to ensure that these contributions are recognized alongside traditional articles without disrupting the current publishing workflow. We will work with repositories and indexing services to ensure that these outputs are hosted in the best possible venues, making them easily accessible and reusable.Upon completion, we will have a fully tested, scalable solution design that can integrate with the existing digital infrastructure and publishing processes, helping researchers showcase their complete body of work.
Business models
PLOS will conduct a comprehensive economic analysis to explore how transitioning to a digital knowledge stack impacts funding flows across different global markets. Grounded in equity and price transparency, our goal is to develop a sustainable, non-APC business model for all research outputs in collaboration with funders, libraries, and scientific institutions.This business model aims to be a catalyst for a global shift away from APCs, enabling greater participation in open science and paving the way toward long-term sustainability.
Building solutions with our communities
Driving meaningful change in open science requires collaboration across the research ecosystem. We are committed to working closely with a diverse array of stakeholders—researchers, funders, institutional leaders, and librarians—to ensure that their needs and voices are central to the development and implementation of this initiative.By engaging directly with our communities, PLOS will ensure that the solutions we build are inclusive, effective, and widely adopted.
Get involved. PLOS is seeking partners, contributors, and champions to shape the future of open science.
