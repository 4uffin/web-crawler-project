PLOS Genetics publishes research related to genetics and genomics across the full breadth of this field, from microbes to humans and from basic science to translational approaches. We welcome cross-disciplinary research that provides new insights and substantially advances our understanding of biological principles and processes. We act as a forum for practicing scientists by publishing high-quality, peer-reviewed research, reviews and opinion articles.
PLOS One
PLOS One accepts research in over two hundred subject areas across science, engineering, medicine, and the related social sciences and humanities. We evaluate research on the basis of scientific validity, strong methodology, and high ethical standards, selecting for research that contributes to academic knowledge. We encourage inter-and multidisciplinary studies, and accept a range of submissions from primary research to protocols and systematic reviews, including research with negative or null results.
PLOS Pathogens
PLOS Pathogens publishes ground-breaking research on pathogen biology and host-pathogen interactions across all life forms. From fundamental discovery through to translational, applied and clinical research we uphold the highest standards of quality,  ethics, integrity, and editorial judgment through fair and transparent peer review. Our rigorous selection process ensures that only impactful and high-quality research is published. We are committed to advancing open science and a diverse and inclusive culture that represents our global community and engages with international experts as authors, editors, and reviewers from across the world.
Health science
PLOS Complex Systems
PLOS Complex Systems brings together researchers across disciplines, providing a platform for theoretical, modeling, and applied research that advances our understanding of complex systems. The journal encompasses diverse topics—from chaotic systems and networks to risk modeling, systems biology, and economics—emphasizing methodological rigor and broad community impact.
PLOS Digital Health
PLOS Digital Health is a journal for democratizing healthcare in the interdisciplinary and digital age. We encourage excellent research from healthcare professionals, policy makers, and other stakeholders across digital health that embraces open code and data sharing to improve health outcomes for patients. We empower researchers to ensure that progress and technology in this rapidly-changing field is discoverable, accessible, and reproducible.
PLOS Global Public Health
PLOS Global Public Health makes interdisciplinary research of the highest ethical and methodological rigor visible and accessible to health professionals, policy-makers, and local communities, prioritizing diversity, equity, and inclusion in public health research. We welcome qualitative and quantitative primary research in a range of topics from maternal and child health, global health security, and evidence use and policy, to infectious and non-communicable diseases and environmental health.
PLOS Medicine
PLOS Medicine publishes high-impact research that transforms healthcare delivery, shapes policy, and advances clinical understanding. Our scope encompasses critical challenges in global health—from major diseases to health equity and the social determinants of health—with emphasis on work that bridges research and real-world implementation. The journal serves as a trusted platform where rigorous methodology meets practical impact, connecting researchers, healthcare professionals, and policymakers via collaborative editorial support to drive meaningful improvements in global health outcomes.
PLOS Mental Health
PLOS Mental Health is a global, multidisciplinary journal that brings together research aimed at improving the mental health and well-being of all people around the world. Works published will range from academic and clinical research, to submissions on technology to support improved mental health, and policy and governance. Topics include, but are not restricted to, lived experience, community mental health, public mental health and policy, socio-economic and environmental impacts, psychiatry and occupational mental health.
PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases
PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases covers the epidemiology, pathology, treatment, prevention and control of neglected tropical diseases, defined as poverty-promoting infectious diseases that primarily occur in rural areas and poor urban areas of low-income and middle-income countries. Research in all aspects of these diseases is welcome, from clinical features to vector biology, public health, social sciences and policy.
