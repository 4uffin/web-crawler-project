Investigating questions surrounding open science and scholarly communications with a view to building better solutions
Our mission is to help lead a transformation in research communication. Success relies in part on developing a deeper understanding of our scholarly publishing system, and the factors that shape it, so we can better understand community needs, motivations, and behaviors.Like the researchers who publish in our journals, PLOS prioritizes openness by posting, publishing
