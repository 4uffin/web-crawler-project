Explore terrestrial ecosystems research
Research on this topic addresses the structure, function, and biodiversity of terrestrial ecosystems across the globe, in environments ranging from deserts to rain forests. Our publications on terrestrial ecosystems cover areas including community and population ecology, ecosystem functions and services, and the management of land and natural resources.They include studies that make use of technologies such as remote sensing, and that contribute to evidence-based conservation of species and ecosystems. They also explore the impacts of pressures such as habitat destruction, invasions, and changes in land use and climate.
