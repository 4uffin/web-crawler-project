Cancer research has the potential to transform and save lives by developing safe and effective ways to prevent, detect, diagnose, treat and ultimately cure the spectrum of diseases called cancer.PLOS has been instrumental in advancing the understanding of cancer by providing an open platform for researchers to share their findings and facilitating the rapid dissemination of crucial information related to cancer biology, prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and survivorship.PLOS journals not only cover a wide range of topics within cancer research, including tumor biology, immunotherapy, precision medicine, and clinical trials, but also encourage transparency and reproducibility in scientific research, essential principles in cancer research to ensure the validity and reliability of findings.
