Explore population and aging research
Advances in translational scientific research and modern medicine have contributed to significant improvements in life expectancy across the globe. The global population of >60-year-olds is predicted to reach 1.4 billion by 2030 and 2.1 billion by 2050. Improved access to diagnostics and therapeutics means that people are increasingly living with one or more chronic health conditions.This challenges health and social care systems around the world, which PLOS addresses through a diverse selection of open access population and aging research ranging, from the biology of normal aging, to dementia research, to the health and economic impacts of changing demographics.
