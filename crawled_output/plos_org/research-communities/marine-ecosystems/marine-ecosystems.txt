Explore marine ecosystems research
We publish research that addresses the biological diversity of marine ecosystems, from the familiar to the little-explored. This includes ecological functions and processes in environments ranging from coral reefs to seagrass meadows; from estuaries to the benthic zone. Our publications also examine ecosystem services and conservation approaches, highlighting the ecological impacts of global change, including ocean acidification, marine heatwaves, overfishing, and pollution.
