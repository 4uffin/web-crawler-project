research
Whether in more traditional clinical informatics settings or ground-breaking artificial intelligence (AI) and large language modelling (LLM) research, PLOS’ open access digital health research promotes the responsible and equitable utilization of new tools and technologies for global benefit.These tools present rich opportunities to improve care in marginalized communities, opening new paths to patient-reported outcomes and greater collaborative engagement with healthcare providers. They must be accessible to all.As AI becomes increasingly ubiquitous in clinical settings, maintaining our high research integrity and publication ethics is crucial for identifying potential sources of bias. This helps ensure the publication of reliable digital health research to both support physician decision-making and safeguard individuals seeking greater agency over their welfare through innovative apps or programs.
