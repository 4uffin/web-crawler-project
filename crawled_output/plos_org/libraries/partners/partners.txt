PLOS is a non-profit organization on a mission to drive open science forward with measurable, meaningful change in research publishing, policy, and practice.
Building on a strong legacy of pioneering innovation, PLOS continues to be a catalyst, reimagining models to meet open science principles, removing barriers and promoting inclusion in knowledge creation and sharing, and publishing research outputs that enable everyone to learn from, reuse and build upon scientific knowledge.
We believe in a better future where science is open to all, for all.

Institutional partners
Open access is not truly open without equitable opportunities to publish. To support authors from diverse research communities, funding backgrounds, and institutional requirements, all PLOS journals offer APC-alternative business agreements through institutional partnerships. Our various partnership agreements–Flat Fee, Global Equity, and Community Action Publishing –are tailored to the publication needs and regional economies of researchers and institutions in that field.
Institutions listed below have partnered with PLOS in one or more agreements to make open access more accessible to their authors. If you would like to submit to a journal that is not listed for your institution, please let us know the details and we’ll contact your librarian.
Learn more about our agreements
PLOS offers several, diverse partnership agreements for institutions to contribute to or eliminate open access publication fees at PLOS journals. To see if your institution already provides publication support at your preferred journal, and to view any eligibility restrictions, search for your institution’s name below, or filter by journal title.If you’re a librarian and have questions about your institutional account or partnership opportunities at PLOS, please contact PLOS directly at InstitutionalAccounts@plos.org.

Open Access Policy
Institutional agreements
Direct-billing: Institutions handle individual author payments through a debit or monthly invoice. Under this agreements, fee support is subject to the institution’s internal funding policies. Certain restrictions may be noted under the institution’s name below, but we encourage authors to check their institution’s open access policy, or contact their institution for questions on funding eligibility. For publication fees in which the institution does not accept responsibility per their review, PLOS will invoice the authors individually.Flat Fees: Institutions have partnered with PLOS to eliminate or significantly reduce their researchers’ publication expenses through an annual flat fee. Existing Flat Fee agreements apply to all publications in PLOS Complex Systems, PLOS Computational Biology, PLOS Digital Health, PLOS Genetics, PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases, PLOS One and PLOS Pathogens through an annual flat fee. At their discretion, institutions may choose to set an author surcharge for each publication. Any applicable surcharge will be noted under the institution’s name below.Community Action Publishing: Our community-supported, open access agreement for PLOS Biology and PLOS Medicine covers the cost of highly-selective publishing through equitable distribution amongst institutions whose authors publish in these journals. As a member of the collective for either PLOS Biology, PLOS Medicine, or PLOS Sustainability and Transformation institutions’ corresponding authors will not face any publication fees at that journal. A 25% discount will also be applied to publication fees for manuscripts where one or more of the contributing authors are members, but the corresponding author is not.Global Equity: Our new Global Equity agreement empowers institutions in every region of the world to provide unlimited publication support for their authors through a single, annual fee that is equitable, and affordable. Institutions can choose to participate in this agreement for PLOS Climate, PLOS Global Public Health, PLOS Mental Health and/or PLOS Water, ensuring their authors never face publication fees at that journal. Participation fees are based on each institution’s historical research output in the field and are reflective of their regional economy according to their country’s World Bank lending tier.
