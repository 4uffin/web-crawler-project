Institutional agreements
We offer several institutional agreements tailored for specific journals in order to address different challenges such as the high-cost of selective publishing and regional economic disparities. We work with institutions to find the right solution for their researchers’ publication needs and advance research that is robust, reliable, and accessible to all.
Find the institutional agreement that is right for you
Flat Fee
Institutions pay an annual flat fee based on historical publication activity and provide their authors unlimited opportunities to publish in PLOS Complex Systems, PLOS Computational Biology, PLOS Digital Health, PLOS Genetics, PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases, PLOS Pathogens, and PLOS One, at no cost to the authors.
Community Action Publishing
Our Community Action Publishing (CAP) agreement equitably distributes the cost of highly selective open access publishing amongst institutions whose authors publish in these journals in order to eliminate APCs.Institutions can choose to participate in this agreement for PLOS Biology, PLOS Medicine, or PLOS Sustainability and Transformation, ensuring their authors never face publication fees at that journal.
Global Equity
Our Global Equity agreement enables institutions in every region of the world to eliminate publication fees (APCs) for authors publishing in select PLOS journals through a single, annual fee that is equitable, and affordable.Institutions can choose to participate in this agreement for PLOS Climate, PLOS Global Public Health, PLOS Mental Health and/or PLOS Water, ensuring their authors never face publication fees at that journal. Participation fees are based on each institution’s historical research output in the field and are reflective of their regional economy according to their country’s World Bank lending tier.
APCs for institutions
For institutions who prefer to administer individual author payments, our debit or monthly invoice Institutional Accounts help eliminate reimbursement protocols, consolidate author invoices, and streamline author payment communications. Discounts are available for single-debit accounts for consortia.
