Support your authors in publishing in their research while helping to make open access publishing more accessible, equitable and sustainable.
To ensure publication fees are never a barrier to authors who want to make their work open, we’re working with funders and institutions to reimagine open access agreements that are transparent and distribute publication costs more equitably. Our agreements reflect the diversity of researchers’ publication needs as well as the institutions who support them.
