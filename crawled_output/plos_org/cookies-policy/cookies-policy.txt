Cookies and other tracking technologiesBackgroundPLOS and our third-party partners, such as analytics and advertising partners, use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect certain information.  Cookies and other tracking technologies are used to distinguish you from other users on the PLOS website. This helps us provide you with a good experience when you browse our website and allows us to improve our site, analyze the use of our site, and deliver targeted advertising based on your browsing history on our site and other websites.  A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers that are stored on your device.PLOS uses both
first party and
third-party cookies. First party cookies are served directly by us to your computer or device. Third-party cookies are served by a third party on our behalf. Cookies can be “persistent” or “session” based. Persistent cookies remain on your device after your browser is closed. Session cookies are deleted automatically once your browser is closed. PLOS uses both persistent and session cookies.We also use technologies that are similar to cookies, such as tags and pixels. Tags are small portions of code which we use on the PLOS website to learn whether you have clicked on certain web content. A pixel is a similar type of technology used on the PLOS website for the purpose of counting the number of views for each of its published articles. Pixels are sent directly to our servers or to the third-party platform which has provided the pixel.For the rest of this policy, “cookies” refer to both cookies and other tracking technologies.
