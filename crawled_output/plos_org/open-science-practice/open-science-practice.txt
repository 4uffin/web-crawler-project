Open Science Practice
We work with diverse communities to promote the adoption of open science practices across disciplines, geographies, and career stages. To create new pathways to open science, we actively engage with stakeholders across the scholarly community with knowledge sharing, co-creation, and partnership.
Open science research
We conduct original research to provide a deeper understanding of open science practice, our broader scholarly publishing system, and the factors that shape them. Like the researchers who publish in our journals, we share what we learn so we can collectively build better solutions.
Open Science Indicators (OSI)
Open Science Indicators (OSIs) are tools developed by us in collaboration with DataSeer to measure open science behaviors such as preprint posting, data-sharing, and code-sharing in a standardized way.OSIs are a first-of-its-kind tool for measuring open science practices in the published literature, at scale. Our work has influenced other members of the scholarly community who now use OSIs to understand trends in their institution; to explore markers of research integrity, and to benchmark new tools for monitoring open science.

Open science policies
We’re committed to improving how research is discovered, assessed and recognized for its academic rigor, transparency, and utility to the broader scholarly community.In addition to leading editorial policies supporting ethics and research integrity, our authors must adhere to the following policies which ensure research is accessible, verifiable, and reproducible:Data Availability PolicyMaterials, software, and code sharingOpen Code Policy
