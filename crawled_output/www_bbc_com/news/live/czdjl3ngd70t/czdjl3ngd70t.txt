The 77th Emmy Awards have just wrapped up.It was a big night for shows like Adolescence, The Studio and The Pitt, which took home their fair share of awards. Some of the standout moments for us:
Owen Cooper, 15, became the youngest ever male Emmy winner for his performance in Adolescence. The show finished with six awards tonight
The Pitt taking out the final two big awards for best actor and best drama series
We saw reunions of several beloved casts from shows like Gilmore Girls and Law and Order Special Victims Unit
Ultimately, Bargatze ended up donating $350,000 to charity despite threats to cut money over the length of winning speeches. The show may be over but stick with us, we're still chatting with stars backstage and will bring you all the latest news.

As the categories get bigger, the speeches are getting longer. And as host Nate Bargatze promised, the amount he has to donate to charity has been ticking down with each speech that runs too long. Somehow, it's now in the negatives. "I think I actually made money," he says.

Image source, Getty ImagesI'm speaking to Last Week Tonight's John Oliver backstage, where he's said that he is hoping The Late Show's Stephen Colbert wins the Emmy for Outstanding Host. "I think we all want Colbert to win. I really hope that happens," says Oliver, adding that he would be upset if he didn't. He's not the only one in the industry that has rallied around Colbert. Host Jimmy Kimmel had earlier taken out a billboard urging voters to support Colbert's show, rather than his own programme. In July, CBS announced it was cancelling Colbert's long-running talk show, citing financial reasons. The decision came just days after Colbert criticised a settlement between CBS' parent company - Paramount Global - and President Trump, causing some Democrats and political commentators to ask if it could have been political.Colbert has already previously won nine Emmys - and as we reported earlier, also won the award for outstanding talk series.

"And when we were developing this show, we wanted to talk about toxic masculinity and incel culture and all those things that our children are going through right now. "And so we thought, you know, you'll do OK in the UK. And then when it came out, and it was just every single day or week, it's just something else. "So my mind is completely blown, and I'm incredibly proud of what we've achieved and what everyone did. When everybody is on the same page, on the same train, going in the same direction on the project, then it's it's magical, that's all I can say. And it was that from day one."
