To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.This video can not be playedMedia caption, Moment Owen Cooper becomes youngest ever male Emmy winnerWith his performance in Netflix's hard-hitting drama Adolescence, Owen Cooper, 15, has become the youngest ever male Emmy winner.The Warrington-born actor was only 14 when the four-part British series was filmed.Adolescence shows the aftermath of the stabbing of a teenage girl, with a 13-year-old boy from her school arrested for her murder. But what won it sweeping critical acclaim was its exploration of social media-fuelled misogyny among teenage boys.And Cooper, who plays the young suspect Jamie, delivers what critics described as an "astonishing" and "truly remarkable performance".In a Netflix interview, casting director Shaheen Baig recalled seeing Owen's improvised tape and thinking: "He looks great on camera, but also his improv was really smart. It felt very natural."Cooper first became interested in acting at around the age of 10. He attended weekly acting classes for two years in Didsbury, Manchester - though until Adolescence he did not have any TV or film credits to his name.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Cooper with his parents, Noreen and Andy"I asked my mum and dad if I could start going to drama classes, and I think they were a bit shocked by it because I've always wanted to become a footballer," he said in a Netflix interview.Read more about Owen Cooper's journey here.

inspire this generation" to do that work."And that was the audience we played the show for. That was the first audience that responded with and it was their word of mouth."Joe Sachs, the show's writer and producer, says "we hear time and time again emergency workers saying 'we feel seen'"."There are people who've had post-traumatic stress from Covid who never realised it, who said, 'Wow, I'm getting help now because of you,'" he says.

As the categories get bigger, the speeches are getting longer. And as host Nate Bargatze promised, the amount he has to donate to charity has been ticking down with each speech that runs too long. Somehow, it's now in the negatives. "I think I actually made money," he says.

Image source, Getty ImagesI'm speaking to Last Week Tonight's John Oliver backstage, where he's said that he is hoping The Late Show's Stephen Colbert wins the Emmy for Outstanding Host. "I think we all want Colbert to win. I really hope that happens," says Oliver, adding that he would be upset if he didn't. He's not the only one in the industry that has rallied around Colbert. Host Jimmy Kimmel had earlier taken out a billboard urging voters to support Colbert's show, rather than his own programme. In July, CBS announced it was cancelling Colbert's long-running talk show, citing financial reasons. The decision came just days after Colbert criticised a settlement between CBS' parent company - Paramount Global - and President Trump, causing some Democrats and political commentators to ask if it could have been political.Colbert has already previously won nine Emmys - and as we reported earlier, also won the award for outstanding talk series.

Some long speeches have caused Bargatze original donation count to nearly halve from $100,000 to $52,000."The in memoriam ran a little long," the host said, clarifying multiple times that he was joking.Nate is adding money to the charity pot for short speeches, and taking cash away when award winners speak for too long.
