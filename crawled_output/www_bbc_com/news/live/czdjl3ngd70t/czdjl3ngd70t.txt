"And when we were developing this show, we wanted to talk about toxic masculinity and incel culture and all those things that our children are going through right now. "And so we thought, you know, you'll do OK in the UK. And then when it came out, and it was just every single day or week, it's just something else. "So my mind is completely blown, and I'm incredibly proud of what we've achieved and what everyone did. When everybody is on the same page, on the same train, going in the same direction on the project, then it's it's magical, that's all I can say. And it was that from day one."
