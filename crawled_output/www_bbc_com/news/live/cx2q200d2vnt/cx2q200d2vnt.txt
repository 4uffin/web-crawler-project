Image source, Getty ImagesThe opening day of President Trump's second state visit to the UK has boasted a packed itinerary - complete with a carriage procession, a Red Arrows flypast and even a new Transatlantic cocktail.Being the first president to receive an invitation for a second state visit to the UK was a "singular privilege", he said - the momentous nature of the trip did not seem to be lost on the US president. Calling it one of the "highest honours" of his life, Trump joked he hoped it will be the last time someone is invited twice.In his speech at the state banquet, he paid tribute to the relationship the two countries enjoy."The word special does not begin to do it justice," he told the 160 attendees.The King, in his turn, spoke of today's events as a renewal of the UK-US bond - referencing the "unshakeable trust in our friendship" and the "shared commitment to independence and liberty".Earlier in the day, Trump used the occasion to pay his respects to the late Queen Elizabeth II, laying a wreath at her tomb in a private moment away from cameras.The president and the King now sit side-by-side at a banquet table that took a week to put together - flanked by members of the Royal Family and the US administration.We will be pausing our live coverage for the day, but Trump's visit continues tomorrow when his focus turns to the political domain. He'll be sitting down with Prime Minister Keir Starmer and is also expected to meet leader of the opposition Kemi Badenoch.Until then, we've got more on today's wardrobe choices, an overview of what tonight's banquet looks like and highlights of the speeches that the King and Trump made a short while ago.

Image source, Getty ImagesFor much of today, Americans - and many US TV networks - have been captivated by the display put on for President Donald Trump in Windsor today. Knowing I work for the BBC, several acquaintances and contacts have messaged me throughout the morning. What they said, I thought, was quite indicative of what many Americans were thinking. "That was an incredible display," one government worker told me. "That's so much more than anything we do." Another contact, a young female veteran of the Army, said the Beating the Retreat and flypast were "infinitely better" than the parade held to celebrate the US Army's 250th birthday in June - on Trump's birthday. "That's how these things should be done," she added, noting that state visits to the US often go completely unnoticed by the wider public. On the other hand, Trump's visit to the UK comes at a time in which there are many ongoing domestic issues in the US that are gripping the attention of the country - ranging from the aftermath of Charlie Kirk's assassination to FBI Director Kash Patel's hearing on Capitol Hill and battles over the US healthcare system. "I haven't been watching that, at all," one left-leaning friend told me when I asked about Trump's visit. "We've got stuff of our own to deal with right now." Out of curiosity, I just flipped through US news channels, and found that, at least after today's events in the UK wrapped up, most had reverted back to focusing on domestic politics.

Yellow! Strapless! And a baby pink belt!Gone was the hat, so for the first time today, we saw her full face. She wore her hair down, and completed the look with sparkling, dangly earrings.The Prince of Wales was decked out in formal regalia and his orders, and wore an elegant Windsor tail coat.And the Queen attended the banquet in a royal blue silk marocain embroidered dress by Fiona Clare, a sapphire and diamond tiara, and the King's Family Order.Image source, Getty Images

This was President Trump like we rarely see him - sticking to a script, restrained - with no meandering diversions. As he heaped praise on his host, he struck a sombre tone. There were a few of his characteristic self congratulatory Trump moments -
he said he'd made America "the hottest country in the world" since he returned to office, and when he joked about how he hoped he'd be the only president to get two state visits, he even raised a few laughs.

The King's speech made an unexpected reference to an old news story from the 1970s.On a trip to the White House under the presidency of Richard Nixon the press had speculated on whether the then young bachelor Prince Charles was going to be romantically involved with the president's daughter."Had the media succeeded in the 1970s in their own attempt at deepening the special relationship, I myself might have been married off within the Nixon family!" he tells the banquet.
