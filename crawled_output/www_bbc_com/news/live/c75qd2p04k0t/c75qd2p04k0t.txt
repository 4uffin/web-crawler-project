The first migrant deportation flights under the UK's new âone in, one outâ deal with France are expected to begin this week. The scheme aims to deter asylum seekers from crossing the English Channel in small boats.Several dozen migrants detained in Dover last month are set to be the first returned to France, with the UK accepting an equal number of asylum seekers who have not tried to cross.Since the deal came into force in early August, 5,590 people have been detected crossing in small boats, which is 8% higher than the same period last year.So far this year there have been record 31,026 crossings, which is 38% higher than the same period last year.

Weâre continuing to verify footage emerging from Gaza City over the weekend after the Israeli air force destroyed more tower blocks and other buildings.Yesterday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) gave four evacuation notices for prominent high-rise buildings. All four were later destroyed and we have verified the footage.
An separate evacuation notice was issued on Saturday and that building was flattened the same day. The picture below is from a video showing the moment one of the buildings, Al-Kawthar Tower, was bombed.Image source, XThe IDF has been targeting tall buildings across Gaza City for more than a week now, but itâs not just the multi-storeys highlighted on social media being hit. Many of the videos weâve verified show the destruction of other buildings, as well as vehicles.On Friday the IDF said its airstrikes had targeted âover 500 objectivesâ, external in Gaza City. It said it was destroying âtowers converted into military infrastructureâ as well as âreconnaissance and sniper positions, buildings containing operational tunnel openings, weapons warehouses, and other terrorist infrastructureâ. It did not provide any evidence to support these claims.Meanwhile, thousands of displaced people are leaving Gaza and heading south, where new encampments are being set up.Weâll bring you more on all of this throughout the day, and weâll continue to monitor for new developments.

Weâre mapping the destruction
of buildings in Gaza City, including tower blocks, following attacks carried
out by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) over the weekend. Our open-source journalists
are also monitoring the latest IDF-issued evacuation orders and the build-up of
tents to accommodate displaced Gazans. We hope to bring you the latest
satellite images shortly. In the UK, Reform leader
Nigel Farage is holding a press conference later this morning, which the
fact-checking team will be following.The first deportation flights
following the UK-France "one in, one out" deal reached in July are expected this week.
Weâre looking at how many people have been detected crossing in small boats
