He criticised Donald Trump's remarks towards his political opponents and pointed to previous Republican presidents who, he said, emphasised national unity in moments of high tension, US media report.In response, the White House called Obama the "architect of modern political division".Kirk, 31, died of a single gunshot wound while speaking at Utah Valley University in Orem on 10 September.On Tuesday, Tyler Robinson, 22, was formally charged with Kirk's murder, weapons offences and other charges. Prosecutors said they would seek the death penalty.Utah County Attorney Jeffrey Gray said Robinson had sent text messages which allegedly said he shot Kirk because he "had enough of his hatred".Before Robinson was captured, top Trump allies pinned blame for the killing on left-wing activists and rhetoric from Democratic lawmakers and their supporters.Attorney General Pam Bondi has suggested that the administration will crack down on "hate speech" – although there is no specific US hate speech law. Vice-President JD Vance has led calls to expose people who celebrated or condoned Kirk's killing or were critical of him after his slaying."Call them out, and hell, call their employer," Vance said as he guest-hosted Kirk's podcast.Speaking in Erie, Pennsylvania, Obama said: "I think at moments like this, when tensions are high, then part of the job of the president is to pull people together." He urged Americans to "respect other people's right to say things that we profoundly disagree with".Obama praised Utah Governor Spencer Cox, a conservative Republican who he said had shown "that it is possible for us to disagree while abiding by a basic code of how we should engage in public debate".He also endorsed the response of Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, whose official residence was firebombed earlier this year in what police called a targeted attack.The former president contrasted those reactions with comments made by Trump and his allies.Obama said that he did not use a 2015 mass shooting by a white supremacist at a black church in South Carolina to go after his political enemies, and pointed out that after the 11 September 2001 attacks, President George W Bush "explicitly went out of his way to say, 'We are not at war against Islam'.""And so when I hear not just our current president, but his aides, who have a history of calling political opponents 'vermin', enemies who need to be 'targeted,' that speaks to a broader problem that we have right now and something that we're going to have to grapple with, all of us," Obama told the crowd, according to reports.In a statement to the BBC, a White House spokesperson rejected the allegations and accused Obama of stoking division while he was president. "Obama used every opportunity to sow division and pit Americans against each other," the spokesperson said."His division has inspired generations of Democrats to slander their opponents as 'deplorables,' or 'fascists,' or 'Nazis.'"After leaving office, US presidents generally tend to temper criticism of their successors, however in recent months Obama has hit out at Trump's moves against universities and judges, and has also criticised Democratic party leaders for failing to push back harder against White House policies.Killing of Trump ally lays bare America's bloody and broken politicsReport those who celebrate Charlie Kirk death to employers, Vance saysDonald TrumpBarack ObamaUnited StatesRelatedUS prosecutor resigns after Trump says 'I want him out'Trump says Xi approves of TikTok deal as leaders plan South Korea meetingSenator Ted Cruz says US broadcast regulator acted like 'mafioso' on Jimmy Kimmel More from the BBC38 mins agoWhat does the FCC do - and can it revoke a TV network's licence?The suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's show has triggered concerns about the US communications regulator's power over TV networks. 38 mins ago50 mins agoSikh granny's arrest by US immigration sparks community angerHarjit Kaur, a 73-year-old who unsuccessfully applied for asylum, was arrested by immigration authorities last week.50 mins ago2 hrs ago'Jesus, Take the Wheel' songwriter Brett James dies in US plane crashFriends and co-artists remember the Grammy-winning writer as "a songwriting force of nature".2 hrs ago2 hrs agoUS vaccine panel no longer recommends Covid-19 jab to adultsThe panel has also changed its recommendation on the MMRV vaccine and delayed a vote on the hepatitis B jab.2 hrs ago5 hrs agoTrump adds $100,000 fee for skilled worker visa applicants"Train Americans," said the commerce secretary.
