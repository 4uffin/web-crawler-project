In March, Haidilao sought more than 23m yuan in losses, saying this took into account the amount it compensated customers over the incident.Last Friday, a Shanghai court found that the teenagers had infringed upon the companies' property rights as well as reputation through "acts of insult", noting that their actions contaminated tableware and "caused strong discomfort among the public".It also found that the teens' parents had "failed to fulfil their duty of guardianship" and ordered that they bear the compensation, state media reported. This includes 2m yuan for operational and reputational damage, 130,000 yuan to one of the caterers for tableware losses and cleaning expenses, and 70,000 yuan in legal costs.However the court ruled that any additional compensation Haidilao offered to its customers, beyond what they were billed, was a "voluntary business decision", and therefore should not be borne by the teenagers.Haidilao had offered to compensate more than 4,000 diners who visited the branch between 24 February - the date of their visit - and 8 March, both with a full refund and a cash compensation that is 10 times the amount they were billed.They also replaced all hotpot equipment and said they had conducted cleaning and disinfection works. Haidilao has expanded quickly since it opened its first restaurant in Jianyang in Sichuan province. It now operates more than 1,000 restaurants across the world.The company is known for its customer service and family-friendly atmosphere, where women can receive manicures and kids are treated to candy floss while waiting for a table.AsiaChinaRelatedControversial church leader denies bribing ex-South Korea first ladyFury over corruption and 'nepo babies' as floods paralyse PhilippinesTimor-Leste scraps plan to buy MPs free cars after protestsMore from the BBC16 hrs agoFlying cars crash into each other at Chinese air showFootage shared on social media shows burning wreckage on the ground after the mid-air collision.16 hrs ago17 hrs agoWhat tariffs has Trump announced and why?Trump's volatile trade policy has thrown the world economy into chaos, and put some US prices up. 17 hrs ago17 hrs agoNvidia boss 'disappointed' by reported China chip banJensen Huang said the US needs "to make sure that that people can access this technology from all over the world".17 hrs ago22 hrs agoUS tennis star sorry for 'offensive' comments on Chinese foodShe described the turtle and frog dishes as "crazy" and "wild", causing a social media storm.22 hrs ago2 days agoUS says 'framework' for TikTok ownership deal agreed with ChinaThe deal will pave the way to US ownership of the social media platform's American operations, according to the US treasury secretary.2 days agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
