He gave Trump 28 days to file an amended complaint.Trump signalled he would sue the New York Times earlier this week in a post on Truth Social, claiming the newspaper has been "allowed to freely lie, smear and defame me for far too long".A spokesperson for President Trump has said that he "will continue to hold the Fake News accountable through this powerhouse lawsuit against the New York Times," the newspaper reported, and added that his legal team will file an amended version to meet the judge's directions.In its own statement, the New York Times said it welcome's the judge's "quick ruling, which recognised that the complaint was a political document rather than a serious legal filing".The paper had said earlier this week that the lawsuit has "no merit.""It lacks any legitimate legal claims and instead is an attempt to stifle and discourage independent reporting," the newspaper said in a statement earlier this week. In his order on Friday, Judge Merryday said the lawsuit filed by Trump is "repetitive" and "superfluous", and contains "florid" allegations.The 85-page lawsuit was filed in federal court in Tampa earlier this week. It also names Penguin Random House LLC - the publisher of a book written by Times reporters last year - and accuses the newspaper of serving as a "mouthpiece" for Democrats.Judge Merryday wrote in his ruling that even if Trump's allegations were proven to be true, and even if the lawsuit were interpreted in a "generous and lenient" manner, the way it was written violates the rules of the court and is "decidedly improper and impermissible."Neither President Trump nor his lawyers have yet responded to Judge Merryday's decision.The lawsuit comes as the Trump administration has faced criticism for what opponents call a crackdown on media unfavourable to the president. On Thursday, the US president suggested some TV networks should have their broadcast licenses "taken away," after ABC suspended late-night TV host Jimmy Kimmel only hours following threats from the Trump administration.Kimmel's suspension came after he made comments about the Charlie Kirk murder suspect, saying Trump supporters had tried to "characterise this kid (the suspect) as anything other than one of them."Other late-night TV hosts backed the comic, with Stephen Colbert calling the removal of Kimmel "blatant censorship".MediaDonald TrumpUnited StatesRelatedExpletive messages shown in S4C court case documentsUS TV hosts back Kimmel as Trump threatens networksTrump says TV networks opposed to him should 'maybe' lose licenceMore from the BBC32 mins agoUS prosecutor resigns after Trump says 'I want him out'Erik Siebert was investigating accusations of mortgage fraud against Trump adversary Letitia James.32 mins ago51 mins agoWhat does the FCC do - and can it revoke a TV network's licence?The suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's show has triggered concerns about the US communications regulator's power over TV networks. 51 mins ago1 hr agoSikh granny's arrest by US immigration sparks community angerHarjit Kaur, a 73-year-old who unsuccessfully applied for asylum, was arrested by immigration authorities last week.1 hr ago1 hr agoTrump says Xi approves of TikTok deal as leaders plan South Korea meetingThe president hailed "progress" during a phone call with Xi and said that he also would travel to China next year.1 hr ago1 hr agoSenator Ted Cruz says US broadcast regulator acted like 'mafioso' on Jimmy Kimmel The Texas senator affected a mobster accent to criticise how ABC was pressed to take action on the late-night host.1 hr agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
