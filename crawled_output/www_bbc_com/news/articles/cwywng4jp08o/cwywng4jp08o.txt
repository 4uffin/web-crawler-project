The UK's Ministry of Defence has previously said it is co-operating with the Kenyan investigation into the case, which has caused outrage in the East African nation.The family of Ms Wanjiru, who left behind a young daughter, have long been fighting for justice.They live in Nanyuki, which is close to the British Army Training Unit Kenya (Batuk) - some 200km (125 miles) north of the capital, Nairobi.Ms Wanjiru's niece, Esther Njoki, told the BBC that the warrant was "a bitter-sweet moment", noting the extradition process could take time. The prosecution told the court that witnesses currently based in the UK would be made available for the trial, ensuring that it could proceed.The family's UK-based legal representative, Tessa Gregory, said it now called "upon the British government to do everything in its power to ensure that the accused can be extradited and face trial in Kenya as soon as possible".Agnes Wanjiru murder: Kenya family's anger over UK army 'cover-up'Kenyans sue the British army over fire at wildlife sanctuaryGetty Images/BBCGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.Follow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafricaBBC Africa podcastsFocus on AfricaThis Is AfricaKenyaAfricaRelatedShock as Kenyan lawyer killed in drive-by shooting in Nairobi'I fear for my sons': Mother awaits DNA results on remains linked to Kenya's starvation cultTourist pouring beer down elephant's trunk in Kenya sparks angerMore from the BBC6 hrs agoUS deportees sue Ghana over 'illegal' detentionDespite opposition to the deal, Ghana's president says 40 more deportees will arrive from the US.6 hrs ago8 hrs agoMalawi's parties warned not to prematurely declare election victoryThe parties of both President Lazarus Chakwera and his main rival, Peter Mutharika, say they won Tuesday's poll.8 hrs ago13 hrs agoTogo leader's sister-in-law arrested after calling for end to family ruleMarguerite Gnakadé has become a vocal critic of Togo's long-serving leader Faure Gnassingbé.13 hrs ago14 hrs agoMalawians await presidential poll result in vote dominated by economic woesIf no candidate wins more than half the votes, the top two contenders will head to a run-off.14 hrs ago19 hrs agoNew project to fight 'devastating' disease beginsThe University of Surrey says it is tackling schistosomiasis, a major public health issue. 19 hrs agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
