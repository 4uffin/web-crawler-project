Jordan condemned the incident and has launched an investigation.The Jordanian foreign ministry condemned the act of violence "as a violation of the law and a threat to the Kingdom's interests and its ability to deliver humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip".The ministry said 22 Jordanian aid trucks had crossed the bridge towards Gaza on Thursday as part of measures which had facilitated the passage of 8,664 aid trucks since the start of the war in Gaza.The attack was praised by the Palestinian armed group Hamas, which Israel is fighting in Gaza, as a response to "the daily crimes and massacres committed by the [Israeli] occupation against our Palestinian people".The incident comes one year after three Israeli men were shot dead in the same place by an attacker who the Israeli military identified as a Jordanian truck driver. The Allenby Bridge crossing, also known as the King Hussein Bridge, lies about halfway between Amman and Jerusalem and is the only official crossing point between the West Bank and Jordan.
