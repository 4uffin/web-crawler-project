In the absence of an interview, we will nevertheless continue to pursue any viable lines of inquiry."We can provide no further information while the investigation is ongoing."HandoutMadeleine McCann disappeared in 2007, then aged threeAlmost two decades since Madeleine's disappearance, it has become one of the highest-profile unsolved missing person cases in the world.Earlier this year, German prosecutors pointed to evidence suggesting Brückner may have been in the area when Madeleine disappeared.Elsewhere in June, Portuguese and German police conducted a fresh search of land in Lagos - between where the McCanns had been staying and addresses linked to Brückner, but this yielded no breakthroughs.PA MediaInvestigators have been searching scrubland and abandoned buildings in the latest searches for Madeleine McCannBrückner was not identified as a suspect in her disappearance until 2020.Due to differences in legal systems, German authorities suspect Brückner of murder in relation to Madeleine, while British police continue to treat her disappearance as a missing persons case.However, no charges have ever been brought against Brückner in the case of Madeleine, and the full details of the alleged evidence have never been released.In 2023, investigators carried out searches near the Barragem do Arade reservoir, about 30 miles from Praia da Luz.Brückner spent time in the Praia da Luz area between 2000 and 2017 and had photographs and videos of himself near the reservoir.In October last year, Brückner was cleared by a German court of unrelated sexual offences, alleged to have taken place in Portugal between 2000 and 2017.The funding given to the Met's investigation into Madeleine's disappearance, titled Operation Grange, has totalled more than £13.2m since 2011. A further £108,000 was secured from the government in April.More on this storyMadeleine McCann disappearance: A timelineHopes of closure fade as police wrap up Madeleine McCann search Madeleine McCann search goes on but is it 18 years too late?GermanyMadeleine McCann disappearancePortugalMetropolitan Police ServiceRelatedNI's missed chance 'a step in the right direction'Were Nagelsmann's NI comments 'disrespectful' or 'deflective'?Highlights: Germany beat NI with quick-fire doubleMore from the BBC13 hrs agoWe will never surrender our flag, Sir Keir Starmer saysThe prime minister said the flag represents "our diverse country" and he will not allow people to feel intimidated.13 hrs ago1 day agoMan charged over damage to London synagoguesThe 37-year-old man has been charged with racially or religiously aggravated criminal damage, the Met Police said.1 day ago2 days agoEight Met Police officers suspended after BBC investigationThe accusations include excessive use of force, discriminatory and misogynistic comments. 2 days ago2 days ago'I can't change people's opinions of me' - Fernandes in his own wordsBruno Fernandes sits down with Kelly Somers to discuss his family and why people are entitled to their opinions on him.2 days ago2 days ago'I'm much more calm off the pitch - but still passionate'Bruno Fernandes sits down with Kelly Somers and reveals how he deals with criticism, and talks about life outside the game.2 days agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
