She and her siblings had been left sleeping in a holiday apartment while her parents, Kate and Gerry, went for dinner at a nearby restaurant.They had checked in on the children periodically until Kate discovered Madeleine was missing at around 22:00.Brückner is currently serving a seven-year prison sentence in Germany for the rape of an elderly 72-year-old woman at her home in Praia da Luz in 2005.German authorities have said he will be released by Wednesday.Det Ch Insp Mark Cranwell said Brückner remains a suspect in the Met Police's own investigation into Madeleine's disappearance. He has been the prime suspect in the German and Portuguese investigations since 2020 and 2022, respectively."We have requested an interview with this German suspect but, for legal reasons, this can only be done via an International Letter of Request which has been submitted," Det Ch Insp Cranwell said."It was subsequently refused by the suspect. In the absence of an interview, we will nevertheless continue to pursue any viable lines of inquiry."We can provide no further information while the investigation is ongoing."HandoutMadeleine McCann disappeared in 2007, then aged threeMadeleine's disappearance has become one of the highest-profile unsolved missing person cases in the world.German prosecutors have pointed to evidence - including mobile phone data - indicating Brückner may have been in the area when she vanished, and have consistently insisted that they think he is responsible.However, they have not found strong enough evidence to bring charges. Brückner, who spent many years in the Algarve, was a drifter, a petty criminal and a convicted sex offender. He has several previous convictions, including for sexually abusing children in 1994 and 2016.Portuguese and German police conducted a fresh search between where the McCanns had been staying and addresses linked to Brückner in June this year, but this yielded no breakthroughs.PA MediaInvestigators have been searching scrubland and abandoned buildings in the latest searches for Madeleine McCannIn 2023, investigators carried out searches near the Barragem do Arade reservoir, about 30 miles from Praia da Luz.Brückner spent time in the Praia da Luz area between 2000 and 2017 and had photographs and videos of himself near the reservoir.In October last year, Brückner was cleared of unrelated sexual offences by a German court, alleged to have taken place in Portugal between 2000 and 2017.Due to differences in legal systems, German authorities suspect Brückner of murder in relation to Madeleine McCann, while British police continue to treat her disappearance as a missing persons case.The funding given to the Met's investigation, Operation Grange, has totalled more than £13.2m since 2011. A further £108,000 was secured from the government in April.More on this storyMadeleine McCann disappearance: A timelineHopes of closure fade as police wrap up Madeleine McCann search Madeleine McCann search goes on but is it 18 years too late?GermanyMadeleine McCann disappearancePortugalMetropolitan Police ServiceRelatedNI's missed chance 'a step in the right direction'Were Nagelsmann's NI comments 'disrespectful' or 'deflective'?Highlights: Germany beat NI with quick-fire doubleMore from the BBC16 hrs agoWe will never surrender our flag, Sir Keir Starmer saysThe prime minister said the flag represents "our diverse country" and he will not allow people to feel intimidated.16 hrs ago2 days agoMan charged over damage to London synagoguesThe 37-year-old man has been charged with racially or religiously aggravated criminal damage, the Met Police said.2 days ago2 days agoEight Met Police officers suspended after BBC investigationThe accusations include excessive use of force, discriminatory and misogynistic comments. 2 days ago2 days ago'I can't change people's opinions of me' - Fernandes in his own wordsBruno Fernandes sits down with Kelly Somers to discuss his family and why people are entitled to their opinions on him.2 days ago2 days ago'I'm much more calm off the pitch - but still passionate'Bruno Fernandes sits down with Kelly Somers and reveals how he deals with criticism, and talks about life outside the game.2 days agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
