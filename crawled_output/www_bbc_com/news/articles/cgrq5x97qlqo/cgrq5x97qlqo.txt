Fed board ahead of key interest rate vote16 hours agoShareSaveOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterShareSaveGetty ImagesStephen Miran will be the first sitting White House official to join the Fed's board in decadesThe US Senate has cleared President Donald Trump's pick Stephen Miran to join the Federal Reserve's board of governors - part of a panel responsible for setting the country's interest rates.Miran, who is chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, will be the first sitting White House official to join the Fed's board since its creation in its current form in the 1930s.He was narrowly confirmed on Monday with a vote of 48-47.The economist's entry has raised concerns over the central bank's longstanding independence and follows Trump's bid to reshape the Federal Reserve.Miran is expected to take part in a key Fed policy meeting this week as one of 12 voting members, playing a central role in Trump's bid for a large interest rate cut.The Fed is expected to approve a quarter-percentage point rate cut to support a weakening labour market.Miran is a supporter of Trump's global tariffs, arguing the import duties won't fuel inflation and that policies like stricter immigration will reduce housing demand and lower prices.The White House economist's fast-tracked confirmation vote has proceeded in just a few weeks, when it typically takes months for a Fed governor nominee to be confirmed by the Senate.Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat, raised concerns that Miran would be seen as a "puppet" who would not be trusted as an independent voice on the Fed board.Trump has put pressure on the Fed for months, demanding interest rate cuts to give the US economy a boost and make it cheaper for the government to borrow.The president has taken aim at Fed chair Jerome Powell, calling him a "numbskull" and "too late".The Miran vote also comes as Trump is also attempting to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook from the central bank, citing allegations of mortgage fraud and constitutional powers to remove her.Cook, the first black woman to serve as a Fed governor, has denied the allegations and sued to block her removal.She has voted in recent months to keep interest rates on hold this year.On Monday, a US appeals court denied the justice department's request to lift an earlier ruling to temporarily block Trump from removing Cook.The Trump administration is also pursuing mortgage fraud investigations against Senator Adam Schiff and New York Attorney General Letitia James, both political antagonists of the president.US economyInternational BusinessUS Federal ReserveDonald TrumpRelatedPoorer Americans hit hardest as tariffs fuel price risesUS watchdog launches review into economic data collectionUS created 911,000 fewer jobs than thought in year to MarchMore from the BBC19 mins agoWatch: 'I'm not afraid of you!' - Cory Booker clashes with Kash PatelThe senator from New Jersey crticised Patel during a hearing over what he claims have been repeated missteps as FBI director.19 mins ago1 hr agoLittle-Pengelly says Trump boycott 'a mistake' Only one of NI's leaders will attend a state banquet for the US president in London. 1 hr ago1 hr ago'Completely different, yet genuinely get on' - BBC correspondents on Starmer and TrumpThe BBC's Political Editor Chris Mason and North America Editor Sarah Smith discuss what's at stake for both sides during the trip.1 hr ago2 hrs agoUS designates Colombia as country 'failing to cooperate in drug war'For the first time in almost three decades Colombia loses its certification as a US ally in the war on drugs. 2 hrs ago2 hrs agoDonald Trump's second UK state visit: Here's what we knowUS President Donald Trump and his wife Melania are coming to the UK for an unprecedented second state visit.2 hrs agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
