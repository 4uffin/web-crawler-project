Yet the economic impact of ending tariff preferences would be limited. Trade commissioner Maroš Šefčovič estimated the effect at just €227m a year.The only measure that takes immediate effect is the suspension of bilateral support to the Israeli government. But this too is largely symbolic with a mere €9.4m out of €14m allocated for 2020–24 – and does not require approval from member states.Mediterranean Commissioner Dubravka Šuica stressed that funding for programmes tackling antisemitism and supporting civil society would not be affected.Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar dismissed the Commission's proposals as "morally and politically distorted", warning on X that actions against Israel would damage Europe's own interests and vowing that any steps taken against his country would be answered "in kind."It's not immediately clear when the measures will be voted on by members.Spanish PM calls for Israel to be barred from international sportIsrael has committed genocide in Gaza, UN commission of inquiry saysDoes Israel face a 'South Africa moment' over Gaza?'The bombing has been insane': Palestinians scramble to flee Israeli assault on Gaza CityIsrael & the PalestiniansIsrael-Gaza warIsraelEconomic sanctionsEuropean CommissionRelatedIsraeli tanks push into major Gaza City residential areaIsrael and the Palestinians: History of the conflict explainedBowen: UN commission report on genocide is blunt indictment of Israel's actions in GazaMore from the BBC3 hrs agoIsrael threatens national film awards after Palestinian story wins top prizeThe Sea follows a boy from the occupied West Bank who wants to visit Tel Aviv to see the sea for the first time.3 hrs ago13 hrs agoThousands of Palestinians flee as Israeli troops push into Gaza CityIsrael says its aim is to defeat up to 3,000 Hamas fighters who remain there, but the offensive has drawn international condemnation.13 hrs ago18 hrs agoTen sick Gazan children arrive in UK for treatmentThe group are the first to be brought to the UK for treatment under a government scheme.18 hrs ago19 hrs agoBen & Jerry's co-founder quits over social activism rowHis resignation marks the latest development in a dispute with parent company Unilever.19 hrs ago1 day agoTwo Labour MPs denied entry to IsraelSimon Opher and Peter Prinsley say they were heading to the occupied West Bank when they were stopped by Israeli authorities. 1 day agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
