Israel launched its war in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.At least 65,000 people have been killed in Israeli attacks since then, almost half of them women and children, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.On Tuesday, a UN commission of inquiry said Israel had committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. Israel's foreign ministry rejected the report and denounced it as "distorted and false".Daniel Meron, Israel's ambassador to the UN, says Israel "categorically rejects the libellous rant"West Bank documentary maker criticises US policy in Oscars speechPalestinian Oscar winner released after attack by Israeli settlers, co-director saysIsrael-Gaza warIsraelThe OscarsFilmRelatedIsraeli tanks push into major Gaza City residential areaThousands of Palestinians flee as Israeli troops push into Gaza CityEU proposes curbs on trade with Israel over Gaza warMore from the BBC5 hrs agoThe Summer I Turned Pretty to conclude with feature filmThe hit young-adult series will conclude with what author and showrunner Han says is "another big milestone" in Belly's journey. 5 hrs ago12 hrs agoFilm studio expansion plans approvedThe £33.5m scheme will see derelict buildings near Northern Studios become production facilities.12 hrs ago12 hrs agoBBC's delayed Ozzy Osbourne film gets new dateThe documentary about the rock legend was pulled from the schedules at the last minute a month ago.12 hrs ago1 day agoTwo Labour MPs denied entry to IsraelSimon Opher and Peter Prinsley say they were heading to the occupied West Bank when they were stopped by Israeli authorities. 1 day ago1 day agoActing legend Robert Redford dies aged 89The acting star was famous for roles in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.1 day agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
