Australia - one of the world's biggest polluters per capita - has already reached warming of above 1.5C, the report said, noting that at 3C, heat-related deaths in Sydney may rise by more than 400% and almost triple in Melbourne.The 72-page report - released days before the government announces its emissions reduction targets for 2035 - found that no Australian community will be immune from climate risks that will be "cascading, compounding and concurrent".It warned of more heatwave-related deaths, poorer water quality due to severe flooding and bushfires, and property values to drop by A$611bn ($406bn; £300bn).By 2050, the report found the number of coastal communities located in "high and very high risk areas" in Australia will increase and if populations levels remain at current levels, this will mean more than 1.5 million people will be at risk.Areas in northern Australia, along with remote communities and outer suburbs of major cities, were particularly at risk, the report said."This will put pressure on health, critical infrastructure, natural species and ecosystems, and primary industries," the report warned, as well as posing extra challenges for emergency responders.The report also found that coral reefs such as the Great Barrier Reef in Queensland and Ningaloo Reef in Western Australia - both already hit by record bleaching events - will face higher risks of "bleaching and biodiversity loss" due to warmer oceans.Great Barrier Reef suffers worst coral decline on recordWorst bleaching on record for Western Australian coral reefsWatch: Tropical storm erodes iconic Australian beach"One thing that is very clear from this climate assessment is that our whole country has a lot at stake," Bowen said. "The cost of inaction will always outweigh the cost of action."In response to the report, the government released a national adaptation plan which detailed how federal, state and local governments can work together to tackle climate issues, according to Bowen."We will also set an ambitious and achievable 2035 target, informed by advice from the independent Climate Change Authority," he said, referring to the body that provides advice on climate policy.Australia has pledged to reduce emissions by 43% by 2030, but is criticised for its continued heavy reliance on fossil fuels. Climate Council chief executive Amanda McKenzie said the report's findings were terrifying and called on the government to commit to higher emissions cuts."Australia cannot afford a timid 2035 target when our own government data shows the catastrophic costs of inaction," the head of the the non-profit said."The longer we delay the deep and sustained cuts to climate pollution we need, the harder it becomes to protect communities from escalating heatwaves, floods and bushfire weather."Effects of global warmingClimateAustraliaRelatedMajor Australian gas project extended until 2070Council scraps 2030 net-zero targetWetter weather 'perfect' for growing Scottish truffles, scientists sayMore from the BBC12 hrs agoReform climate motion sparks opposition angerThe Reform motion is calling for the council's climate emergency declaration to be rescinded.12 hrs ago20 hrs agoG'Day Ed Sheeran: Ipswich Down Under wants gig tooTeresa Harding visits the Thomas Wolsey, which staged a surprise Ed Sheeran gig earlier this year.20 hrs ago2 days agoClimate activists arrested after Abbey protestThe Abbey's scheduled tours were cancelled and nearby roads were closed by emergency services2 days ago2 days agoRare ladybird recorded in the UK for the first timeThe Little Arboreal Ladybirds have made their way to the UK across the English Channel.2 days ago4 days agoCouncil brings forward carbon neutral plansStafford Borough Council now plans to achieve net zero emissions by 2035, instead of 2040.4 days agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
