The father then spoke to a youth pastor, who called the US Marshals. Afterwards, his father persuaded Robinson to surrender to police, a development investigators described as pivotal in the case.The suspect is now being held without bail at Utah County Jail, where he is on special watch to determine if he is a risk to himself or others, police told the BBC's US partner CBS News.An affidavit from the state of Utah confirms that Robinson was arrested on suspicion of the crimes of aggravated murder, felony discharge of a firearm, and obstruction of justice.On Monday, FBI director Kash Patel stated that DNA found on a towel wrapped around the suspected murder weapon matched the suspect.Patel also referenced a note that he said was discovered at Robinson's home, which allegedly included a threat to "take out" Kirk. It's "basically saying... 'I have the opportunity to take out Charlie Kirk', and I'm going to take it.' That note was written before the shooting," Patel said.Patel added that although the note was destroyed, forensic investigators recovered evidence confirming its existence.Utah County Attorney Jeff Gray said he anticipates filing formal charges on Tuesday. Robinson also is expected to make his first court appearance on Tuesday.Robinson has no prior convictions and no history of violent offences, according to a Public Safety Assessment Report filed in Utah state court.FBIAt a press briefing on Friday announcing the arrest, FBI officials declined to discuss Robinson's background, political leanings or a possible motive, saying the investigation was ongoing. "We are confident we have the right individual in custody," an FBI spokesperson said, "but we are still working to establish the full picture of who he is and why he acted."Shooting throws Utah students into heart of US political divideSuspected killer brought into custody after confessing to fatherUtah Governor Spencer Cox said a family member told investigators that Robinson had become "more political" in recent years. The relative also said that during a dinner conversation before the attack, Robinson had discussed Kirk's upcoming event at Utah Valley University where he was gunned down on 10 September, according to Cox."They talked about why they didn't like him and the viewpoints that he had," Cox said.Public records reviewed by the BBC suggest Robinson had in the past registered as an unaffiliated, or nonpartisan, voter in Utah. His parents, Matthew Carl Robinson and Amber Denise Robinson are registered Republicans, according to state records.People who lived in the Robinsons' Washington, Utah, neighbourhood told the BBC he had a good reputation in the community. One neighbour, who asked the BBC not to publish her name, called his parents "amazing" and hard workers.Tyler Robinson, who had an apartment in St. George near his family home, was not enrolled at UVU, the site of the shooting. In a statement, the Utah Board of Higher Education said Tyler James Robinson was a third-year student in the electrical apprenticeship programme at Dixie Technical College. "He previously spent one semester at Utah State University in 2021 and earned concurrent enrolment credits through Utah Tech University while in high school between 2019 and 2021," it added.Social media accounts indicate Robinson's father runs a kitchen countertop and cabinet installation business, while his mother is a social worker. The family is Mormon and active in the local church. Utah governor details how Charlie Kirk murder suspect apprehendedInvestigators also are looking at social media accounts used by Robinson,
and any signs that anyone may have known about or encouraged the shooting beforehand.Authorities said Robinson appeared to have been active on Discord, the social media platform primarily used by gamers, but now also popular in other communities.According to an affidavit, a roommate of Robinson's showed investigators messages on Discord from a contact named "Tyler" referencing a rifle "drop point" and instructions about retrieving and hiding the weapon.The suspect also appears to have confessed to friends on Discord shortly before turning himself in to law enforcement, according to US media reports on Monday."Hey guys, I have bad news for you all," said a message from an account belonging to Robinson, according to the Washington Post. "It was me at UVU yesterday. im (sic) sorry for all of this."But officials said he is "not co-operating" with authorities and has not confessed to carrying out the shooting.The reported message on Discord was sent on Thursday night, about two hours before officials said Robinson was taken into custody.Discord later issued a statement saying his account had been suspended.
"We have removed the suspect's account for violating our off-platform behavior policy," it said.Authorities have also pointed to inscriptions on shell casings linked to the case.Two casings displayed apparent references to online trolling humour. The inscription "notices bulges OwO what's this?" on a fired shell casing may refer to a "copypasta" - a piece of text that is repeated over and over again, often to troll people online. Another casing, that was unfired, was inscribed with the words "If you read this, you are gay lmao" - again an apparent reference to a trolling joke.Meanwhile, other casings could be interpreted as sympathetic to Antifa, or the anti-fascist movement, a loose collection of far-left activists who have been active in the US over the last decade and often demonstrate against Trump policies and far-right groups.
One unfired casing had the words "Hey fascist! Catch!" and an up, right and three down arrows. The three down arrows alone could be a common symbol used for anti-fascism. But as a whole, the arrows could reference a sequence of control inputs used in a popular video game - although this remains unclear, and authorities have not yet released images of the casings.A second casing was inscribed with lyrics to the song "Bella Ciao" that honours World War Two-era partisans of the Italian resistance who fought Nazi Germany.The investigation into his background and motives continues in what officials are calling one of the most significant political killings in recent US history.US gun violenceUnited StatesUtahRelatedCharlie Kirk memorial service set to take place in Arizona stadium'We knew the family': Utah town in disbelief after local resident accused of killing Charlie Kirk'I will never let your legacy die' - Charlie Kirk's widow gives tearful address after shootingMore from the BBC4 hrs agoUS destroys alleged Venezuelan drug boat, killing threeThe attack came after the Venezuelan president said Caracas would defend itself against US "aggression".4 hrs ago4 hrs agoDC-style crackdown on crime coming to Memphis, Tennessee, Trump saysTrump signs a proclamation establishing a task force to take on crime in the Democrat-let city despite opposition from its mayor.4 hrs ago4 hrs agoReport those who celebrate Charlie Kirk death to employers, Vance saysThe vice-president's remarks come amid a wave of firings over posts deemed inappropriate about Kirk's death.4 hrs ago7 hrs agoCharlie Kirk suspect linked to crime scene by DNA, says FBI chiefKash Patel says Tyler Robinson's DNA was found on towel wrapping suspected murder weapon.
