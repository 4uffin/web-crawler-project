Key among the plans is a proposal from US nuclear group X-Energy and UK energy company Centrica to build up to 12 advanced modular nuclear reactors in Hartlepool, with the potential to power 1.5 million homes and create up to 2,500 jobs. The broader programme could be worth up to £40bn, with £12bn focused in the north east of England.Other plans include multinational firms such as Last Energy and DP World working together on a micro modular reactor at London Gateway port. This is backed by £80m in private investment.Elsewhere, Holtec, EDF and Tritax are also planning to repurpose the former Cottam coal-fired plant in Nottinghamshire into a nuclear-powered data centre hub. This project is estimated to be worth £11bn and could create thousands of high-skilled construction jobs, as well as permanent jobs in long-term operations.Beyond power generation, the new partnership includes collaboration on fusion energy research, and an end to UK and US reliance on Russian nuclear material by 2028.Commenting on the agreement, Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said: "Nuclear will power our homes with clean, homegrown energy and the private sector is building it in Britain, delivering growth and well-paid, skilled jobs for working people."And US Energy Secretary Chris Wright described the move as a "nuclear renaissance", saying it would enhance energy security and meet growing global power demands, particularly from AI and data infrastructure.Sir Keir has previously said he wants the UK to return to being "one of the world leaders on nuclear".In the 1990s, nuclear power generated about 25% of the UK's electricity but that figure has fallen to around 15%, with no new power stations built since then and many of the country's ageing reactors due to be decommissioned over the next decade.In November 2024, the UK and 30 other countries signed a global pledge to triple their nuclear capacity by 2050.And earlier this year, the government announced a deal with private investors to build the Sizewell C nuclear power station in Suffolk.Its nuclear programme also includes the UK's first small modular reactors (SMRs), which will be built by UK firm Rolls Royce.More on this story How does nuclear power work and why is the UK investing in it?Nuclear power stations extended by 12 monthsSizewell C pledged to lower bills but will take at least 10 yearsNuclear powerRelated'Sizewell C oak tree felling would be devastating' Nuclear industry says waste site is keyJellyfish disrupt French nuclear power plant for second time in a monthBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
