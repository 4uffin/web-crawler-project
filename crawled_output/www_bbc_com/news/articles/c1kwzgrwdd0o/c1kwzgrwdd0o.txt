"That's right out of Goodfellas," the Texas Republican said, affecting a mobster's accent.Other Republicans in Congress have been more muted in their criticism of how the FCC pressed Disney-owned ABC to take action on Kimmel, who was indefinitely suspended on Wednesday.The row started after Kimmel appeared to suggest in his monologue on Monday night that the alleged gunman charged with murdering Kirk was a Maga Republican, although authorities in Utah have said the suspect was "indoctrinated with leftist ideology".Before ABC's decision, Carr said there would be consequences if Kimmel stayed on air. The FCC chairman said that Kimmel was "appearing to directly mislead the American public" in his on-air remarks.Watch: Ros Atkins on… What Jimmy Kimmel being taken off air means for free speech in the USThe FCC is in charge of granting broadcast licenses to networks such as ABC, NBC and CBS, and they are required under statute to be in the public interest.On his podcast Verdict with Ted Cruz, the senator emphasised on Friday that he hated what Kimmel said about Kirk, and he is "thrilled that he was fired". He also said Carr was "a good guy"."But what he said there is dangerous as hell," Cruz added. "And so he threatens, explicitly, we're going to cancel ABC's licence. "We're going to take them off the air so ABC cannot broadcast anymore. He says we can do this the easy way, or we could do this the hard way, yeah. And I got to say that's right out of Goodfellas. "That's right out of a mafioso coming into a bar going, nice bar you have here, it'd be a shame if something happened to it," he added, using a mobster voice.He warned that if the government gets into the business of bans and regulating what the media says "that will end up bad for conservatives".In the Oval Office on Friday, President Donald Trump defended Carr and said "I disagree with Ted Cruz", who is ordinarily one of his staunchest allies. The president also lashed out at ABC News reporter Jonathan Karl when he asked the president about free speech.Another Republican Senator, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, told reporters that Cruz was "absolutely right" in his criticism of Carr.Tillis, who will not seek re-election next year, said the FCC chairman's comments were "just unacceptable behaviour".Republicans in Congress have generally been toeing the party line with their response to Kimmel's suspension as the nation is shaken by the political and cultural aftershocks of Kirk's killing.But Senator Jerry Moran, a Republican from Kansas, sounded a note of caution on Thursday."The conservative position is free speech is free speech, and we better be very careful about any lines we cross in diminishing free speech," Moran told Politico.South Dakota Senator Mike Rounds said he would approach it as an "employer-employee issue".Kimmel has not publicly commented about his suspension, but his late-night colleagues - including Jon Stewart, Jimmy Fallon and outgoing host Stephen Colbert - responded on Thursday with a show of solidarity. Kirk was fatally shot on 10 September during an open-air event on a Utah college campus.On Thursday, the Senate passed a resolution to designate 14 October - Kirk's birthday - a day of remembrance for him. Lawmakers in the US House of Representatives approved the resolution - nearly 100 Democrats opposed it.Charlie Kirk: Conservative influencer who rallied a youth movementUS TV hosts back Kimmel as Trump threatens networksThe motive behind Charlie Kirk's killing: What we know and don't knowRepublican PartyTelevisionDonald TrumpUS politicsUnited StatesRelatedReport those who celebrate Charlie Kirk death to employers, Vance says'I will never let your legacy die' - Charlie Kirk's widow gives tearful address after shootingMichigan judge dismisses charges against 'fake' 2020 electorsMore from the BBC32 mins agoUS prosecutor resigns after Trump says 'I want him out'Erik Siebert was investigating accusations of mortgage fraud against Trump adversary Letitia James.32 mins ago52 mins agoWhat does the FCC do - and can it revoke a TV network's licence?The suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's show has triggered concerns about the US communications regulator's power over TV networks. 52 mins ago1 hr agoSikh granny's arrest by US immigration sparks community angerHarjit Kaur, a 73-year-old who unsuccessfully applied for asylum, was arrested by immigration authorities last week.1 hr ago1 hr agoTrump says Xi approves of TikTok deal as leaders plan South Korea meetingThe president hailed "progress" during a phone call with Xi and said that he also would travel to China next year.1 hr ago2 hrs ago'Jesus, Take the Wheel' songwriter Brett James dies in US plane crashFriends and co-artists remember the Grammy-winning writer as "a songwriting force of nature".2 hrs agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
