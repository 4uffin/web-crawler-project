"The time for being soft on these Illegal Immigrant Criminals is OVER under my watch," Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform. Chandra Mouli Nagamallaiah, 50, was attacked with a machete by his co-worker Yordanis Cobos-Martinez in front of his wife and child, following a heated argument over a broken washing machine. The accused, who is now in custody, has been charged with murder.Trump has long vowed tougher enforcement against undocumented migrants, making it a central plank of his policy.Trump said Mr Cobos-Martinez "will be prosecuted to the fullest extent" of the law and will be "charged with murder in the first degree".He also criticised the Biden administration in his post saying Mr Cobos-Martinez was previously arrested for several crimes, including alleged child abuse, but was "released back into society because Cuba declined to accept his return".According to the Department of Homeland Security, Mr Cobos-Martinez is an undocumented immigrant, with a final order of removal from the US.The department claims he was in custody at a detention center in Dallas but was released on an order of supervision in January after Cuba "would not accept him because of his criminal history". Nagamallaiah, who belonged to the southern Indian state of Karnataka, worked at the Downtown Suites Motel in Dallas.He went to school and college in the southern Indian city of Bengaluru before moving to the US in 2018. His son graduated high school recently and is preparing to begin college, according to a news report on NDTV news channel.The assault took place on 10 September. The police said they received a "stabbing" call and a preliminary investigation determined that Mr Cobos-Martinez had cut the victim with an edged weapon several times. US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has lodged Mr Cobos-Martinez with the Dallas County Jail, where he is being held. Nagamallaiah's funeral was held on 13 September in Flower Mound, Texas, and was attended by family and friends. A fundraiser launched to support his family has raised more than $321,000 (£2,36,723), according to news agency PTI.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.AsiaImmigrationIndiaDonald TrumpUnited StatesRelatedHomes damaged, cars swept away as rains flood India's UttarakhandChinese teens to pay $300,000 for urinating in soupWhy more women get cancer in India - but more men die More from the BBC7 mins agoAmerica's unofficial party house where presidents like Trump stay in LondonThe ambassador's residence in central London has a colourful history and may be on Trump's itinerary.7 mins ago38 mins agoDonald Trump's second UK state visit: Here's what we knowUS President Donald Trump and his wife Melania are coming to the UK for an unprecedented second state visit.38 mins ago55 mins agoCharlie Kirk suspect said he 'had enough of his hatred', prosecutors allegeThe 22-year-old, who is charged with murder, also allegedly hid a confession under a keyboard for his roommate to discover.55 mins ago59 mins agoWho is Tyler Robinson, the suspect in custody for shooting Charlie Kirk?The 22-year-old man from Utah is set to appear in court on Tuesday to face formal charges over the killing.59 mins ago1 hr agoKash Patel's combative Senate hearing: key takeaways Patel shrugged off any criticism of his handling of the bureau and clashed with Democratic lawmakers.1 hr agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
