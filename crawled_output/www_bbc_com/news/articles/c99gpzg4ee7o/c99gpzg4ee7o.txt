"The time for being soft on these Illegal Immigrant Criminals is OVER under my watch," Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform. Chandra Mouli Nagamallaiah, 50, was attacked with a machete by his co-worker Yordanis Cobos-Martinez in front of his wife and child, following a heated argument over a broken washing machine. The accused, who is now in custody, has been charged with murder.Trump has long vowed tougher enforcement against undocumented migrants, making it a central plank of his policy.Trump said Mr Cobos-Martinez "will be prosecuted to the fullest extent" of the law and will be "charged with murder in the first degree".He also criticised the Biden administration in his post saying Mr Cobos-Martinez was previously arrested for several crimes, including alleged child abuse, but was "released back into society because Cuba declined to accept his return".According to the Department of Homeland Security, Mr Cobos-Martinez is an undocumented immigrant, with a final order of removal from the US.The department claims he was in custody at a detention center in Dallas but was released on an order of supervision in January after Cuba "would not accept him because of his criminal history". Nagamallaiah, who belonged to the southern Indian state of Karnataka, worked at the Downtown Suites Motel in Dallas.He went to school and college in the southern Indian city of Bengaluru before moving to the US in 2018. His son graduated high school recently and is preparing to begin college, according to a news report on NDTV news channel.The assault took place on 10 September. The police said they received a "stabbing" call and a preliminary investigation determined that Mr Cobos-Martinez had cut the victim with an edged weapon several times. US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has lodged Mr Cobos-Martinez with the Dallas County Jail, where he is being held. Nagamallaiah's funeral was held on 13 September in Flower Mound, Texas, and was attended by family and friends. A fundraiser launched to support his family has raised more than $321,000 (£2,36,723), according to news agency PTI.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.AsiaImmigrationIndiaDonald TrumpUnited StatesRelatedHow a man's affair with his mother-in-law became a viral film in IndonesiaThe lonely life and death of Delhi's only African elephantUS revokes visas of Indian executives over alleged fentanyl traffickingMore from the BBC40 mins ago'Jesus, Take the Wheel' songwriter Brett James dies in US plane crashFriends and co-artists remember the Grammy-winning writer as "a songwriting force of nature".40 mins ago46 mins agoWho is in Nato and what are Article 4 and Article 5?In June, member states agreed to boost defence spending and reconfirmed Nato's mutual security guarantee.46 mins ago57 mins agoUS vaccine panel no longer recommends Covid-19 jab to adultsThe panel has also changed its recommendation on the MMRV vaccine and delayed a vote on the hepatitis B jab.57 mins ago2 hrs agoMinister rejects Trump's call for military to tackle illegal migrationUS President Donald Trump suggested the military could help tackle illegal migration to the UK. 2 hrs ago4 hrs agoTrump adds $100,000 fee for skilled worker visa applicants"Train Americans," said the commerce secretary.
