A source close to the mayor said Trump's politics sowed "fear and division".This latest war of words adds to the pair's feud, with Trump in 2019 calling the mayor "a stone-cold loser" and Sir Sadiq accusing him of stirring up far-right politics.Trump echoed his past attacks on the mayor's governing of London, calling him a "disaster" on immigration."I think the Mayor of London Khan is among the worst mayors in the world, and we have some bad ones," he said."I think he's done a terrible job. Crime in London is through the roof.""I asked that he not be there. He wanted to be there, as I understand, I didn't want him."In response, a source close to Sir Sadiq rejected Trump's assessment of the mayor's work."Trump's politics is one of fear and division. This includes talking down our great capital city," they said."London is a global success story - it's open, dynamic and safer than major US cities. Perhaps that's one of the reasons record numbers of Americans are choosing to make London their home."The pair's long-running row dates back to 2015 when the Labour politician condemned Trump's suggestion that Muslims should be banned from travelling to the US. A year later, Trump challenged the mayor to an IQ test.The US leader also attacked the mayor's handling of the London Bridge terror attack in 2017.During the US leader's first state visit in 2019, Sir Sadiq permitted a plan to fly a giant inflatable "Trump baby" blimp to coincide with his trip.In July, Trump took another swipe at the mayor during a press conference with Sir Keir Starmer in Scotland, calling Sir Sadiq a "nasty person", to which the prime minister interjected saying: "He's a friend of mine, actually."The US president's second state visit to the UK - unprecedented for a non-royal - was largely marked by pomp and ceremony to signal the warm relations between the two allies.However, thousands of protesters gathered in Parliament Square for a rally against the visit.Four men were arrested after images of Trump and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein were projected on to Windsor Castle ahead of the state banquet.Sarah Smith: Trump visit showed UK's warm relations - and limited influenceTrump suggests Starmer could use military to control UK bordersKey takeaways from Trump-Starmer news conferenceMayor of LondonDonald TrumpUK-US relationsSadiq KhanRelatedGenocide happening in Gaza, Sir Sadiq Khan saysClosing police counters is pragmatic, says mayorMayor denies late warning on Oxford Street trialMore from the BBC31 mins agoUS prosecutor resigns after Trump says 'I want him out'Erik Siebert was investigating accusations of mortgage fraud against Trump adversary Letitia James.31 mins ago1 hr agoTrump says Xi approves of TikTok deal as leaders plan South Korea meetingThe president hailed "progress" during a phone call with Xi and said that he also would travel to China next year.1 hr ago1 hr agoSenator Ted Cruz says US broadcast regulator acted like 'mafioso' on Jimmy Kimmel The Texas senator affected a mobster accent to criticise how ABC was pressed to take action on the late-night host.1 hr ago2 hrs agoWho is in Nato and what are Article 4 and Article 5?In June, member states agreed to boost defence spending and reconfirmed Nato's mutual security guarantee.2 hrs ago3 hrs agoMinister rejects Trump's call for military to tackle illegal migrationUS President Donald Trump suggested the military could help tackle illegal migration to the UK. 3 hrs agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
