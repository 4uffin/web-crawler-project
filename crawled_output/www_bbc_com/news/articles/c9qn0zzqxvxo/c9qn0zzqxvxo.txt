"In my opinion, you are hurting Australia very much right now, and they want to get along with me."Trump said he was going to be meeting Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese "very soon", adding: "I'm going to tell him about you. You set a very bad tone."When Lyons tried to ask another question, Trump held his index finger to his lips before saying "quiet" and moved away to speak to another journalist. For months, Albanese has been seeking a meeting with the US president after talks between the pair were cancelled at the last-minute when Trump left the G20 summit in June earlier than expected to deal with the war in the Middle East.Albanese - who will be in the US for the UN General Assembly next week - told ABC radio on Monday that he and Trump would "see each other in New York"."He's hosting a reception on Tuesday night of next week. And as well, we'll see each other at various forums that are taking place between now and the end of the year."Getty ImagesTrump said the journalist was "hurting Australia very much"In recent months, US-Australia relations have become strained since the Trump administration announced a review into Aukus, a major submarine deal worth £176bn ($239bn; A$368bn) between the US, UK and Australia which was signed in 2021. In April, Australia was also hit with a tariff of at least 10% on all exports to the US, which Albanese said was "not the act of a friend".Lyons said after the terse response from Trump that it was an "absurd notion" that asking legitimate questions politely would hurt relations between the long-time allies. "For me, it was a perfectly normal thing to do to ask questions that I don't think were provocative," he told the ABC, adding his enquiries were fair, based on research and not asked in an abusive way.The ABC said his questions were part of an investigation by their Four Corners programme looking into Trump's business dealings since returning to office.Shortly after the tense exchange, a social media post on an official White House account showing the response was captioned: Trump "smacks down a rude foreign Fake News loser".Australia to lift import ban on US beef after Trump tariffs tiffTrade trumps geopolitics as Australia PM visits ChinaDonald TrumpUnited StatesAustraliaRelatedWhy America is at a dangerous crossroads following the Charlie Kirk shooting Jimmy Kimmel taken off air over Charlie Kirk commentsWhat was on the menu and who was on guest list at state banquet?More from the BBCJust nowSex abuse charges against top Australian radio host downgradedHe faces 27 charges which allege that he indecently assaulted or groped nine men from 2001 to 2019.Just now45 mins agoBody found in car registered to D4vd identified as missing teenAuthorities say the cause and time of the 15-year-old girl's death are still unknown.45 mins ago46 mins agoAustralia announces higher emission cuts by 2035The country is one of the world's biggest carbon emitters per capita.46 mins ago1 hr ago'Ultimate in cancel culture': Fans outside Jimmy Kimmel studio react to show's axingThe BBC spoke to fans who expressed surprise and disappointment after the late night show was taken off air "indefinitely" over Charlie Kirk comments.1 hr ago5 hrs ago'Pay attention' - Spirit aircraft warned as it gets too close to Air Force OneAir traffic controllers warn Spirit flight after it came too close to President Donald Trump's aircraft as he flew to the United Kingdom for his state visit. 5 hrs agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
