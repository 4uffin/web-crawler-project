Malawians have been eagerly awaiting results, but the commission has not yet released any - despite the fact that nearly all votes have been counted. The commission is expected to announce the outcome only after all votes have been tallied and verified in order to avoid the possibility of the final result being challenged. A candidate needs to win more than 50% of the vote, or a run-off is held.
The 2019 election was marred by controversy when the highest court annulled then-President Mutharika's victory, citing widespread irregularities. Chakwera, 70, won the re-run by a wide margin, propelling him to the presidency. Mutharika, 85, is hoping to regain office in what would be a dramatic political comeback.Malawians also voted in parliamentary and local elections following a campaign dominated by the worsening economic crisis that has seen a severe shortage of fuel and foreign currency. The official inflation rate is close to 30%, with a frozen chicken in a supermarket in the capital, Lilongwe, costing about $20 (£15), in a nation where most people live on $2 a day or less.More about Malawi from the BBC:What is at stake in Malawi's elections as cost-of-living bites?'I tell my children not to play so we save money on soap'How brave judges rejected a 'second-rate election'Getty Images/BBCGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.Follow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafricaBBC Africa podcastsFocus on AfricaThis Is AfricaMalawiAfricaRelatedMalawians await presidential poll result in vote dominated by economic woesWhat is at stake in Malawi's elections as cost-of-living bites?Malawi - where the petrol queue might overshadow the queue to voteMore from the BBC7 hrs agoUS deportees sue Ghana over 'illegal' detentionDespite opposition to the deal, Ghana's president says 40 more deportees will arrive from the US.7 hrs ago14 hrs agoTogo leader's sister-in-law arrested after calling for end to family ruleMarguerite Gnakadé has become a vocal critic of Togo's long-serving leader Faure Gnassingbé.14 hrs ago20 hrs agoNew project to fight 'devastating' disease beginsThe University of Surrey says it is tackling schistosomiasis, a major public health issue. 20 hrs ago2 days agoTrucks set ablaze as militants block key Senegal-Mali trade routeIslamists fighters are trying to prevent deliveries of fuel and other essential supplies to landlocked Mali.2 days ago2 days agoGunmen kill 22 after shooting at baptism ceremony in Niger - reportsNiger's army has failed to contain the jihadist insurgency, with dozens killed in recent attacks.2 days agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
