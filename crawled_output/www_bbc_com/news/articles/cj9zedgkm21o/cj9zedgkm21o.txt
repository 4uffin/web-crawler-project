Nvidia said it complied with the law "in all respects" and will continue to cooperate with "all relevant government agencies".The news came as US and Chinese officials held a second day of trade talks in Spain on Monday in the latest attempt to end a trade war between the world's two biggest economies.Following the talks, US President Donald Trump hinted that a deal had been reached with China to avert a US ban on TikTok.The social media app was facing a ban in America unless it found a US buyer.The US-China trade talks in Spain were led by US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng. Following the talks, Mr Bessent said: "We had very good discussions. We preferred to keep the discussions on TikTok, we will be holding trade negotiations in about a month again at a different location."Top level trade delegations from Beijing and Washington last met in July, when they struck a deal to extend their tariffs truce by another 90 days until 10 November.The tariffs truce between China and the US cut import taxes that had reached more than 100% on each other's goods. China launched an investigation into Nvidia in December last year which was seen as the latest retaliation in a battle between the US and China over the semiconductor chip market.The US had been tightening restrictions on sales of certain exports to Chinese companies, including high-end semiconductors.The talks in Madrid were expected to address the issue of what chips, including those made by Nvidia, would be allowed to enter China.Nvidia said in a statement: "We will continue to cooperate with all relevant government agencies as they evaluate the impact of export controls on competition in the commercial markets."ReutersChina-US trade talks, headed by China's He Lifeng and Scott Bessent of the US, started on SundayAfter initially calling for TikTok to be banned during his first term, Trump has reversed his stance on the popular video-sharing app and delayed the ban three times so far.Posting on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump said a deal was "reached on a 'certain' company that young people in our country very much wanted to save. They will be very happy! I will be speaking to President Xi on Friday. The relationship remains a very strong one!!!"There had been expectations that the deadline, which was due to expire on Wednesday, might be extended for a fourth time. Although Trump was highly critical of TikTok during his first term in the White House, he softened his position after he gained popularity on the app during the 2024 presidential election.In August, The White House launched its official TikTok account.The app is one of the world's most widely-used social media platforms, with around 170 million users in the US.Why has Trump postponed the TikTok ban?What tariffs has Trump announced and why?TikTokInternational BusinessTrump tariffsChinaNvidiaDonald TrumpTradeRelatedUS says 'framework' for TikTok ownership deal agreed with ChinaHow line dancing became cool again - from village hall to TikTok crazeCan boomers decipher zoomer slang?More from the BBC31 mins agoFederal court blocks Trump from sacking Lisa CookTrump is trying to oust Cook from her role as part of a standoff between the president and the US central bank.31 mins ago33 mins agoTrump says he will sue New York Times for $15bnHe has accused the paper of defamation and libel, saying it served as a "mouthpiece" for Democrats. 33 mins ago2 hrs agoGoogle owner reveals £5bn AI investment in UK ahead of Trump visitGoogle's president and chief investment officer Ruth Porat tells the BBC there are "profound opportunities in the UK".2 hrs ago2 hrs agoDonald Trump's UK state visit is this week - here's what we knowUS President Donald Trump and his wife Melania are coming to the UK for an unprecedented second state visit.2 hrs ago4 hrs agoIndia and US seek breakthrough in day-long trade talksThe meeting comes after weeks of tension between the allies with Trump imposing high tariffs on Indian goods.4 hrs agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
