Following the talks, Mr Bessent said: "We had very good discussions. We preferred to keep the discussions on TikTok, we will be holding trade negotiations in about a month again at a different location."Top level trade delegations from Beijing and Washington last met in July, when they struck a deal to extend their tariffs truce by another 90 days until 10 November.The tariffs truce between China and the US cut import taxes that had reached more than 100% on each other's goods. China launched an investigation into Nvidia in December last year which was seen as the latest retaliation in a battle between the US and China over the semiconductor chip market.The US had been tightening restrictions on sales of certain exports to Chinese companies, including high-end semiconductors.The talks in Madrid were expected to address the issue of what chips, including those made by Nvidia, would be allowed to enter China.The BBC has contacted Nvidia for comment.ReutersChina-US trade talks, headed by China's He Lifeng and Scott Bessent of the US, started on SundayAfter initially calling for TikTok to be banned during his first term, Trump has reversed his stance on the popular video-sharing app and delayed the ban three times so far.Posting on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump said a deal was "reached on a 'certain' company that young people in our country very much wanted to save. They will be very happy! I will be speaking to President Xi on Friday. The relationship remains a very strong one!!!"There had been expectations that the deadline, which was due to expire on Wednesday, might be extended for a fourth time. Although Trump was highly critical of TikTok during his first term in the White House, he softened his position after he gained popularity on the app during the 2024 presidential election.In August, The White House launched its official TikTok account.The app is one of the world's most widely-used social media platforms, with around 170 million users in the US.Why has Trump postponed the TikTok ban?What tariffs has Trump announced and why?TikTokInternational BusinessTrump tariffsChinaNvidiaDonald TrumpTradeRelatedUS says 'framework' for TikTok ownership deal agreed with ChinaHow line dancing became cool again - from village hall to TikTok crazeCan boomers decipher zoomer slang?More from the BBC47 mins agoDemocratic New York governor endorses Zohran Mamdani for NYC mayorSome establishment Democrats have been uneasy about the 33-year-old's left-wing platform. 47 mins ago2 hrs agoTrump says Venezuela 'sending drugs, gang members' as tensions riseTension has been running high between the two countries since the US deployed war ships to the South Caribbean.2 hrs ago6 hrs agoTrump vows tough action after beheading of Indian motel managerChandra Mouli Nagamallaiah was attacked with a machete by his co-worker, who is an illegal Cuban immigrant. 6 hrs ago6 hrs agoBrazil's Lula hits back at Trump over Bolsonaro trial and tariffsIn an essay, he says Brazil's democracy and sovereignty "are not on the table" after clashes with the White House.6 hrs ago7 hrs agoDonald Trump's UK state visit is this week - here's what we knowUS President Donald Trump and his wife Melania will carry out their second UK state visit in September.7 hrs agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
