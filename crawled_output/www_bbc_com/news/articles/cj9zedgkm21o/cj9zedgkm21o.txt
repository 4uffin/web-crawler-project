Or we may… I don't know. It depends. Up to China, it doesn't matter too much."It came as expectations grow that the deadline, which is due to expire on Wednesday, will be extended for a fourth time.Last month, Trump suggested that he would keep extending the deadline until a buyer for TikTok could be found and called national security and privacy concerns related to the app and its Chinese parent company ByteDance "highly overrated".The BBC has contacted the White House and TikTok for comment.The app is one of the world's most widely-used social media platforms, with around 170 million users in the US.During this week's talks, officials are also expected to lay the groundwork for a potential meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping as soon as October, when they are scheduled to attend a summit in South Korea.China and the US extended a tariff truce until November, reducing threatened levies that exceeded 100% on each other's goods. The extension gives more time for negotiations about "unfair trade practices" and to address national security issues, the White House said.TikTokInternational BusinessTrump tariffsChinaDonald TrumpTradeRelatedHow line dancing became cool again - from village hall to TikTok crazeCan boomers decipher zoomer slang?Ban social media for under-15s, says French report warning of TikTok risksMore from the BBC4 hrs agoUS farmers are being squeezed - and it's testing their deep loyalty to TrumpWhy so many corn belt Americans continue to back Trump, even while feeling economic pressure driven partly by his trade policy4 hrs ago5 hrs agoWhy hackers are targeting the world's shippingCargo ships are increasingly coming under cyber attack by criminal gangs and hostile nation states.5 hrs ago12 hrs agoPrince Andrew needs to be fully investigated, Giuffre family saysVirginia Guiffre, one of Jeffrey Epstein's most prominent victims, alleged she was abused by the prince three times.12 hrs ago17 hrs agoNetanyahu is only obstacle to bringing hostages home, families say
