Or we may… I don't know. It depends. Up to China, it doesn't matter too much."It came as expectations grow that the deadline, which is due to expire on Wednesday, will be extended for a fourth time.Last month, Trump suggested that he would keep extending the deadline until a buyer for TikTok could be found and called national security and privacy concerns related to the app and its Chinese parent company ByteDance "highly overrated".Trump was highly critical of TikTok during his first term in the White House but softened his position after he gained popularity on the app during the 2024 presidential election.In August, The White House launched its official TikTok account.The app is one of the world's most widely-used social media platforms, with around 170 million users in the US.During this week's talks, officials are also expected to lay the groundwork for a potential meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping as soon as October, when they are scheduled to attend a summit in South Korea.The tariffs truce between China and the US cut import taxes that had reached more than 100% on each other's goods. The extension gave them more time for negotiations about "unfair trade practices" and to address national security issues, the White House said.Why has Trump postponed the TikTok ban?What tariffs has Trump announced and why?TikTokInternational BusinessTrump tariffsChinaDonald TrumpTradeRelatedHow line dancing became cool again - from village hall to TikTok crazeCan boomers decipher zoomer slang?Ban social media for under-15s, says French report warning of TikTok risksMore from the BBC26 mins agoDonald Trump's UK state visit is this week - here's what we knowUS President Donald Trump and his wife Melania will carry out their second UK state visit in September.26 mins ago2 hrs agoTrump vows tough action after beheading of Indian motel managerChandra Mouli Nagamallaiah was attacked with a machete by his co-worker, who is an illegal Cuban immigrant. 2 hrs ago3 hrs agoSouth Korea to probe potential human rights abuses in US raidMore than 300 South Korean workers returned home on Friday after being held for a week in the US following the raid.3 hrs ago3 hrs agoWindsor businesses hope Trump trip boosts tradePubs and cafe owners welcome US president's second visit to the Berkshire town.3 hrs ago9 hrs agoUS farmers are being squeezed - and it's testing their deep loyalty to TrumpWhy so many corn belt Americans continue to back Trump, even while feeling economic pressure driven partly by his trade policy9 hrs agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
