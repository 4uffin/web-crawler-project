On 20 June, the judge ruled Mr Khalil must be released. While detained, Mr Khalil's wife, a US citizen, gave birth to their son.In March, the US government also accused Mr Khalil of leaving out details of his previous associations on immigration documentation, including membership of Unwra - the UN agency that works with Palestinians - and "continuing employment" at the British Embassy in Beirut.Responding to the recent decision, Mr Khalil added: "When their first effort to deport me was set to fail, they resorted to fabricating baseless and ridiculous allegations in a bid to silence me for speaking out and standing firmly with Palestine, demanding an end to the ongoing genocide."In June, Mr Khalil's lawyers filed a claim for $20m (£14.7m) in damages alleging false imprisonment, malicious prosecution and being smeared as an antisemite.Trump has repeatedly alleged that pro-Palestinian activists, including Mr Khalil, support Hamas, a group designated a terrorist organisation by the US. The president argues these protesters should be deported and called Mr Khalil's arrest "the first of many to come".Mr Khalil's role in Columbia's 2024 protests placed him in the public eye. On the front lines of negotiations, he played a role in mediating between university officials and the activists and students who attended the protests.Activists supporting Israel have accused Mr Khalil of being a leader of Columbia University Apartheid Divest (Cuad), a student group that demanded, among other things, the university to divest from its financial ties to Israel and a ceasefire in Gaza.Mr Khalil has denied that he led the group, telling the Associated Press (AP) that he only served as a spokesperson for protesters and as a mediator with the university.Who is Mahmoud Khalil, Palestinian student activist facing US deportation?Mahmoud Khalil files $20m claim against Trump administrationIsrael-Gaza warDonald TrumpUnited StatesRelatedOne hellscape to another: Gazans tell of dire conditions in Israeli-declared humanitarian zoneFirst students evacuated from Gaza to study in UKTogether for Palestine fundraiser edges closer to £2m targetMore from the BBC27 mins agoUS prosecutor resigns after Trump says 'I want him out'Erik Siebert was investigating accusations of mortgage fraud against Trump adversary Letitia James.27 mins ago46 mins agoWhat does the FCC do - and can it revoke a TV network's licence?The suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's show has triggered concerns about the US communications regulator's power over TV networks. 46 mins ago59 mins agoSikh granny's arrest by US immigration sparks community angerHarjit Kaur, a 73-year-old who unsuccessfully applied for asylum, was arrested by immigration authorities last week.59 mins ago59 mins agoTrump says Xi approves of TikTok deal as leaders plan South Korea meetingThe president hailed "progress" during a phone call with Xi and said that he also would travel to China next year.59 mins ago1 hr agoSenator Ted Cruz says US broadcast regulator acted like 'mafioso' on Jimmy Kimmel The Texas senator affected a mobster accent to criticise how ABC was pressed to take action on the late-night host.1 hr agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
