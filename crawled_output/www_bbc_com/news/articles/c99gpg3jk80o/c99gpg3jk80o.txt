"I'm not his spokesperson," he added, noting that he has doctorates in Zulu music and cultural tourism."I have nothing personal against the king."On the question of stick-fighting, he said this was part of Zulu culture but those fighting had to be equals and "I'm not equal to the king".The 64-year-old professor also said he had not done any stick-fighting since before he was a teenager.King Misuzulu was crowned in 2022, after a year-long feud following the death of his father, long-time King Goodwill Zwelithini, and then his mother shortly afterwards.Two of his brothers challenged Misuzulu's claim to the throne but he has been recognised by both the Zulu royal household and the South African state.The throne has no formal political power, but about a fifth of South Africa's 64 million people are Zulu and its monarchy remains hugely influential with a yearly taxpayer-funded budget of more than $4.9m (£3.5m).The Zulu kingdom has a proud history. It is world-famous for defeating British troops during the 1879 battle of Isandlwana.You may also be interested in:How royal divorce papers have shaken the Zulu kingdomThe pomp and celebrations as new Zulu king crownedDeath of a Zulu king: 'He is planted, not buried'Getty Images/BBCGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.Follow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafricaBBC Africa podcastsFocus on AfricaThis Is AfricaSouth AfricaAfricaRelatedEngland and South Africa draw T20 series after washoutRecord-breaking Salt helps England to historic win against South AfricaCentury for Salt on record-breaking night for EnglandMore from the BBC51 mins ago'The hungry can't stay silent' - behind deadly protests in oil-rich AngolaAs the 50th independence anniversary approaches the country grapples with poverty and inequality.51 mins ago10 hrs agoChinese-linked mining firms sued over 'ecological catastrophe' in ZambiaMillion of litres of highly acidic waste spilled into rivers in a copper-mining area, farmers say. 10 hrs ago11 hrs agoFears balloon of a return to civil war in South Sudan over treason trialThe political rift that could spiral into conflict again after the vice-president was accused of treason.11 hrs ago12 hrs agoMalawians await presidential poll result in vote dominated by economic woesIf no candidate wins more than half the votes, the top two contenders will head to a run-off.12 hrs ago12 hrs agoWhat is at stake in Malawi's elections as cost-of-living bites?Campaigns were overshadowed by price rises and fuel shortages.12 hrs agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
