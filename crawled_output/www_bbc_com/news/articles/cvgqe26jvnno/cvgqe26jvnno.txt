Why do Channel migrants want to come to the UK?Record number of lone children on small boatsThe policy is part of a number of measures unveiled by the Labour government in an attempt to tackle the small boats crossings from France.In July, it announced that 25 people including gang leaders and small boat suppliers had had their assets frozen and been banned from travelling to the UK. An extra 300 National Crime Agency officers will target the people-smugglers arranging the crossings, and a new Border Security Command body will work closely with the Home office, police, immigration enforcement and intelligence agencies. The UK is also paying France almost £500m over three years - as agreed by the previous Conservative government - to fund extra officers on the French coast.Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to keep up with the inner workings of Westminster and beyond.FranceEnglish ChannelRelatedBan social media for under-15s, says French report warning of TikTok risksFrance suspects foreign intelligence over pigs heads left outside mosquesChildren feared among three dead in Channel crossing attemptMore from the BBC6 days agoHow many people cross the Channel in small boats?Sir Keir Starmer has promised to "smash the gangs" which smuggle people across the English Channel.6 days ago7 days agoWoman dies trying to cross Channel in migrant boatAbout 500 people are believed to have made the crossing on Tuesday in calm conditions.7 days ago8 days agoUK could suspend visas for countries with no migrant return dealsNew Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said her 'top priority' in her role is to 'secure' the UK's borders.8 days ago5 Sep 2025Refugee says national flags do not intimidate himA refugee from South Sudan living in Shrewsbury believes nations should fly their flags with pride.5 Sep 20251 Sep 2025Channel crossing after 20 years away from swimmingThe father-of-two said he was overjoyed to have completed the challenge which raised £9,500.1 Sep 2025British Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
