One male passenger died in hospital after being found seriously ill when the vessel was intercepted, according to police. Those on board included people from Senegal, Guinea, Mali, Gambia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea-Bissau, local media reported.All 19 suspects are in pretrial detention facing charges of facilitating irregular immigration, homicide, assault and torture.Spain is one of the frontline entry points for irregular migration into Europe, with most entering via the Canary Islands.Almost 47,000 migrants reached the archipelago in 2024, setting a record for a second year, but numbers have been far lower so far this year, the Spanish Interior Ministry said.Small boat migrant crossings hit 50,000 under LabourHow many people cross the Channel in small boats?SpainEurope migrant crisisMigrationRelatedSpain counts the cost of 'nightmare' wildfire summerSpanish PM calls for Israel to be barred from international sportFamily's anger as Benidorm death ruled accidentalMore from the BBC11 hrs agoMahmood vows to fight 'last-minute claims' against migrant deportationsHome Secretary Shabana Mahmood said attempts to block removals "are intolerable" and threaten the government's plans.11 hrs ago15 hrs agoIs the UK-France migrants returns deal workable?An Eritrean man managed to temporarily block his removal to France - is the government facing a stumbling block or a more serious problem?15 hrs ago1 day agoAsylum seekers would have right to work - DaveyThe Liberal Democrat leader says allowing asylum seekers to work would allow them to contribute.1 day ago4 days agoMosque marks 40 years by expanding workThe building is being relaunched as the Suffolk Muslim Centre.4 days ago8 days agoChildren feared among three dead in Channel crossing attemptCalais authorities say the three who died were likely crushed to the bottom of the boat.8 days agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
