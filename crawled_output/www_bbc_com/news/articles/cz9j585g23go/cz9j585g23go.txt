mostly South Korean nationals - were arrested at a Hyundai-operated plant, in what marked the largest single-location immigration raid since US President Donald Trump launched a crackdown on illegal migrants earlier this year.ICE officials said the South Koreans had overstayed their visas or were not permitted to work in the US.A South Korean worker who witnessed the raid told the BBC of panic and confusion as federal agents descended on the site, with some people being led away in chains.Trump has said foreign workers sent to the country are "welcome" and he doesn't want to "frighten off" investors.The US needs to learn from foreign experts of fields like shipbuilding, chipmaking and computing, Trump said on his Truth Social platform on Sunday."We welcome them, we welcome their employees, and we are willing to proudly say we will learn from them, and do even better than them at their own 'game,' sometime in the not too distant future," he said.Human rightsInternational BusinessHyundai Motor CompanyUS immigrationSouth KoreaUnited StatesRelatedIsrael has committed genocide in Gaza, UN commission of inquiry says'True hero' wins BBC Jersey Make a Difference AwardVolunteer opens home to human rights abuse victimsMore from the BBCJust nowFacebook owner unveils new range of AI-powered smart glassesThe event comes as Meta faces ongoing scrutiny over the impact of its products, particularly on children.Just now37 mins agoBody found in car registered to D4vd identified as missing teenAuthorities say the cause and time of the 15-year-old girl's death are still unknown.37 mins ago45 mins agoControversial church leader denies bribing ex-South Korea first ladyThe church is accused of bribing former first lady Kim Keon Hee with Chanel bags and a diamond necklace.45 mins ago1 hr agoJimmy Kimmel taken off air over Charlie Kirk commentsThe late-night host said on Monday that Trump's allies were "doing everything they can to score political points from" Kirk's death.1 hr ago1 hr agoAir India crash victims' families sue aerospace firms Boeing and HoneywellThey accuse the manufacturers of doing "nothing" despite being aware of the plane's risks.1 hr agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
