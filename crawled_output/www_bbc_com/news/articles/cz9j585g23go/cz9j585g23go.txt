mostly South Korean nationals - were arrested at a Hyundai-operated plant, in what marked the largest single-location immigration raid since US President Donald Trump launched a crackdown on illegal migrants earlier this year.ICE officials said the South Koreans had overstayed their visas or were not permitted to work in the US.A South Korean worker who witnessed the raid told the BBC of panic and confusion as federal agents descended on the site, with some people being led away in chains.Trump has said foreign workers sent to the country are "welcome" and he doesn't want to "frighten off" investors.The US needs to learn from foreign experts of fields like shipbuilding, chipmaking and computing, Trump said on his Truth Social platform on Sunday."We welcome them, we welcome their employees, and we are willing to proudly say we will learn from them, and do even better than them at their own 'game,' sometime in the not too distant future," he said.Human rightsInternational BusinessHyundai Motor CompanyUS immigrationSouth KoreaUnited StatesRelated'True hero' wins BBC Jersey Make a Difference AwardVolunteer opens home to human rights abuse victimsUS says UK human rights have worsened in past yearMore from the BBCJust nowChina accuses Nvidia of violating anti-monopoly lawsThe accusation comes as the US and China hold talks to de-escalate the trade war between the two.Just now3 hrs agoKirk suspect 'not co-operating' with authorities, governor saysHe adds that "much more evidence and information" will become available once charges are filed in the case.3 hrs ago3 hrs agoTrump vows tough action after beheading of Indian motel managerChandra Mouli Nagamallaiah was attacked with a machete by his co-worker, who is an illegal Cuban immigrant. 3 hrs ago3 hrs agoBrazil's Lula hits back at Trump over Bolsonaro trial and tariffsIn an essay, he says Brazil's democracy and sovereignty "are not on the table" after clashes with the White House.3 hrs ago4 hrs agoDonald Trump's UK state visit is this week -
