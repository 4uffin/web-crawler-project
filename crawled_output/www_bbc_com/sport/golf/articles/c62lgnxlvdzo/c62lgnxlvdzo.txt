But when you start playing under tournament conditions you start seeing a little of those nuances."US Open champion JJ Spaun and Russell Henley are best placed of the remaining eight Ryder Cup players on nine under.Griffin, a captain's pick who will make his debut at the Ryder Cup, said: "I've got to have that chasing mindset as a leader because I know all those guys behind me are going to stay aggressive and I've got to do everything I can to stay in front."Related topicsGolfComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 41Top storiesLive.Â Premier League reaction: How Liverpool stayed top with another late show7648 viewing7.6k viewingLive.Â World Athletics Championships 2025: 400m hurdles heats before Duplantis goes for gold10035 viewing10k viewingHatton's 'heart as big as his smile' says familyPublished51 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCAcclaimed period mystery with an all-star castHow the 1933 Enabling Act gave Adolf Hitler unchecked powerA challenging story of sexual identity starring Brian CoxSpinal Tap: The legendary comic band reunite after 40 yearsElsewhere in SportWhy Man Utd's problem is not the system, it's the personnel'There is, and always will be, only one Ricky Hatton'Red Roses master conditions and sidestep Scots to set up France semi-finalThe world of boxing remembers legend Hatton.
