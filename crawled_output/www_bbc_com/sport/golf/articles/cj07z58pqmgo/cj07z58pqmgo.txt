* denotes amateurFull leaderboardWorld number one Scottie Scheffler warmed up for this month's Ryder Cup by powering to victory in the PGA Tour's Procore Championship.The American fired a closing five-under-par 67 to finish one shot in front of Ryder Cup team-mate Ben Griffin on a 19-under total of 269 at Silverado in Napa, California.Griffin, who started the day with a one-shot lead, had a chance to force a play-off but could not make his birdie attempt on the 18th from six feet.It is four-time major winner Scheffler's sixth title of the year and he will spearhead the United States' bid to regain the Ryder Cup against Europe in New York from 26 September."I think we're all excited for the Ryder Cup to get here," said the 29-year-old."The thing I always focus on most going into tournaments is my preparation."When I step up on the first tee, I can tell myself I did everything I could to play well. I definitely feel that way going into the Ryder Cup, and I'm excited to get it started."Scheffler carded six birdies and just one bogey on the final day to finish on top of a field containing 10 of US Ryder Cup captain Keegan Bradley's 12 players.He made his first birdie with an 11-foot putt at the third and picked up further shots at the fifth and par-three seventh, thanks to a 26-foot putt.Three more birdies on the back nine were enough to hold off Griffin, who finished one shot in front of fellow American Lanto Griffin.Another of Bradley's Bethpage Park rookies, US Open champion JJ Spaun, closed with a six-under 66 to finish sixth.That was one shot behind Argentina's Emiliano Grillo and amateur Jackson Koivun, who underlined his status as a superstar in the making with a share of fourth one week after helping the US retain the Walker Cup.Related topicsGolfTop storiesLive.Â Champions League returns & Phil McNulty Q&A coming up3720 viewing3.7k viewingWho will win Champions League?
