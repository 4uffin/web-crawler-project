We qualified off our own bat - I think we are in a really strong position."It's really nice to have the same group of girls that were there before, and it's great to have some insight from Fran."Japan are also without their number one player after Naomi Osaka withdrew following her run to the US Open semi-finals."I think we've got a real shot at [winning] it," captain Keothavong said."We are the second seeds here, having reached the semi-finals twice in the past few years and come close to going further."Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Katie Boulter (left) and Sonay Kartal helped Great Britain reach the Billie Jean King Cup FinalsEmotional Raducanu beats Cristian in Korea OpenPublished1 day agoDefending champions Italy battle into BJK Cup semisPublished2 days agoMeet the GB team going for maiden BJK Cup titlePublished9 hours agoKartal and Burrage played alongside Boulter in the Hague in April, when GB beat Germany and hosts the Netherlands to qualify for this week's eight-team finals.Raducanu missed those ties for a training block in Los Angeles with Mark Petchey, who was coaching her at the time."It's obviously disappointing, but I do want the main focus to be on the players I have and the challenge we have ahead," Keothavong added."I believe in the players that I've got. How the team were able to perform in April to get us into this position was fantastic, and I see no reason why we can't do the same."Players will make decisions they feel is in their best interest, but my focus is just on this team."We take a huge amount of pride in this competition and we do want to be world champions."Related topicsTennisMore on this storyLive scores, results and order of playGet tennis news sent straight to your phonePublished16 AugustTop storiesIs Rashford on road to redemption at Barcelona after sinking Newcastle?Published1 hour agoHaaland feats 'unheard of' - how striker broke another recordPublished2 hours agoHowe praises Newcastle 'heart' - but it only takes them so farPublished1 hour agoElsewhere on the BBCQueen's unmissable Proms performanceMartin Lewis answers your questions on the state pensionInvestigating a disappearance from a luxury Caribbean yachtWhy is it difficult to portray sport on screen?Elsewhere in Sport'Slot-age time' - breaking down Liverpool's late successRashford stars for Barcelona as they beat Newcastle
