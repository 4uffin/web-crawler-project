Cordell Tinch is tall and rangy. That is a big advantage. He is silky smooth when he is flying. His technique and rhythm is so smooth and that is what makes Cordell outstanding. That was only 60% effort from him as well. It is nice when you can just cruise through these first few rounds.

Dylan Beard is going to have to improve his start. He got himself into the set position very late. The timing and rhythm was good but he will need to step up on his time. He will manage that in the semi-finals to get a tenth of a second down. These hurdles are unforgiving and if you hit, then you suffer.

Image source, Getty ImagesCan Grant Holloway turn his form around?The American hurdler has won the last three world championships in this event along with the Olympic title in Paris, but has had a difficult year. The 27-year-old came last in his opening Diamond League race in
China, fifth in his next outing in Paris and has lost to fellow
Americans in his two subsequent international races.He may have opened the door for two team-mates - Cordell Tinch, 25, and JaâKobe Tharp, 19. Tinch is the joint-fourth fastest sprint hurdler in history, but missed out on selection for last year's Olympics at US trials. Tharp, junior world champion last year, won the national title in June.Meanwhile last month Rachid Muratake became the first Japanese athlete to break 13 seconds in the 110m hurdles, while Tade Ojora lines up for Great Britain in heat two.
