Very controlled running from Karsten Warholm. He would have had orders from the coach to not use too much energy. But he has done a job.Athletes will look at who is in their race and assess what needs to be done. When you are as good as Warholm you can do that. He has the knowledge that he can go sub 47 seconds if necessary.

No Japanese athletes on the track, but huge cheers? That can only mean one thing.Mondo Duplantis is announced to the crowd before the start of the men's pole vault final, and what a treat those with a seat around the top bend of the track have in store this evening.Sweden's megastar is not one to downplay expectations and, when asked about whether we should expect to see a world record tonight, replied: "I feel like it's on the cards."You could drive a bus through the gap between Duplantis and the bar as he soars over on his first attempt at 5.55 metres.We can all be forgiven for feeling a little excited, then.Image source, Reuters

Brazil's Alison Dos Santos speaking to BBC Sport after finishing second in his men's 400m hurdles heat: "In the first heat, it is important to feel the race and the body and just analyse everything. The weather is complicated. It is hot over here but you have to adjust. "The track is amazing. It is so good to run on. "I feel in good form. I feel ready and I am here to fight for the gold and run fast."Image source, Getty Images

The stadium is taking a little longer to fill up this evening and it's definitely not the sell-out crowd of the opening two nights.You couldn't really tell as the crowd cheer on their home athletes in the first few men's 400m hurdles heats of the evening, though.That lower turnout could be explained by the fact that today is a national holiday in Japan, when the nation's elderly citizens are celebrated and honoured during Respect for the Aged Day.Hopefully those with plans elsewhere were still able to catch a glimpse of Tyri Donovan's epic dive across the line to qualify in a personal best just in front of us there. That's giving everything, and some! On a day for the aged, a dive for the ages...Image source, Getty Images

Bassem Hemeida of Qatar takes first place in the second heat with a finishing time of 48.43 seconds. The 2022 world champion Alison dos Santos of Brazil takes an easy second place.

Image source, Getty ImagesSimply put, Armand Duplantis is the rock star of the pole vault.The 25-year-old American-born Swedish athlete has dominated the event since he first broke the world record in 2020.Duplantis has set 13 world records in the last five years - increasing the record by one centimetre each time - the most recent in August when he cleared 6.29m at the Hungarian Grand Prix.The closest anyone has come to challenging Duplantis this season was when Emmanouil Karalis cleared 6.08m in August 2025.So Duplantis is more than 20 centimetres ahead of the rest - and will fancy himself to set a new world record of 6.30m at the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo.

A solid performance from Great Britain's Tyri Donovan. His lunge on the line was absolutely brilliant, he fully committed. Hopefully there is not too much wrong after that. The quality in 400m hurdles is huge. You have to expect that standard at the World Championships but it can be intimidating.

Upon hearing his name, the 25-year-old emulated the character Glinda's 'toss toss' of her hair from the film Wicked, before showing the camera with kisses and a love heart. The rest is history. His pre-race routines are "never pre-planned", nor did he begin then with social media fame in mind. Rather, it is part of his commitment to being his "authentic self" after years of battling anxiety around competitions. Now enjoying his most successful season to date, including becoming the fifth-fastest British man over 400m hurdles in July, he is ready for his first World Championships."Last year, I had a really tough year. No matter how ready I was physically, mentally I wasn't," he told BBC Sport. "Being my authentic self has brought me to a point where I feel comfortable again."My main target has been to get back competing and back to a place of enjoyment. Moments like this don't come around too often. I really want to relish it."You can read the full interview here.

Image source, Getty ImagesWhen trying to work out who might win a medal in the men's 400m hurdles, three names leap off the page.Prior to the Tokyo Olympics final four years ago, Kevin Young's world record time of 46.78 seconds had stood for three decades.Now it is only the 25th-quickest time ever, with Karsten Warholm, Rai Benjamin and Alison dos Santos responsible for the top 24.Norway's Warholm holds the world record (45.94) and is the reigning world champion, but he was pipped to gold in last summer's Olympic final by Benjamin, and was soundly beaten by both Benjamin and Dos Santos in Stockholm in June.Benjamin has since claimed that he "had a lot left in the tank during that final," so the competition between himself and Warholm will be fascinating.Don't forget about Dos Santos though - the Brazilian took bronze in Paris last summer, and finished fifth at the 2023 World Championships just 38 days after making his comeback from knee surgery. The 6ft 7' Brazilian is looking back to his best.Which of this trio will come out on top is anybody's guess.

It is hugely devastating for Molly Caudery. After the disappointment in Paris and not even making her opening jump and now this. She has had a good season and has been jumping well. You rarely see occasions like this where you have done everything and you are prepping and then an injury happens. She needs a good team around her to get her through these feelings of doubt. A reminder that Caudery's dream of winning world pole vault gold was ruined by injury in the overnight session.
