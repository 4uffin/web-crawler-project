I have been dreaming of this moment," said Jefferson-Wooden, who will also chase 200m and relay glory in Tokyo."Instead of putting the pressure on myself and taking it as something overwhelming, I was just embracing it. "Today was all about me, about trusting my abilities, my coach, the line I have been given, and my faith. And just trusting that I was prepared for this moment."Jefferson-Wooden has reached the pinnacle seven years after she put her sporting ambitions on hold to save her dad's life, stepping forward as a stem cell donor when he was diagnosed with a rare blood condition in 2018.It remains to be seen how her small home city of Georgetown in South Carolina will mark this occasion, after a day was named in her honour following her Olympic achievements.Full World Athletics Championships resultsSeville delivers on his promiseTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.This video can not be playedMedia caption, Seville and Thompson snatch gold and silver for JamaicaJust 0.01 seconds had separated the leading trio in the semi-finals - Kenny Bednarek, Thompson and Seville - with all eight qualifiers needing to run under 10 seconds to progress to the final.While a staredown shared between Bednarek and Thompson as they crossed the line together in their semi increased excitement among the crowd, Seville raised a finger to his lips as he won the following heat.Less than two hours later, as Bolt applauded, Seville silenced questions over his ability to handle the big occasions amid the wait for his long-anticipated golden moment."To win this gold medal is something special to me," he said."Track and field is both mental and physical. But, to be honest, I think I have mastered the mental part of it. "Other people are doing and talking about other things, but I just focus on me and that is why I managed to get this victory."As three-time Olympic 100m champion Bolt watched on, Seville at last delivered the crowning moment his talent has long promised.Dethroned champion Lyles was never in contention for gold. Instead, it was compatriot Thompson, the fastest man in the world this year with a best of 9.75, who remained Seville's biggest threat to the very end.Seville was last in the fastest 100m race in history at last summer's Games, and narrowly missed out on the podium at the previous World Championships in 2023 - but he was not to be denied this time.Under the guidance of Bolt's former coach, Glen Mills, Seville will hope this is just the start - as will his nation, with its sprinting prowess revived.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Oblique Seville won gold after finishing fourth at the previous World ChampionshipsRelated topicsAthleticsComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 135Top storiesLive.Â Champions League: Arsenal visit Athletic Club on opening night of competition9105 viewing9.1k viewingKipyegon wins historic fourth world 1500m goldPublished2 hours agoLawyers, losses and lie detectors - inside Mudryk doping casePublished3 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCRevealing the secrets of our speciesThe photo that exposed a scandalous fake injuryThe gang who stole over Â£50 million from taxpayersIan Wright remembers an inspirational teacherElsewhere in SportWho will win Champions League?
