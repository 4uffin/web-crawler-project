Ingebrigtsen, a two-time Olympic and world champion, has endured an injury-disrupted season and did not race for six months prior to these championships."I was terrible," Ingebrigtsen told BBC Sport."The race itself was perfect, especially how it turned out, it was gifted to me. "Unfortunately I have lost too much and I have not been able to prepare."Of course I'm disappointed but it's a reality check that it was never really going to happen. I was holding on for dear life because I love to compete."I've been glued to the floor unfortunately. I've not been able to do what is needed, clearly. I just have to look forward."Recap day two of World Athletics Championships as Jefferson-Wooden & Seville crowned 100m championsEx-English schools champion makes history for UruguayPublished2 days agoGB miss out on first medal on opening night in TokyoPublished3 days ago'Fair play to Ingebrigtsen - but it's a 12-horse race'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Jakob Ingebrigtsen will also contest the men's 5,000m in TokyoBritain's defending champion Kerr, Wightman and Neil Gourley safely progressed - and saw their medal hopes boosted further as Frenchman Azeddine Habz and talented Kenyan teenager Phanuel Koech - the two fastest 1500m runners this year - both also exited the competition.The men's 1500m semi-finals take place on Monday (13:30 BST), with the final on Wednesday."I am coming here as someone who's done it before and I am coming to do it again," said Kerr, who qualified safely in second in his heat.Speaking before Ingebrigtsen's race, Kerr added: "I don't care who gets through the rounds. The best guys are going to make the final and I'll deal with who I'm going to deal with come Wednesday, but tomorrow night's my number one priority."Wightman, prevented from contesting the past two global championships since his world triumph in 2022 because of injuries, won the heat in which Ingebrigtsen missed out."I thought because [Ingebrigtsen] was going to race, he'd be absolutely rolling. I don't think anyone else could have stepped on a start line at a world champs having not raced at all," Wightman said."I couldn't do it, so fair play to him. It's not even him that is the big danger anymore. It's not just a one or two-horse race, it's probably going to be a 12-horse race by the time the final comes around."How Hodgkinson found strength in 'most challenging year'Published5 days agoWorld Athletics Championships - everything you need to knowPublished6 days agoThe must-watch events at the World ChampionshipsPublished8 SeptemberIngebrigtsen struggles after season in 'pitch-dark injury cellar'While Ingebrigtsen began the season by breaking the world indoor 1500m and mile records in the same race in February, and won 1500m and 3,000m golds at the World Indoor Championships one month later, an Achilles issue has prevented him from competing since.Ingebrigtsen described that period as "pitch dark" before the championships, speaking to Norwegian broadcaster NRK."I have taken the trip down to the injury cellar several times this spring. It has been pitch dark there," he said."This is more or less the worst case scenario for me because I have had to sit home and watch the whole season go by."Away from the track, the trial of Ingebrigtsen's father took place earlier this year, with Gjert Ingebrigtsen cleared of abusing his son but found guilty of violence against his daughter, Ingrid.Ingebrigtsen will return for the 5,000m heats on Friday - the event in which he has won the past three global titles and believes he is currently better placed to succeed in.'Talent alone isn't enough'ByJenny MeadowsFormer 800m World Championship medallistJakob Ingebrigtsen was in sensational form indoors, getting the 1500m and one-mile world records. When you start a World Championship year like that, you can only dream of where it's going to end.He has been so difficult to beat for so long but when you don't have the training, you just cannot compete with the rest of the world because they've had consistent and uninterrupted training.It just shows that talent alone isn't enough, you have to get those weeks and months of consistent training in.Related topicsAthleticsTop stories'Difficult to explain' - Juventus 4-4 Dortmund after remarkable second halfAn Arsenal win made from the bench - and inspired by rugby unionPublished4 hours ago'Clean sheet mentality' - pragmatism proving key for TottenhamPublished2 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCRevealing the secrets of our speciesThe photo that exposed a scandalous fake injuryThe gang who stole over Â£50 million from taxpayersIan Wright remembers an inspirational teacherElsewhere in SportWho will win Champions League?
