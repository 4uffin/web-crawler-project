Mike: Very confident display and showed the great benefit of Arsenal's active transfer period. The new boys all acquitted themselves extremely well. Keep up this excellent start and we will have a real chance of total success.Vince: What a complete victory and to think the new boys haven't had much time to bed in. If all goes well, the second half of the season should prove to be great watching for us Gooners!Ryan: Last year, losing Saka, Havertz, Saliba and Odegaard (plus no Rice) would have probably led to a shaky win or, more likely, dropped points. The strength in the squad now means that four definite starters are not missed. Get through this tough first three months of the season close to the top and Arsenal will be in good shape.Phoenix: A good way to forget the loss at Anfield - good ball play from the guys. Just happy for Viktor Gyokeres and Zubimendi is a colossus of a player - small in nature, big in performance. Trophy is the currency that the team needs going forward.

Image source, Getty ImagesMartin Zubimendi proved to be an unlikely hero for Arsenal against Nottingham Forest, bookending the scoring with his first goals for the club, either side of a third of the season from fellow summer signing Viktor Gyokeres. While Gyokeres was brought to the Emirates to score goals, defensive midfielder Zubimendi certainly was not. But his powerful volley from the edge of the box for the opener was a thing of beauty, with or without the slight deflection that took it past the outstretched hand of Matz Sels in the Forest goal. With Noni Madueke - another new arrival - once again filling in manfully for the injured Bukayo Saka, Mikel Arteta's side flexed their muscles to briefly move top of the table, bouncing back well from their 1-0 defeat at Anfield before the international break. Mo Salah's late penalty for Liverpool at Burnley helped re-establish their three-point lead, but battle lines have most certainly been drawn.

I disagree with the description of âFergie Timeâ compared to âArne Timeâ.
Fergie Time was when Utd scored when the added time mysteriously kept going if they were losing or drawing, whereas Liverpool score late goals, but still within normal time or the allotted extra. Not the same thing.Matthew

With the possible exception of Newcastle, you'd expect Liverpool to have won all those games, so the results aren't a shock.
The manner of them is important though, they won't get away with relying on late goals all season. Although, last season we expected their rivals to start competing but they didn't, so maybe the performances won't be an issue?Dave

Liverpool's flawless start to the defence of their Premier League crown is now being aided by an aura from another age. What was once "Fergie Time" is now "Arne Time".It was a phrase used to describe the uncanny habit Sir Alex Ferguson's all-conquering Manchester United side had of breaking opponents' hearts with late, late shows.They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery â and now we have Arne Slot's Liverpool repeating the old Ferguson punishment as they relentlessly pursue victories and trophies.Liverpool's latest journey into "Arne Time" came at Turf Moor on Sunday after Scott Parker's Burnley resisted magnificently to move within seconds of becoming the first team to take points from the champions this season.And then, in the dying seconds of five minutes of added time, Burnley substitute Hannibal recklessly handled Jeremie Frimpong's cross, leaving Mohamed Salah to complete the formalities from the penalty spot.Image source, PA Media

Itâs been a
case of itâs not how you start, itâs how you finish for Liverpool so far this
season.One of four
Premier League sides yet to score in the opening half-hour of a game, they have
won all four of their matches thanks to a winning goal in the final 10 minutes
or later, setting a new record in the competition.Even at
this early stage, itâs already a contrast to last season, when they won just three
league games with winners scored in the last 10 minutes. They had just one game-winning
goal in the 90th minute or later in 2024-25 - whereas theyâve already had two in
their opening four games of 2025-26.The
difference so far this season is possibly that they have not been at their best,
and have needed to push harder in the final stages of games. Last season, they
were often well enough ahead not to need late winners - 16 of their 25 league
wins were by two or more goals.Their run
of scoring late winners will surely dry up, but the worry for their rivals is
that itâs because they might not need them.

Liverpool's win at Burnley on Sunday was their first Premier League game this season in which their xG was greater than the number of goals they scored. That means they have been pretty clinical in front of goal, converting more chances than have been expected:
4-2 v Bournemouth - 2.15
3-2 v Newcastle - 0.7
1-0 v Arsenal - 0.45
1-0 v Burnley - 2.45

Liverpool have won each of their opening four Premier League games of a season for the third time (also 2018-19 and 2019-20), already equalling the longest winning streak that they set across the whole of last season in the league (3 runs of 4 wins).Arne Slot's side are the only team in the top four tiers of English football still to have a 100% record. There's a handful of top-flight teams across Europe who are also yet to drop a point:

There has been a lot of talk about Salah and his influence in matches and how subdued he has been in certain periods.For me, I look at his output and his habits as a winger - he is in the right spaces and doing the right things, his speed, physcial output - the habits are what we always like from Sahah.His decision making in the final third is probably the biggest cause for concern in this moment of time. It's just not quite happening.I wouldn't be worried at all if I was a Liverpool fan right now. This isn't a player that is subdued right now for me.
