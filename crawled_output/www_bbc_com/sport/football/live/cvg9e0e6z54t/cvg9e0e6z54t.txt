Tactics aren't helping but does anyone really think things would be much different if they sack Amorim? Players, tactics, recruitment, the way the club is run all seem rotten. They need to fix all of them (but as an outsider I kind of hope they don't...)Mike

The subject of Ruben Amorim, his commitment to playing the same system and stubborn refusal to change at Manchester United was the focus of a heated debate in the latest episode of Football Daily.

We will go through some of the top lines from that debate here. Alternatively, listen to the whole show by clicking on this link.

City had longer and better passages of play than Utd, who only showed brief flashes of overall ability. Utd looked only marginally better than last year with evidence of a 'team bond' still missing. It's going to be hard going to hit the top 6.Nigel

Manchester United's problems appear to be at both ends. In terms of attacking, if you look at the stats for each of their four Premier League games so far this season, they have had the most possession in three of those games.Their xG in each game has also been greater than the number of goals they have scored. That means that despite spending Â£200m on three new forwards this summer, they are not converting as many chances as they are expected to:
0-1 v Arsenal - 61.1% possession, 1.59 xG, 22 shots, 7 on target
1-1 v Fulham - 47.6% possession, 1.63 xG, 10 shots, 3 on target
3-2 v Burnley - 61.8% possession, 3.54 xG, 26 shots, 6 on target
0-3 v Man City - 54.7% possession, 1.51 xG, 12 shots, 2 on target

Ruben Amorim's win rate across all competitions is the worst of any permanent Manchester United manager since World War Two and his win record is a dismal 26% in the league.Of the 17 sides who have been in the Premier League throughout since Amorim's tenure began, his United team have the worst record - alongside Tottenham - with just 31 points from 31 games."In quite a lot of league seasons that is relegation form," Former United forward Wayne Rooney told the Wayne Rooney show."What is important when you're trying to implement a new style is you win games as well while you're doing that."Rooney also echoed comments made by other former players now working in the media when he addressed Amorim's insistence on deploying two central midfielders, often against opposition sides featuring three."I have had my time as a manager, and I know how it works, and I know how it is when someone else looks and critiques your formation. I can understand that, but it is so obvious," Rooney added."If you're struggling, you have to put three in midfield and give yourself a chance to compete."Watch The Wayne Rooney Show on BBC iPlayer or listen on BBC Sounds

Former England midfielder Danny Murphy, speaking on Match of the Day: "I'm not a fan of the shape, but after the first four games I think it has improved - they look like they know what they are doing more."Their bigger problem has been the individuals he has been playing in that system. Bruno Fernandes has been one of the best number 10s in Europe, Amorim wants him to play as an 8 and do defensive work, which he does not do well."Amorim cannot put round pegs in square holes. You have got to have players who understand their role. If you are a holding midfielder in that role you have got to be able to track runners and spot dangers."The manager has to take responsibility, but in terms of just blaming the system? No. Palace play it well."To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.This video can not be playedMedia caption, Man Utd a team with round pegs in square holes - analysis

Letâs not forget it could and should have been 5-0 with the Haaland and Reijnders chances. Not sure why but Amorim looks a little lost. Maybe like Onana the United job is too big for him. Or maybe he is too conceited and the players canât take to him.Garry

Erling Haaland scored his 50th goal in his 50th home Premier League game for Manchester City. In the competition's history, only Alan Shearer required fewer home appearances to hit 50 home goals (47).

The spirit was great, our players have a lot of pride and they want to try to do better on a special day. We saw our fans so happy and that is our job, so, so privileged."We have many things to improve. We are not yet a team but step by step. The victory helps us a lot. In the games we have had a lot of momentum and others not enough."They [United] have fantastic players and I know here we struggle against them, we have more better results at Old Trafford."On Phil Foden: "He played incredible. He is a guy who loves to arrive at the box. Our last Premier League title he was the best player in the Premier League. We need him so much."The players have a lot of pride.

Remember in the build-up to this game, Ruben Amorim laughed off the suggestion that opposite number Pep Guardiola could be under as much pressure as he was. But Manchester City had fallen to back-to-back defeats before the international break. Guardiola had never led a side to two defeats in the first three matches of a league campaign before. Yet there is nothing like a 3-0 win over your city rivals to release the pressure valve. The Spaniard said the performance was all down to his players. Phil Foden enjoyed welcome return to goalscoring form. And Erling Haaland kept doing what Haaland does...Image source, Getty Images

That was the biggest difference."We suffered goals where clearly we can do better, especially the second one. We started the second half well, we're pushing for a goal to open the game, and even for 2-1 when Bryan [Mbeumo] could have scored, that moment was always for the opponent, and the third goal is hard to describe."To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.This video can not be playedMedia caption, 'We suffer goals we can avoid' - Amorim frustrated with United loss

After just four Premier League games, Opta say Manchester United now stand more chance (11%) of getting relegated this season than of finishing inside the top five (7.3%)."It concerns me," former United skipper Roy Keane told Sky Sports."This United team lack real quality.

Amorim will take us down if he continues. 31 points from 31 games in total. Relegation form. Nothing is changing. Nor does it look likely to.I pity the poor UK journalist who will have to fly out to whatever outpost Amorim ends up at next solely to see if he is still playing a 3-4-3. I suppose Glasner is the next taxi off the rank.Rich
20333Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingWhat is Amorim's playing philosophy and how is it supposed to work?published at 08:02 BST08:02 BSTMan City 3-0 Man Utd
Ruben Amorim plays a 3-4-2-1 system, asking players to stick to rigid zones. His wing-back stays wide. His central midfield stays central. There are minimal rotations within his team.In this system, Amorim aims to get the better of opponents by using overloads across the pitch.He attempts to create areas on the pitch in which his team have more players than the opponents, such as the flanks.In theory, having the extra man makes getting up the pitch into dangerous areas easier.Positionally, he looks to do this in wide areas using the wing-back, number 10, central midfielder and centre-back.

Yet again yesterday, Ruben Amorim was forced onto the back foot trying to defend his 3-4-2-1 system against the charge it is holding Manchester United back, or at least doesn't suit his players.Amorim insists it is working - and says there was evidence of that at the Etihad Stadium in the general pattern of the game. (In answer to a previous point from Ash, yes he has been asked numerous times why he won't change it, it is because he believes in it).However, United have not had a worse day against City in terms of margin of defeat since the 6-1 hammering at Old Trafford in 2011. In the end, Amorim knows results mask everything at football clubs."I
see that we are doing better but the results don't show that," he said."Last
year we played against City with my former club (Sporting). "We won 4-1 but we did not have anything near to the
opportunities, or the way we controlled the game compared to today."It is hard
and the record says everything. I understand."
