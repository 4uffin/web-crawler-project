Liverpool have won each of their opening four Premier League games of a season for the third time (also 2018-19 and 2019-20), already equalling the longest winning streak that they set across the whole of last season in the league (3 runs of 4 wins).Arne Slot's side are the only team in the top four tiers of English football still to have a 100% record. There's a handful of top-flight teams across Europe who are also yet to drop a point:
Ligue 1 - Paris St-Germain (after 4 games)
Bundesliga - Bayern Munich (after 3 games)
La Liga - Real Madrid (after 4 games)
Serie A - Napoli, Juventus (after 3 games)

There has been a lot of talk about Salah and his influence in matches and how subdued he has been in certain periods.For me, I look at his output and his habits as a winger - he is in the right spaces and doing the right things, his speed, physcial output - the habits are what we always like from Sahah.His decision making in the final third is probably the biggest cause for concern in this moment of time. It's just not quite happening.I wouldn't be worried at all if I was a Liverpool fan right now. This isn't a player that is subdued right now for me.

Former Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney wasn't particularly impressed by the latest Manchester derby. Speaking on the Wayne Rooney show, he said: "Manchester City werenât great at all today. It was one of the worst Manchester derbies I have seen in a long time and City played their part in that as well. "I think City are still trying to find their feet. They have a few new players and a couple new coaches in there as well, playing in a bit of a different style. City are finding a different way [to win], and what is important when youâre trying to implement a new style is you win games while youâre doing that. "Unfortunately for United and the manager, it has been not too far off a year now and it is less than one point a game. It is tough to watch and to see. I will try to defend it to a certain point, but I am struggling to find the words to do that at the minute."

Former England winger Theo Walcott speaking to BBC Sport about Phil Foden: "It was like a test, he hasn't really played but Pep put him in against Manchester United, one of the biggest clubs in the world."He's expected to be a presence and represent the club, but I'm not sure he's that type. He talks by playing his football."After the game Pep embraced him, he knows how important Foden is and needs to keep him onside. He's important for Haaland too."On Foden's England place: "It's a great player to have in his position, and Thomas Tuchel has a headache [about whether to play Foden]. He has all these equipped players to play similar positions, but Foden will have a part to play at the World Cup."To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.This video can not be playedMedia caption, Manchester City 3-0 Manchester United: Theo Walcott on Phil Foden

Iâm a City fan so Iâm delighted with the result, but the difference in the two teams yesterday was the finishing. Thatâs it. I genuinely think if Donnarumma doesnât make that save and it goes to 2-1, we would have folded under the pressure.AlexImage source, Getty Images

The rate at which Haaland is racking up goals will be giving those players in front of him in the Premier League charts sleepless nights.Ex-Newcastle and England striker Alan Shearer will be keeping a close eye as he leads the way with 260 goals, with Haaland currently on 90.But on Sunday, Haaland scored his 50th goal in as many home league games - with only Shearer requiring fewer, netting the same number in only 47 matches.In January, Haaland signed a new contract until 2034 and it is his scoring rate that is the frightening prospect.He has played 101 games so far and - at his current rate of scoring - would need 191 more matches to match Shearer's record, equating to just over five more full seasons in the Premier League.Image source, .

Before the Manchester derby, City manager Pep Guardiola was asked how he would compare Erling Haaland to new Liverpool striker and British record transfer Alexander Isak."A little bit above. Isak is an exceptional player, but you asked me about Erling and he is top. Isak must be a top player because of what they paid. But I wouldn't change Erling for anyone."

Haaland is absolutely lethal. If you give him the
chances and the teams give him space he can really hurt them. Haaland hasnât
played at his best level the last couple of months but at the same time, this a
team where thereâs a lot of new players and a different way they were playing
under Pep [Guardiola] at the moment.

Former Arsenal and England winger Theo Walcott, speaking to BBC Sport: "Erling Haaland's an animal. He always has a picture of any finish in that 18-yard box. Or, where he is on that field, he just knows when to go, when not to go, when to reserve his energy."It's that picture, he sees it. And I'd say any young player out there, you don't have to overthink things. He doesn't, he simplifies it. You see it with that finish [for his second goal], such a cool finish. He knew what he was going to do. The third touch he takes to set himself, he's already smiling before he's finished."In these big games, he knows when to come out of his shell. Of course, he had a great week internationally as well. He's coming back with so much confidence and he's already got an abundance of confidence anyway. He's got a presence and aura about him."Will he beat Alan Shearer's Premier League record? We'll see."Image source, Getty Images
