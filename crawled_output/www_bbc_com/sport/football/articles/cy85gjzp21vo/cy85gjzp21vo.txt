What coach says no to Benfica? Not me," Mourinho told reporters after landing in Lisbon."When I was presented with the opportunity to coach Benfica, I didn't hesitate to say that I'm interested, that I'd like to."Mourinho began his managerial career with Benfica in 2000 but took charge of only 10 games and left after a dispute with the club president.He then made his name with Porto between 2002 and 2004, winning six trophies - including the Champions League in 2003-04.Since leaving his homeland in 2004, Mourinho has managed Chelsea, Inter Milan, Real Madrid, Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur, Roma and Fenerbahce.He left the Turkish club on 29 August, two days after they were eliminated from the Champions League play-offs by Benfica.Should Benfica appoint Mourinho, he would face Chelsea in the Champions League at Stamford Bridge on 30 September.Benfica also travel to Newcastle United and host Real Madrid later in the league phase of the competition.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Jose Mourinho has won league titles in four different countriesRelated topicsEuropean FootballFootballMore on this storyListen to the latest Football Daily podcastTop storiesSlot gets late birthday gift as Isak samples power of AnfieldPublished5 hours agoSimeone 'regret' after clash with Liverpool fansPublished6 hours agoKane scores twice to ruin Chelsea's Champions League returnElsewhere on the BBCThe gang who stole over Â£50 million from taxpayersFollow the team of Prison Inspectors in OnleySarah Lancashire stars in Sally Wainwright's northern noirAl Murray asks Ian Hislop some intriguing questionsElsewhere in SportAn Arsenal win made from the bench - and inspired by rugby unionVan Dijk header snatches victory for Liverpool against Atletico.
