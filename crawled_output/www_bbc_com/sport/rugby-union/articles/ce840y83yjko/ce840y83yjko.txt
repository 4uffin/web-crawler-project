However, the committee upheld the original decision.The Berthoumieu bite occurred as Ireland won a penalty turnover in the second half of their 18-13 defeat by France at Sandy Park.Ireland captain Sam Monaghan said she raised the incident with referee Aimee Barrett-Theron, but no action was taken during the match.At the Independent Foul Play Review Committee (FPRC) hearing, it emerged the television match official could not determine "clear and obvious foul play" at the time.The FPRC was able to reach its decision with the help of written evidence as well as all broadcast angles.France were trailing 13-0 at the time of the incident but recovered to set up a last-four meeting with England at Ashton Gate.Related topicsRugby UnionMore on this storyListen: Sport's Strangest Crimes - BloodgateListen to the latest Rugby Union Weekly podcastTop storiesIs Rashford on road to redemption at Barcelona after sinking Newcastle?Published2 hours agoHaaland feats 'unheard of' - how striker broke another recordPublished2 hours agoHowe praises Newcastle 'heart' - but it only takes them so farPublished1 hour agoElsewhere on the BBCQueen's unmissable Proms performanceMartin Lewis answers your questions on the state pensionInvestigating a disappearance from a luxury Caribbean yachtWhy is it difficult to portray sport on screen?Elsewhere in Sport'Slot-age time' - breaking down Liverpool's late successRashford stars for Barcelona as they beat Newcastle
