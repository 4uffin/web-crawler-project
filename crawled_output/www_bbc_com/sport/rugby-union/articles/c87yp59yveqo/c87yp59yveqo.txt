Canada underlined their title credentials with a superb performance against Australia on Saturday.And England?Well, England cruised through the pool stages below full cylinders.While United States, Samoa and Australia were all comprehensively beaten, the Red Roses are working to their own internal higher standards.When you have won 30 straight matches, you have to.Head coach John Mitchell has pointed to a little untidiness here, some slack hands there, and periods where England have been slow to start or let up the pressure on the accelerator.On another day, under a different sky, an eager and enterprising Scotland might have been ideal opponents for England to show off the polished 80-minute, all-court performance we have yet to see at the World Cup.As it was, near-monsoon conditions on this quarter-final Sunday washed those ideas down the drain. England racked up win number 31 in their growing list and got out of here.Fly-half Holly Aitchison, given a first chance to show off her play-making, game-breaking smarts, added the bells and whistle she could.England 40-8 Scotland - Red Roses make World Cup last fourPublished2 days agoFrance comeback downs Ireland in World Cup quarter-finalPublished2 days agoWho plays who in Rugby World Cup semi-finals?Published2 days agoHer range of passing put the ever-impressive Meg Jones into a hole, before another lovely wide ball gave Abby Dow space to scamper in for her 50th England try.Aitchison slid in during the second half herself after Zoe Harrison, off the bench to reclaim the 10 shirt, slipped her a smart inside ball.On another attack, Aitchison put boot to ball, attempting to pick out Dow with a cross-field bomb.That was overcooked. And perhaps over-ambitious."She was a bit rusty early on I thought and then she grew into the match," said Mitchell of Aitchison."Then when she went to inside centre she was around that line break [that led to Scotland's late try] so there are a couple of things for her to fix up."But she is a class player, we have invested a lot of time in her over the last three years, and she showed she is ready to come back and perform at this level."To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.This video can not be playedMedia caption, England played with the handbrake off - MitchellUltimately, whatever aspirations England had to push the envelope, it made more sense to shove it up the jumper.No team is better suited to the close-quarters combat.Morwenna Talling was named player of the match, but second-row partner Rosie Galligan, crashing across the gain line again and again, can't have been far behind.Captain Zoe Aldcroft, back for the first time since the tournament opener after a knee injury, put to bed any fitness doubts with a performance of fury and accuracy.Sadia Kabeya topped the game's tackle count with 20, a remarkable statistic considering England had 55% of possession as well.Maud Muir was immense, while Kelsey Clifford filled in ably for the injured Hannah Botterman at loose-head, bashing over for two tries.Much of the focus in the build-up had been on Helena Rowland.Ellie Kildunne, whose concussion symptoms must have eased judging by the way she was whacking a pitchside drum, has more obvious stardust to her game.The step, the spurt of speed, the top-end pace are matched by few in the game.They make up the highlight-reel content that makes Kildunne a world player of the year.But Rowland has subtler gifts.The way she cut in late on one first-half pass from Jones, taking her past Scotland's Rhona Lloyd and Chloe Rollie before they had realised where they were, was a prime example.She is also alert in the backfield and, in contrast to last week where Australia poked holes with kicks, Rowland ably fielded whatever Loughborough Lightning team-mate Helen Nelson pinged her way.Mitchell enjoyed those small details and his side's pragmatism."I thought it was a terrific performance," he told BBC Sport."We put them in their own half, we kept them there and we broke them and built pressure on them with set-piece - frequently."We forced them into a lot of negative situations, they had to hang on as we kept applying pressure. We left a little bit out there, but considering the conditions, it was awesome."France dealt with similar conditions in Exeter against Ireland and, by a smaller margin, also found a way through the maelstrom. It is they who England must tackle next.The long-range forecast for next Saturday in Bristol, for what it is worth, is wet again.England have yet to prove they are a team for all seasons, but, if we get a repeat of these conditions, they won't have to be.What information do we collect from this quiz?Related topicsRugby UnionMore on this storyListen: Sport's Strangest Crimes - BloodgateListen to the latest Rugby Union Weekly podcastComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 554Top storiesLive.Â Champions League: Trossard doubles Arsenal lead against Athletic Club51297 viewing51k viewingLive.Â Carabao Cup: Build-up to Brentford v Villa, Palace v Millwall & Grimsby at Sheff Wed3325 viewing3.3k viewingKipyegon wins historic fourth world 1500m goldPublished4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCRevealing the secrets of our speciesThe photo that exposed a scandalous fake injuryThe gang who stole over Â£50 million from taxpayersIan Wright remembers an inspirational teacherElsewhere in SportWho will win Champions League?
