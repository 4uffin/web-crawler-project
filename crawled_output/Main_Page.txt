Felice Beato (c. 1832 – 1909) was an Italian-British photographer. He was one of the first to take photographs in East Asia and one of the first war photographers. He is noted for his genre works, portraits, and views and panoramas of the architecture and landscapes of Asia and the Mediterranean region. His travels let him create images of countries, people and events that were unfamiliar and remote to most people in Europe and North America. His work provides images of such events as the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and the Second Opium War, and represents the first substantial body of photojournalism. Beato was the official photographer of the Nile Expedition led by G. J. Wolseley to Khartoum, Sudan, in relief of General Charles Gordon. Beato influenced other photographers; and his impact in Japan, where he taught and worked with other photographers and artists, was particularly deep and lasting. He pioneered and refined the techniques of hand-colouring photographs and making panoramas. (Full article...)

Ninety-six episodes of My Name Is Earl, an American television sitcom created by Greg Garcia for the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), aired. The first season premiered on September 20, 2005. Three additional seasons followed before the series concluded on May 14, 2009. The series was unexpectedly cancelled, ending on a cliffhanger. The series follows the titular character, Earl Hickey (portrayed by Jason Lee), an unemployed petty thief who lives in the fictional Camden County. After he wins the jackpot on a lottery scratcher, Earl celebrates and is struck by a vehicle in a hit-and-run collision. While in the hospital, he discovers the concept of karma and decides to make a list of his bad deeds. He uses his lottery winnings to make up for them by helping the people he wronged. (Full list...)

Today's featured picture
The common ringed plover (Charadrius hiaticula) is a species of bird in the family Charadriidae. Its breeding range consists of much of northern Eurasia, as well as Greenland. It is a migratory bird and many individuals spend their winters in locations across Africa. Its breeding habitat is generally open ground on beaches or flats although some birds breed inland. They are commonly found both in low coastal plains and in cold uplands with sparse vegetation, in open habitats with little or no plant cover, where they nest on the ground. Breeding occurs from one year of age, with egg laying generally beginning around May. A clutch of three to four eggs is laid at intervals of one to three days, with the downy grey-buff chicks hatching after twenty-one to twenty-seven days. The common ringed plover forages for food on beaches, tidal flats and fields, usually by sight. It eats insects, crustaceans and worms, forages both by day and by night, and sometimes uses foot-trembling to reveal location of prey. This common ringed plover was photographed near Orkelsjøen, a lake in Oppdal, Norway.
