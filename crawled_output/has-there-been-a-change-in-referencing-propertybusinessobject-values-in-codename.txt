Has there been a change in referencing PropertyBusinessObject values in Codename One?

After months of capturing an object name from a PropertyBusinessObject value, referencing a database record and populating a record in a different database, as illustrated below in an Action Listener, getting the name object from the Activity List and using the name link between databases to build a Practice Plan, this evening the getter is giving me the error message listed below each time I try to capture and use the name and activity description objects from db 1 to populate the name action button and activity description Textfield in db 2.
mb.addActionListener(ee -> {
transName1 = ((addActivity) currentContact).name.get();
actta = ((addActivity) currentContact).activityta.get();
fltp = ((addActivity) currentContact).fieldtype.get();
pr.line3.set(actta.toString());
line4t = transName1.toString();
l4.setText("Demonstrate:
" + line4t);
pr.line12.set(fltp);
d.dispose();
});
"local variables referenced from a lambda expression must be final or effectively final"
My research this afternoon has not shed any light on the why my use of "transName1 = ((addActivity) currentContact).name.get();" now generates the error.
Does anyone have any ideas?
