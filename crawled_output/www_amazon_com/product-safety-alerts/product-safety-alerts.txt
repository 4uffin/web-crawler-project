Recalls and Product Safety Alerts
Recalls and Product Safety Alerts
Our Product Safety Team proactively investigates and addresses reported safety complaints and incidents to ensure customer protection from potential product-related safety risks. We closely monitor public recall alert websites and receive notifications from vendors and sellers. Upon discovering a product recall, we immediately halt affected product offerings, and promptly inform both customers and sellers involved about the recall.
For more information visit our
Safety Information, Recalls and Legal Notices Page
