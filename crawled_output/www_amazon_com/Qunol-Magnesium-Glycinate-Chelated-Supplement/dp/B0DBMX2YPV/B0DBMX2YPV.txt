About this item
MAGNESIUM GLYCINATE - Each serving of Qunol’s Magnesium Glycinate contains 300mg of Magnesium from Chelated Magnesium Glycinate
SUPPORTS NERVE, BONE & MUSCLE HEALTH - Magnesium plays an essential role in supporting nerve, bone, and muscle health. Magnesium, especially in magnesium glycinate form, is a crucial nutrient that supports healthy muscle and nerve function
HIGH ABSORPTION - Qunol’s Magnesium Glycinate is fully chelated, which means the magnesium is bound to an amino acid, providing a protective coating around the magnesium allowing for high absorption
GENTLE ON THE STOMACH - Other brands use magnesium oxide in order to increase the potency, however, Qunol Magnesium Glycinate only uses a single high-absorption form of magnesium that don't cause stomach distress
NO ARTIFICIAL DYES OR FLAVORS - Qunol’s Magnesium Glycinate tablets are free of artificial flavors and dyes and are gluten free, vegan, and non-GMO
