ReviewsAsus Hyper M.2 x16 Gen5 review: Four slots of SSD magic — in the right PCThough limited by motherboard bifurcation capabilities (4x4x4x4 is required for all four slots to operate), the Hyper M.2 x16 is still a handy and very affordable way to add one to four PCIe 5.0 NVMe M.2 slots to your system. 						By Jon Jacobi								16 hours ago							ReviewsPrivate Internet Access review: A low-price, high-value VPNPrivate Internet Access is a powerful, low-cost VPN that offers a good array of features, tons of customization options, and unlimited device connections.						By Sam Singleton								2 days ago							UpdatediDrive review: Excellent online backup, sharing, and moreiDrive offers online storage, sharing, file backup/sync, and more. Unless you want the functionality of an office suite, online services don't get any more comprehensive.						By Jon L. Jacobi								3 days ago							ReviewsLaCie Rugged SSD4 review: Fast, weatherized, and orangeThis USB4 external SSD is fast, rugged, and easy to spot on even the most cluttered desk — because it's orange!						By Jon Jacobi								3 days ago
ReviewsEcovacs Goat A3000 review: This mower isn't Greatest of all TimeSaddling its best robot lawn mower with the name GOAT A3000 made it all but impossible for Ecovacs to deliver the performance that badge conjures.						By Ed Oswald								5 days ago							ReviewsRazer Blade 18 review: I love this monstrous gaming laptopRazer's Blade 18 gaming laptop is a (relatively) light, quiet gaming laptop that can handle anything you want to play on it. But the battery life is horrific, and you'll probably skip over one of its key features, a dual-mode screen.						By Mark Hachman								6 days ago							ReviewsMSI Pro MP165 E6 review: A portable monitor you can slap on anythingThe MSI Pro MP165 E6 is a versatile option for shoppers who need a budget portable monitor that can be used with a VESA wall mount, a conventional monitor arm, or even a tripod.						By Matthew S. Smith								7 days ago							ReviewsRoku Streaming Stick Plus review: The sweet spot for upgradersThe $40 Roku Streaming Stick Plus delivers 4K HDR at a good price, but its software is increasingly complicated and bloated.						By Jared Newman								1 week ago							ReviewsLexar Play 2280 SE review: An attractive, fast SSD—but not on PS5The Lexar Play 2280 SE PCIe 4.0 HMB SSD is affordable and fast, but this QLC Costco-exclusive Special Edition isn't as special as its top-rated TLC Play 2280 cousin.
By Jon Jacobi								1 week ago							ReviewsSchlage Arrive Smart WiFi Deadbolt Lock review: Premium buildYou might see the Schlage Arrive Smart WiFi Deadbolt Lock's rubber buttons as a step back, but I appreciate the old-school tactile feedback they provide.						By James Barber								1 week ago							ReviewsAcer Aspire 16 AI review: Big screen, small priceThe Acer Aspire 16 AI delivers solid CPU performance, a big screen, and a long list of features at a low price.						By Matthew S. Smith								1 week ago							ReviewsI bought a stylish Pomera 'writer deck' and came away disappointedThe Pomera DM250 is a device laser-focused on writing, and only writing. I only wish it had a better keyboard and a finish that matched its $500 price tag.						By Michael Crider								2 weeks ago							ReviewsRoboForm review: A simple password manager with buried flawsThis password manager provides a seamless experience—so long as you let it call all the shots. But even then, it trails rivals in security.						By Alaina Yee								2 weeks ago							ReviewsTeamgroup T-Create C47 review: Mid-pack SSD but great with long writesTeamgroup's C47 PCIe 4.0 HMB SSD trailed the competition in benchmarks, but outshines many of its rivals during super-long writes						By Jon Jacobi								2 weeks ago							ReviewsAcer Chromebook Plus Spin 514 review: This 2-in-1 multitasks like a proThe Acer Chromebook Plus Spin 514 mixes a premium-feeling build with solid multitasking chops.						By Ashley Biancuzzo								2 weeks ago							ReviewsmyQ Doorbell Camera review: It’s a dead ringerThe inexpensive myQ Smart Garage Hub is a brilliant upgrade for garage door openers, but I won't be installing a myQ Doorbell Camera at my front door.						By Christopher Null								2 weeks ago							ReviewsSamsung 9100 PCIe 5.0 SSD review: Mighty once more! Once consistently top of the leader board, but recently an also-ran, Samsung storms back to the top with its latest NVMe SSD — the 9100 Pro.						By Jon Jacobi								2 weeks ago							ReviewsTeamgroup X2 Max review: This SSD flash drive is a mighty miteThe size of a small commodity thumb drive, the Teamgroup
X2 Max is actually a 10Gbps powerhouse.						By Jon Jacobi								2 weeks ago							ReviewsLenovo Yoga Pro 9i 16 Gen 10 review: Greatness at every turnIf you want a laptop that exudes greatness everywhere you look, the Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i 16 Gen 10 Aura Edition is it. From brilliant performance in its class and respectable battery life to a brilliant display and solid design, this machine makes the price tag seem reasonable.						By Mark Knapp								2 weeks ago							ReviewsEufy PoE Bullet Security Camera E40 review: Professional gradeWorried a savvy burglar will defeat your wireless security cams? I recommend the Eufy PoE Bullet Security Camera E40 and Network Video Recorder S4.						By Michael Ansaldo								3 weeks ago							1
