The Basilisk V3 is easily one of our favorite Razer gaming mice, and right now it’s on sale with an impressive 43 percent discount. Act fast to get the Basilisk V3 for $39.98 (was $69.99) on Amazon!
When we reviewed this Razer mouse, we called it a “full-function gaming mouse with lots of class,” giving it a stellar 4.5-star rating and our Editors’ Choice award. Apart from some very minor flaws, we loved it even at full price—and it’s a downright incredible value with this price drop.
In our review, we were particularly impressed by the 26K DPI optical sensor and the faultless performance it delivers, as well as by how easy it is to scroll using the HyperScroll Tilt Wheel. It’s also impossible to ignore the beautiful Chroma RGB lighting built into this mouse, something we know many gamers love. With 11 programmable buttons, you can set up custom actions to boost work productivity and gaming efficiency.
Note that this is a wired-only mouse, so if you absolutely can’t live without wireless, check out our picks for the best wireless mice. The other downside is that it’s on the bigger and bulkier side, so fans of tiny mice and claw grips may want to check out our roundups of the best budget gaming mice and best overall gaming mice instead.
Otherwise, the Razer Basilisk V3 remains one of the greatest wired gaming mice to deliver excellent performance at a budget-friendly price. Get it now for just $39.98 on Amazon!
