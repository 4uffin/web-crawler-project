It’s extremely easy to charge your devices when you have the right gear on hand, and this MagSafe charger from Apple will definitely make it easier for you. The best part is that you can get one of these for 30 percent off, a discount we haven’t seen since January and within pennies of its all-time low.
This Apple MagSafe charger has a 2m (6-foot) cable, so there’s plenty of leeway for you to move around when charging your phone, or to roll from side to side as you doomscroll before bed. It can provide charging of up to 25W, which means it’s absolutely perfect for the new iPhone 17 that’s surely coming your way soon. You’ll need to pair it with at least a 40W USB-C power adapter to get the fastest charging, but cheap options are easy to find.
It’s not every day that we see the Apple MagSafe Charger with a 2m cable down to $34.30, so grab one before the deal runs out over at Amazon.
