Few things are more impressive in a home PC setup than a monstrous monitor, and the Samsung Odyssey OLED G9 is up there as one of the most enormous ones you could have. If you’ve been holding off on one because of price concerns, now might be the chance you’ve been waiting for—because it’s now on sale for $420 off at B&H.
I repeat, this gigantic 49-inch beast of an OLED gaming display has been slashed down from its original $1,299.99 to just $879.99, making it way more affordable and much easier to justify. It’s close to the best price we’ve ever seen for this model, and boy is it a doozy.
Samsung’s G91SD isn’t just massive at 49 inches, but provides an ultrawide 5120×1440 screen that stretches out and gently wraps around your vision for maximum immersion while gaming and maximum eye comfort while working on spreadsheets, reading documents, and browsing the web. The 144Hz refresh rate is suitable for gamers too, assuming your machine is powerful enough to push such frame rates.
Not to mention the OLED panel, which produces vibrant colors and deep blacks that’ll truly elevate your streaming and gaming experiences. Connection options include HDMI 2.1, DisplayPort 1.4, and Micro HDMI 2.1, plus three high-speed USB-C ports and a 3.5mm audio jack. Other niceties include Nvidia G-Sync and AMD FreeSync Premium Pro support, height and tilt adjustments, and VESA mounting.
Level up your gaming battlestation with the 49-inch Samsung Odyssey OLED G9 for $879.99 while you still can! B&H has this deal marked as time-limited with a deadline of midnight EDT on Sunday, September 21st. If it’s still too pricey, check out our picks for the best gaming monitors.
