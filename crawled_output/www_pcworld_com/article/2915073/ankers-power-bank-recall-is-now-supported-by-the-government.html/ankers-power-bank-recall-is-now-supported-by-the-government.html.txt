Anker’s power bank recall is now backed by the government
Send the affected Anker power banks back, as there's a risk of fire and explosion.

Nearly half a million Anker power banks are being recalled by the company, after an investigation by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) found over thirty reports of fire and explosion incidents associated with the devices.
The recall involves Anker Power Banks with model numbers A1647, A1652, A1257, A1681, and A1689, a number which can be found in the model listing but is also engraved on the back or side of the power bank. About 481,000 of these power banks that were previously sold are affected.
“Consumers should immediately stop using the recalled power banks and visit Anker’s Recall Page to verify the product serial number and register for the recall,” the CPSC wrote in an advisory. Anker also publishes a separate product recalls page as well.
The recall includes some of the power banks that Anker itself voluntarily recalled back in June, though that recall also included the Model A1263 Power Bank, one that the CPSC recall does not name. Anker also recalled the A1642, A1647, and A1652 power banks in Sept. 2024.
The CPSC advises against simply throwing the affected battery packs away. “Recalled lithium-ion batteries must be disposed of differently than other batteries, because they present a greater risk of fire,” the agency said.
Amazon appears to have pulled the affected power banks from its shopping pages, although the CPSC also said that the power banks had been sold at AliExpress, eBay, Walmart, and via TikTok from August 2023 to June 2025. They cost about $30 to $50 per power bank. What should you buy instead? Consult our list of the best power banks for some ideas.
With more than three months remaining in 2025, the CPSC said that it had issued 376 recalls and safety warnings, a record. The Trump administration has sought to replace several commissioners on the panel, claiming they violated the non-partisan nature of the agency.
