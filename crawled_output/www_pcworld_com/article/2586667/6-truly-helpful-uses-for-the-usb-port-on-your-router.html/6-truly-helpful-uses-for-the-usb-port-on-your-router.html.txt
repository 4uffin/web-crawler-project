The USB port on your router is often unused and yet it offers practical functions that can make everyday life easier. You can do things like saving and sharing files, mobile charging, or even an automatic backup of your data. We’ll tell you exactly how this works and what else you can do with your router’s USB port below.

What can the USB port on the router do?
The USB port on the router offers various functions depending on your model. Here are some of the most useful applications:
Printer sharing: Connect a USB printer to the router to make it available as a network printer for all devices on the network. This saves you having to change cables or drivers back and forth.
Network-attached storage (NAS): Connect an external hard drive or USB stick to store files centrally. You can make documents, photos or videos accessible to all devices in the home network and, with some models, even stream content such as films and music directly.
Backups: Many routers support automatic backups. Files from the network are automatically backed up to a connected USB storage device, either time controlled or in real time as soon as new files are created. You can find instructions for this further down in this article.
Power supply for IoT devices: Some USB ports are suitable for powering small devices such as IoT hubs, smart LED lamps, or chargers. A practical solution if there is no free socket nearby.
Mobile internet: If your router supports LTE dongles, you can easily switch to a mobile data connection in the event of an internet outage. This is particularly useful if you need a stable connection and your landline connection fails.
Charge devices: Some router models allow you to charge smartphones, tablets, or other devices via the USB port.

Which devices can you connect?
The type of supported devices also depends on the router model. Check the operating instructions to see which devices your router supports and which connections are compatible.
How to use the USB port for automatic backups:
Connect a USB hard drive or stick to the router. In most cases, the storage device will be recognized automatically.
Log in via the router’s user interface and search for options such as “Backup” or “Storage.”
Select the option “New Backup Job” or a similar function and follow the instructions of the wizard.
Decide whether you want a scheduled backup or a real-time backup that saves changes immediately.
Perform the first backup manually to ensure that everything is set up correctly.
