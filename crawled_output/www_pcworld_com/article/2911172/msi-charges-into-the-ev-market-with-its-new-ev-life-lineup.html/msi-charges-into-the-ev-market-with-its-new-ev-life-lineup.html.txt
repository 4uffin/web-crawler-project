MSI is more than just PCs. The company is branching out into the world of electric-vehicle (EV) chargers, launching the Level 2 “EV Life Plus” home charger with support for both the Type 1 (SAE J1772) and NACS connectors.
If you’re a tech enthusiast, you know that “PC” companies like Acer, Asus, and others have expanded into graphics cards, peripherals, and more over the last few years, all in a bid to diversify and grow the business. MSI’s push into the home electric-vehicle charger market, however, seems to be a first.
MSI is announcing four “EV Life” chargers and four “EV Life Plus” chargers, ranging in price from between $449.99 and $599.99. Essentially, each of the four chargers in each EV Life or EV Life Plus category are subdivided by their available plug connector — the Type 1 SAE J1772 connector, the default standard for most level-2 EV chargers; and the NACS standard, which Tesla cars use and is being integrated into new EVs like the 2026 Nissan Leaf for fast charging.
MSI also provides hardwired options that can be installed into a garage, or standalone devices that can be plugged in. All of the new EV Life and Life Plus chargers include a 24.6-foot cable for charging,
MSI said.

The difference between the EV Life ($449.99 to $499.99) and EV Life Plus ($549.99 to $599.99) is the connectivity aspects, according to a company representative. The basic EV Life chargers use Bluetooth and your phone for charge management and to transfer information about the charging process. The EV Life Plus lineup uses either Wi-Fi or Ethernet for this information.
A home charger can either use Level 1 “trickle charging,” essentially using the 110-volt three-prong outlets that you’ll find in your home or garage. They usually deliver a few miles of battery power every hour. Electric dryers can use 220V to 240V, and Level 2 chargers connected to these NEMA 14-50 outlets deliver enough power to add 40 miles or more of battery range per hour. In the case of MSI’s EV Life and Life Plus chargers, they accept up to 240 volts and transfer up to 14.4kW at 60 amps, enough for 43 to 59 miles of charging power, according to MSI.
Though the chargers are ruggedized to ensure IP55 and IP67 water and dust resistance. They’re rated from -40 degrees F to 131 degrees F,

MSI says its chargers are UL- and Energy Star-compliant, and include a five-year warranty.
Clarification: MSI’s chargers are rated to withstand water and dust resistance to IP55 and IP67 standards. The chargers are also rated to withstand temperatures of -40 degrees F.
