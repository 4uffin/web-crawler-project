We love massive monitors and OLED panels as much as the next enthusiast, but there’s no denying that massive OLED displays are pretty darn expensive. That’s why if you’re in the market for one and you spot a big sale, you should jump on it—like this 49-inch Innocn ultrawide 1440p monitor that’s now $795 (was $1,000) on Amazon.
This ultrawide monitor is absolutely massive at 49 inches, with a gorgeous 5120×1440 resolution (that’s basically two regular 1440p monitors side by side without an annoying bezel down the middle) and a lovely OLED panel for vibrant colors, deep blacks, and glorious visuals.
It’s adequate for modest gaming with its 144Hz refresh rate and 0.03ms response time, so you can easily switch from spreadsheets and documents to 3D gaming in a snap. Plus, the gentle 1800R curve wraps around your vision to reduce eye fatigue and improve immersion.
As for connectivity, you’re looking at dual HDMI ports, a DisplayPort, and a USB-C video port with 90W of power delivery (so it works great with your laptop and won’t drain it dead). On top of that, there are two USB-A ports for peripherals and an Ethernet port.
Snag this 49-inch Innocn ultrawide 1440p OLED monitor for $795 while you still can. Note that this is a Prime-exclusive sale, so if you aren’t a Prime member yet, sign up for a 30-day free trial and get this discount.
