Mark Zuckerberg recently unveiled the Meta Ray-Ban Display and Neural Band, which are smart glasses with a color high-resolution display and wristband controls. It sounds like science fiction, but it’s more of an inconspicuous integration of tech into everyday life.
Ray-Ban Display and Neural Band
The glasses look like classic Ray-Bans, but they have a discreet display on the side of the right lens. It supposedly doesn’t get in the way when looking through the glasses and only appears when needed to display messages, photos, translations, or AI responses.
Meta / Ray-Ban
The smart display’s resolution is 600×600 pixels with a 20-degree field of view and 42 pixels per degree—sharp enough for everyday use by everyday people. The display’s brightness adjusts from 30 to 5,000 nits and the refresh rate goes up to 90Hz, according to Meta.
A new feature here is control via the supplied Meta Neural Band. This wrist-worn device recognizes muscle movements on the wrist and converts them into commands—a swipe of the thumb is enough.
Meta / Ray-Ban
Based on four years of research with 200,000 participants, the AI glasses should be intuitive to control. The glasses themselves have a battery life of up to 6 hours, and up to 30 hours with a charging case. The Vectran material is as strong as steel but flexible, and Meta also claims that the AI-powered glasses are waterproof with an IPX7 rating.
Other features include WhatsApp and Messenger integration, video calls, navigation, live subtitles, and music control. The 12MP camera films in 1440p at 30 FPS, while the internal 32GB storage can store up to 500 photos or 100 30-second videos.
Two open-ear speakers and five microphones ensure good audio and recordings. The AI glasses are compatible with iOS 15.2 and Android 10, and corrective lenses from -4 to 4 diopters are also possible. Meta offers the Ray-Ban Display in black and sand colors and with transition lenses, in two sizes: Standard and Large (144mm to 150mm width).
Pricing and availability
The price of the Meta Ray-Ban Display at launch will be $799 including the Neural Band, and the AI glasses will initially only be available to buy in the US starting September 30th, 2025. Europe is to follow in early 2026.
Meta sees these smart glasses as an intermediate step between camera glasses and holographic AR models—technology that you wear inconspicuously in day-to-day life instead of constantly staring at your smartphone. It remains to be seen whether Meta’s AI glasses will catch on, but neuro-control is an exciting development.
