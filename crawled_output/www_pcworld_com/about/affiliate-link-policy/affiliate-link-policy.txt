Editorial Independence
PCWorld earns revenue through a mixture of responsible advertising (we do not accept gambling or pornographic ads), clearly marked up sponsored content, and affiliate links.
Affiliate links are those that you may click on within our content that take you to an online retailer or manufacturer to learn more about its products. Should you purchase goods from the vendor, we may be paid a small commission.
As an Amazon Associate and a partner with Awin, CJ, Impact, Rakuten, Tradedoubler, Webgains and other affiliate services, we earn on qualifying purchases.
This does not affect our editorial independence, or how we review the products and services we recommend.
Affiliate links are generated automatically by the site, and do not apply to all the products we cover. Our journalists are generally unaware of how much commission – if any – PCWorld receives from a purchase.
Most of the products we review come straight from the manufacturer as editorial review samples. We agree to no preconditions for reviews, and do not let manufacturers read reviews before publication. We consider all samples to be on loan, and return them to the manufacturer upon request. Editorial policy forbids selling unreturned samples.
Any recommendation (or criticism) is based on our experts believing that the product is the best (or not the best) in its class.
PCWorld helps you navigate the PC ecosystem to find the products you want and the advice you need to get the job done.
