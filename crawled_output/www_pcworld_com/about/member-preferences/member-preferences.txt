Foundry. takes the protection of your personal data very seriously. Protecting your privacy is paramount to us. Compliance with legal provisions — such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), CAN-SPAM Act, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and others is a matter of course for us. On this page we want to briefly explain how you can be an active participant in the management of your data and personal preferences. For additional information, please reference Foundry privacy policy and cookie policy and Your California Privacy Rights.
On this page you’ll be able to:

Unsubscribe from everything
If you’d like to discontinue receiving all newsletter and promotions (email, telemarketing, SMS/text) from ALL Foundry brands, please submit your request in writing to: websites@foundryco.com (or the mailing address below).
Browser push notifications
If you have opted in to the service, our editorial team is able to send browser push notifications to your device. These notifications alert you to the most interesting stories of the day.
Though we do our best not to spam readers with these notifications, we are aware that with other sites also using push notifications they might become overwhelming. Here’s how to opt in to or out of push notifications.
How to opt in to push notifications: Within a few seconds of your first visit to our website you will see a pop-up at the top of the page advising that ‘www.pcworld.com wants to show notifications’, with buttons to allow you to either Block or Allow push notifications. To opt in, click Allow.
If you do not see this pop-up, you may have interacted with it on a previous visit, you may be blocking pop-ups, or you may be blocking notifications from our website. Look in the address bar of your browser for a notification icon; click this and you should see a notification advising you that notifications are blocked for this site. Select ‘Allow for this site’.
How to opt out of push notifications: Once you have opted in to push notifications, turning them off requires you to adjust your notification settings on the device on which you are receiving them (this is not something we can do for you as we do not have physical access to your device).
All browsers have slightly different but very similar processes to achieve this. In the desktop version of Google Chrome, for example, tap on the three dots icon at the top of the browser window and choose Settings. Now go to Privacy and Security > Site Settings, and under Permissions select Notifications. Here you will see a list of sites for which you have actively set notification preferences. Scroll down to the ‘Allowed to send notifications’ list, find PCWorld, tap the three dots next to it and choose either Block or Remove.
On the mobile version of Google Chrome, you should also tap on the three dots icon to access the Settings menu. Scroll down to and select Notifications > In-app notification settings. Again, you will see a ‘Blocked’ list and an ‘Allowed’ list, which you can edit as required.
Consent Audit Log
You are able to request your Foundry consent audit log. If you’d like to request your consent audit log, please submit a request in writing to: DataRequest@foundryco.com (or the mailing address below).
Right to Disclosure
For California consumers, under CCPA, you are able to request that Foundry disclose the categories and specific pieces of information that it has collected. If you’d like to request such disclosure, please submit a request in writing to: DataRequest@foundryco.com (or the mailing address below) and please put CCPA Request in the subject line.
Right to be Forgotten and Right to Deletion
For European Union residents under the jurisdiction of GDPR, you are able to request that Foundry remove all personal data from our systems. If you’d like to request to be forgotten, please submit a request in writing to: preferences@foundryco.com (or the mailing address below).
Similarly, for California consumers, under the CCPA, you are able to request that Foundry delete any personal data that it has collected, by submitting a request in writing to: preferences@foundryco.com (or the mailing address below) and please put CCPA in the subject line.
Right to Opt Out of the Sale of Personal Data
