Today’s Stock Market
Michael P. Reinking, CFA & Eric CriscuoloSeptember 17, 2025 at 6:00 p.m. ESTThis was one of the most interesting setups for an FOMC meeting, if only for the personnel drama. Stephen Miran just finished his Welcome video and first HR meeting, joining as the newest Board of Governors member. Lisa Cook is about to have the Supreme Court weigh in on her potential firing. Meanwhile a few members of the Committee are jockeying to replace Chair Powell next year, all while the White House is calling him names. As widely expected, the Federal Reserve cut rates by 25bps. The language in the statement also evolved as expected. There was a slight downgrade of economic activity and an acknowledgment of the slowdown in job growth. As Chair Powell did at Jackson Hole, the Committee elevated this side of the mandate by adding “downside risks to employment have risen”. The forward guidance evolved in a more dovish way suggesting additional cuts are on the horizon. Within the SEP there were tweaks to the economic forecasts with modest increases to GDP in both 2025 and 2026. Not surprisingly, the DOT plot provided the most intriguing analysis. However, as predicted it wasn’t hard to identify Miran. There was another outlier, presumably not a voter otherwise they would have dissented today, that saw rates at 4.5% at year-end. Otherwise, 6 officials projected no additional cuts this year, 2 expected one, and the rest of the Committee is angling for two. That caused the median DOT to signal two additional cuts this year, in line with expectations. However, there was a wider and more disperse range of views for 2026. Despite some volatility, equity markets ended pretty much where they were heading into the meeting. After the initial move lower Treasury yields also moved higher ending up 4-7bps across the curve. Small caps gave up some of the earlier outperformance as did some of the housing related stocks while financials benefitted from the expectation of a measured rate cutting cycle.
