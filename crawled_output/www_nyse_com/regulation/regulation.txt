(equities and options), NYSE American LLC (equities and options), NYSE National, Inc. (equities), and NYSE Texas, Inc. (equities) (collectively, the “NYSE Exchanges”) – and for addressing non-compliance with the NYSE Exchanges’ rules and federal securities laws. NYSER enforces both the NYSE Exchanges’ and their members' compliance with NYSE Exchange rules and applicable federal securities requirements. It also monitors and enforces listed companies’ compliance with applicable listing standards of the NYSE Exchanges. By performing these duties, NYSER supports the NYSE Exchanges’ efforts to promote just and equitable principles of trade, encourage free and open markets, and protect investors and the public interest. Many of these regulatory functions are performed directly by NYSER; others are performed by FINRA or other self-regulatory organizations pursuant to a regulatory services agreement, national market system plans, or other arrangements.ResourcesRulesFilings, amendments, SEC releases, extensions, and withdrawalsRule FilingsFilings, amendments, SEC releases, extensions, and withdrawalsRule InterpretationsInterpretations, info memos, weekly and education bulletins, and rule changesRegulation SHOGuidance and list of threshold securities for every settlement dayNew Derivatives Securities ProductsA list of derivative securities products approved for listing and tradingNoncompliant IssuersIssuers noncompliant with standards of delaying filing annual or interim reportsDelistingsIssuers pending delisting form the ExchangeDisciplinary ActionsList of NYSE Group exchange disciplinary actionsProxy RulingsList of discretionary/nondiscretionary vote determinationsFormsOur MarketsNYSECurrently Listed Companies Issuers Seeking to List Rules and Disciplinary Actions NYSE Arca EquitiesCurrently Listed Companies Issuers Seeking to List Rules and Disciplinary Actions NYSE AmericanCurrently Listed Companies Issuers Seeking to List Rules and Disciplinary Actions NYSE Arca OptionsRules and Disciplinary Actions NYSECurrently Listed Companies Issuers Seeking to List Rules and Disciplinary Actions NYSE Arca EquitiesCurrently Listed Companies Issuers Seeking to List Rules and Disciplinary Actions NYSE AmericanCurrently Listed Companies Issuers Seeking to List Rules and Disciplinary Actions NYSE Arca OptionsRules and Disciplinary Actions NYSE American OptionsRules and Disciplinary Actions NYSE National Rules _____________________________________NYSE Texas Rules __________________________________Complaints & InquiriesNYSE Regulation ("NYSER") welcomes information from investors and others who believe that a member firm or individual broker may have violated securities rules and regulations.
