Each offers a unique path for listing based on your company’s unique needs:Initial Public Offering (IPO)An IPO is the most common way that companies choose to join the public markets in order to raise capital and establish a currency for investing in innovation, growth, acquisitions and employees. The U.S. equity market is consistently chosen given its concentration of capital and to tap the visibility offered to investors and customers.Direct Floor ListingThis type of listing allows a foreign company that already has a listing in its home market to become a public company in the U.S., without raising capital at the time of listing. Typically, the company lists in conjunction with the filing of a Form 20-F annual report. A quotation listing provides liquidity for U.S. investors holding the stock before the listing; the ability to provide equity compensation to U.S. employees; currency for U.S. acquisitions; and the ability to raise capital in the U.S. public markets.Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC)A SPAC is a company formed for the purpose of raising proceeds through an IPO and using those funds to acquire an operating business. Experienced management teams (e.g., industry veterans or private equity experts) find an attractive acquisition target and use the proceeds to complete the acquisition, which results in the SPAC transforming itself into a listed operating company.Additional Ways to ListIf you are a listed company and looking to join the NYSE, or an earlier stage start-up looking to access public capital, here are some additional paths:TransferCompanies that are already listed on a U.S. exchange may transfer their listing to the NYSE.
