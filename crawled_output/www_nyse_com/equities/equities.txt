Offering price improvement for retail orders within an exchange environment offers individual investors new economic incentives and provides greater transparency, liquidity and competition in the U.S. cash equities marketplace. The NYSE National program offers midpoint price improvement. The programs can be utilized by retail firms directly as well as by the brokers that service retail order flow providers.NYSE Arca Market MakerThe all-electronic NYSE Arca relies on a system of competing Market Makers to provide a fast, efficient and consistent marketplace for all participants, including liquidity providers. Market Makers are required to maintain adequate minimum capital and continuous, two-sided identified and displayed quotes for all registered securities during Core Trading Hours (9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. ET).Learn moreMarket InsightsThe NYSE Research team explores market trends, analyzes exchange products and trading situations, and offers data-driven perspectives that promote greater understanding of our markets. For example, we recently analyzed how increased retail activity in the equities market has affected various aspects of trading, in particular the period immediately after the opening auction. Market participants often avoid this time of day due to higher volatility, an approach worth re-evaluating given current trends.View nowOur ExchangesThe New York Stock Exchange operates five equities exchanges, each purpose-built to meet the needs of corporate and ETF issuers and offer greater choice to investors in how they trade.NYSEWith the most consistent auction performance, the most displayed shares at the NBBO, and the narrowest quoted bid / ask spreads, NYSE is the global leader in market quality.
