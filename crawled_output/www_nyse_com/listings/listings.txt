Our community of NYSE-listed global business icons and innovators in every industry includes 74% of the publicly listed Fortune 500 and 70% of the S&P 500 (as of 5/12/2025). We support our community with best-in-class services, public company advocacy, better trading, and an expansive media network.Contact us about joining the world's largest exchange.Contact Us2024 was another history-making year for the NYSE, when we hosted seven of the ten largest IPOs in the U.S. Globally, NYSE Group ranked #1 in total proceeds, with over $109 billion raised across IPOs and follow-on offerings. 11 Wall Street remains the epicenter where capital meets culture, convening leading CEOs and icons from the Rock to Ronaldinho.The NYSE AdvantageNYSE’s community and the resources and services we provide them are unparalleled. And as the world’s largest primary listings exchange, we have invested heavily in our industry-leading technology, Pillar, which underpins much of today’s highly sophisticated electronic marketplace. While Pillar leans heavily on speed and automation, our trading model pairs cutting-edge technology with human discretion for the most important liquidity events each trading day, the opening and closing auctions. This unique approach leads to larger, more flexible auctions with the broadest possible participation, contributing to lower volatility and tighter spreads around these key events. When our issuers need us most – on IPO day, a major index rebalance, or when unexpected volatility surfaces – we are there to deliver in ways that technology alone could not.

They brought that mission to Wall Street for their public debut, transforming the NYSE into a playground for Reddit employees to celebrate their listing day, with Snoo hunts and ‘easter eggs’ throughout the building, and a mini golf course that traced Reddit’s history and celebrated some of its favorite subreddits.At the center of everything they do is the Reddit community. In a twist on how most companies choose to open the markets on their Listing Day, it was Snoo, and not the executive team, who rang the Opening Bell. The possibilities do not end there. NYSE is part of Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE: ICE), which separately agreed with Reddit to leverage their data API to develop new products for the financial industry.Watch now Recently ListedStandards are higher here. 70% of US IPOs in 2024 did not qualify to list on the NYSE.
