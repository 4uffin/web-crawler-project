They are critical to the orderly functioning of the marketplace, assuring that no trades take place before the opening or after the close.Bell CalendarRecent Bell VideosThe History of the Bell First Uses of the Bell
Bells were first used at the Exchange in the 1870s with the advent of
continuous trading. A Chinese gong was the original bell of choice. But in
1903, when the Exchange moved to its current building, the gong was replaced
by a brass bell -- electrically operated and large enough in size to resonate
throughout the voluminous main trading floor. Today, each of the four trading
areas of the NYSE has its own bell, operated synchronously from a single
control panel.
The brass bells functioned without incident until the late 1980s, when the
NYSE decided the time had come to refurbish them and purchase a new one for
backup. With that decision, the Exchange learned just how unusual its bells
really are.
First, the Exchange had to identify the manufacturer of the bells -- a firm
with which the NYSE hadn’t done business in more than 80 years. With some
digging, the G. S. Edwards Company of Norwalk, Connecticut, was rediscovered.
However, when the NYSE officials explained that they wanted to purchase a new
bell, measuring 18 inches in diameter and matching the old, representatives of
the Edwards Company were astonished. It seems that neither Edwards nor any
other company, makes bells anywhere near that large -- or loud -- today.
Edwards agreed to make a new bell from scratch, bringing former employees out
of retirement to handle the job. Sound measurements were taken, and the tone
of the bell was matched to the NYSE’s existing bells.
A Hidden Discovery
Along the way, too, came the discovery of a massive old bell hidden within the
infrastructure of the NYSE. An electrical contractor, on hearing of the plans
to upgrade the bell system, recalled how he had once seen a bell in the crawl
space above the ceiling of the main trading room. The long-forgotten beauty --
a whopping 27 inches in diameter and covered with a thick coat of dust -- was
removed and reconditioned. It turned out to be another 1903 original and is
believed to have been buried in its resting place for half a century because
it was simply too loud even for the Exchange. Toned down, it now gleams on a
platform above the trading floor, patiently awaiting its recall to duty if the
need ever arises.
When the NYSE moved into its new building at 10-12 Broad Street in 1865,
“calls” of stock were made twice a day in the second floor Board Room. The
president kept order during trading sessions with the aid of a gavel.
The gavel has always been used in conjunction with the closing bell, perhaps
in recognition of the 19th century stock calls. The gavel strikes a "sounding
block," a turned block of wood, possibly oak, from the center part of a log
(you can see tree rings on the bottom side). This sounding block, or one of a
similar size and shape, appears in the 1928 motion picture film, "The Nation's
Marketplace."
Some additional bell facts:
The first guest to ring the opening bell was Leonard Ross, in 1956 . The
10-year-old had won a television quiz show answering questions about the
stock market.
An expert analyzed the sound of the bell for the NYSE’s trademark
registration as follows: "The mark consists of the sound of a brass bell
tuned to the pitch D, but with an overtone of D-sharp, struck nine times at
a brisk tempo, with the final tone allowed to ring until the sound decays
naturally. The rhythmic pattern is eight 16th notes and a quarter note; the
total duration, from the striking of the first tone to the end of the decay
on the final one, is just over 3 seconds."
