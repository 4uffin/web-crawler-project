The auction is a unique blend of sophisticated technology and human judgment that produces the day's most important price point for investors and listed companies. The smooth functioning of auctions is critical as market participants expect and rely on the close to provide a critical daily price point that reflects market interest.Given the auction's importance, the NYSE places intense focus on its technology and process, and strives to ensure that all participants understand the tools available to facilitate trading in this critical event.Here's a behind-the-scenes look at what happen during the NYSE Closing Auction.Key PointsGiven the auction’s importance, the NYSE places intense focus on its technology and process to facilitate trading in this critical eventNYSE is the only exchange with an open-outcry trading floor, able to offer investors access to auctions via a Floor BrokerThe NYSE closing auction grew to nearly 7% of NYSE-listed volume, roughly twice the share that auction commanded just five years agoAuction ParticipantsInvestors seeking to participate in the closing auction can participate in the same way they participate in trading throughout the day, by sending orders to their broker to act on their behalf to execute their orders. Investors can also direct their orders to a NYSE Floor Broker for execution in the close, just as they can at any point throughout the trading day. Floor Brokers can receive orders from their customers via voice or electronic communication, and enter their order via handheld device or using algorithms.See our related post on D Orders for data and analysis of Closing D Order usageDesignated Market Makers (DMMs) have obligations to maintain fair and orderly markets and facilitate price discovery throughout the trading day, obligations that extend to the auctions. One of their obligations is to facilitate the closing auction process, which includes setting the closing price at a level that satisfies all interest that is willing to participate at a price better than the closing auction price, and supplying liquidity as needed to offset any remaining auction imbalances that exist at the closing bell.Order TypesThere are several NYSE order types that can be used in the closing auction, with the most common being Market-On-Close (MOC) and Limit-On-Close (LOC) orders.An MOC order is an unpriced order to buy or sell a security at the closing price and is guaranteed to receive an execution in the NYSE closing auction. An LOC order sets the maximum price an investor is willing to pay, or the minimum price for which an investor is willing to sell, in the closing auction. An LOC order priced better than the final closing auction price is guaranteed to receive an execution in the NYSE closing auction.Because the NYSE is the only exchange with an open-outcry Trading Floor, it is also able to offer investors access to auctions via a Floor Broker. Floor Brokers are able to enter a customer's order orally to a DMM on the NYSE Trading Floor or via an electronic order, called a Closing D Order, which again is sent from the NYSE Trading Floor. Closing D Order are designed to replicate the Floor Broker's traditional face-to-face interaction, participating passively most of the day but also trading at more aggressive prices when contra-side liquidity is available.The various order types described above are designed to allow maximum flexibility for investors choosing to participate in the auction. The different order types align with different events leading up to the auction.Closing Auction Timeline6:30 AMMOC/LOC orders can be entered2:00 PMImbalance information is published to Floor Brokers3:50 PMCutoff for MOC and LOC modification and cancellationImbalance dissemination begins including Closing D Orders at their discretionary price rangeMOC/LOC order entry allowed only on side opposite to the side of the Significant Imbalance if one was published3:59:50 PMCutoff for Closing D Order entry, modification and cancellation4:00 PMRegular way trading ends and auction commencesAuction TransparencyBeginning at 3:50 p.m., NYSE publicly disseminates closing auction order imbalance information.

This is roughly twice the share that auction commanded just five years ago. This is the case because investors and brokers acting on their behalf can see the benefit of participating at a time when the maximum amount of buyers and sellers are coming together.ResourcesArticle Why NYSE's Closing Auction is crucial for modern marketsTwenty years ago, trading shares in a company was a simple business.
