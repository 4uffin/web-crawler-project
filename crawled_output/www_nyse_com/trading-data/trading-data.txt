In this article, "When Volatility Calls, NYSE DMMs Answer", the NYSE Research team takes a deeper dive into NYSE listed-company performance when volatility is high, with a special focus on the Designated Market Maker (DMM).NYSE Closing AuctionThe New York Stock Exchange closing auction is the single largest liquidity event of the day – trading $18.9 billion per day, on average, and is the primary liquidity event for institutional and retail investors. Significant liquidity and anonymity at the close help to minimize the market impact costs of large trades. On average, comparing the closing price to the Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) of the last two minutes, S&P 500 stocks have a price change of less than 0.053% with an average auction size of $37 million per security.At the NYSE, the community of floor brokers and Designated Market Makers (DMMs) contribute over 35% of close liquidity, on average and between 3:50pm and 4:00pm, auction information is disseminated every second, providing transparency for market participants.We have previously studied Closing Auction liquidity, participation and price dislocation, and now focus on the price impact of auction order submission.Learn moreNYSE MarketsNYSE markets are home to a diverse group of listed companies from around the world.
