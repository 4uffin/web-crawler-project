HD 8: $64.99 at Amazon (regularly $99.99)HD 10: $89.99 at amazon (regularly $139.99)Read on for more promising reviews of the Amazon Kindle Fire HD 8 tablet and nab an HD 8 or HD 10 while they’re on sale today. “I love my Fire HD8. Easy to set up, automatically. It’s a dream to operate. Simple, intuitive and colorful, it’s really fun. So many apps with everything I need at my fingertips. I listen to an audiobook while I do routine tasks on the tablet. Set up kids’ time & options at the start so they’re safe watching.I love how portable it is ― convenient to take with me. A perfect size to fit into my purse. Like having my pc with me but without the size & weight. I don’t use my iPhone for email bc I don’t want to be looking at it constantly. But I can take the tablet out & send an email or order online without waiting until I get home to my pc. I don’t like texting on my cell bc it’s so tiny but using the tablet gives great visibility.I already sent my sister one of these bc she struggles with her pc & using this tablet is a breeze! It make such a pleasant difference bc she doesn’t really need a computer. She wants the connectivity of internet interactions like email, Zoom, streaming movies & videos. I’ve had more expensive tablets that have not lasted. A great tablet for the price!” —
