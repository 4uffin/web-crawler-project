It's perfect not only for sports events, but going to Disney or just running errands. I will say the shorts under are not long, so if you have thick thighs, it might be an issue. Other than that, do not hesitate to buy! The material is also soooo soft." — AshPrice: $303TargetA midi cotton-blend A-line dress with a corset-style bodicePromising review: "The dress could easily sell at Anthropologie!

Bought it for my daughter, along with a cardigan to wear in the winter as well. It fits nicely and doesn’t look cheap at all. The skirt area goes just above the knee for her and is not too short. It is also very comfortable. It will look great during any season, as you can layer it or not. So many ways to dress it up or down. Recommend!" — Moz59Price: $1815Target, TargetA 100% cotton sweater maxi dress from the Future Collective linePromising review: "I'm obsessed with this dress!

I stumbled across it at a Target I don’t typically go to, and even my 5-year-old said, 'Mommy, you have to get it, ' when I tried it on, and he made me take a picture with him. It is extremely comfortable and just a dream. Every time I wear it, I get compliments and people ask where I got it. Favorite dress of the season by far. I’ve been waiting for this to go online so I could buy it in every color. I wish there were more options!" — fayemarie1993 Price: $3518TargetA ribbed tube dressPromising review: "Great dress!

22TargetA mini sleeveless sweater dressPromising review: "This dress is adorable! It's sweater material but not too heavy, so you can definitely wear it in early fall with open-toe shoes or sneakers and transition into cooler weather with boots and a jacket layered over it. The price is great for the quality of this dress. It runs true to size; it fits great/not tight, and hits just above my knee. I purchased the brown. Grab it while you can!" — MHPrice: $3023TargetA Western-style button-down shirtdressPromising review: "Love it! Wasn't sure when I ordered this heavy denim shirt dress by Universal Thread, but have been living in it since it arrived (& ordered more). Per size reviews, I ordered both my regular size and one size down. Turns out both work great! One size down fits just right to wear as a dress or tunic. My usual size is comfy-roomy, so I wear it as a jacket/coat/housecoat/etc. Happy, happy!" — BGPrice: $1924TargetA button-front A-line knit midi dressPromising review: "First of all, I never write reviews.
