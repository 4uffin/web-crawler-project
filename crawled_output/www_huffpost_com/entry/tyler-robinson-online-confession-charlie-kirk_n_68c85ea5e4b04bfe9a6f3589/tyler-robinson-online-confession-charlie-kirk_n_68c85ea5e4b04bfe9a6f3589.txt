“Hey guys, I have bad news for you all,” the message reads. “It was me at UVU yesterday. im sorry for all of this.”The report aligns with earlier statements from investigators about Robinson’s communications on Discord.In other, earlier, Discord messages sent shortly after the FBI released surveillance photos of the suspect, Robinson joked that his “doppelganger” was trying to “get me in trouble.”Advertisement
According to The New York Times, which reviewed the missives, a friend in the group chat of around 20 people jokingly responded, “Tyler killed Charlie!!!!” Shortly after Robinson’s arrest, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox (R) told reporters a roommate of Robinson’s had also shared his Discord messages with authorities.Among other things, someone named “Tyler” reportedly told his roommates about “a need to retrieve a rifle from a drop point, leaving the rifle in a bush, messages related to visually watching the area where a rifle was left, and a message referring to having left the rifle wrapped in a towel,” said Cox.Advertisement
The weapon believed to have been used in the killing, a Mauser model 30-.06 caliber bolt-action rifle, was found wrapped in a dark towel in a wooded area nearby.Relatedcharlie kirkdiscordTyler James RobinsonThey Witnessed Charlie Kirk’s Assassination.
