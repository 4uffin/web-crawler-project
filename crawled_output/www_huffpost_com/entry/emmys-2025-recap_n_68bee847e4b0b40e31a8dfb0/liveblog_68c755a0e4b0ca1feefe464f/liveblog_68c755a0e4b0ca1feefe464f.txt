Stay tuned for updates.3 hrs 33 mins agoNjera PerkinsKevin Mazur via Getty ImagesNoah Wyle’s Emmys Tux Is A Subtle Nod To His Nominated Medical DramaNoah Wyle showed up to this year’s Emmys ready to celebrate “The Pitt,” whether it scores more awards tonight or not. On the red carpet, the actor revealed to “Entertainment Tonight” that his black tuxedo is made by the same company that makes the scrubs for his HBO Max medical drama. The same scrubs that are “on the backs of many health care workers across our country and around the world,” Wyle added.“We were in New York at the Gotham Awards, and I was wearing a tuxedo, and someone asked if it was as comfortable as the scrubs I wear at work,” Wyle explained. “And so I looked into the camera and I made a challenge to Figs, ‘Hey, Figs, can you make me a tuxedo that’s as comfortable as the scrubs I wear?’ And they went and did it.”Wyle could very well accept his first Emmy tonight wearing that tux, and it’d be the perfect full-circle moment because it marks his first nomination since he scrubbed in over two decades ago as Dr. John Carter on “ER.” He’s up for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series, and “The Pitt” is nominated for Best Drama. Now, we’ll have to see if they take their awards home. See All UpdatesAdvertisementAdvertisement
