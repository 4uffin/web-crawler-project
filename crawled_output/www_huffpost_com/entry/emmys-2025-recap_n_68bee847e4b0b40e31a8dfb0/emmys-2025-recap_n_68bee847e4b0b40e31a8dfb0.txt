The Television Academy is honoring the best of television in its annual ceremony, with comedian Nate Bargatze as a first-time host for the show.“Severance” and “The Studio” are leading contenders for the ceremony.

Stay tuned for updates.Just nowNjera PerkinsKevin Winter via Getty Images‘Last Week Tonight With John Oliver’ Wins Outstanding Writing For A Variety SeriesFor the eighth year in a row, “Last Week Tonight With John Oliver” won for Outstanding Writing For a Variety Series. Daniel O'Brien, senior writer on the show, celebrated the win and fellow nominees onstage, saying how honored he is to share the category with “all writers of late-night political comedy while that is still a type of show that’s allowed to exist.”The subtle dig comes after the cancellation of CBS’ “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” and looming concerns over the fate of late-night TV as the Trump administration continues to target media. Many have speculated that Colbert’s cancellation was due to him criticizing a settlement between Trump and CBS’ parent company, Paramount Global. Colbert himself referenced the axing of his show earlier at the Emmys when he joked about looking for a new job once his show concludes next year. Advertisement

If you haven’t watched “The Penguin,” you MUST watch for Cristin Milioti’s performance. Wow. I'm so glad to see her win this award!I also loved Michelle Williams in "Dying For Sex," but there's something about Milioti's performance that really sticks with you.Now, give us Season 2, HBO!Advertisement

But a Beyoncé Emmy win would’ve been so much more fun. Or another one for Kendrick Lamar’s Super Bowl halftime show — then again, we probably would’ve just gotten more tired Drake jokes from that.

Bravo. The writing team won for "The Studio" episode "The Promotion."Like I said before, “The Studio” may very well sweep for comedy tonight. It’s already broken the record for most awarded comedy at the Emmys ever. I haven’t seen this much buzz over a new comedy since the breakout days of “Abbott Elementary,” so it is certainly on a roll.

That style decision made by Philip Barantini helped him clinch this win for one of the most talked-about shows of the year. “Adolescence” is still up for the Outstanding Limited or Anthology Series category.Advertisement

It makes sense that Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg won this award. They really captured lightning in a bottle with their show. I wouldn’t be surprised if they swept the rest of these comedy categories tonight.Advertisement
1 hr 15 mins agoErin E. EvansHBO‘Hacks’ To End With Fifth SeasonOf all nights to find out that “Hacks” is ending on its fifth season? When Hannah Einbinder finally nabs her first Emmy for her role? Einbinder told E! host Heather McMahan that the HBO Max series will end with its next season. “We’re going to start [filming] next week, and knowing it’s the last season is really bittersweet,” Einbinder said on the Emmys red carpet. “But I think it’s right, you know? It’s nice to do something as many times as it should be done. Not overstay your welcome. Rip it and do it and laugh and cry.”I’ll be crying next year on that finale for sure. In between all the laughs, of course.Advertisement

Aside from Deborah (and Megan Stalter’s Kayla), Ava is the comedic heart of the show and it’s about time she got recognized. I’m also happy that Einbinder went over the 45-second time limit to not only soak in her moment, but also slip in “fuck ICE” and “Free Palestine” mentions before she left the stage. She made this win count. Advertisement

The competition in this category was stacked, especially with all the “White Lotus” nominees; I never even saw Katherine LaNasa as a front-runner. But this is such a huge win for “The Pitt” and all the incredible acting on that show. More of this tonight, please. — NjeraAdvertisement

It’s actually pretty impressive that she’s won this award for all four seasons now. Deborah Vance is one of the funniest characters on television, so I’m glad the Television Academy knows that, too. — NjeraAdvertisement

If people manage to keep their thank yous brief, however, Bargatze promised to add one grand for every second saved.The first-time Emmys host wasn't sure how things would pan out, but joked he was a bit worried it could cost him a lot if people were too good at keeping things short and sweet.“It could get wild. That means everybody gotta give their time up," he told Kimmel. "If everybody gave it away, it would be a ton of money. The ones that go long, that’s fine. Get me down to like 10 grand, all right?"See More UpdatesAdvertisement
