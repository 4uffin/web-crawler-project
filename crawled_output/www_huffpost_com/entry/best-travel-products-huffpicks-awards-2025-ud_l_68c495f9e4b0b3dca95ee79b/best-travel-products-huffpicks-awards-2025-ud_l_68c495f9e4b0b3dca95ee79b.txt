1TargetA "suitcase in a backpack" that's beloved by hundreds of Target shoppersRating: 4.7 out of 5 stars at TargetWhether you're a never-check-a-bag traveler or like to make the most of your carry on, few things will get your father than Target's Open Story 35-liter travel backpack. The bag has taken off with HuffPost readers since we initially covered it, likely because as the reviews say it “[w]ears like a backpack, stores like a suitcase!”Available in five colors, it's packed with great features like interior mesh compartments, a full zipper opening, padded shoulder straps, a trolley sleeve, and a spot for your 17-inch laptop and work needs. It gives you ample space for toiletries, some clothes and other travel needs without being too bulky or sporty. Users say the size is “perfect for avoiding carry-on fees for air travel,” and even a “must-buy” if you fly Spirit or Frontier, or simply don’t want to check a bag. $50 at Target2AmazonA convenient portable power station that’s one shopping writer’s “greatest asset”Rating: 4.7 out of 5 stars at AmazonPortable power stations have taken off in the last few years — and for good reason. Unlike traditional generators that demand oil and gas, give off noxious fumes and can be super loud and cumbersome, these sleek machines are silent, electric and easy to pack in a car or keep in the basement.While there are many on the market, the Jackery Explorer 1000 is an editor and reader fave at HuffPost for its large output capacity and compact shape. Reviewers love it for keeping a mini fridge running during hurricane season and charging tablets and phones during camping. It boasts eight outlets: three AC, two USB-As (one with quick charge), two USB-C ports with PD and a car outlet. I have a slightly different model, the Jackery 1500, and it‘s truly my greatest asset and the gift that keeps on giving. (The 1000 comes at an excellent price point and still offers plenty of power.) You'll be happy to have it if the power goes out or if you just want to blend up frozen margaritas on the beach. $449 at Amazon$699 at Jackery3AmazonThe ever-popular Owala FreeSip insulated water bottleRating: 4.6 out of 5 stars at AmazonWhen former shopping writer Haley Zovickian first wrote about the Owala FreeSip, she bravely said it was coming for the viral 40-ounce Stanley — and she was right. “The first feature that sets the Owala apart from the rest? Its innovative FreeSip spout, a ‘genius’ dual drinking spout that acts as both a straw and a regular thermos-style opening,” Zovickian wrote. “You can either sip from an internal straw or tip the bottle to swig its contents without having to make any adjustments,” former HuffPost shopping editor Janie Campbell said. It’s hard to overstate the vessel’s popularity. It’s racked up an impressive 73,000+ reviews at Amazon, over 15,000 at Target and 22,000+ at Walmart. (We could keep going, because you can also shop the bottle at Dick’s, Urban Outfitters and Owala’s direct site, but you get the picture.) On Amazon, we counted over 2,000 reviews that used the word “best” and over 1,000 that cited “favorite.” HuffPost executive editor Kate Palmer is among the bottle’s many fans: “I have a few and love them like no other bottle I've owned. I also love that the name comes from the fact that you look like a koala when you are drinking,” she added, referencing a convincing (but unconfirmed) online theory about Owala’s branding. “They just sip differently,” commented security director Greta Geiselman. Shopping editor Kevin Cortez has tried over 20 water bottles is “one of four I’ve kept over the years.”The locking, leakproof lid makes it great for taking on the go, and the brand's promise to keep your drink cold for up to 24 hours makes it a great option for long travel days. The Owalas come in a ton of great color combos, with neutral and vibrant options in four sizes. $30 at Amazon$30 at WalmartAdvertisement
4TargetA verifiable luxury-lookalike Target hardshell suitcaseRating: 4.4 out of 5 stars at TargetSenior shopping writer and certified jet setter Lourdes Avila Uribe swears by this hardside spinner carry-on from none other than Targét boutique, and claims it rivals the look and durability of much pricier brands, Uribe wrote, “Not only am I able to stuff a lot of clothing and personal items into this carry-on, but I find that it looks, glides and functions nearly identically to my partner’s far more expensive carry-on, which is from the internet-famous luggage brand Away.” It also has over 100 reviews at Target’s website, where customer K_Slade claimed to have logged over 10,000 miles with the bag. “I’ve lived out of this suitcase for nearly two months now, and it has lasted and still going strong,” they wrote. “Comfortably fits a weeks worth with toiletries and shoes. Great for the money!”Measuring 21.75 inches by 14.25 inches by 9.75 inches, with two inches of expansion, you can use it as a carry-on for most major airlines. With a generous internal zipper compartment and an open section equipped with cross straps for securing the contents, you'll have room for everything you need. Enjoy the retractable handle, eight wheels, top and side handles and water-resistant hard exterior that comes in six colors. $100 at TargetAdvertisement
5AmazonA pair of motion-sickness prevention glasses that multiple HuffPosters swear byRating: 4.2 out of 5 stars at AmazonSenior shopping writer Tessa Flores has dealt with severe car sickness nearly her entire life – until recently. In 2022, she grabbed a pair of these funny-looking motion sickness glasses that promised to relieve the nausea that plagues many folks while traveling in cars, boats or airplanes.“In the name of science (and at the risk of my stomach), I wore the glasses sitting in the backseat of the car, while reading, as my partner drove around,” Flores wrote in previous coverage. “Normally, and especially under these circumstances, it would take less than a few minutes for the nausea and headaches to hit. But this time, my symptoms never came.” (Be sure to check out our Instagram reel to see Flores test-drive the spetacles – literally – in real time.)Uribe, who is also prone to motion-sickness, was influenced by Flores to purchase the glasses as well. “I've had them for years now and literally do not leave the city without them,” she said. “They saved me driving around Australia and also in Mexico City – and that traffic kills me.”In an effort to understand why the glasses were so effective, Flores spoke to Dr. Neil Bhattacharyya, board-certified otolaryngologist and professor of otolaryngology at Massachusetts Eye and Ear and Harvard Medical School, who said they likely work by creating an “artificial horizon” for your eyes with the moving liquid in the rings. “The brain depends on sensory input from many organ systems, such as the eyes and inner ear, to tell if the body is in motion and where it’s positioned in space,” Bhattacharyya said. “When you get into a car that’s moving, your organ systems are still sensing the motion around you, but the body itself is stable, causing the integration of those messages to get disrupted.”While he didn't personally endorse the glasses, he explained they may help you find stability (and therefore less puking) on the go. $10 at Amazon6AmazonA UV cooling umbrella your neighbors will ask you aboutRating: 4.1 out of 5 stars at AmazonWhen HuffPost editorial director Kristen Aiken saw her elegant, older neighbor strolling “cool as a cucumber” in the blazing midsummer sun under an umbrella, she had questions. Luckily for us, her neighbor had answers – she was using a cooling UV umbrella, which boasts a specially designed cover that protects against UV rays (though it can be used in the rain too) and promises to keep you noticeably cooler under its shade.When we wrote about this inventive sun protection device, it became a clear reader favorite, thanks to its easy one-button open feature, an anti-glare underside and double-canopy design with a mesh insert for extra ventilation. Weighing just under a pound and collapsing to 11 inches, it’s easy to take on the go as added sun protection.Reviewers love it for travel: “Took it on a trip to a very hot, humid country,” wrote Msparks on Amazon. “Was the envy of others in the group who hadn't thought of it.” Reviewer Travel Junkie, who brought the umbrella to India for a monthlong voyage, “used it daily” and found it “[seemed] to lower outside temp by 10-15 degrees, so not only protected but also lot cooler.“$41 at Amazon$55 at CoolibarAdvertisement
7AmazonA personal water purifier with over 120,000 Amazon ratingsRating: 4.8 out of 5 stars at AmazonIn the universe of HuffPost shopping, this LifeStraw personal water purifier would be its own planet. It's a compact, handheld tool about as long as a fork that turns nearly any water safe for drinking.Survivalist Ky Furneaux first recommended it to HuffPost, saying that anyone venturing outside should keep one handy as a precaution. “It’s light and doesn’t take up much room so it isn’t a huge inconvenience for something that may save your life,” she said, adding that “just knowing that water purification is taken care of takes a load off your mind and allows you to fully focus on other needs.”“It can remove microplastics, bacteria, parasites and more (including E. coli, salmonella and giardia) from just about any water source," Uribe wrote in our previous coverage. "One single filter has a long lifespan, providing about 1,000 gallons of clean and safe drinking water — making it well worth the price tag.”While this is an easy “yes” for hikers and campers navigating water sources in the great outdoors, Uribe notes it can be a smart purchase for travelers and city slickers alike. "Even if you’re not big on the great outdoors, there’s no denying that there’s enough global instability to make one a bit nervous — and the existence of natural disasters alone is a good enough reason to have one in an emergency kit," she said. Over 120,000 Amazon reviewers have helped the product earn a rare 4.8-star rating, $15 at Amazon$17 at Target8AmazonA seatbelt cutter that offers hundreds of reviewers great peace of mindRating: 4.7 out of 5 stars at AmazonYou never want to think about car accidents, but that shouldn't stop you from being prepared. A recommendation from mechanic Philip Campione of Philadelphia’s AC Auto Repairs that became a fan favorite with HuffPost readers, this compact glass breaker and seatbelt cutter is a small tool that has the potential to make a big impact in a dangerous situation. This dual-headed safety hammer has a pointed spike with a protective cap, a flat-head hammer and a sharp blade to cut seatbelts. It has a 4.7-star rating and over 200 5-star reviews. “I love the security of having these in my cars,” wrote Rachel C, echoing the sentiment of many. Jenn Riley wrote that they “[b]ought one for all my kids to have in their car.” Add this one to your arsenal of road-trip essentials before you hit the highway. $12 at Amazon2-pack: $32 at Walmart9MonosA splurgeworthy Monos suitcase that’s endorsed by a HuffPoster who’s incapable of traveling lightRating: 4.9 out of 5 stars at Monos“I have many life skills, but packing light isn’t one of them,” wrote Flores. That’s why we listened carefully when she called her Monos suitcase a “splurge that's worth every penny” – who better to evaluate the effectiveness and ease of a pricey suitcase than a chronic over-packer? “To any other future travelers out there who are in the market for new luggage,” she proclaimed, “I couldn’t endorse it more.”For Flores, this suitcase beats the rest because of its slightly oversized, double-sided wheels that are easy to roll, covered in thick, durable rubber and can glide even on gravel. “Another decision-confirming factor was how thoughtfully designed the Monos suitcase is. Separating the generous interior is a two-page divider featuring dual layers of organization pockets — a welcome difference from most suitcases I’ve seen, which typically have only a single panel of pockets,” she wrote. “One of these layers also offers an extra dose compression in addition to the typical X-strap you find in suitcases. This means I’m able to pack more clothes and more shoes compared to my old bag, while also staying significantly more organized. The bag even comes with two different-sized shoe sleeves!”The hard exterior is made from an aerospace-grade polycarbonate, featuring an integrated TSA-approved lock and aluminum telescoping handle. $275 at MonosAdvertisement
