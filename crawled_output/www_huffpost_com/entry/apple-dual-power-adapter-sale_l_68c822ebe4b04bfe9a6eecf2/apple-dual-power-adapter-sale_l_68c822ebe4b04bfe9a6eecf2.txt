While you can pick up cheapies at a gas station or drug store, I think we all know that the real deal, brand-name Apple adapters tend to work faster and last longer. So, something like this Apple 35W compact power adapter with two USB-C ports is a great buy, especially while it’s 34% off! Considering this was $59 just last month, we can’t imagine this discount lasting long.Deemed “one of the best power adapters on the market” and a “perfect small charger,” it’s a physically smaller version of the standard, currently sold-out adapter, that still offers speed and convenience for charging phones, smart watches, wireless earbuds and even laptops. Many say this versatility and reliability make the price tag “worth it” even at full price, so getting it on sale is just the sugar on top. Advertisement
$39 at Amazon (regularly $59)$39 at walmart (regularly $59)“Hands down one of the best chargers I’ve used,” one wrote. “It charges my iPhone super fast, and I love that I can plug in another device at the same time.” Designed for fast charging, with two ports, Apple says you can use this adaptor for most MacBook Air models, as well as nearly every iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPod model. Reviewers mention using non-Apple products with it, too, as long as the input cord is a USB-C. Note: this listing is just for the adapter and doesn’t come with cables, but the Apple brand USB-C to USB-C and USB-C to Lightning are also both on sale right now, wink, wink. Advertisement
Users love the dual ports, which allow you to juice two devices at once, as one reviewer said the dual design “saves space and looks better with the ports at the bottom.”$39 at Amazon (regularly $59)$39 at walmart (regularly $59)“It smartly splits the power if two things are plugged in at once,” one reviewer wrote. “[If] one of the things is a low watt [device,] such as an Apple Watch or AirPods, then it gives the higher-wattage, things such as a MacBook or iPad, more wattage instead of just 50/50.”Advertisement
Calling it “powerful, efficient and exactly what you’d expect from Apple quality,” reviewers love the power and ease of this adapter, mentioning how great it is to pack up and travel with. With retractable prongs, it can easily go flat to slip into a bag. When plugged into an outlet, it has a lower profile, making your net of wires a little easier on the eyes. And while it’s on sale, it’s also easier on your wallet. $39 at Amazon (regularly $59)$39 at walmart (regularly $59)Want to know more? Check out these 5-star reviews of Apple’s 35W dual USB-C port power adapter.“Even if you’re not a giant apple fan, this is a great powerful charger for the size. Charges my phone / laptop / watch and iPad reliably and is super compact. It’s a little bit expensive but it seems all chargers are these days, and the Apple reliability is worth it in my books. I’ve seen a few people say these on Amazon are counterfeit but I cannot distinguish this from the one that shipped with my MacBook, so if it is somehow a fake, It’s a great one. Having dual ports on a charger this small has been amazing as well.” — ArtKottRamathorn“This has come in handy at work for me many times. I like that it allows me to charge multiple devices and when you have 2 work phones on top of your personal phone it comes in very handy. It is easy to use, functions just as it says it should. The size and compactness makes it easy to travel with. I do think that they could have spaced out the ports but it still works as is!” — tresia danielle williams“This is probably one of the Best item I’ve bought on amazon. I use it every day, either charging my iPhone with MagSafe charger and/or charging my iPad at the same time. Charging speed is fantastic and the size is small enough to easily carry with you on trips. This item works great and never have an issue with it. I encourage you to go ahead and spend the money and getting this idea.” — AndrewLove a handy gadget?
