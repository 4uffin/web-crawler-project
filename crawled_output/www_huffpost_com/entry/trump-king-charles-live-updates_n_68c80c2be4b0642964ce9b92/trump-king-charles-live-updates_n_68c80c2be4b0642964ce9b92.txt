I am sorry to involve you." The roommate responds, "you weren’t the one who did it right????" to which Robinson replies, "I am, I’m sorry."When asked why he did it, the indictment shows Robinson saying he'd "had enough of his hatred."The alleged texts also show him optimistic he'd get away with the attack. One reads: "If I am able to grab my rifle unseen, I will have left no evidence. Going to attempt to retrieve it again, hopefully they have moved on.
