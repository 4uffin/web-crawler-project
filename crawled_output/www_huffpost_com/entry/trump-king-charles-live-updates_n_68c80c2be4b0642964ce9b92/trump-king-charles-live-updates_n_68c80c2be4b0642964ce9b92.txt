3 minutes agoLi Zhouvia Associated PressACLU Decries ABC’s Kimmel Move As ‘Grave Threat‘ To First AmendmentThe ACLU decried ABC’s decision to pull ‘Jimmy Kimmel Live’ off air, noting that it represented a “grave threat to our First Amendment freedoms.”“Jimmy Kimmel is the latest target of the Trump administration’s unconstitutional plan to silence its critics and control what the American people watch and read,” Christopher Anders, director of the Democracy and Technology Division at the ACLU, said in a statement. “Cowering to threats, ABC and the biggest owner of its affiliate stations gave the Trump FCC chairman exactly what he wanted by suspending Kimmel indefinitely and dropping the show.”ABC’s decision followed threats by Trump FCC Chair Brendan Carr, who urged the network to take action over Kimmel’s comments and warned that the agency could revoke licenses for individual broadcasters.“The Trump administration's actions, paired with ABC's capitulation, represent a grave threat to our First Amendment freedoms,” Anders said.Advertisement

"This is not complicated: Trump's FCC identified speech it did not like and threatened ABC with extreme reprisals," the American Federation of Musicians of the United States and Canada wrote in a statement. "This is state censorship. It is now happening in the United States of America, not some far-off country." ABC's decision came after FCC Chair Brendan Carr urged the network to take action over Kimmel's comments and suggested that individual broadcasters could face penalties. Shortly thereafter, Nexstar, which operates a number of ABC affiliates, said it would stop airing the show. Advertisement

Vance pinned the blame for Charlie Kirk's killing on "left-wing political radicalization" in an interview on Fox News's "Jesse Watters Primetime" on Wednesday. "My friend is dead because of left-wing political radicalization," Vance claimed. "This is a person who grew up in a pretty normal family, actually had a pretty good home life, who was radicalized by the far left, by the social networks of the far left, by the ideas of the far left, and got so far down the path of radicalization that he killed my friend."Vance's comments add to numerous statements Republicans have made, casting blame on "the radical left" and calling for investigations into left-leaning organizations, even though authorities haven't linked the shooter's action to any groups. Authorities have said they believe the shooter ascribed to "leftist ideology" and disclosed alleged texts which show him saying he had "enough of [Kirk's] hatred, but they've stopped short of providing a more detailed motive.Vance and Trump have also faced criticism for vocally denouncing political violence on the left while failing to do the same for political violence on the right.

In fact, not only have you set foot on British soil twice in the last two months alone, but I understand that British soil makes for rather splendid golf courses,” Charles said.The monarch also praised Trump for his diplomatic efforts in various conflicts while framing the U.S. and U.K. as a united front that’s dedicated to combating “tyranny” and bolstering Ukraine.“Our countries are working together in support of crucial diplomatic efforts, not least of which, Mr. President, is your own personal commitment to finding solutions to some of the world's most intractable conflicts, in order to secure peace,” Charles said.Trump’s visit comes as British leaders aim to finalize the terms of a trade deal with the U.S. and as European countries have urged the president to firmly back Ukraine as Russia continues its offensive.

"Do you deny this?"Patel seemed dumbfounded as to who Roof, who has been sentenced to death, even is."I'm sorry, um, Dylann Roof?" Patel asked. "Roof?" Kamlager-Dove repeated."Roof? Can you give me some more information?" Patel asked."You're head of the FBI, you probably know this," Kamlager-Dove replied. "If you don’t know, that’s fine.""If you can give me a reminder, I’ve got a lot in front of me," Patel said."It was national news," Kamlager-Dove said.

Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) is proposing AI companies to contribute some of their “enormous profits” to a fund dedicated to helping American workers and communities grapple with likely job losses and infrastructure strain caused by the technology, a sign the Democratic Party is beginning to wrestle with what is expected to be a major fault line in politics over the next decade.Kelly, a swing-state senator and potential 2028 presidential candidate, rolled out the idea in a white paper aiming to create “an AI boom for all, not another tech bubble for the few.” He’s unlikely to be the only major Democrat with ideas for how the party should grapple with a technology projected to replace 7% of all American jobs over the next decade and change the way millions more jobs function. The speed and size of the changes could move AI from being a boardroom concern today to a kitchen table concern by the time voters head to the polls in 2028.Read more:Advertisement
Sep 17, 2025, 11:18 AM EDTSebastian MurdockMonarez Is ‘Very Nervous’ About New CDC RecommendationsDuring Wednesday’s Senate testimony, ousted CDC Director Susan Monarez said she’s “very nervous” about new recommendations from the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP.Under RFK Jr., a new team of largely unqualified members on the ACIP have sought to change the childhood vaccination schedule, among other things.“The newly chosen ACIP members met in June, and they’re going to meet again tomorrow,” Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) said during the hearing. “Will you, either of you, feel confident telling parents they can now trust the ACIP recommendations that come out of this week’s meeting?”“I’m very nervous about it,” Monarez replied. “I don’t know, they haven’t met yet. I know that the medical community has raised concerns about whether or not they have the commensurate backgrounds to be able to understand the data and the evidence and to evaluate it appropriately.”Dr. Debra Houry, who resigned from the CDC following Monarez’s firing, said she had “significant concerns.”“I have significant concerns, as the public hasn’t been able to weigh in,” Houry said. She added that it’s “unclear to me what decisions are being made.”Advertisement
Sep 17, 2025, 11:02 AM EDTSebastian MurdockRFK Jr. Had No Evidence To Back Up Changes To Childhood Vaccine Schedule: MonarezOusted CDC Director Susan Monarez said she was fired by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. for refusing to follow his orders that were not based in facts or science.Speaking before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions on Wednesday, Monarez said Kennedy wanted “blanket approval” to make changes to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP.“He just wanted blanket approval,” Monarez said of Kennedy. “And if I could not commit to approval of each and every one of the recommendations that would be forthcoming, I needed to resign. I did not resign, and that is when he told me he had already spoken to the White House about having me removed.”Part of Kennedy’s demand was to change the childhood vaccine schedule. In June, Kennedy fired all 17 members of the existing ACIP and replaced them with a smaller section of his own to alter the childhood vaccination schedule. Monarez said Kennedy had no data to back up the change.“He did not have any data or science to point to,” Monarez said. “As a matter of fact, we got into an exchange where I had suggested I would be open to changing childhood vaccine schedules, if the evidence or science were supportive. And he responded that there was no science or evidence associated with a childhood vaccine schedule.”“To be clear, he said there was no science or data, but that he still expected you to change the schedule?”
Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) asked.“Correct,” Monarez responded.See More UpdatesAdvertisement
