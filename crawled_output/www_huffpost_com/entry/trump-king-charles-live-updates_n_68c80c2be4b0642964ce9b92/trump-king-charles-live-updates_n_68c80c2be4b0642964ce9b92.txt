Instead, Trump and his anti-democratic radicals look to be readying a campaign to destroy dissent,” Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) wrote in the first of a series of social media posts on Sunday.Read more here.Advertisement

One possible candidate for his replacement is former Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, who is expected to be sworn in to a top role at the FBI today. In an unusual arrangement, Bailey will be sharing Deputy FBI Director Dan Bongino’s role; Fox reports that Bongino’s days may also be numbered.Patel’s performance has been scrutinized amid his highly public missteps during the race to find Charlie Kirk’s killer last week. Trump, however, has continued to back him. Read more here.Advertisement
54 minutes agoGraeme DemianykKash Patel Defends Bungled Posts During Charlie Kirk InvestigationFBI Director Kash Patel said he has no regrets about bungled social media messages he posted while overseeing the investigation into the killing of Charlie Kirk.The former podcaster has faced fierce criticism for posts he made the day of the shooting amid reports he was dining at a high-end Italian restaurant in New York City at the time.On Wednesday evening, Patel posted that “the subject” in Kirk’s killing was “in custody.”Around 90 minutes later, he posted another message saying the “subject in custody has been released after an interrogation by law enforcement.”“Could I have worded it a little better in the heat of the moment? Sure,” Patel said on “Fox & Friends” on Monday when asked about the “we got him” posts. “But do I regret putting it out? Absolutely not.”He added that he would “challenge anyone out there to find a director that has been more transparent and more willing to work the media on high-profile cases, or any case the FBI is handling, than we have been under my leadership.”Kilmeade: You posted that we got him and that ended up not being true…Patel: I was being transparent… The job of the FBI is not just to manhunt the actual suspect, but it’s also to eliminate targets and subjects who are not involved. Could I have worded it a little better?… pic.twitter.com/flc5YoRpBd— Acyn (@Acyn) September 15, 2025Advertisement

"We were in substantial contact with President Trump last night and then again today."Asked about who will retain control of the algorithm, Bessent declined to discuss the commercial terms of the deal.U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer added that the deal negotiated addressed the concerns of both sides."We were very focused on TikTok and making sure that it was a deal that is fair for the Chinese and completely respects U.S. national security concerns, and that’s the deal we reached," Greer said.Bessent’s comments came after Trump suggested that the future of the popular social media platform in the U.S. has been secured."A deal was also reached on a ‘certain’ company that young people in our Country very much wanted to save," Trump wrote on Truth Social. "They will be very happy!"TikTok’s future had been uncertain since former President Joe Biden signed legislation into law passed by Congress requiring ByteDance, TikTok’s China-based parent company, to divest the app or face a nationwide ban over concerns about national security.Trump has already extended a deadline for TikTok’s sale three times since taking office with the latest one coming up on Wednesday.Advertisement

1 hr 33 mins agoAndy CampbellTrump Threatens DC With New Federal Crackdown After Mayor Vows To Separate MPD And ICETrump on Monday morning posted a slew of lies and threats aimed at D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, who said last week that local police would stop making federal immigration arrests once the president's 30-day emergency declaration expired.In a post on Truth Social, Trump claimed that his declaration — which essentially compelled Metropolitan Police to work as ICE agents — led to "virtually NO CRIME" in D.C. and "booming" economic growth for local businesses. While some crime (especially carjackings) dipped amid Trump's takeover, business isn't exactly booming; local business owners across Washington reported plummeting sales and patronage.Last week Bowser said the MPD's work with ICE would expire along with Trump's emergency declaration, and the president isn't happy."To the people and businesses of Washington, D.C., DON’T WORRY, I AM WITH YOU, AND WON’T ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN," Trump wrote. "I’ll call a National Emergency, and Federalize, if necessary!!!"Advertisement
