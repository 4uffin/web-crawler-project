He also took issue with its prior endorsement of former Vice President Kamala Harris, which he described as being put "dead center on the front page of The New York Times, something heretofore UNHEARD OF!"The lawsuit adds to a slew of others that Trump has filed, which have raised serious concerns about press freedom. A New York Times spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Advertisement

"A woman stood up and just started screaming. She got booed out of the place, too.""She was a paid agitator," he said. "And you have a lot of them. And I've asked Pam [Bondi] to look into that in terms of RICO, bringing RICO cases against them, criminal RICO, because they should be put in jail. What they are doing to this country is really subversive." Trump also said he'd support designating Antifa and other far-left groups as domestic terrorists."It's something I would do, yeah," he said when asked about the issue. "I think we'd start with Pam, I think, but... I would do that 100 percent.""Antifa is terrible," he said. "There are groups, yeah, we have some pretty radical groups and they got away with murder."Trump: They started to scream when I got into a restaurant, something with Palestine. I said I'm doing a great job for peace in the Middle East, I should get lots of awards with that. She was a paid agitator.

Plus, we have recorded evidence that they were leaving.”Trump announced the strike, which occurred on Monday, via a Truth Social post, marking the second time in recent months that the U.S. military has launched a fatal attack on a Venezuelan boat accused of carrying drugs rather than intercepting it as was common practice in the past. Trump’s actions have prompted scrutiny from Democratic lawmakers and some Republicans, who’ve raised concerns about the lack of information provided about these vessels' passengers and whether the strikes legally fall within the executive branch's military powers. Trump argued Monday that the military actions were having a deterring effect on Venezuelan vessels attempting to smuggle drugs. “There are no ships in the ocean anymore ... now there are no boats. I wonder why? Meaning, no drugs are coming across,” he said. Advertisement

Trump was scheduled to arrive back at the White House at around 6:30 p.m., about a half hour after the vigil began at the Kennedy Center."I speak on behalf of the president when I say President Trump loved you, Charlie, so much," White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said at the vigil, which was attended by dozens of Republican lawmakers and key Trump allies.Trump has said that he plans to attend and speak at the influencer's memorial in Arizona on Sunday.Advertisement

He was all about young people, getting them started right.”Trump has praised Kirk for his ability to reach young voters, and the president has sought to blame the rhetoric of the “radical left” (without evidence) for the conservative activist’s killing."I got tremendous numbers with youth. By the way, I want to say, Charlie helped me,” Trump said. “He used to say to me, get on TikTok. Charlie was unbelievable."Advertisement
11 hrs 55 mins agoLi ZhouSAUL LOEB via Getty ImagesTrump Greenlights Federal Agents, National Guard For So-Called Crime Crackdown In MemphisTrump on Monday signed a presidential memorandum formally greenlighting a surge of federal agents and National Guard to Memphis as he targets the city for his latest purported crackdown on crime. “I’m signing a presidential memorandum to establish the Memphis Safe taskforce,” Trump announced. “This taskforce will be a replica of our extraordinarily successful efforts [in D.C.]. The effort will include the National Guard as well as the FBI, ATF, DEA, ICE, Homeland Security Investigations and the U.S. Marshals.”“This team will deploy the full powers of federal law enforcement agencies…to restore public safety and get dangerous career criminals off of our streets,” he added. The move marks an expansion of Trump’s efforts to surge federal agents and troops to Democrat-led cities in an alleged bid to address crime and ramp up immigration enforcement. Trump’s decision to go to Memphis comes after Chicago leaders vehemently warned him against attempting a deployment there — and is bolstered by the support of Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee (R), who’s said that he backs the use of the state’s National Guard. Democratic leaders in the region have stressed the need to address crime, but emphasized that Trump’s use of the National Guard was only going to make residents feel less safe. According to an Axios analysis of 2024 FBI data, Memphis had one of the highest violent crime rates of any U.S. city with a population of 100,000 people or more, though it’s seen declines of certain crimes like homicides in 2025. Trump cited the influence of a board member of FedEx who allegedly described needing an armored vehicle to drive one block in the city as a factor in his decision. Memphis Mayor Paul Young was among those who said that he was “not happy” with the president’s actions and who cited other efforts by the city that he found effective at addressing crime. “We’re going to make Memphis safe again,” Trump claimed, adding that he still intended to dispatch similar deployments to other cities. "Get ready because you’re going to be doing a lot of other places that are almost as troubled.” Advertisement

Sep 15, 2025, 4:32 PM EDTRyan GrenobleTrump Ordered The Military To Blow Up Another Suspected Drug BoatTrump used social media Monday to announce the U.S. military, at his direction, fired on a boat of civilians in international waters without due process, killing them.Trump asserted without evidence that the people aboard the boat were “confirmed narcoterrorists” who were “transporting illegal narcotics” to the U.S. It’s unclear if those aboard the boat were afforded the chance to surrender prior to the fatal attack.A video shared alongside Trump’s post shows a vessel with at least two people aboard, bobbing up and down with the waves until they’re engulfed in a ball of fire. Once the smoke clears, a flaming hull is all the remains. Trump said the strike killed three people.Monday’s attack is the second time the Trump administration has blown up a suspected drug vessel instead of intercepting it, as the U.S. government has long previously done.The Trump administration has offered no legal argument to justify the extrajudicial killings.Vice President JD Vance said earlier this month he “doesn’t give a shit” if the Trump administration's strikes are considered war crimes.On Saturday, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yván Gil said the U.S. Navy illegally raided a Venezuelan flagged vessel in Venezuelan waters — that turned out to be a tuna boat.Advertisement

Sep 15, 2025, 2:43 PM EDTRyan GrenobleTrump Calls For An End To Quarterly Earnings ReportsTrump on Monday floated the idea of eliminating a fixture of Wall Street traders and financial analysts everywhere: quarterly earnings reports, which he called “Not good!!!” in a social media post.“Companies and Corporations should no longer be forced to ‘Report’ on a quarterly basis (Quarterly Reporting!), but rather to Report on a ‘Six (6) Month Basis,’" Trump wrote. “This will save money, and allow managers to focus on properly running their companies.”Conveniently for Trump, semi-annual reporting would also help him dodge responsibility for terrible earnings reports brought about by his on-again, off-again tariffs.It would also lend itself to less transparency in publicly traded companies, Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management, told CNBC.“When you weigh this out and put it on a whiteboard, the pros of quarterly reporting outweigh the cons,” Hogan said. “Having to wait six months for official results, I just think would cause more difficulties than it would add benefits.”Advertisement
