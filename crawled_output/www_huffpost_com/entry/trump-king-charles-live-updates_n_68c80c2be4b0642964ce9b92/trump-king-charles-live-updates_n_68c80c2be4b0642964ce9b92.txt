16 minutes agoRyan GrenobleTrump Calls For An End To Quarterly Earnings ReportsTrump on Monday floated the idea of eliminating a fixture of Wall Street traders and financial analysts everywhere: quarterly earnings reports, which he called “Not good!!!” in a social media post.“Companies and Corporations should no longer be forced to ‘Report’ on a quarterly basis (Quarterly Reporting!), but rather to Report on a ‘Six (6) Month Basis,’" Trump wrote. “This will save money, and allow managers to focus on properly running their companies.”Conveniently for Trump, semi-annual reporting would also help him dodge responsibility for terrible earnings reports brought about by his on-again, off-again tariffs.It would also lend itself to less transparency in publicly traded companies, Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management, told CNBC.“When you weigh this out and put it on a whiteboard, the pros of quarterly reporting outweigh the cons,” Hogan said. “Having to wait six months for official results, I just think would cause more difficulties than it would add benefits.”Advertisement
