Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.).In his 2023 book “Government Gangsters,” Patel set out a vision for cracking down on the “deep state.”In the book’s appendix, the former federal prosecutor detailed a 60-name roster of current and former government officials whom he called “Members of the Executive Branch Deep State.”Whitehouse claimed Patel had taken “adverse actions” against about 20 of the people on the “enemies list,” and suggested at the current rate “you've got 14 months until you've hit all 60.”“That is an entirely inaccurate presupposition,” Patel replied. “I do not have an enemies list. You can continue to characterize it as you wish.”Advertisement

Spencer Cox's remarks condemning violence in the aftermath of Charlie Kirk's assassination, Trump said he agreed, but again claimed there is violence "on the left." "I agree with him 100%," Trump told White House reporters Tuesday. "But most of the violence is on the left."This is just Trump's latest attempt to smear Democrats after Kirk's murder. Before police even had a suspect in custody, Trump said, "We have radical left lunatics out there and we just have to beat the hell out of them."Kirk's murder suspect's political affiliation is still unknown. His political party is undeclared, and the shell casings recovered from the scene were engraved with sayings that some believe had fascist ideology. Cox previously said the shooter had a "leftist ideology."Advertisement

"A woman stood up and just started screaming. She got booed out of the place, too.""She was a paid agitator," he said. "And you have a lot of them. And I've asked Pam [Bondi] to look into that in terms of RICO, bringing RICO cases against them, criminal RICO, because they should be put in jail. What they are doing to this country is really subversive." Trump also said he'd support designating Antifa and other far-left groups as domestic terrorists."It's something I would do, yeah," he said when asked about the issue. "I think we'd start with Pam, I think, but... I would do that 100 percent.""Antifa is terrible," he said. "There are groups, yeah, we have some pretty radical groups and they got away with murder."Trump: They started to scream when I got into a restaurant, something with Palestine.

Sep 15, 2025, 6:53 PM EDTLi ZhouKevin Dietsch via Getty ImagesTrump Gives Few Specifics When Asked For Evidence Of Narcoterrorism On Venezuelan BoatTrump provided few specifics when asked if he had proof that a Venezuelan boat shot down by the U.S. military was carrying narcoterrorists. “We have proof all you have to do is to look at the cargo, it’s spattered all over the ocean,” Trump said on Monday. “Big bags of cocaine and fentanyl all over the place. Plus, we have recorded evidence that they were leaving.”Trump announced the strike, which occurred on Monday, via a Truth Social post, marking the second time in recent months that the U.S. military has launched a fatal attack on a Venezuelan boat accused of carrying drugs rather than intercepting it as was common practice in the past. Trump’s actions have prompted scrutiny from Democratic lawmakers and some Republicans, who’ve raised concerns about the lack of information provided about these vessels' passengers and whether the strikes legally fall within the executive branch's military powers. Trump argued Monday that the military actions were having a deterring effect on Venezuelan vessels attempting to smuggle drugs. “There are no ships in the ocean anymore ... now there are no boats. I wonder why? Meaning, no drugs are coming across,” he said. Advertisement
