Great for all styles of sleepers (back, stomach, side), they keep their shape and feel super plush. They can also go in the washer and dryer for easy cleaning and re-fluffing. Find them in queen and king sizes. Great for: Hot sleepers, people wanting down alternative, anyone who prefers a super plush pillow, stocking your guest room or rental property.

The comfort is CRAZY. The cooling is AMAZING (even with silk pillowcase). Thank you TikTok for influencing me!!!!" — Rickie White"I absolutely love these pillows. I have been on the hunt for yearssss and couldn’t be happier to have stumbled across this brand through a TikTok home influencer. I’m extremely particular and these pillows meet my picky standards." — Deky"I was skeptical at first because I rarely invest in nice beddin...for what reason? Idk! My boyfriend has these at his place and really encouraged me to buy them. I thought my pillows at home were good enough until I bought these. Wow and I mean wow - they are so comfortable and I've gotten incredible sleep ever since buying them. Hate to say it but he was right and I'm so satisfied with my purchase. Saving for the future when I need a pillow refresh!" — Jen Menninger "I have never slept better then I have on this pillow. I don't know why I waited so long to purchase this. I has great reviews for a reason. It is that good! I ordered two and then then next day ordered another two that's how much I reall like these pillows. They are great for back and side sleepers so no matter how you sleep this is a great pillow. Try it!" — Amazonshopper$60 at Amazon2AmazonCoop's adjustable pillowWhat: Versatility is the name of the game with the Coop adjustable pillow.

I saw this pillow on TikTok and it got me curious so I immediately came to Amazon. OMG it’s such a game changer. I’m a side sleeper and this pillow is heaven. It’s some of the most comfortable sleep I have had in ages. I love it so much I bought a second one and have my eye on the body pillow. Obsessed! You need this in your bedroom." — MT"When you get sick of replacing pillows every few months do yourself a big favor and Try COOP Pillows. They will last years and years, covers are washable and comes with a little extra stuffing to adjust how much support you want. They are costly I won’t deny, but after you waste money on the cheap ones every few months you could have bought these once." — Thomas"They received a number one rating in the consumer reports report in 2024 so I figured I would try. They are great, wonderful support, I used to wake up with a stiff neck, not anymore. I like the idea of having extra fill. Definitely worth the expense and getting the waterproof jackets to go over them. Glad I made this purchase." — Jeffrey"I've been searching for a pillow that would give me the support I need as a side sleeper. I've gone through tons of pillows and my neck/shoulder pain would remain. Saw someone recommend this on Reddit and decided to try it. And it was the the right choice. This pillow is insanely comfortable, breathable, and supportive. Within a week my neck and shoulder pain was gone. I sleep like a baby with this pillow. I can't recommend this enough. It's worth every penny" — Jamie Evans$85 at Amazon3AmazonA pair of affordable Bedsure pillowsWhat: At $10 for a two-pack, this set of Bedsure soft and supportive pillows is stuffed with high-grade microfiber in three levels — soft, medium and firm.

Amazon score: 4.3 out of 5 stars; 14,051 stars Promising review: "I've never purchased pillows online before. But i could not find a pillow in store I liked or felt was reasonably priced for the quality. I took a risk in buying these pillows and wow, so happy i did. Soft and true to size. The filling is still plump after weeks of use. I'll be purchasing another set in the future." — Kate"I just bought these to put into my shams, but I’ve kept using them to sleep on because they’re so comfy! Like a cloud honestly, yet supportive at the same time. A miracle basically." — Julia Pierannunzi"These are very comfortable pillows. They keep their shape, they puff right up.

It is easy to fall asleep with this pillow." — Haley"I bought this after seeing tiktoks about ergonomic pillows and I was skeptical to try, but I don’t regret it. I’ve never slept so comfortably in my life that I can actually sleep through the night. I definitely recommend to help with back/neck pain when sleeping. I would definitely buy another one to have as my second pillow." — Taylor D"I bought this around 6 months ago after seeing a ton of people raving about it online. I have always had issues with knots in my shoulders and tension headaches. It provides really good support for my neck and I feel like I wake up with less pain. I like that the insert has different parts you can remove to adjust the height and that the cover is washable. It’s maybe a little warmer than a traditional pillow but nothing too bad. I would definitely buy again!" — Amazon customer"Best pillow ever!! I would change the name to Miracle pillow. My neck and shoulders were sore for months and after one night of sleeping my pain was gone. After 1 week still great. Highly recommend." — Christina$50 at Amazon6AmazonCasper original pillowWhat: Mattress company Casper's original pillow is as beloved as all their other products.

Given it’s probably not for everyone I can honestly say I feel like I really missed out on some good sleep all this time ! This pillow is not too soft not too hard just like the advertisements say my neck feels supported and I feel so refreshed ! I was not given anything for this review- I would absolutely pay full price for this pillow if I had to." — Joyce"This pillow is amazing. It's nice and fluffy, which was a little concerning at first because I like my pillow to be a tad firm, and at first it seemed too flat. When I looked online at reviews I discovered the brand posted a video specifically about how to fluff the pillow and let me tell you... This was a game changer. Now it's fluffy, yet supportive. Moldable but a bit firm. And when it gets a little flat again you just need to fluff it up and you're good to go once more!" — Kymbee8"I didn’t realize it has been nearly 5 years since I first received this pillow. It is the best pillow I have ever had." — lr"Best pillow I have ever purchased. Its fluffy, soft, but firm and holds its shape. This pillow has a removable outer layer for easy washing and provides great neck and shoulder support." —
