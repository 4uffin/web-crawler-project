If you’ve been looking to upgrade to a new pet vacuum or otherwise anti-allergen cleaner, the Shark’s popular Navigator vacuum is under $100 at Walmart for a limited time. And it’s so good that one Walmart reviewer says, “You will never want another vacuum.”$98 at Walmart (regularly $199)Advertisement
You can lift and use it practically anywhere.As the name states, this model has a feature that literally lifts away from the base, allowing you to clean smaller surfaces and furniture more easily, as well as higher, hard-to-reach spots like ceilings and window sills. It has an anti-allergen seal with a HEPA filter and sucks up dust and allergens — letting you breathe easier in your space. The brushroll shutoff feature lets you change seamlessly between carpets and bare hardwood floors. Plus, the swivel steering aids in seamlessly maneuvering your vacuum around tight spots and furniture.WalmartThe Shark Navigator has a helpful "lift-away" function that allow you to clean furniture, stairs and ceiling fans.It also comes with multiple tools.It comes with a wide upholstery tool to better clean pet hair off your couches and chairs (and clothes!) plus a 12-inch crevice tool for dust and dander in smaller spots. Several reviewers say it’s excellent on bare floors, it’s very lightweight and, perhaps the biggest pro, hair doesn’t get tangled in its brush roll.Advertisement
“It goes from area rugs to bare floor seamlessly,” says a reviewer. “It has what they call ‘Zero-M technology’ that ‘actively removes hair wrap from the brushroll as you vacuum.’ Apparently that works well, as I’ve had no need to turn vacuum over and bother with unwinding caught hair (which was problem with other vacuums).”$98 at Walmart (regularly $199)Get one for yourself, your kid or a new pet owner. You won’t regret it, especially at this price. Read more promising reviews of the Shark Navigator Lift-Away pet vacuum below. “So far, so good. I am someone who researches the heck out of something, especially if it is a fairly expensive, long term purchase. I wasn’t sure how each shark compared to the other, feature wise. I didn’t want to sacrifice features I wanted, but I also didn’t want to spend a fortune on a vacuum. After much research, I found this vacuum at Walmart for $199, a deal made just for me. It was corded, bagless, swiveled, had a powered lift off (essentially making it a mini canister), and had the anti tangle rollers (cause hair getting wound around the brush was a huge problem on my last Shark). I ordered it online after I didn’t find it in the store. It arrived within two days! No ship fee, only tax. Came out to $219. Easy to put together, my 15 yr old daughter did it. Took it for a test run around the house and was very, very happy. The dirt canister was easy to detach and empty. It is smaller than the dirt collector on my other machine, but easier to handle because it is smaller...so, a good thing. I don’t usually buy things online, I do not usually buy from Walmart, and I don’t usually review things, but I am very happy with my purchase. The combination of features and price, along with quick delivery, has made this purchase a joy. Yes, I know, what kind of life I must have if purchasing a vacuum online is a joyful thing, but I usually stress out about these kind of purchases. I had a bad feeling that I was going to end up with something over my budget and lacking features I really wanted. So yes, I derived quite a bit of joy knowing deep down that I got everything I wanted for $199 plus tax. Honest review. Not a paid endorsement. Have had the vacuum for about a month. Did also use it to clean out the car. Thanks for reading my review and good luck with your decision. Also, the Facebook Dog group said Shark for pet hair, so that weighed a bit in my decision making process.” — Karen “Shark Navigator Lift-Away is absolutely awesome! I was able to set it up with ease; I had no problems. I love the way this vacuum is light weight, powerful and glides easily around corners and under furniture. It worked really well on my tile, and hardwood floors. Using the vacuum in Lift-Away mode is very simple. All you have to do is press a few buttons to lift it away from the main unit and it’s easy to carry around. I have pets and it was nice to have the crevice tools to use on pet hair and dust. My sofas, and headboard looked like new. I’ve never had a vacuum that allows for full function use, and a lift-away mode which I completely love(genius). Emptying the vacuum was simple, and putting it back on the unit was easy. If you are in the market for a vacuum with these wonderful features, you’ve found the right one in Shark. I am very pleased with my vacuum, and I highly recommend it.” —MzLady “Shark Navigator Lift-Away Zero-M Speed ZU560 Vacuum, you will never want to any other kind. It boasts several features that make that make it the best vacuum I have ever owned. For example, the Zero cleaner head that is designed to keep hair (and string) from wrapping around it. Then there is the hard floor as well as carpet power settings, that allows you to clean your floors no matter what they are. It also has a swiveling head the navigates beautifully. The lightweight (a little more than 13lbs) detachable canister also has HEPA filters that traps all the dirt and dust. The filters are easy to clean with just warm water and a little dish soap; the whole vacuum snaps and unsnaps to come apart so easily my four-year old has no problem taking it apart or putting is back together. The Shark Navigator Lift-Away Zero-M Speed ZU560 Vacuum with its detachable cannister, attachments, HEPA filters that are easy to remove and clean, or the Zero cleaner head, that effectively continuously removes hair from it, this vacuum a dream. So, whether you are buying the Shark Navigator Lift-Away Zero-M Speed ZU560 Vacuum for yourself or as a gift you cannot go wrong.” — cogziegirl$98 at Walmart (regularly $199)Advertisement
