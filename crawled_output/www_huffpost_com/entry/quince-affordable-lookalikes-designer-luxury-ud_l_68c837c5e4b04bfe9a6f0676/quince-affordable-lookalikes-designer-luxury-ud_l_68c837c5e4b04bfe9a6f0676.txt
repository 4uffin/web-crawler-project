Quince delivers.By Erica KamShopping Writer for HuffPostSep 19, 2025, 07:00 AM EDTLEAVE A COMMENTQuinceA smocked dress, candle, handbag and suitcase from Quince.If you’ve been hoping to get into your quiet luxury era without breaking the bank, Quince is the store for you. From cooling linen sheets for under $100 to beloved cashmere sweaters, the retailer has tons of luxurious clothing items and home goods on offer for a much lower price than their high quality might suggest.The brand has some ardent fans among the ranks of HuffPosters — our staffers have previously sung the praises of the brand’s cloud-like cotton gauze pillow shams and linen duvet covers.Advertisement
Quince is also a great place to score on affordable alternatives and lookalikes to expensive designer products. In fact, they’re so known for this that their product pages feature a chart comparing their affordability to similar brands, and reviewers often shout out Quince for providing a cheaper alternative that doesn’t skimp on quality.Below, check out some of the best Quince products that have drawn favorable comparisons to more expensive luxury items you might have had your eye on.1QuinceA carry-on suitcase in five sizesYou know the Away carry-on, and you may also know its $275 price tag. Quince's polycarbonate suitcase, available in three carry-on sizes and two check-in sizes, offers many of the same features — TSA locks, 360-degree wheels, a removable laundry bag — for far less, and is a favorite budget option at both The Strategist and Business Insider. Grab it in seven colors.Promising review: "I couldn’t be more pleased with this expandable carry-on for our upcoming trip! The suitcase is very much like the brands Away and Monos but half the price with all of the features and attention to detail that I love. The TSA lock, the organization compartment, and the compression are all perfect! It’s lightweight and moves super smoothly in every direction. Beautiful luxe luggage at a great price!" — Colleen H.$150 at Quince2QuinceThese super-soft, quick-dry joggersMade with Quince's quick-dry, anti-microbial, stretchy Flowknit fabric, these joggers have been compared to similar pairs at Vuori, which retail for nearly double the price. These have a comfy drawstring waist and two front pockets for convenience. You can get them in men's sizes S-XXL and five colors.Promising review: "Got these for my husband - who was eyeing a similar pair at Vuori. These were a great deal and comprable quality." — Ruby T.$50 at Quince3QuinceA waffle robe made with Turkish cottonNothing says luxury like a fancy robe. If you've been eyeing one like Parachute's waffle robe, but can't stomach the price, Quince's Turkish cotton waffle robe looks similar and is a third of the price. Available in four colors and unisex sizes XS-L, the lightweight robe is made with 100% long-staple Turkish cotton that feels indulgently soft, and has two pockets, a kimono collar and a self-tie sash.$50 at QuinceAdvertisement
4QuinceThis mesh band that can dress up your Apple watchLooking to add a sophisticated touch to your Apple watch? Apple sells their Milanese loop watch band for $99, but for just $30, this mesh stainless steel option from Quince achieves a similar aesthetic. The band has a magnetic clasp for an adjustable fit and works with all models up until Apple Watch Series 10. You can grab it in three sleek colors and two band sizes.Promising review: "I bought this band as a less expensive alternative to the Apple Milanese loop. This is an incredible band! It looks amazing, the quality is great, and it’s SO comfortable. I wear it casually, to work out, on long runs, dressed up, etc. I received it about a month ago and haven’t taken it off! I love it so much I bought it for my Dad for Father's Day and he’s equally obsessed. I can’t recommend it enough!" — Daniel H.$30 at QuinceAdvertisement
5QuinceA romantic smocked midi dressHow cute is this smocked dress? It's a doppelganger of Hill House Home's popular Ellie nap dress, but is over $100 less than the Hill House dress's list price. The flowy tiered skirt and ruffly straps add a dreamy touch to a cute, comfortable silhouette. You can find this in a bunch of colors and two fabrics — poplin or eyelet — in women's sizes XS-XL.Promising review: "This looks just like Hill House but is at such an affordable price. Length was great. Dress can be dressed up or down. Perfect for work or a summer night out." — Debra C.$70 at Quince6QuinceThe perfect three-compartment tote for daily useWhether you need a new bag for the office or just for getting around town, this Italian leather tote is a simple but gorgeous option that still provides function. It has a center zipper pocket that can fit a tablet or laptop, three interior slip pockets and protective metal feet on the bottom. This looks like a lot of higher-end totes, but one of its closest matches may be the Cuyana Easy tote, which sells for $278 (and doesn't have a zipper pocket for your laptop — just saying). You can grab this in six colors.$150 at QuinceAdvertisement
7QuinceA performance polo you can dress up or downJust like the joggers we mentioned earlier, this polo is made with Quince's lightweight, moisture-wicking Flowknit fabric and compares to similar, more expensive items at Vuori. Available in seven classic colors and men's sizes S-XXL, many reviews mention using this as a shirt for golfing, but it wouldn't look out of place at brunch or on vacation or even out for a slightly dressy dinner.$35 at Quince8QuinceThis bestselling linen swing dressPerhaps one of Quince's most popular dresses, this sleeveless swing dress is a much cheaper alternative to the $178 Faherty Isha dress. Don't be fooled by the lower price, though: This dress is still made with 100% European linen for a luxurious, lightweight feel that makes it perfect for summer. There are two pockets, and the buttons down the front are actually functional, too. You can find this dress in six colors and women's sizes XS-XL.Promising review: "I bought this same dress in the white color last year--it's a light material and is just an easy dress to throw on in the summer. Comfy-not the most flattering ever but it's still cute and TTS. It wrinkles a bit, but that's linen for you. I bought this in the Blue Pinstripe and a week or two later I was at Faherty and they were selling the EXACT same dress for about $130--same quality and everything-this dress is definitely a steal!" — Chelsey$60 at Quince9QuinceA pair of cropped bootcut yoga pantsIn case you haven't heard, capris are gaining in popularity again, so these cropped bootcut leggings might catch your eye. They look pretty similar to a pair from Beyond Yoga that retails for $99, too. The leggings are moisture-wicking, have a hidden waistband pocket and are great for yoga, low-impact workouts or just running errands and hanging around the house. These pants come in six colors and women's sizes XS-XL; note that the reviews recommend sizing up for a better fit.$40 at QuinceAdvertisement
10QuinceA chic shoulder bag made of handwoven leatherThe style of Clare V handbags, like this Italian leather one with a woven checkered design, is to die for. The price tag? Not so much. Quince makes a similar-looking version in two sizes, the largest one being $130 (a far cry from Clare V's $485). The bag has a zipper closure, one interior zip pocket and two slip pockets and two straps so you can use this as a shoulder bag or messenger. This comes in four colors.Promising review: "This met… maybe exceeded my expectations. Gold hardware is nice, leather quality is good, size and style is great! I’ve seen a similar bag by Clare V and this one looks as good for a fraction of the price." — Christine Y.$110+ at Quince11QuinceThis summery cotton maxi dressThis sleeveless maxi dress wouldn't look out of place on vacation, at the beach or even at a summer wedding. It also looks similar to the Cove dress by Jenni Kayne, which will typically run you over $300. The dress comes in three colors and sizes XS-XL, and features a lightweight poplin fabric, two side seam pockets and adjustable straps.$70 at Quince12QuinceA popular linen sheet set that starts at under $100100% linen sheets for under $90 is nearly unheard of, especially with as many 5-star reviews as this Quince set has racked up. Compare this to the price of sheets at bedding giants like Brooklinen and Parachute, and you can see why they'd be so beloved.Flat sheet haters will appreciate the option to choose whether or not you want one included with your set, and the fitted sheet fits mattresses up to 16 inches. These also have an impressive color and pattern range, with over 30 options available in sizes twin-split king.Promising review: "I purchased two sets of linen sheets, and the fabric quality far exceeded my expectations. As a result, I am a captive Quince customer. I have seen sheets like this in Italy and four times the price, so honestly wasn’t expecting the fine linen I received." — Stephen L.$90+ at QuinceAdvertisement
13QuinceThese sophisticated Italian leather horsebit mulesIf you're into the classic look of a horsebit leather mule, you may have come across designer versions like the Gucci Princetown slipper, which costs an eye-watering $990. Quince sells a cheaper lookalike that's made of Italian leather and has an ortholite insole for support and padding. The shoes come in three neutral colors and women's sizes 5-11.Promising review: "These shoes are so chic! I’ve been wanting a pair of Gucci horsebit mules for a while now, but can’t convince myself to make such a large purchase. These shoes are so convincing, and comfortable! I wear a size 8.5 and went up half a size and they fit great!" — EC$70 at Quince14QuinceA tunic dress with puffy elastic sleevesThis tunic dress provides a more affordable alternative to the similar-looking Anthropologie Bettina tiered shirtdress with its relaxed fit and put-together silhouette. Made with 100% organic cotton poplin, the dress is lightweight even with its longer puff sleeves, and features side seam pockets, a functional button-down front and a tiered skirt. One reviewer vouches that the buttons go low enough for breastfeeding. You can get this in four colors and women's sizes XS-XL.Promising review: "I was looking for a summer dress that is as comfortable as pajamas, but looks more polished. This dress is perfect. It looks very similar to a dress that I almost bought for a lot more $$$. I’m so glad I tried this first. Great quality. I’m 5’3” so it’s more of a maxi length on me which I’m happy with." — Rose L.$70 at Quince15QuinceA travel-ready quilted sling bagThe sling bag is the hero of travel, and this chic puffer bag is no exception. The three pockets, water-resistant material, adjustable strap and lay-flat design make this bag ultra-functional, while its quilted design is reminiscent of a similar MZ Wallace bag that sells for $285. This bag is available in three colors.Promising review: "Since receiving sling bag I have been using it everyday. I love that it has so many compartments and is so easy to wear over the heavy coat crossbody. I have MZ Wallace as well that I love but this is so much better on the wallet and is equally wonderful. Mz has extra straps but in reality the only straps used is the same one as on this Quince sling. So I totally recommend Quince Sling and also it has no branding outside the bag that makes me feel more comfortable on a New York City subway without anyone knowing what brands I am wearing." — Victoria N.$70 at QuinceAdvertisement
16QuinceThis blazer made with Quince's signature Mongolian cashmereYou may have heard about Quince's Mongolian cashmere, as some of their bestsellers are made with the luxurious fabric. This Mongolian cashmere blazer has a water-repellant finish, is breathable and temperature-regulating, features several pockets and has a stand collar you can wear up or down. Available in three colors and men's sizes S-XXL, the blazer has drawn comparisons to a similar-looking Brunello Cucinelli jacket that costs well over $5,000.$300 at QuinceRelatedshoppingStylehomeClothingThese $17 Shapewear Shorts Are The Secret To Staying ‘Cool And Comfy’
