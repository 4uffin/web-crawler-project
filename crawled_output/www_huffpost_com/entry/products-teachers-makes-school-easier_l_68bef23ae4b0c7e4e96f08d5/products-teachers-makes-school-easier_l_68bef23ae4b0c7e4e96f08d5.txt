After debating this purchase for a long time, I finally made the jump. It allows me to staple 20‚Äì30 pages instantly. No more picking up a stapler, setting it down, picking it back up, misplacing it, dropping it, and everything in between ‚Äî this has made my classroom management even better than it already was (and I‚Äôm a great manager of space and time).Having the extra time to eat my lunch, order groceries online, and text my husband when it‚Äôs food-consumption time makes this product a huge win for me. I already have two teachers who bring their items to my classroom each morning to staple their printouts for the day. It really does save that much time. If it ever breaks, I‚Äôll buy it again (assuming it‚Äôs out of warranty)." ‚Äî CajunDragonGet it from Amazon for $482amazon.comA label maker to make organizing your classroom that much more satisfyingPromising review: "I‚Äôm a preschool teacher, and I use this for plenty of things in my room: homework folders, napping beds, you name it! It‚Äôs easy to peel on and off, and the app is simple to use. You can also order new rolls with different designs for a decent price. I think it‚Äôs worth it!" ‚Äî Amazon CustomerGet it from Amazon for $19 (available in three colors).3TargetOr a Cricut Joy bundleMake sure to check out Cricut's US teacher discount to get additional materials for less!Promising review: "This compact little powerhouse is an amazing asset in the classroom! I use it to label, organize, and even beautify the various items in my room. It‚Äôs definitely a must-have if you‚Äôre an avid teacher-decorator! Compact enough to store out of sight, yet powerful enough to cut (and even write) whatever you want. Highly recommend!" ‚Äî CaitlinGet it from Cricut for $139 (originally $232).Advertisement
4amazon.comA self-sharpening paper trimmer that can cut up to 15 sheets at a timePromising reviews: "So useful as a teacher. Works just like I needed it to. Very pleased!" ‚Äî sara"This was perfect for helping my sister cut stuff for her classroom. She didn‚Äôt have time to go to the staff room and use the school's paper cutter so we got her her own!" ‚Äî Mykenna HadlGet it from Amazon for $64+.Advertisement
5amazon.comA folding utility cart that doubles as your mobile command centerPromising review: "I wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect with this cart, but I‚Äôm honestly so impressed. It‚Äôs super lightweight, yet holds more than I thought it would. I‚Äôve used it for everything: grocery runs, hauling supplies to work, carrying books and materials as a teacher, even as a rolling bin for weekend travel. It‚Äôs been a total game-changer.The fact that it folds up flat is a HUGE plus. It doesn‚Äôt take up much space in my trunk or closet, and unfolding it literally takes seconds. The handle extends smoothly, and the rotating wheels make it super easy to maneuver, even when it‚Äôs full. I‚Äôve pulled it across parking lots, sidewalks, and tile floors without any issues.The lid is also a nice touch. I‚Äôve used it to keep things dry in light rain, and sometimes I even use it as a little makeshift seat while waiting. It‚Äôs surprisingly sturdy and has held up well under weight.The green color is fun and easy to spot in a crowd. I‚Äôve already gotten a few 'Where did you get that?' questions.If you're on the go a lot, this cart is a lifesaver. Whether you're a teacher, traveler, or just someone who‚Äôs tired of juggling too many bags, this thing is worth it." ‚Äî Stephy VirgosGet it from Amazon for $67.6amazon.comA presentation clicker, so you can teach without being glued to your laptopPromising review: "This remote has been a total game changer for my classroom! I use it with my TV and Smartboard, and it works flawlessly with my Google Slides presentations. It‚Äôs responsive, easy to set up, and saves me from constantly running back to my computer during lessons.The built-in laser pointer is a great bonus. It helps me highlight key points without blocking the screen or losing students' attention. It‚Äôs small, lightweight, and fits perfectly in my hand. Highly recommend for any teacher looking to level up their classroom presentations!" ‚Äî MeganGet it from Amazon for $10.Advertisement
7amazon.comAn all-in-one printer, so you aren't stuck relying on the school‚Äôs ancient onePromising review: "When I made the decision to return to teaching, I knew I would need a printer. The one I had was going through ink so fast and a friend of mine suggested this one. I love that it came with ink, and it was easy to set up and install the app on my phone. I print a lot for my classroom and in color. I have only had to replace the ink once versus my other printer I was replacing the ink monthly. All the images in color and black and white come out clearly. It has a high capacity of printing and is a great product for the price. I would highly recommend this product, especially if you are a teacher or print a lot." ‚Äî Miriam G. TorresGet it from Amazon for $235.8amazon.comA smart mugPromising review: "So glad I found this little gem. The auto on/off feature is this product‚Äôs most valuable asset, and I‚Äôm especially impressed with how it keeps my tea at the perfect drinking temperature. As a tea drinker and a teacher, I often have cups go cold while I‚Äôm busy instructing or working with students. I‚Äôd never invested in a cup warmer for my classroom before because I worried I might accidentally leave it on at the end of the school day. This warmer only turns on when the weight of your cup is on the surface ‚Äî perfect for busy people who still want to enjoy a warm beverage without the worry." ‚Äî joneshoganGet it from Amazon for $129.9amazon.comA thermal laminatorPromising review: "Four years ago, my teacher colleague and I both purchased laminators for regular classroom use. She bought this one, while I chose an alternative product, thinking some of its added features would be useful. After dealing with inconsistent heating, repeated jams, and not using any of the extra features I thought I would, my off-brand laminator died.My colleague is still using her original Scotch brand laminator, and I recently purchased this one as a replacement. I‚Äôm very happy with its simplicity, small size, and reliable performance so far. I should have bought this product a long time ago! It fits nicely in a drawer in my classroom and heats up quickly when I need it. The Amazon brand laminating sheets work well with it, too. I‚Äôm very happy with this laminator. Truly, I should have bought it years ago!" ‚Äî DustGet it from Amazon for $40.Advertisement
10amazon.comAn EZ Grader chart because it lets you figure out each kid‚Äôs grade in 0.3 secondsPromising reviews: "Couldn‚Äôt live without this in my classroom! Super easy to use and still in perfect condition after a year!" ‚Äî Hannah"I've used one of these on and off for 27 years in the classroom. It makes grading papers so much faster than calculating scores. My student teacher loves using it so I bought her her own." ‚Äî kathryn jacobsGet it from Amazon for $13.11amazon.comA 120-pack of fidget toys you can use to stock your treasure chest of rewardsPromising review: "If you are a teacher of any kind, this is an easy and effortless way to incentive your classes. It is great for a large age range of kids." ‚Äî Jacq Hammer"I‚Äôm a special education teacher, and I give out fidgets and calming tools daily! This was a great pack with a variety of choices without a bunch of small, junky ones!" ‚Äî Rayann TurnerGet it from Amazon for $17.12amazon.comA 1000-pack of hook-and-loop dotsPromising review: "I use these Velcro dots all the time! I‚Äôve been a teacher for three years, and I make centers for my special education class using them. I‚Äôve reordered them several times. They stick great ‚Äî removable, but not too easily ‚Äî and my students have never pulled any off. They make life so much easier!" ‚Äî April HernandezGet it from Amazon for $7.Advertisement
13amazon.comA 24-pocket expanding file folder to make sense of the overwhelming amount of papersPromising review: "I could give this thing a 10! I have 610 students for Spanish class and was skeptical about finding something that could hold participation calendars for 24 different classes, but this works WONDERFULLY. With this many papers, it stands up well, though don‚Äôt expect it to fully close (which is a feature I don‚Äôt even need).If you have fewer papers to file, it still works great, but it won‚Äôt stand upright unless there‚Äôs enough weight inside. The accordion style is exactly what I was hoping for.A+ for durability, storage, and ease of use! üëçüèº" ‚Äî Amazon CustomerGet it from Amazon for $13.14amazon.comA 36-pack of dry erase boards, each of which comes with its own marker and eraserPromising review: "These are an absolute win for anyone needing a practical, durable, and convenient solution for interactive learning or group activities. I use them in a classroom setting, and they‚Äôve been a fantastic addition!What Makes Them Great:Double-Sided Versatility: The boards are double-sided, offering plenty of space for students or participants to write, draw, and brainstorm. It‚Äôs like having two boards in one! Generous Pack Size: With 26 boards and matching erasers included, this set is ideal for classrooms, tutoring sessions, or team-building exercises ‚Äî no one is left out! Perfect Size: At 12.5 x 9 inches, the boards are large enough to write comfortably but compact enough to be portable and easy to store. Durable and Sturdy: The boards hold up well to regular use. The surface wipes clean easily, leaving no ghosting or residue behind. Convenient Erasers Included: Each board comes with its own eraser, which is a thoughtful and practical touch. The erasers are the perfect size for small hands but work just as well for adults. These lapboards make teaching more interactive and fun while keeping cleanup quick and easy. They‚Äôre also a hit for homeschooling, small group discussions, or even family game nights. Highly recommend for anyone looking for an affordable, high-quality solution for learning and creativity!" ‚Äî Papa DunnGet it from Amazon for $49.15amazon.comA 360-pack of mechanical pencilsPromising review: "As a teacher, I am constantly using and lending out pencils. These work well and were a good price. I highly recommend." ‚Äî N KelGet it from Amazon for $40.Advertisement
16amazon.comA work apron you'll especially appreciate during art projectsPromising review: "We purchased these aprons to use for our STEAM Enrichment Program Lab. Teachers are woodworking, exploding pumpkins, and doing messy art projects weekly. With these amazing aprons, they have been covered and clean! We actually would love a shorter smaller style for all of our students as well!" ‚Äî Lab 11235Get it from Amazon for $34.17amazon.comA 410-pack of sticky notes in all kinds of colors, shapes, and sizesPromising review: "This product has been extremely helpful in keeping me organized during my first week back at school! The notes stick extremely well, and everything stays neatly arranged in the hard-shell case. This is exactly what I needed to get my year off to a great start!" ‚Äî Celeste ArrowoodGet it from Amazon for $7.18amazon.comA cordless hot glue gunPromising review: "This is the best hot glue gun for teachers because you can have it plugged in on your desk and use it anywhere in the room." ‚Äî KoalatfriendGet it from Amazon for $19.Advertisement
19amazon.comA 30-pack of dry erase pocket sleevesPromising review: "Love these! My students use them daily. I‚Äôve created math mats with different types of math aids, and my students keep all of their math mats inside to work out their problems. I also use them in my centers. Students do their work on the mats, take a picture of their completed work, send it to me in Seesaw, and then wipe them clean for the next student. Saves on copies!" ‚Äî Andrea HoreczkoGet it from Amazon for $18.Reviews for this post have been edited for length and/or clarity.
