It makes my face look so hydrated and it feels so refreshing. I even spray it in with make up on. I will most definitely buy this product again!” — Cristy“I’ve tried all the viral toners and this one is by far superior- it costs more but worth it!!! I am over 40 with combination skin, so I’m picky. It’s the only one that keeps my skin plump throughout the day and I always wind up returing the trendy toners and coming back to Beekman 1802.” — MoeMoe“Does exactly what I needed it to! As I’m getting older, my usual make up routine was making my skin look drier and my make up look more caked on. I wanted something that would add a glowy finish and make my skin look more hydrated. This is perfect! It also helps my make up look better longer. I definitrly recommend this. I have sensitive skin and this hasn’t caused any unpleasant reactions.” — Globnar Check out more 50% off deals from Ulta’s 21 Days of Beauty, but act fast because they’re only on sale today.UltaThe Beekman 1802 Milk Shake moisture mist to keep your body glowing, soft and smelling greatPromising review: "I think this product is so unique and lovely! I love this more than traditional moisturizers that leave my skin oily and sticky. There's nothing worse than trying to put your clothes on after you've moisturizer your body, but that's not the case with this!! Just shake it up and spray on clean damp or dry skin! I love the lavender scent as well! Great product and easy to use! Gifted by beekman1802, and I love it!" — Amanda$24.50 at Ulta (regularly $49)UltaOuidad's frizz-fighting hydrating maskPromising review: "I'm always looking for hair products that can take on southern humidity and this one does just that while adding a softness to my hair. Best hair mask I've tried. For reference, I have thick course blonde hair that can become dry. Please don't stop making this product!" — Heather$22 at Ulta (regularly $44)UltaA 5-pack of Patchology's Serve Chilled On Ice under eye gel patchesPromising review: "These are probably my favorite eye gels from Patchology. They are so soothing and cooling. I love using them first thing in the morning to calm puffiness under my eyes. I love that you can see the effect in as little as 5 minutes. Perfect for a busy morning, although I always try to leave them on as long as possible. My hack is to wear them while I am blow drying my hair. They never slip when I am moving around, which is a huge plus!" — Lauren$8.50 at Ulta (regularly $17)Advertisement
UltaDonna Karan's Cashmere Mist eau de ToilettePromising review: "I was looking for a fragrance to send my mom and this is perfect. I sprayed on myself and it has an initial powdery note that fades to a soft and warm clean almost soap like smell. It's really lovely and I think would work great for my mom who likes to layer perfumed lotions and body wash. It's not a scent that enters the room before you or really lingers after- but more subtle and warm like you'd get a whiff when you hug. The staying power from my tester spray was pretty good too! I hope my mom enjoys it!" — Em$48 at Ulta (regularly $96)UltaMoon's platinum dissolving whitening stripsPromising review: "my teeth are very sensitive and i can never use whitening strips. i told myself i would suck it up so i could have white teeth for vacation. im on day four (8 uses) and my teeth are so white without any sensitivity. i did waste about 3 strips while learning to get them to stick but i definitely will buy again if i need my teeth whitened!" — kate$24.99 at Ulta (regularly $49.99)The Real Deal: We use deal trackers and commerce experience to sift through “fake” hike-and-drop deals and other deceptive sales tactics.
