Before I started wearing these, I had to choose cute shoes that HURT or ugly shoes that donâ€™t make my feet hurt AS bad. Because I am a 26 year old, I let myself wear the cute shoes and suffer more than Iâ€™d like to admit. These shoes have quickly become my most worn because they are cute AND I have NO pain when I get home. Before I would get home and stay on my feet until I was ready to rest for the evening because of how much it hurt to get moving again.
