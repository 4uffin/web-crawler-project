1AmazonA migraine and headache relief cap that nearly covers your whole faceIf you deal with migraines, you're probably no stranger to the feeling of wanting to shut out the whole world — and this relief cap aims to do just that. The funky-looking mask is designed to wrap around your entire head and is made with cooling gel that can help relieve headaches and improve sleep quality. You can refrigerate it for one to two hours to use it as a cold compress, or nuke it in the microwave for 30 seconds to use as a hot compress.Promising review: "Put it in the freezer and then put it on.

Does not have a smell." — ApeS$10 at Amazon2AmazonA colorful nightlight for your toilet bowlIf you often have to get up in the middle of the night to use the toilet but don't want to turn all the lights on, this colorful, motion-activated Toilight is here to help.

Reviewers say the light is dim enough that you can easily go back to sleep afterward.Promising review: "Listen friends, we all get up and stumble to the bathroom in the middle of the night. Some guided by the light of a cellphone, others boldly blasting themselves with the light of a thousands sun's. Some so perfect, they don't need roads. I mean lights.Anyways, this baby is the solution to all your nighttime potty problems! Its calm, soft, light, only triggered by motion, will allow you to do your business in serene peace, and fall back in a quiet slumber.Get one for yourself, and for everyone you know. It's the gift they didn't know they needed." — Emily Fleming$10 at Amazon3AmazonAn "angry mama" microwave steam cleanerSave yourself the tedious job of cleaning your microwave by getting an "angry mama" to do it for you. These funny-looking steam cleaners can be filled up with vinegar, water and lemon juice, and then microwaved for seven minutes. The steam released from the head will soften dirt and stains, cutting down on cleaning time and the amount of elbow grease you'll have to expend.Promising review: "This product is amazing. Fun to use the kids and adults love it. The angrier she looks the more everyone laughs. Leaves my microwave super clean after a simple wipe down. I especially love that I don't have to use any chemicals. My sister loved it so much that she took my second one lol." — Carisa R.2-pack: $10 at AmazonAdvertisement
4AmazonThese dice that can end arguments about what to eat or doIf you and your partner or family can't decide what to order or make for dinner — or how to spend your nights or weekends — just roll the dice (literally). You can buy a food-themed, night-themed, or weekend-themed die with different suggestions etched into each side to add variety to your dinners or plans and head off any disagreements.Promising review: "Sometimes, you know you want to go out for dinner, but you don't know where you want to go. So you and your significant other try to come up with ideas, but nothing quite sounds right. So, you roll this die and save yourself a lot of tiresome pondering.There are times when it doesn't actually matter what is decided, it only matters that a decision is made at all. When that is the case (and the decision is what you are going to eat), this die is there to make your life easier." — Alex$9 at AmazonAdvertisement
5AmazonA 2-pack of deodorizer inserts for your smelly shoesShoes stinking up your gym bag? That's no longer a problem with these deodorizer inserts, which absorb odor without leaving a smell of their own behind. All you have to do is slide the inserts into your favorite pair of shoes that doesn't smell so great anymore, and the inserts will take care of the rest. Just make sure to "recharge" them by letting them sit in direct sunlight once a month, and they should be reusable for up to two years.Promising review: "These really work for my Smelly Shoe Syndrome. They actually absorb the odor instead of masking it with a weird fruity smell the way sneaker balls do. Can't recommend these enough." — Emily Smith$10 at Amazon6AmazonA collagen mask for your buttReviewers say this butt sheet mask pack of two (one for each cheek) has helped with acne and the appearance of cellulite. The masks contain caffeine, collagen, aloe leaf juice and more, and are meant to retexturize and hydrate the skin. They're also unscented, vegan and cruelty-free.$10 at AmazonAdvertisement
7AmazonThis yellow goop that gets rid of dust on keyboards, car vents and moreDusting is made easier — and more fun — with this reusable yellow goo that you can stick and unstick to keyboards, calculators, car vents, TVs, air conditioners and more. The gel has a lemon fragrance and won't stick to your hands, but will collect the dust with its strong adhesion, turning a boring chore into an activity more reminiscent of playing with slime.Promising review: "Looked super cool in the photos and figured I would give it a try. Air dusters work for big dust clumps but I needed something better that isn't loud such as a can of compressed air. This stuff immediately started working the second I set it on the keyboard. I was done in about 30-45 seconds then put it back in the container. One of the smarter purchases I have made in a while. Girlfriend thought I was weird for buying what looks like Gak (90's kids you know what I mean) but this stuff just works." — Kenny$6 at Amazon8AmazonA deodorizer for your fridge to get rid of bad odorsIf you can't get rid of a funky smell in your fridge, no matter what you do, you may want to try a deodorizer like this one.

My dtr bought a house and the fridge had an overwhelming odor of sauerkraut. Distinct, pungent. I was wondering if she was going to need a new fridge it was that bad.Along comes this amazing little device which has been a total game-changer. She placed it in and I went to visit 3 days later, no sign of the odor AT ALL. Absolutely amazing! 50-star recommendation!" — GrnEyesAmyZ$22 at Amazon9Amazon, AmazonAn adorable garlic crusher that looks like DraculaGarlic is a good addition to nearly any meal, but mincing it can be a chore. This friendly little vampire can get the job done fast without making your hands smell like garlic: Just open the top, add the cloves in and twist the top and bottom parts in opposite directions to press, crush and mince. Best of all, you don't only have to use this ergonomic grinder for garlic; it can also work with ginger, herbs and other spices.Promising review: "Bought this on a whim when I was browsing one day. We use a LOT of garlic in our house. I cheat and use the chopped kind in the jar in a pinch. But let's be honest, it ain't the same. For full delightful effect ya gotta use fresh. And anything that makes that easy is gold in my book. Well-designed, a snap to clean, and takes up very little space. Come to think of it, this is so darn cute I think I might keep it out. At the end of a hard workday, everyone could use something that makes them smile while prepping dinner! Now I can :-)" — amazon mamma of two$10 at AmazonAdvertisement

Best of all, this is so cute it doubles as decor.Promising review: "I’m absolutely in love with the LuoCoCo Egg Separator! Not only is it the cutest kitchen gadget I’ve ever owned, but it’s also incredibly functional. Separating egg whites has always been a bit tricky and messy for me, but this little guy makes it so easy and fun. The yolks stay perfectly inside while the whites pour out smoothly—no more broken yolks!!The design is so charming that it makes me smile every time I use it, and the quality of the ceramic feels sturdy and durable. Plus, it’s dishwasher safe, which is a huge bonus for easy clean-up.If you love cooking or baking, or even if you just appreciate cute and clever kitchen tools, this egg separator is a must-have. It’s not just practical; it adds a bit of joy to your kitchen routine. Highly recommend—trust me, you’ll wonder how you ever lived without it!" — Keeper Of My Castle$8 at Amazon11AmazonThese silly but practical cowboy hat straw coversIf your reusable water bottle has a straw that doesn't close on its own, a straw cover like these cute cowboy hats can help prevent spills or keep your drink safe from dirt, dust or bugs. This four-pack includes four colors (black, white, pink and brown) and the covers are BPA-free and dishwasher-safe. Yeehaw!Promising review: "These are great for school work any public setting to keep people from drinking something that isn’t theirs! I am a big germ person and this gives me way more peace of mind at work that no one is accidentally drinking my cup and idk about yall but bugs scare me outside ! I love knowing nothing at all is getting in my cup through the straw while I’m doing activities! And to add THESE ARE SOOO CUTE , great product over all." — Chloe A$6 at Amazon12AmazonA warm eye compress you can activate in your microwaveDealing with dry eyes?

I heat for 25 seconds and leave on for a minimum of 10 minutes and it helps with my dry eyes." — Amazon Customer$16 at AmazonAdvertisement
13AmazonA cactus toilet plunger and brush setA toilet plunger and brush can take away some of the aesthetic charm of a bathroom, but they don't have to: Enter this cactus plunger and brush set, which act both as decor and as cleaning tools. Stored in the same two-compartment holder, the plunger has a commercial-grade rubber suction cup, and the strong bristles on the brush can assist in cleaning tough stains. .Promising review: "Are these more expensive than a normal plunger and toilet brush set? Yes. Are they worth it? YES!These are really cute in my bathroom and it adds a lot of fun and character to both the bathroom and to your mundane toiletry tools. The handles (green stems) are made of plastic and have a slightly ribbed texture and actually have some weight to it - they aren't light. The toilet brush head can twist off and is replaceable. Aesthetic and functionality are two thumbs up!" — Nate$26 at Amazon14AmazonA nose wax kit reviewers say is weird, but worksGross but effective, this nose wax kit comes with 100 grams of wax beads, 10 mustache protectors, 30 applicators, 10 paper cups and a measuring cup. Using the kit can help you remove pesky nasal hairs at the root, ensuring you don't have to trim them as often (the brand says results should last four to six weeks).Promising review: "So easy to use! I did the pour hot water in cup and warm beads method. Kind of like melting chocolate. Well it was ready to pull in two minutes. The wax won’t be super hard but it was cooled completely so I knew it held the hairs right. Then straight down in one strong tug. Pinch the nose above to make it almost painless. I didn’t feel much but you can hear it rip from your skin and that is weird. You’ll basically freak yourself out the first time till it’s happens and then think it’s not a big deal. The bad videos online are because they shove it all the way up with too much wax." — Izzy$17 at Amazon15AmazonA fun soup ladle shaped like the Loch Ness monsterBring a bit of fun to your soup pot with this Nessie ladle that has four little feet it can stand on and has earned over 7,000 5-star ratings. The ladle comes in three sizes and two colors. It's also dishwasher-safe, BPA-free and heat-resistant. Nessie is an easy and functional way to add some color and whimsy to your kitchen, and seeing her head sticking out of the pot has made many reviewers laugh. It's plenty cute, but Nessie's height also prevents the annoyance of a too-short spoon falling into the food you're cooking.Promising review: "Nessie the ladle is just one of those things you've gotta have in your kitchen. Besides putting a smile on your face every time you see her, she's quite the conversation starter too. When I first looked at her up close, I wondered - Is this really going to work? She seemed ...well ... short (or at least shorter than I expected). Then I put her in a pot - and she sits there, staring at me, like she owns the place! This was a pure fun purchase that I won't regret. Bet you won't either :) Highly recommended." — Dawn L.$20 at AmazonAdvertisement
16AmazonAn antiperspirant hand lotion for the sweaty palms clubYou've heard of lotion to moisturize your hands, but what about lotion to keep them dry? This antiperspirant hand lotion is a great invention for anyone who suffers from constant sweaty palms. It's non-greasy, quick-drying, scented like eucalyptus and only requires a pea-sized amount to keep your hands nice and dry.Promising review: "My hands sweat like crazy when I play Pickleball. I have used all sorts of over grips and none of them solved my problem. I tried this and my hands actually stay dry. Just a little dab on you hands before you play is all you need to do. Rub it in and let it dry and you are good to go. Best product I have ever used. While it seems expensive for a small tube, because you use so little it is really a great value. Several friends have tried it as well and all love it." — Kirbinster (Howard)$20 at Amazon17AmazonThese dip clips to hold your sauces while you driveIf you take frequent road trips, you might know the perils of trying to eat in the car without making a mess.
