The glaze is so pretty and the design so cute. You can tell up close that it is handmade with love and not mass produced. Exactly the unique gift I was looking for, and yes, it does amplify and direct the sound well. :) I love it! ‚Äî undergawdThis fun piece is made by ceramic artist JoAnn Stratakos, who designs and crafts unique glazes in her studio in the Pocono Mountains!$55 at Uncommon Goods2AmazonA set of mushroom glass vases that'll help you live out your fairy garden dreamsPromising review: "I originally bought these as bud vases for my daughter‚Äôs garden tea grad party, and they were so precious! I loved them so much, I decided to use them to dress up the window in my home office. They add a perfect little pop of color! They arrived packaged well, in mint condition, and on time. They are very thin and lightweight, so they should be handled and stored carefully." ‚Äî Just Jess!$30 at Amazon3Amazon, www.amazon.comA pair of retro-style smiley face slippers to bring some much-needed joyNote: if you're on the higher end of a size range, reviewers recommend sizing up.Promising reviews: "This slipper was a godsend for my feet. I was a little skeptical at first since I wasn't sure if I could stand in them for long with my Plantar Fasciitis, but I was able to stand on them for several hours with comfort! Love the design of the smiley face, which helps brighten my day when I look down :) This slipper is soft on your skin, but the sole is nice and sturdy without being uncomfortable. Would definitely gift it to a friend!" ‚Äî Monica L."As someone who has WIDE feet, I definitely recommend these slippers. This is my second time buying from them, they're amazing! They're thick on the bottom and cozy, just perfect! And they will last you for a while if you use them around the house only! Therefore 10/10!!!ü™©" ‚Äî Kimberly$18 at AmazonAdvertisement
4AmazonA TonyMoly Jelly Lip Melt in a Jell-O mold-inspired containerPromising review: "If you like the Laneige lip sleeping mask, then get this. In my opinion, this lip melt works even better and stays on my lips way longer! Whenever I used the Laneige mask before bed, I would always wake up feeling like it had all rubbed off, and my lips would feel a little dry, but also kinda sticky somehow. With this lip melt, I wake up still feeling like I have the product on my lips, and they feel smooth and hydrated. I also prefer the texture of this lip melt more, and a little product also goes a long way." ‚Äî Caimish$12 at AmazonAdvertisement
5www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comA handheld duck vacuumThe duck vacuum is wire free and comes with a USB charging cable, as well as a storage bag and three attachments: a crevice tool, a brush nozzle, and a bendable tube.Promising review: "Just a fantastic item. Picks up really quickly all that tiny, small stuff that falls off your counters. Has a strong little motor and works really well. I compared my Dust Buster to the Duck, and to be honest, both did pretty much the same, except the Duck, being narrower, is able to get into the tighter areas better. Also, being smaller than the Dust Buster, I can just place the Duck in a drawer. Works exceptionally good when it comes to getting in between the car seats and furniture cushions. It's just a great little convenient tool to have around your home. ‚Äî jackie$50 at Amazon6www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comA vintage wall sconce that'll add a subtle pop of fun to your wallsThe battery-operated version can produce three color temperatures, and it even has a timer!Promising review: "So beautiful and so happy I found this sconce! I have it hanging above a picture. The light is not overly bright, more like a night-light. But that‚Äôs exactly what I wanted it for, more decorative. So many compliments on it. Simply beautiful, wireless, and easy to hang up." ‚Äî Mac$45 at AmazonAdvertisement
7AvOKado Ceramic / EtsyA mini passionfruit dish to bring a bit of tropical lounging-by-the-beach energyThe seller offers other fruity designs, like blueberries or a strawberry ‚Äî and for the most whimsical of us all, a set of cheese plates!Promising review: "This is a beautiful piece ‚Äî bright, colorful, and a very interesting addition to my other serving dishes.

Purchased this as a gift (as part of a gift basket of conservas) and it fit perfectly." ‚Äî Amazon Customer"This bag is adorable! Every time I take it out of my bag, someone compliments it. Bag is small enough for a handbag and the right size to carry everyday essentials" ‚Äî PC$18 at Amazon9AmazonA Mjolnir meat tenderizer that'll transform you into a cooking heroThe Marvel store makes other fun kitchen gadgets, like a Captain America shield cutting board!Promising review: "Love this tenderizer. It would be great just as Marvel memorabilia, but I use mine as an actual meat tenderizer. Works great. The handle has been sturdy so far. The head is very heavy, so I could see where if you‚Äôre not using a controlled firm grip, you could wind up breaking the handle, but if you handle it properly, you should be okay. The strap around the handle is made of a rubber material. Washes and wipes clean easily. Probably wouldn‚Äôt put it in the dishwasher. Tenderize your meat inside a ziplock bag, and you should be able to keep it pretty clean. Which means less wear and tear with washing it." ‚Äî Daniel T$26 at AmazonAdvertisement
10Ototo, OtotoA croc-shaped food chopper whose sharp, mighty jaw can chomp through just about anythingCheck out a TikTok of the Croc Chop in action! And yes, you saw that right, it comes with different attachments including a ribbon blade so you can make that viral sliced cucumber salad. Promising review: "I love this thing. Not only is it adorable, but it saves me so much time chopping vegetables. You still have to clean out the seeds (if it has any) and slice the veggies before use, but when I'm doing a stir fry or something similar, this easily cuts prep time in HALF, if not more. Be aware, the blades on this thing are SHARP. Just heed the warning to handle the bladed parts CAREFULLY!" ‚Äî Kayli$30 at Amazon11Wax & Wix Bakery / EtsyA banana pudding candle if you've always wanted your home to smell like summer picnics pThe candle is 13 ounces with a burn time of about 90 hours, and the specific notes are ripe bananas, vanilla pudding, hints of caramelized sugar, and buttery undertones. The seller also has tons of other dessert-inspired waxy creations, like a blueberry waffle skillet or these strawberry shortcake melts.Promising review: "I‚Äôm always worried about ordering candles as gifts because you obviously can‚Äôt smell them lol. But this one does truly smell like a banana pudding, and it‚Äôs not overwhelming." ‚Äî ThrowablesWax & Wix Bakery is a family-owned small biz based in Pennsylvania. All their scents are custom-blended in-house and molded from fresh foods for accurate texture and design!$29 at Etsy12AmazonA set of dachshund-shaped paperclips that'll add a little bit of fun to your stacks of documentsThe company has lots of other paperclip designs, like these cute dolphins, silly feet, and even letters!

Promising review: "Love having this on my kitchen sink. It‚Äôs happy and cute and makes me happy. One leaf did twist off after a few weeks of use but it‚Äôs still cute and I could‚Äôve been more careful holding it. Not a super stiff brush but works well for most hand washing and quick rinses. Brush rinses well and food doesn‚Äôt get caught in it. I was happy to find it has a hidden scraper edge on top of the brush. Will def buy again when this one gets gross since it brings so much tiny joy into my kitchen." ‚Äî Hannah Jo Wilson$14 at Amazon14Little Dorky Designs / Etsy, Little Dorky Designs / EtsyA bouquet of Venus flytrap bag clipsBy default, the flytrap will be olive green with a red mouth and brown base, but the color can be customized ‚Äî just include a note at checkout or message the seller after purchasing.

She's developing arthritis and this elevated dish is the perfect height for her size to let her stand or sit to eat. It's also shallow enough to not irritate her whiskers. I can already see her moving less stiffly after her meals since switching to this one. It's also heavy enough that if she's a little "wobbly" that day it won't tip over. If course, it's also adorable. The only negative thing I can say is I am annoyed I did not find and get this earlier." ‚Äî Invalid$21 at AmazonAdvertisement
16www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comA vampire umbrellaPromising review: "I was shopping for a Wednesday-ish umbrella. Came across this one and had to get it. It‚Äôs adorable. The vampire all wrapped up in his cloak and when you open it‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs freaking bats!!! I love it. I, myself, am dark and mysterious. I love all things black, love all things spooky, and all things halloweeny.. this was the best impulse buy ever. It‚Äôs not golf-umbrella-huge or little-kid-umbrella-small. It covers you enough that you don‚Äôt get splash back from the rain drops. Unless it is raining sideways, it will cover you. The undo part of it when you get done with it is great too. Just push a button and it comes down. No more pinching your fingers or breaking your thumb nail trying to make it come down. Get this one, it‚Äôs so worth it!" ‚Äî Laura$25 at Amazon17www.amazon.comA pack of climber-shaped hooksUmbra sells other functional pieces with their iconic Buddy design, like a paper towel holder and a chess set!Promising review: "They were perfect for organizing all the backpacks I have for my kids, the instructions were super helpful and made life sooo easy. I am horrible at using anchors and hanging stuff firmly to drywall, so it helped so much. They had the actual size on the paper, and all you had to do was level where you wanted them and grab a pencil and poke a hole through the paper. I ordered three sets. Each sets comes with 3 :) going to buy more for my room. But more neutral colors. Loved them and they are sturdy if you hang them correctly." ‚Äî Jacqueline Willford$25 at Amazon18www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comAn animal-shaped glasses holderPro-tip: one reviewer suggests putting sticky tack at the bottom to avoid any tipping if it's in a busy area. Promising review: "If you're like me and asked yourself if you needed this....yes, you absolutely do I have this in my office and it's so simple and brings me so much joy. I love elephants, it's a good size, it's made well, and it fits my glasses perfectly. Would recommend for the weirdo in your life." ‚Äî Amazon Customer$10 at AmazonAdvertisement
19www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comA mini bookshelf stress toy for a way to help relieve anxietyPromising review: "I didn't know what to expect from this super adorable anxiety bookshelf, but it delivered! I shake it up when I feel anxiety, even frustration, and I sort all the little books back onto the shelves anyway I want, and it is sooo satisfying! The bookshelf is super cute and well-built. It is sturdy and beautiful. The tiny books are detailed, and their covers are amazing. They aren't actual books, but they really look like they are. This is the most gratifying gift I have ever purchased for myself. Beyond satisfied!" ‚Äî Elda M. Ferguson$27 at Amazon20AmazonA pack of limited-edition floral Band-AidsPromising review: "If you‚Äôre looking for a cute Band-Aid that has flexible fabric, these are it! I only use flexible fabric band-aids because they‚Äôre way more comfortable and stay on better. Bonus that these are a cute design!" ‚Äî Jessica$4 at Amazon21www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comA set of rainbow bath bombs that make a gorgeous swirling design in your waterPromising review: "Adorable packaging. Love that they are not overly scented or have an artificial chemical smell like many bath bombs do. One of my children has extremely sensitive skin and allergies to certain fragrances and this has been the only bath bomb brand I've purchased off of Amazon that has not caused any negative reactions. It also does make a rainbow trail. Although, very short lived. It also turns the water blackish-purple, no matter which color you choose. Overall it is adorable and does its purpose while it lasts." ‚Äî TINZ.FAM$9 at AmazonAdvertisement
