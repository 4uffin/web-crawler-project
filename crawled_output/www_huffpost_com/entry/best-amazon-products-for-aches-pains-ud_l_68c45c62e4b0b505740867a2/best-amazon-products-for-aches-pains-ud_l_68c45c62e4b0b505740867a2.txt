1AmazonA penetrative concentrate creamThe Penetrex recovery cream is possibly one of the most impressively reviewed pain-relief topicals on Amazon that features a concentrated blend of natural ingredients. It's a non-greasy and sensitive skin-friendly formula containing arnica and vitamin B6 to soothe sore and achy muscles without the burning or freezing sensation of other numbing creams.Promising review: "Penetrex works for me. I have tried many different pain relieving creams and really believed a topical cream could not eliminate pain. Some products have a lot of Menthol that distracts from the pain for a while. I broke my wrist in 2015 and have 10 metal pins in my wrist. My hand, as well as my wrist, are frequently painful. I think some arthritis is developing. I am so thankful to have found Penetrex. When my hand or wrist starts hurting, I rub in a small amount of Penetrex and the pain goes away. I have not timed how long it takes. I just know if I want the pain to stop, I use Penetrex and not long after, I realize the pain is gone. I keep a jar at home and at work. I will not be without it, so I hope the company stays around for a very long time. Penetrex is not sticky or greasy, it rubs in completely like a hand cream or lotion. It has a mild fragrance, not a strong odor like some sports creams. I was introduced to electrode therapy and ultrasound during my physical therapy sessions for my wrist. I purchased both for home use. Penetrex works better than either of those therapies. I recommend you try it. It may not work the same for everyone and every type of pain, but it is worth a try." — Rita Berry$17 at Amazon2Medi-DyneA compressive arch support X brace for heel painWhether your heel pain stems from plantar fasciitis, poor shoe support, over-pronation or other foot conditions, this stretchy compressive brace is meant to provide immediate pain relief by creating targeted arch support. It's a unique design that's helped reviewers with chronic foot pain after other conventional market options had failed. It can be worn with or without shoes and is available in six sizes. Promising review: "Cue the Rihanna song 'where have you been all my lifeeeee'! I suffered from plantar fasciitis for years!!! I have wasted so much money on generic insole, (expensive!!!) custom insoles, physical therapy tape, laser treatments, massage, compression socks, gel heel cups, other similar foot devices similar to this one with no avail. I was beginning to lose hope and assumed I would just have to live with the pain.... then came this incredible device!!! I did gymnastics for ten years, which no doubt either caused or greatly contributed to my plantar fasciitis. I was so excited to hear that this product was developed by a gymnastics coach. They know exactly how we need to be taped in order to get the correct support.I used to fatigue very easily throughout the day without these. Now I stand at my standing desk for ~9 hours per day (I also stand on a cushy mat), but I could never have done that before this product. I am extremely grateful to the creators of this product that I can live an active pain-free life with the help of this device. If you feel like you have tried everything for your foot pain, do yourself a favor and try this one - it will be the last thing you try because IT ACTUALLY WORKS!I will never be without these, I almost feel like I need to buy some backup pairs just in case anything happens to these! I would recommend sizing up and do not sleep these." — Tim$32 at Medi-Dyne$32 at Amazon3AmazonA foam roller for targeted muscle reliefAvailable in five sizes, the Chrip foam roller is a physical therapy device designed with trigger points to break up tight muscle fibers. It's covered in a high-density foam and can withstand up to 500 pounds as you roll back and forth over the surface to help release the fascia that supports the back. If you have difficulty getting on the ground, it can also be used on the wall to provide the same kind of tension relief. Promising review: "I’ve been going to a chiropractor for over 20 years, but purchasing the Chirp Back Wheel has been a total game-changer for me. Since I started using it, my back mobility has improved dramatically, and my pain has decreased by what feels like 500%! I honestly wish I had bought this sooner.I use it every single day, and it’s the best tool I’ve found for stretching out my spine. Sometimes I even get those satisfying pops, just like at the chiropractor, which gives me instant relief. The design makes it easy and comfortable to roll out tight muscles and release tension.If you struggle with back pain or stiffness, I can’t recommend this enough. It’s hands down the greatest investment I’ve made for my health and comfort.For full transparency, I am a real customer who purchased this product, and this review is based solely on my personal experience. I am not being paid or sponsored in any way." — Jen Sipich$50 at AmazonAdvertisement
4AmazonA strategically designed leg pillow to manage hip and back painMade of soft yet dense memory foam, the Contour Legacy leg pillow is designed to adjust to the shape of the leg to help promote better alignment and eliminate pressure on the hips and lower back, especially for side sleepers. It has an ideal crescent structure that allows you to bend your knees freely in multiple sleep positions. Promising review: "Removed leg pain. I have suffered for years trying to sleep with a broken back and sore knees until I bought this incredible leg pillow which has completely revolutionized my sleep in the most wonderful way. No longer do I suffer while climbing stairs or experience enormous pain during simple walks. I fully recommend this product as a 69 year old." — Kent L.$29 at AmazonAdvertisement
5AmazonDisposable night guards that can help with jaw painThese Plackers disposable night guards can be particularly helpful for anyone who grinds their teeth at night or experiences conditions like TMJ. BPA-free and suitable to wear on the upper or lower teeth, these guards have a patented design that absorbs pressure and prevents you from grinding your teeth so you wake up with less jaw pain and facial tension. Each of these guards can be used up to three times before replacing. Promising review: "I already have a professionally made hard night guard for my upper teeth. However, I would still wake up with a sore jaw, my teeth would hurt and I broke three crowns within ten years. I would mention to my dentist that I needed a lower jaw night guests as well but they would say no.I bought these so I wear it in addition to the other night guard. They are not as secure as a professionally made one but it stays in mouth all night. I actually like that it’s spongy and easy to use right out of the package. Since wearing them, I wake up with no pain in my jaw and less tension. They are exactly what I needed." – Jwow10-pack: $15 at Amazon6AmazonA cervical traction pillow for the neck and shouldersAccording to one reviewer, this odd-shaped pillow made their shoulder pain "disappear completely" using a stretching technique called cervical traction, which involves gently creating space between the bones of the neck. The pillow is made from a dense foam and strategically follows the natural curvature of the spine to ease pain in as little as 10 minutes a day. Promising review: "So here's a backstory, I have a pinched nerve and I am an artist who uses their hands A LOT. It causes me a lot of pain in my right hand, which causes my arm to go numb at night and aches all through the night. It stems from my shoulder and for the last several days I've been in a ton of pain, unable to sleep. I bought this on a whim with the hope for some relief in my neck and shoulder. As soon as it arrived I opened it and used it for less than a minute. That 45 seconds I was on it made my shoulder pain disappear completely. I was shocked.. but so happy to finally have this relief. Let me be clear, my back and shoulder is messed up from several things.. and it hurt because of the tension I've kept when I used this product. But it was the kind of pain you would get from a deep tissue massage or something like that. I've continued use through the day, using around 1-2 minutes total. No pain, no aches, my neck feels less tense and my shoulder pain is completely gone. I will continue using it daily! Highly recommended" — Z$17 at AmazonAdvertisement
7AmazonA memory foam seat cushion for sciatica pain and moreIf frequent commuting or a stagnant lifestyle is causing you pain, this highly rated seat cushion — which has close to 90,800 5-star ratings — can help. Made from a responsive and dense memory foam, this ergonomic cushion can provide support, improve posture and address pain in the legs, hips, tailbone and back. Promising review: "BEST. THING. EVER. I work on the computer for a living sometimes going 2-3 hours without much movement (video calls). It used to be that I'd get up after a back-to-back-to-back sesh and from the middle of my back to the top of my tailbone would be a stinging and sharp pain for 10-15 seconds. I had a client recommend this to me. I don't know what voodoo or magic this thing does, but I'll get up from one of those same back-to-back-to-back sessions and won't feel a thing in my lower back. The tailbone + back support you get with this thing is tremendous.Truthfully - after 4-5 minutes you don't even really notice/feel that it's there. It's not cumbersome or odd-feeling, and it definitely isn't a distraction." — Ryan$44 at Amazon8Medi-DyneA pair of adjustable toe separators to promote alignmentDr. Gary Evans, a podiatrist and board-certified foot surgeon, previously told HuffPost that toe spacers and stretchers can alleviate bunion-related pain, swelling and inflammation by temporarily realigning toes, reducing pressure on joints and stretching the connective tendons.The Tuli's Soft Move toe stretchers promise to do all of the above, and come with reviewer claims of immediate relief. Made from soft silicone gel, this particular design is adjustable for a customizable stretch and features an ergonomic V-shape that mimics the toes. Promising review: "I had surgery on my toes a few years ago, which resulted in my right metatarsals not sitting right. They feel bunched, like there isn’t enough room in my skin for them.I put these little toe stretchers on, and for the first time in YEARS, my metatarsals sat flat. I could only handle them for 10-15 min at a first, because my muscles are sooooo tight in my feet. But the relief is immediate, and it lasts for 15 is min after I take them off. Just like all kinds of PT type things, I know it’ll take time. But finally, something to help realign that weird bunching feeling in my feet. I f***ing LOVE these." — CC$20 at Medi-Dyne$20 at Amazon9AmazonA very versatile and unique gel packThe Magic Gel pad holds a removable gel pack, which can be frozen or microwaved and worn in a variety of ways to target pain. The bulk-free gel packs use a very thick viscosity gel that manages to stay flexible, even when frozen, so it easily conforms around the contours of the body to offer the best contact and temperature relief possible. The unique gel takes as little as one and a half hours to freeze and retains cold for up to 20 minutes of pain relief, though reviewers claim that it lasts for much longer. Other reviewers appreciate the slight compression factor that this pad provides. Promising review: "Absolutely the best purchase I have made in a long time! I had hip surgery a few weeks back and have had lower back pain for years. I have often tried to tuck an ice pack behind me in my chair or tie it around my waist. This ice belt is The best! It fits perfectly and will adjust to fit most. The ice is very cold, which I love! It stays cold much longer than the 20 minutes you are supposed to leave it on…. If you have pain, do yourself a favor and buy this product! It is magical!” — nik$27 at AmazonAdvertisement
10AmazonA pair of copper-infused compression glovesThe idea behind compression gloves is that they can improve circulation, reduce swelling and restrict the build-up of excess fluid, which may cause aching and soreness in joints. These fingerless and machine-washable gloves are infused with copper the company claims will reduce inflammation, however, the evidence supporting that particular claim is limited.Promising reviews: "Life changing. I wear these gloves every night and they have helped tremendously with the pain in my hands. They do not compress too much, are very lightweight and I can even wear them when I'm typing. I'm ordering a second pair soon so I'm never without them!" — Rosa"In the past several months, I have had severe swelling in my feet, arms and knees. Because of a diagnosis of arthritis, I purchased these to help me sleep and they have completely worked. I used to wake up throughout the night in pain from my fingers and in the morning, they were extremely painful. Once I started wearing these at night, I slept through the night and my hands worked and felt great in the morning. I had tried other brands of gloves which didn't help as much and were hot to wear (I live in the south where it gets rather warm). These are thin and NOT hot to wear. I would definitely recommend trying them. I've always worn medium gloves but I had to get a Large in these. I'm sure it's because of the swelling." — CDW$25 at Amazon11AmazonHigh support orthotic inserts that help with plantar fasciitisThese highly-rated insoles use a high arch and deep heel cup to offer support and maintain correct foot positioning so that the heel is better protected from impact, a common issue with chronic foot conditions like plantar fascitis. The inserts are available in both men's and women's sizing.Promising review: "I have flat feet and have always struggled to find comfortable shoes. I often relied on thick-soled running shoes because they were the only options with enough arch support to make extended standing and walking bearable. For the first time, a pair of shoes I really liked had worn-out insoles, so I needed replacements. I found these highly rated on Amazon and decided to give them a try. Using them for the first time was life-changing. I had never experienced such comfort and support before, and I realized that my lifelong issue was unsupportive insoles. I used to suffer from severe foot pain whenever I wore flat-soled sneakers or dress shoes for any length of time. Now, I've bought a set of these insoles for every pair of shoes I own, and they're all incredibly comfortable—I can stand and walk in them for hours! I can't imagine wearing a pair of shoes without these insoles and when the time comes to get new shoes, I'll surely be swapping these in immediately!" — Dayv B$20 at Amazon12AmazonAn acupressure mat and pillow setThis mat and pillow set may seem intimidating, however an overwhelming number of reviewers swear by this accupressure tool to provide pain relief. Its cushioned surface is covered with over 10,000 hard plastic spikes that, though, are not a complete substitute for acupuncture, are meant to improve circulation and help relax muscles. The mat is available in both large (about 16 by 26 inches) and extra large (about 19 by 51 inches) sizes.Promising review: "I cannot express enough how much I am in love with this accupressure mat!!!! Yes, it hurts at first for the first few minutes.... but chances are you got this because you have pain anyways....why not grimace for another few minutes to experience the relaxing, pain relieving result while you lay on it and after!! My friend recommended this to me because of my horrible back pains and back diagnoses. I had no clue what I was in for. I did almost want to give up when first laying on it because it does really hurt at first, but then my minute 2-4, it just kinda becomes warm and relaxing. Last time my back went out, it was for 3 months. I was basically bed-ridden. I wish I had had this mat back then. However, since then, I have had those moments where I felt like it was going to go out, I put on a full body meditation channel on youtube, relax myself, lay on the mat for all of 10 minutes (you can go longer), and I am back to feeling better and pain free. It is my understanding you will gain even greater health benefits if you can make this part of your daily routine, but I can vouch how incredible it is even if you just do it when needed because of an onset of pain. Please, do yourself a favor and get this. Research though, there are different levels and and numbers of spikes. I bought a different kind with a less spikey feel, and I will occasionally use that one for the lower half of my body, because for my pain relief I have learned I need the extra spikey feel to get down to my nerves, tissues and muscles I guess. Neck pillow on this one is too much for my neck, but I learned you can put a thin cloth, like slide a thin pillowcase over it and then I am able to use the neck pillow. Love love love this... it has saved me on multiple occasions!!!!" — Storm$22 at AmazonAdvertisement
13AmazonAn impressively rated electrode TENS unitAn orthopedic surgeon previously told HuffPost that the theory behind TENS units is that they stimulate the superficial nerves in the body that exhaust some of the pain fibers that typically cause discomfort around a joint. This model is relatively affordable, has over 81,450 5-star Amazon ratings and features five therapy modes of custom stimulation. The attachments can adhere to areas like the wrists, hand and between fingers to help with conditions like carpal tunnel and arthritis.Promising review: "This has been a lifesaver for nerve pain! This thing is a game changer. I got it for lower back and neck pain, and it’s helped more than I expected—especially after long workdays or workouts. It takes a minute to figure out the settings, but once you get the hang of it, it's super customizable. The pulses are strong (in a good way), and it comes with everything you need. For the price, it’s basically like having a physical therapist at home." — Pmb$39 at Amazon14AmazonA podiatrist-approved foot stretcher for plantar fasciitisPodiatrist Louis J. DeCaro previously told HuffPost that when it comes to managing plantar fasciitis pain, "the best a [person] can really do is stretch the posterior column which runs from the hamstring down to the calf, to the Achilles and through the bottom of the foot to connect to the plantar fascia."DeCaro teaches his patients heel inversion stretches, which he said should be done "prior to all activities that involve running or long walks and should be done with the foot as neutral as possible."Although you don't need a device for the heel inversion or posterior column stretches that DeCaro refers to, many Amazon reviewers claim that this rocking foot stretcher has made "a world of difference" in treating their plantar fasciitis pain. The rocker design holds the foot in the optimal position for an accurate and efficient stretch and has slip-resistant pads to keep the stretcher in place while in use.Promising review: "I recently developed plantar fasciitis and it was causing me all kinds of pain in my knee, heel and ankle. Using this device before and after my runs made a world of difference. [The] pain is subsiding and I’m able to continue training. Such a great device for a hard-to-stretch area - highly recommend.” — Bels$23 at Amazon$24 at Medi-Dyne15AmazonA leg and hip stretching deviceThe brand refers to this device as a "comprehensive stretch solution" that can be used in several ways to safely stretch key areas like the hamstrings, hips and lower back. Lightweight, portable and made with a durable steel frame, regular use of this stretcher may alleviate sciatica pain and reduce muscle stiffness. One reviewer even claimed it helped them recover from knee surgery.Promising review: "This device was recommended by my physical therapist. It is worth every penny! I have problem arthritic knees. A gentle one minute stretch 2 or 3 times a day has already improved my knee mobility. I highly recommend it. Probably best to check with an MD or PT first to be sure it is appropriate for your issue." — carol$65 at AmazonAdvertisement
16AmazonAn extra large and plush heating padHeat can do amazing things for easing tension and pain and this extra-large heating pad is ideal for targeting large swaths of your body that might be experiencing discomfort or soreness. Covered in an extra soft plush cover, you can choose between three heat levels and have peace of mind thanks to the two-hour shut-off function. It's also machine washable and has a 10-foot long cord.Promising review: "My husband tweaked his back while working in the yard. We have a little heating pad, but purchased this one due to the XL size. My husband is over 6’ and having this larger size allowed for this heating pad to mostly cover his whole back. The cord is long enough that he can use it anywhere in the house. The heat is evenly distributed and consistent. The safety shutoff is nice for evening uses so you can use it at bedtime without the worry of any burns or skin damage. This is also a good size to wrap a leg and would be good for any chin splints, sports injuries, and knee pain. My husband also uses this for his torn meniscus flare-ups (from a high school FB injury that was never surgically fixed) and says it really helps to manage the pain. Huge plus, this cover is dark and easy to wash!" — Sara$40 at Amazon17AmazonA tension-relief epsom salt soakThis classic soaking solution by Dr. Teal's can help ease aches and soreness using Epsom salt, which breaks down into magnesium — a mineral that can be absorbed into the skin to relax muscles, reduce swelling and offer pain relief. This particular formula also contains a therapeutic blend of eucalyptus and spearmint essential oils to promote even more soothing power.Promising review: "I have been using Epsom salts bath soaks for years to relieve my aches and pains after a day spent working. But I like this best for occasional foot soaks which immediately relieve cramping of my feet and or lower legs. I love the strong scent as well which is truly relaxing. My favorite scent is the lavender but eucalyptus is great if you have a head cold as the scent will open your sinuses as you soak. My only complaint is that this product is getting so much more expensive these days. Otherwise I really love this product!" — Cheryl R.$6 at Amazon18AmazonA percussive massager that's actually heatedMany people swear by massage guns to improve circulation and manage muscle pain at home and this particular model by Renpho also incorporates the power of heat (or cold) therapy. It promises a strong percussive massage in a variety of intensities, four adjustable temperature settings and five different attachments. Promising review: "I have chronic pain and this massage gun is by far the BEST one I've ever owned! The cooling and heated head is life changing along with the other heads. It has great power and when connected to the app it'll cycle the power in auto mode. HIGHLY RECOMMEND this massage gun to everyone!!" — Bill L.$90 at AmazonAdvertisement
