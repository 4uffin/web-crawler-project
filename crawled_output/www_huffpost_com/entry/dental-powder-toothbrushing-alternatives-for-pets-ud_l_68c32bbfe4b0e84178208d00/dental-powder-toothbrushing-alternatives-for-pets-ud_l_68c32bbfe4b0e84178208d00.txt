This Vet-Approved Powder Can Make It Easier.Lost the toothbrushing battle with your dog or cat? Vets say you can add this plaque-reducing powder to their food.By Haley ZovickianStaff Writer, HuffPostSep 15, 2025, 08:00 AM EDTLEAVE A COMMENTThe experts consulted for this story do not necessarily endorse the products ahead unless otherwise noted.Neglecting dogs’ and cats’ dental health can lead to periodontal disease and even heart and kidney problems via bacteria that enters the bloodstream through the mouth. So it can feel crushing as a pet parent to deal with a fur child who absolutely loathes having their teeth brushed. Luckily, if tooth brushing does cause inordinate stress to your pet, you can try alternative tooth care methods, Dr. Nicole Savageau, a veterinarian with mobile pet service The Vets, explained in previous HuffPost reporting. One option that’s beloved by reviewers is ProDen’s Plaque Off dental powder for cats and dogs. By sprinkling some of the powder on your pet’s normal meals, the product helps prevent the formation of new plaque and softens existing tartar, according to the brand. Advertisement
$25 at AmazonThe power is an easy add to your pet’s daily routine that invests in their continued health and wellbeing. It also “saves me time AND money that would go towards future vet bills for tooth extraction and special prescription diets,” wrote a reviewer.″[I] can say with confidence that it’s worth every penny,” echoed one person, Jen.“This will definitely be a staple in our house for the rest of [my dog’s] life as long as they make it,” wrote another, Theresa.

AmazonProDen’s Plaque Off dental powder helps prevent the formation of new plaque, softens existing tartar and improves bad breath, according to ProDen.Recommended to many reviewers by their vets and other pet parents, the powder has been approved by the Veterinary Oral Health Council, or VOHC, which is “a committee comprised of veterinary dentists who review and then endorse products that provide effective plaque and tartar control,” explained Dr. Carly Fox, a senior veterinarian at New York City’s Schwarzman Animal Medical Center, in previous HuffPost coverage.The powder’s VOHC-approval is important since “typically, I recommend products that are approved by The Veterinary Oral Health Council” when it comes to pet dental health, said Fox. You can check out VOHC’s website for a list of their approved products, she added. (HuffPost has also included some of their approved products for dogs and cats below.)Advertisement

Combined with the powder’s results — “This is the first time I’ve ever been told [my cats’] teeth were actually GOOD,” one person wrote of a veterinarian visit — reviewers have deemed the product “a triumph” and “the real MVP.” The Plaque Off powder comes with a 330 milligram scoop for your use; the brand recommends you add 0.5-1 scoops daily for pets under 25 pounds, 1-2 scoops daily for pets that are 25-50 pounds and 2-3 scoops daily for pets over 50 pounds. Give the powder time to work, since with daily use, results can take three to eight weeks.Just remember that you should combine your pet’s home oral care with regular checkups with your veterinarian or a boarded veterinary dentist, Fox stressed. Consult with your vet before beginning this powder and watch out for any changes in your pet’s habits after incorporating the product. Advertisement

He’s 8 now and needs a scoop in each meal now but for his age, his breath, teeth and gums are in a lot better shape had we not used” — Miss M“as the owner of a senior chihuahua, I am no stranger to a puppy with stank breath. this little dude’s mouth smells like DEATH most of the time. once I started using this, though? game changer, genuinely made his breath WAY more tolerable. it does need some time and consistent use to start working, but it’s great. he ran out, and going without it the stank definitely started to come back, so I know this wasn’t some kind of placebo or anything. will be repurchasing asap!” — Kittie Choi“I have used this for years. Rescued new dog, took her to the veterinarian. He asked if I brushed her teeth? I told him no, I used plaque off. He was very impressed.” — Amazon Customer“Started giving this to my cat and his next vet check up he got complimented on his teeth twice! They thought I brushed his teeth regularly. He would never let me actually brush his teeth so this stuff does a great job! Is it a little pricey? Yeah. But it is worth it.” — faithAlso, check out more of VOHC’s approved products, plus get some advice on acclimating your pet to tooth brushing from Savageau and Fox, below.1AmazonA water additive formulated for dogs and cats"Water additives are an easy way to passively help prevent plaque formation in our pets," Fox previously told HuffPost. "I recommend starting with a smaller amount added to water and then building up so your pet can get used to the taste."This Vetradent water additive is recommended by the VOHC for use by dogs; its formula is designed for cats, as well. It's made to help reduce tartar and promote dental hygiene.$14 at Amazon$14 at Chewy2AmazonOr a water additive with almost 20,000 5-star ratingsTropiclean's popular water additive for dogs also comes recommended by the VOHC.Formulated to control plaque and tartar buildup while minimizing bad breath and bacteria growth, the additive is also available in versions with targeted digestive support, skin and coat health and more.$15 at Amazon$15 at Chewy3AmazonDental hygiene chews for dogsFox recommended these VOHC-approved OraVet dental chew treats, which are designed to help clean pets' teeth, prevent plaque and tartar accumulation and minimize bad breath.Read more about Oravet chews from HuffPost writer Lourdes Uribe, whose dog adored them.$22 at Amazon$25 at ChewyAdvertisement

They come in multiple pack sizes and flavors.$5+ at Amazon$5+ at Chewy6AmazonWant to try tooth brushing? Start slowIf your pet has never had their teeth brushed before, Fox and Savageau recommend initially getting your dog or cat used to having their mouth touched at all. “Start by touching their face and lips regularly,” Fox said. “You can try lifting up their lips and placing your fingers on the muzzle gently.” Then, you can try touching your pet’s teeth with your finger. “Each day, move on to touch more teeth, moving from front to back,” Fox detailed. And don't forget the power of positive reinforcement: “Treats and praise [can help] create a positive association with tooth brushing,” Savageau advised. (This can even include dental treats!)The next step? “Gently massage the gums using your finger or a finger toothbrush,” Fox advised. “Dental disease starts at the gum line, so massaging this area will allow your pet to get used to effective tooth brushing.” Based on this advice, we think the Jasper finger brush is a great option. The bestselling brush, which I use with my own cat, sports soft silicone bristles on all sides to gently clean the mouth while helping remove plaque. The tool uses BPA- and phthalate-free silicone and is designed to fit most finger sizes. It also comes with a case to store the brush. It comes in a 2-pack.$14 at Amazon$14 at ChewyAdvertisement
7AmazonA soft-bristled toothbrush made for petsOnce your pet is comfortable with having their gums massaged, it’s time to introduce a pet toothbrush. “Try and brush their teeth for two minutes every day,” Fox said. “A routine is key, so if you are able to do it at the same time each day, your pet will learn to expect it.” (Don’t worry if your pet has a setback once you introduce a toothbrush, Fox noted. Simply return to massaging their gums, but with the toothbrush this time, until they’re ready to move on.) As you search for oral health tools for your dog or cat, "it's important to use toothbrushes and toothpastes specifically designed for pets," Savageau said.For toothbrushes, look for pet-specific options "with soft bristles and [that are] an appropriate size for your pet's mouth," Savageau said. Fox recommended this Petsmile toothbrush in particular. Made for dogs and cats, the Petsmile brush sports heads on both ends, one for larger pets (with larger mouths) and one for smaller pets with more petite jaws. Both heads' outer bristles are angled at 45 degrees to effectively clean your pet's enamel, while their center bristles tackle bacteria and plaque below the gum lines.$14 at Amazon$14 at Chewy8AmazonA meat-flavored enzymatic toothpaste for dogs and catsFor toothpaste, it's crucial to select a pet-safe toothpaste without xylitol, which is toxic to dogs, according to Savageau."Brands like C.E.T. Enzymatic Toothpaste are often recommended by veterinarians," Savageau wrote. You might also want to opt for flavors like poultry or beef, which pets find more appealing, she added.I use the C.E.T. toothpaste for my own cat. I'm convinced its poultry flavor helps make the tooth brushing process more tolerable for her.$12 at Amazon$12 at Chewy9AmazonOr a widely-recommended Petsmile toothpasteThe Petsmile toothpaste, also recommended by Fox, is another solid option that's been approved by the VOHC. $15 at Amazon$15 at ChewyAdvertisement
