Finally, you can take the guesswork out of your beauty routine — no more gambling your money on a new product that might not work or spending hours browsing reviews and Reddit threads.Often, people are thrilled to gush about their holy grail products, something I discovered when I posed the question to other HuffPost employees. Body washes, serums, sheet masks, setting powder — there are so many HuffPost editor-approved beauty and skin care gems you might not have considered on your hunt for your own holy grail.Advertisement
If you’re tired of being fed sponsored recommendations by influencers that don’t work for you and are craving honest reviews of the products that are truly hypeworthy, I don’t blame you. Keep reading for takes on beauty and skin care items from people of all genders who have been using them for years. Your holy grail awaits.1AmazonAquaphor healing balm stick"As a proud ChapStick they, I am nothing without my beloved Aquaphor stick," said shopping writer Griffin Wynne. "I use it all over my face and body and truly recommend it for anyone who likes a gentle one-and-done product that will keep you from totally drying out. It costs more money than a basic $1 lip balm (which I also like) but really can be used all over and will last you awhile, as it's a pretty dense stick."$10 at Amazon$10 at Target$13 at Ulta2Amazon, Supergoop, Robbie Ross/CanvaSupergoop! Unseen sunscreen"This fragrance-free sunscreen is pricier than others but I declare it's worth every penny spent and I buy it on repeat," Marquaysa Battle, deputy managing editor on the shopping team, previously wrote. "It's super lightweight on my face thanks to an oil-free formula and it offers SPF 40 sun protection.""Lastly and most important to me, it looks GREAT on my face," Battle added. "Most sunscreens on the market give me a white cast that I hate. As powerful as this one is, the product isn't visually detectable. Because a little goes a long way, I keep one mini-size for daily use and another in my toiletry bag for travel. The sunscreen is water- and sweat-resistant for up to 40 minutes and can even be worn under makeup."$18+ at Amazon3TargetNaturium The Energizer mandelic acid body wash"I'm obsessed with this body wash — especially after a sweaty gym sesh — because it really just eliminates the funk but also is so gentle," said senior culture editor Erin Evans.The body wash has a cooling formula that works to fight body odor while delivering a refreshing burst of energy thanks to the inclusion of citrus and herbal aromatic extracts. Just make sure to be mindful about sun protection. The brand notes that this body wash contains an alpha hydroxy acid, or AHA, which can increase your skin's sensitivity to sunburn.$17 at Target$17 at UltaAdvertisement
4AmazonFirst Aid Beauty ultra repair cream"This lightweight but super hydrating cream is perfect for my dry skin and also does a great job eliminating any redness," one HuffPost editor said. "It’s so good that it even calmed down a rash on my face caused by lupus. It’s an immediate repurchase for me when I get to the bottom of the tub."$14+ at Amazon$18+ at Sephora$38 at DermstoreAdvertisement
5AmazonEucerin advanced repair body cream for very dry skin"I usually don't get dry skin, but last year I had one patch on my right elbow that REFUSED to stay moisturized no matter what I put on it. I asked some of the other editors at HuffPost what they used, and someone told me to try Eucerin advanced repair body cream for very dry skin," said Noah Michelson, head of HuffPost Personal. "I was skeptical — it isn't expensive, it isn't fancy. Could this really do what every other product had failed to do? It turns out IT COULD. IT DID. That patch disappeared in record time, and now I always have a tub of this body cream in my bathroom."$13 at Amazon$13 at Target$13 at Walmart6SephoraThe Inkey List bio-active ceramide repairing and plumping moisturizer"This Inkey List moisturizer has tamed my rosacea, rescued my perpetually dry skin and made my makeup look so much better and smoother," said senior life editor Lindsay Holmes.This moisturizer has anti-aging qualities, such as fine line and wrinkle reduction, and the brand claims it delivers up to 24 hours of hydration. The 1.7-ounce size of the tub also makes this a great product to take on the go.$16 at Amazon$22 at SephoraAdvertisement
7SephoraArmani Luminous Silk foundation"While it is pricey, it is worth it," said senior producer Leah Mark about the Armani Luminous Silk foundation. "It elevates my skin for events and makes my whole makeup look put together and flawless." (We've previously covered the internet's ardor for this beloved product and found out that our readers love it, too.)The Luminous Silk foundation has medium coverage and a luminous finish and purports to last for 24 hours of wear. It's available in up to 40 shades and comes in both a full-size (1 ounce) and a mini (0.6 ounce) version. The shades pictured here are 1.5 and 15.$48+ at Nordstrom$48+ at Sephora8NordstromKiehl's ultra facial creamAt least four HuffPosters, including myself, love Kiehl's ultra facial cream, so you know this is a good one. "Been using it FOR YEARS, gone through a number of tubs," Mark said. "It's so lightweight and melts into the skin."I have since traded this cream for the similar Kiehl's ultra facial moisturizer, mostly because I prefer using a bottle with a cap over putting my fingers into a tub. But I do love taking the smaller tub of Ultra facial cream with me when I'm traveling, just because it's so easy to fit in my bag without taking up much space.$26+ at Amazon$26+ at Nordstrom$26+ at Ulta9AmazonCaudalie Vinoperfect brightening dark spot serum"Caudalie Vinoperfect dark spot serum is magic in a bottle!" said copy editor Shonitria Anthony. "It's pricey but worth every penny. I accidentally scratched my forehead last summer, leaving a scar. I used this serum twice a day, focusing on the scratch, and by Thanksgiving, the scar from the scratch was gone. Magic in a bottle, I tell you!"The serum contains Viniferine, a vitamin C alternative that the brand claims is 62 times more effective at correcting dark spots. Also, pro tip: buy the serum on Prime Day for a nice discount!$82 at Amazon$82 at SephoraAdvertisement
10TargetSaltair Santal Bloom serum body wash"I recently became obsessed with this body wash by Saltair this year," Anthony said. "The sandalwood scent is heavenly. It doesn't strip my skin of its moisture, and it lasts what feels like forever."The body wash has scent notes of sandalwood, amber and musk and is formulated with ascorbyl glucoside and niacinamide to correct dark spots. It's sold in a two-pack on Amazon, or you can buy a single bottle at Target.2-pack: $26 at AmazonSingle bottle: $13 at Target11AmazonCosrx acne pimple master patches"As an adult with acne, I swear by the blemish-healing function of these pimple patches," shopping writer Haley Zovickian previously wrote. "It's incredibly satisfying to remove the patches after hours of wear and see evidence of their work, the patches swollen with oil and gunk and my spots noticeably flatter.""I buy them in bulk and I fastidiously ensure I never run low on them; they are my true desert island holy grail," Zovickian added. "Plus, they help protect my skin from my wandering fingers and picking."3-pack: $12 at AmazonSingle pack: $6 at UltaSingle pack: $4 at Stylevana12AmazonDr. Jart+ Ceramidin skin barrier moisturizing cream"I've long loved Dr. Jart's famous Ceramidin cream for helping nourish and heal my parched skin, particularly as I continue living in a desert where, as my skin frequently reminds me, humans are not actually supposed to settle down (at least, not those faint of heart)," Zovickian previously wrote."Reviewers seem to agree, with one aptly describing the thick lotion being 'like desert rain for dry skin,'" Zovickian added. "Its blend of five ceramides, shea butter and glycerin infuses hydration back into the skin while supporting a healthy skin barrier. I also love how fast-absorbing it is."$38 at Amazon$50 at SephoraAdvertisement
13Amazon, ภาพของnisara/CanvaHeritage Store rosewater toner"In 2020, I had an extreme dry skin period with an unusual amount of acne breakouts," Battle previously wrote. "I learned from aestheticians and dermatologists that breakouts can happen due to your skin over-producing oil in response to dehydration. Down for something cheaper than a co-pay, I looked up this rosewater moisturizing essence after an aesthetician recommended it on Twitter. Of course, I dived into the ingredients first and to my surprise, the essence does contain fragrance! The reason I still tried it: It's all-natural, derived from real roses and not some synthetic fragrance made up in a lab. The toner itself restores the skin's pH balance while keeping it hydrated and supple thanks to hyaluronic acid and sodium PCA.""I used the hydrating toner with a mega-hydrating night cream and my face returned to normal in no time," Battle added. "I now use the night cream only as needed but I still use this toner daily — after cleansing but before moisturizing. Dryness, solved!"$12 at Amazon14AmazonDabur Amla hair oil"I want everyone to save their money on expensive pre-wash oils and just get this," one HuffPoster said about the Dabur Amla hair oil. "Just give yourself a scalp massage with it and work your way down strands (like my grandma would), keep it on for like an hour minimum, and then wash it off when detangling in the shower. My hair was so damaged/thinning from long COVID [and] hard water [and] stress, and this was the ONLY product that has boosted hair growth and thickened it so there’s more volume."$13 at Amazon15www.amazon.comLiving Proof dry shampooThe same HuffPoster heartily recommended Living Proof's near-legendary dry shampoo, calling it her "saving grace on gym days." Senior shopping writer Lourdes Uribe has also previously written about the oil- and sweat-absorbing spray, which uses rice starch to impart a clean and refreshed finish to your tresses.“I was not expecting that it would fully blow my mind,” Uribe said.$33+ at AmazonAdvertisement
16Everyday OilEveryday Oil Mainstay multipurpose oil and moisturizer"I saw a bougie friend of mine had this on her nightstand once and assumed it would be just like, greasy feeling or smell weird. To my surprise, it's literally the best-smelling, most nourishing all-over body oil that I now purchase for myself regularly," Wynne said. "You can put it on your face, body, hair and nails and use it as a face cleanser, but I usually just cover myself in it after the shower. I buy the giant one about once or twice a year and then have a mini for traveling."Among other things, it has jojoba in it, which, per all the skincare experts I've ever interviewed, is an oil that is very similar to the natural oil our skin produces, so it works well for most skin types," Wynne added. "It's a nice palo santo scent that's like expensive minimalist store vibes and not too earthy/crunchy. I have been asked what perfume I'm wearing when it's just this."Anthony agreed: "I love this body oil so much! It's light on the skin, so no oily residue. It smells great without being overpowering. It keeps my skin oh-so-soft and gives me a glow year-round."$24+ at Credo Beauty17UltaTonymoly I'm Rice exfoliating enzyme cleanser"This Tonymoly cleanser is incredible, and I make sure I never run out of it," said shopping writer Kevin Cortez. "I have a problem with most gel-based cleansers irritating or building up on my skin, so I grabbed this powdered one, and I haven't used anything since. You just sprinkle a little from the body, add water and scrub/foam it all over your face. It feels really good and soothing, and it's gentle enough that I could use it daily!""Legit, I've never had an issue with it drying out my skin. It feels really nice when I wash it off, and I've noticed my face is less oily overall. HIGHLY recommend," Cortez added.$14 at Amazon$14 at Ulta18StylevanaIshizawa-Lab Keana pore care rice masks"I became obsessed with these rice milk sheet masks during a trip to Japan earlier this year," said Mollie Reilly, managing editor of breaking news. "They sell them everywhere there, but in the States, you can get 10 packs on Stylevana for a very reasonable price! They are the best sheet masks I've ever used, they instantly hydrate and soothe my skin."10-pack: $11 at StylevanaAdvertisement
19AmazonKP Bumps Be Gone whole-body exfoliator and moisturizer"AmLactin was recommended to me by a derm and is the next best thing to prescription anti-itch goops," one HuffPoster wrote.She specifically has used the KP Bumps Be Gone whole-body exfoliator and moisturizer, which she puts on her legs after a shower.The lotion uses lactic acid to exfoliate dead skin cells, but it's also a moisturizer that softens the skin, so you can cut down on the number of products you have to use.$16 at Amazon$22 at Target$20 at Ulta20TargetCocokind vitamin C glow serum"I’m on at least my 10th bottle of this vitamin C serum," said editorial operations coordinator Alexandra Niforos. "I feel like it’s more affordable than a lot of vitamin C serums, and it’s never broken me out. I used to get a lot of acne, and it’s cleared up all the scars I had on my face, which is amazing."$22 at Amazon$22 at Target$22 at Ulta21AmazonHawaiian Tropic Weightless Hydration after sun lotion"I’ve turned everyone in my life onto this lotion, which is only $8 and smells amazing," Niforos said.The lotion is "specifically meant to be used after you’ve been out in the sun (at the beach, pool, etc.) because it helps retain your tan. I keep mine in the fridge so that it’s extra cooling," Niforos added.2-pack: $15 at Amazon2-pack: $15 at TargetAdvertisement
22AmazonChristophe Robin cleansing purifying scalp scrub"I am shamefully low maintenance when it comes to my hair, and I tend to get a ton of buildup in my scalp between infrequent washings, but this scrub leaves my scalp and hair feeling squeaky clean beyond belief, and the addition of the mask hydrates my strands post-cleanse," said Emily Ruane, managing editor of the shopping team. "I try to buy it on sale, but it's absolutely worth every penny, even at full price. I use it with the brand's prickly pair mask, and it's like, indescribably luxurious."$54 at Amazon$20+ at Nordstrom23UltaMagic Molecule antimicrobial hypochlorous acid spray"I'm an avid user of hypochlorous acid, and consider it more essential to my skin care routine than moisturizer," Zovickian previously wrote. "I use it twice daily to calm my sensitive, cystic acne-prone skin and to cleanse my easily irritated eyelids. I also deal with periorial dermatitis, a facial rash that’s similar to rosacea, and hypochlorous acid is the only ingredient that I’ve found has made a noticeable difference for me besides oral medication.""This version is my personal favorite thanks to its purported stability and FDA-cleared formula," Zovickian added. "I keep a bottle on my vanity at all times and make sure to never run out!"$20 at Ulta24SephoraTarte creaseless loose setting powder"I finally tried this setting powder after seeing almost every beauty influencer I follow tout its shine-reducing abilities," said wellness reporter Jillian Wilson. "They were SO right. It blends easily and keeps me shine-free for hours, even in the summer. It's also nice and small, so I can throw it in my purse for touch-ups throughout the day."The powder comes in six shades. The shades pictured here are chestnut and lavender.$37 at SephoraAdvertisement
