Needless to say, I typically stick to liquid foundations and steer far, far away from stick formulations. Recently, though, Live Tinted — the first South Asian-owned makeup brand to launch at Ulta Beauty — launched a complexion stick. Me being a long-time lover of the brand’s Huebeam Gradient blushing bronzer, I knew I had to put some trust into the universe and give the new Huestick complexion stick a try. Spoiler alert: I’m so glad I did. $38 at UltaAdvertisement
The launch comes after the Huestick corrector won fans over for its customizable color-correcting magic. Unlike the corrector stick, which promises to neutralizes redness, dark circles, hyperpigmentation and sallowness with a few quick swipes, the Huestick complexion stick is meant to provide smooth, buildable coverage and all-day wear without feeling heavy or cakey. True to the brand ethos, though, both formulas are designed to be accessible and inclusive, offering shades that work for a wide range of skin tones and formulas that are easy to use for every skill level.UltaTrue to the brand ethos, though, both formulas are designed to be accessible and inclusive, offering shades that work for a wide range of skin tones and formulas that are easy to use for every skill level.$38 at UltaAdvertisement
Swiping on the complexion stick is pure magic. Available in 20 shades, the formula is incredibly creamy and glides effortlessly across the skin, blending seamlessly without the need for tugging or dragging. From the first swipe, it feels nourishing and lightweight, giving a natural, skin-like finish that doesn’t feel heavy or mask-like. Application-wise, the formula blends beautifully with both a brush and sponge (impressive considering I typically only use brushes with stick products). I prefer using a sponge on days I want lighter coverage and a dense stippling brush on occasions I’d like more coverage.What really impressed me about this formula is how buildable it is. You can start with a sheer layer for a quick, polished look, or build it up in areas that need more coverage (for me, that’s the center of my face where I have some redness). In any case, it never looks cakey or overly done — something I appreciate given how well it covers.$38 at UltaAdvertisement
But the foundation stick isn’t just about coverage — it’s also packed with skin-friendly ingredients for a true foundation-meets-skincare hybrid. It includes ceramides, which help strengthen the skin barrier and boost hydration; squalane, a lightweight moisturizer that smooths the skin; and hyaluronic acid, known for its ability to hydrate, soothe and plump the skin.In terms of staying power, the formula passes with flying colors. Even after hours of wear, it stays comfortable and doesn’t settle into fine lines or dry patches, which is a rare feat for stick foundations on my skin type. Another standout feature of the Huestick is how effortlessly other products layer on top. Whether it’s a cream or powder blush and bronzer, whatever I apply on top blends seamlessly without disturbing the base. Formulas applied afterward sit beautifully without looking patchy or cakey — it’s the kind of stick that makes creating a polished base feel easy and stress-free.$38 at UltaAdvertisement
Still looking for the right foundation? Senior shopping writer Tessa Flores previously rounded up 11 skin-perfecting SPF foundations for added protection:1SephoraA viral color correcting full-coverage foundationThe It Cosmetics CC+ cream has been my exclusive foundation of choice for a number of reasons, namely that it makes my skin look absolutely flawless and makes any blemishes virtually imperceptible. I also have keratosis pilaris on my face and this is the one perfectly finished foundation that hides all imperfections without looking cake-y or unnatural in the slightest. Plus, the color-correcting formula is also infused with broad spectrum SPF 50 and a whole slew of skin-loving ingredients like hyaluronic acid, peptides and niacinamide so it never feels overly drying on the face. It comes in 22 shades.And heads up: While it's $47 at both Amazon and Ulta, you can grab it in mini sizes starting at $22 from Sephora so I suggest first-timers start there.$47 at Amazon$22+ at Sephora$47 at Ulta2AmazonAn SPF 50 antioxidant serum foundationIntentionally formulated to for lightweight wear that won't settle into fine lines, this concentrated serum foundation for mature skin promises a radiant finish, buildable coverage and broad spectrum SPF 50 protection. Available in 15 shades, this foundation also contains vitamin B3, an antioxidant that can neutralize environmental stressors responsible for premature skin aging. Promising Ulta review: "I don't know why this isn't sold in stores! It's absolutely fantastic! I don't normally like wearing liquid foundation because it feels heavy but this one is so light and actually does provide good coverage without the heaviness. I have plenty of acne scars and discoloration and it makes my skin appear almost flawless - basically solid coverage without feeling like full coverage heavy foundation. I don't even need to wear concealer under my eyes or elsewhere when I use this. I like to apply it by squeezing a few lines onto each area of my face directly from the tube and then work it in with a brush. I go back in with a dab of liquid bronzer to give my face dimension. If I have time I'll let it dry 5-10 min and set very lightly by pushing in some setting powder. It ends up with a nice dewy finish but if you go heavier on the setting powder you can get closer to matte if that's what you like. Lastly, I wear the ivory shade which works in combination with the bronzer but would otherwise be too pale (I'm a 2N1 in Estee Lauder powder in winter and 2N2 in summer). I just ordered the golden ivory in this product for summer but again, with bronzer the ivory still works for me all year." — Amy$9+ at Amazon$18 at Ulta3SephoraA soothing and natural finish foundationPerfect for skin types that are sensitive or acne-prone, Tower 28's tinted sunscreen foundation has broad spectrum SPF 30 sun protection and is formulated with a few different ingredients to stave off redness and irritation, like white sage extract. Additionally, prickly pear extract helps ward off blue light pollution, which is the type of UV that emits from all your electronic devices. This foundation provides a lightweight feel, buildable coverage and comes in 17 shades. $32 at Amazon$32 at Sephora$32 at RevolveAdvertisement
4SephoraA long-wearing and high-coverage foundationGiorgio Armani Beauty has a reputation for crafting some of the best foundation out there (does Luminous Silk ring any bells?) and this formula — the Power Fabric + — shares a lot of factors that make the famed Luminous Silk so great, but with the addition of SPF 25. This long-wearing and high-coverage foundation has a matte finish, without drying out the skin, and uses the brand's patented "Micro-fil technology" to ensure that the foundation's pigments lay seamlessly on the skin. Shop this in 30 shades, but also take note that additional sun protection might be needed since this level of SPF falls slightly below the suggested minimum presented by the American Academy of Dermatology. $70 at Sephora$70 at Nordstrom5AmazonA sheer-coverage dewy skin tintIt's possible that you've probably already heard of this much-buzzed-about skin tint that's perfect for anyone who is opposed to thick full-coverage foundations that mask your own skin. Ilia's Super Serum is an all-in-one skin tint featuring a moisturizing formula that's infused with mineral SPF 40, niacinamide, hyaluronic acid and squalane — all really great hydrators.As someone who owns this stuff, there is a learning curve with using this, however. It's truly meant to give you a very dewy, your-skin-but-better kind of finish so I avoid putting on any thick face creams underneath this. Instead I just really work it into my skin until it absorbs almost like a face lotion, then apply a tiny dusting of my Coty Airspun powder on areas where I don't want the shine. Find it in 30 shades. $48 at Amazon$48 at Sephora$48 at Ulta6SephoraA hydrating SPF foundation with brightening niacinamideThe Kosas Skin-Improving foundation claims to plump and hydrate with the help of peptides, smooth texture and brighten the complexion thanks to niacinamide — all while offering broad sun protection in the form of SPF 25, including against blue light pollution. This medium-coverage formula, which is also enriched with skin-protecting antioxidants, comes in 27 shades. It may need to be worn with additional sun protection since this level of SPF falls slightly below the suggested minimum presented by the AAD. Promising Amazon review: "Love the smoothness of my skin and the perfect way it blends - no one would think I was wearing makeup- I’m 71 and finding that changes to my skin make a foundation like this so valuable- no caking or indication that I’m using it - and this one bottle will go a long way - love the sunscreen protection too!" — dakotareader$42 at Amazon$42 at Sephora$42 at RevolveAdvertisement
7TargetAn SPF 30 whipped foundationThis uniquely whipped foundation by Colorescience is packed to the gills with ingredients meant to improve and care for skin, such as collagen-boosting peptides, a nourishing vitamin complex and ceramides, which are the essential building blocks to a healthy skin barrier. It's available in four flexible shades and uses a mineral complex to provide SPF 30 sun protection. $59 at Amazon$40 at Target (regularly $59)8AmazonAn all-in-one foundation to target premature skin agingAvailable in 12 shades, this cream foundation by No7 claims to offer a medium coverage that blurs imperfections, conceals redness and leaves skin feeling hydrated. In addition to offering SPF 50 in broad-spectrum sun protection, the formula contains antioxidants to preserve the skin and fend off environmental factors that could cause premature skin aging. Promising Amazon review: "This is my favorite foundation. It covers all my uneven skin tone without looking too heavy and provides the best sun protection of any foundation I have found. It's actually a plus that it's not particularly moisturizing; I can control the amount of moisturizer that I put on beneath it. Likewise, I'm not looking for a super lightweight formula, but rather for good even coverage." — Janet in Seattle $16 at Amazon$17 at Walgreens9AmazonA moisturizing foundation with SPF 45With this Estee Lauder moisturizing foundation, you'll enjoy up to 12 hours or full-coverage wear, SPF 45 sun protection and a nourishing formula containing chia seed extract and soothing probiotics for the skin. It's available in 28 shades and reviewers claim that it goes on smooth and won't cake or settle into fine lines. $55 at Amazon$55 at Sephora$55 at UltaAdvertisement
10AmazonA full-coverage cream mineral foundation with SPF 30For anyone that's in need of the fullest-coverage foundation around, Dermablend is a trusted source for fully opaque formulations that are often used for covering tattoos, scars, irregular pigmentation and more. The Cover Cream boasts this same type of high pigment but with the added benefit of mineral SPF 30 in the form of titanium dioxide. It's available in 21 shades. $42 at Amazon$42 at Macy's11SephoraA medium coverage serum foundationThis unique serum foundation by indie beauty brand Ciele is proving to be a sleeper hit among Sephora shoppers who claim that its performance is "earth-shattering," "genius" and a "new favorite base product." Not only does the second skin-like formula promise to hide imperfections and redness, the natural-finish fluid contains a whopping SPF 50 sun protection so you can skip the step of applying both products. Available in 13 shades, it contains soothing allantoin, redness-reducing bisabolol and antioxidant-rich niacinamide for strengthening the skin's natural barrier.Promising Sephora review: "I was a full coverage CC cream girl before I tried a sample of this stuff... HOOKED. The coverage is enough to mask my redness, and I love the liquidy consistency-- it's an absolute breeze to blend. I have large pores, & it doesn't immediately get stuck in them like my CC cream did (yay for spending less time putting on my face/worrying about it looking cakey). This also gives you a really healthy looking glow-- but if you want a more matte look, pat a little powder on top & you're good." — killerteeth$44 SephoraRelatedshoppingBeautyMakeupfoundationThis Viral Low-Maintenance Foundation Stick Is Adored By People With Mature SkinI Have Perpetually Dry Skin And This Lightweight Sunscreen Is A Major WinThis $11 Setting Spray Has A Cult Following — And It’s Worth The Hype Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
