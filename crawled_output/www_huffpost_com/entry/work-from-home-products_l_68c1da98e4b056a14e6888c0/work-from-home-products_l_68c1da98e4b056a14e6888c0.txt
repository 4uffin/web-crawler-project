These 25 Products Will Help You Get It Together (And Maybe Find Your Desk Under There)You’ll be shooketh at how much more productive you feel when your matcha isn’t balancing on a stack of papers.Daysha Edewi— BuzzFeed ShoppingSep 18, 2025, 08:00 AM EDTLEAVE A COMMENT1Amazon, www.amazon.comA stylish to-do list plannerPromising review: "Living a chaotic life with ADD, I desperately needed control of my life — everything to do, yet nothing got done. In my search on Amazon for the perfect planner, I kept coming back to this one. Boy, was I glad to have made that choice. I was instantly impressed by the sturdy cover, metal-covered corners, and the elastic band that held the planner together. I saw the pictures ahead of time, and they were true. Each page contains exactly what I need to get better organized. I love the freedom to write the date at the top, monitor water intake, write something to be grateful for, and the other needed sections. The pocket in the back is handy. I loved it all, but if they ever want to make an improvement, then just adding one page in the end with short/and long-term goals would have been handy for me. Overall, however, I give this an A+." — serenabell$7 at Amazon2www.amazon.comA three-in-one wireless charger to keep your desk from looking like a bird's nestAnd if you're team Android, I got chu, too — check out this charger.Promising review: "Great to have on your desk at work. No matter how busy my day is, I never have to worry about running low on my charge on any of my Apple products — from earbuds to my watch to my phone. I’m good, no matter how much video streaming or other activities happen to me during the day. I’m always ready to recharge, simple and easy." — Chris Dennis$40 at Amazon3www.amazon.comA desktop vacuumIt's also small enough to live on your desk without taking up an obnoxious amount of space.Promising review: "This vacuum cleaner is a game changer for keeping my desk tidy. It is super efficient at picking up dust, crumbs, and small debris without being noisy or bulky. The compact size makes it easy to store, and it works perfectly on desks, tables, or any small surface. I love the energy-saving auto power-off function, which is a smart feature to prevent unnecessary power use. It’s easy to empty and maintain, and the suction power is surprisingly strong for its size. If you're looking for a simple, efficient way to keep your workspace clean, this vacuum is definitely worth it. Highly recommend!" — Jack$13 at AmazonAdvertisement
4www.amazon.comA headphone standPromising review: "This headphone stand was super easy to assemble and feels very sturdy. The aluminum bar and solid base give it a premium feel, and it holds my headphones securely without any wobble. I liked it enough that I ended up buying a second one. Great value and does exactly what it’s supposed to." — Austin Plitt$7 at AmazonAdvertisement
5www.amazon.comA computer monitor memo boardThere's also an option that will hold up your phone, too!Promising review: "What a simple, but ingenious concept. I hate sticky notes all over my desk, but I still put them there! Having them front and center, eye level, makes me acknowledge them more. I address what's on the note faster, and can trash the note after I'm done. Or I use a very hot pink sticky for things I want to be aware of all the time. The eye level thing is key. This is a great product and easy to install." — Kelly in MI$7 at Amazon6www.amazon.comA document clip that holds up to four sheets of paper right at eye levelPromising review: "This was the second one I have purchased because they do a great job. It holds the paper securely, and it's easy to transfer from one side of the computer screen to the other as I often do for ergonomic reasons." — C Oregon$17 at AmazonAdvertisement

One of the best features is the built-in storage compartment, which has helped me keep my desk much tidier by storing pens, sticky notes, and other small items right inside. It also works perfectly as a keyboard stand, creating a more ergonomic setup and freeing up space on my workspace. The writing surface is smooth and erases completely without any residue or ghosting, even after extended use. If you're looking for a versatile and space-saving dry-erase solution that goes beyond just writing, this is a fantastic option. Clean, practical, and thoughtfully designed — I highly recommend it!" — Priscila Carmo$22 at Amazon8www.amazon.comA sleek stand that will raise your laptop by six inchesPromising review: "This aluminum laptop stand exceeded my expectations. It’s incredibly sturdy, with a sleek, modern design that looks great on any desk. The ergonomic height and angle make a big difference for comfort during long hours of work, reducing neck and back strain. I love that it’s detachable — it makes it easy to pack and take on the go. It keeps my laptop cool with great ventilation and stays firmly in place without wobbling. A simple, high-quality solution that’s worth every penny!" — TB$16 at Amazon9www.amazon.comAnd a monitor stand to literally level up your desk areaPromising review: "This monitor stand is exactly what I needed!

Highly recommend!" — Michelle Cheng$16+ at Etsy11www.amazon.comA digital clock that is large enough to help you keep track of your breaksPromising review: "It’s so sleek and affordable — just what I needed for my home office. I love that it displays the time/date and temperature, so make sure not to lose your remote! It came with non-damaging 3M wall stickies, so it functions as a wall clock, but it also came with a small desk stand, so you can also display it on your desk. I appreciate that you can change the brightness levels too — I‘m obsessed!!!" — Anna Shim$17 at Amazon12www.amazon.comA daily flip calendarPromising review: "It is super cute, minimalistic, easy to flip. It makes for a cute, but professional calendar display." — Tori$19 at AmazonAdvertisement

These drawers were the perfect solution! For less than $9, I was able to add storage to my existing monitor riser. The drawers are the perfect size for storing pads of paper, pens, highlighters, etc. The adhesive stuck well to the riser and remains firmly in place. Definitely recommend for a workspace storage solution!" — Ty$15 at Amazon15www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comA label maker if your current WFH set up is held together by random cordsPsst — The app to use to operate the label maker is free and requires no registration.Promising review: "This is my favorite label maker by far. With the use of the app, you have so many text options, printing is fast and easy. Compact and cute, it’s super easy to keep in my desk drawer or purse. A roll of tape lasts a really long time. You can’t beat how easy to use it is, how seamless printing is, the text options, and the portability of this little baby. This is the best label maker under $50." — Jess$17 at AmazonAdvertisement
16www.amazon.comA pack of cord holders that will actually keep your laptop charger on your deskThese holders have a 0.3 diameter, which means they can hold most cables like USB-C, lightning cables, HDMI, and more.Promising review: "Absolutely amazing! I think this is the one item everyone needs in their homes. I stick them behind the nightstands and my desk to keep all the wires hidden, and the wires don't fall behind the nightstands and your desk. Love how the clip even hinges open or closed in case you need to take out your AC charger. Self-sticking works best on smooth surfaces." — Rod$7 at Amazon17Amazon, AmazonA cable management boxIt's also great at keeping curious kiddos and pets from ending up in the emergency room.Promising review: "I bought this cable management box to organize the power strips and cords under my desk. It was easy to set up and fit all the cables inside. The wood lid looks nice and blends well with my furniture. The box is sturdy and has enough ventilation holes to prevent overheating. It also has rubber feet to prevent sliding. I am very happy with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone who wants to hide their messy cords." — JL $15 at Amazon18AmazonAnd a pack of cord labelsPromising review: "These wrap-it tags are perfect. It beats using tape to identify the cords, especially under my computer desk! After a while, the 'writing' on the tapes starts fading, and it's frustrating having to figure out which is the printer, telephone cable, computer, modem cords, etc. Not sticky, the tags have a velcro inner lining, so it's easy to put on and remove." — K. Lum$16 at AmazonAdvertisement
19www.amazon.comA set of wall file organizersPromising review: "Easy to assemble, nice space-saving storage for the office. Would recommend.

This works perfectly!" — JT Avid Reader$28 at Amazon20www.amazon.comOr a triangle file holderPromising review: "This is perfect.

The swivel and height adjustment make it handy for snacks, my laptop, or just chilling with coffee. It slides right under my couch and swivels exactly where I need it. It is sturdy and doesn't wobble when I type. It's perfect for small space living and looks nice." — Chaney$45 at AmazonAdvertisement
22www.amazon.comA pad protector so that your desk looks as pristine as the day you unboxed itPromising review: "This desk pad completely upgraded my workspace. It looks clean and professional, and the surface is smooth enough for both typing and using a mouse without a separate pad. It’s non-slip, waterproof, and super easy to clean. The size (90 x 43 cm) is perfect for my keyboard, laptop, and a few extras. Highly recommended for anyone wanting to protect their desk and improve their setup!" — Pato$10 at Amazon23www.amazon.comA mini bookshelf made from solid woodPromising review: "I bought this desk shelf because I needed more storage on top of my desk. This was perfect!! The wood is a nice quality and not crappy at all!!! The shelves assemble into two pieces, so they are adjustable in size, which is perfect for what I needed! I definitely recommend! Also super easy to put together (took me 10 minutes)." — Zoey$23 at Amazon24www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comA pack of chic ceramic coastersAnd just FYI — these are hand-wash only.Promising review: "I have a black-and-white look for my computer desk. These ceramic coasters pop nicely off the black desk mat I purchased. It's great for hot and cold drinks, they look great, and the small wire holder helps keep the majority of them out of the way. Would suggest to others." — Robert Oszust$9 at AmazonAdvertisement
25www.amazon.comA sophisticated pack of felt tilesPromising review: "Very good quality, I got tons of compliments and many others wanted to purchase too. Adhesive tabs are very strong and hold great, easy to put on the wall. Love the charcoal color. The size was perfect for my office. The only downside was lots of “felt dust” when first taking it out of the package. Recommend a quick vacuum of the tiles before putting up or taking out of the box on the floor and brushing off before putting up. But love this product — highly recommend!!" — Amazon Customer$40 at AmazonThe reviews for this post have been edited for length and clarity.
