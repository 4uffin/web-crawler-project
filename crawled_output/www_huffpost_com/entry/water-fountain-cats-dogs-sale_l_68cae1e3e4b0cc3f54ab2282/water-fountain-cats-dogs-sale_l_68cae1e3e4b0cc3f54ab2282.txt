I truly don’t regret to inform you it may be time to replace your pet’s water bowl with a fountain.“Water fountains can deliver a lot of benefits for cats and dogs,” said Dr. Danielle Bernal, a veterinarian who specializes in animal nutrition and works on-staff at Wellness Pet Company. For starters, they provide fresher, cleaner water by “continuously filtering the water, reducing impurities and preventing bacterial growth,” Bernal explained. If you’re surprised to hear this and don’t have one, don’t worry. We found a well-rated fountain on sale right now for just $20!Advertisement
$19.99 at Amazon (originally $24)This auto-on Veken water fountain is ultra easy for you and your pets to deal with and meant to help them have a healthier drinking experience.AmazonAn easy way to promote your pet's overall wellness.Advertisement
It’s made of food-grade materials plus it’s easy to assemble and maintain. You just fill the basin up with water and the fountain’s quiet pump will pull the water up and out in two flow options.There’s a water-level window so you can easily see how much your pet has left to drink and the device also has a blue light that’ll attract your fur babies to it!The Veken water fountain is designed with a 5-step filtration system to combat an issue many pet owners often miss.“...Water bowls that sit out all day can often be breeding grounds for bacteria,” Dr. Carly Fox, a senior veterinarian at New York City’s Schwarzman Animal Medical Center, explained.“This won’t necessarily cause illness in your pets but may deter them from drinking,” she said.The 5-step filtration system on this $20 gem, filters out debris, blocks biofilms likely to develop in sitting water, purifies it, reduces scale formation and keeps the water fresh.The device also cools the water which, Fox notes, “tends to be more appealing to pets, similar to people!”Advertisement
Keeping a water fountain in your home is especially crucial if you own a cat, according to both veterinarians. “For cats especially, their evolutionary heritage often saw them seek out fresh water sources over stagnant ponds for their safety and wellbeing,” Bernal explained. Using a water fountain “mimic[s] that preference,” according to Bernal, and encourages healthy water intake.What makes water fountains especially appealing to cats is their moving water. “The flow of the water makes it instinctually seem fresher [and] cleaner to them, which promotes drinking,” Fox said.Advertisement
Understanding cats’ evolutionary preference for running water is also important because they are more susceptible to kidney disease, Fox noted, which proper hydration can help.Besides helping with kidney disease, water fountains can benefit pets with medical issues like diabetes, frequent urinary infections and blockages, endocrine diseases and more, according to both veterinarians.$19.99 at Amazon (originally $24)Advertisement
Another plus? A water fountain is likely going to be more difficult for your pet to knock over than a water bowl.You likely won’t have to deal with as many messes — like loose water — on your floors, Bernal said. A water fountain is also less likely to run dry than a bowl, especially in multi-pet households, she added.Nab this handy alternative to bacteria-breeding water bowls while it’s on sale. Wanna hunt for more options before your final decision for Fido? Below are more of the best water fountains for dogs and cats for you to consider, rounded based on the aforementioned vets’ recommendations. $19.99 at Amazon (originally $24)1AmazonA sturdy stainless steel fountain for larger dogs and multiple petsThis 7-liter water fountain is specifically designed for larger dogs and multi-pet households thanks to its extra-large water capacity and wide shape. It features multi-layer filtration for fresh, clean water and offers two flow types (a faucet or bubbling mode). Reviewers say it's easy to clean and that they'll "never go back to [a] regular water bowl."Promising review (multi-pet household): "I really like Oneisall Products and I do like this water fountain for the dogs. I have a large golden doodle and a basset hound and I have noticed that they definitely are drinking more water each day. I do wish it had a little deeper dish on top for holding water for the dogs, but it doesn’t seem to have stopped them from drinking regularly. I do recommend purchasing extra filters because with two dogs you will go through them much quicker than the recommendations by the company." — ArkNote: Clip the coupon for an additional 10% off at checkout.Single Fountain: $50 at AmazonSingle Fountain: $50 at Walmart2Chewy and AmazonA dog fountain with an innovative whirlpool design (30% off)Vets recommend using water fountains to encourage your pet to drinks more water, as fountains better align with dogs' and cats' evolutionary instincts.We think Petlibro's 8-liter water fountain is a great option, and it's on sale for less than usual right now.The fountain's whirlpool design helps keep water cool while whisking impurities like dirt and hair down the center into the multi-layer filtration system. Designed for large and medium-sized dogs, the whirlpool also helps minimize over-gulping to reduce indigestion and vomiting, much like a slow feeder. The fountain's anti-splash shield is an extra plus so your floor doesn't get drenched from your pup's water-guzzling.Pro Tip: Amazon only notes this as a 10% off deal BUT per our trackers, this is actually usually around $60, so you're really getting around a 33% discount. Grab it while you can before Amazon realizes the error. $45.99 at amazon (regularly $59.99)3AmazonAn enticing stream fountain with 15,000 5-star ratingsThis falling stream fountain from Petsafe emulates a human-style water fountain (which, if you haven't seen for yourself, dogs love drinking out of). Sized for dogs and cats, the flowing water helps encourage pets to drink while making it easy. Its bottom reservoir keeps more water available, and you can even customize the water flow by adjusting the pump.The piece holds 4.9 liters of water.$55 at Amazon$56 at Walmart$55 at ChewyAdvertisement
4AmazonOr a sleek stainless-steel fountain for smaller dogs and catsI own this Petsafe stainless steel fountain and my cat loves it, preferring it over her other fountain. Its sleek, tower-like design creates a cooling, bubbling effect that encourages her to drink — while looking mod-cool enough to fit into the rest of my decor. (I can attest: Its design consistently earns compliments.)Durable and hefty, its 60-ounce water capacity best serves cats and smaller dogs. Plus, crucially, its deep reservoir ensures that your pet will still have access to water even if the power goes out.$42.95 at amazon5Amazon, TargetA multi-tiered ceramic option ideal for older petsA great pick for senior pets or animals with arthritis due to its elevated design, this ceramic fountain combines two flowing streams with an open bowl that'll keep water available should your power go out. Best used for cats and medium and small dogs, this model holds 70 ounces of water. Promising review: "I really like the design of this fountain. It's attractive and matches my existing white ceramic food bowls. It's ceramic and heavy enough my cat can't knock it over, which is great. Been using it for about a month with no issues. I add water regularly and completely empty and clean it out once a week. Easy to assemble/disassemble." — K$91 at Amazon$90 at Target$90 at WalmartRelatedshoppingDogs PetsCatsThis $4 Cat Toy Is 'Worth Its Weight In Gold' — And Behaviorists Say There's A ReasonThis Affordable Reader-Favorite Device Can Give Pet Owners Peace Of MindGenius Options For When Your Pet Won’t Come Near A ToothbrushThis Seemingly Silly Luxury Is Actually Important For Your Pet's Health Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
