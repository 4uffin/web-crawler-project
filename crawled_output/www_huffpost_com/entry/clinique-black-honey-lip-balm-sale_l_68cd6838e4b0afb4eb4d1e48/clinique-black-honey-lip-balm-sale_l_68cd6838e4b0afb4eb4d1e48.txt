If there were a Mount Rushmore of universally beloved lip products, Clinique’s Black Honey would surely be on it. Whether you call it a tinted lip balm, stain, or, as the brand says, an “Almost Lipstick,” it’s a buildable, lightweight formula that users say suits all wearers. A top seller for HuffPost readers during this past summer’s Amazon Prime Day, we’re excited to see the balm for 50% off — the lowest price we’ve ever seen!$12.50 at Amazon (regularly $25)Advertisement
Black Honey is one versatile beauty product.Created in the 70s, named after the natural sweetener, Black Honey has been back in the public eye, after trending on TikTok. Whether you’re a full makeup wearer or love a Chapstick moment, Clinique’s Black Honey is a versatile crowd pleaser, that’s currently at a pleasing price.“I don’t know [how] Clinique did it, but somehow this lip color looks great on EVERYONE,” one review said. “It’s like a natural lip color, but better. Not warm, not cool, just perfect neutral.” “It looks dark in the tube but somehow goes on your-lips-but-better on EVERY skintone,” one reviewer wrote. ’I’d say it’s a light brown-toned mauve.”Advertisement
AmazonBlack Honey is praised by reviewers for how universally flattering it is. $12.50 at Amazon (regularly $25)It’s widely-known to enhance your natural lip color.According to the brand, Black Honey is Clinique’s number one selling lip color. It’s celebrated for being universally flattering and super buildable, perfect for all-season and all-purpose wear. Whether you’re going for an everyday “no makeup, makeup” look or want a strong color for going out, Black Honey can do it all. Called “barely there” or “your lips but better,” reviewers say this product enhances their natural color and even makes their lips look fuller and plumper.Advertisement
“One swipe adds a hint of color, while a couple more applications adds a dark, wine color that does not overbear,” one reviewer writes. “The best part is you are able to control how much color you want on your lips by limiting the number of applications.” And so many say it’s a certified “cult classic.”Deemed a “cult classic” by reviewers, many mention wearing the product for decades, even getting their kids and grandkids into it. Wearers love the slim, packaging and creamy texture, saying it makes their lips feel hydrated without being sticky or tacky. “I’ve been wearing Clinique Almost Lipstick in Black Honey since high school, and it remains my absolute favorite!” one reviewer said. ”...It goes on so smoothly and effortlessly, you don’t even need a mirror for application.” Some wearers use it on their cheeks to give a blushy glow, making it one of those “everything” products, you’ll be happy to have in your collection. “For someone who doesn’t wear a lot of makeup, this is the only thing I use to add a little color to my face,” another wrote.Advertisement
Read more reviews to see why readers call Clinique’s Black Honey tinted lip balm “the perfect color for all women,” and grab a tube for yourself while it’s on sale. “I have been using this lipstick for about 20 years. My primary use is cheek rouge. It stays on my cheeks most all of the day. It is rich in color yet sheer. For mornings when I am rushed, it is also my lipstick for the day. As I age, I have wondered if this product would creep into wrinkles around my mouth. So far, not! And I am 71 yrs old. I will continue to purchase this product as long as I am able to get it or as long as I am able to wear it.” —
s.wags“I was pleased to see Amazon carried the Clinique Black Honey Almost Lipstick. It is the perfect ‘every day’ touch of color! I keep a tube in my purse for a quick healthy looking touch up! And what a blast from the past, my fellow Clinique fans. ❤️” — Mark Ferchland“I love this product and color. Goes on easily. Looks very natural even in this dark color―and I’m very fair skinned. A perfect every day lipstick that can be layered or topped with a gloss for more impact.” — FashionBizarre$12.50 at Amazon (regularly $25)Want to upgrade your skincare routine? Check out some of our Korean beauty favorites by senior shopping writer Tessa Flores. 1AmazonCosrx snail mucin serum (50% off list price)When we first started hearing about this viral Korean beauty product, we figured the “snail” designation was beauty-speak for something else, but… no, there’s actual snail slime in this stuff and senior shopping writer Tessa Flores can personally confirm that it works incredibly well. (Snail mucin has been used in cosmetics since the 1980s, when Chilean snail farmers observed that when their skin was in contact with snails, it was softer, and cuts seemed to heal faster.) For a few years now, this incredibly hydrating serum has remained a steadfast staple in Flores' and countless others' skin care routines for its ability to address dryness and breakouts and just generally improve the look of skin. Get it for 50% off at Ulta today.$12.50 at Ulta (regularly $25)2AmazonCosrx 6 Peptide skin booster (24% off list price)Dermatologists have previously told HuffPost that certain peptides can boost collagen production and elastin, which in turn can improve skin texture, firmness and the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. This skin booster serum by Cosrx — the makers of the famous snail mucin essence — is packed with six different peptides to plump and renew the skin. The lightweight formula targets other skin concerns, like hyperpigmentation and dryness, and contains a unique ingredient called adenosine, which might have anti-aging benefits.$19 at Amazon (regularly $25)3AmazonA multi-balm stick containing collagen and PDRNThis all-in-one multi balm by Korean-founded brand Kahi can be used all over the face, on the neck, under the eyes and even on the lips. The plumping and dewy formula has a natural fermented jeju oil base that's meant to deeply nourish skin and uniquely contains salmon-derived collagen to target things like volume loss. $22.99 at AmazonAdvertisement
4AmazonIope PDRN Caffeine Shot serumIf you're not always on TikTok, then you might not be familiar with this powerful Korean serum that's been trending for its use of a unique ingredient not commonly found in American skin care formulations: PDRN. It's an anti-inflammatory and tissue-repairing proprietary drug that is normally injected to help improve the overall skin appearance and skin firmness of the recipient. The Iope serum uses a plant-derived version of this ingredient to help with everything from volume loss, the appearance of fine lines and even helps with acne.I have covered countless serums in my many years of beauty reporting, but this one covers all my must-have bases. I've been using it for about six months and have noticed that my skin is significantly more hydrated, glowy and bouncy. I make an effort to put it on my neck lines and it definitely helps to blur them as well. I'm a convert for life!$50 at Amazon5AmazonMedicube PDRN Pink collagen capsule creamThis unique and lightweight moisturizer by Medicube features capsules of salmon DNA-derived PDRN suspended in a rich jelly that promises to be residue-free. PDRN, the latest ingredient for targeting volume loss and reduced elasticity, is accompanied by collagen to plump the skin and hyaluronic acid to boost moisture, and designed to ensure a complexion that's bright, glowing and "glass-like."$19.90 at Amazon (regularly $21.90)6AmazonSoon Jung 2X Barrier Intensive creamParched and compromised skin will benefit from this comforting, shea butter-based facial cream that's packed with skin barrier-strengthening ingredients like panthenol and an oil-based complex.
