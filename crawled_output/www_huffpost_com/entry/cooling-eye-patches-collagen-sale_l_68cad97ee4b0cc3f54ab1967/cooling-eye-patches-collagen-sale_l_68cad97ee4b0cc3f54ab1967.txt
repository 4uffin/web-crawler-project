That’s 50 treatments for refreshing your eyes with a nice, cooling effect, either over coffee or during your morning routine, and for less than $22. Not bad for what another reviewer says gives “a noticeable difference in my under-eye wrinkles!”$21.24 at amazon (regularly $26.95)Advertisement
AmazonThese collagen-loaded eye patches will refresh all kinds of skin.These eye patches are “pure heaven” on tired, puffy eyes, dark circles, under-eye bags and more.Reviewers rave about these under-eye patches, with one saying they “noticeably de-puff under-eye bags and leave the skin feeling deeply hydrated.” Many deem it an excellent, refreshing way to heal tired eyes from a night of studying, smoothing out wrinkles and even cooling down your face after a hot day.Reviewers say they’re easy to use...After cleansing, just apply these patches onto wet skin underneath each eye, gently secure them and keep them on for 20 minutes. When your time’s up, remove the eye patches and pat in the remaining essence. The brand recommends using them as much as twice a day or at least once a week.Advertisement
...and so many adore how they work quickly.Although everyone’s skin is different and consistency will always yield the best results, several happy reviewers say they’ve noticed a difference after a single treatment. Amazon customer Nicole Washington says “there was a SIGNIFICANT difference” after their initial use. “So much so that I switched rooms to look in different lighting because I thought my eyes were tricking me. I wish I had taken a before picture just so I could show you the difference. If that’s the result after one use, I’m super excited to see what happens after a few weeks.”$21.24 at amazon (regularly $26.95)If you tire of tired eyes, grab this 50-pack of under-eye collagen patches while they’re 20% off. Check out more testimonials below if you need further success stories — but be quick, because we’re not sure how long this sale will last.“These 24K Gold Eye Masks are a game-changer for tired eyes. They noticeably depuff under-eye bags and leave the skin feeling deeply hydrated. After just one use, my eyes looked brighter and more refreshed — perfect for mornings after a rough night or before a big event. The cooling effect is soothing, and the gold shimmer adds a touch of luxury. Highly recommended for a quick, effective pick-me-up!” — Rachel Ramos Toledo “I hardly ever give a full 5 star review but these do everything they say they’re going to and do it even better than I expected they would. I’ve been using them 20 minutes everyday for a week and my under eyes are less puffy, my dark circles are reduced, and my crows feet are reduced— for at least 24 hours. It might be longer but I just decided to use them everyday to prolong the enhancement and see if there’s some long-term benefit on any days I end up skipping. I’m back to wearing contact lenses, rather than hide my tired eyes behind my glasses.” —K4Kristina “When buying a new product, I usually wait a few days/weeks before writing a review. This time, there was no need. I’ve recently been dealing with dark under eye circles and they’ve been driving me insane!! I don’t even know when it happened. For over a month I’ve researched and tried different products, but nothing has worked to my liking. I even researched how to determine the cause of the discoloration and which products work best…still no luck.When I decided to try eye patches, my initial thought was to get the more expensive ones with over 30K reviews/purchases. But there was something about the reviews on this one that made me try them. I kid you not, they arrived early this morning. I did my double wash, then put them on. The instructions say to leave on 20 mins, but I started working and forgot they were on my face. They never budged, so it was closer to 45min - 1 hour. I just knew there was going to be irritation, but not only was there no irritation, but there was a SIGNIFICANT difference. So much so that I switched rooms to look in different lighting because I thought my eyes were tricking me. I wish I had taken a before picture just so I could show you the difference. If that’s the result after one use, I’m super excited to see what happens after a few weeks.Needless to say, I’ve added 5 more to my cart. I know everyone’s experience will be different, but at this price, you can’t afford not to try.” —Nicole WashingtonLooking for more solutions for tired eyes? Check out these recommendations from HuffPost Shopping writer Tessa Flores.1AmazonA heated eye massager (20% off)The Renpho eye massager, which has earned itself a formidable TikTok following, claims to alleviate eye strain, reduce eye dryness and more using oscillating pressure, rhythmic percussion massaging and gentle heat. According to reviewers, these wireless goggles can do more than just provide supreme relaxation; they can also make tired eyes look and feel more rested and de-puffed.Amazon Prime members can get this for 20% off right now!Promising Amazon review: "This heat massager is excellent for soothing my tired eyes. I have severe dry eyes due to sjogrens and I stare at a computer all day for work. I just finished similar therapy at the eye doctor and was advised to use eye pads at home that I have to heat in the microwave. This device delivers continual heat as well as massaging all around my eyes. It is fantastic and well worth the money." — Terry L CervenyPrime: $55.99 at Amazon (regularly $69.99)non-prime: $69.99 at amazon2AmazonA de-puffing caffeine-infused eye creamPacked inside this non-greasy gel-cream formula by L'Oréal is hyaluronic acid, a well-known humectant that can draw moisture into the skin and plump away those dryness-related fine lines around the eye. It also features caffeine, a skin care ingredient that shrinks the blood vessels in the skin to reduce swelling, puffiness, redness and dark circles. Promising Amazon review: "I've been using this eye cream for about 3 weeks now and have noticed a big difference in the puffiness and dark circles under my eyes. I use it every morning before applying my makeup and every night before I go to sleep. I have used other eye creams that didn't work, but I definitely see a noticeable difference since I started using this!" — Ashley$12.27 at Amazon3AmazonAn "instant awake" under eye brightenerNot quite a concealer and not quite an eye cream, Catrice's Instant Awake is a beloved under-eye brightener that neutralizes dark circles and skin discoloration to make eyes appear more alert and add a touch of radiance to the skin. It also doesn't hurt that the creamy balm-like formula is enriched with nourishing ingredients like shea butter and hydrating hyaluronic acid. You can shop this in four adaptive shades, which can easily be applied with your fingers, makeup brush or sponge. Promising Amazon reviews: "I love this product! Great value for this price. It has totally replaced concealer for me, which was always so hard to match to my skin tone, but this cream blends very well and instantly makes me look more awake and put-together. I use it every day and have been very happy with the results." — Brooklyn B."I heard about this from a makeup influencer and a must-buy. I figured for the price, why not ? When I saw the pink color, I was worried it wouldn't blend with my more light beige coloring. Wow ! It works small miracles under my eyes. Its smooth and light and easy to blend, while giving light to medium of coverage. I don't wear a lot of makeup, I used a tinted moisturizer as my foundation. This makes my eyes look brighter, more awake and covers the slight darkness under my eyes while not settling in my wrinkles." — Kim$6 at AmazonAdvertisement
4AmazonA viral temporary eye tightenerLast year, dermatologists weighed in on why this temporary tightening eye treatment is so effective at reducing prominent under-eye puffiness and visible sagging in a matter of seconds. It's mostly due to the firming cream's inclusion of sodium silicates, which form a film on the skin that contracts once it’s dried. It essentially pulls the skin tight once the product dries down. There is a learning curve with the application process, according to many users, which is to only apply a very thin layer to avoid any white residue that some reviewers experienced. Promising Amazon reviews: "Seriously, this product WORKS. It is instant and amazing. I'm interested in long-term results, but for a new mom who wants to look more awake and put together, this product is for you." — Emily R"I rarely leave home without this stuff - it's an important part of my makeup.I have pretty significant bags under my eyes that make me look super old and tired, so this is a very important product for me. If I had to choose between this and all other makeup, I'd choose this.I use the amount roughly of a BB (at the most) and it works like a charm. Just be careful not to move your eyes too much until it dries, and no rubbing your eyes during the day!The effect does NOT last - it's like makeup, it lasts until you wash it off (or cry or rub it off).I never want to be without it again! One bottle lasts me months - maybe even a whole year. Well worth the price." — TeacherAmy$38 at Amazon5AmazonInstant whitening eye drops that are truly magicalI'm have been a devout user of Lumify's eye-whitening drops, which I stow in nearly every purse I own for an immediate brightening effect. Two drops of these redness relief drops and my eyes look more open, feel less dry and my exaggerated blood vessels completely disappear for at least five hours. It’s such a confidence booster.The brand claims this formula works differently from other redness-reducing eye drops on the market because they don’t use ingredients that constrict the arteries in your eyes as a way to eliminate redness. Instead, Lumify contains low-dose brimonidine, which only restricts the venules without limiting the flow of oxygen. And yes, contact lens wearers can use these too! Just wait 10 minutes after using the drops before putting in your contacts. Promising Amazon review: "Bright-eyed and bushy-tailed. I use these each morning prior to getting my coffee. After coffee and I begin getting ready, I see the bright whites of my eyes, and I look well rested, helping me to feel more well rested and ready to get going into the day. These drops actually live up to lasting up to 8 hours, they work rapidly and I trust Lumify more than other redness relieving drops for the results these drops produce." — Jeanette$25.06 at AmazonThe Real Deal: We use deal trackers and commerce experience to sift through “fake” hike-and-drop deals and other deceptive sales tactics.
