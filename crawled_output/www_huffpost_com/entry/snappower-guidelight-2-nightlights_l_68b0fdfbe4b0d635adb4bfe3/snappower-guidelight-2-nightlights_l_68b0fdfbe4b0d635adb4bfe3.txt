However, many nightlights come with downsides, from increasing energy bills when they’re always plugged in and turned on, to taking up valuable outlet space. That’s where these SnapPower GuideLights come in to save the day.$24 at AmazonAdvertisement
Available in four colors for three outlet types, these nightlights are actually designed as switchplates with LED lights on the bottom. This design leaves outlets free to plug in other devices, from your phone charger to a lamp.“I’ve got one outlet (2 plugs) in my bathroom. Using a nightlight used one leaving me only one to use,” one reviewer shared. “The cover let me take the nightlight out and got me 2 plugs again. It’s not as cheap as a LED nightlight but is a great nightlight and almost free on my electric bill.”Speaking of your electric bill, the LED lights are energy efficient, with the brand claiming they cost less than 10 cents per year to power (and reviewers have confirmed they saw no changes in their bills). This is partially due to the built-in light sensor, which automatically activates when the area is dark (reviewers mention that the lights come on at dusk and turn off at dawn by themselves, so you don’t have to worry about them using extra energy).Advertisement
Installation can be done in minutes without any tools other than a basic screwdriver. All you have to do is turn off your power at the circuit breaker, unscrew the switchplate on your outlets, and then — once you’ve checked that the screw terminals are clear — use the GuideLight’s prongs to snap it into place. Voila! You’ll just want to make sure you know what type of outlets you have (duplex, GFCI or décor).AmazonThe nightlights are designed with prongs to snap onto your outlets — no tools needed.Reviewers have used these nightlights for outlets on their kitchen counters, in their garages, bathrooms, hallways and more. The sleek appearance gives these a professionally-done look. In fact, shoppers like the nightlights so much, they’re buying them in multiples for all throughout the house.Advertisement
“We bought 2 to try out on our lower wall outlets, to light the path for walking room to room in the dark,” one reviewer wrote. “We were so happy with the light they provided (soft, just enough to light the way, not like an airport runway!) so we bought 7 more.” They added that installation was easy, and they like the auto-on, auto-off functionality.You don’t need a bulky nightlight or professional wiring to get around your house in the dark. Below, check out some more promising reviews for these handy nightlights that are convenient and functional without raising your bills or taking up valuable outlet space.$24 at AmazonAdvertisement
“Does an absolutely terrific job lighting a dark hallway. So much cleaner line than the nightlights I had plugged in previously, just feels like it leaves more space to walk. Love that the light is directed downward. Plenty of light to walk, but doesn’t light upward that would light up the rooms off this hallway such as when I open a door to a dark bedroom. I really like the look, the functionality. Couldn’t be happier with these, what a great product. Easy install.” — GW“This light is perfect for our entry way coming in from the garage. I work night shift and when I get home lights are off but this works great to sit on the bench and take the boots off. I don’t have to use my phone light anymore.” — Twood“It’s great! It may actually be a tiny bit too bright for my preference, but that’s better than too dim! I suspect if my outlet was closer to the floor it’d be perfect. I no longer have to fumble around in the dark or suffer the bright overhead lights for middle of the night personal needs! SUPER EASY to install; took fewer than 2 minutes! Required only a flathead screwdriver and I didn’t have to mess with the breaker box.” — Catherine Normand“Amazing item! It is so brilliant. Identify which type of outlet you have. There is a separate nightlight for each. Unscrew the old plate and place the prongs on each side of the electric outlet. Make sure you have space on both sides before ordering! Then just screw the new plate on. Two minutes? Done. What a perfect nightlight, completely integrated into the wall plate freeing up both outlets and it looks the same as your standard wall plate. Comes on at dusk and off at dawn. This item looks to be built well and is sturdy. The best nightlight ever!” — Low High“I have purchased a few of these faceplates and I do have to say that it works great. It doesn’t quite shine bright like a diamond, but it does indeed provide enough light to see while you’re either being a ninja in the dark, hibernating, or doom scrolling on your phone. I like how it spares up the socket for other items you may wanna plug in and that the fact that these faceplates are flush without any bulky night light hanging off the front. Definitely recommend these fancy stance little jokers for your socket needs.” — Allen$24 at AmazonAdvertisement

Just make sure to "recharge" them by letting them sit in direct sunlight once a month, and they should be reusable for up to two years.Promising review: "These really work for my Smelly Shoe Syndrome. They actually absorb the odor instead of masking it with a weird fruity smell the way sneaker balls do. Can't recommend these enough." — Emily Smith$10 at Amazon6AmazonA collagen mask for your buttReviewers say this butt sheet mask pack of two (one for each cheek) has helped with acne and the appearance of cellulite.

7AmazonThis yellow goop that gets rid of dust on keyboards, car vents and moreDusting is made easier — and more fun — with this reusable yellow goo that you can stick and unstick to keyboards, calculators, car vents, TVs, air conditioners and more. The gel has a lemon fragrance and won't stick to your hands, but will collect the dust with its strong adhesion, turning a boring chore into an activity more reminiscent of playing with slime.Promising review: "Looked super cool in the photos and figured I would give it a try. Air dusters work for big dust clumps but I needed something better that isn't loud such as a can of compressed air. This stuff immediately started working the second I set it on the keyboard. I was done in about 30-45 seconds then put it back in the container. One of the smarter purchases I have made in a while. Girlfriend thought I was weird for buying what looks like Gak (90's kids you know what I mean) but this stuff just works." — Kenny$6 at Amazon8AmazonA deodorizer for your fridge to get rid of bad odorsIf you can't get rid of a funky smell in your fridge, no matter what you do, you may want to try a deodorizer like this one.

She placed it in and I went to visit 3 days later, no sign of the odor AT ALL. Absolutely amazing! 50-star recommendation!" — GrnEyesAmyZ$22 at Amazon9Amazon, AmazonAn adorable garlic crusher that looks like DraculaGarlic is a good addition to nearly any meal, but mincing it can be a chore.

Best of all, you don't only have to use this ergonomic grinder for garlic; it can also work with ginger, herbs and other spices.Promising review: "Bought this on a whim when I was browsing one day. We use a LOT of garlic in our house. I cheat and use the chopped kind in the jar in a pinch. But let's be honest, it ain't the same. For full delightful effect ya gotta use fresh. And anything that makes that easy is gold in my book. Well-designed, a snap to clean, and takes up very little space. Come to think of it, this is so darn cute I think I might keep it out.

13AmazonA cactus toilet plunger and brush setA toilet plunger and brush can take away some of the aesthetic charm of a bathroom, but they don't have to: Enter this cactus plunger and brush set, which act both as decor and as cleaning tools. Stored in the same two-compartment holder, the plunger has a commercial-grade rubber suction cup, and the strong bristles on the brush can assist in cleaning tough stains. .Promising review: "Are these more expensive than a normal plunger and toilet brush set? Yes. Are they worth it? YES!These are really cute in my bathroom and it adds a lot of fun and character to both the bathroom and to your mundane toiletry tools. The handles (green stems) are made of plastic and have a slightly ribbed texture and actually have some weight to it - they aren't light. The toilet brush head can twist off and is replaceable. Aesthetic and functionality are two thumbs up!" — Nate$26 at Amazon14AmazonA nose wax kit reviewers say is weird, but worksGross but effective, this nose wax kit comes with 100 grams of wax beads, 10 mustache protectors, 30 applicators, 10 paper cups and a measuring cup. Using the kit can help you remove pesky nasal hairs at the root, ensuring you don't have to trim them as often (the brand says results should last four to six weeks).Promising review: "So easy to use! I did the pour hot water in cup and warm beads method. Kind of like melting chocolate. Well it was ready to pull in two minutes. The wax won’t be super hard but it was cooled completely so I knew it held the hairs right. Then straight down in one strong tug. Pinch the nose above to make it almost painless. I didn’t feel much but you can hear it rip from your skin and that is weird. You’ll basically freak yourself out the first time till it’s happens and then think it’s not a big deal. The bad videos online are because they shove it all the way up with too much wax." — Izzy$17 at Amazon15AmazonA fun soup ladle shaped like the Loch Ness monsterBring a bit of fun to your soup pot with this Nessie ladle that has four little feet it can stand on and has earned over 7,000 5-star ratings. The ladle comes in three sizes and two colors. It's also dishwasher-safe, BPA-free and heat-resistant. Nessie is an easy and functional way to add some color and whimsy to your kitchen, and seeing her head sticking out of the pot has made many reviewers laugh. It's plenty cute, but Nessie's height also prevents the annoyance of a too-short spoon falling into the food you're cooking.Promising review: "Nessie the ladle is just one of those things you've gotta have in your kitchen. Besides putting a smile on your face every time you see her, she's quite the conversation starter too. When I first looked at her up close, I wondered - Is this really going to work? She seemed ...well ... short (or at least shorter than I expected). Then I put her in a pot - and she sits there, staring at me, like she owns the place! This was a pure fun purchase that I won't regret. Bet you won't either :) Highly recommended." — Dawn L.$20 at AmazonAdvertisement

Rub it in and let it dry and you are good to go. Best product I have ever used. While it seems expensive for a small tube, because you use so little it is really a great value.
