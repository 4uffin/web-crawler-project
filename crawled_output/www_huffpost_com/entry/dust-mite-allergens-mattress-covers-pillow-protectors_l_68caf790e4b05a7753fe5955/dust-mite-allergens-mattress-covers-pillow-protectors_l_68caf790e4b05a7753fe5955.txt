We know — gross. While it’s impossible to completely get rid of these microscopic creatures, there is a way to protect your bed and reduce allergy symptoms: mattress and pillow protectors.Mattress covers: $33+ at Amazon (regularly $35+)Pillow covers: $15+ at AmazonAdvertisement
Experts named allergy bed covers as one of the ways you can get rid of dust mites in that previous HuffPost story. Our editors’ pick are these mattress and pillow covers by Four Seasons Essentials, which have earned 10,000 and 9,000 5-star ratings on Amazon, respectively.Hypoallergenic and zippered to completely cover your mattress and pillows on all sides, the covers create an impenetrable (but still breathable) barrier between your bed and you, so no dust mites can get through and you can sleep without worrying about allergic reactions from the bugs.And according to shoppers, these do the trick: “I have allergies and before and before making this purchase, I was constantly washing my pillow to eliminate dust and other allergens,” said one reviewer of the pillow protectors. “Now with this soft protective cover I sleep through the night without any nasal stuffiness. Strongly recommend.”Advertisement
Another reviewer of the mattress protector agrees. “We bought this twin size for our daughter who suffers from allergies. She would wake every morning with goopy eyes,” they wrote. “This mattress protector is great! Nothing gets through. There is a tab over the zipper to ensure air-tightness, and you can even see the air pillowing up under the sheet. Now our daughter wakes with clear eyes. This gets my highest rating!”AmazonMany reviewers say they don't even notice the covers are there because of how breathable and noiseless they are.Not only are the covers great for allergens, but they have other practical uses too: They’re waterproof, meaning they can protect your bed from spills and accidents, and can also keep out dust and pet dander. The covers are machine-washable too, so they’re easy to clean as needed.Advertisement
You might be hearing this and imagining a crinkly plastic material that makes tons of noise when you sleep on it, but these are made with polyester and a polyurethane lining that’s stretchable and noiseless. “I was initially worried they might be crinkly because they’re waterproof, but I haven’t noticed any noise at all,” one reviewer wrote about the pillow covers. “In fact, I don’t even notice they’re on my pillow. They feel just as comfortable as a regular cover.”You can grab the mattress covers in 12 sizes, from twin to split California king, while the pillow covers come in 11 sizes, from standard to body size. (The pillows are sold in packs of two, except for the body size.) Below, check out some more promising reviews for how these covers are convenient, comfortable and — most importantly — stave off allergic reactions to creepy, crawly dust mites in your bed.Mattress covers: $33+ at Amazon (regularly $35+)Pillow covers: $15+ at AmazonAdvertisement
“10/10 would recommend this for anyone suffering from dust mite or feather allergies (if you have a down pillow). Not only are these soft and breathable, but they also really blocked the allergens I’m used to dealing with all night. I expected them to be plastic like and awful, but the texture is awesome. I have old down pillows and a severe allergy to dust mites/feathers (just found out about this so don’t judge me). The first night I used these, I honestly forgot they were even there and woke up feeling great for the first time in forever. No drainage all night and didn’t wake up hating my life from allergy symptoms.” — Katherine Hufford“I did a lot of research and finally decided on these and don’t regret it one bit! We got them in and gave them a wash before using them and we put them on the pillows with no problem. The fit is great. Not too tight, not super loose but enough room that it’s easy enough to get a regular pillow in there.No plastic rustling sounds, no crazy air bubbles in the case, no hot feeling from the fabric being under my pillowcase. (We slipped our regular pillowcases over these for looks) Overall i’m just thrilled with them. We have allergies and can rest easy knowing dust mites won’t be making their home in our pillows with these on there!” — Mountain Man“I lover everything about this product. It was easy to wash, easy to install and I can already feel the different on my children’s allergies.My children are allergic to dust mites and every morning they used to get up with a stuffy nose and now that I have covered the beds with this protector, they feel better. They don’t have a stuffy nose anymore. Seeing your kids wake-up feeling great in the morning is a PRICELESS GIFT!!” — Customer“This is well made and was easy to put on the full size mattress. I love that it doesn’t feel like plastic under the sheets. The soft exterior adds breathability. Glad I chose this one.” — Anita J. Lee“This pillow cover is 5-star quality. Super soft and looks silky. It really protects the pillow, is soft and doesn’t make any noise. You never know it is there, but it extends the life of the pillow, making it a great value for your money. I have reordered it several times.” — Mark W.Mattress covers: $33+ at Amazon (regularly $35+)Pillow covers: $15+ at AmazonAdvertisement
See more pillow protectors below, from previous reporting by former HuffPost shopping writer Haley Zovickian:1Probably the best affordable pillow protector on the marketThis bestselling two-pack, which has 24,000 five-star ratings on Amazon, is likely the best you’ll find at an affordable price point. Its knitted jersey material is so soft and comfortable that Amazon reviewers report they forget the protectors are even on their pillows. A TPU (thermoplastic polyurethane) coating covers all sides of the pillow protector to ensure they’re completely waterproof, while their double-hemmed stitching and zip-closure seals off allergens and bugs. Plus, they’re available in a range of neutral and bold colors to keep this bedding addition feeling fun and not simply utilitarian.Grab a two-pack in eight sizes, including options for body pillows and toddler pillows.$7+ at Amazon (regularly $9+)2AmazonA quiet, soft, reviewer-favorite option with 12,000 5-star Amazon ratingsWith over 12,000 5-star ratings on Amazon, these waterproof quilted protectors are a tried-and-true option for pillow protector loyalists. They’re impressively durable yet soft, and only get softer with time, according to one reviewer. Their auto-lock zippers ensure they stay secure over your favorite pillows. Their most important feature? They’re quiet: “They do NOT sound crunchy like the old school plastic covers,” one reviewer writes. As a result, you won’t hear (or feel) the pillow protector while you’re resting your head — a quality so impactful that reviewers’ finicky toddlers sleep well on them, too. Plus, they're machine washable!$10+ at Amazon3AmazonAn option you can wash on hotThese AllerEase protectors come highly recommended, with a 4.7 out of 5 rating on Amazon.

With locking zippers and soft, wrinkle-resistant, moisture-wicking fabric, they create a seal over your pillow so nothing will get through to your pillowcase or your skin, with a second high-range laminate lining underneath the primary fabric to make sure that nothing gets through.
