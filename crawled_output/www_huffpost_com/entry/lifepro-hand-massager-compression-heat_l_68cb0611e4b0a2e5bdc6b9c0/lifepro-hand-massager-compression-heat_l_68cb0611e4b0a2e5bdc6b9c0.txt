Whether it’s typing at work, cooking dinner, or mindlessly doom scrolling in bed, our fingers, thumbs, and wrists rarely get a break. I’ve even coined my own term for it: “tech thumb.” You know that dull, achy pain radiating from the pad of your thumb after a few hours of swiping endlessly through social media? Yeah, that. Add in the carpal tunnel I’ve developed from typing and clicking around on my computer all day, and by the evening my wrists are practically begging for relief.$70 at Amazon$70 at LifeProAdvertisement
That’s where the LifePro hand massager comes in. This compact, heat-and-compression device with 6,500+ Amazon reviews and a 4-star rating has quickly become my go-to when I need to unwind and soothe sore joints. Unlike some bulkier hand massagers that rely on roller balls, this one uses air compression and vibration to gently hit pressure points in the palm, fingers, and wrist. The result is a less aggressive but surprisingly effective massage that feels both therapeutic and restorative.AmazonThe device is useful for different types of hand pain.$70 at Amazon$70 at LifeProAdvertisement
Equipped with a sleek LED display, you can toggle the $70 hand massager between five different massage modes, two vibration settings, and five varying intensity levels. Whether I’m just looking for light relaxation while watching TV or more targeted pain relief after a heavy typing day, I can usually find a setting that matches my needs. The built-in heat function is an added bonus—it feels like slipping my hands into a warm compress that melts away stiffness and tension.This isn’t just about relaxation, either. The LifePro hand massager is designed to support circulation, reduce inflammation, and even aid in faster recovery. If you deal with arthritis, carpal tunnel, or general hand fatigue — just a 10-minute session with a hand massager makes a noticeable difference in mobility and comfort.AmazonYou can easily customize the intensity of your massage.Advertisement
Another plus: it’s rechargeable and portable. I can easily move it from my desk to the couch, and it doesn’t take up much space when stored away. I personally like using it at night while catching up on a show — it feels like my own little self-care ritual. If you’re tired of living with “tech thumb,” sore wrists, or stiff fingers, the LifePro hand massager is absolutely worth considering. Keep scrolling to see some reviews from other satisfied customers or just add this to your own cart for some instant pain relief.

“This product has helped my hardworking hands. The massage and heat are very soothing. I think the circulation in my hands has improved since using this because I rarely wake with numbness in my hands. I am thankful I found this and tried it.” — Linda Potter“I work in commercial rubber flooring and this thing is a game changer for healing. In my line of work, I use a concrete trowel for hours each day, applying significant amount of pressure to wooden handle for up to six hours a day. This puts serious strain on your palm, finger joints and wrist. After using this [sic] thing, I noticed a huge difference. It’s speeds up my recovery and gets me ready for the following day. I genuinely love it and recommend it to anyone who does repetitive work for hours on end. Oh yea, and those massage balls, they provide a lot of relief for the finger joints” — fausto armenta“I bought this as a gift for my mom since she works with her hands all the time. She loves it and I also love it too! I work as a server and my wrists hurt most nights and this massager helps with the pain so much. I love how much pressure it puts on my wrists I feel so much relief. I highly recommend this for anyone who works with their hands!” — Casey Yu“It helps relieve the pain in my hands. I love that it has different settings of pressure plus the heat and vibrating option.” — Rebecah Gautier“I got this because I crochet a lot so the thumb and wrist get to hurting. This is pretty great and strong, reminds me of a blood pressure cuff, it has tons of springs inside under fabric that squeezes and hits all the spots. After I feel like j have a lot more circulation. It leaves some squeeze dots all over for a bit but the refill is fantastic!” — McKay$70 at Amazon$70 at LifeProAdvertisement
If your hand pain is persistent, you may find some relief with these other products that reviewers say help their hand and wrist discomfort, previously rounded up by senior shopping writer Tessa Flores:1AmazonA penetrative concentrate creamThe Penetrex recovery cream is possibly one of the most impressively reviewed pain-relief topicals on Amazon that features a concentrated blend of natural ingredients. It's a non-greasy and sensitive skin-friendly formula containing arnica and vitamin B6 to soothe sore and achy muscles without the burning or freezing sensation of other numbing creams.Promising Amazon review: "Penetrex works for me. I have tried many different pain relieving creams and really believed a topical cream could not eliminate pain. Some products have a lot of Menthol that distracts from the pain for a while. I broke my wrist in 2015 and have 10 metal pins in my wrist. My hand, as well as my wrist, are frequently painful. I think some arthritis is developing. I am so thankful to have found Penetrex. When my hand or wrist starts hurting, I rub in a small amount of Penetrex and the pain goes away. I have not timed how long it takes. I just know if I want the pain to stop, I use Penetrex and not long after, I realize the pain is gone. I keep a jar at home and at work. I will not be without it, so I hope the company stays around for a very long time. Penetrex is not sticky or greasy, it rubs in completely like a hand cream or lotion. It has a mild fragrance, not a strong odor like some sports creams. I was introduced to electrode therapy and ultrasound during my physical therapy sessions for my wrist. I purchased both for home use. Penetrex works better than either of those therapies. I recommend you try it. It may not work the same for everyone and every type of pain, but it is worth a try." — Rita Berry$17 at Amazon2AmazonA pair of copper-infused compression glovesThe idea behind compression gloves is that they can improve circulation, reduce swelling and restrict the build-up of excess fluid, which may cause aching and soreness in joints. These fingerless and machine-washable gloves are infused with copper the company claims will reduce inflammation, however, the evidence supporting that particular claim is limited.Promising Amazon reviews: "Life changing. I wear these gloves every night and they have helped tremendously with the pain in my hands. They do not compress too much, are very lightweight and I can even wear them when I'm typing. I'm ordering a second pair soon so I'm never without them!" — Rosa"In the past several months, I have had severe swelling in my feet, arms and knees. Because of a diagnosis of arthritis, I purchased these to help me sleep and they have completely worked. I used to wake up throughout the night in pain from my fingers and in the morning, they were extremely painful. Once I started wearing these at night, I slept through the night and my hands worked and felt great in the morning. I had tried other brands of gloves which didn't help as much and were hot to wear (I live in the south where it gets rather warm). These are thin and NOT hot to wear. I would definitely recommend trying them. I've always worn medium gloves but I had to get a Large in these. I'm sure it's because of the swelling." — CDW$25 at Amazon3AmazonOr a classic pair that also keeps hands warmThese fingerless high-cotton fiber gloves promise targeted compression for maximum pain relief. Aside from reducing swelling and soothing joints, many reviewers claim that another benefit of these gloves is that they keep hands warm. Find them in three sizes. Promising Amazon review: "I’ve had a pair of compression gloves for years, but the seams finally split. I found these new compression gloves to be the perfect replacement. They 'snug up' in all the right places and give relief to my painful arthritic hands. The wrist fit is just right (some gloves gap in this area). I can use the computer, walk the dog, write, and more with the fingertips open. These are well made and flex perfectly. Absolutely great!" — Gold Girl$16 at AmazonAdvertisement
4AmazonA hand strengthening setThis physical therapy-inspired set is aimed and strengthening weakened hands and wrists to reduce pain. Reviewers claim that consistently using these tools has helped reduce pain related to carpal tunnel, tendentious and overuse. The set includes two different gadgets in three different resistances that allow for a variety of strengthening exercises. Check the product page for additional coupons and promo codes.Promising Amazon reviews: "Works very well for tendonitis and wrist pain. I bought these items because my chiropractor recommended them due to my left hand suffering tendonitis due to rowing while my right hand suffered wrist pain from typing. I used them daily to strengthen both my hands and at first it was hurting the muscles. However, as I am slowly healing my grip started getting stronger as well. Moving forward and I am now in my 4th month of being treated along with every 2 weeks seeing a Chiropractor, I did not stop using these small gadgets for muscle strengthening. In my experience...it works." — Rockit Mobile LLC"Really helped my hand heal after a boxer's fracture. It has also lessened my carpal tunnel pain. Highly recommend for people with hand or wrist pain/injuries." — A Guy from New York City$8 at Amazon5AmazonA one-handed myofascial release massagerThe Rolflex rolling massager tool provides myofascial-release massage on areas like the hands, wrists and forearm — without the need for a professional masseuse or anyone else for that matter. Its clamp-style design and adjustable compression work to target key pressure points and promote circulation. Promising Amazon review: "I just received my new roller an hour ago and had to write this review right away because this is the greatest therapy device I have ever used!! I've suffered from severe carpal tunnel and trigger finger for years and after 30 minutes of learning how to use this new roller I am already in less pain/tension. It's incredible the pressure points I can focus on and relieve in my hands, wrists and forearms! I felt the tension relief all the way up my neck and through the back of my shoulders just from massaging my forearms! This product is worth every penny! Quality materials and craftsmanship and I love the rubber disc on the bottom that allows you to position the roller just about anywhere comfortably with no slippage. Great product!!" — Amazon customer$80 at Amazoon6AmazonA freezable gel therapy gloveMade by TheraIce, the maker of our beloved headache relief cap, this wrist and hand wrap uses the same combination of cold therapy and compression to reduce pain and swelling. It has a seamless and slip-on design and is filled with a soft gel that can either be frozen or heated. It's available in two sizes, but most reviewers say that it runs small so it might be a good idea to size up. Promising Amazon reviews: "OMG! I just got my TheraICE hand ice packs and they are incredible. I was diagnosed with De Quervain's tenosynovitis a couple of weeks ago and have struggled with regular ice packs. The pain is so uncomfortable and ice packs just don't accommodate your wrist. I just got my delivery today, put them in the freezer for a couple of hours and now have such relief. Wonderful product! Thank you!" — Mary Lee Wiley"Fantastic product. Relieves pain in the best way. Very, very soft and light weight. I have a very small wrist and hand and got the small. It is a pretty stretchy but form fitting like a hug. It is heavenly for my wrist pain and really helps." — Margauxr$12 at AmazonAdvertisement
7AmazonA wireless and ergonomic trackball mouseInstead of moving your entire wrist and thumb to control this wireless mouse, the ergonomic design allows full control of your cursor only using this smooth-rolling trackball to reduce muscle strain. The trackball and contours of the mouse keep hands and fingers in a natural position, while the brand promises exceptional accuracy of cursor movement, without any lagging. Promising Amazon review: "I had a Kensington trackball back in the day, that was about the size of a billiard ball. This is a modern take on that idea, and I'm glad I'm back to having a trackball. I'd been experiencing some wrist pain, and my old mouse was also starting to have sporadic issues, so I started looking for an alternative. I decided to try this wireless trackball with my iMac using Bluetooth, and it's been a good change. I also got a silicone mouse pad with a wrist rest to keep my wrist at the right height. I like the thumb control ball, and where the buttons are located. The angle is good with my hand on the mouse. I've only had to charge it one time so far, it lasts for a long time on a charge. There are also some good color choices for the trackball, I really like the burnt orange color. All in all, I'm really happy with this trackball, and I wouldn't hesitate to buy another one. Recommended." — K Smith$34+ at Amazon8AmazonAnd an ergonomic mousepad with gel restSpeaking of ergonomic mice, this mousepad has an ergonomic wrist rest filled with a soft gel to keep the wrist elevated, and supported and prevent repetitive motions that can lead to conditions like carpal tunnel. The rest of the mouse pad's surface Is made with a smooth Lycra fabric so mice roll seamlessly over the surface.Check the product page for additional coupons and promo codes.Promising Amazon review: "I was having a lot of hand and wrist pain after being on the computer all day for work. As soon as I started using this it started to go away and the pain is completely gone now! Great product." — akart$10 at Amazon9AmazonAn electrode TENS unitAn orthopedic surgeon previously told HuffPost that the theory behind TENS units is that they stimulate the superficial nerves in the body that exhaust some of the pain fibers that typically cause discomfort around a joint. This model is relatively affordable, has over 81,450 5-star Amazon ratings and features five therapy modes of custom stimulation. The attachments can adhere to areas like the wrists, hand and between fingers to help with conditions like carpal tunnel and arthritis.Promising Amazon review: "Has helped my carpal tunnel! I’ve read both the good and the bad reviews and this is one of those things that you must try out for yourself and make your own decision of whether or not it works for “you.” So far, it has worked for me. My carpal tunnel pain has been slowly resurfacing by simply using my cell phone and cooking. I love to write especially Calligraphy but haven’t done so due to sharp needle-stabbing pain on my lower hand and wrist. I decided to give this a try since my therapist would set me up with one of these at their office. So far, it’s provided relief. I’m not one to ingest pain medication (or any drug for that matter). It is primarily for that reason why I decided to give this a try. I recommend you read up on your particular symptoms prior to making this purchase. You can also take advantage of Amazon’s extraordinary service and 'try it out.' You have nothing to loose. If anything you might find relief and we can all attest that living pain-free is the best way to live." — E from Cali$39 at AmazonAdvertisement
10AmazonAn electric heated hand massagerThis cordless hand and wrist massager claims to combine heat with air compression and shiatsu-style kneading to relieve soreness, stiffness, numbness and joint pain. You can choose between six heat settings up to a soothing 107 degrees and five massage modes, including a gentle acupressure therapy mode.Promising Amazon review: "This Lunix LX3 hand massager is a lifesaver! I suffer from hand pain, and this massager provides incredible relief. It's surprisingly strong and really gets deep into the muscles and joints. The heat and compression features add to the therapeutic experience. It's truly the perfect hand massager, and I highly recommend it to anyone with hand pain or just looking for a relaxing hand massage" — ChrisChan$119+ at Amazon11AmazonA topical anti-inflammatory gelVoltaren gel is a topical anti-inflammatory that can be applied to affected joints and doesn't require a prescription. According to a rheumatologist who previously spoke with HuffPost, Voltaren can be a good option for patients who otherwise have a contraindication to systemic anti-inflammatories since only 15% of its active ingredients get absorbed systemically. The non-steroidal and hydrating gel imparts a cooling sensation when applied and can help reduce stiffness and aches and improve mobility. Promising Amazon review: "I suffer from stiff fingers & wrists and this wonderful product really helps! The first plus, the company has put a larger screw-off cap for ease in removing the tube for those of us who have arthritis pain and find those little caps are difficult to hold on to. Second, it is not creasy and dries completely with just a few rubs. I put it on like hand lotion and it rubs right in. Third, I'd say within 15 to 20 minutes I start to feel relief in my hands and it will last a full day. Fourth, there is no strong order that lingers. I've tried lots of things that get hot, or cold and make you smell like a medicine cabinet but they don't relieve the burning and aching in my hands & wrists. Highly recommended and I will purchase again!!" — Grandma J2-pack: $32 at AmazonSingle tube: $23 at Amazon12AmazonAn ergonomic wireless keyboardA few notable design features of this keyboard make it ergonomic and potentially pain-relieving, according to the over 8,200 reviewers who gave it five stars. It has a split keyset and an integrated wrist rest, which help keep hands and arms in a neutral position and minimize repetitive stress. It wirelessly connects to your monitor of choice either through Bluetooth or using your Wi-Fi. Promising Amazon review: "Since I started working from home I was using a base model keyboard that was provided with the computer. I noticed that my hands were a bit closer while typing and were angled a bit oddly. After a while, my hands developed the initial pains of Carpal Tunnel. I remembered the keyboard I had at the office was a split keyboard but had not realized how expensive that one was. I figured that I could purchase this one to see if that would help. It did. Within a month of using the nerves in my wrist no longer are pinched and I haven't suffered any more numbing tingling sensation in a long time. The arrows and the other keys above them do take a bit to get used to since they have a slightly different configuration but once you get used to them a great purchase."— A. Borunda$80 at AmazonAdvertisement
13AmazonA pair of microwavable hand mitsSoft, plush and oh so soothing, these microwavable therapy mits completely envelop hands to deliver the paid-reducing wonders heat. Each one is filled with a blend of millet, flaxseeds and clay beads that retain heat for up to 30 minutes or can be chilled to offer cold therapy. The soft covers are removable and machine-washable. Promising Amazon reviews: "I have rheumatoid arthritis, the disease causes a lot of pain my hands. These mitts are HEAVEN! They heat quickly and hold on the heat for a while. They cover up past my wrist, which was important to me. I can't wait to pop them back in the microwave to recharge that heat." — Divaliciously"Helps with hand pain. Cold does not last as long as warm but both work well to relieve pain and swelling of multiple areas of hand and wrist." — Red Vixen$30 at Amazon14AmazonA supportive wrist braceAmazon reviewers of other products intended for pain relief mentioned Mueller wrist braces as a key component in their hand and wrist therapy. It turns out that the supportive design is a highly rated favorite for its ability to reinforce weak or injured wrists and prevent even more straining. The brace is fully adjustable with Velcro and is made from a breathable mesh material. The braces are sold individually, for the left and right hand.Promising Amazon review: "I initially chose this wrist brace when I was having some postpartum joint issues. I was in terrible pain and so I went on Amazon and chose what looked like the best reviewed, least invasive brace, and let's be honest, I chose the one that would show up that night for delivery. I have pretty bad circulation and usually anything that's tight on my arm makes my hand start falling asleep fairly quickly. I wore this brace for around 3 days straight (I only took it off when I needed to get my hands wet) and I never felt like my hand was going to sleep. I was surprised. After 3 days of resting my wrist joint, my wrist felt 98% better and I stopped continuous use. I only had one problem with it. There are some seams on the inside of the brace (pictured) that on occasion would make me feel a little itchy. They didn't bother me too badly, but if you are sensitive to those kind of things, maybe look for something without that issue. I'm really happy with the product and the result it gave. I am glad to have it for potential future use." — Annika R$17 at Amazon15AmazonA thumb spica splintThis breathable brace stabilizes the thumb while giving free range of movement to all other digits. It uses velcro straps and comes in three sizes for the best fit possible.Promising Amazon review: "Absolutely the best! For trigger thumb, I have gone through 4 different supports in the past 8 months. None of the supports fully stabilized like this spica support from Solid. Because of poor stabilization from other supports my CMC joint was becoming more inflamed with greatly increased pain. My fifth attempt at obtaining a good support is NUMER ONE: Solid Thumb Spica Splint. Adjustable to a perfect fit, comfortable, pain relief — Finally! Do not look any further! This is it!" — Jeanine Walters$13 at AmazonAdvertisement
