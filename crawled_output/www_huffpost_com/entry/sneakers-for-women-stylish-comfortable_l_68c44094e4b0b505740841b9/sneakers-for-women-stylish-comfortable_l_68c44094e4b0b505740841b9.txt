Shoe PalaceA pair of Sambas with an animal spinHuffPost executive editor Kate Palmer has these cheetah print Adidas Samba sneakers and loves them. They're a fun twist on a classic, elevating this popular casual sneaker. Sambas will never go out of style, they are a lovely low-profile sneaker that is easy to style with everything from jeans to a dress or skirt. They've been around since the 1950s and aren't going anywhere anytime soon. You can get them in sizes 5-15 in a range of color combinations. Promising review: "LOVEEE! They’re so cute. I can wear with jeans to dress down. I can also wear with wide leg slacks that are the right length to dress up for work. They’re so cute so comfortable. The sole is perfect, not too thin, not too thick. I’m definitely buying more and different colors." — I10710 $104+ at Farfetch$110 at Adidas$110 at FootlockerDSWA pair of HuffPost reader-beloved sneakersMy colleague Greta Geiselman joins the chorus of many women who love these Brooks Ghost 16 sneakers. According to previous reporting, where older models of the Ghost have soles infused with air, the 16 model uses nitrogen to be extra lightweight and make you feel like you're floating. An extra-grippy rubber outsole provides durability and traction on uneven ground. And the enhanced air mesh upper promises breathability, while still offering a secure fit. Best, the sole is specially designed to lessen extra pressure on the balls of your feet as you walk or run. You can get it in a few different colors in sizes 5-13 and multiple widths.Brooks frequently updates this bestselling sneaker, and the most currently iteration is the Ghost 17, which you can get at Zappos in men's and women's sizing. Because the 16 is an older model, you might find limited availability at the retailers below. Promising review: "I absolutely love the ghost 16 neutral. I’ve searched for years for a comfortable all day shoe, no matter if it’s working those long 12 hour shifts, long walks or runs or just to wear daily no matter the reason. THIS is the shoe. I highly recommend because my painful feet no longer hurt me as long as I wear these daily. I will be purchasing more colors only in the GHOST 16 NEUTRAL. Thank you Brooks for making a shoe that truly helps alleviate pain.” — Jessica$99+ at Amazon (regularly $140)$100 at DSW (regularly $140)VivaiaVivaia's delightful sneakerinasI am a longtime fan of Vivaia shoes; they're comfortable and surprisingly stylish.
