I felt like I was in an infomercial but without the B.S. One sponge removed all the greasy, oily, dirty hand marks in our apartment, the worst of which were built up around the door knobs and door jams. I cleaned some of the worst browning marks on my doors in under 10 seconds with one sponge and some warm water, and it makes a HUGE difference." — Marisa P. Get a 20-pack from Amazon for $15.2www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comA Baseboard Buddy that easily removes dust and debris from crevicesPromising review: "Buy it NOW. Honestly, I had huge reservations for this thing. Yet another miracle cleaning tool that will break or bend or something. I was so wrong. It was easy to put together and I sprayed it with Mean Green and went to the baseboards. No more kneeling and no broken back. This thing is amazing. It is durable and the pad is super absorbent. I am so happy. I can't wait to do the rest of the house!" — artgirlGet it from Amazon for $25. 3amazon.com, amazon.comA no-scrub Wet & Forget cleanerPromising review: "This stuff is excellent. It performs as promised, it has a very nice scent, no fumes, and leaves shower clean with no scrubbing actually necessary. It is very easy to apply and rinse off. It is designed very well, with squirting spout separate from the large container and attached by a longish tube, so you don't have to hold the heavy container while applying the product. I've been using it for quite a while now, and I love it. I highly recommend it." — Stephanie MartinGet it from Amazon for $21.Advertisement
4amazon.comA dryer vent cleaning system if you've noticed clothes requiring an extra dry cyclePromising review: "This thing worked AMAZING. I got a TON of lint out of my vent piping, my dryer works better now and runs cooler, and drying time has been reduced. I was amazed at how much lint build-up there was!" — Allen L GroomsGet it from Amazon for $17+.Advertisement
5amazon.comA non-abrasive Bar Keepers Friend cleansing and polishing powderPromising review: "We've all seen products that claim to be the 'best' at whatever they are intended for. All too often, we are sadly disappointed by a product that falls far short of these audacious claims. Bar Keepers Friend is not one of these products. While I'm no barkeep, I can honestly state that I am impressed with the cleaning power of this product. I've used it on my glass-top stove, on metal pots and pans, and even some of those heavily stained aluminum baking pans that tend to turn brownish after use. This product cleaned them all...and with very little effort on my part. I tend to sprinkle just a little on whatever I am going to clean, and then, using a clean paper towel or other nonabrasive cloth with a bit of moisture, I then wipe the area until the stains lift up and out. A few extra passes to remove any remaining cleaning powder/product and I'm off to other chores. I seldom have to use this, but when I do, it is quick and efficient." — Steven M. Get a pack of two from Amazon for $9.6amazon.com, amazon.comA pumice cleaning stone capable of removing calcium, lime, and hard water stainsPromising review: "I have a 19-year-old master bathroom toilet that had accumulated some nasty stains over time, and regular toilet brushes and cleaning products just would not remove them. I decided to try this pumice stone, and it worked like a charm! Given the nature and severity of the stains, it required some elbow grease. But 10 minutes later, I have a new-looking bowl, and I see no signs of scratching." — Happy RetireeGet it from Amazon for $14.Advertisement
7amazon.com, amazon.comA multi-purpose OxiClean powder for getting grease off of range hood filtersPromising review: "I use very hot water, add this stuff, and put the range hood filter in it. After about 30 minutes, there's already a lot of grease and dirt floating in the water by itself. If you shake it vigorously, even more grease comes off! The effect is really noticeable! I'm so excited; I can finally have a clean kitchen! And this isn't just for cleaning the kitchen; it can also wash clothes. It feels like it can do everything!!" — NamelessGet it from Amazon for $15.8amazon.comA stainless-steel cleanerPsst, this stainless-steel cleaning spray also comes with a handy dandy microfiber cloth. Promising review: "My appliances have never looked better. I was so frustrated trying to get my stainless steel refrigerator clean without streaks. This is the best thing I have found, easy to use and no streaks! So glad I took a chance." — Nancy a Williams Get it from Amazon for $20.9amazon.com, amazon.com, amazon.comA lint roller that's especially excellent for collecting dog hairPromising review: "I'm a fur-mom of five cats and two dogs, so I know all about animal hair on everything. And I was very skeptical about this purchase, but I figured why not? Nothing else is working very well. Holy moly. I have a well-loved old cat tree that I've tried vacuuming and lint rollers, and had finally resolved myself to it being cat hair carpet. This sucker grabs hair so good that my cat trees almost look newish!" — spztckttnGet it from Amazon for $25.Advertisement
10amazon.comA garbage disposal brushPromising review: "Do you ever remove the rubber cap between your sink and disposal? It is beyond gross! This is shaped just right and makes quick work of a yucky job. Good to do to keep odors away." — Mom328LSAGet it from Amazon for $10.11www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comA pack of washing machine cleaning tablets that remove built-up detergent scumPromising reviews: "I didn’t think I would ever be so excited about such a thing as washing machine cleaning tablets. I also never realized how dirty my washing machine was. It now sparkles, doesn’t smell musty, and has removed so much gunk from around the drum/gasket. You should get these." — AVDWGet a pack of six from Amazon for $12. 12amazon.com, amazon.comA long-handle wall cleaner with four extension polesPromising review: "Do you envy your friends and the fact that their walls are always spotless? Do your kids use the walls as their personal napkins or jungle gym? Are you tired of spending hours a day cleaning? Fret no more - this really does the trick! Seriously though, I was tired of seeing spots and stains on our walls. I even changed our builder-grade flat paint to a nice eggshell grayish that everyone seems to love. But we still had issues with scuffs and marks. This 'wall mop' has been a life and time saver!!" — Savannah WilsonGet it from Amazon for $40.Advertisement
13www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comA tub of The Pink Stuff, an all-purpose pastePromising review: "My oven door was disgusting! I’ve tried numerous products and nothing worked. I pasted this stuff on, and five minutes of scrubbing with a hard bristle brush, and it’s just like new!!" — Adam F. Get it from Amazon for $6.14amazon.com, amazon.comA cleaning brush kit to draw out the dust hidden in plain sightThis five-piece kit comes with a track cleaning brush, a tile lines brush, a window blind duster, a 2-in-1 windowsill sweeper, and a hand-held groove gap brush. Promising review: "We just moved and the previous owners of our new house left us a wonderful amount of dust and dirt to clean. I was originally looking for just a vent cleaner and stumbled upon these multi-kits. The price point is amazing, and it really does seem like a do-it-all all kit." — Ty Loli Get it from Amazon for $9.15amazon.com, amazon.comA pack of microfiber cloths for a lint- and streak-free finish on glasswarePromising review: "If you have any glass light fixtures in your home you absolutely need this product. I don't think the fixture was this clear even when I bought it, and the best part is it’s just using water and the two rags." — Lisa Collins Get a pack of eight from Amazon for $18.Advertisement
16amazon.com, amazon.comA vacuum hose attachmentPromising review: "This thing is seriously amazing. I figured out how to use it very quickly and it worked like a charm. I had a sock stuck wayy down in my vent and would've had no idea! I still can't believe how much lent and dust came out of my dryer. My husband is already talking about other uses for this unique tool, like getting into tight spaces in our cars." — J. JohnsonGet it from Amazon for $9.17amazon.comA FlexiSnake Drain Weasel not meant for the faint of heartThis FlexiSnake is great for sinks and showers in which the water takes forever to go down, plus it's reusable — just clean with hot water and soap after each use. Promising review: "My shower drain had been clogged and so before I called a plumber, I decided to give this baby a try. All I can say is that I wish I had stock in this company. This is a fantastic item that every single person who owns or rents a home should have. It was EASY to assemble the gadget. It was EASY TO USE. And best of all-it pulled out so much hair that it looked like a giant rat. I could not believe how QUICKLY I was able to do the job, and I can’t tell you the deep satisfaction it gave me to know that all that crap was out of my drain. I’m telling you, it is worth every penny!" — 1CreeksidegalGet a five-pack from Amazon for $20.18amazon.com, amazon.comAffresh cleaning tabletsPromising review: "I had tried lots of white vinegar for two cycles in my 20-year-old dishwasher for the cloudy and powdery dinginess it had started doing, and it only helped about 30%. We have very hard water. This zapped the buildup, and the glass is clear again, and colored plastics no longer have the powdery-like coating. So glad I took a chance on this!" — J. HoldenGet a pack of six from Amazon for $8.Advertisement
19amazon.comA water-based tile penPromising review: "These things are awesome! I cleaned my bathroom tile grout first because the lady who lived there before me really let it go. A few places stayed stained, and I was worried it wouldn't cover them, but all grout areas are bright white and look new after using this." — Donna K Cook Get it from Amazon for $9.20amazon.com, amazon.comA mattress vacuum equipped with a UV light to obliterate scary bacteriaPromising review: "So I brought this originally for my son, who gets really bad allergies to dust. At first, we didn't know what was causing this until someone told me to check our beds and furniture. Even though we change our bedsheets regularly, there will be dust left over. So I decided to give this a try and they were right! I couldn't believe how many mites and how much dust there was. I took my time cleaning everyone's bed and our sofa, which was easy to use and light. My son hasn't had a reaction in a while, which means this product works for my family!" — LisaGet it from Amazon for $40.21amazon.comA wood polish lauded by one reviewer as the best money they've ever spentPromising review: "I've been using this since the 80s. My mom made us spring clean every spring break. We had to go over all the doors, all the woodwork, all the furniture, banisters and cabinets. We also had to clean every wall, every cabinet out, every closet out and every drawer out lol. It was hell, let me tell you, but boy, do I know how to clean now! I now use this in my house and love it. It covers scratches and knicks and makes everything look new and shiny." — LBGet it from Amazon for $11.Advertisement
22amazon.com, amazon.comA Glisten foaming cleaner to neutralize the funky odors coming from your garbage disposalPromising review: "I went on a trip, and when I came back, there was this foul odor coming from my garbage disposal (even though we didn’t leave any dishes on the sink), and I tried every home remedy I could think of to get rid of the smell, but nothing did. So I turned to the internet, and immediately, these seemed like the best choice for an okay price. I followed the instructions carefully, and within a minute, I saw the foam rise up and then go back down — awful smell FINALLY GONE!" — A.L.

You can clean both sides of two blinds at once and grip them firmly to get ALL of the dust off. Plus, it comes with five covers so that no matter how dirty your blinds are, you'll be able to finish dusting your whole house! I also love that you can wash the covers and don't have to waste money on refills." — SarahGet it from Amazon for $7.24amazon.comA stain cleaner that clings to silicone sealantsPromising review: "You guys. I’m embarrassed to even show you this. The grout around our tub was DISGUSTING. It was never caulked right and it got gross very quickly. I would scrub. The cleaning lady would scrub. It would get worse. Well, I came across this in a BuzzFeed list, and this stuff made me curious. I don’t know why it doesn’t have 10,000 good reviews. Seriously. All I did was squeeze it on and walk away. I let it sit overnight. Check this out. Buy it. Like today." — KarynBGet it from Amazon for $15.Advertisement

BOOM! You're done.Promising review: "OK, so I love to clean, and I run bleach through the jets prob twice a month on top of my daily weekly cleaning. And I was skeptical about how this product could get any cleaner than I thought it was. Well, I am here to tell you this pic is after the second cleaning with this cleaner!!!! I am a believer and would highly recommend this product to anyone with a jetted tub!!" — Momof2greatboysGet it from Amazon for $19.26amazon.comCleaning cups that'll deep clean your coffee machine within minutesPromising review: "We’ve had our Keurig for a few years, and with the exception of using only filtered water and dispensing hot water every so often, we’ve never cleaned the needle or K-Cup area. I used three cleaning cups back to back, and WOW, our machine was dirty! I'm so happy I purchased these! I’ll be keeping up on cleaning these more often." — Heather GarciaGet a six-pack from Amazon for $10.27youtube.com, Scrubbing BubblesA Scrubbing Bubbles toilet stamp to release a foaming gel with every flushPromising review: "I was sooo skeptical and was confused about how they’d work but the gel solidifies and with every flush, suds wash through with the water and it really makes a fresh difference. Also the scent is light but really nice and fresh! I recommend these 100%! They’re super interesting but they do the job." — JanetGet a dispenser and six stamps from Amazon for $5.Advertisement
