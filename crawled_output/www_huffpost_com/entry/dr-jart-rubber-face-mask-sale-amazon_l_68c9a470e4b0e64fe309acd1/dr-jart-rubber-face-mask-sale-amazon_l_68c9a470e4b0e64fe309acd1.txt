My skin does feel plump, moist, and healthy after the treatment but there are no long term benefits.” — Ashley “I had a rosacea breakout and wearing this felt so nice. It cooled it down so well I wanted to keep wearing it. Even the redness was mostly gone when I took it off. Was very hydrating too.
