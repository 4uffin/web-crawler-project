And while I (and I’m sure many of you) have spent the better part of my life resisting this universal truth, it is never more apparent, or unavoidable, than when it comes to footwear — especially shoe styles like flats.In fact, it has personally become so unavoidable that being able to walk without agony is a style sacrifice I’m now willing to make. Still, I’m definitely not ready to go full ortho — and thankfully, I don’t have to: There are actually numerous ways to keep my feet happy without totally breaking my sartorial spirit, and many are just a click away on Amazon.Advertisement
You don’t have to take my word for it — customers are also raving about the relief they get from these supportive styles. So read on for some of the site’s most popular options. Your feet will thank you.1VivaiaVivaia Margot square-toe v-cut flatsAvailable in a shocking number of colors and patterns, these truly lightweight flats have a square toe, a V-cut upper silhouette and soft, flexible and subtly ribbed fabric made from recycled plastic bottles. Best of all, the springy insole and sturdy rubber outer sole make them great for long walks or days spent standing.HuffPost shopping writer Lourdes Avila Uribe owns a pair and said, "I wore my them on a nearly two-mile walk to the office this week and found that I had a bounce in my step the entire way, and I didn’t even need to break them in first. The arch support couldn’t be better, and my ankles felt secure and steady the entire journey without chafing or the creation of any blisters."Promising review: "I'm glad I finally tried this brand. I needed black flats that are comfortable with some arch support.These are perfect for my needs. I can wear them all day and walk distances. They have a squared off toe, which makes them more comfortable than the pointed shoes that I have. And they are lightweight and washable! I will buy this brand again." — LAS$97+ at Vivaia$100+ at Amazon2Amazon.comAthlefit closed-toe sandalsThey’re billed a flat sandal, but they do have a closed toe — and when you can actually see the supportive arch and molded, memory foam cork footbed, I’d say they’re worth including on this list. Get them in sizes 5.5-11.Promising Amazon reviews:I love these Athlefit shoes. They are beautiful and comfortable, and they fit perfectly, lightweight with good arch support! Great price!! I have them in all four colors and wish they had them in all the dansko colors, like ivy, chocolate, mustard, etc. Get on it Athlefit! ;-) – Vicki TrotterI was so impressed with the quality and fit that I ordered in another color! It’s rare that I find a comfort shoe with just the right amount of arch support. There is plenty of space for you to wiggle your toes and the leather is soft enough that it doesn’t rub the top of your foot. – AnnaLOVE these sandals. Comfortable right out of the box - wide toe box and adjustable ankle strap. Sandal footbed has great support and sturdy sole - great for walking. – Julie J$40 at Amazon3Amazon.comNaturalizer Vivienne ballet flatAlong with built-in arch support, these flats have Naturalizer’s Contour+ technology, which means they have a cushy sole that’s anatomically sculpted to follow the natural contours of the foot. Get them in sizes 5-13 (but check to make sure your preferred style and color combo is available).Promising Amazon reviews:"I stand on my feet for majority of the day at work. At least 6 hours with some breaks in between. These are super comfortable and probably the best flats I have ever bought since they are supportive and soft at the same time. I have even removed the inserts to put in other pairs of my flats and this helps the comfort of my other shoes. I have these in multiple colors and they wear very well. They still look new after many wears!" – Leanne Butler"I am wary of flats as they can have little support and run either too wode or too narrow, resulting in blisters and sore feet, BUT these flats are truly comfortable after only an hour or two of breaking in around the house! Extra points for looking cute and not “orthopedic”. – Kindle1"These are the second pair of these shoes that I've ordered. They start out a little tight, but the leather stretches and they become more comfortable. They are my first choice for a day of work for the support and comfort they provide while walking around." – Christian L Hilton$37+ at Amazon$70+ at DSWAdvertisement
4Amazon.comClark Jeanette ballet flatWith built-in arch support and a super flexible topline that makes them a breeze to slip on and off, these ballet flats will treat your feet right. They also have a removable footbed in case you need to up the comfort level with your own orthotics. Get them in sizes 5-12 and up to 16 colors, although not all combinations may be available.Promising Amazon reviews:"This shoe is great value ,fits true to size, has amazing arch support and great quality ! It feels like you are walking on air!" – Kimberly B"This shoe is soooo comfortable! I work retail, standing and walking hours at a time...this has been the most supportive and comfortable shoe I've worn. I will be buying more in different colors." – ChaCha$85 at AmazonAdvertisement
5FryeFrye Ivy slip-on shoeIf you're looking for a more casual style that still offers refined construction, know that Frye's Ivy slip-on boasts the brand’s premium leather fabrication paired with a silhouette that feels more down-to-earth. It's also made with a cushioned footbed and a cup sole that's designed to hug your heel. Get it in sizes 5.5-12 and in five colors (although not all color and size combinations are available.)Promising Frye review: “True to size, and is super comfy. The shoe slips on easily and still offers nice support. Dark green color is beautiful! And the suede is soft. These shoes were comfortable to wear right out of the box. I wore them all day with no issues.” — Catherine$138 at Frye6Amazon.comDansko Larisa slip-on flatsDansko clogs are requisite footwear for anyone who spends a lot of time on their feet, so it’s no surprise you’ll get support and comfort from these slides, which have Dansko's unique technology and molded EVA footbed. They're available in medium and wide and in sizes 5.5/6-11.5/12.Promising Amazon reviews:"I have these shoes in several colors and have been wearing them for years. I have higher arches and a wider foot so finding shoes that are comfortable is tough. I can stand and teach all day in these and walk long distances in comfort. Arch and heel support is excellent and no heel blisters even on the first wear. Sole is long lasting and non-slip, I have one pair that is several years old and they still look new. Well worth the price." – Coopergrl"In the past I thought I’d found shoes to make my feet feel good. I was wrong. These shoes I just bought are the absolute best! They are so good looking and I’m getting lots of compliments on the style. The most important aspects for me are the arch support and the metatarsal support. Often I go to bed with aching feet and toes. With these shoes that doesn’t happen at all!!!! I can’t believe I’m getting such style and comfort at the same time. I’m tempted to donate my other shoes and buy only this brand in multiple colors. Where have there been all my adult life?" – Tennessee Grandmother$123+ at Amazon$130+ at Zappos$130 at DanskoAdvertisement
7Amazon.comNaturalizer Flexy flatThese classic flats have similar comfort features to the other Naturalizer pair we featured above, but with a cute heel detail to add interest. Get them in sizes 5-12. (Wide and narrow options are available as well.)Promising Amazon reviews:"Being a women’s size 12 makes it near impossible to find shoes in my size. Most shoe brands don’t even make that size and most shoe stores don’t carry it. I ordered these shoes as a comfortable, somewhat dressy option for work. I had already purchased and returned a few others that did not fit. These fit perfectly and are very comfortable. I recently tore my meniscus and these provided the support I needed and did not irritate the injury more despite being on my feet all day." – Jewels"As a flight attendant, I spend long hours on my feet, so comfortable shoes are a must. These black flats are an absolute game-changer! Not only are they stylish, but they're also incredibly comfortable, soft, and durable. It's like walking on clouds, even during those long shifts in the air. The support and cushioning they provide make all the difference, allowing me to stay on my feet without any discomfort or fatigue." – Anonymous$79 at Amazon$70+ at Naturalizer$70+ at DSW8Amazon.comLifestride Women’s Margot loaferI love a loafer — especially when it comes with a cushy insole, super flexible outsole, and added heel and arch support. The Lifestride Margot loafers check all the boxes.Promising Amazon reviews:"I love these! I have them in black and brown. I wear them to work all the time and they're really comfy. I found the size 7 to be true to size. There was no break in period. I also bought the Sam Edelman loafers, but I personally think these are SO much better. I returned the Sam Edelman ones. These are way more comfortable and supportive while still being cute. I wish there were more colors!" – Jess C"I have elhers danlos and I struggle with finding shoes that are comfortable and supportive and that help with keeping my foot arched. These are perfect! I can wear them all day, sometimes at the end of the day my feet feel better than they did that morning. Perfect for wide feet." – Morgan Groves"These are the BEST work shoes I’ve ever worn. I work in downtown dc where you have to “dress up” but also walk a half mile to the metro. I’ve struggled with work shoes that are attractive and comfortable and I can safely say that these are the first ones that truly fit both bills. I had foot surgery last year so that made supportive comfortable shoes even more important. I wish they came in more colors I will honestly just keep buying these forever." – Happygolucky$31+ at Amazon9Amazon.comSkechers Cleo honeycomb flatSkechers is known for it’s comfortable shoes, and these seamless knit flats, available in sizes 5-11, are no exception. The soft and stretchy knit upper and air cooled memory foam insole are just added bonuses.Promising Amazon reviews:"I needed a pair of slip on quick flats that would go with summer dresses I have. I have expensive sandals and wedges but sometimes I just need to run to the store or mailbox quickly. I have always liked how Skechers fit my feet so I was confident these would fit fine. I was pleased immediately when I tried them on. They are certainly the most comfortable and supportive flats I've ever had." – Charlotte B"Love these shoes. Wanted a comfortable pair of shoes that I could get around in all day with excellent support. This shoe meets all of my needs and manages to look classy at the same time. Love them!" – Chipper$40+ at AmazonAdvertisement
10Amazon.comLifestride Immy slip-onWith a breathable, flexible mesh upper and sporty contoured outsole with a slight wedge, I can tell these shoes are going to take care of my feet just by looking at them. Promising Amazon reviews:"I bought them for a trip that would include a lot of walking (work conference). These shoes are lightweight yet supportive. Wore them all day and walked over 7500 steps and never had a thought about my feet hurting. Highly recommend! And I have wide feet, and issues with a bunion and plantar fasciitis!" – Tanya Johanek"I wear 7 1/2 wide with a moderate bunion on my right foot and these are amazing. My right foot is just over a half size bigger than my left so finding shoes that accommodate that weirdo condition and my bunion is impossible but these magic babies fit!! I'm an Admin Assistant and these are my goes with anything, don't have to worry about my throbbing toe shoes. All the right stretch and support and a perfect bit of height to the heel. Wish they came in more colors!!" – Jessica P Wygal$60 at Amazon11Amazon.comClark’s Sara ballet flatThese flats have a classic ballet profile and built-in heel and arch support, but what really sells it is the sporty-chic bottom that feels very on-trend.Promising Amazon reviews:"They have great arch support and are pretty as well. The price was right also." – Amazon customer"These shoes are great. They fit perfectly and are so comfortable! Many flats are cut low across the toes. These are not. Again a lot of flats I have tried have no support. These provide enough support that I can wear them all day without my feet getting tired." – Wunderlust"They wrap my feet like a loving hug. Soft walk, supportive but not constrictive. I love them!" – TeddyB$58+ at Amazon12Amazon.comMarc Joseph New York comfort slip-onThese handcrafted flats (available in sizes 6-10) have a padded footbed, gel heel insert, substantial arch support, an anti-slip rubber sole, and a simple, versatile upper.
