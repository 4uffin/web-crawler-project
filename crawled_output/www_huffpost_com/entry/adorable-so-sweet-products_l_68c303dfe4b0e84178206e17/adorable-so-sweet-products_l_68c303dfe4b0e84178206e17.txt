The cup is made of silicone, so it is kind of slippery, but safe and will not break if I drop it." ‚Äî Jimmyzzxhlh$20 at Amazon2Sora Seven / EtsyStar-shaped Croc charms that look cute enough to eatSora Seven is a small business that sells fun Croc charms and other accessories. Promising review: "The prettiest little jelly star charm! Every charm I've ordered has been so cute and really great quality. You definitely need these!" ‚Äî Kayla$4+ at Etsy3www.amazon.com, AmazonA decorative tray with sweet gilded bowsReviewers say to pay attention to the measurements, because it's smaller than they assumed! Promising review: "Charming and elegant. This looks so expensive. I gave it to my mother for her birthday, and she was quite impressed. She uses it as a place to put her rings when she is doing things in the kitchen. It‚Äôs the perfect size, and she was very impressed. I didn‚Äôt want to tell her how inexpensive it was, but isn‚Äôt that what you want in a gift? A big bang for your buck?" ‚Äî NMW$9 at AmazonAdvertisement
4Rebecca O'Connell / BuzzFeedA sad duck night-light ready to cheer you upMy husband got me this light as a gift, and I can confirm it's very cute. If you firmly tap or squeeze it, you can toggle between three brightness settings. It's not bright enough to read by, but it works quite nicely as a night-light or for mood lighting. The legs are wiggly, which is definitely a selling point for me. Promising review: "This little lamp is BEYOND adorable. I got it as a gift for my niece, and she loved it. It's super cute, has a soft squishy texture, and has a little X for his butt. Maybe some won't like the little X, but it just adds extra cuteness. Worked right out of the box. Seemed pretty bright. Squish him, and the level changes. I can't speak to life expectancy, but it seems decent enough quality. Freaking adorable! Way better than expected." ‚Äî KF$17 at AmazonAdvertisement
5www.amazon.comA flower-shaped dish brush so cute, you'll actually get excited to cleanCheck out a TikTok of the flower scrubber in action. Promising review: "Love having this on my kitchen sink. It‚Äôs happy and cute and makes me happy. One leaf did twist off after a few weeks of use, but it‚Äôs still cute, and I could‚Äôve been more careful holding it. It's not a super stiff brush, but it works well for most hand washing and quick rinses. Brush rinses well, and food doesn‚Äôt get caught in it. I was happy to find it has a hidden scraper edge on top of the brush. Will def buy again when this one gets gross since it brings so much tiny joy into my kitchen." ‚Äî Hannah Jo Wilson$14 at Amazon6www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comAdorably-shaped bandages shaped like Smurfs, fairies, flowers, and other cute designsPromising review: "I‚Äôm a paramedic and give these to my patients. Wish I had more. Really helps with the kids. Treated a rattlesnake bite on a little one and covered the tubing with fun stickers. It made my kiddo happy, and it means a lot. Need to order more." ‚Äî rebekah e$8 at AmazonAdvertisement
7Urban OutfittersA beret-wearing cat keychain with a heart-shaped mount$6 at Urban Outfitters8Amazon, AmazonCloth, zippered pouches for people looking to cut down on waste while gazing into Stitch's adorable faceYou can throw these in the washing machine or dishwasher!Promising review: "These are amazing to just organize your spoons and accessories when it comes to toddler foods. The zipper opens and closes smoothly. Easy to wash; I just throw them in the washing machine with no issue. Love how they come in different sizes!!! Ended up buying two sets!" ‚Äî ST$25 at Amazon9www.amazon.comA Polly Pocket shaped like Michael Scott's mugHow many show references can you find in this set? I can't believe they included Kevin's spilled chili. üò≠Promising review: "I'm a vintage Polly Pocket collector as well as a huge pop culture fan, and this is SUCH a fun addition to my collection. It's detailed with tons of fun little Easter eggs and pieces. The packaging is great, and clearly designed to display the set without unboxing it. I kept the packaging but display it on a shelf, and it's cute whether open or closed. It's relatively large compared to the original Bluebird compacts, but it makes up for it with how many rooms and scenes it depicts. I also have the Friends compact, and the two coffee mugs look adorable together (despite the handles being on opposite sides). I love Mattel for making this." ‚Äî Laura$35 at AmazonAdvertisement
10Amazon, AmazonA set of mushroom bookmarksPromising review: "These are very cute! I love the flexibility. The stems are long, so it will not get knocked out of your book (my book is always roaming in my bag). The top is subtle. It really looks like a mushroom emerging from your book. Worth the buy." ‚Äî Atticus$9 at Amazon11AmazonLittle heart-shaped grippers to help with glasses that keep falling down your nosePromising review: "I bought these for my Ray-Ban sunglasses, and they work perfectly! ‚ù§Ô∏è" ‚Äî BMosqueda$7 at Amazon12Ten By Ten / EtsyA suncatcher decal featuring a happy capybara taking a nice bathTen By Ten is a small business that sells stickers and other accessories. $8 at EtsyAdvertisement
13www.amazon.comA set of toilet bolt caps when you're super serious about having a home that's full of whimsyPromising review: "Absolutely love these. My daughter‚Äôs toilet was missing the original caps, so I thought I would give these a try. They are so nice looking!! She loves them. Great quality and fits perfectly over the screw. Going to buy some for my bathroom now! Buy it, you won‚Äôt regret it." ‚Äî Valentine Girl$16 at Amazon14Merci MiloAn OMG-worthy Japanese blind box featuring one of four miniature animal vehicle toysMerci Milo is a family-owned small business formed in Los Angeles that sells fun children's products.$11 at Merci Milo15www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comImpossibly darling flower vase fridge magnets that come with tiny faux flowersPromising review: "So cute on the fridge and worth the money. This would be a great gift for friends and family. These are small and good quality. Definitely will buy again." ‚Äî Faith$12 at AmazonAdvertisement
16Tocobo, www.amazon.comAn intensive Tocobo glazed lip balm for people who take cute packaging VERY seriouslyBuzzFeed writer Amber Usher says, "I‚Äôve tried plenty of lip products, and this is by far the best. If I had to describe the texture, I would say it‚Äôs like a silky Vaseline. It's thick, but it applies smoothly. You only need a tiny bit to cover your lips, and it leaves them soooo moisturized. It doesn‚Äôt feel like the product is just sitting on top of your lips; rather, your lips are actually being nourished. I also feel like it stays on pretty well. The first time I tried it, I noticed I still had product on my lips after eating and drinking, which I‚Äôve never experienced with other lip masks before. And bonus points for the cute jar and spatula. Speaking of spatulas, here's a hack so you don‚Äôt lose yours: Apply (or super glue) these self-adhesive cable clips on the top of the jar, and you‚Äôll never lose a spatula again."Promising review: "I love the little jar it comes in; it‚Äôs so super cute. I take it with me everywhere as one of my essentials and dab some on when I need it. It‚Äôs hydrating, super smooth, and delicious! My lips look and feel smooth and soft, and I‚Äôm making this product my go-to!" ‚Äî It was to small...$12 at Amazon17www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comA "Gracula" garlic crusherPromising review: "I love this little guy. I found him on a BuzzFeed list and had to have it as soon as I saw it! I‚Äôve minced as many as five cloves in it in seconds. It‚Äôs a little tricky getting all of the garlic out once minced (I use a silicone basting brush to get most of it, but I always use more than the recipe calls for anyway, so it‚Äôs not a deal breaker). Cleanup is a breeze because he goes right in the dishwasher!" ‚Äî Barbie$20 at Amazon18Amazon, www.amazon.comA paw-shaped chair cushionPromising review: "I freaking LOVE this paw cushion! This paw cushion absolutely saves my butt. It's not super thick or as filled as you might hope. But I read reviews and was prepared for that. A little extra padding would be great, but even without it, this cushion is soft and comfy! It's still worth every dime. It's perfect if you have one of those hanging indoor/outdoor rope chairs, too! This cushion is soft, cute, and comfortable. Buy yourself this thing. You deserve it." ‚Äî mandarabbit$24 at AmazonAdvertisement
19www.amazon.comA mini Bob Ross paint-by-numbers kitThe kit comes with two landscapes and one portrait of Bob.Promising review: "I have to admit I was skeptical because of the price and size. However, I got these for my husband for his birthday (he loves Bob Ross) and What a find!! We had so much fun mixing colors and painting. Would definitely recommend. The fact that they are small makes them even more special. I wish there were more to paint!" ‚Äî slb m$7 at Amazon20AmazonA cutie pie planner to help you be a busy beePeter Pauper Press is a family-owned small business founded in 1928.Promising review: "I am absolutely in love. I have always struggled with being overwhelmed with to-do lists (both having them in my mind and making them). This cute, fun design makes that task less daunting and easier, thanks to how it‚Äôs organized. It lets me divide tasks up into immediate needs and tasks to do eventually, as well as gives me a space for appointments and reminders for calling people. I also thoroughly enjoy the mood marker and the 'how was your day' section, as it also helps me track my mood. I absolutely adore this, and it will be a positive permanent addition to my life." ‚Äî River$6 at Amazon21www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comA set of cowboy straw toppersPromising review: "So SO CUUUTE! 10/10!! Good product and keeps my straw from getting bugs or germs on it! Plus, it‚Äôs really cute." ‚Äî JennA$6 at AmazonAdvertisement
22AmazonA charming waterproof shelf linerPromising review: "Very good quality liner. I love the daisy print and it is a good thickness. Super easy to cut (I used a box cutter). Definitely recommend!" ‚Äî Karen$7 at Amazon23AmazonA Godzilla microwave cleaner that shoots out cleansing steam instead of lasersPromising review: "Followed instructions for use and had great results cleaning a nightmare of a mess from baked-on chili in the microwave." ‚Äî Rj$13 at Amazon24Amazon, AmazonTeeny-tiny onigiri vasesPromising review: "These are literally so, so, so tiny but my daughter loves them! She‚Äôs hoping to put an individual four-leaf clover in each (they really are teeny), and it‚Äôs going to be adorable." ‚Äî Jodi$20 at AmazonAdvertisement
25AmazonTiconderoga erasers shaped like classic yellow pencilsTiconderoga makes the best #2 pencils, IMO, so it makes sense their erasers are good too. Promising review: "This is the second school year I am buying these for my daughter because she loves them that much and they last the whole year. They are Ticonderoga, so of course they work the best of all the brands. (Their pencils are a teacher‚Äôs first choice. üòâ) They are so cute and cheap for as long as they last. Also, they don‚Äôt leave a lot of residue, and when it comes to erasing, that‚Äôs huge!" ‚Äî S. Wallace$5 at Amazon26www.amazon.comA fanciful mushroom kitchen timerThis winds up and times up to 60 minutes, ending in a loud buzzer. Reviewers also use it to help time themselves with work tasks and studying. Promising review: "This is whimsical and fun; my kids love it. I tell them their dinner comes from a fairy mushroom forest. üòã Works great, keeps my little monsters in line ‚Äî 'Dad, the mushroom went off.' Love it." ‚Äî Vik V$8 at Amazon27Amazon, www.amazon.comA set of vintage-inspired spoonsPromising review: "The perfect little coffee spoons on my coffee bar! They go with my modern vintage thrifted decor and make me smile. ü•∞" ‚Äî Lindsey$5 at AmazonAdvertisement
28www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comItty-bitty, collapsible storage crates in soothing pastel colorsPromising review: "These are so cute and very easy to set up. I have my hairclips and scrunchies in them. I love that they are stackable, so they don't take up too much space. They're about the same size as my hand, so they're relatively small. They're good for storing little things like mini hand lotions and hand sanitizer. If you're thinking about getting them, I highly recommend them!" ‚Äî Dog_Mom$10 at Amazon29www.amazon.comA pocket library complete with mini booksPromising review: "Love this product. It‚Äôs so cute and really helpful for people who may struggle with anxiety or other mental health concerns. It‚Äôs very well-made, and the details on the books are amazing!" ‚Äî Cora$12 at Amazon30www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comA solar-powered frog figurine with a lantern that lights up when the sun setsPromising review: "I love this!

It‚Äôs so cute, too!" ‚Äî Isabel$10 at Amazon32www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comClarence the Clarifier Fish, who will swim amongst your aquatic friendsPromising review: "This little guy is a lifesaver. Being a very busy woman with less and less time between life and career, Clarence has made life so much simpler. I no longer need to clean my tank as often and can enjoy the little time I have to do the things I need to do (which is relax üòå). This is the second one I have gotten and felt the need to share my experience with it. Follow the instructions on the back, and you too could spend less time cleaning your tank and more time enjoying your tank. Plus, he's super cute. 10/10 recommend!!" ‚Äî TZ$13 at Amazon33Anthropologie, AnthropologieA canvas tote similar to the ever-popular Trader Joe's onesPromising review: "Looks just like my [dog], so I just had to get it!!!
