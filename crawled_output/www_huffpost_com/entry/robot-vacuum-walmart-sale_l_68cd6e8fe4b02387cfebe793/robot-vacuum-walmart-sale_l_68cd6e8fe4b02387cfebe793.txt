Robot vacuums are a game-changer for timely cleaning, sparing you from manually pushing and pulling a heavy appliance or broom around your living space and, in some cases, doubling as a mop. We found a compact 2-in-1 robot vacuum, which one reviewer calls a “perfect little helper,” is currently on sale for under $100! The best deal is on the white option when you hit the on-page $20 off coupon — knocking its price to just under $80! That’s 20% off its regular floating price.This little robot vacuums and mops for up to a claimed 120 minutes and docks automatically to charge back up. By using voice commands with Alexa or Google Assistant or its dedicated smartphone app, you can also set it on a cleaning schedule. That means you can automate those floors clean without remembering to start your robot up!Advertisement

It has a spin brush (and includes two extras) to scrub the floors of debris, too. Swapping it from vacuum to mopping is a cinch; just switch the dustbin with a mop tank, add water, and you’re good to go.This versatile machine is excellent for hardwood and tile flooring as much as rugs and carpets. Best of all, it has sensors that prevent it from colliding into walls or falling from a step or staircase.Advertisement

Read on for more promising reviews of the Onoson 2-in-1 vacuum cleaner and mop robot, and nab it on sale today.“I’ve had this vacuum for about 2 weeks already, I absolutely love! We have a very large room with a small hallway and it’ll go through the whole thing. even tho the room “looks” clean that little robot will find some debris. Great suction power and its not very noisy at all, the app is wonderful and very easy to use plus it has like 2-3 more features that the remote control doesn’t have. might have to get another one” — esmerelda “After a few days, I still like it very much. The noise is low and it saves my time. That’s what I’m looking forward to. No shortcomings have been found yet.” —Walmart Customer “This robot does a good job sweeping and light mopping of the floors. We have hardwood and tile (ceramic and vinyl) that the robots are used for. While they clean the areas well, do not expect them to handle any heavy dirt or stains. They do well at surface dirt with the mopping but that is about it. They also have a shorter run time than our other vacuum robots. Overall they are helpful in keeping our floors clean.” — Danny “The sale price is unbeatable. This vacuum has gotten up SO much dog fur and general yuck around our floors. We are a clean family, or so I thought. I run this daily and every day the canister is FULL. I love bare feet and this vacuum allows me to walk around my house without small junk getting stuck to my soles.” — Becky “sweeps better than a broom. If you leave it running when the battery gets low, it automatically goes to the charging station. If you have pets in the house, it is a good ideal to stop it every once in a while and dump the tray for better results.” — warren $79.99+ at Walmart with coupon (regularly $99.99)The Real Deal: We use deal trackers and commerce experience to sift through “fake” hike-and-drop deals and other deceptive sales tactics.
