Namely, with something like this highly rated, reviewer and editor-loved bodywash from Naturium. Packaged in an easy-dispense pump bottle with a super chic logo, the wash looks like something from a small boutique that costs an arm and a leg. And while it’s a little more than maybe your typical drugstore wash, at $16.99, fans say it’s a “good deal for the ingredients,” the “best body wash ever” and “did more for my mature skin than a popular product I was using made specifically for crepey skin.” “My skin is immediately more smooth-looking from having used this,” one said. “It’s very gentle on my skin, and the scent isn’t particularly strong, so I can also comfortably use it on my face as well.” Advertisement
$16.99 at AmazonComing in various styles, reviewers (and the internet) seem to love the Glow Getter multi-oil wash, the Smoother exfoliator and the Perfector with salicylic acid for hydrating and smoothing crepey skin. AmazonWith options for brightening, smoothing, hydrating and more — there's no wrong choice. Advertisement
Celebrated for its milky lather, the Glow Getter is an oil-based wash that leaves skin hydrated, soft and smooth. Made with 50% glycerin, linoleic-rich oils, and plant-derived squalane, it cleans and shines the skin without stripping it of moisture or leaving residue. “Loved the glow it gives your skin without leaving a greasy film,” one wrote. For smoothing crepey skin in particular, one reviewer said the Glow Getter was “Much more economical than medical grade skin care and just as good!” Fans also love alicylic acid-based Perfector, which one user said gave an “immediate visible improvement” to their skin.Another favorite is the Smoother, a glycolic acid body wash for exfoliation and helping level out roughness or bumps. With lactic, pyruvic and tartaric acids and red algae, the brand says the wash helps shed dead skin cells, exposing supple, soft skin. “Bought this out of curiosity. I have been pleasantly surprised by the immediate difference in the appearance of my skin (I’m a senior citizen),” one said. “My skin is considerably smoother and much less crepey.”For something cooling and boosting, senior culture editor Erin Evans has previously recommended the Energizer, “especially after a sweaty gym sesh because it really just eliminates the funk but also is so gentle.” Advertisement

Check out these 5-star reviews of the Naturium body washes and grab one for yourself to bring a little luxury into your shower. “I just got my hands on the Glow Getter multi-oil body wash and I’m absolutely thrilled with the results. I was a bit skeptical at first about the oil-to-gel formula but boy was I pleasantly surprised. As soon as I applied it to my skin I could feel the nourishing properties working their magic. My skin feels incredibly soft and supple and the glow is real. I mean I’m not one for exaggeration but this product truly delivers. The fermented squalene and other gentle ingredients seem to be working in perfect harmony to leave my skin looking radiant and feeling amazing. I’m really looking forward to continuing to use this product and seeing the long-term benefits. If you’re looking for a game-changer in your skincare routine I’d definitely recommend giving the Glow Getter a try. It’s definitely gotten me excited about my daily skincare routine again. The packaging was neatly wrapped ✨️” — Niesha“I use this body wash for a few years now. Nothing better. And I used them all foreign and domestic. It’s great for removing dead skin cells and minimizing crepey skin and the price is great” — Larissa Rosen“This is a great product. I never put a lot of emphasis on a body wash, but this has made my skin so much softer. I’m getting that crepey skin and it has helped tremendously. It feels moisturizing, not like soap that makes your skin dry and tight.” — Lisa Christopher$16.99 at AmazonAdvertisement

4AmazonVanicream cleansing barBoth experts enthusiastically recommended this Vanicream bar soap. Mraz stated that it "is great for dry skin and skin prone to eczema, dermatitis and psoriasis.

Both she and Camp made a point to mention that it's free of drying and irritating ingredients like dyes, fragrances and other common irritants while also being noncomedogenic.$3.99 at Walgreens5AmazonDr. Bronner's Pure-Castile bar soapAccording to Mraz, "Castile soap is a great choice for dry skin — it is vegetable-based and free of chemicals, synthetic ingredients and is hypoallergenic." Because Dr. Bronner's uses hemp seed oil in its formula, it creates a soft, smooth later that won't dry out skin. I love the peppermint scent, but the brand has quite a few options, all of which smell delightfully fresh.Single soap: $4.24+ at AmazonEight-pack: $52.09 at AmazonUnscented: $4.99 at Target6Community GoodsCommunity Goods shampoo barAnd just in case you were looking to expand your package-free bar soap repertoire to hair care as well, Mraz recommends the shampoo and conditioner bars from Community goods.
