Weather-resistant and built with night-vision, the Arlo camera gives you a clear, wide 180-degree view and 2K video coverage, 24/7. The camera works with the Arlo app to give real-time notifications of packages or visitors. It’s got a live video camera, two-way audio, plus the ability to set off a security siren if you see anything fishy going on.“Setup was simple with both wired and wire-free options,” another reviewer wrote. “Real-time notifications are fast and reliable, and the app is user-friendly.” One reviewer, who previously had a Wyze camera, wrote the Arlo is “so much better,” with “clear live feeds, accurate motion detection and clear audio.”“I was able to charge and mount it with ease and don’t have to try and jam my doorbell wires into the bracket,” they wrote. “Can rest assured I have eyes and ears on my front door now.” Advertisement
In addition to your phone alerts, you can hear the doorbell through your house with the Chime 2 plug-in speakers.“We love the chime inside the house so we can actually hear when someone rings the doorbell [when] our phones aren’t around,” one wrote. Another called it “a great option for apartment living where you don’t have a wired in doorbell.”You can opt for the paid Arlo Secure plan, which lets you share and store footage, set personalized alerts for specific people and cars, as well as notifications for animals and fire. All customers can enjoy round-the-clock chat support from the Arlo app, if you have questions or issues with installation or use. Advertisement
Doorbell: $59.99 at Amazon (regularly $94.99)Doorbell & Chime 2: $79.99 at Amazon (regularly $117.41)Knock, knock. Who’s there? More 5-star reviews of the Arlo video doorbell camera. “I recently made the switch from Ring to Arlo and we absolutely love it! The camera quality and the activity detection that the Arlo Doorbell has is AMAZING. It is so clear and the app is so easy to use! Personally, I feel that the security level it offers is a bit higher and better with Arlo.” — Tabatha Mireles“The Arlo Video Doorbell 2K (2nd Gen) exceeded all my expectations. The video quality is crystal clear, even at night, and I love the 180° head-to-toe view — I can see everything from packages on the ground to who’s at my door. The 2-way audio is super convenient, and I really appreciate the instant notifications when someone approaches. Setup was quick, and the option for wire-free or wired installation is a huge plus. The built-in siren adds an extra layer of security I didn’t know I needed. Highly recommend this to anyone wanting peace of mind and a sleek, reliable smart doorbell!” — Deborah Decker“I’m really impressed with the Arlo Video Doorbell! The video quality is excellent, even at night. It has a wide-angle view, so I can clearly see anyone at my door, and the notifications are super fast. Installation was easier than I expected, and the Arlo app is very user-friendly. One of my favorite features is being able to talk to people through the doorbell — even when I’m not home. It gives me so much peace of mind. Highly recommended if you’re looking for smart, reliable home security!” — daiane xavier“We had a Vivint doorbell camera for about 10 years and it stopped working (made a horrible buzzing sound). We were never really happy with the video quality, so we switched to Arlo. Super easy to install and the video quality is much better!” — Wendy S Huesties Doorbell: $59.99 at Amazon (regularly $94.99)Doorbell & Chime 2: $79.99 at Amazon (regularly $117.41)The Real Deal: We use deal trackers and commerce experience to sift through “fake” hike-and-drop deals and other deceptive sales tactics.
