HuffPost learned from Jennifer Bonheur, a New York-based gastroenterologist, that some studies actually show potty stools help facilitate proper squatting and make pooping easier. Resting our feet on a stool while pooping allows our lower muscles to relax, resulting in a more natural positioning.Of course, the granddaddy of all potty stools is also the one with the most fun name to say: the Squatty Potty. It’s synonymous with toilet footstools, but it also comes at a slightly premium cost. Well, we found an alternative that’s basically half the price, and it’s on sale for as much as 50% off, depending on color.

You just need to plug it in the charge it and it seems to hold a long charge. No remote but not needed. It reminds me of a large maybe beige colored (it’s a nice soft color and not bring white) candle which will also be great to have around if the power ever goes out in a storm.
