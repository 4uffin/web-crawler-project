Government studies show this, by the way. These little devices work like recumbent bikes, letting you pedal while sitting on a couch or at a desk, combating an otherwise sedentary lifestyle. If that sounds good to you, we found a digital, remote-powered option that can assist in pedaling, track your progress, is ultra-quiet, is light enough to move from room to room and is so effective, one reviewer says that “after two days of 30 minutes each day, I can already tell a difference in my legs!”Great for mindlessly working out while watching television or even reducing leg strain for remote workers, this easygoing machine is 25% off right now on Amazon— the lowest price we’ve ever seen it. Not bad for a machine some say is “great for building up leg strength.”Advertisement
$59.99 at Amazon (regularly $79.99)It has five manual speeds, plus e-assisted options.While other mini steppers (like this bestselling one HuffPost users love) provide manual pedaling only, this digital option goes the extra mile. It’s got an LCD screen to show calories burned, speed, distance traveled and more, plus a remote to operate its automatic functions. You can also pedal forward or backward with five manual and three automatic-assisted pedaling speeds, letting you choose the resistance to be as leisurely or strenuous as you want. Even better, this under-desk elliptical ships ready-to-use, straight out of the box. Just set it on the ground and pedal away with no need to install or tinker with any pieces.It’s also super quiet.It’s quiet and doesn’t take up much space in the household, so it won’t disturb others while you sneak a workout in. “For the price point, this machine gives great exercise,” says a reviewer. “I have mobility issues, and I started with the first [power] level. […] Week two, I switched to level 2, and wow, it really worked the leg muscles. I could feel it from my ankles to my hips.Advertisement
$59.99 at Amazon (regularly $79.99)Relieve some of that sedentary fatigue with this easygoing device for just under $60, and check out additional promising reviews if you need more of a reason to pedal at home.“I recently purchased the ESL Under Desk Elliptical in the Blue model from Amazon. Despite receiving the sterling silver version, which I believe was priced slightly less, I found the machine to be quite impressive. It’s quiet, as recommended, and surprisingly hefty, indicating durability. The remote control and LCD display make it easy to use. Overall, it’s a decent machine, and I’m looking forward to incorporating it into my weight loss journey.” — Jus Drag’N (Random Thoughts) formally Electronics Junkie “I got my elliptical leg exerciser and after two days of 30 minutes each day, I can already tell a difference in my legs! The machine is quiet and seems to be well built.” — Phyllis Clark “My wife had knee problems but wanted to continue to move her legs with no or little stress. This machine has helped her accomplish her goal of exercise with no strain. It travels with us on trips very well.” — NORTH B. “I didn’t seem to have any strength in my legs―especially my right one. I’ve developed arthritis in my legs. Sometimes I had to physically pickup my right leg to get in the car. I was also limping. I believe a lot of it has to do with inactivity. I use this machine once a day for at least 30 minutes. What a game changer. I no longer limp and no problem getting into or out of my car. Both legs are a lot stronger. This has been my experience. It was a good purchase for me.” — lilly1241 “I bought this for my wife who works from home. She was having issues with her legs getting cramps and feeling fatigued from sitting for 8-10 hours a day. Now she doesn’t have the fatigue and her leg cramps have all but disappeared. It’s well built, totally quiet, runs forward or reverse, has a calorie counter and she absolutely loves it.” — The Grauke$59.99 at Amazon (regularly $79.99)The Real Deal: We use deal trackers and commerce experience to sift through “fake” hike-and-drop deals and other deceptive sales tactics.
