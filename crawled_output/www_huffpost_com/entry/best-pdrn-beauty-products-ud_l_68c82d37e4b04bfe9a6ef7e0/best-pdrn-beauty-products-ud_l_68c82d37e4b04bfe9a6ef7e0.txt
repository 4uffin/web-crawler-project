I’ve always insisted that if you want effective skin care with innovative ingredients at reasonable prices, then the world of Korean-founded beauty is where you should explore. I felt validated in my belief when, last year, I reported on a unique serum that was rapidly growing in virality due to the inclusion of one anti-aging ingredient: polydeoxyribonucleotide, or PDRN for short.PDRN, we learned from board-certified dermatopathologist and skin care brand founder, Dr. Gretchen Frieling, is a portion of DNA that’s typically derived from salmon sperm (you may have heard a similarly-named facial invoked by members of the Kardashian family and their ilk) and is widely used in regenerative and functional medicine, especially in Korea. (She said that vegan alternatives – derived from plants like wild ginseng — have similar benefits despite not being molecularly identical, and all PDRN currently approved for clinical or in-office use is the kind that’s extracted from salmon sperm or a similar fish like trout.)Advertisement
“PDRN has been shown to accelerate repair of damaged skin and promote new tissue growth,” Frieling said. “It also boosts hydration in the skin, promotes cellular turnover and reduces hyperpigmentation.”In terms of anti-aging benefits, Frieling and board-certified dermatologist and founder of Radiant Dermatology Associates, Dr. Dara Spearman, said that PDRN stimulates collagen and elastin production to reduce fine lines and wrinkles, and address volume loss. “In short, it provides benefits that are often only achieved with multiple other ingredients,” Spearman said.

Frieling supplied additional context: “The fact that [PDRN] is available as an injectable and [a] topical increases its versatility and bridges the gap between medical-grade treatments and cosmetic skincare,” she said.This could be the reason we are seeing the recent boom in PDRN-containing products available over the counter — products exactly like the earlier-mentioned Iope PDRN Caffeine Shot serum, which immediately became a favorite among HuffPost readers. Since then, the PDRN product market has expanded to include formulations like the ones featured in the collection below, many of which have been recommended to us by Spearman, Frieling and others.The experts consulted for this story do not necessarily endorse the products ahead unless otherwise noted.Advertisement
1AmazonThe internet-famous PDRN caffeine serum that started it allBoard-certified dermatologist and Beverly Hills plastic surgeon Dr. Daniel Gould suggested the Iope PDRN Caffeine serum, a product with which we’re well acquainted and the recipient of an official HuffPick shopping award. In addition to PDRN — which in this specific formulation is derived from green tea and plants, according to Gould — this well-loved and extremely popular serum contains a more recognizable combination of ingredients. These include niacinamide — a versatile antioxidant that many swear by for everything from brightening skin to managing redness — and probiotics, an unlikely ingredient that dermatologists have previously told HuffPost can do wonders for keeping skin healthy and strong. It also features caffeine, which has antioxidant properties and may aid in reducing the appearance of wrinkles caused by sun damage.$50 at Amazon2AmazonA PDRN serum packed with five different plumping peptidesSpearman suggested this recognizable pink serum by Medicube, a Korean beauty brand that's quickly become synonymous with tons of PDRN-based products, from jelly masks to toners and face creams. The PDRN peptide serum is one of Medicube's best sellers on Amazon, and in addition to salmon sperm-derived PDRN, it's enriched with a complex containing five different types of peptides, which, according to dermatologists that we previously spoke to, are amino acid proteins known to boost collagen production, improve skin texture and promote wound healing. You can also expect to find soothing basil leaf extracts to calm irritated skin, powerful hydrators to draw in moisture, and niacinamide, a well-studied antioxidant that can fade dark spots and brighten skin."[It's] well-liked for the hydration capabilities and easy to layer with [the] matching mask," Spearman said.$19 at Amazon3AmazonA highly concentrated PDRN essence to increase elasticityGould, Spearman and Frieling all mentioned the VT Cosmetics PDRN 100 Essence, a vegan product that contains at least a 10% concentration of PDRN sourced from wild-grown Korean ginseng. According to the brand, ginseng-derived PDRN has a low molecular weight, meaning it's extra stable and offers maximum absorption into the skin. Safe for day and night use, the VT essence also contains panthenol to calm red and troubled skin and ceramides, which are essential for a strong and healthy skin barrier. $31 at AmazonAdvertisement
4AmazonA salmon-derived PDRN ampoule with claims of an optimized delivery systemThe Rejuran Turnover ampoule, a recommendation from Frieling, claims to be the original salmon PDRN product and a brand that is most recognized in this category, according to Gould. This DNA-based formula is enriched with highly purified salmon serum and salmon sperm extracts, ingredient types that are the ideal molecular size for the best and deepest absorption possible, based on brand claims. The ampoule also contains supportive peptides for additional plumping power and raspberry leaf extract, an antioxidant-rich ingredient that soothes and protects against premature skin aging. $52 at AmazonAdvertisement
5AmazonA skin-brightening PDRN serum enriched with vitaminsFrieling also suggested the Genabelle PDRN Vita Toning ampoule, a lightweight daily serum that features encapsulated vitamins, which keeps them fresher and more potent until the moment of application. The combination of vitamins B, C and E promises antioxidant protection and skin-brighening power that helps to fade dark spots and irregular skin texture. The salmon PDRN base also contains a plumping peptide complex and hyaluronic acid, a well-studied humectant that's known for drawing moisture into the skin for a dewy and hydrated complexion.$29 at Amazon6AmazonSheet masks infused with rose-derived PDRNGould mentioned these Mediheal sheet masks that are powered by rose-derived PDRN to improve skin radiance and tell-tale signs of skin aging, as well as squalane, one of my personal favorite ingredients for deeply hydrating skin. It's often believed that the K-beauty industry popularized the use of sheet masks, which are great for packing a concentrated dose of active ingredients into the skin and offer enhanced penetration. 4 pack: $10 at AmazonAdvertisement
7AmazonA unique PDRN collagen capsule creamOur pick: This unique and lightweight moisturizer by Medicube features cream capsules of salmon DNA-derived PDRN suspended in a rich jelly that promises to be residue-free and suitable for all skin types. This type of capsule formulation helps preserve the moisturizer's prized active ingredient and allows you to customize how rich you want the application to be, depending on the number of capsules you use in relation to the gel base. It's also accompanied by collagen to plump the skin and hyaluronic acid to boost moisture, leaving behind a complexion that's bright, glowing and "glass-like."$20 at Amazon8AmazonA "microneedling" serum containing PDRNOur pick: Microneedling is an expensive and slightly uncomfortable in-office procedure that can do wonders for hyperpigmentation, acne scarring, fine lines, and more. While not always a feasible option for most, the VT Cosmetics PDRN Reedle shot is a much more affordable alternative with the added benefit of Korean wild ginseng PDRN. According to the brand, this innovative formula uses a "micro-needling mechanism that promotes instant skin enhancement for a smoother, softer feel." This component also maximizes product absorption for better results and will impart a slight tingling feeling on the skin.$43 at Amazon9AmazonA multi-balm stick containing collagen and PDRNThis all-in-one multi balm by Korean-founded brand Kahi can be used all over the face, on the neck, under the eyes and even on the lips. The plumping and dewy formula has a natural fermented jeju oil base that's meant to deeply nourish skin and uniquely contains salmon-derived collagen to target things like volume loss. $22.99 at AmazonAdvertisement
