If your outlets, floors and nightstands are flooded with power strips and loose cables, this might be the perfect way to tidy it all up.This seven-in-one charging tower offers fast charging with three AC outlets, two USB-A and two USB-C ports all in one small dock. It has a small footprint — one reviewer loves that its vertical design “takes almost no space” — and a flat power cord that sits flush in an electrical outlet. Great for desktops, side tables and nightstands, this awesome charging station isn’t just useful — it’s also a whopping 60% off right now. That’s the lowest price it’s ever been!Advertisement
$39.99 at amazon (regularly $99.99)This tower has a port for practically everything.With seven outlets, this tower can charge basically anything you’ve got at home: tablets, MacBooks, laptops, smartphones and more. With three AC outlets, you can plug in additional electronics and more, and with two USB-A and two USB-C ports, you can charge up devices both old and new. It also has a power readout to display how much wattage is going to each device.And it’s so compact.Its power cable is 5 feet long while the tower itself stands under 6 inches and is just over 4 inches wide and deep. The vertical design takes up minimal space on a desktop or counter, helping keep your cords tidy without having to worry about much tangling.Advertisement
“I put this vertical power station where I had a fairly large flat one that took too much space and with no place to put the devices,” explains one reviewer. “This really did give me more room, and still has room for more. I use it to not only charge devices but also power my PC speakers and desk lamp.”$39.99 at amazon (regularly $99.99)Grab this charging tower now at a whopping 60% off and keep on reading to see what other reviewers have to say about it. But hurry, because we’re not sure this deal will last!“Great value as an alternative to a power strip with the 65W USB output and display. I bought a second one while they were on sale for that USB power monitoring for things like my Roku, phones, and tablets.” — Wake “Really love the design of this. I would say maybe a 4.7/5 only that I wish the charger auto turned on/off depending on if it can even charge or if there’s nothing plugged in. Other than that power draw is consistent and can power multiple devices at once. Build quality is solid, has 4 ports and can charge my phone, laptop, and others at the same time. Charges phone and laptop very quickly.” — michael stevens “I got this charging station to replace a different charging station when the USB adapters failed. The Baseus 7-in-1 is great replacement. I really like how it stays in place on the desk and I like the display showing how many watts is using. It is a great replacement as my previous charging station did not have USB C ports that support higher voltages and currents. I’m able to use it to charge my laptop, phone, and other USB C devices.” — Richard Teel$39.99 at amazon (regularly $99.99)Advertisement

I used these smart plugs for my bedroom and living room lamps! They connected seamlessly and easily to my home WiFi and Alexa! I will confess that I did not use the timer function since I had routines in Alexa to turn the lights on/off! If you are looking to automate your lighting, small appliances then I HIGHLY recommend this product!!" — Wendel Staton"You will NOT regret this purchase. ... Best invention ever. I didn’t know about these until my alarm company suggested they were most cost efficient. So glad they did! Took 2 minutes to set up and I hooked it up to my google. I got these for nights I work late. I can play around with lights and tv in order to appear home. I can’t wait to get more!" — D99520$14.96 at Amazon2AmazonApple AirTag tracking deviceIn addition to being water- and dust-resistant, AirTags have a wildly simple setup, and you can assign each one a name to keep your most valuable belongings sorted.

Promising Amazon review: "I was really holding back on purchasing these earphones because of the price but I looked again at the right time because the sale was amazing and I do not regret it. The noise cancelling is scary good, I don’t know how I have lived without these during school.

4AmazonA smart reusable notebookThe 36-page Rocketbook smart reusable notebook boasts technology that allows you to scan, send and save your drawings, notes or grocery lists straight to your phone using the free Rocketbook app. It comes with a special pen that mimics a true pen-to-paper feel, and with a microfiber cleaning cloth to erase the notebook's content when you're done.Promising Amazon review: "This product is AMAZING. It functions like any normal notebook. It writes nice, not quite like normal notebook paper but pretty close. I love the grid and it's very easy to take notes, make lists, etc. There are plenty of pages so it takes awhile before I even need to reuse the page. The app is easy to set up and use. It handled multiple logins for both personal and work accounts easily, which is something I've struggled with a bit in other services and it sends scans seamlessly wherever I need them. Lots of options for destinations as well, and I love that it auto-captures to do items and adds them to a list for me. It wipes of clean very easily and you can't even tell the page had been used. I've had it for about two weeks now and am already regretting not buying it months ago. I constantly have multiple to do lists that I'm always having to rewrite, so this has saved so much paper already. I also always need paper on-hand for notes for my job, so this makes it easy to keep it all in one place and log what I need while erasing the rest. I'm super impressed with it, it has exceeded my expectations." — Annalise$34 at Amazon5AmazonA pop-up Bluetooth desk systemI'm a proud and regret-free owner of this Logitech desk system that wirelessly connects to my existing work laptop and allows for a more ergonomic desk setup, no matter where I am. A sleek keyboard and touch pad both come in a notebook-style case, which pops open to become a stand for my laptop. The setup and Bluetooth connection were seamless. I love setting up the stand component on a lap desk in bed and using the keyboard and mouse separately so I don't have to crane my neck in an unnatural position when working.$179.99 at AmazonThe Real Deal: We use deal trackers and commerce experience to sift through “fake” hike-and-drop deals and other deceptive sales tactics.
