I've written before about how it's made sweeping easier on my back, and I highly recommend it for anyone who hates sweeping. It practically sweeps on its own, requiring minimal effort on my end to pick up gross stuff. I have this pink one, which is so cute that I don't mind leaving it out. The dustpan is super easy to empty.$26.99+ at Amazon2AmazonEmbrace the '90s-mom dish brushI know the trendy kitchens of TikTok are all about those aesthetically pleasing bamboo dish brushes, but my goodness, just get into these Scotch-Brite brushes. I distinctly remember my family having one of these when I was growing up, and I started using them a few years ago in my own adult home. If you hate doing dishes, one of these will make it so much easier. Since the soap is already in the handle, you don't have to put your hand on the gross sponge. And the handle gives you extra leverage.$15.90 at Amazon3AmazonKeep some 'needs to go up' and 'needs to go down' baskets on the stairs.I have stairs in my apartment, which just become completely covered in things that need to go upstairs or downstairs. For the last year or so, I've started a sorting system with these hard-sided grocery bags. One sits on the top step for things that need to go downstairs, and one rests on the bottom step for things that need to go up. I find that having these designated spaces for crap helps ensure my stairs are clear and safe. When I notice that the stairs are getting full of stuff and I'm in a rush, I can throw it all in a basket, get it out of the way and know that I need to sort it later. (As with any basket system, this runs the risk of just becoming a basket overflowing with random items. But the trade-off is worth it to keep my stairs safe, and each basket is easy to carry around and then sort.)$25.01 at AmazonAdvertisement
4AmazonSkip the cutesy hamper; go for a basket that's nice-looking. (29% off)Clothes have been the bane of my cleaning existence and are always my most clutter-causing items. I have tried all sorts of clothing management systems, and I've found that ditching hampers and just keeping a bunch of good-looking laundry baskets around my home works best for me. So when I'm inevitably taking something off the minute I walk through the door, I can throw it directly into a basket. And when the basket is full, I can bring it down to my washer. It's not about trying to force myself to put dirty clothes from my body into the hamper — that's just never going to happen. It's about having a basket ready when I notice that I can't see the floor anymore because it's covered in clothes. Get it for 29% off. $23.39 at Amazon (previously $32.99)5AmazonGroup cleaning supplies togetherAnother great cleaning hack for me has been buying multiples of supplies — so I don't need to cart individual bottles from room to room — and setting up little cleaning caddies so I have everything at hand. I have a caddy like this under my kitchen sink and under my bathroom sink, each full of the products I need to clean the area. That makes it so easy to just pull a caddy out and have all of my sprays and cleaners together.$18.99 at AmazonThe Real Deal: We use deal trackers and commerce experience to sift through “fake” hike-and-drop deals and other deceptive sales tactics.
