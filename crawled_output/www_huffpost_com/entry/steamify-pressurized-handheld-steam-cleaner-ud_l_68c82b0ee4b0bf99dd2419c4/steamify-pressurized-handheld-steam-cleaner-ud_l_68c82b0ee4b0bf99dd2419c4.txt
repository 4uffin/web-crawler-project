“I read a couple review and was skeptical at first, but my first experience using it was on kitchen counter, back splash and various appliances. When I used it on my dishwasher, it left it spotless and I gotta say, it definitely did as was advertised. It’s super easy to use, super sleek, and super lightweight! I feel having this is necessary and I’m sure it’s versatile and can be used to disinfect so many other things around the house. The heating element heated up the water quickly and I’ll be using it a lot more often. Great product and would definitely recommend!” — Adrian Landa“This handheld steam cleaner is awesome! Heats up fast, blasts out a good amount of steam, and tackles most all clean-up jobs quickly. I used it in the bathroom for the shower, toilet, and sinks, and it made the job a lot easier. I also used it to clean the kitchen range under the grates. It’s like brand new. The attachments are handy, and it’s small enough to lug around easily. Plus, no chemicals needed, which I really like. If you’re looking for a quick and easy way to freshen things up, this is it.” — McGrvy“We got this to clean our car interior to avoid using chemicals with a newborn on the way and couldn’t be happier with the outcome and now use it to clean all the baby toys.” — Jorge“So easy to use! I am 75 years old, so it’s difficult to get on my knees to get the bathroom baseboards, bottom of the toilets, corners of my tile floors, etc Put tools on the end of the extension hose, steam clean, and wipe down with a microfiber cloth! PERFECT! Even hairspray residue comes off! So impressed! Thank you so much for the ease of handling!” — Susan“I have owned multiple steamers before and this one is absolutely amazing. It maintains a high temperature point and has a large enough capacity that I am not having to constantly refill it while I am doing my projects. I found it to be great for cleaning chair rails and baseboards which I found impossible to clean before I started using this product. It also works great on steaming clothing. I highly recommend this product” — mommyandgirls $30 at AmazonAdvertisement
