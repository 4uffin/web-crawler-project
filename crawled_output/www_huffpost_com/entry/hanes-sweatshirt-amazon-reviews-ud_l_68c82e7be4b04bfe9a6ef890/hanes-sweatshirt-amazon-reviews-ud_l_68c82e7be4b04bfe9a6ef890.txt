NEWSPOLITICSENTERTAINMENTLIFEPERSONALVOICESSHOPPINGGAMESThis Sweatshirt Has Over 100,000 5-Star Reviews, And It Starts Under $12 On AmazonThis classic crewneck is ultrasoft and up to 47% off on Amazon right now.By Martha TuberOn Assignment For HuffPostSep 18, 2025, 07:00 AM EDTLEAVE A COMMENTIs too many sweatshirts even a thing? I think not. Not only do I own more than I care to count and have options for literally every occasion (I recently passed one off at a black tie affair by pairing it with a luxe satin skirt, some extra fancy heels, and a bold red lip), I will also never, ever stop adding to my collection. So when I noticed that Amazon was selling this classic crewneck version for up to 47% off, how could I not smash that Buy Now button?$11 at AmazonAmazonHanes EcoSmart fleece sweatshirtAdvertisement
Even if you don’t (yet) share my passion for sweatshirts, please allow me to sell you on this one. First of all, it’s from Hanes, purveyor of tried and true cotton basics. We’ve already praised their t-shirt multipacks and undies, so it’s about time we added their sweatshirts to the list. Second, while it’s billed as a men’s item, it has a classic silhouette that’s designed to feel comfortable on any human form. And it comes in sizes S through 5X, so pretty much anyone can find that perfect fit.Third, it’s equal parts soft and strong. It’s made from the Hanes’s proprietary EcoSmart fleece, a supremely comfy, midweight blend of 80% American-sourced cotton and 20% polyester that promises to stay plush and comfy wash after wash. Double stitching at the neck and armholes, plus sturdy ribbing at the cuffs, neck, and hem, mean it’ll hold its shape wear after wear. Advertisement

In other words, there’s an option for every outfit. Advertisement
Another reason you can (and should) buy multiple versions is the price. At full price, these babies go for a mere $21 each — but right now, you can one for as low as $11.And finally, if my ringing endorsement isn’t enough, then please consider the more than 100,000 customers who’ve rated this sweatshirt a whopping five stars. Feel free to check out some of their glowing reviews below — or just skip to the end and start stocking up.$11 at AmazonAdvertisement
See what reviewers are saying about this cozy must-have:Now I’m a sweater guy and let me tell you this thing is so comfortable. It came it the mail and I was wearing it the next day. Color looked great when it came in no complaints. The size fits snug. The material they used as well 10/10. Better then a lot of sweaters out there in my opinion. – JemiahI love the color, it can be dressed up or down. I may cut off part of the length to make it not quite so long. I typically wear a women’s small or sometimes medium, and I ordered this in a large to be oversized. a medium probably would’ve been oversized enough too. It washes and dries well. – ktxexeI have purchased so many of these - for myself and for gifts! They are cozy without being too heavy. The material is just right so it doesn’t feel stiff when you put it on and it moves well with you. To me, when I purchase a size up or two, make THE PERFECT oversized crewneck but for others that I have purchased for and given them their ‘actual size’, fit wonderfully. great length in the sleeves and the bottom hem. – Kate MargaretIf you want an oversized hoodie/crewneck this brand is it. I have ordered a few hoodies from here but have LIVED in this crewneck since receiving it. So comfy and the colors are a perfect match to the listing photos. Price is amazing and the comfort is unbeatable! – EmilyBought as a Christmas gift for my dad and it looks nice on him! Perfect staple for any closet! Honestly, I’d wear it myself and order an oversized one. Great quality, size, and comfortable + soft material. Highly recommend - it’s a brand you can trust will always deliver a solid item! Would order again in other colors too : ) – Nash$11 at AmazonAdvertisement
