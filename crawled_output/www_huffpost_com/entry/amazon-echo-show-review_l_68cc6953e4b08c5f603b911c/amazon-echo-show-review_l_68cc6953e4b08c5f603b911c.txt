I’ve, of course, spent time with both, and while I loved the first generation (it had a proud spot mounted above my nightstand), the second generation is my everyday gadget right now.$300 at AmazonAdvertisement
Like all Echo Shows, the 15 has a clear, responsive display. This one in particular is a wide 15.6 inches and features a full HD resolution. It can be wall-mounted (the tools come included) or you can buy a separate stand if you want to place it on your nightstand. I suggest wall mounting as it really is quite a large device, and requires a significant amount of space.Once wall-mounted, it looks much sleeker, seamlessly blending into your wall. You can cue it with personal photos or artwork, and even use it as a wall calendar or streaming device — the second-gen Echo Show 15 has Fire TV built in.Nishka DhawanI love the Echo Show because it genuinely makes my life easier.Advertisement
Now, while I appreciate the integration of Fire TV, I don’t really use this device to stream. I have a large 65-inch TV, so watching TV shows on my Echo Show 15 is not why it’s been game-changing for me.I love it because it genuinely makes my life easier. After linking it to my Google calendar, I can keep an eye on my appointments from the quick-to-use title screen. I can also cue up music, get a view on the weather, and of course keep an eye on the time, all by a quick glance at the screen.AmazonConvenient is at your fingertips with the Echo Show's customizable display.Advertisement
That’s not all — all Amazon Echo devices bought after July 8 are eligible for Alexa+ in beta. Alexa+ is, of course, Amazon’s flagship smart assistant, but it can now do a whole lot more.Voice recognition is quick and seamless, and extremely smart. Alexa answered all my questions, could even make dinner reservations for me, and I loved that I didn’t constantly have to call out to hold a full conversation — she was smart enough to keep listening.$300 at AmazonAdvertisement
As someone who’s used Alexa for years, it was nice to see how quick Alexa+ was at responses and how seamless it was to use. Of course, Alexa+ is still a new software, and I’m sure Amazon plans to introduce more app integration as well (right now it includes ones like OpenTable, TicketMaster and Uber).As for the rest of the Echo Show 15, there’s also a built-in front camera for video calls, and a well-placed privacy shutter to keep the lens closed come nighttime. Like other Echo devices, this works seamlessly as a smart home hub, connecting to your Alexa-compatible doorbells and cameras for a full view. I also like that it can connect to my Alexa-compatible smart home plugs and bulbs, for a fully seamless Alexa-run household — yes, I really let Alexa program everything.$300 at AmazonAdvertisement
It’s safe to say the Echo Show 15 is something I reach out to every day. From checking my calendar, to looking for new TV show recommendations, to quickly making dinner reservations. I also want to note that the audio quality on it is quite superb, and definitely surpasses my old Echo Dot by a mile. Music sounds clear and room-filling, and it’s a treat to jam out to the latest All Time Low songs with my Echo Show 15.Of course, given its larger size, built-in Fire TV (plus included remote) and clear Full HD resolution, it’s definitely a pricier Echo Show — coming in at $300. That said, it’s built to last, and the best part, with Alexa+’s upgraded features, it’s an investment worth every penny.Note: Alexa+ has started to roll out to customers as part of the Early Access period. Over a million people now have access to Alexa+. Amazon is continuing to roll out to customers at an increasing pace to make it even more broadly available. Alexa+ costs $20 per month, but is free for all Prime members.Advertisement
Check out some of the latest customer reviews from Amazon, too, to see why everyone loves the Echo Show 15 and helped it earn 4.4 stars so far. (You can also keep scrolling to see more smart home devices that experts recommend – even for technophobes.)“I have owned a variety of Alexa products and so far I think this one stands out for me with its multiple functions. I was all set to buy a digital calendar from another company when I came across the echo show 15. It was a no-brainer to me to get pretty much all the functions of a digital calendar with the bonuses of streaming, music, video chat at a comparable price.” — KMC“This is really a nice Alexa product. Can do anything on here; play games, watch movies, organize, make lists, anything. Voice recognition works well, speakers are pretty amazing, and I would say it’s extremely durable. Long story but it has been dropped about 3 feet several times on ceramic flooring and it still works.” — Christine“I have previously had an echo show 8. I wanted something larger and easier to see from across the room. This was exactly what I was looking for! The value was a little more that I was prepared for, but I decided to make the purchase anyway. I am so glad I did. It is a high quality item, it has a good weight too it and has a picture clarity as good as my TV. I am mostly an Apple user, but I was able to link my calendar to the Echo and it is fantastic!” — Tamara“This product brings a great deal of organization to my life. It serves as a hub for our smart home, organizing my schedules and grocery lists, and even retrieves the weather forecast—easy wall-mounting instructions and easy to set up for your family. The quality of the picture is impressive, and the sound can be thunderous if needed. ” – EMTgirl83$300 at AmazonIf you’re interested in make your home “smarter,” check out this list of seven expert-recommended smart devices that even technophobes can use, previous rounded up by senior shopping writer Tessa Flores:1AmazonA Nest-compatible smart lockAccording to Vitela, a smart lock is a great way to get your feet wet in the tech pool.
