Promising review: "I purchased this product a few years ago from the Apple store and loved it. I needed two more and purchased them from Amazon. The knot moves along the cord allowing you to put the weight where you need it so that the cord doesn't slip onto the floor or get forgotten when you leave a hotel room!
