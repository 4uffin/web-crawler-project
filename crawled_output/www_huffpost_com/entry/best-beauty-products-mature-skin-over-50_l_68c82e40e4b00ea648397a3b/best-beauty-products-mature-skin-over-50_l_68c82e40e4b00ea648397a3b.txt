When I reflect on my earliest beauty influences, one of them is undoubtedly my grandmother, Joan Wells — an eternally glamorous woman with a taste for leopard print, vintage clothes and maximalism, and some of the most beautiful skin I’ve ever seen (not to mention a proud former carrier of a cosmetology license).Throughout the years, I’ve watched her apply makeup and scanned her vanity table’s contents, but it dawned on me that I had yet to ask my grandmother, who’s now in her 70s, her about the beauty products she has been using as of late.

Tessa Flores/HuffPostThe author pictured with her grandmother. Down below, she filled me in on some of her favorite goods that current;y best suit her mature complexion and skin needs. In addition to Wells’ recommendations, I mined some highly informative Reddit threads along with some former HuffPost coverage to help curate this upcoming list. 1TargetA Vaseline-infused advanced repair cream for the bodyIn a very populated "Woman Over 50" Reddit thread featuring a wealth of beauty-related information, one commenter claimed that Vaseline's Intensive Care Advanced Repair lotion has helped make their hands look the best they have in decades, despite dealing with eczema in the winter. This all-over formula features skin barrier-restoring lipids that are essential for healthy and hydrated skin, along with famed hydrators like shea butter and glycerin, a humectant that's trusted for its ability to draw moisture into the skin. And of course, this wouldn't be a true Vaseline product without a dose of the brand's famed protective jelly, which is often touted as an iconic and versatile product for keeping skin moisturized and possibly preventing fine lines. $2+ at Target$7 at Walmart$8 at Amazon2AmazonOlay's Micro-Sculpting cream with peptidesAccording to a commenter in the same Reddit thread, this well-recognized cream by Olay has earned a trusted place in their daily skin care routine, while another 47-year-old commenter in a different thread claimed they've sworn by this formula for 15 years.Now available in a fragrance-free formula, the Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting cream contains amino peptides, ingredients that have been proven to help promote collagen production. This iconic cream also contains hyaluronic acid to provide lasting hydration and niacinamide, a popular antioxidant that can brighten dull skin and even irregular skin tone. $22 at Amazon (with coupon)$20 at Walmart$32 at Target3SephoraAn illuminating color correcting cream with SPFWhen my grandmother told me that this product was her absolute favorite makeup and skin care item in her repertoire, I had to laugh because, for many years. I've emphatically sworn by the same product, just in the original formula. Like grandmother, like granddaughter, I suppose. The It Cosmetics CC+ Cream is a true all-in-one gem that not only seamlessly melts into skin, offering undetectable and natural coverage, but it's also infused with several skin care ingredients, including SPF 50. This hydrating and color-correcting foundation requires very little product to conceal skin imperfections, namely stubborn sun spots, according to Wells. She opts for the illuminating formula, which, she said, feels very light on the skin and best of all, never settles into fine lines. My grandmother even said that she's recommended it to several of her friends. Available in 12 shades, the illuminating version also contains micronized light-reflecting pigments to give skin a slightly glowy and radiant finish, as well as peptides and hydrolyzed collagen to plump and firm the skin. $47 at Amazon$47 at Sephora$47 at NordstromAdvertisement
4Amazon/UltaMy grandmother's famous "stay-put" lip routineIf my grandmother can be known for one thing, it's a signature lip, which she's often asked how she keeps her lipstick looking so crisp and feather-resistant. She attributes it to this two-step lip product by L'Oreal, which features a transfer-resistant and high-intensity lipstick on one end and a "sealing" balm on the other end. Available in 22 shades, this L'Oreal lip formula promises to glide on lips with ease, without settling into lip lines, and feels hydrating and nourishing on the lips. But the key step, according to my grandmother, is starting with a liner to prevent that dreaded color bleeding outside your lip lines. She only swears by classic pencil formulas over the twist-ups, and has lately been using the Signature Lip Pencil by Morphe. This easy-glide pencil promises a creamy and hydrating feel and a richly pigmented color payoff. Find it in 16 shades. Lipstick: $17+ at AmazonLip Liner: $7 at UltaAdvertisement
5AmazonA hydrating cream blush infused with hyaluronic acidWhen it comes to blush, my grandmother uses this hydrating cream blush, also by It Cosmetics, that features a 92% solid skin care serum base, so it does good for the skin while providing a pop of dewy color. Available in three blush shades and three bronzing shades, this hydrating formula features nourishing vitamin E, collagen-boosting peptides and hyaluronic acid to help draw moisture into the skin. $34 at Sephora$34 at Nordstrom$34 at Ulta6AmazonA tried and true hydrating cleanser with ceramidesIt's not surprising that this moisturizing, milky facial cleanser by CeraVe was mentioned several times as a face wash staple among Reddit users over 50 in the above-mentioned thread, as it may just be one of the most recommended cleansers at HuffPost. And, as someone with extremely dry skin who can't handle the oil-stripping effects of most foaming washes, it's my sole cleanser of choice. One board-certified dermatologist previously nominated it as one of the best all-purpose face washes, claiming that this non-foaming, fragrance-free and creamy cleanser effectively gets rid of dirt and buildup without leaving the skin feeling dry and without the use of any harsh surfactants. Featuring CeraVe's signature inclusion of three essential ceramides and hyaluronic acid, this cleanser has 4.7 out of 5 stars on Amazon and over 124,000 ratings.$12+ at Amazon$14+ at Walmart$14+ at TargetAdvertisement
7AmazonA gentle and painless electric facial shaverPeach fuzz and the occasional coarse facial whisker can plague anyone at any age, and for a long time, my grandmother was too afraid to shave her face out of fear of the prevailing myth that the hair would grow back darker and thicker. That is, until her hairdresser insisted she try shaving, which she now does using a very similar electric trimming tool such as this one, about once a month. Using a rotating stainless steel blade, this battery-powered trimmer painlessly cuts peach fuzz and facial hair, without nicking the skin. It manages to glide over facial contours like around the chin divet, between the brows and on the upper lip.According to my grandmother, this helps keep her skin looking as smooth as possible and helps her makeup go on much better. "I feel like not enough women talk about shaving their facial hair, but I wish I had started to do it sooner and your hair really doesn't grow back any darker or thicker," she said.This tool can also be a good alternative to anyone who finds shaving with a dermaplane razor too harsh for their skin, as is the case for my grandmother. $18 at Amazon8AmazonA skin-brightening vitamin C serum with hoards of ratingsAnother product popular with Redditors is the TruSkin vitamin C serum, an anti-aging essential that we're already well familiar with, given its reputation as a recurring HuffPost reader favorite and its sheer popularity on Amazon. Capable of brightening skin, fading dark spots and correcting hyperpigmentation, this affordable formula has well over 151,000 ratings and a slew of promising reviews that purport TruSkin's ability to dramatically improve skin tone and the appearance of fine lines. $22 at Amazon9AmazonA versatile and 100% organic cold-pressed rosehip oilIn recent HuffPost coverage, we wrote about a Reddit thread where one user with the most luminously hydrated complexion – who claimed to be 62 years old – revealed that one of her beauty secrets was a few drops of rosehip oil at night. After speaking with a board-certified dermatologist, we learned that there may be a connection between retinol (otherwise known as vitamin A), the collagen-boosting ingredient we all know and love, and rosehip oil due to its potential to promote cellular turnover, albeit at a less effective rate than retinol. Rosehip oil also contains antioxidants, essential fatty acids, and vitamins that help nourish and protect the skin while also promoting hydration, softening texture, and supporting a healthy skin barrier. The Cliganic rosehip oil is one of the most-rated options on Amazon, with 4.6 out of 5 stars across 26,000+ ratings, and the oil of choice that the above-mentioned Reddit user swears by for their skin care routine. Very reasonably priced, this hair and skin oil promises to use 100% USDA organic cold-pressed rosehip oil that's been sustainably sourced from Bulgaria and minimally processed. Some Amazon shoppers have claimed that when mixed into their daily moisturizer, their skin looks brighter and more even-toned. "I’ve noticed a reduction in redness and dryness," they wrote.$10 at AmazonAdvertisement
10SephoraAn extra-strength chemical peel treatmentWe often hear about the anti-aging benefits of professional chemical peels however, when going into a dermatologist’s or esthetician's office isn't possible, one Reddit user from a Women Over 50 thread uses these at-home, two-step chemical peel treatments by Dr. Dennis Gross. Pre-soaked with the gently resurfacing formula, these individually packaged pads contain a combination of lactic, malic and glycolic acid to help reduce fine lines, even skin tone and texture and speed up cellular turnover. The second part of the treatment contains a separate pad soaked with antioxidants and retinols to help aid in the collagen-boosting and anti-aging benefits. 5 count: $20+ at Sephora30 count: $92 at Nordstrom60 count: $153 at Dermstore11SephoraA cream-to-powder brow pencil that last a long time"After you hit a certain age, it's like all the hair on the other half of your eyebrows disappears," my grandmother lamented. She claims to have found a worthy solution in this cream-to-powder brow pencil by Anastasia Beverly Hills. Available in six shades, my grandmother claims that this velvety-textured pencil lasts throughout the entire day and is easy to apply. And if you have white hair like hers, she suggests opting for the "cool taupe" shade, because it looks the most natural. $26 at Sephora$26 at Nordstrom$26 at Ulta12AmazonA de-puffing and under-eye brightening caffeine serumAccording to one Redditor, this caffeine-infused serum by The Ordinary works surprisingly well for their undereye bags and dark circles.We previously learned from dermatologists that topically applied caffeine is potent in antioxidants and can reduce puffiness and boost microcirculation by restricting blood vessels. This targeted solution for the undereyes contains a 5% concentration of caffeine and EGCG, which stands for epigallocatechin gallate, a polyphenol found in green tea that may help reduce the appearance of dark circles.$9 at Amazon$9 at Sephora$9 at TargetAdvertisement
13AmazonAn advanced night cream with retinolNearly everywhere you look, whether it's our featured Reddit thread or our thorough skin care coverage, retinols will always be among the top-mentioned ingredients when it comes to anti-aging products and for good reason: it's trusted and proven to accelerate cellular turnover, which in turn, boosts collagen production.One Reddit user claimed to use several of Strivectin's age-targeted products, including this night cream featuring a triple-retinol blend and copper tripeptides to form a multi-tasking moisturizer that can address the look of fine lines, volume loss, irregular skin texture and other visible signs of skin aging.$119 at Amazon$119 at Sephora$79+ at Ulta14AmazonA "beauty boosting" cream with SPF 30Sonia Lovett, a 71-year-old who runs the fashion blog Style Beyond Age, previously told HuffPost how important SPF is for the skin. "I like Trish McEvoy’s Beauty Booster cream SPF 30," Lovett said. "It glides on beautifully, disappears into the skin and doesn’t change my skin tone. You can seek out all facelifts in the world, but if you don’t take care of those three areas, you will not have accomplished what a facelift is meant for.”The multifunctional moisturizer promises to offer the perfect base for makeup while also enhancing the skin's natural barrier and shielding skin from sun damage. The hydrating formula also leaves skin with a blurring and soft-focus finish to minimize the appearance of fine lines, pores and other imperfections. $92 at Amazon$92 a NordstromRelatedshoppingBeautyMakeupskincareThese Are Makeup Artists' Secrets To Looking YoungerReviewers Say These Are The Best Eyeliners That Glide Onto Mature SkinMeet The Winning Beauty Products That Earned A HuffPicks Awards SealThese 13 Old-School Beauty Products Are Still The Best Around Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
