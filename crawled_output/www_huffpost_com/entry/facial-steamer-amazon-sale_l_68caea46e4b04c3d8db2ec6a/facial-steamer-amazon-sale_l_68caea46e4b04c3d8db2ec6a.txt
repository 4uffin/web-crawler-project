In fact, we found a facial steamer that one fan says is so seriously refreshing, it’s like giving “skin the facial spa experience in the comfort of my home [—] at a fraction of the spa cost.” This ionic facial steamer can unclog your pores and nourish the skin with warm, humidifying air. Not only does it help skin, it can also help clear allergy issues, and, as one reviewer states, “sinus congestion, headaches, and nasal dryness.” Now that’s a multi-use wellness gadget if we’ve ever seen one. Nab it today for just $27.59 at Amazon — so long as you redeem the on-page 8% off coupon.$27.59 at amazon with coupon (regularly $29.99)Advertisement
It uses warm steam to penetrate the skin, unclog pores and moisturize.With an adjustable nozzle, easy-fill water tank and 10 to 15 minutes of your time, this facial steamer gently pushes moisture your way. Plug it in and tap the power button and the steam will rapidly push steam toward your face. The combination of heat and moisture can help relieve sinuses, like a humidifier, while the gentle steam can help unclog pores and loosen your skin. (Though, it’s important to note: Everyone’s skin is different, so your mileage may vary!)The surprising plus is that reviewers say it helps address nasal issues, which is perfect for surviving fall allergies and flu season.The warm heat can help relieve nasal dryness, congestion and way more. It has a built-in oil diffusing pad, so adding a few drops of essential oils, like peppermint or lavender, also aids in aromatherapy and an extra spa-like experience. According to several reviewers who adore this thing, it’s awesome for clearing any mucous build-up. Some even say it helps relieve sinus infections.Advertisement
“I bought this just for a humidifier,” says one review in particular. “Was just what I was looking for. I place on my nightstand, place a little peppermint oil on the essential oils pad it offers, and in the night when my sinus’s get congested, I turn it on with my face in the steam. […] Easier then taking hot showers for sinus relief or my head over a pan on the stove.”The steamer comes with five stainless steel facial tools.Packed with this steamer are five stainless steel scrapers and pick tools you can use to remove blackheads, acne, whiteheads and more to help with exfoliation. As dermatologist Dr. Azadeh Shirazi previously told HuffPost: “Old skin cells pile up and excess oil blocks our pores, leaving skin looking dull. Exfoliation becomes important as it removes this build-up, allowing for fresh new healthy skin cells to surface.”Though these metal tools are included, please be gentle when using them! Always cleanse your skin before and after use, sanitize your extraction tools and be kind to your skin to prevent nicks and micro-abrasions. (Read more about safely using these tools here.)Advertisement
One reviewer calls it the “best 10 minutes of my morning routine.”“I like to use it once a week at least and feel like it helps to open up my pores and make my skin feel fresh,” raves one reviewer. “When I’m congested, I use this to help unclog my nose to help me breathe better,” says another. “I steam my face to help with the circulation of my skin and to reduce the visibility of my pores. Worth every penny, it’s a great investment! ”$27.59 at amazon with coupon (regularly $29.99)Advertisement

It’s easy to clean, easy to use and the head is adjustable. I have enlarged pores and I suffer from dry skin in the colder months and this has helped tremendously. When I’m congested I use this to help unclog my nose to help me breath better. I steam my face to help with the circulation of my skin and to reduce the visibility of my pores. Worth every penny it’s a great investment!” — A “Works very well. Heats up in a minute or so. Super helpful at opening up my pores. The water capacity is a bit small but still lasts a couple of days at least. I use it in the morning to wake up and put on morning vitamin c cream. At night I use it when I put on retinol cream which is crazy thick so this helps to evenly distribute.” — Sammie Kaye “I purchased this for myself as an addition to my self-care routine. It is a great facial mister and really helps to open my pores in order to extract sebum and other debris. Overall it is easy to put together with simple instructions. You can add essential oils to the little pads that come with is so that you can enjoy the added benefits of the oils while also steaming your face.The tools that come with it are heavy duty, nicely made, and have seemingly held up well over my now couple months of use. It’s also nice that if you’re new to deep pore cleaning you don’t need to purchase an additional tools with this steamer.I wish the water reservoir held a little more but truthfully I’ve only ever had to refill it because I needed to steam more of my face once. Finally, after using this be sure you MOISTURIZE, MOISTURIZE, MOISTURIZE!! And always use sun screen :)Overall I would buy this product again.” — KRomeoLooking for more pampering products to bring the spa home?
