Scrubbing grimy tile and the debris razors and shampoo bottles leave behind can lead to an achy shoulder and back. If you have mobility challenges, scrubbing the shower can literally be impossible because you can’t reach where you need to clean.$21 at AmazonAmazonWet & Forget shower cleanerAdvertisement
Friends, we found the solution to your shower cleaning problems. (On Amazon, of course.) This “wet it and forget it” shower cleaner is a weekly shower spray that gets rid of mildew and scum and keeps it from forming — no scrubbing needed. No wonder more than 57,000 people have bought and rated it (including folks in their 80s, individuals with shoulder injuries, and those that say they simply suffer from “debilitating pain”). According to the brand, the magic is in the customized “non-aggressive” combination of cleaning agents that work in tandem to target soap-related buildup, along with the oils that accumulate from the human body.Right now, it’s currently on sale making it a good time to stock up. If you’re still on the fence, check out these reviews from people who have it:Advertisement
“I am disabled so this product is a game changer for me” — patt“My shower was not filthy, but had alot of hard water stains, especially the doors and soap dish. I was skeptical because I had tried many, many products that, even with scrubbing, did not make a difference. I was very pleasantly surprised to see that after using daily for a week, about 75% of the hard water stains were gone! I now use once a week and they have continued to diminish. This is a real gift since I have bilateral shoulder impingement and cannot scrub any more. I highly recommend.” — Brian Ehret“My shower is almost 40 years old and the pebbly white base is no longer white. I have tried everything in the book to get it clean, including those expensive electric scrub brushes. This is the best thing I’ve ever used! I have told my friends and family all about it. Wish I would’ve bought it sooner.” — Erin Arbour“Cleaning when you are in debilitating pain is awful. Cleaning your bathroom while you are in debilitating pain, horrifying. This helps so much. Like my shower is clean, I don’t have to push myself to clean my shower because this does all the work for me. I love it so much and will forever be repurchasing it. I low key wish that it came in a lavender scent though.” — Sophie Milagros“This worked much better than expected. I had buildup from a while back since I broke my back and was not able to clean my shower. Well, it looked pretty good after one application. I will do one more to get off any residue I missed, but can live with the way it did the first time. I am very pleased with the way it took off the built-up soap scum.” — Bonnie Long“We had our shower stall covered with brownish pink yucky bacteria, which is a pinkish tone and common in Arizona. We sprayed our shower, left it on overnight and scrubbed our grout and tile the next morning. Clean! Wow,100 percent better. Then we did it again, the results even better!!!!! This product really works....” — Marg“I have really bad calcium stains in my show. I have only used this for about 2 weeks, and they are almost all gone. I am going to spray it after each shower and gets better every time.” — Lola M RodgersLooking for more tools that will do at least some of the work for you? Shopping writer Griffin Wynne rounded up products that reviewers said made cleaning easier on their backs:1AmazonThe self-cleaning Bissell Little Green that does all the suction work for you (19% off)When we spoke to 'Queer Eye's' Bobby Berk about home cleaning must-haves, he put us on to the Bissell Little Green.

And I am so happy with my new Little Green. I can't believe I waited this long to buy it. I've had my Little Green about a month now and I use it probably 2-3 times a week. I just got a new puppy and it is no problem cleaning up his messes and I know it's clean and not soaked into my rugs and carpet. I love that I can keep the clean water tank full so that it is ready at a moments notice for a quick clean up and all I have to do is plug it in and zip/zap the cleaning is done." — Michelle S. [This review was shortened for clarity.]$99.99 at Amazon (regularly $123.59)2AmazonA Labigo electric spin scrubberClean grout, stone, tile, hard surfaces, car rims, baseboards, ceilings and bathroom or living room floors with this chargeable cordless electric spin scrubber with a retractable pole.

This product has done both, especially helping with easing back pain from bending over." — Brenda Collier$28.49 at Amazon3AmazonThe Dyson V8 cordless stick vacuum that's lightweight and easy to maneuverCordless vacuums are total game-changers in terms of convenience and ease of use. This reader-loved luxury option from Dyson can transform into a small handheld vacuum for stairs, cars or countertops and can be easily used on ceilings, baseboards and other hard-to-reach places. A single charge will give you 40 minutes of cleaning time and it has famously strong suction to get every bit of mess.Promising review: "This is a "must have" vacuum. I can't believe I've been lugging around a heavy vacuum and a cord for years! The suction is terrific and the first time I used it, it wasn't even on max suction and did a fantastic job. First time I used it the debris canister was so full I couldn't believe I had thought my house was clean. Anyway, it's lightweight. I'm 69, have had back surgery and this is easy for me to use. My daughter and daughter in law have one and I was sold. I got this model because it empties the original way. The newer models require detaching attachments to empty. Research it. I am extremely pleased." — Harvey$379.99 at AmazonAdvertisement

I have arthritis in my lower back and this vacuum is such a blessing. It's light and has a strong suction. We have viral planking floors and this little vacuum picks up all the crumbs and small dog hair that fall to the floor in our living room. I don't know what I would do without it. I'm 70 and have had other "dust busters" of various brands, over the years. In my opinion, for my limited mobility, this one is the winner! Love it" — Gloria J. Tjersland$49.99 at AmazonAdvertisement

I used it on a 3 year old dog pee stain that I could NOT remove. This GOT RID OF IT. I didn’t need to scrub and kill my back arms, shoulders, and hands to get it out. I sprayed it generously since other products never worked, I then used a microfiber cloth and rubbed in each direction for about a minute and walked away. The next day it was dry and there was no stain. Day two, no stain. I am on day five and still no stain. I am pretty impressed. This is going to be my go to for any stain on my carpet." — Kathy$21.77 at Amazon6AmazonA O-Cedar RinseClean microfiber spin mop that you can operate with your footAn comfortable foot pedal that spins and wrings your mop for you and keeps clean and dirty water separate, makes this handy O-Cedar tool a must for easy cleaning.

Promising review: "I've only used the Tineco iFLOOR 3 Breeze Complete a few times so far but I'm impressed. Not only does it clean well and leave a fairly dry floor, but the motorized assistance when pushing forward and back is a game changer. I had a cyst removed from my spine and as a result of the surgery it's hard for me to vacuum & clean floors because the pushing and pulling motion is painful. However, I can clean my kitchen, entry, laundry room, and 2 bathrooms (about 1,200 sq feet) in one session and have no issues, back fatigue, or pain whatsoever. It's amazing! I've never run out of battery power for that amount of cleaning either." — K.J. [This review was shortened for clarity.

Back troubles make it difficult for me to clean the bathroom, especially the tub, and nothing I'd tried was easy enough for me to do regularly. I sprayed this around the sides and over the bottom of the tub, left it overnight, and rinsed it off in the morning. The dirt and soap scum just washed away! There was one particularly bad spot left that I thought I'd have to scrub, but I took a sponge to it and it wiped right off. I washed the tub out with regular soap and water afterwards, just to make sure all traces of the Shower Cleaner were gone. Didn't want to risk having any of a cleaner that strong left in my tub!" — Amazon Customer$20.68 at Amazon9AmazonA shower scrubber 3-in-1 58-inch cleaning brush for getting into hard-to-reach places with easeNo more bending, stretching, kneeling or crouching with this expendable 58-inch cleaning brush.

Simply glide the roller all over, empty the hair, fur and lint from the back and repeat. Promising review: "Where has this been all my life!! I have 2 cats... This chom chom works so much faster and easily than the fur scraper (that you have to hold at certain angle and feels like you’re tearing your carpet at times, and takes forever, unlike the chom chom!) Since the chom chom is great for my chronic pain and mobility issues, I especially appreciate it exists. I don’t leave reviews often, but this product deserves perfect score. I’ve had the chom chom for almost two months and cannot believe I went so many years without it. It so satisfying to get such quick results, be amazed at how much fur it picks up, and the cats appreciate it, too. Get this for yourself and for anyone who helps you clean because it’s the most effective, easiest, and quickest tool!" — RareReviewer$24.99 at Amazon12AmazonA Greenworks 2,000 PSI electric pressure washer that reviewers call "easy"Anyone with a backyard is sure to make use of a pressure washer to quickly clean up their outdoor space.

I tried another brand before buying this one. Greenworks is a bit more expensive than the other well rated brand I tried but worth every penny. It's just easier to manage and everything has a place so all the pieces can be easily stored and moved around together. Does a great job cleaning! So much better than paying someone to power wash your house, this machine is worth every penny" — Ln$139 at AmazonAdvertisement
