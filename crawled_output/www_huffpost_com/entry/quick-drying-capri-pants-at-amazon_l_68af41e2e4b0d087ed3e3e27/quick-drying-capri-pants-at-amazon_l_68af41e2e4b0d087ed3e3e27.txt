I‚Äôve ordered all colors!‚Äù ‚Äî DUTCHMaster‚ÄúThese lightweight hiking pants are awesome! I can highly recommend them! I bought them for a trip out west where I was going to be doing a lot of hiking. I was concerned that they might not breathe in the heat because of the polyester blend or that they might be too light for cooler temperatures. Well...I can tell you that they are PERFECT! They breathe in warmer temperatures and keep you warm in cooler temps. If you are a curvy girl like me, I was concerned about the thigh rubbing together swish. These pants don‚Äôt make noise at all! Thank heavens! Nothing is more embarrassing on a quiet trail than hearing the sound of your thighs rubbing together. The pockets are deep enough so your phone doesn‚Äôt fall out! They fit great and have a drawstring waist so you can tighten them up. They are rugged enough to sit on rocks and not pick the material. They wash great! I am SO happy I bought 2 pairs of them.

These pants were such a surprise! I bought these for our trip to Florida and they are so lightweight and comfortable! The stretch was just enough and they really are my new favorite summer capris! I'm getting a second pair for sure." ‚Äî Erin"Absolutely LOVE these pants! I bought them for work because I regularly have to go outside and denim capris were getting too hot. They are so lightweight and breathable! If I didn't have my phone or keys in my pockets, it feels like I'm not wearing any pants lol. The tie at the waist works really good too. I had to get a 2 XL because I have bigger thighs and but. But with the drawstring they still stay up with all the bending and lifting I do at work. I will definitely be buying more in other colors üòÑ" ‚Äî Liane Mundell$30 at Amazon (regularly $35)Advertisement
