Over the years, the brand has become extraordinarily popular for its selection of minimal furniture with a vintage feel, and it seems like everyone and their funky mom bought the same blush velvet armchair and went through the same “Peggy couch” phase (followed by, of course, the “getting a refund for the Peggy couch” phase). While West Elm may seem like the obvious destination for sleek, eye-catching and nostalgic home furnishings, we promise you it’s not the only one. There are a multitude of online shops offering clean-lined, modern furniture that’s affordable and stylish.Advertisement
