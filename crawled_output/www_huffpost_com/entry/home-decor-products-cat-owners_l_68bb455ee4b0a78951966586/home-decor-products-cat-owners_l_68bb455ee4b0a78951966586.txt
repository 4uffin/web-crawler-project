Woo$25 at Amazon2www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comA multifunctional enclosure in a modern-farmhouse design stylePSST...There's a secret entrance in the very back of the enclosure's open compartment where your cat can come and go as they please. No dogs allowed!Promising review: "We have three very curious dogs who like to raid the litter box whatever they can. This has put a stop to that. For those of you who are having problems finding a litter box that fits, I suggest the Petmate jumbo litter box. It fits perfectly!" â€” Musicalelizabeth$110 at Amazon3www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comA litter scooping kit shaped like a cactus so it can blend in with your houseplantsPromising review: "My friend has cats so I gave this to her. She cannot stop talking about how convenient it is. She love the colors. Love how compact it is. Love how firm the grip is. And it's easy to store." â€” Fiona Moody$20 at AmazonAdvertisement
4www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comAn elevated wicker bed that will fit right in with all your bohemian decorPromising review: "My cat loves this bed! I was looking for an aesthetically pleasing cat bed and this was perfect! Itâ€™s matches our decor while looking classy while still being comfy for my cat. Iâ€™ve had it for almost a year now and itâ€™s still in perfect condition." â€” Placeholder$90 at AmazonAdvertisement
5www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comA floor-to-ceiling mushroom-themed cat treePromising review: "Iâ€™m not one to leave reviews on Amazon, but honestly, I LOVE this cat tree! It matches my room's aesthetic, and my fur baby absolutely loves it too! While I was building it, she hopped right into the smaller hammock on the bottom and hung out (albeit making moving it a bit harder, but thatâ€™s what cats do lol). Pretty easy to set up and with no issue on reaching my ceiling to lock it in place." â€” Mindy Valerioti$110 at Amazon6www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comA litter box going undercover as a potted plantPSA: The "base kit" includes the bottom and top planter pieces, the carbon-infused odor filter, real florist moss, and a faux palm plant. The "essentials kit" includes all that and a removable litter tray that fits perfectly, so that's definitely worth checking out.Good Pet Stuff Co. is a small business specializing in high-quality, unique pet products such as hidden litter boxes and dog travel seats. Their products are made in Kansas.Promising review: "Could not be happier with this. I cannot stand the look of an open litter box. Previously, I took the doors off my bathroom vanity and sewed fabric into a curtain and hung that on a tension rod to hide the litter pan in. The way the pipes were set under the vanity in my new apartment made it so my cat didnâ€™t have enough room to do his business with that setup anymore has taken to peeing in the shower, random spots.. This solved the space problem and looks pretty. Nobody would know itâ€™s a litter box!" â€” Dani$58 at AmazonAdvertisement
7www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comOr an adorably goofy litter matPromising review: "I repurchased this litter mat after my apartment building caught on fire because I didn't want to go without it. It is so stinking cute and colorful and high quality! It's a little smaller than what we need, but it is true to the listing. It's no issue when paired with a larger mat. It's super easy to use, soft enough for my cats' feet but coarse enough to collect the litter from their tracking tendencies. It's a little pricey for the size, but it is honestly well worth it for how cute it is." â€” Emily Tompkins$20 at Amazon8www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comAn absorbent, vegan leather food mat with a checker print designPromising review: "Iâ€™m going through a checkered phase. I saw this and immediately bought it to put under my catâ€™s food and water. The material is thick and sturdy and I LOVE the print. Super easy to clean too." â€” ashinginyourcoffee$14 at Amazon9www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comA strawberry-themed ceramic bowlPromising review: "I recently changed my catâ€™s food bowl to this one because she wasnâ€™t eating out of her old bowl. This has helped her appetite significantly as she no longer experiences whisker fatigue. The strawberry design is super cute too â€” exactly as shown in the photo." â€” Jane Kim$21 at AmazonAdvertisement
10www.amazon.comA ceramic water fountain that could actually pass as a tiny water featurePromising review: "I will NEVER go back to plastic water fountains. This fountain is sturdy and beautiful. The best part? Being able to put the ceramic pieces in the dishwasher. I could never get plastic clean and always worried about mold and contamination. This fountain is quiet, stays cleaner longer, and my cats love it." â€” Yvonne Neilson$40 at Amazon11www.amazon.comAn itty-bitty beach chairPromising review: "Not one to leave reviews but had to come here to say if youâ€™re looking for something cute, modern, and fun, this is it! My cats can now have a pool day with me! Within minutes, we had our first lounger and he loved it. Then there was a fight over the chair...so we have now ordered 2 more for the rest of the loungers lol. Well worth the laughs and purchase! And itâ€™s so fun and cute! Seems like good quality for its price." â€” Pickles25$30 at Amazon12www.amazon.comA set of litter mats cleverly disguised as patterned rugsPromising review: "I really love the look. The larger size is helpful since I have two large litter boxes, with plenty of room extending in front so that any trailing litter on their paws falls off onto the mat before they reach the floor. I am so thankful that they came with two in the package so I can throw one in the washing machine while the other is in use. They wash nicely. It pretty much stays in place, although it is rather lightweight, so it can bunch up a bit when sweeping, but that is a very minor issue for me. I have a lightweight stand-up vacuum in the room that works well on it too. I threw out the rubbery litter-trapping mats that I used to use that were impossible to keep clean. I've been using these for about a month and hope they last a while." â€” Antonia B$30 at AmazonAdvertisement
13www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comA rustic cat grass planter to add some more greenery to your spaceThe Cat Ladies is a family-owned, southern California-based small business founded in 2015 by a mother-daughter duo who wanted to create unique, organic, nontoxic products for other passionate cat owners.Promising review: "LOVE this grass and so does my kitty! Beautiful, healthy, thick green grass grows in a couple of days, so much better than other cat grasses Iâ€™ve bought. Planter is stylish, and the soil pods are so easy to use. Helps my kitty with digestive issues. So pleased. Will only buy this grass from now on." â€” Nicole H.$28 at Amazon14www.amazon.comA huge rustic cat treePromising review: "Love this! It looks great with decor in my home, and my cat loves it too. Only thing I would add is some kind of gripping material for the tops of the wood pieces as they are a little slippery, def donâ€™t dust with Pledge ðŸ¤£. Also pay very close attention to assembly directions and the finished edges on the wood, as we had to take apart the first/bottom section three times to reset a pieceâ€¦otherwise itâ€™s GREAT!" â€” Harley Barnett$170 at Amazon15Mau, Jenae Sitzes / BuzzfeedOr a modern cat tree sturdy enough for even the chunkiest catsBuzzFeed Shopping editor Jenae Sitzes has their Ivy 3 cat tree and adores it: "I was ready to invest in a tree that was high quality, attractive, and a bit simpler, offering the main features my adult cats really care about: baskets for napping in and scratching posts they can claw up. After extensive market research, I realized Mau had everything I was looking for: the quality and durability, the chic modern look, and the option to replace parts that my cats will inevitably wear down with time. Also, you can purchase the cushions and pom-pom balls for your tower in different colors, with some really gorgeous shade options yet! I definitely plan on making this upgrade for my tree soon."$299 at AmazonAdvertisement
16www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comA hanging window perch made out of solid pine wood with thick cotton ropesPromising review: "This might be the best cat product Iâ€™ve ever purchased. It works incredibly well and itâ€™s adorable. I was worried that adding a cat bed to our bedroom window would make my cats happy but totally ruin our decor, but if anything this makes it cuter. Just a complete home run. Itâ€™s super sturdy too, I feel like I could sit there and would be OK! Worth every penny." â€” soledad liquori$37 at Amazon17www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comA fruit-shaped scratcher so pretty that you just might need twoPromising review: "I am one who enjoys spoiling my cats, and this fun orange was no exception. My kitten loves to scratch, jump on top of the orange, push it across the room, and tries to get the stem to come off. It is definitely a fun scratcher for the cats to enjoy." â€” Sophia$47 at Amazon18AmazonA pack of catnip-filled, sleekly designed black and white toy fishThese toys also have a crinkly paper filling, silver bells, and pom attachments for added fun. Your cat won't even miss their chewed-up foam ball.Promising review: "Perfect to place in little nooks and crannies for cats to discover and bat around or carry in their mouth. Satisfaction for the pom lover and the gnawing of felt. Solid design and squeaks less. Good value." â€” d. sciarro$13 at AmazonAdvertisement
19www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comA bright and bold ceramic food bowlPromising review: "The cutest cat bowls ever! The quality is good, and theyâ€™re adorable in my room. Plus, they are heavy enough that my cat canâ€™t knock them over. Would definitely purchase these again." â€” Morgan$13 at Amazon20Seventeen Design / EtsyA handcrafted, Scandi-inspired cat cabinSeventeen Design is located in Ankara, Turkey, and each piece is carefully crafted by woodworker Birol Babacan. Promising review: "Absolutely outstanding customer service, and the cat house is so amazing! Took me less than an hour to put together, and it was fun putting it together, lol. My kitty loves it! I'll definitely be back to order more. Thank you!" â€” Michelle$118+ at Etsy21www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comA rattan litter box enclosureThis product has a litter-trapping mat inside the box, but if your cat is prone to kickboxing the litter every time they go to the bathroom, you may still want to use a mat outside the box to catch any spills.Promising review: "This item is wonderful! Does a great job of hiding a cat box. We turned it around and had it facing the corner of the room diagonally so that our medium-sized dogs can't get to it, but our cat can. It's worked out perfectly! The weight of the litter inside the inner cat tub weighs down the outer structure to prevent our dogs from moving it. This piece of furniture is aesthetically pleasing, also. Made well!" â€” Poulos58$61 at AmazonAdvertisement
22www.amazon.comA litter mat shaped like a retro TVPromising review: "Super duper cute!! I was searching for a mat that wasnâ€™t super basic and grey, and this one struck my fancy right away. The quality is great and super easy to clean. Definitely a 10/10 for me." â€” Jenna Jones$20 at Amazon23www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comA macrame swingPromising review: "My kitty loves his new bed. To get him used to it, I placed several treats on it, and he jumped right in. I used a hook that can hold a 50-pound painting to hang it up. It goes with my aesthetic, and itâ€™s so functional! Great purchase." â€” Lael$40 at Amazon24www.amazon.comAn elegant scratch-pad sofaPromising review: "We have one cat in particular we bought this for since she favors the cardboard scratching posts and is a mix of ragdoll and isâ€¦wellâ€¦'big boned.' Seems all three of our girls have taken to it. Fits our bigger cat (about 18 pounds) alone and could easily fit our two others together if one wasnâ€™t such a snob. Great for scratching too! One of our cats is polydactyl, and she puts those extra claws to work. This couch is holding up well to all the scratching and heavy weight." â€” Mikel$38 at AmazonAdvertisement
25Hilde & Phil, Hilde & PhilA Cat-e-Corner scratching postNamed after designer Jeremy's two cats, Hilde & Phil is a small business focused on creating a sustainable solution to furniture scratching. In addition to the Cat-e-Corner, Hilde & Phil also sells additional sisal scratch pads and wooden risers to adjust the height of your Cat-e-Corner as needed. Promising review: "The Cat-e-Corner we received from Hilde & Phil arrived promptly, was easy to assemble and is of absolutely beautiful quality. It works perfect with our couch and our kittens love it- they are already using it regularly and itâ€™s their favorite spot to scratch. I would highly recommend the Cat-e-Corner to anyone who wants to protect their furniture and do it in style!" â€” Lauren O.$379 at Hilde & Phil26www.amazon.comSome low-key, plastic bowls with a spill-deterring ripple patternPromising review: "This item is PERFECT!! Even better than expected! The quality is impressive â€” it's light, easy to wash (goes in the dishwasher too), and feels much more durable than just a ceramic. It stays in place, is easy to transport, and best of all â€”
it doesn't look like a typically ugly cat bowl, so it blends in like it's decor. I also absolutely LOVE that it's centered around preventing whisker fatigue â€” I don't think many people realize that normal bowls with sides would bother them, but this bowl nailed it on every category! I'm buying another color right now." â€” K. ODonnell $16 at Amazon27www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comAnd finally, a frog-shaped cat cavePromising review: "My cat is obsessed with this bed! I originally bought it for my new kitten, but he literally only likes to lay on hard, flat surfaces. Luckily, my other cat actually likes being comfortable, so she uses it all the time. She's a pretty chonky girl (15 pounds) and she fits comfortably and snugly in the medium size. It doesn't like to stay upright, and the mouth/eyes hang kind of low, but it makes it cozier inside for her. The cushion is removable, so it's easy to wash too." â€” Mars$24 at AmazonAdvertisement
