No matter if you’re in the hospitality industry, a healthcare worker or just need to walk outside in all weather conditions, you’ll find secure footing in this selection of shoes, which range from everyday sneakers to all-terrain boots — each one accompanied by a reviewer stamp of approval attesting to these shoes’ non-slip nature.Advertisement
1AmazonA pair of iconic Timberland men's work bootsThese ultra-recognizable Timberland work boots come in a pro-version, which promises an extra durable construction that's seam-sealed for a fully waterproof wear. Aside from the waterproof nubuck leather uppers, these boots have an outer sole that's slip- and abrasion-resistant even in oil and mud. You can find them in six colors and sizes 7-10, with wide widths available. Promising Amazon review: "I've had these boots for a year now very comfortable, if a little rough to get into. one of the most slip resistant boots I've had, I've walked in literally and inch of grease without slipping. however it is starting to separate from the sole, but I work with some very corrosive cleaning chemicals and don't shy away from stepping in itso honestly surprised they lasted this long." — Jaime$150 at Amazon$150 at Walmart2SorelSorel's waterproof Chelsea boot for womenThese impeccably stylish Chelsea boots from Sorel, available in both a pull-on or slightly modified lace-up design, have full-grain leather uppers that are seam-sealed for trusted waterproof wear and a lightly molded insole made from the brand's exclusive Livelyfoam material. The thick rubber outer sole are treaded and, according to reviewers, can grip even icy surfaces. They come in several colors, including more neutral options and women's sizes 5-12.Promising Sorel review: "I received these boots as a gift and they are perfect for what I need them for. Super stylish with the black leather and gum sole. The upper part is stiff at first but after 4-5 wears they are starting to loosen. I have worn them in icy, snow conditions in Alaska and they have pretty good grip. I have not worn them for long periods of time in below freezing temperatures yet but they keep my feet warm when I’m out and about, and in and out of the cold between errands. I’m considering other colors because I love them so much." — KT$114 SorelLace-ups: $90 at Zappos3Hedley & BennettA pair of Hedley & Bennett and Vans collaboration high-topsHedley & Bennett, a chef-founded brand specializing in gear for the hospitality industry, joined forces with Vans to create these non-slip high-tops that can take you from “back of house” to the streets.

7ZapposHoka's comfort and recovery trainersThe Bondi SR is Hoka's most cushioned shoe yet and has been updated to feature an ultra-grippy non-slip rubber sole that meets the demands of a variety of workplaces and terrains. The leather uppers are also water-resistant. They are available in white as well, plus two widths in women's sizes 5-11 and men's sizes 7-15.Promising Zappos review: "I wear these shoes 5 days a week and while they aren't the coolest looking chef shoe (certainly cooler than Crocs!) they are comfortable and supportive as heck. I've worked as a professional chef for 7 years, working upwards of 50-60 hour weeks. Even after wearing these shoes all day my feet are able to get those extra errands or even a light workout in after the work day is all said and done, pain free! I was using Skechers before this and the support, fit and most of all the non-slip grip on the Bondi SRs could straight up disqualify Skechers. I haven't slipped at all and the larger shoe base keeps me stable. I changed the insoles to some a bit more arch supportive (I am almost flat footed and need some support) Price is a bit steep but it's been an investment for the field that I'm in. I got a half size larger than my normal size but I think these run true to size and a 10 would have been just fine. Almost no break-in period! This is my second pair of HOKAs and I'm already looking at my 3rd for trail running." — AdventureThemmeKimmyWomen's: $144+ at HokaWomen's: $180 at ZapposMen's: $180 at Zappos8ZapposA pair of Birkenstock Tokyo Super Grip clogsIn addition to Birkenstock's signature custom-support cork footbed and classic clog design, this shoe features a grippy rubber outer sole that claims to offer reliable traction. They can be found in three colors, two widths and sizes 4-12 for women and 6-15 for men. Promising Amazon review: "I liked the super grip rubber bottom part that was definitely a slip resistant shoe. I work in a restaurant so it can get pretty slippery back there in the kitchen and this Birkenstock really surprised me in comparison to the typical Birkenstock clog. The only bad part maybe is they run ridiculously big. So definitely size down and the price is a little steep but what is the price of a comfortable foot when you’re working on your feet for 12 hours? The answer is priceless." — Jess$155 at Zappos$130 at Amazon$160 at Birkenstock9AmazonA pair simple shower sandalsThese non-slip shower shoes are soft, flexible and have a rebounding sole for comfort. Made with a waterproof EVA material, these friction-enhanced slippers come in 20 colors in unisex sizes 6-11.Promising Amazon review: "I purchased these slippers mainly to take our new puppy out.

They are just plain extremely comfortable...great purchase for the cost." — Sunshine1949$15 at AmazonAdvertisement

I could not wear them day 2 BUT on the third day I wore them for 14 hours of a 14 hour shift. I pretty much wear these shoes all the time, even on my days off. They are super comfortable and the nonslip is great! These are restaurant-grade non slip, not the woodsy non slip that some other shoes claim are non slip. I can run across the wet tile in the walk-in cooler and not blink. Worth every cent." — AnonymousMen's comp toe: $155 at MerrellWomen's comp toe: $145 at MerrellRelatedshoppingShoes rain13 Walking Shoes That You Can Wear In The RainReviewers Swear By These Comfy Walking Shoes For Daily CommutesReviewers Say They Walked All Over Europe In These ShoesSave Your Butt With These Non-Slip And Slip-Resistant Shoes Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
