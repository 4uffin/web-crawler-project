With over a whopping 87,000 ratings, Neutrogena’s Hydro Boost face moisturizer with hyaluronic acid is one of them. Several users say this 1.7-ounce water-based gel formula is gentle and lightweight, non-greasy and truly helps retain water in their skin. According to reviewer Jeremy Ellet, since using it himself, his “Skin is soft and smooth, like when I was 15, [my] pores look good [and my] skin looks brighter and healthier.”If you’re interested in trying what a 90-year-old deems a “miracle in a jar,” then good news: It’s only $12.09, or 19% off its regular price. You can also grab the gel cream version of the Hydro Boost moisturizer, which has a richer, more nourishing cream-lotion texture to it, for 22% off!Advertisement
water gel: $12.09 at Amazon (regularly $14.97)gel cream: $14.97 at amazon (regularly $19.49)The water gel moisturizer is an all-time fan favorite.Sifting through countless pages of this hydrating formula’s 87,000 reviews, you’ll see customers waxing poetic about their favorite daily moisturizer. Several reviewers say it goes on clear, smells excellent and doesn’t clog their pores. “This is such [an] awesome moisturizer,” says Tossy. “It feels cooling and luscious going on but immediately melts in and doesn’t feel sticky or heavy. I have acne and hate it when moisturizers feel greasy. This is perfect.”The water gel formula has a lighter texture to it, and Neutrogena says it’s best for normal to oily skin. The brand claims it offers up to 24 hours of hydration.Advertisement
The gel cream is a slightly stronger formula.Meanwhile, you can find just as much fanfare surrounding Neutrogena’s water cream Hydro Boost. “I absolutely love the Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Gel Cream!” says one reviewer. “It has a super light, gel-like texture that absorbs quickly without leaving any greasy residue. My skin feels instantly refreshed and stays hydrated all day long. I have combination skin, and this moisturizer works perfectly as a base under makeup or on its own.”The gel cream is much closer to a lotion, applies slightly thicker and offers up to a claimed 48 hours of hydration.water gel: $12.09 at Amazon (regularly $14.97)gel cream: $14.97 at amazon (regularly $19.49)Advertisement
For a daily application that’ll leave your skin feeling hydrated and smooth, consider grabbing one of these jars before it shoots back up in price, and read on for more promising reviews for that extra encouragement.“Never have been a big fan of any large corporate facial products. As I’ve aged, my skin has changed and I’ve tried a TON of products in it. This moisturizer soaks in. My makeup doesn’t feel like it is sitting on top of cream getting ready to flake off. So far it’s the best I’ve found!” — Lisa price “This keeps my face & neck moisturized and feeling comfortably fresh. It goes on smoothly like a gel, and it dries quick. I use a vitamin C + caffeine serum as a second step for added skin nourishment. Then I add a SPF 30 sunscreen. The 2nd step is by choice. I have worn it alone with SPF 30 Sunscreen. SPF 30 sunscreen is important to keep your skin young looking; also to protect against sunspots and wrinkles. I recommend this product. I also recommend reading a bit about dimethicone, which is an ingredient in this product.” — K.Williams72 “Ok so as a regular user of HIGH END products I was originally skeptical of this Hydro boost moisturizer from neutrogena. I recently had my makeup professionally done for a wedding and voiced my concern of dry skin to my makeup artist. She used a beauty blender to apply this hydro boost mixed with a small amount of L’Oréal glowtion- I was WOWED!! (And purchased both) this stuff is remarkable!! I am VERY prone to breakouts and extremely sensitive to fake chemicals smells and fragrances. This moisturizer is absolutely heaven sent! A little goes a long way and it gives me a young youthful glow! I am sooo happy I found out about it and I must say it’s wonderful on its own AND under makeup!!! It is a wonderful product and at a great price point!!” — AZBunny water gel: $12.09 at Amazon (regularly $14.97)gel cream: $14.97 at amazon (regularly $19.49)Wanna peek around for more on your moisturizer hunt?

4AmazonRevision Skincare YouthFull Lip ReplenisherMy former colleague Janie Campbell swears by this Revision Skincare lip treatment. She was intrigued by the fact that it’s rich in peptides, including palmitoyl tripeptide-1 and palmitoyl tripeptide-38, along with other well-researched ingredients like vitamins E and C and green tea and hydrating ingredients like shea butter. After one overnight application, she could see the difference the next morning. It’s a game-changer for anyone who wants to improve the appearance of their lips without going under the needle, and is a nice juicy option for the dry fall and winter months.$44.50 at Amazon5AmazonEmbryolisse Lait-Crème Concentré moisturizerThis multi-purpose French pharmacy staple is beloved here at HuffPost. This emollient moisturizer is famous for not just hydrating the skin, but for offering the perfect base for foundation and makeup. The iconic formula, which includes calming aloe vera, protective beeswax, nourishing soy proteins and skin-softening shea butter, has been a longtime secret weapon among makeup artists and skin care enthusiasts.$17 at Amazon6AmazonWeleda Skin FoodThere's nothing like Skin Food for parched flesh.
