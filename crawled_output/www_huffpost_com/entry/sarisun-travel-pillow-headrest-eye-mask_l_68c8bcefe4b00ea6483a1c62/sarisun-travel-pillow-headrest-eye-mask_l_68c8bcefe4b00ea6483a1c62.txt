But with this pillow, "I slept for over 5 hours straight."By Erica KamShopping Writer for HuffPostSep 17, 2025, 07:00 AM EDTLEAVE A COMMENTAmazonThe Sarisun 2-in-1 travel pillow.Sometimes it feels like trying to catch some Zs on a plane is a futile exercise, but having the right product can really make a difference. If you’re hoping to rest on your next long-haul flight, look no further than this 2-in-1 travel pillow that’s being called a “total game changer for in-flight sleep.”$18+ at Amazon (regularly $20)Advertisement
Designed to prevent the dreaded “bobblehead” phenomenon that happens with so many travel pillows (where your head falls forward because there’s no support for your neck in the front), this Sarisun pillow is made to attach to your seat’s headrest and has 360-degree support for your head. (Just note that reviewers point out that this only works with adjustable headrests, which are on many airlines but not all.The pillow doubles as an eye mask, keeping you leaned back against your seat in blissful darkness for comfortable sleep without need to wear anything around your neck. Best of all, it’s not bulky like a traditional pillow: Rolled up, it’s the size of a pint, according to the brand, and the pillow (along with the included travel case) can fit easily into a suitcase or bag.If sleep on planes has eluded you, you may be skeptical about this hybrid pillow-mask, but shoppers with similar woes have reported some seriously impressive results. “I travel very frequently and have tried [three] different neck pillows that never worked for me. This one works!” one reviewer vouched. “I have used this in [four] overnight international flights for business so far and I consistently get good sleep, and wake up ready for meetings when I reach my destination.”Advertisement
AmazonThis pillow is less bulky and more supportive than many other options on the market.“You want this,” another reviewer confirmed. “This saved us on a trip from the U.S. to Japan to The Maldives and back! It makes sleeping possible on a plane! The sleep mask part is really soft and comfortable (cozy even!), and all parts are adjustable for fit with the velcro style design.” The “game changer” pillow has come in handy for sleeping through most of an 11-hour flight to Japan, a 10-hour redeye, a 15-hour ride to Vietnam and many, many more.You can grab this handy pillow-mask in 10 different colorways, all for under $20 right now. Below, check out some more rave reviews of the handy gadget that could be the difference maker for your exhaustion and pain level during a long-haul flight.Advertisement
$18+ at Amazon (regularly $20)“This was amazing for a long haul flight. I tried to sleep without it but then, I just went agead and clipped it in and put the mask over my eyes and noise canceling headphones in. I slept for almost eight hours straight! It kept my head comfortable and supported with no neck pain, and not hot at all. The mask is super comfortable. Highly recommend!” — Kay“I’ve never been able to sleep on an airplane, even in a Layflat business seat. Took a long haul flight from California to Norway this summer in economy, was dreading it. Was recommended this by my sister, and gave it a shot since it was less than $20. Slept on all four legs of my flight, on my overnight leg across the Atlantic, I slept for over 5 hours straight. Couldn’t believe it. Soft, and the adhesive velcro is crazy sticky. Strapped myself tight, put on noise canceling headphones and crashed out! No neck pain, no tossing and turning or starling myself awake when my head shifted. Held me steady and I felt super rested.” — William Harris“Probably the best pillow / eye mask Ive ever used for travel. Your head will stay upright and won’t get a neck pain after. It does take some assembly when attaching to the seat and headrest of the plane but trust me. This beats every neck pillow I’ve had. And plus it’s foldable and has a carrying case. Love this gadget.” — Hungry Angelo“This thing is a GAMECHANGER! I have hypermobility issues along with chronic neck issues so getting comfortable on planes is nearly impossible. My son and I recently had a 7 hour transatlantic flight so I figured “why not”.This device was so easy to attach to the back headrest of my middle seat (without drawing attention) and I slept comfortably for the duration of the flight.This is a must-have that I will absolutely be bringing with me on every flight.” — Kendra newton“I am in my forties, I don’t travel via airplane very often, maybe 2-4 times a year. But I have a huge problem that I cannot sleep on airplanes. I cannot nap on airplanes. I have tried everything. I recently bought this item because I was going to be on a red eye flight where I really REALLY needed to sleep. It was pretty amazing. It holds your head up in a way that your neck and shoulders and body can truly relax. You can put yourself into it before takeoff, during ascent, during landing. No rules about strapping your head to the headrest LOL. It doesn’t look too weird. I was travelling with my hubby who uses a neck pillow and sleeps but looks super uncomfortable and my teenager who was slumped over the tray table. Poor them. This product isn’t 100 percent perfect but it will do the job. If not sleep then it will at least relax you beyond any normal air travel positions. And if you are exhausted, sleepy or take a sleep aid, you will definitely get at least a few hours of actual sleep. I might now buy this for my hubby and teen :D” — DJPBJ$18+ at Amazon (regularly $20)Check out more comfy travel essentials for flying economy, rounded up by Vivian Chung and Emily Ruane:1A neck pillow that upgrades your in-flight sleep“Travelers should look for a pillow that offers lateral support, doesn’t push the head forward, and maintains neutral neck alignment,” says Lauren Brizendine, director of ergonomics at Fit For Work, when it comes to shopping for a supportive neck pillow. “Memory foam, contoured shapes, and optional chin supports can enhance comfort.”For mid-flight naps and red-eyes, the Ostrichpillow’s Go neck pillow is offers full wraparound support, helping prevent your head from nodding or tilting forward while you sleep, reducing muscle and joint strain and helping you feel less stiff after the flight. Made with high-density memory foam, the Go neck pillow features an adjustable Velcro closure for a snug, customized fit across a range of neck sizes. It also compresses down to about 60% of its original size, so it’s easy to tuck into your bag when you’re not using it.$69 at Amazon$69 at Ostrichpillow2AmazonOr another popular neck pillow with a more compact designThis bulk-free neck pillow may not look like much, but it’s constructed with an internal support system that's designed to keep the neck upright while sleeping. One reviewer explained the mechanics in more detail: “While the picture makes it look kind of like a sock that you would pull over your head, it is really a hard plastic frame inside soft fleece scarf. You put the frame against your neck and little "arms" are on both the top and bottom to keep your neck upright and your head away from your shoulder. It doesn't sound comfortable but it actually is!”$60+ at Amazon3AmazonOr an adjustable pillow with raised sides for added supportA third type of airplane support that’s very popular with Amazon shoppers is Cabeau’s sculptural pillow, which features a contoured design and higher-than-usual sides for top-to-bottom neck support. Another unique feature is the attached rear strap that enables you to fasten the pillow to your seat, minimizing slippage.$40 at AmazonAdvertisement
4Amazon A seat cushion that minimizes tailbone pressure “Prolonged sitting on firm, poorly contoured surfaces can compress soft tissue and tilt the pelvis backward, encouraging slouching and lumbar strain,” says Brizendine. “Cushions promote a more neutral seated posture and can alleviate pressure points.”This seat cushion is designed to reduce tailbone and lower back strain by evenly distributing pressure across the pelvis. Made from memory foam, it molds to your shape while offering firm support. The U-shaped cutout relieves pressure on the tailbone, and a non-slip rubber bottom keeps it in place.$50 at Amazon5An inflatable lumbar pillow that supports your lower backAn inflatable lumbar pillow supports your spine’s natural curve by filling the gap between your lower back and the seat, helping you feel less stiff after a long flight. “Without it, the lumbar spine flattens, increasing disc pressure and muscle fatigue,” says Brizendine. “A contoured shape that mirrors the natural lumbar curve is key,” she adds.The Smart Travel inflatable lumbar support pillow cushions your lower back to help prevent stiffness on long flights. Inflate it by squeezing air into it, then fine-tune the firmness by blowing air into it. Weighing just 5.64 ounces, it packs down small for easy carry-on storage. $28 at Amazon6AmazonOr one that you can secure to your bodyThis adjustable lumbar pillow features a strap that you can wrap around your body to keep the pillow firmly in place. The inflatable design also means that you can customize the size and firmness for maximum comfort. $30 at AmazonAdvertisement
7 A footrest that keeps your feet grounded One of the keys to sitting comfortably is making sure your feet are flat and supported, with the ability to shift and move them around. “For shorter passengers — including kids, tweens, and even some adults — dangling feet can create pressure behind the thighs where the seat cuts in, which slows down blood flow and can lead to tingling or discomfort,” says Kristianne Egbert, senior corporate ergonomist at Briotix Health. “It can also create a pulling feeling on the lower back.”A footrest fills the gap between your feet and the floor, improving leg alignment, reducing strain and encouraging healthy circulation. It also lets you reposition your legs to avoid stiffness during long flights. This Maliton inflatable footrest inflates and deflates quickly with a double cap valve, weighs just 0.8 pounds, and packs compactly into your carry-on. Just check airline policies before use, as rules may vary.$22 at Amazon8AmazonA folding stand to keep your tablet at eye levelThe Flight Flap lets you set up your device hands-free for a more ergonomic in-flight experience. “When looking at a screen, the top edge of it should sit approximately at eye level or slightly below that,” explains Dana Tress, physical therapist and certified ergonomic specialist. “This allows for the head and neck to remain in an upright posture, rather than a flexed, forward posture, when watching or reading a screen.” Looking down at devices on tray tables can cause neck and upper back pain, jaw discomfort, and even headaches, Tress notes. This folding mount attaches securely to seats or trays and fits smartphones and tablets, helping reduce neck strain and maintain better posture.$11+ at Amazon9A travel-sized blanket that does more than keep you warmOne item Tress always tosses into her carry-on for a more comfortable long-haul flight is a child-sized blanket, which is surprisingly versatile. “It can be folded up to be used as additional seat cushioning to reduce pressure on my tailbone and legs. If I am sitting at a window seat, I can also use the folded blanket to cushion my head against the side of the plane when I shut my eyes. Or, I can roll the blanket up to use for lumbar or neck support if my neck or lower back is getting achy,” she says. The EverSnug travel blanket is made from premium microplush polyester. Once packed into its carry pouch, it transforms into a pillow, giving you two functions in one tidy bundle. The 65" by 40" blanket folds down small and comes with a luggage sleeve and backpack clip for easy attachment to your bag.$30 at AmazonAdvertisement
10A pair of shoes that provides long-term comfortThe last thing anyone wants on a cramped flight is stiff shoes that worsen swelling or cramping in the feet and legs. “Shoes with good support and a wide toe box allow the foot to remain in a natural position while traveling,” says Tress. “This decreases pressure and stress on the toes and foot.” When it comes to long-haul comfort, Tress suggests looking for breathable, flexible materials so your feet don’t overheat and your toes can move freely. With the ALTRA Torin 8 road running shoe, its signature wide toe box gives your toes space to splay naturally. It features a responsive-yet-lightweight foam midsole that’s designed to offer plenty of cushion without feeling bulky. A redesigned jacquard mesh upper keeps things breathable, and it comes in 12 colorways and sizes ranging from 5.5 to 12.For extra support, Tress recommends pairing your shoes with compression socks to help maintain circulation throughout the flight.$150 at Amazon11ZapposOr a classic pair of New BalancesIf you’re looking for a slightly more affordable option that’s still going to offer plenty of support, know that New Balance is still a tried-and-true resource for comfortable sneakers — and it’s trendier than ever, which may be a bonus for some. You can get the classic 574 sneakers in a wide variety of colors, and men’s sizes 4-18 and women’s sizes 5.5-16. Standard and wide widths are available too.$65+ at Zappos$67+ at Nordstrom12AmazonA trio of some extremely popular compression socksPer Tress’s recommendation, we sourced some affordable compression socks that can serve a variety of needs. This set includes three 15-20 mmHg pairs in a variety of colors (you can choose from other assortments on the product page). Get them in XS/S or M/L sizes.$12+ at AmazonAdvertisement
