But unlike your run-of-the-mill sun spots, melasma is arguably one of the most clingy and temperamental skin conditions to treat. That makes today’s discovery of a Korean treatment cream all the more impressive. Not only does it come with a host of convincing endorsements attesting to its dark spot-fading abilities — and it only costs $25.$25 at AmazonAdvertisement
Its skin care magic lies in the ingredients.Like all skin care products of magical proportions, it’s all about the ingredients. This Tosowoong cream contains a 7% concentration of arbutin, an antioxidant with brightening properties that works by inhibiting the over-production of melanin in the skin, which causes hyperpigmentation. It contains other well-trusted ingredients in the world of melasma care, one of which is 4% tranexamic acid, which is revered for its ability to reduce pigmentation associated with melasma, without causing any kind of irritation. There’s also niacinamide, a workhorse antioxidant that you’re most likely already familiar with. If you’re not, just know that this all-skin-concerns ingredient can reduce redness, acne, and, most notably, brighten the complexion.

It goes on gentle and lightweight.All of the above-named ingredients are packed into a gentle and light-textured cream that also promises to soothe and hydrate as it treats. For many Tosowoong users, this combination has yielded noticeable results, and in some cases, better results than anything else they’ve tried. Not only that, but one reviewer said they noticed a difference in their hyperpigmentation in as little as two to three weeks.$25 at AmazonFor anyone dealing with stubborn melasma and other skin pigmentation conditions, $25 is a small price to pay for a product that seems to have worked for many. Check out more promising reviews down below.“I have a severe case of melasma that started during pregnancy. I was told it would go away within six months of delivery, but here it is two years later, and I still have it. I’m one of the few who it never goes away for. Prescription creams aren’t covered under insurance, so I’ve looked into several different types. After reading many reviews, I chose this one. Although it’s too soon to know how it treats the melasma, I’m highly pleased so far. The cream is very moisturizing, no need for anything on top of it. It’s not greasy and absorbs quickly. Very light, clean scent. No irritation or redness noted. After a few days, my skin does look more radiant. I plan on documenting weekly the effects on the melasma and will follow up with updated reviews.UPDATE AFTER 7 DAYS: (9-1-25)So I’ve been using this religiously for 7 days (morning and night) and I’m impressed. My skin tone is much more even and vibrant. It’s always smooth and never dry. A small amount of lightening of the melasma, but I wasn’t expecting any results after just a week. My husband says he can tell a difference, so I’ll update again after 2 weeks.” — Abenton“My credentials: acne and PIH for 15 years.My results: 2-3 weeks. It faded my dark spots quicker than everything else I’ve ever used, except maybe a skin peel. I’m usually very sensitive, and I had no breakouts, no peeling, no rash. It felt so soothing on my skin and blended so easily under my makeup. Get it. Trust.PS also works amazingly for lightening your underarm. Idk why I tried, but happy I did.” — Damn it Sam“This cream is seriously amazing. I’ve been using it for a few weeks and already noticed how much smoother my skin feels. It also started fading some dark spots I’ve had for a while, nothing else really worked until now. It’s lightweight, doesn’t clog my pores, and gives my skin a nice, healthy look. Definitely worth trying if you’re dealing with uneven tone or texture.” — Jsha$25 at AmazonAdvertisement
If you’re curious about the products that worked to treat senior shopping writer Lourdes Avila Uribe’s melasma and hyperpigmentation, take a look at her collection below from previous HuffPost coverage.1AmazonA potent serum worth every pennyAs I noted in previous coverage where I sung the praises of this serum, it was my aesthetician who recommended I added iS Clinical Super Serum to my lineup, and now I can’t imagine my skin without it. is an oil-based vitamin C-rich serum that not only has the potential to help reduce typical signs of aging like fine lines, wrinkles and sun damage, but can help to reduce scarring as well. The key is a combination of 15% L-asorbic acid with copper tripeptide growth factors, the latter being a protein molecule that stimulates and accelerates skin regeneration and repair. Along with a couple of other ingredients, these two wonder actives work in tandem to stimulate collagen, smooth uneven pigmentation and even promote healing.Even before the onset of pregnancy melasma, I had a fair amount of sun damage on my cheeks, and with regular use of the serum, I’ve found that it has blurred. Most noticeable, though, is the effect it’s had on my old acne scarring. I don’t have deep pocket scarring; mine look more like freckles or uneven patchiness. Even longstanding old marks are significantly faded now, while newer ones have been almost completely erased. I've kept in in rotation and can't imagine a skin care regime without it. It's worth every penny.$165 at Dermstore$165 at Amazon2SephoraA trio of products developed to target and fade hyperpigmentationWhile I firmly believe that it was the use of all the products on this list that helped significantly reduce my melasma, I give the most credit to these three items from Dr. Idriss. Available for individual purchase or as a set of three, this kit is a one-stop shop for fading hyperpigmentation that includes a brightening serum, vitamin C moisturizer and an AHA mask. The Major Fade Hyper serum has a really lightweight, dewy finish that makes the skin look illuminated upon immediate application, while hardworking ingredients that include alpha arbutin, kojic acid and niacinamide can help to fade long-term discoloration and nourish the skin.Major Fade Active Seal moisturizer is chock-full of vitamin C, an antioxidant known for its brightening prowess. The addition of 4-Butylresorcinol gives it the power to help visibly fade hyperpigmentation while ceramides provide moisture and hydration.The Major Fade Flash mask, while not intended for daily use, is a must in a spot fading regime. It's made with glycolic acid, lactic acid and tranexamic acid, which work together to exfoliate, smooth, even skin tone and reduce the appearance of dark spots. It's the sleeper hit of the trio.I've seen the biggest changes in smy skin since I started using these products religiously. Slow and steady wins the race when it comes to melasma, and these products have been absolute game-changers all around. Not only is my skin brighter and clearer, but it's soft, smooth, supple and hydrated. You can get the starter kit with smaller sizes at Sephora or a set of full-size products at Dr. Idriss.$55 at Sephora$165 at Dr. Idriss3AmazonA serum one TikToker called "filler in a bottle"HuffPost readers love a high-quality skin care product that can replace pricey facial treatments, like this K-beauty serum that one beauty TikToker calls “filler in a bottle.” Its prowess is attributed to an ingredient called PDRN, which is widely used in injectables overseas. It has anti-inflammatory and tissue-repairing capabilities that can improve skin firmness and leave recipients with a telltale glow. It's usually extracted from salmon sperm cells, but Iope's serum has a completely vegan, plant-based formula that is as unique as it is effective.Additional ingredients like niacinamide, probiotics and caffeine round out this repairing formulation — all ingredients that are beloved by HuffPost editors and readers alike. It's such a great product that it was awarded a HuffPicks seal of approval.I have covered countless serums in my many years of beauty reporting, but this one covers all my must-have bases. I've been using it for about about three months and have noticed that my skin is significantly more hydrated, glowy and bouncy. It might not directly be contributing to the active fading of melasma, but the all around brightening and glowy effect has made a big difference in my overall appearance. I'm a convert for life!$50 at AmazonAdvertisement
4AmazonA powerful retinal that doesn't strip the skinAfter finally connecting the dots between prescription tretinoin and my recurring bouts of perioral dermatitis, I was reticent to add a retinol back into my routine — but the popular Medik8 Crystal Retinal 6 has been a great addition to my repertoire. It's a mid-level strength that is powerful enough to be effective but gentle enough to use in tandem with all my other products without negatively affecting my skin.I had long heard people rave about this highly-rated serum, and now that I've been using it consistently, I can't say I'm surprised. It leaves my skin looking and feeling great. Not only does it address typical signs of aging like wrinkles and texture quickly and efficiently, but it's also helped to round out my anti-hyperpigmentation routine without stripping my skin of moisture or being overly harsh. The formula is balanced with hyaluronic acid and glycerin to help keep skin supple, soft, smooth and hydrated. $85 at Amazon$85 at Dermstore5AmazonA jar of AHA toner padsFew items have impressed me quite as much as these cult-favorite toning facial pads. I’ve ditched most of my traditional AHA serums for these bad boys, and my skin has never looked better. These Medicube pads are designed to help exfoliate, balance and brighten skin, reducing oil production, minimizing breakouts and refining the look of pores. They are formulated with powerful alpha and beta hydroxy acids like white willow bark, vitamin C and calming botanical extracts like lavender to soothe skin.The pads are thoroughly saturated with liquid (which cannot be said for comparable items), so there is enough product to treat my entire face, neck and chest. Each pad has a textured side and a smooth side, and I love that the container includes tweezers to pull each pad out without contaminating the rest.I’ve noticed that my skin is softer, smoother and has a really noticeable glow. Most importantly, I’ve detected a decrease in the melasma that has plagued my since pregnancy. They’re incredibly potent, and it’s very obvious to me why they’re so popular. I’ve tried out other exfoliating pads and can confidently say that these are just as, if not more, effective at a fraction of the price.$18.90 at AmazonThe Real Deal: We use deal trackers and commerce experience to sift through “fake” hike-and-drop deals and other deceptive sales tactics.
