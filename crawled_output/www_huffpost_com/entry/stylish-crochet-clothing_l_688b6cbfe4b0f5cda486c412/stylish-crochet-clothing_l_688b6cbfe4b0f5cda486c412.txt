Crochet clothing has been around for a long time, and many people have cultural ties to crochet and wear it often. However, its popularity has ebbed and flowed in the broader fashion zeitgeist. Knitwear designer Alexandra Tavel explained, “Crochet was hot in the ’60s and ’70s, so it’s inevitable that it would come back at some point...The craft industry saw a huge boom during the pandemic, and I think a lot of the focus on crochet really ramped up during that time.” Advertisement
She noted that part of the appeal of crochet is that, in contrast to knitting, the form can lend itself to more freeform, experimental designs that allow for freedom of creativity and construction. However, she added that, “lacework, granny squares, structured bags and simple garments and accessories made with basic stitches are definitely the most prevalent forms of crochet I see on the market.”While Tavel and other crocheters are “excited that their craft is getting some recognition,” she emphasizes that the current crop of mass-produced crochet-style clothing is rarely actually crocheted. Most is machine-knit in stitch combinations that resemble crochet fabric or are used with an embroidery machine that mimics crochet stitching. Tavel emphasizes that “real crochet can only be made by hand” and hopes to educate consumers on the difference between the two types. There’s simply no denying that right now, crochet clothes are a hot commodity, and everyone from big-name luxury brands to popular retailers like Amazon are hopping on the bandwagon. If seeing all this crochet has inspired you to work on your own creations, know that Tavel hosts crochet tutorials and has patterns available on her website.Advertisement
