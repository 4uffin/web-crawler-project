I no longer have to get my vacuum out to give the couch a good clean to remove the cat hair. Since they discontinued the Pledge pet hair rollers several years ago...I have been searching for something similar. This device works in the exact same way, but you can empty the hair once it fills up, and you don't have to re-buy. I put off buying one of these because of the price, but finally decided to just get one. I love it!! Used it over every fabric surface I could find! A must-have if you own pets and fabric couches." — Christina Federspiel"Having two dogs (beagles), there are days when I sit on the couch and get up looking like Bigfoot. Even after we sweep, the dogs roam through the house, determined to undo anything that has been freshly vacuumed. I was kinda skeptical about how well this would work, but it’s honestly amazing! On furniture, this picks up hair better than the plug-in vacuum. We’ve had this for a year and would absolutely buy another one if we needed it!" — Mark B.$25 at Amazon2www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comSome reusable Nippies nipple coversNote: The user on the left is wearing the "Lifts" style.Promising review: "I can’t believe I’m writing a review about nipple covers, but WOW! So I hate bras, and I mean, I absolutely go out of my way not to wear one. Unfortunately, some clothes or places are necessary. I’ve spent sooo much money on sticky bras, nipple covers, types of 'invisible' bras, you name it! Most silicone bras wear out so fast, the nipple covers all end up creating this weird ring underneath clothing, and it’s so not cute, and the sticky bras…just ouch! I put off buying these for months because of the cost for what they are, and finally said, 'Whatever, I’ve spent the same on less!' I can’t believe how amazing these are!! They just kinda suction right on with no ring, no visibility, and NO HURTING! I am buying another pair just to have. Finally, no more bras!" — M. Trout$22 at Amazon3www.amazon.comA vegan exfoliating body scrub to slough away rough bumpsPromising reviews: "I had put off buying this product due to price and figured it couldn’t work that great. But finally bought it after a friend recommended it. It works great! And I already bought a bigger size." — Tasha"I started using this product, and my sister told me that she saw the difference it made on my arms from the keratosis pilaris! I see myself every day and doubted that it had made a difference, but when someone points it out, it makes it clear and feels comforting knowing you didn’t waste money LOL!" — denise.m.l$12+ at AmazonAdvertisement
4Amazon, AmazonA magnetic shelfPromising reviews: "Why did I wait to get this? I put off buying this item for a very long time. Even though the spices would continue to slide off the back of my stove and scare me when they fell. I no longer have that problem as all my spices stay put and are very handy when I need them!" — Rick- E"I wasn’t sure what to expect, but this oven back shelf is awesome. I had a mishap once where a full bottle of cooking oil ended up shattered on the kitchen floor...behind the oven. That’s not even possible now. It makes all my cooking necessities look so nice and neat, it's easy to clean, and it's stable. Really added a nice finishing touch to my kitchen." — Jon & Kel$40 at AmazonAdvertisement
5www.amazon.comA pair of compression glovesRead more about compression gloves and osteoarthritis at Mayo Clinic.Promising review: "My friend recommended these gloves to me because she'd had a good experience, and I love them a lot! I'd been putting off grabbing compression gloves for my RA for a long time, so these are my first ones, and as such, I don't have anything to compare them to, but I do notice a big difference in my hand mobility and pain after wearing these. My only criticism would be the stitching around the thumb — mine has come loose, BUT it hasn't impacted wearing them, so I'm unable to remove a star from it for that. They still work perfectly fine, I just have to fix the stitching when I'm not so lazy. I'm looking forward to buying more pairs when I'm able to!" — Janel$10 at Amazon6www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comA fabric defuzzer to remove lint, pilling, loose strands, and fuzzNote: It requires 2 AA batteries, which are not included.Promising reviews: "I put off buying one of these for like a year — wish I'd gotten it sooner. Very satisfying to use. No notes. Easy to clean. Can be a little loud if you're sensitive to sounds, but I just wear some earplugs or headphones." — Jennifer Cardin"OMG!! This fabric shaver is the best thing since sliced bread! I was skeptical at first, but then today, I shaved all of those pesky pills off one of the twin mattresses in our guest bedroom that had pills all over it. It worked so well and was so easy I started taking sheets off of all our beds and starting 'shaving' the 'pills and pulls.' If you have fuzz balls on things that look so horrible you want to throw them away, don't! Get this little fabric shaver and 'shave' away...lol." — MK$9 at AmazonAdvertisement
7Jenae Sitzes / BuzzFeed, Jenae Sitzes / BuzzFeedA microchip pet feederBuzzFeed editor Jenae Sitzes says, "I've had my microchip pet feeders from Sure Petcare for a couple of months now, and while it was a pricey investment, it's been worth every single penny and has alleviated a ton of stress around my cat's meals. One of my cats, Sneaky, always wants to eat his brother's food and has a tendency to be overweight. Separating them for meals just wasn't working — they would whine at the door and simply not eat enough unless they could eat side by side and have free access to food throughout the day — but I also couldn't be sure that my younger (and much smaller) cat, Chicho, was eating enough with Sneaky gobbling up part of his meals, too. When my vet started throwing around the word "diabetes" as a very real concern if Sneaky didn't start sticking to controlled diet every day, I knew I needed to finally cough up the money for microchip feeders — I mean, it'd be a drop in the bucket compared to the long-term cost of cat insulin. The setup was ridiculously fast, the open-close function works beautifully, and my cats learned how to use these almost immediately. Finally, Sneaky can only eat what's in his feeder, which allows me to control his calorie intake and see exactly how much food he's eating daily — and I can be sure that Chicho is getting enough food, too. This is also a fantastic solution if you have cats on different diets due to health reasons, and if one of them starts eating way less for some reason, you'll know immediately and be able to report that to your vet. I also love that the feeder comes with both split and regular bowls — I use the split bowls to serve my cats both dry food and wet food at once!BTW, I have the basic microchip feeder (because it was the only option in stock at the time), but there's also a Wi-Fi-enabled option that connects to the Sure Petcare app for monitoring eating habits, weighing food portions, and more."Promising review: "It's worth every penny! We had put off getting one of these because of the expense; now that we have them, we wish we had bought them earlier. In fact, within a week of getting the first one, we got a second one for our other pet (two cats). This will really help you with keeping portions under control for multiple animals in one house. It also does a great job of keeping food fresh, so if you have a picky eater who eats small bits at a time, you might find this to be helpful as well." — persephone$172 at Amazon8AmazonA bleach-free, no-scrub weekly shower sprayPromising reviews: "I was skeptical and put off buying this. But I really did not want to scrub the stupid tiny shower. I also didn't want to use a strong-smelling cleaner in a poorly ventilated bathroom. I'm glad I gave this a try. I was able to spray down the shower without fumes. Even to get behind the sliding door that you can only reach from inside the shower. Left it overnight. Feet from my bedroom. Still no smell. Rinsed in the morning. SO MUCH CLEANER! Did it 3 or 4 days in a row to get most of the gunk off. Now I think we'll be ok with weekly spraying." — Sara Wolken"We cannot BEGIN to tell you what a lifesaver this is! We have two old fiberglass tubs with vinyl shower enclosures that, no matter what amount of scrubbing we have done with everything from bleach to cleanser to vinegar and baking soda, would NOT come clean. After I took my shower last night, I sprayed down the tub and walls. Within minutes, all the built-up water deposits, dirt, and grime began to melt away in front of my eyes. I left it on overnight, and when I got up this morning, it did not look like the same tub and shower. This product is a godsend, especially for old folks like us who have difficulty getting down on our hands and knees and scrubbing anything. More importantly, it performs as advertised. We plan on using it as part of our weekly cleanup routine. This is truly an overnight sensation!" — Amazon Customer$21 at Amazon9www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comA bottle of Olaplex No. 3, a splurge-worthy repairing treatmentI went from very dark brown/almost black Asian hair to platinum blonde, a color I've maintained for almost four years. I truly believe the only reason I still have hair on my head is because 1. my colorist is amazing and 2. Olaplex. Despite having pretty strong hair, I remember globs of it breaking off in the shower right after I bleached my mane. In a panic, I bought a bottle of Olaplex and my hair has been thanking me ever since. I hate how expensive a single small bottle is, but I truly can't be without this. It's reduced breakage and brittleness, minimized frizziness, and just generally helped my hair look healthy. Promising review: "This product is amazing. I’ve been meaning to buy it for a while but the price always threw me off. It’s not a conditioner but rather a protein and hair bonding treatment. I put this stuff on when I’m coloring my roots. I soak the ends and slap this stuff on generously on the ends of my hair and it instantly erased my split ends and makes the hair stronger. If used wrong it can fry the hair." — Bathsheba$30 at AmazonAdvertisement
10Amazon, www.amazon.comA Laneige overnight lip maskPromising review: "I have extremely dry, chapped, 43-year-old wrinkly lips. I have used many lip balms, Aquaphor, Vaseline, etc., but nothing works to my satisfaction. I had been putting off getting the Lanegie as it did not fit my budget. I finally gave in (after using their toner and falling in love), and I'm so glad I did. I use a tiny bit at night, and my lips truly feel better the next morning. It’s only been two days; hopefully, the results stay. I plan on using this every night before bed. I will also be trying this out before I use my lipstick in the morning; a really tiny bit should help. Let’s see how that works, will update with the results. But so far, loving it as a sleeping lip mask." — Nima$24 at Amazon11AmazonA desk-friendly HappyLight sunlampRead more about sunlamps and seasonal affective disorder (SAD) at Cleveland Clinic and Mayo Clinic. Promising reviews: "I was told by a doctor when I was 12ish years old that I needed a lamp. Fast forward 18 miserable winters, and I purchased this. I live in Minnesota, so when I say miserable, I really, really mean it. I use it every morning right after waking up for about 30 minutes with the high energy lens. I've been using it for a few weeks, and I'm sleeping through the night again (this was the first thing I noticed just after a few days), and I feel friendlier and more tolerant of stress than I was before using it. I'm very glad that I finally splurged on the expensive lamp I've been putting off purchasing for so long." — Rachel Merry "I work from home at night. I never see the light of day during the winter. This light has been a joy to have and gives great light at my desk to work with, with the benefit of mimicking sun exposure. It’s very easy to use and to replace bulbs." — Amazon Customer$60 at Amazon12www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comAn off-shoulder jumpsuitPromising review: "This is my very first romper-type clothing purchase. I had been putting it off because I was afraid it wouldn't look right on me, but I decided to try this one, and I'm so glad I did! It's sooo comfortable and stretchy and looks cute!" — Jen$36+ at AmazonAdvertisement
13www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comA reviewer-beloved veggie chopperPromising review: "I have put off a purchase of one of these for years. I didn't think I needed it, nor would I use it, because I could cut up everything with a knife just as quickly. Man, was I wrong! This thing is quick and easy to use. There is no knife sharpening involved. Just cut food into manageable chunks and all is well. I made a fantastic salad the other day in about two minutes with romaine lettuce, cucumbers, onions, and tomatoes. And I could eat it right from the container I chopped it into. What a world!" — K.Cook$30 at Amazon14www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comAn ultra-hydrating overnight collagen sheet maskPromising review: "The products currently slung on social media can sometimes seem over hyped or overexaggerated, but this product is not one of them. We’ve all seen the videos and pictures of the overnight wonder mask before and after, which leaves skin looking as slick and clean as glass or a mirror. Thinking it was another over-circulated product, I put off buying this until I came across it again and thought I might give it a try. We’ll let me tell you…it’s all true. This mask wasn’t hyped up enough!!!! I had several people ask me why I was literally glowing today, my skin was truly glassy with a glow-from-within vibe, and my usual frets about my skin were all but gone. My nose pores tightened up to a pre-adolescent level, the overall texture of my skin was so smooth and even, and my tired, sunken, dark eyes had been rejuvenated to a point where I genuinely could not remember the last time they looked THAT good. The quality is amazing and so easy to use." — Estrella Martinez$18 at Amazon15www.amazon.com, www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comA contoured sleep mask to block out the sunlightPromising review: "I am the type of person who wakes up with a headache if there is even a sliver of light poking through a crack. For months, I have put off purchasing another sleep mask until now. I used the mask last night for the first time, and it was the first time in months that I’ve gotten a full eight hours of uninterrupted rest. I will be buying another one just in case I lose this one, because I don’t want another night of bad sleep without this. Thank you for making a great mask. Buy this mask if you want a great product that does the job well!" — Brandon$17 at AmazonAdvertisement
16www.amazon.comA Bissell Little Green machinePromising review: "I put off buying this for whatever reason, welp, I finally caved and bought. The only question I ask myself is, 'Why did I wait so long?!!!' If you have children or pets, you need this. If you have both, buy it and overnight it! My daughter decided to eat Nutella and yogurt in her chair, and this lovely machine cleaned it all up. It might take a few times back and forth using it, but it will come out. There was a wonky stain on the arm of the sofa (not sure what it was, where it came from, or who did it), but it got that out, too! Our dog pooped on the floor, and my 2-year-old managed to step in it and smear it. Good times! This thing got it up without me having to scrub it! You seriously won't regret buying this, you'll only regret not buying it sooner! It's a lifesaver for you, your home, your marriage, just buy it!" — Brynne$100 at Amazon17www.amazon.comA tiny toenail brace for ingrown toenailsThis comes with a kit containing 10 toenail braces and tools for application. Each brace lasts 3–6 weeks. Promising reviews: "I put off trying this solution for months, and I wish I could go back in time to tell myself to order this product. The relief was noticeable after the first night, and I have had no discomfort since then. The nail continues to grow properly and has saved me from going to a specialist to have my toe dealt with. Game changer." — Anjuju"I’ve only been using these for a few days, and I see a massive improvement. They do what they say they will do. I didn’t think it was going to work when I had it in front of me. How was this hard, small stick going to become a Breathe Right strip for my toe? And yet, it totally did what it said it would. I put off this purchase for so long because it was more money than I wanted to spend on something that might not work. Finally figured I was worth the risk — and it was basically the cost of a copay. I wish I had bought this kit sooner." — Margaret F.$45 at Amazon18www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comA professional-level grooming kitIt comes with a grooming brush, a de-shedding tool, a trimming tool, a nozzle head, and a cleaning brush.Promising review: "I've been putting it off because this shaver was so expensive, and if it didn't work well (as all other ones I bought have been), then I was gonna throw in the proverbial towel and just take him to get groomed. But I was scared to do that also because they require a lot of shots and he's so old and has diabetes and I don't know if the shots would wind up making him sick or running his blood sugars up, etc... Anywho, OMG this shaver is COMPLETELY WORTH EVERY PENNY!!! I shaved him in less than an hour (completely unheard of!!!), and it did all the work basically!!! The vacuum sucks the hair toward the clippers so you get a better cut. It's the only clipper that literally just glided through his fur with absolutely no problem or drag! It never cut him either! There is definitely a learning curve with it because if you use it without the guards, the vacuum will pull his skin towards the clippers and you'll get an uneven cut, BUT it will not nick the skin...like no matter what I did, he was fine. It also sucked his dander into it!!! Whenever I shave him, he always has thick dander on his back, but the shaver actually just sucked it all up into it!!! We bathe him afterwards anyway, but holy cow, that was quick, easy, and did a better cut than literally ALL THE OTHER TRIMMERS!!! Oh, and it's not loud. It does make some noise, but not a lot. We were really impressed with that also!!!" — Mandy Muffley$85 at AmazonAdvertisement
19www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comA cold brew maker if coffeeIt brews a quart (4 cups), so you should have enough java to get you through the day (and maybe some left over to share with your favorite coworker).Promising reviews: "Great cold brew system! We had been putting off getting one for so long. We have a Keurig and simply put brewed coffee in the fridge overnight. But as our Keurig seems to be dying, it was time to explore other options. I wish we had done it sooner! This system is so easy to use — add your coffee of choice and water, place it in the fridge, and wait for the next day. That's it!! So easy, great tasting coffee that goes far enough for both of us. It easily fits on a shelf or the door. We're considering buying a second because of how much coffee my husband drinks, or if we have company." — Jess"If you LOVE iced coffee (I drink it year-round regardless of the weather), then you NEED this cold brewer. I work for Starbucks, and I love our cold brew. I was skeptical about making it at home, but I love it more than theirs. It’s especially nice since Starbucks only brews one kind of beans for cold brew, but at home, you can brew your favorite kind. Absolutely love this, and it’s worth more than it costs. A must-buy for yourself or a wonderful gift for the coffee lover in your life!" — j.blaine$25 at Amazon20www.amazon.comA jewelry cleaning pen so you can revive the sparkle of your gemsPromising review: "I feel like I got a brand new ring. I have only had my engagement ring for seven months and put off buying a cleaner, and now my only regret is that I should have bought it sooner! This will be a gift I give to all my newly engaged friends from here forward!" — chelsea c$9 at Amazon21www.amazon.comA cruelty-free lengthening mascaraPromising review: "I put off buying this mascara for so long because I'm so dedicated to my favorites. But my favorites have been becoming more expensive every year, and the quality seems to be getting worse. I saw this brand on a TikTok video and figured I'd give it a shot. After all, $5 is nothing for makeup. I am SO glad I did. It's amazing. No stickiness or flimsiness once applied. It takes so little to get amazing results, and it doesn't clump or flake off. I absolutely love it." — Megan$5 at AmazonAdvertisement
