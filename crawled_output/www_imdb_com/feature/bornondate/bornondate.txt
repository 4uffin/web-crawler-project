Poppy GilbertActressThe Catch (2023– )Poppy Gilbert, hailing from the vibrant landscapes of Sweden, has carved a niche in the entertainment industry with her magnetic presence and chameleonic ability to inhabit roles that defy expectation. Rising to prominence through a blend of raw talent and relentless curiosity, she first turned heads in Swedish indie cinema, where her performances in gritty, character-driven films showcased a depth that belied her years. Her breakthrough came with a haunting portrayal of a disillusioned musician in Northern Lights , a film lauded for its poetic realism, which catapulted her into international conversations and earned her a spot on the festival circuit's "ones to watch" lists. From there, Gilbert pivoted seamlessly between genres, trading the stark intimacy of art house projects for the high-stakes glamour of mainstream thrillers, including a scene-stealing role as a morally ambiguous spy in the action-packed Shadow Protocol . Yet she remains fiercely committed to artistic evolution, often collaborating with emerging directors to champion stories that interrogate identity and resilience, such as her recent stint producing and starring in a boundary-pushing web series exploring queer narratives in rural Scandinavia. Beyond the screen, her advocacy for sustainable filmmaking and mentorship of underrepresented voices in the industry has solidified her reputation as a trailblazer who values substance as much as spectacle. With a career marked by bold choices and an unapologetic authenticity, Gilbert continues to redefine what it means to be a global artist-rooted in her Nordic heritage yet endlessly reaching toward new creative frontiers.14.

He went on to reprise that role in all 7 of the original Star Trek movies (The 7th movie, Star Trek: Generations (1994) was mostly ST: The Next Generation, but had the original series section at the beginning, and Kirk at the end), as well as voicing the same character in several of the video games.

Since it was Fan-Made (and to avoid violating studio rights) they couldn't use the Star Trek Character's names, like Uhura or Chekov, so they simply called him 'The Admiral'.

Zoe CaldwellActressExtremely Loud & Incredibly Close (2011)As a testament to her remarkable talent, Broadway honored esteemed
Australian stage actress Zoe Caldwell four times with Tony Awards: for "Slapstick
Tragedy" (1966), for her title role in "The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie"
(1968), for her searing title performance as "Medea" (1982), and as opera
diva Maria Callas in "Master Class" (1995). The classical stage legend's fervent dedication to the theatre, however, came at the expense of filmgoers everywhere as she made only three rather insignificant movies during her lifetime.Zoe Ada Caldwell was born in Hawthorn, Australia, on September 14, 1933, and began her professional career at the tender age of 9 in a production of"Peter Pan." Finding radio work in her teens, her parents provided her with the necessary foundation with lessons in dance, elocution and music. She left school at age 15 and began an early career teaching speech and performing on a children's radio program.Attending the Methodist Ladies College in Melbourne, she was one of the original members of Melbourne's Union Theatre Repertory Company (1953) and with the Elizabeth Theatre Trust (1954-1957). Years of repertory work followed in which she built up quite a formidable resume. Appearing for two seasons with the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre Company in productions of "Pericles" and "Much Ado About Nothing." She also toured Russia with the latter company in "Hamlet," "Twelfth Night" and "Romeo and Juliet."For the next few years she built up her classical resume as Biance in "Othello," "Helena in "All's Well That Ends Well," a Fairy in "A Midsummer Night's Dream," Cordelia in "King Lear," Rosaline in "Love's Labour's Lost," Ismene in "Antigone," Pegeen in "Playboy of the Western World" and the title role in "Saint Joan."In America, Zoe helped launch Minneapolis' Tyrone Guthrie Theatre in 1963, with roles in "The Miser" and "The Three Sisters." Elsewhere she appeared as the title role of "Mother Courage," as well as "The Mad Woman of Chaillot," "The Way of the World" and "The Caucasian Chalk Circle," ". Broadway finally opened its curtains for her in 1965 when she briefly replaced Anne Bancroft in "The Devils." She continued her round of Broadway standing ovations with extraordinary performances as Eve in "The Creation of the World and Other Business" (1972: produced by the renown Robert Whitehead, her husband from 1968 on), "Dance of Death" (1974) and as Lillian Hellman in "Lillian" (1986), in addition to her Tony-winning perfs.As a now-prestigious stage director, she helmed or assisted in productions of "An Almost Perfect Person" (1977, her debut), "Othello" (1982) starring James Earl Jones, Christopher Plummer, "Macbeth" (1988) starring Plummer and Glenda Jackson and "Park Your Car in Harvard Yard" (1991) starring Judith Ivey and Jason Robards. She also directed Eileen Atkins and Vanessa Redgrave in the 1994 off-Broadway romantic drama "Vita and Virginia."To the dismay of film-winning audiences, Ms. Caldwell avoided the silver screen almost completely. She appeared briefly as the Countess in the Woody Allen romantic comedy The Purple Rose of Cairo (1985), a featured role (Mrs. Hill) in the fantasy mystery Birth (2004) starring Nicole Kidman, and her final role as the Grandmother in the Tom Hanks/Sandra Bullock adventure drama Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close (2011).Television appearances would also be comparatively few but she did display from time to time her classical brilliance in such roles ask the Fairy in A Midsummer Night's Dream (1959); Lady Macbeth in Macbeth (1961) opposite Sean Connery; legendary actress Mrs. Patrick Campbell in Dear Liar (1964); another early legendary actress Sarah Bernhardt in Great Performances (1971) and Catherine the Great in Witness to Yesterday (1973). More notably, she recreated her Tony-winning role of Medea (1983)She and producer/husband Whitehead maintained a long and successful private and professional partnership. The couple had two children: William "Sam" and Charles, the latter taking the role of producer of "The Play What I Wrote" which briefly featured his mother in New York in 2003. Suffering from Parkinson's disease, the 80-year-old actress died of complications on February 16, 2020.17.

Faith FordActressProducerSoundtrackThe Pacifier (2005)Her classic beauty, combined with wit and comedic talent, earned Ford five Emmy nominations and two consecutive Golden Globe Award nominations for her ten-year portrayal of reporter 'Corky Sherwood' on the CBS series "Murphy Brown." Prior to Murphy Brown, Ford landed a reoccurring role playing a fumbling secretary named Janine on "Thirtysomething". Ford also starred in the ABC hit comedy series "Hope & Faith" with Kelly Ripa for three seasons and later co-starred opposite Fred Goss and Jerry O'Connell in the ABC comedy series, "Carpoolers." Ford has a wide range of guest starring roles, from "My Name is Earl", "Criminal Minds" to "The Middle" and also co-starred opposite Vin Diesel in Touchstone Pictures' "The Pacifier, " and "Prom." Ford has starred in several TV movies, ABC Family's "Mom's on Strike", NBC/Walmart movie "Field of Vision", Hallmark movies, "A Kiss at Midnight", "Trading Christmas" and "The Bridge 1 and 2" along with Lifetime movies, "Sorority Wars" and 2017' "Christmas in Mississippi." Faith co-starred and produced a feature thriller, "Escapee", starring Dominic Purcell and Christine Evangelista along with producing the well-received short films, "Citation of Merit" and "The Day I Finally Decided to Kill Myself".
In addition to her acting career, Ford made her writing debut in 2004 with an exciting cookbook, "Cooking With Faith", co-written with Melissa Clark. This multi-generational Southern cookbook draws on Ford's childhood in Louisiana where she learned how to cook down-home food at the knees of her Grandmother and Mother. Along with the traditional family recipes, the cookbook includes updated healthier versions sprinkled with familiar anecdotes of good ole' Southern hospitality and charm.
Ford never forgot her roots being raised in the quiet community of Pineville, Louisiana. In high school, Faith acted in school plays, and in her senior year she was a finalist in Teen Magazine's annual model search. Faith moved to New York City when she was 17 where she worked in commercials, took acting classes, and did some modeling. Ford was 18 when she landed a role on the soap "Another World," and later "One Life to Live." Faith continues to act and produce films and television.21. Nicol WilliamsonActorAdditional CrewSoundtrackExcalibur (1981)Nicol Williamson was an enormously talented actor who was considered by
some critics to be the finest actor of his generation in the late 1960s
and the 1970s, rivaled only by
Albert Finney, whom Williamson bested in
the classics. Williamson's 1969 "Hamlet" at the Roundhouse Theatre was
a sensation in London, considered by many to be the best limning of
The Dane since the definitive 20th-century portrayal by
John Gielgud, a performance in that period,
rivaled in kudos only by
Richard Burton's 1964 Broadway
performance. In a sense, Williamson and Burton were the last two great
Hamlets of the century. Finney's Hamlet was a failure, and while
Derek Jacobi's turn as The Dane was widely
hailed by English critics, he lacked the charisma and magnetism -- the
star power -- of a Williamson or Burton.Playwright John Osborne, whose play
"Inadmissible Evidence" was a star vehicle for Williamson in London's
West End and on Broadway, called him "the greatest actor since
Marlon Brando." While it was unlikely that
Williamson could ever achieved the film reputation of Brando (who but
Brando did?) or the superstar status that Burton obtained and then
lost, his inability to maintain a consistent film career most likely is
a result of his own well-noted eccentricities than it is from any
deficiency in acting skills.The great critic and raconteur
Kenneth Tynan
(Laurence Olivier's first dramaturg at
the National Theatre) wrote a 1971 profile of Williamson that
elucidated the problem with this potentially great performer.
Williamson's Hamlet had wowed Prime Minister
Harold Wilson, and Wilson in
turn raved about his performance to President
Richard Nixon. Nixon invited Williamson to
stage a one-man show at the White House, which was a success. However,
in the same time period, Williamson's reputation was tarred by his
erratic behavior during the North American tour of "Hamlet". In Boston
he stopped during a performance and berated the audience, which led one
cast member to publicly apologize to the Boston audience. Williamson
would be involved in an even more famous incident on Broadway a
generation later.Even before the Boston incident, Williamson had made headlines when,
during the Philadelphia tryout of "Inadmissible Evidence," he struck
producer David Merrick whilst
defending Anthony Page. In 1976 he slapped a fellow actor during the
curtain call for the Broadway musical "Rex." Fifteen years later, his
co-star in the Broadway production of "I Hate Hamlet" was terrified of
him after Williamson whacked the actor on his buttocks with a sword,
after the actor had abandoned the choreography.A great stage actor, who also did a memorable "Macbeth" in London and
on Broadway, Williamson was twice nominated for Tony Awards as Best
Actor (Dramatic), in 1966 for Osborne's "Inadmissible Evidence" (a
performance he recreated in the film version) and in 1974 for a revival
of "Uncle Vanya." On film, Williamson was superb in many roles, such as
the suicidal Irish soldier in
The Bofors Gun (1968) and
Tony Richardson's
Hamlet (1969). He got his chance playing
leads, such as Sherlock Holmes in
The Seven-Per-Cent Solution (1976)
and Castle in Otto Preminger's
The Human Factor (1979), and
was competent if not spectacular, likely diminished by deficiencies in
the scripts rather than his own talent. Richardson also replaced
Williamson's rival as Hamlet, Burton, in his adaptation of
Vladimir Nabokov's
Laughter in the Dark (1969).It was in supporting work that he excelled in film in the 1970s and
1980s. He was quite effective as a supporting actor, such as his Little
John to Sean Connery's Robin Hood in
Richard Lester's
Robin and Marian (1976), was
brilliant in
I'm Dancing as Fast as I Can (1982)
and gave a performance for the ages (albeit in the scenery-chewing
category as Merlin) in
Excalibur (1981). His Merlin lives on
as one of the most enjoyable performances ever caught on film.Then it was over. While the film work didn't dry up, it didn't reach
the heights anymore. He failed to harness that enormous talent and
convert it into memorable film performances. He did good work as
Louis Mountbatten in a 1986 TV-movie,
but the roles became more sporadic, and after 1997 this great actor no
longer appeared in motion pictures.Williamson's eccentricities showed themselves again in the early 1990s.
When appearing as the ghost of
John Barrymore in the 1991
Broadway production of Paul Rudnick's "I
Hate Hamlet" on Broadway in 1991, Williamson's co-star quit the play
after being thumped on the buttocks with a sword during a stage fight.
Although critics hailed the performances of the understudy as a "vast
improvement" it caused a sensation in the press. Despite good reviews,
the play lasted only 100 performances.Surprisingly, Williamson never won an Oscar nomination, yet that never
was a game he seemed to play. In 1970, after his Hamlet triumph, he
turned down a six-figure salary to appear as Enobarbus in
Charlton Heston's film of Shakespeare's
Antony and Cleopatra (1972)_. The role was played by
Eric Porter, but his choice was
justified in that the film was derided as a vanity production and
savaged by critics).Williamson had been a staple on Broadway, even using his fine singing
voice to appear as Henry VIII in the Broadway musical "Rex" In 1976. He
has not appeared on the Great White Way since his own one-man show
about John Barrymore that he himself crafted, "Jack: A Night on the
Town with John Barrymore," which had enormously successful runs, both
at the Criterion Theater in London, and The Geffen Theater in Los
Angeles playing to packed houses, before closing on Broadway after only
12 performances in 1996.The "I Hate Hamlet" and "Jack" shows are still talked about on
Broadway. Williamson has joined the ranks of Barrymore, Burton, and
Brando, in that they have become phantoms who haunt the theater and
film that they they served so admirably on the one hand but failed on
the other. All enormously gifted artists, perhaps possessed of genius,
they were discombobulated by that gift that became their curse, the
burden of dreams -- the dreams of their audiences, their collaborators,
their critics. While there is a wistfulness over the loss of such
greatness, there is a relief offered, not so much from a moral tale,
but as a release from guilt for the run-of-the-mill artists lacking
such genius. One can be comforted by the fact that while one lacks the
pearl of such a talent, they also lack the irritating genius that
engenders that pearl.22. Jack HawkinsActorProducerBen-Hur (1959)In Britain, special Christmas plays called pantomimes are produced for
children. Jack Hawkins made his London theatrical debut at age 12,
playing the elf king in "Where The Rainbow Ends". At 17, he got the
lead role of St. George in the same play. At 18, he made his debut on
Broadway in "Journey's End". At 21, he was back in London playing a
young lover in "Autumn Crocus". He married his leading lady,
Jessica Tandy. That year he also played
his first real film role in the 1931 sound version of
Alfred Hitchcock's
The Phantom Fiend (1932). During the 30s, he
took his roles in plays more seriously than the films he made. In 1940,
Jessica accepted a role in America and Jack volunteered to serve in the
Royal Welch Fusiliers. He spent most of his military career arranging
entertainment for the British forces in India. One of the actresses who
came out to India was
Doreen Lawrence who became his
second wife after the war.
Alexander Korda advised Jack to
go into films and offered him a three-year contract. In his
autobiography, Jack recalled: "Eight years later I was voted the number
one box office draw of 1954. I was even credited with irresistible sex
appeal, which is another quality I had not imagined I possessed." A
late 1940s film,
The Black Rose (1950), where he
played a secondary role to Tyrone Power,
would be one of his most fortunate choices of roles. The director was
Henry Hathaway who Jack said was
"probably the most feared, yet respected director in America, for he
had a sharp tongue and fired people at the drop of a hat. Years later,
after my operation when I lost my voice, he went out of his way to help
me get back into films. What I did not know was that during the filming
of 'The Black Rose' he was himself suffering from cancer." In the 1950s
came the film that made Hawkins a star,
The Cruel Sea (1953). Suffering
from life-long, real-life seasickness, he played the captain of the
Compass Rose. After surgery for throat cancer in 1966, requiring the
removal of his larynx, Jack continued to make films. He mimed his lines
and the voice was dubbed by either
Charles Gray or
Robert Rietty. His motto during those last
years came from Milton's "Comus", a verse play in which he acted early
in his career in Regent's Park. The lines: "Yet where an equal poise of
hope and fear does arbitrate the event, my nature is that I incline to
hope, rather than to fear."23. Howard DeutchDirectorProducerAdditional CrewSome Kind of Wonderful (1987)Howard Deutch was born on 14 September 1950 in New York City, New York, USA. He is a director and producer, known for Some Kind of Wonderful (1987), Pretty in Pink (1986) and The Great Outdoors (1988). He has been married to Lea Thompson since 23 July 1989. They have two children.24. Harve PresnellActorSoundtrackFargo (1996)By the time handsome, brawny baritone Harve Presnell arrived on the
film scene, the "Golden Age" of musicals had long dissipated. Born in
Modesto, California in 1933 and spending part of his youth on a family ranch near Yosemite Valley where he labored in the fields, it was discovered he had quite a voice at such a young age (7) and he became a soloist at his local church.He graduated from Modesto High School and received a USC sports scholarship, but moved quickly to singing at Lotte Lehmann's Academy of the West. At the age of 21, he coveted the lead in the American premiere of Darius Milhaud's "David". Initially trained for an operatic career, he spent three seasons singing throughout Europe with roles in "La Forza del Destino", "Un ballo in Maschera", "The Marriage of Figaro" and "Tosca". He also shared the musical stage with Dorothy Kirsten and Leontyne Price.Harve was performing nationally, including New York's Carnegie Hall in "Carmina Burana", when the opportunity for Broadway first came his way. Legendary composer Meredith Willson happened to catch an
earful of the gifted singer in a "Gershwin Night" concert at the Hollywood Bowl in Los
Angeles and, in the virile mold of Alfred Drake and
Howard Keel, wrote the role of Johnny "Leadville" Brown in "The Unsinkable Molly Brown" specifically for him.
The Broadway musical, with Tammy Grimes as
the spunky title heroine, was a resounding hit as Harve wrapped his
glorious tonsils around such sturdy songs as "Colorado,
My Home" and "I'll Never Say No". Unlike Grimes, Presnell was granted
the opportunity to recreate his rags-to-riches part, when the celluloid version of
The Unsinkable Molly Brown (1964)
came out with a bankable film star, the indomitable Debbie Reynolds, inhabiting the
backwoods role. The film version was also hugely popular with audiences
and Harve, with his terrific presence, seemed well on his way to stardom.There were precious few movie musicals, however, for Presnell to sink
his teeth into and he quickly faded from view. He tried adjusting to
straight dramatics with the rugged western
The Glory Guys (1965) and sang
again in the highly unworthy teen frolic
When the Boys Meet the Girls (1965)
with Connie Francis, but little else came
in his direction. The disastrous film version of
Paint Your Wagon (1969), hurt by
the miscasting of leads Lee Marvin,
Clint Eastwood and
Jean Seberg, was redeemed only by the
presence of Presnell and his superb, moving rendition of "They Call the
Wind Maria".By the 70s, Harve was finished in films but gamely kept his momentum
with Keel-like stock and touring leads in such productions as
"Camelot", "The Sound of Music", "Annie Get Your Gun" and "On a Clear
Day You Can See Forever", among others. He even played Rhett Butler in
a 1972 musical version of "Gone With the Wind" at London's Drury Lane
Theatre, but the production did not generate much of a stir. In 1979,
Presnell served as a replacement in the Broadway musical "Annie" as
Daddy Warbucks and wound up staying employed as the blustery but
bighearted moneybags for nearly 4 years on tour, also reprising the
role in the failed 90s sequel, "Annie II: Miss Hannigan's Revenge"
(1989), which was later reworked and re-titled "Annie Warbucks" (1992).
All told, it is estimated that Harve played the tycoon role over
2,000 times.More than 25 years had passed by the time Presnell returned to the
movies as a brash and balding character actor. He struck pure gold as
the implacable, ill-fated father-in-law of
William H. Macy in the Coen Brothers'
cult film hit, Fargo (1996). This success,
in turn, led to meaty roles in
Larger Than Life (1996),
The Whole Wide World (1996),
The Chamber (1996),
Face/Off (1997),
Saving Private Ryan (1998)
and
The Legend of Bagger Vance (2000),
to name a few. Over the course of his career, he displayed a strong
presence on TV as well with recurring roles on prime-time (Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman (1993)) and daytime (Ryan's Hope (1975). Presnell may have been born 10-20
years too late to have become a singing film star, but he suddenly had
come back in spades to launch a whole new career as a noted character
performer. At age 70+, he was unsinkable, vigorously steamrolling on TV
(The Pretender (1996), Monk (2002) and ER (1994)) and in the films
Mr. Deeds (2002),
Old School (2003),
Flags of Our Fathers (2006)
and Evan Almighty (2007). His last
series role was in the short-lived
Andy Barker, P.I. (2007).Pancreatic cancer got the best of the actor in his final years. The
twice-married Presnell with six children (Stephanie, Taylor, Etoile,
Tulley, Shannon and Raine) succumbed to his illness at the St. John's
Health Center in Santa Monica, California on June 30, 2009, at age 75.25.
