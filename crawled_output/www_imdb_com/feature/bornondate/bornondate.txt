Christina ChongActressDirectorWriterJohnny English Reborn (2011)Christina Chong is an international television and film actress who stars in the CBS series "Star Trek: Strange New Worlds" as series regular 'La'an Noonien-Singh,' alongside Anson Mount and Rebecca Romijn. The series expanded on the iconic franchise, with six new crew members on the USS Enterprise, alongside its familiar trio of lead characters. The series returns for its second season in June and has already been picked up for a third season. Alongside acting, Christina is now following her musical passion with a debut EP titled "Twin Flames" releasing in August.For Christina, the focus on equality and diversity in the Star Trek franchise leads back to her own personal journey in Hollywood. Christina is the proud daughter of a Chinese father who immigrated to the UK from Hong Kong and English mother. Her tireless work ethic stems from watching her father working low wage jobs in restaurants, often jobs only immigrants would be willing to take on, and her mother staying at home raising six children. She credits her ability to succeed in the arts to her mother, when despite living in government housing and raising her family on welfare, always managed to support Christina's dreams.She began in the performing arts at three years old with dance and attended Italia Conti (the UK equivalent to world famous Juilliard) for high school. It was there she cultivated her musical theater and acting skills staring as 'Anita' in West Side Story in her graduation show, before moving to Germany to star in the European premier of the musical Aida, written by Elton John and Tim Rice. To further her career, she moved to New York to study at The Lee Strasberg Theatre & Film Institute. Soon after, she returned to London to pursue her acting career full time.Her career has seen no bounds to what she can achieve. On the television side she can be seen in hit series such as Netflix's "Black Mirror," BBC America's "Doctor Who," Fox's "24: Live Another Day," "Halo: Nightfall" with Mike Colter, British crime drama "Line of Duty," and ITV's "Grace."On the film side, she stars in Blockbuster hits such as Universal Pictures' "Johnny English Reborn," Warner Bros.' "Tom & Jerry: The Movie," which was nominated for 'The Family Movie of 2021' award at the People's Choice Awards, "Christmas Eve" with Cheryl Hines and Patrick Stewart, award winning independent feature "W.E." with Oscar Isaac, and "Legacy" with Idris Elba.Christina's lifelong passion to release original music has emerged in the form of her debut EP titled Twin Flames (August 2023). Comprised of four original songs: "Twin Flames," "No Blame," "Can't Show Love," and "I Get to Choose," listeners are taken on a journey of passion, pain, healing, and self-love during and after a "twin flame" relationship; from meeting to breaking-up to the understanding of what happened, and ultimately finding happiness alone. For the production, Christina worked with Jake Gosling (Ed Sheeran, Shawn Mendes, Shania Twain), NUUXS (Major Lazer, Diplo), and Matt Brettle (Cat Burns, Ardee) through record label Goldun Egg.Christina has spent the last decade and half, rediscovering who she is in Hollywood both personally and professionally, working with life coach Michael James. She hopes to share her story of dealing with rejection, personal development, and overcoming adversity with the world. Aside from being in front of the camera, she is writing and producing, drawing from personal experiences to create content that gives hope and inspires.2. James MarsdenActorSoundtrackHairspray (2007)James Paul Marsden, or better known as just James Marsden, was born on
September 18, 1973, in Stillwater, Oklahoma, to Kathleen (Scholz) and
James Luther Marsden. His father, a distinguished Professor of Animal
Sciences & Industry at Kansas State University, and his mother, a
nutritionist, divorced when he was nine years old. James grew up with
his four other siblings, sisters, Jennifer and Elizabeth, and brothers,
Jeff and Robert. He has English, German, and Scottish ancestry. During his teen years, he attended Putnam City
North High School which was located in Oklahoma City. After graduating
in 1991, he attended Oklahoma State University and studied Broadcast
Journalism. While in university, he became a member of the Delta Tau
Delta fraternity.While vacationing with his family in
Hawaii, he met actor Kirk Cameron,
and his actress sister,
Candace Cameron Bure. They
eventually invited James to visit them in Los Angeles. After studying
in Oklahoma State for over a year and appearing in his college
production, "Bye Bye Birdie", he left school and moved to Los Angeles
to pursue his interest in acting. James got his first job on the pilot
episode of The Nanny (1993) as
Eddie, who was Margaret Sheffield's boyfriend. He then became part of
the Canadian television series,
Boogies Diner (1994), which
aired for one season. After that series ended, he got a brief role as
the original Griffin on Fox's
Party of Five (1994). His first
big break came when he became the lead on the short-lived ABC series,
Second Noah (1996). Although the
show didn't last long, the young actor received enough exposure from
the public and even managed to win the hearts of fellow teenage girls.
In 1996, he attended an audition for a movie titled
Primal Fear (1996) but unfortunately
lost that role to Edward Norton.
Two years later, he was offered a lead role in
54 (1998), which he turned down. The role
later went to another actor,
Ryan Phillippe.James' star power increased when he starred in
David Nutter's
Disturbing Behavior (1998),
alongside Katie Holmes and
Nick Stahl, which had mixed reviews, but
mostly positive ones. His role in the television series as Glenn Foy in
Ally McBeal (1997), is probably
one of his biggest achievement to date. He became one of the main cast
members during the first half of season 5, where he showcased his
singing abilities. It was in that show where he was able to grab the
attention of audiences from different backgrounds. The 5' 10" star
later played Lon Hammon Jr. in the romantic movie,
The Notebook (2004), which was based
on a novel by Nicholas Sparks of the same name. His movies,
Lies and Alibis (2006) and
10th & Wolf (2006) was also released
around the world to audiences in the year 2006. One of his most
memorable roles to fans is his role as Cyclops in the
X-Men (2000) movie franchise. The movie was
well accepted by audiences and critics, which eventually made James one
of the hottest stars since it was released. He was among the actors who
starred in all three of the X-Men movies. James had the honor of
working alongside
Patrick Stewart,
Famke Janssen and
Hugh Jackman in the film. However, not many
people know that he actually had to wear lifts for most of his scenes
in the X-men movies, because his character Cyclops is supposed to be 6"
3" compared to a 5' 3" Wolverine. In reality, he is actually under 6'
0", shorter than Famke Janssen who plays his love interest, Jean Grey,
and even shorter than Hugh Jackman who played Wolverine.In the year
2006, he played Richard White in the
highly anticipated movie,
Superman Returns (2006), which
coincidentally was directed by
Bryan Singer, who also directed
previous X-Men installments. Although he appeared in
X-Men: The Last Stand (2006),
the third installment of the X-Men franchise, many would notice that he
in fact had more screen time in 'Superman Returns', as Lois Lane's long
awaiting fiancé who had to accept the fact that his fiancée is in love
with the man of steel. James earned great reviews from that movie,
which led to him getting more movie roles. In 2007, James played Corny
Collins in the film Hairspray (2007),
an adaption of the Broadway musical based on
John Waters movie,
Hairspray (1988). He joined a
star-studded cast, starring alongside top names such as
John Travolta,
Queen Latifah and
Michelle Pfeiffer. James not only
acted in that movie, but also sang two of the film's songs, "The Nicest
Kids In Town", and "Hairspray". Being part of Hairspray catapulted
James to a different level of stardom as audiences got to see another
side of him. His next role was in the Disney movie,
Enchanted (2007), playing Prince
Edward, where he acted alongside
Amy Adams,
Susan Sarandon and
Patrick Dempsey. Once again,
James had the opportunity to sing in two songs from the movie, "True
Love's Kiss" and "That's Amore".
Enchanted (2007) appealed to not only
older audiences but also to those who were fans of Disney's network
productions. Following his huge success in the years 2006 and 2007,
James played the male lead role in the romantic comedy,
27 Dresses (2008), opposite actress
Katherine Heigl in 2008. The movie did
well at the box office, earning a gross revenue of over $159
million, which exceeded the expectations of crew members especially
since it was under a $30 million budget.Marsden played the
male lead in the horror film,
The Box (2009), based on the 1970
short story "Button, Button" by author Richard Matheson. He starred opposite Cameron Diaz in the
movie.He co-starred in
Accidental Love (2015) (previously Accidental Love (2015), a politically-themed romantic comedy, directed by David O. Russell and filmed in
Columbia, South Carolina. Marsden's recent film roles include the sequel comedy Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues (2013), the romantic drama The Best of Me (2014), and the comedy Unfinished Business (2015).James was married to
Lisa Linde, an actress known from her role in
Days of Our Lives (1965).
Lisa is the daughter of legendary country music songwriter Dennis
Linde. The couple wed on July 22, 2000 and have a son, Jack Holden Marsden who
was born on February 1, 2001, and a daughter, Mary James, who was born
on August 10, 2005. They divorced in 2011. James has another son, born in 2012, with model Rose Costa.Many would assume that with
all this success achieved by James at this age, he would be somewhat
high-headed but James mentioned that despite all the attention he's
getting from the public eye, he tries to keep himself as grounded as
possible. He even admits that he flies coach instead of first class
while traveling with his family. In an interview he mentioned that he
believes he has a certain responsibility to let his children know that
he isn't special because of what he does, but who he is as a person.
With a great humble attitude and a bright future ahead of him, there's
definitely more to expect from this Oklahoma native.3.

was expelled from Louisville's DuPont Manual High School for repeatedly
fighting. Good with his fists, he turned professional, boxing as a
welterweight under the name "Johnny Costello", adopting his mother's
maiden name. The purses were poor, so he soon left the ring and worked

Yangtze River Patrol for the best part of his three-year hitch before

read a play by Clifford Odets given to
him by a fellow soldier who was an actor in civilian life. He was so
moved by the play, he decided to become an actor after the war. After
recovering from his badly shattered leg, Warden saw action at the
Battle of the Bulge, Nazi Germany's last major offensive. He was
demobilized with the rank of sergeant and decided to pursue an acting
career on the G.I. Bill. He moved to New York City to attend acting
school, then joined the company of Theatre
'47 in Dallas in 1947 as
a professional actor, taking his middle name as his surname.
This repertory company, run by
Margo Jones,
became famous in the 1940s and '50s for producing Tennessee Williams's
plays. The experience gave him a valuable grounding in both classic and
contemporary drama, and he shuttled between Texas and New York for five
years as he was in demand as an actor. Warden made his television debut
in 1948, though he continued to perform on stage (he appeared in a
stage production in
Arthur Miller's
Death of a Salesman (1966)).
After several years in small, local productions, he made both his
Broadway debut in the 1952 Broadway revival of Odets' "Golden Boy" and,
three years later, originated the role of "Marco" in the original
Broadway production of Miller's "A View From the Bridge". On film, he
and fellow World War II veteran,
Lee Marvin (Marine Corps, South
Pacific), made their debut in
You're in the Navy Now (1951)
(a.k.a. "U.S.S. Teakettle"), uncredited, along with fellow vet
Charles Bronson, then billed as
"Charles Buchinsky".With his athletic physique, he was routinely cast in bit parts as
soldiers (including the sympathetic barracks-mate of
Montgomery Clift and
Frank Sinatra in the Oscar-winning
From Here to Eternity (1953).
He played the coach on TV's
Mister Peepers (1952) with
Wally Cox.Aside from
From Here to Eternity (1953)
(The Best Picture Oscar winner for 1953), other famous roles in the
1950s included Juror #7 (a disinterested salesman who wants a quick
conviction to get the trial over with) in
12 Angry Men (1957) - a film that
proved to be his career breakthrough - the bigoted foreman in
Edge of the City (1957) and one
of the submariners commended by
Clark Gable and
Burt Lancaster in the World War II drama,
Run Silent Run Deep (1958).
In 1959, Warden capped off the decade with a memorable appearance in
The Twilight Zone (1959)
episode,
The Lonely (1959),
in the series premier year of 1959. As "James Corry", Warden created a
sensitive portrayal of a convicted felon marooned on an asteroid,
sentenced to serve a lifetime sentence, who falls in love with a robot.
It was a character quite different from his role as Juror #7.In the 1960s and early 70s, his most memorable work was on television,
playing a detective in
The Asphalt Jungle (1961),
The Wackiest Ship in the Army (1965)
and N.Y.P.D. (1967). He opened up
the decade of the 1970s by winning an Emmy Award playing football coach
"George Halas" in
Brian's Song (1971), the
highly-rated and acclaimed TV movie based on
Gale Sayers's memoir, "I Am Third". He
appeared again as a detective in the TV series,
Jigsaw John (1976), in the
mid-1970s,
The Bad News Bears (1979)
and appeared in a pilot for a planned revival of
Topper (1937) in 1979.His collaboration with
Warren Beatty in two 1970s films
brought him to the summit of his career as he displayed a flair for
comedy in both Shampoo (1975) and
Heaven Can Wait (1978). As the
faintly sinister businessman "Lester" and as the perpetually befuddled
football trainer "Max Corkle", Warden received Academy Award
nominations as Best Supporting Actor. Other memorable roles in the
period were as the metro news editor of the "Washington Post" in
All the President's Men (1976),
the German doctor in
Death on the Nile (1978), the
senile, gun-toting judge in
And Justice for All (1979),
the President of the United States in
Being There (1979), the twin car
salesmen in Used Cars (1980) and
Paul Newman's law partner in
The Verdict (1982).This was the peak of Warden's career, as he entered his early sixties.
He single-handedly made
Andrew Bergman's
So Fine (1981) watchable, but after that
film, the quality of his roles declined. He made a third stab at TV,
again appearing as a detective in
Crazy Like a Fox (1984) in
the mid-1980s. He played the shifty convenience store owner "Big Ben"
in Problem Child (1990) and its two
sequels, a role unworthy of his talent, but he shone again as the
Broadway high-roller "Julian Marx" in
Woody Allen's
Bullets Over Broadway (1994).
After appearing in Warren Beatty's
Bulworth (1998), Warden's last film was
The Replacements (2000) in 2000.
He then lived in retirement in New York City with his girlfriend,
Marucha Hinds. He was married to French stage actress
Wanda Ottoni, best known for her role as
the object of Joe Besser's desire in
The Three Stooges short,
Fifi Blows Her Top (1958). She
gave up her career after her marriage. They had one son, Christopher,
but had been separated for many years.15. Tim McInnernyActorSoundtrackNotting Hill (1999)Tim McInnerny is an English actor. He is known for his many roles on stage and television, including as Lord Percy Percy and Captain Darling in the 1980s British sitcom Blackadder. McInnerny was born on 18 September 1956 in Cheadle Hulme, Cheshire, the son of Mary Joan (née Gibbings) and William Ronald McInnerny. He was brought up in Cheadle Hulme, and Stroud, Gloucestershire, and educated at Marling School, a grammar school in Stroud, and read English at Wadham College, Oxford, matriculating in 1976 after taking a gap year backpacking around the world.16. Tara FitzgeraldActressDirectorMusic DepartmentExodus: Gods and Kings (2014)Tara Fitzgerald was born in Sussex, England. Her
mother, Sarah Fitzgerald, is Irish, and her father, Michael Callaby, was Italian. Shortly after her birth, her family moved to Freeport, in the
Bahamas where her grandfather, David Fitzgerald, was a well-established
lawyer. Her sister, Arabella Fitzgerald, was born there, but the family
returned to London when Tara was three. Her mother and father separated
when she was four-years-old and, along with her mother and sister, Tara
moved in with her uncle and Aunt Caroline. Her mother married the Irish actor
Norman Rodway when Tara was age 6, and the
birth of her half-sister, Bianca Rodway,
followed shortly thereafter. Rodway and Sarah Fitzgerald separated when
Tara was seven.Tara's formative years were spent moving around - a lifestyle that saw
her attending five primary schools while living in a variety of
locations which included Glasgow, Dublin, and Stratford-upon-Avon.
Eventually, Sarah and her three daughters returned to South London, but
she left at the age of 16 after passing her "O" level examinations, now
known as the GCSE (General Certificate of Secondary Education) exams.
Her reason for taking a break from the educational process was that she
was not allowed to pursue her goal of attending drama school. Tara had
auditioned for RADA and the Guildhall, but she was unable to secure a
placement. She now recognizes that, at age 17, she really had not been
ready.Tara spent the next two years working her way around Europe as a
waitress, an experience that provided her with an improved perspective.
When she returned to London and decided to audition for a place at the
Drama Centre, she was accepted immediately. Her training at the Drama
Centre leaned heavily toward method acting which she recalls was like
one long therapy session of breaking down the ego, and then rebuilding
it. (Other well-known actors who trained at the Drama Centre include
Anthony Hopkins,
Colin Firth,
Simon Callow and
Pierce Brosnan).Life at the Drama Centre consisted of long days and hard work, but Tara
recalls the time as being one of the best in her life. She was living
at home with her mother, and working as a waitress at "The Ark"
restaurant in Kensington to repay the bank loan which she had secured
to cover her tuition fees. A theatrical agent noticed her performance
in an amateur production, and arranged for Tara to audition for a
co-starring role in the offbeat comedy
Hear My Song (1991). Tara was the
first actress to audition and, after the director had seen another 300
young hopefuls, the role was hers. Two weeks after graduating from
college in July, 1990, Tara was at work on a major film that turned out
to be a surprise success, and generated rave reviews of her
performance. Tara never looked back.Starring roles in several successful television productions during 1991
and 1992 followed. Tara received critical acclaim for
The Black Candle (1991),
Six Characters in Search of an Author (1992),
The Camomile Lawn (1992)
and
Anglo Saxon Attitudes (1992).
Her next major step was a co-starring role in the West End play, "Our
Song", where she acquitted herself nightly opposite one of the legends
of the London stage,
Peter O'Toole. This success was
followed by a role opposite
Hugh Grant in the Australian hit
film, Sirens (1994), for which the
Australian Film Institute nominated Tara as Best Actress in a Lead
Role.An American mini-series,
Fall from Grace (1994),
was followed by the Irish film,
A Man of No Importance (1994),
which found Tara sharing honors with
Albert Finney. Then came the two widely
different television productions
Mystery!: Cadfael (1994) (The Leper of St.
Giles
(#1.3)) and The Vacillations of Poppy Carew (1995).Tara was back co-starring with
Hugh Grant in
The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain (1995)
before she embarked upon another major change of pace by playing
"Ophelia" opposite Ralph Fiennes in
"Hamlet" on the London and Broadway stages. Ralph received the
notoriety, but Tara received the award for Best Supporting Actress from
the New York Critics Circle.Tara's next success was co-starring with
Ewan McGregor in the highly acclaimed
comedy/drama Brassed Off (1996).
Then, it was back to BBC television for
The Tenant of Wildfell Hall (1996),
The Woman in White (1997)
and
The Prince of Hearts (1997),
all of which were featured on the U.S. mainstay, "Masterpiece Theatre".
Tara's next theatrical film was
Conquest (1998), which was produced in
Canada. Back on the British side of the Atlantic, Tara starred in the
contemporary
Little White Lies (1998)
and the Daphne Du Maurier swashbuckler
(also featured on Masterpiece Theatre)
Frenchman's Creek (1998),
for which she received the award for Best Actress at the 1999 Reims
International Television Festival.A major part in the film
Childhood (2001) (which,
regrettably, has never been released) was followed by the harrowing
role of a stalked woman in the psychological drama
In the Name of Love (1999).
Radio dramatizations have included "A Handful of Dust", "Look Back in
Anger", "The African Queen" and, most recently, "Laughter in
Leningrad".Tara has been heard as the voice of the narrator in such diverse
television mini-series as Wild Thing (Animal Life), The Final Day
(Celebrity Deaths), Vice - Inside Britain's Sex Business
(Self-explanatory), Reputations (Biographies), Omnibus: A Long Time
Ago, The Story of Star Wars (TV Special) and, most recently, The
Changemakers.You also will hear Tara's great voice doing radio and television
advertisements for products ranging from Johnson's Facial Wipes to
Norwich Union Insurance.Tara's recent cinematic appearances have included co-starring with
Rutger Hauer in
New World Disorder (1999), and
starring opposite Rhys Ifans and
Joseph Fiennes in
Rancid Aluminum (2000).During this period, Tara appeared on stage in the title role of
"Antigone", and as "Blanche du Bois" in "A Streetcar Named Desire".In 2001, Tara appeared as the female lead in the World War II drama,
Dark Blue World (2001) (aka "Dark
Blue World"), a Czech film by Academy Award-winning director
Jan Sverák
(Kolya (1996)). She was also seen on the big screen in
I Capture the Castle (2003),
a romantic comedy based upon the 1948 novel by
Dodie Smith (101 Dalmatians).Tara's recent television work has included a starring role in a segment
of the highly-regarded psychological drama series
Murder in Mind (2001),
Echoes (2003).
She also played the leading female role in
Love Again (2003), a
dramatization of the life of British poet
Philip Larkin, which was telecast on the
BBC in July.Tara has completed work on
Secret Passage (2004) opposite
John Turturro, a period drama which is set
in Venice during the Spanish Inquisition, and
Five Children and It (2004),
a family adventure film based on E. Nesbit's
classic 1902 novel, which was released in the U.K. on October 22, 2004.
During the late winter and early spring of 2004, Tara completed a very
successful tour of the United Kingdom playing the role of "Nora Helmer"
in "A Doll's House", for which she received high critical acclaim. In
the fall of 2004, she began a tour in the role of "Mara Hill" in a new
comedy "Clouds", by Michael Frayn.During her career, Tara has picked her roles cautiously, always seeking
to play the role of a strong woman. She feels that playing characters
who have weak and insipid parts do not provide her with the motivation
that the role of a strong woman can deliver. She has been remarkably
successful in a variety of genre ranging from historical costume dramas
(The Woman in White (1997),
The Tenant of Wildfell Hall (1996)
and
Frenchman's Creek (1998)),
to contemporary psychological suspense dramas
(Little White Lies (1998)
and
In the Name of Love (1999)),
as well as comedy dramas
(Brassed Off (1996) and
Conquest (1998)), and offbeat comedies
(Sirens (1994) and
The Vacillations of Poppy Carew (1995)).
Her fine performance in the World War II drama
Dark Blue World (2001) (aka "Dark
Blue World") and her recent work on stage give further evidence of her
acting versatility.17.

Robert BlakeActorWriterProducerLost Highway (1997)American actor who began as a child in Our Gang comedies and reappeared
as a powerful adult performer of leading and character roles. Born in
New Jersey, the young Mickey Gubitosi won a role in MGM's Our Gang
series at the age of 5. As one of the more prominent children in the
Gang, he gained attention for his cute good looks and his lovable, if
somewhat melancholy, personality.In 1940 he took on the stage name Bobby Blake (though he continued to
use the name Mickey Gubitosi in the Our Gang series for another three
years) and began playing child roles in a wide range of films. He
gained a good deal of fame as the Indian sidekick Little Beaver in the
Red Ryder series of Westerns. Though roles were sporadic as he grew to
manhood, he was never long off the screen (except for a period of
military service, 1954-56). But despite some fine work in films like
Pork Chop Hill (1959) and
Town Without Pity (1961), his
career did not take off until his stunning portrayal of killer Perry
Smith in In Cold Blood (1967). A
number of telling performances in films of the next decade, stardom in
a popular television series
(Baretta (1975), and several ruefully
comic appearances as a guest on
The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (1962)
made him a popular figure even as his personal difficulties increased.Consumed with anger over his treatment by his family and the studio as
a child, he denigrated his early work, suffered bouts of difficulty
with drugs, and became known as a difficult, perfectionist person to
work with. He quit his successful TV series
Hell Town (1985) when his personal
demons became overwhelming. After a self-imposed exile of nearly eight
years, during which he struggled to right his life, he successfully
returned to films and television work, appearing renewed and more
confident in himself and his work.In 2001, though, the murder of his wife, Bonnie Bakley, thrust Blake
into the limelight in a different way. Admittedly having married Bakley
through the coercion of her pregnancy, a routine Bakley had apparently
tried with various other celebrities, Blake made no denial of his
distaste for the woman, but was by all accounts thrilled with the
daughter born to them. Blake was arrested for his wife's murder, but
the presumption of innocence trumped when jurors didn't believe what they thought was flimsy
evidence, and Blake was acquitted in a trial that made worldwide
headlines. Reportedly broke from legal costs, Blake indicated
hopefulness that he might be allowed to return to acting work, though a number of self destructive psychological issues, as well as an increasingly strained relationship with his daughter proved unable to save his career. Although Blake did clean up his habits, he retired from acting after starring in the David Lynch film Lost Highway, released in 1997, and was nevertheless weakened by health issues which contributed to his death in 2023.50 moreRecently viewedYou have no recently viewed pages
