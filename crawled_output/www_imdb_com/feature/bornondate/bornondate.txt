Tom HardyActorProducerWriterInception (2010)With his breakthrough performance as Eames in Christopher Nolan's sci-fi thriller Inception (2010), English actor Tom Hardy has been brought to the attention of mainstream audiences worldwide. However, the versatile actor has been steadily working on both stage and screen since his television debut in the miniseries Band of Brothers (2001). After being cast in the World War II drama, Hardy left his studies at the prestigious Drama Centre in London and was subsequently cast as Twombly in Ridley Scott's Black Hawk Down (2001) and as the villain Shinzon in Star Trek: Nemesis (2002).Edward Thomas Hardy was born on September 15, 1977 in Hammersmith, London; his mother, Elizabeth Anne (Barrett), is an artist and painter, and his father, Chips Hardy, is a writer. He is of English and Irish descent. Hardy was brought up in East Sheen, London, and first studied at Reed's School. His education continued at Tower House School, then at Richmond Drama School, and subsequently at the Drama Centre London, along with fellow Oscar nominee Michael Fassbender. After winning a modeling competition at age 21, he had a brief contract with the agency Models One.Tom spent his teens and early twenties battling delinquency, alcoholism and drug addiction; after completing his work on Star Trek: Nemesis (2002), he sought treatment and has also admitted that his battles with addiction ended his five-year marriage to Sarah Ward. Returning to work in 2003, Hardy was awarded the Evening Standard Most Promising Newcomer Award for his theatre performances in the productions of "In Arabia, We'd All Be Kings" and "Blood". In 2003, Tom also co-starred in the play "The Modernists" with Paul Popplewell, Jesse Spencer and Orlando Wells.During the next five years, Hardy worked consistently in film, television and theatre, playing roles as varied as Robert Dudley in the BBC's The Virgin Queen (2005), Bill Sikes in Oliver Twist (2007) and starring in "The Man of Mode" at the National Theatre. On the silver screen, he appeared in the crime thriller Layer Cake (2004) with Daniel Craig, Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette (2006), and the romp Scenes of a Sexual Nature (2006).In 2006, Hardy created "Shotgun", an underground theatre company along with director Robert Delamere, and directed a play, penned by his father for the company, called "Blue on Blue". In 2007, Hardy received a best actor BAFTA nomination for his touching performance as Stuart Shorter in the BBC adaptation of Alexander Masters' bestselling biography Stuart: A Life Backwards (2007). Hailed for his transformative character acting, Hardy was lauded for his emotionally and physically convincing portrayal in the ill-fated and warmhearted tale of Shorter, a homeless and occasionally violent man suffering from addiction and muscular dystrophy.The following year, he appeared as gay hoodlum Handsome Bob in the Guy Ritchie film RocknRolla (2008), but this would be his next transformation that would prove his extensive range and stun critics. In the film Bronson (2008), Hardy played the notorious Charles Bronson (given name, Michael Peterson), the "most violent prisoner in Britain". Bald, pumped-up, and outfitted with Bronson's signature strongman mustache, Hardy is unrecognizable and gives a harrowing performance that is physically fearless and psychologically unsettling. Director Nicolas Winding Refn breaks the fourth wall with Hardy retelling his tales directly to viewers as well as performing them outright before an audience of his own imagining. The performance mixes terrifying brutality, vaudevillian showmanship, wry humor, and an alarming amount of commitment, and won Hardy a British Independent Film Award for Best Actor. The performance got Hollywood's attention, and in 2009, Hardy was named one of Variety's "10 Actors to Watch". That year, he continued to garner praise for his starring role in The Take (2009), a four-part adaptation of Martina Cole's bestselling crime novel, as well as for his performance as Heathcliff in a version of Wuthering Heights (2009).Recent work includes the aforementioned breakthrough appearance in Inception (2010) alongside Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, Ken Watanabe, Michael Caine, Marion Cotillard and Elliot Page. The movie was released in July 2010 and became one of top 25 highest grossing films of all time, collecting eight Oscar nominations (including Best Picture) and winning four.Other films include Warrior (2011), opposite Joel Edgerton, the story of two estranged brothers facing the fight of a lifetime from director Gavin O'Connor, and This Means War (2012), directed by McG and co-starring Reese Witherspoon and Chris Pine. Tom also starred in the heralded Cold War thriller, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (2011) with Colin Firth and Gary Oldman. Hardy rejoined Christopher Nolan for The Dark Knight Rises (2012); he played the villain role of Bane opposite Christian Bale, Anne Hathaway, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Gary Oldman. Hardy's menacing physique and his character's scrambled, hard-to-distinguish voice became a major discussion point as the film was released.Outside of performing, Hardy is the patron for the charity "Flack", which is an organization to aid the recovery of the homeless in Cambridge. And in 2010, Hardy was named an Ambassador for The Prince's Trust, which helps disadvantaged youth. On the recent stage, he starred in the Brett C. Leonard play "The Long Red Road" in early 2010. Written for Hardy and directed by Philip Seymour Hoffman, the play was staged at Chicago's Goodman Theater.In 2015, Hardy starred as the iconic Mad Max in George Miller's reboot of his franchise, Mad Max: Fury Road (2015). He also collected a British Independent Film Award for his portrayal of both the Kray twins, Ronnie and Reggie, in Legend (2015), and an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his role as John Fitzgerald in The Revenant (2015). Hardy also starred on the BBC series Peaky Blinders (2013), alongside Cillian Murphy, and on the television series Taboo (2017), both created by Steven Knight.He has an outlaw biker story among other projects in development. In 2010, Hardy became engaged to fellow English actress Charlotte Riley, whom he starred with in The Take (2009) and Wuthering Heights (2009), and is raising a young son, Louis Thomas Hardy, with ex-girlfriend Rachael Speed. He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire at the 2018 Queen's Birthday Honours for his services to drama.2. Tommy Lee JonesActorDirectorWriterThe Homesman (2014)Tommy Lee Jones was born in San Saba, Texas, the son of Lucille Marie
(Scott), a police officer and beauty shop owner, and Clyde C. Jones,
who worked on oil fields. Tommy himself worked in underwater
construction and on an oil rig. He attended St. Mark's School of Texas,
a prestigious prep school for boys in Dallas, on a scholarship, and
went to Harvard on another scholarship. He roomed with future Vice
President Al Gore and played offensive
guard in the famous 29-29 Harvard-Yale football game of '68 known as
"The Tie." He received a B.A. in English literature and graduated cum
laude from Harvard in 1969.Following college, he moved to New York and began his theatrical career
on Broadway in "A Patriot for Me" (1969). In 1970, he made his film
debut in Love Story (1970). While
living in New York, he continued to appear in various plays, both on-
and off-Broadway: "Fortune and Men's Eyes" (1969); "Four on a Garden"
(1971); "Blue Boys" (1972); "Ulysses in Nighttown" (1974). During this
time, he also appeared on a daytime soap opera,
One Life to Live (1968) as
Dr. Mark Toland from 1971-75. He moved with wife
Kate Lardner, granddaughter of short-story
writer/columnist Ring Lardner, and
her two children from a previous marriage, to Los Angeles.There he began to get some roles on television:
Charlie's Angels (1976)
(pilot episode);
Smash-Up on Interstate 5 (1976);
and
The Amazing Howard Hughes (1977).
While working on the movie
Back Roads (1981), he met and fell in
love with Kimberlea Cloughley, whom he later married. More roles in
television--both on network and cable--stage and film garnered him a
reputation as a strong, explosive, thoughtful actor who could handle
supporting as well as leading roles. He made his directorial debut in
The Good Old Boys (1995)
on TNT. In addition to directing and starring in the film, he co-wrote
the teleplay (with J.T. Allen). The
film, based on Elmer Kelton's novel, is set
in west Texas where Jones has strong family ties. Consequently, this
story of a cowboy facing the end of an era has special meaning for him.3. Lee Chae-MinActorAlchemy of Souls (2022– )Lee Chae-Min was born on 15 September 2000 in South Korea. He is an actor, known for Alchemy of Souls (2022), See You in My 19th Life (2023) and Hierarchy (2024).4. Dave AnnableActorSoundtrackYellowstone (2018–2022)David Rodman Annable was born on September 15, 1979, in Suffern, New
York, to Tammi and Rodman John Annable. He has one sister named Rebecca and a half-sister named Stacy. His mother is Jewish and his father has English, German, Irish
and French ancestry. Dave grew up in Walden, a small town in upstate
New York.Growing up, he enjoyed playing baseball, rugby and hockey. Dave even
played for the local Plattsburgh team. He is also a big fan of the New
York Giants, New York Mets and the New Jersey Devils. While he was
still in New York, he attended SUNY Plattsburgh. Dave participated in
the student-run Plattsburgh State Television, both acting and behind
the camera. Among the shows that he hosted were "Late Night with Dave
Annable", "Cardinal Sports", "Stay Tuned", "Cardinal Hockey", "On
Campus Live" and "The Roommate Game".Dave had a semester of college left and often commuted for commercial
auditions, which took 8 hours from Plattsburgh by bus. Dave then
decided to tell his parents that he considered dropping out of college
to become a full-time actor. Although his parents did not approve of
his decision at that time because college was very important in their
family, they still gave Dave the support he needed.He eventually attended the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre
in New York City, generally associated with the Meisner technique of
Sanford Meisner. There, he studied
acting with Richárd Pintér. The 5'9" star
appeared in a number of commercials which included "Reebok",
'Wendy's", "Starbust" and "Pepsi". He was also a featured actor in a "Mountain Dew" commercial with former NASCAR Rookie of the year, Kasey Kahne.Dave first gained attention from the public when he played the role of
"Aaron Lewis" on the short-lived television series,
Reunion (2005), which aired on Fox in
2005. "Reunion" was a teen drama/murder mystery series which explored
occurrences in the lives of twenty former high school friends from 1986
through 2005, and recounted events leading up to the murder of one of
the major characters. Before starring in "Reunion", Dave already had
guest roles on
Third Watch (1999),
Other People's Business (2003)
and Spellbound (2002) as well as
Little Black Book (2004).He received his breakout role in 2006, when he was offered a regular
starring role on the ABC family drama,
Brothers & Sisters (2006).
The show was about the trials and travails of the Walker family, with
every family secret unveiled. He was among the first actors cast on the
show before they began signing bigger names such as
Calista Flockhart,
Sally Field and
Rob Lowe.Dave played the role of "Justin Walker", a psychologically damaged
Afghan war veteran suffering with drug problems. In fact, Dave
mentioned in an interview that he had to lose 11 kg. to play the role
because they needed someone skinny to portray his character's addiction
problem. Dave also won a Prism Award for Best Performance in a Drama
Series Multi-Episode Storyline for his role in
Brothers & Sisters (2006).In a recent interview, Dave mentioned that he has actually promised his
mother that he would graduate after watching his younger sister
graduate from Cornell University. Dave is taking online classes in
Communications and will be graduating in May 2009. He also mentioned
that he will be giving the commencement speech on his graduation day.Despite all of his accomplishments in the showbiz industry, Dave is in
fact still very humble. He enjoys spending time with his family and
making people laugh.5. Oliver StoneDirectorProducerWriterPlatoon (1986)Oliver Stone has become known as a master of controversial subjects and
a legendary film maker. His films are filled with a variety of film
angles and styles, he pushes his actors to give Oscar-worthy
performances, and despite his failures, has always returned to success.William Oliver Stone was born in New York City, to Jacqueline (Goddet)
and Louis Stone, a stockbroker. His American father was from a Jewish
family (from Germany and Eastern Europe), and his mother, a war bride,
was French (and Catholic). After dropping out of Yale University, he
became a soldier in the Vietnam War. Serving in two different regiments
(including 1rst Cavalry), he was introduced to
The Doors, drugs,
Jefferson Airplane, and other things
that defined the sixties. For his actions in the war, he was awarded a
Bronze Star for Gallantry and a Purple Heart. Returning from the war,
Stone did not return to graduate from Yale. His first film was a
student film entitled
Last Year in Viet Nam (1971),
followed by the gritty horror film
Seizure (1974) for which he also wrote
the screenplay. The next seven years saw him direct two films:
Mad Man of Martinique (1979)
and The Hand (1981), starring
Michael Caine. He also wrote many
screenplays for films such as
Midnight Express (1978),
Conan the Barbarian (1982),
and Scarface (1983). Stone won his first
Oscar for
Midnight Express (1978), but his
fame was just beginning to show.1986 was the year that brought him much fame to the U.S.A. and the
world. He directed the political film
Salvador (1986) starring Oscar-nominated
James Woods. However, his big hit
was the Vietnam war film Platoon (1986)
starring
Charlie Sheen,Willem Dafoe,
Tom Berenger, and
Francesco Quinn. Berenger and Dafoe
received Oscar nominations for their roles as the polar opposite
sergeants who each influence the tour of duty of Chris Taylor (Sheen).
Stone won his first Oscar for directing this film, which won Best
Picture and was a hit at the box office. After
Platoon (1986), Stone followed up with
the critically acclaimed
Wall Street (1987). The movie,
starring Charlie Sheen and
Michael Douglas, focuses on the
business world of tycoons and stock brokers. The film was well received
and won an Oscar for Douglas' portrayal of the villainous Gordon Gekko.
Stone returned immediately the following year with
Talk Radio (1988), which talked of a
foul-mouthed radio host (played by
Eric Bogosian) who never fails to talk
about the serious issues. Although it was not as successful as his last
three films, Stone did not slow down at all. He directed
Tom Cruise into an Oscar-nominated role in
Born on the Fourth of July (1989).The movie talked about the return of an embittered, crippled Vietnam
soldier from the war. Although it failed to win Best Picture or Best
Actor, Oliver Stone won an Academy Award for Directing, his third win
to date. After
Born on the Fourth of July (1989),
Stone took a hand in producing several movies, including the Academy
Award-winning film
Reversal of Fortune (1990).
He returned to the director's chair in 1991, once again with two films.
Val Kilmer starred as the legendary and
controversial Jim Morrison in
Stone's psychedelic film
The Doors (1991).Despised by former Doors member
Ray Manzarek, the film is nevertheless a
wonderful achievement, with Kilmer pulling off an almost flawless
impersonation of Morrison. Regardless of opinion,
The Doors (1991) was overshadowed by
Stone's colossal film JFK (1991), which Stone
himself considers the best of his films. In Stone's movie,
Jim Garrison tackles the conspiracy
behind the murder of America's president
John F. Kennedy. The large cast featured
such well-known names as Kevin Costner,
Tommy Lee Jones,
John Candy, Joe Pesci,
Donald Sutherland, and
Walter Matthau. This film represented a
change in Stone's works, because it was with this film that he really
began to explore the different camera styles and combining them
together to create a multi-dimensional way of showing a movie.
JFK (1991), as with
Platoon (1986) and
Born on the Fourth of July (1989),
earned eight Oscar nominations and was one of Stone's most successful
films. However, he failed to win a third Oscar for Best Director.After this film, Stone directed his third Vietnam film to date.
Heaven & Earth (1993) was a film
about the war from the viewpoint of a Vietnamese girl, and also
co-starred Tommy Lee Jones (who had
received an Oscar nomination for JFK (1991)).
Despite its new woman's perspective and several positive reviews, it
was a box office failure. Stone was unfazed; his next film is perhaps
his most notorious film to date. Adapting a screenplay by
Quentin Tarantino, Stone made
Natural Born Killers (1994)
starring Woody Harrelson,
Juliette Lewis,
Tom Sizemore and
Rodney Dangerfield in his only
dramatic performance. The film was received well at the box office,
while review were very mixed. Because of the violence that people
claimed was inspired by the film, it was compared to
Stanley Kubrick's
A Clockwork Orange (1971). As
usual, Stone was at the center of controversial subjects; his next film
Nixon (1995) was no exception. The film
focused on the life of President Richard Nixon, played by
Anthony Hopkins, while featuring
another well-known cast, including
Joan Allen in the role of Nixon's
wife. Both went on to receive Oscar nominations, while Stone received
his sixth Oscar nomination for Screenwriting. The film got mixed
reviews, and failed to recoup its budget.Aside from directing, Stone has worked as a producer on several
different films. There was, of course, the successful film
Reversal of Fortune (1990),
which won Jeremy Irons an Oscar and also
nominated the director for an Oscar. There was also the highly praised
and successful emotional drama
The Joy Luck Club (1993) which
centered around four Chinese immigrant women whose relationships with
their daughters is affected by their own lives. Another highly praised
Oscar nominated film was Milos Forman's
classic film
The People vs. Larry Flynt (1996)
starring Woody Harrelson,
Edward Norton, and
Courtney Love. Whether the crime/action
film The Corruptor (1999) or the
brilliant war epic Savior (1998), Stone
has worked in a variety of film genres.Stone had directed ten films in nine years; now however, he began to
slow down. He directed the film
U Turn (1997) starring
Sean Penn and
Jennifer Lopez. As with
Natural Born Killers (1994),
it was a dark and twisted satire on violence, but did not have the same
success as the former. Stone was set to direct several projects in the
late
90's but they fell through
and were not made. However, success came back to Stone in the
Al Pacino
film Any Given Sunday (1999).
This sports movie centered on the life behind the game of football, and
it starred an impressive cast that included frequent Stone
collaborators James Woods and
John C. McGinley. This film was one of
his most successful box office films, and put him back on track.The following years brought Stone no new theatrical films, though he
did make three fascinating TV documentaries. Two of them, 'Looking for
Fidel' and Comandante (2003) were
interviews of Cuban dictator Fidel Castro, while 'Persona Non Grata'
was an interview of several Palestinian leaders. Stone was also set to
direct American Psycho (2000)
with Leonardo DiCaprio and
Beyond Borders (2003), starring
Angelina Jolie and at the time,
Ralph Fiennes. However, Stone dropped out
of both projects, as did a number of the actors mentioned. Finally,
five years after
Any Given Sunday (1999), Stone
directed a film he'd long wanted to make; the colossal epic
Alexander (2004). Starring
Colin Farrell as the Macedonian
leader, Stone attempted to capture the essence of Alexander the Great
through his conquests of the known world. The film focused on
Alexander's relationships with his parents (a brilliant performance by
Val Kilmer and a less impressive one by
Angelina Jolie) and his relationships
with his wife and childhood friend/ gay lover (played by
Rosario Dawson and
Jared Leto respectively).Alexander (2004) was a critical
failure, and failed to win back its budget domestically. Despite being
one of 2004's highest grossing films internationally, and recouping its
budget through DVD sales, Stone's pet project was heavily criticized.
Despite a far superior version (Alexander Revisited) being released on
DVD, the film's reputation remains low by the majority. Stone was
personally stung at these attacks, but managed to rebound, if mildly,
with his hopeful film
World Trade Center (2006). The
film centers on two firefighters trapped in the rubble of the twin
towers. It received good reviews, and allowed Oliver to step forward
from his failure towards the possibility of more films.In late 2007, besides a number of projects Stone was set to direct
"Pinkville", which would have been his fourth Vietnam film to date. It
was set to star a large number of well known actors such as
Bruce Willis,
Toby Jones,
Channing Tatum,
Michael Pitt,
Woody Harrelson, and
Michael Peña. However, a week before
shooting was to begin, the Writer's Strike was started, and the finance
for the film was cut, using the strike as an excuse. After Willis
backed out of the project, it was eventually scuttled, much like
Stone's early productions of
Platoon (1986) and
Born on the Fourth of July (1989).
Stone turned to another project he had worked on with former
Wall Street (1987) collaborator
Stanley Weiser. The project was
W. (2008), a biography on president George
W. Bush. Stone initially cast
Christian Bale in the role of Bush but
the actor dropped out at the last minute.
Josh Brolin was cast, and this followed with
a large cast of well known Oscar nominated character actors such as
Richard Dreyfuss,
James Cromwell, and
Ellen Burstyn. The film was made in a
record four months, starting in June and released in October. The film
opened to mixed reviews, and though film's budget was recouped, it was
not a financial hit.Stone then made the documentary
South of the Border (2009), a
documentary which focused on bringing to light the positive aspects of
the left-wing governments in South America, particularly Hugo Chavez in
Venezuela. Stone was much less critical than usual, instead making the
documentary as a response to the harsh reputation that Chavez has in
the States. The documentary was poorly received in the States. Stone
also began work on
Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps (2010).
Starring Michael Douglas,
Shia LaBeouf,
Josh Brolin,
Carey Mulligan, and
Eli Wallach, the film focuses on the 2008
economic crisis, and the return of Gordon Gekko from prison. The film
was screened at Cannes to positive reception, and hailed as Stone's
triumphant return. After this, Stone made a film adaptation of
"Savages", a novel by Don Winslow . The movie follows two highly
successful marijuana growers
(Taylor Kitsch and
Aaron Taylor-Johnson ), whose
shared girlfriend (Blake Lively) is
kidnapped by a Mexican cartel and held for ransom. The movie also
starred Salma Hayek,
Benicio Del Toro,
John Travolta, and
Emile Hirsch. The film was a return to the
tense action and violence of Stone's earlier films, though it polarized
many audience members due to the colorful narrations of Lively's vapid
and naive character, as well as the film's ending.After completing the ambitious and well-received television project The Untold History of the United States (2012), as well as a documentary on Hugo Chavez, Stone finally returned to feature films with Snowden (2016). Based on the life of American whistle blower Edward Snowden, Stone's film depicted his awakening to the truth behind the massive surveillances conducted by the NSA, and his attempt to warn the general public of what they did not know. The film was done independently, financed by Europeans on a low budget. It was also a return to form for Stone in a way that had not been seen since "Alexander". Joseph Gordon-Levitt, delivered a very strong performance as Snowden, with the supporting cast including Shailene Woodley, Rhys Ifans, Melissa Leo, Timothy Olyphant, and Nicolas Cage. Sadly, the film received a mixed response from critics, and was a box office disappointment.Since then, Stone has returned to television for his next two projects. One is a series of interviews with Russian leader Vladimir Putin, and the other is directing a new fictional series based on the abusive Guantanamo prison. It will be his first venture into fictional television.Oliver Stone is a three-time Oscar winner, and although he has mostly
been stung by critics of his films, he remains a well-known name today
in the film industry. The films he directed have been nominated for 31
Academy Awards, including eight for acting, six for screen writing, and
three for directing. There is no denying that Stone has cemented
himself a position among the legends of Hollywood.6. Josh CharlesActorDirectorAdditional CrewDead Poets Society (1989)Joshua Aaron Charles is an American actor. He is best known for the roles of Dan Rydell on Sports Night; Will Gardner on The Good Wife, which earned him two Primetime Emmy Award nominations; and his early work as Knox Overstreet in Dead Poets Society.

Her career started when a Polaroid picture of the 13-year-old girl made
its way into the hands of a Los Angeles modeling agency. By the age of
15, Marisa began to work as a print model and as a commercial actress.
It wasn't long before demand became global, offering her opportunities
to work in Singapore, Australia, South Africa, Hong Kong and Italy.Despite her success in modeling, it was acting classes that helped
Marisa overcome her life-long shyness. After several guest appearances on Days of our Lives and The Bold and
the Beautiful, Ramirez finally got her big break in July 2000, when she
was cast in the contract role of supermodel Gia Campbell on General
Hospital. She left this role in December 2002 to star in the
short-lived ABC drama, Miracles. During her time on GH, she was
nominated for ALMA and NAACP Awards.In April 2006, she joined the cast of The Young and the Restless as
Jabot Cosmetics public relations consultant Carmen Mesta for five
months. The character of Carmen was killed off. Ramirez briefly
returned to the show in early 2007 as Carmen's cousin, Ines Vargas.
Shortly after, she moved to Colombia to film the FOX summer series
Mental, opposite Chris Vance and Annabella Sciorra.In 2011, she was a series regular on Lifetime's "Against the Wall,"

Agatha ChristieWriterLes petits meurtres d'Agatha Christie (2009–2021)Agatha was born as "Agatha Mary Clarissa Miller" in 1890 to Frederick Alvah Miller and Clara Boehmer. Agatha was of American and British descent, her father being American and her mother British. Her father was a relatively affluent stockbroker. Agatha received home education from early childhood to when she turned 12-years-old in 1902. Her parents taught her how to read, write, perform arithmetic, and play music. Her father died in 1901. Agatha was sent to a girl's school in Torquay, Devon, where she studied from 1902 to 1905. She continued her education in Paris, France from 1905 to 1910. She then returned to her surviving family in England.As a young adult, Agatha aspired to be a writer and produced a number of unpublished short stories and novels. She submitted them to various publishers and literary magazines, but they were all rejected. Several of these unpublished works were later revised into more successful ones. While still in this point of her life, Agatha sought advise from professional writer Eden Phillpotts (1862-1960). Meanwhile she was searching for a suitable husband and in 1913 accepted a marriage proposal from military officer and pilot-in-training Archibald "Archie" Christie. They married in late 1914. Her married name became "Agatha Christie" and she used it for most of her literary works, including ones created decades following the end of her first marriage.During World War I, Archie Christie was send to fight in the war and Agatha joined the Voluntary Aid Detachment, a British voluntary unit providing field nursing services. She performed unpaid work as a volunteer nurse from 1914 to 1916. Then she was promoted to "apothecaries' assistant" (dispenser), a position which earned her a small salary until the end of the war. She ended her service in September, 1918.Agatha wrote "The Mysterious Affair at Styles", her debut novel ,in 1916, but was unable to find a publisher for it until 1920. The novel introduced her famous character Hercule Poirot and his supporting characters Inspector Japp and Arthur Hastings. The novel is set in World War I and is one of the few of her works which are connected to a specific time period.Following the end of World War I and their retirement from military life, Agatha and Archie Christie moved to London and settled into civilian life. Their only child Rosalind Margaret Clarissa Christie (1919-2004) was born early in the marriage. Agatha's debut novel was first published in 1920 and turned out to be a hit. It was soon followed by the successful novels "The Secret Adversary" (1922) and "Murder on the Links" (1923) and various short stories. Agatha soon became a celebrated writer.In 1926, Archie Christie announced to Agatha that he had a mistress and that he wanted a divorce. Agatha took it hard and mysteriously disappeared for a period of 10 days. After an extensive manhunt and much publicity, she was found living under a false name in Yorkshire. She had assumed the last name of Archie's mistress and claimed to have no memory of how she ended up there. The doctors who attended to her determined that she had amnesia. Despite various theories by multiple sources, these 10 days are the most mysterious chapter in Agatha's life.Agatha and Archie divorced in 1928, though she kept the last name Christie. She gained sole custody of her daughter Rosalind. In 1930, Agatha married her second (and last) husband Max Mallowan, a professional archaeologist. They would remain married until her death in 1976.Christie often used places that she was familiar with as settings for her novels and short stories. Her various travels with Max introduced her to locations of the Middle East, and provided inspiration for a number of novels.In 1934, Agatha and Max settled in Winterbrook, Oxfordshire, which served as their main residence until their respective deaths. During World War II, she served in the pharmacy at the University College Hospital, where she gained additional training about substances used for poisoning cases. She incorporated such knowledge for realistic details in her stories.She became a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1956 and a Dame Commander of the same order in 1971. Her husband was knighted in 1968. They are among the relatively few couples where both members have been honored for their work. Agatha continued writing until 1974, though her health problems affected her writing style. Her memory was problematic for several years and she had trouble remembering the details of her own work, even while she was writing it. Recent researches on her medical condition suggest that she was suffering from Alzheimer's disease or other dementia. She died of natural causes in early 1976.19.

He made his debut at age 8 in a school play, which piqued his interest. The father moved his family (which included younger brother Dennis) back to his homeland out of prospective business concerns. While there Henry was elected president of his class at high school and attended the University of Rio Piedras as a political science and theater major. His fluency in two languages helped earn him supplementary income as an interpreter.Henry returned to the United States on scholarships received from the Little Theater of Puerto Rico and the University of Puerto Rico, and eventually received his Bachelor of Arts degree.

While appearing in the 1965 stage production of "The Wonderful Ice Cream Suit" at the Coronet Theatre in Los Angeles, the by-now television veteran was spotted by producer David Dortort. Dortort later remembered Henry (who was then going by the name Henry Delgado) and thought him perfect for his upcoming western series The High Chaparral (1967).Billed now as Henry Darrow, the actor stole women's hearts and much of the proceedings as the roguish ladies' man Manolito Montoya, who would rather make love than war. He reached his television peak in the western program, which also starred Leif Erickson, Cameron Mitchell and Linda Cristal, who played his sister. The series ran for four seasons.Following this peak, Henry went on to earn a daytime Emmy for his role on Santa Barbara (1984) after joining the cast in 1989.

In the early 1990s, Henry replaced Efrem Zimbalist Jr. as Zorro's father in yet another cable reincarnation of the series. This series was shot in Spain.Henry continued to perform on the stage with opportunities ranging from the role Iago in "Othello" to a (still-running) one-man show entitled "That Certain Cervantes", which made its premiere in 2001. A founder of "Nosotros", an organization that gears Hispanic actors toward non-stereotyped roles, Darrow was the inaugural winner of the Ricardo Montalban/Nosotros Award for his contributions to improving the image of Latinos.Millennium credits included elderly roles in the movies Runaway Jury (2003), Angels with Angles (2005), Primo (2008) and Soda Springs (2012).
