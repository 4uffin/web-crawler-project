He studied briefly at the Royal Academy of Music. He left that, however, for the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and joined Actor's Equity in 1946, his first acting work being for BBC Radio. He made nearly a dozen movies in the United Kingdom before his critically acclaimed work as Lt.

Adam WestActorDirectorAdditional CrewBatman (1966–1968)Adam West was born William West Anderson on September 19, 1928 in Walla Walla, Washington, to parents Otto West Anderson, a farmer, and his wife Audrey V. (Speer), an opera singer. At age 10, in 1938, West had a cache of comic books; and starting in 1939, Batman, who appeared in Detective Comics, made a big impression on him--the comic hero was part bat-man (a la Count Dracula) and part world's greatest detective (a la Charlie Chan and Sherlock Holmes). When his mother remarried to a Dr. Paul Flothow, she took West and his younger brother, John, to Seattle. At age 14, West attended Lakeside School, then went to Whitman College, where he got a degree in literature and psychology. During his last year of college, he married 17-year-old Billie Lou Yeager.West got a job as a disc jockey at a local radio station, then enrolled at Stanford for post-grad courses. Drafted into the army, he spent the next two years starting military television stations, first at San Luis Obispo, California, then at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey. Afterwards, West and his wife toured Europe, visiting Germany, Switzerland and Italy's Isle of Capri. When the money ran out, he joined a childhood and college buddy, Carl Hebenstreit, who was starring in the kiddie program "The Kini Popo Show" in Hawaii. West would eventually replace Carl but not the other star, Peaches the Chimp. In 1956, he got a divorce and married a beautiful girl, originally from Tahiti, named Ngatokoruaimatauaia Frisbie Dawson (he called her "Nga" for short). They had a daughter, Jonelle (born 1957), and a son, Hunter (born 1958). In 1959, West came to Hollywood. He adopted the stage name "Adam West", which fit his roles, as he was in some westerns.After seven years in Tinseltown, he achieved fame in his signature role as Bruce Wayne / Batman, on the wildly popular ABC-TV series Batman (1966) (though he has over 60 movie and over 80 television guest appearance credits, "Batman" is what the fans remember him for). The series, which lasted three seasons, made him not just nationally but internationally famous. The movie version, Batman: The Movie (1966), earned West the "Most Promising New Star" award in 1967. The downside was that the "Batman" fame was partly responsible for ruining his marriage, and he was typecast and almost unemployable for a while after the series ended (he did nothing but personal appearances for two years).In 1970, he met and then married Marcelle Tagand Lear, and picked up two stepchildren, Moya and Jill. In addition, they had two children of their own: Nina West in 1976 and Perrin in 1979. You can't keep a good actor down--West's career took off again, and he appeared in 50 projects after that: movies, television movies and sometimes doing voices on television series. West wrote his autobiography, "Back to the Batcave" (1994). One of his most prized possessions was a drawing of Batman by Bob Kane with the inscription "To my buddy, Adam, who breathed life into my pen and ink creation". Beginning in 2000, West made guest appearances on the animated series Family Guy (1999), on which he played Mayor Adam West, the lunatic mayor of Quahog, Rhode Island.On June 9, 2017, Adam West died at age 88 after a brief battle with leukemia in Los Angeles, California. On June 15, 2017, Los Angeles shone the bat-signal on City Hall, and Walla Walla shone the bat-signal on the Whitman Tower, both as a tribute to West.15.

song has been presented in a film in two different languages. Paul
Williams began his career as an actor with his portrayal of a
12-year-old prodigy in
The Loved One (1965), playing
opposite Jonathan Winters. He

the Bandit" movies, as well as the orangutan Virgil in
Battle for the Planet of the Apes (1973).In 1995, Paul received stellar reviews for his starring role as a
wheelchair-bound hostage in

knowledge that he gained through his education and his experience as a
counselor, Paul continues to touch the lives and hearts of many people
whose lives have been affected by drug abuse and/or alcoholism. He is
actively involved with the Musician's Assistance Program and is on the

he is passionate about... this is just one way in which Paul gives of
himself to others.24. Randolph MantoothActorStuntsDirectorEmergency! (1972–1979)Randolph Mantooth definitely fit the bill when he made a bankable name
for himself in the TV medical series
Emergency! (1972) as strong but
sensitive paramedic/firefighter "John Gage".Tall, dark and good-looking, Randy is of Seminole Indian heritage, born in Sacramento,
California on September 19, 1945. One of four children born to a construction engineer, his
childhood was somewhat physically unsettling in that his father's job
career had the family moving frequently from state to state. Randy
attended San Marcos High School in the Santa Barbara area of California
where he participated in school plays. He received a scholarship to the
American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York following his studies at
Santa Barbara City College.Randy was discovered in New York by a Universal talent agent after
performing the lead in the play "Philadelphia, Here I Come" and
returned to California. He slowly built up his resume with work on such
dramatic series as Adam-12 (1968),
McCloud (1970),
Alias Smith and Jones (1971)
and
Marcus Welby, M.D. (1969).
This led to TV stardom on the popular "Emergency!" series in 1972 which
ran over five seasons. As a change of pace, he tried comedy and earned
series roles on the short-lived
Operation Petticoat (1977)
and Detective School (1979),
as well as pursued the guest star route on episodics. He was also
prominently seen in the high-profile mini-series
Testimony of Two Men (1977)
and The Seekers (1979).After a career lull in the early 1980s, Randy found a new direction in
his career with daytime soaps. He played "Clay Alden" in the soap opera
Loving (1983) from 1987 through 1990,
then left for personal reasons before returning to the show in 1993,
this time in the role of "Alex Masters". The soap was later revamped
and entitled The City (1995) but it
lasted only two more years.From there he has regularly appeared on
General Hospital (1963),
One Life to Live (1968) and
As the World Turns (1956),
where he has played both good guys and villains. Millennium credits film include featured roles in the romantic comedy It Started with a Kiss (1959), the action thriller Agent Red (2000), the social drama Price to Pay (2006), the romantic thriller He Was a Quiet Man (2007), the action adventure Bold Native (2010) and, his last to date, the horror yarn Killer Holiday (2013). On TV, he has had regular roles on the daytime soap dramas As the World Turns (1956) in 2003-2005 and One Life to Live (1968) in 2007.Randy has frequently returned to his theater roots in such productions as "Footprints in
Blood", "Back to the Blankets", "Wink Dah", "The Independence of Eddie
Rose", "The Paper Crown", "The Inuit" and, most recently, "Rain Dance"
off-Broadway in 2003.Divorced from actress Rose Parra, he married actress Kristen Connors in 2002.
