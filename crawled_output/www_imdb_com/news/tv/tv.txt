The Television Academy had made a surprising choice when announcing that comedian Nate Bargatze would be taking the stage as the host, and he didn’t exactly make his mark.

At Sunday’s Emmy ceremony, the iconic talk show won for Outstanding Talk Series — a category it’s been nominated in nine times and never won. The nightly series bested reigning champion “The Daily Show” (which had won two years in a row) and “Jimmy Kimmel Live!”The latter program actually campaigned for Colbert following CBS’s controversial decision in July to cancel “The Late Show.” Citing a “challenging backdrop” for late-night TV, the powers-that-be axed the 33-year-old television staple in what they called “purely a financial decision.”However, Paramount Global (CBS’s parent company) was trying to close a deal to merge with Skydance at the time, which required approval from the FCC — a government agency controlled by the Trump administration.
