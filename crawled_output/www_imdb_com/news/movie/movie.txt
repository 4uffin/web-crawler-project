Whereas “Alien: Earth” is chock-full of slimy, savage parasites like the titular xenomorph that don’t think twice before slicing up waves of human bodies, the writer’s 2022 novel, “Anthem,” finds its dread in a cryptic, intangible threat: a sudden wave of teenage suicides.

The answer: They wanted relevant stories and leading men like Redford, who could take the mantle from earlier matinee idols, and do so with a certain knowing twinkle in his eye that showed he was in on the joke.Released in 1969, the free-spirited and forward-thinking Western “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid” may have made Redford a star, but the Sundance Film Festival made him a saint,...See full article at Variety - Film News9/16/2025by Peter DebrugeVariety - Film NewsAmy Poehler Calls Out the Oscars for Never Awarding Comedy Movies: ‘It’s Some Hot Bulls—.

Sure, "The Fantastic Four: First Steps" is an appealing utopian text, and many audiences were fond of the hokeyness of "Superman," but "The Toxic Avenger" is handily the most fun and easily the grossest. Peter Dinklage gives a surprisingly committed performance as the put-upon janitor Winston Gooze, while Luisa Guerreiro (speaking with Dinklage's voice) is even more impressive as the post-mutation Winston, a.k.a. the Toxic Avenger. Blair's film takes place in a dystopian world of foul steam, mutagenic chemicals, and toxic greed. Evil pharmaceutical companies are happy to poison the populace,...See full article at Slash Film9/16/2025by Witney SeiboldSlash FilmDanny DeVito Played A Wild Prank On His It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia Crew"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia" star Danny DeVito once came close to calling his lawyer after receiving a fake script for an episode that would have seen his character, Frank, get sent to jail — and let's just say bad things happen from there. The actor was angered by what he read and refused to shoot the episode, but when he got to the last line of the script he discovered it was an April's Fool prank. Rather than let this slide, DeVito got revenge by staging an elaborate prank of his own.In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, DeVito revealed that he convinced a hotel worker to put his...See full article at Slash Film9/16/2025by Kieran FisherSlash FilmKingdom Of The Crystal Skull Has A Young Indiana Jones Reference You Probably MissedIn Steven Spielberg's 2008 adventure film "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" (you can read /Film's ranking of all the "Indiana Jones" movies here), the tenacious archaeologist/adventurer Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) becomes embroiled in a plot involving a missing acquaintance (John Hurt), the Soviets, and a quest to find the titular crystal skull, an artifact potentially hidden deep in the jungles of Peru.

On September 3, Gunn shared that his new movie "Man of Tomorrow" is currently due out in July 2027, featuring the return of Superman (David Corenswet) and Lex Luthor (Nicholas Hoult) to the big screen.We'll see if the film arrives in theaters with that title, though. Remember, Gunn originally titled his Superman movie "Superman: Legacy" before he announced he had cut the subtitle in February 2024. Next year's "Supergirl" was similarly retitled from "Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow".In an interview with Rolling Stone shortly before the release of "Superman,...See full article at Slash Film9/16/2025by Devin MeenanSlash FilmRobert Redford Deserved An Oscar Nomination For This Film With Almost No DialogueThe first time I saw "All Is Lost," I was underwhelmed. It was 2013, and although I admired the craftsmanship of writer/director J.C. Chandor's survival drama, the film didn't really resonate with me on a deeper emotional level. But perhaps that's not so surprising. It's not, to quote Vulture critic Alison Willmore, "an old man's movie, and I don't mean that as a criticism" in the manner of Spike Lee's "Highest 2 Lowest," a film that's all about legacy and examining what you've done with your life upon reaching a crossroads. It is, however, a story about finding yourself stuck in a mess of your own making and...See full article at Slash Film9/16/2025by Sandy SchaeferSlash FilmMarc Weinstock Exits as Paramount’s Worldwide Marketing PresidentParamount executive Marc Weinstock will be exiting his role as president of worldwide marketing and distribution.His departure follows Paramount’s recent merger with Skydance, which has resulted in several significant executive shuffles. News broke over the weekend that Josh Goldstine, the former Warner Bros. marketing chief, is finalizing a contract to take over as head of marketing and distribution at Paramount.Weinstock, a respected executive who spearheaded the campaigns for box office hits like “Top Gun: Maverick” and “Smile,” first joined Paramount in February 2019 as president of worldwide marketing and distribution. He was elevated in 2022 to oversee the studio’s unified global marketing and distribution team. During his run at the studio, Weinstock oversaw the rollout for 20 films that were No. 1 at the box office, including 2022’s “Top Gun: Maverick,” which helped usher audiences back to theaters after the pandemic and became the studio’s highest grossing film in history; “Smile,...See full article at Variety - Film News9/16/2025by Rebecca RubinVariety - Film NewsHaifaa Al Mansour on Saudi Thriller ‘Unidentified’ and Depicting the ‘Intricacies of a Culture Where Sexism and Violence Against Women Are Rampant’Pioneering Saudi Arabian filmmaker Haifaa Al Mansour has come a long way since secretly directing her 2012 drama “Wadjda,” which made waves as the first film shot in Saudi during a time when filmmaking was banned in the kingdom. After lifting the ban in 2017, her country has come a long way, too.Post “Wadjda,” Al Mansour — who now divides her time between Los Angeles and her home country — has helmed two Hollywood productions: “Mary Shelley,” starring Elle Fanning, and rom-com “Nappily Ever After.” She has also directed several episodes of major U.S. TV series such as “Fear the Walking Dead.”Al Mansour has also made two subsequent movies in Saudi. First the 2019 dramedy “The Perfect Candidate,” about a young female physician who maneuvers through the male-dominated society to run in municipal elections. And, more recently, her new film “Unidentified,” a thriller that revolves around the discovery of the lifeless body...See full article at Variety - Film News9/16/2025by Nick VivarelliVariety - Film NewsA Big Bold Beautiful Journey review – Margot Robbie and Colin Farrell play the game of loveGiddy romantic fantasy sends its two commitment-phobe leads on a magical road trip through their pasts that may lead them back to loveKorean-American auteur Kogonada has until now been known for his intriguingly complex, cerebral essayistic movies, such as Columbus and After Yang, whose emotional content, though potent, isn’t immediately obvious. Now he has made the leap into a big, bold, primary-coloured romantic phantasmagoria, as if Chris Marker had remade The Umbrellas of Cherbourg for the American multiplex with two unfeasibly beautiful Hollywood stars. This is a musical without musical numbers and a romantic comedy mostly without comedy – an imbalance it shares with most romcoms in fact.

You remember the one. It was a work of magical realism, and it dealt with really heady, mature, adult themes. It had a lot of cussing in it, but also incorporated a musical number from your favorite stage show in high school. Although the main characters were humans, there was a whimsical scene wherein a minor trickster god took control of the action. You were convinced it was following ancient literary traditions handed down from Gilgamesh, but it also had explicit pop culture references. And it all climaxed with two adults confessing that they may...See full article at Slash Film9/16/2025by Witney SeiboldSlash Film‘A Big Bold Beautiful Journey’ Review: Tonally Uneven Romantic Fantasy Fails Co-Stars Margot Robbie and Colin FarrellCinema often requires a certain suspension of disbelief. But what happens when a movie demands too much of it, without providing the viewer any emotional reasons to justify the leap? That is, in a nutshell, the experience of watching “A Big Bold Beautiful Journey,” an idiosyncratic romantic fantasy that never quite manages to sell the against-the-odds love story unfolding between its two incredibly alluring commitment-phobes, Margot Robbie’s Sarah and Colin Farrell’s David, who meet at a wedding.That’s too bad, as director Kogonada is certainly the kind of observant artist who can mine reserves of humanity and melancholy in the most unexpected of places — from the sharp edges of modern architecture (“Columbus”) to the data bank of an android (“After Yang”). But part of the problem here is an already insubstantial script that doesn’t have its directorial match. While “A Big Bold Beautiful Journey” is concerned with the ways memory,...See full article at Variety - Film News9/16/2025by Tomris LafflyVariety - Film News‘A Big Bold Beautiful Journey’ Review: Kogonada’s Big Bore Is Neither Bold Nor BeautifulThat Kogonada is neither a writer nor editor credited on his third feature is the first worrying road sign on this “Big Bold Beautiful Journey,” roles he maintained on both the coolly observed, intellectual romance “Columbus” and the cozy, ruminative AI sci-fi “After Yang.”His latest film, a drawn-out, time-hopping romance between Colin Farrell and Margot Robbie as script-y stick figures trapped by a sentient rental car into literally driving down the memory lane of their most formative episodes, features both embarrassingly earnest writing and nonsensical, incoherent editing. Perhaps someone could have asked the film’s director to step away from the camera and in on either front.Pairing Kogonada with screenwriter Seth Reiss’ (“The Menu”) disaster-bound dump truck of cliches feels like an insult to and an underestimation of the Cannes-crowned filmmaker’s prior proven bona fides: It’s not a drama, it’s not a comedy, it’s not a romance,...See full article at Indiewire9/16/2025by Ryan LattanzioIndiewire50 moreIMDb.com, Inc. takes no responsibility for the content or accuracy of the above news articles, Tweets, or blog posts.
