In an era when procedural crime television was a more crowded genre than ever, the seven-season CBS drama put itself above the competition. For its time and place, the show was a bit more high-concept than was typical, due in part to the sensibilities of creator and showrunner Bruno Heller, who also co-created the groundbreaking HBO epic "Rome."If you didn't catch the show back in the day, and you haven't gone back for a binge in the decade since it left the air, "The Mentalist" follows the exploits of former con-man and pseudo-psychic Patrick Jane, plated with peak charisma and poise by Australian actor Simon Baker.See full article at Slash Film9/18/2025by Rick StevensonSlash FilmJimmy Kimmel Being Pulled from Air ‘Indefinitely’ by ABC over Charlie Kirk CommentsJimmy Kimmel and his late night talk show “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” are being “pre-empted indefinitely,” an ABC Spokesperson told IndieWire.Several affiliate stations, including the largest in the country Nexstar, had objected to recent remarks by Kimmel about Charlie Kirk’s assassination, and in the wake of multiple threats, ABC and parent company Disney have taken that next step.“Nexstar’s owned and partner television stations affiliated with the ABC Television Network will preempt Jimmy Kimmel Live! for the foreseeable future beginning with tonight’s show.

During a flashback to 1965, a group of scientists prepare to inject themselves with an unnatural blue liquid — which, to fans of “The Boys,” is clearly an early iteration of the superpower-bestowing Compound V — while one rogue team member rushes to stop them. But by the time Dr. Thomas Godolkin (Ethan Slater) breaks through the locked door to the Odessa Project and confronts his fellow labcoats, it’s too late. They’ve taken the substance, and before the untainted Tommy can reach the question mark at the end of “Do you feel anything,” it’s gruesomely evident that they do.Once all the mutated butt intestines burn up in a fire started by, I’m assuming, flammable gas, “Gen V” jumps back to the present, where right-wing psychopaths frame their corporate-backed heroes next to Abraham Lincoln and label their democratically elected enemies as...See full article at Indiewire9/17/2025by Ben TraversIndiewireHamish Linklater's Terrifying Gen V Villain Drew From An Unlikely Source [Exclusive]The main antagonist on "The Boys," Homelander (Antony Starr), is so sadistically vicious that it's hard to imagine a villain ever coming close to matching his freak, but the new dean of Godolkin University in "Gen V" season 2 is refusing to let Soldier Boy's Boy suck up all the evil glory for himself.

One could imagine great affinity between the fundamentalist religious conservatives of the U.S. and Islamic fundamentalism, if it weren’t for that pesky issue of racism and the reactive Islamophobia that comes with it.Which is why it’s such a stirring jolt to watch Farnoosh Samadi’s “Between Dreams and Hope,” one of the best films about a trans romance in some time… that also happens to be from Iran.

Now, Lilith Fair itself nearly feels like the stuff of myth, almost three decades after the festival’s brief three-year heyday. In a new Hulu documentary, “Lilith Fair: Building a Mystery,” current pop superstar Olivia Rodrigo expresses her wonderment at having only recently learned of the existence of such a thing as an all-women festival featuring most of her musical heroines. Whether you were around at the time or are learning about it afresh, like Rodrigo, you may spend the entirety of the doc wishing we could get ourselves back to the garden.Director Ally Pankiw does a solid job of...See full article at Variety - Film News9/17/2025by Chris WillmanVariety - Film NewsAva DuVernay Returns to the Morelia International Film Festival to Lead 2025 JuryMexico’s leading film festival, founded in the capital of Michoacán in 2003 to celebrate auteur cinema, this year welcomes Oscar-nominated filmmaker Ava DuVernay as Jury President of the 23rd Morelia International Film Festival.

FiresLynette Howell Taylor knows how to get things done.She’s produced everything from action movies (“The Accountant”) to indies (“Half Nelson”) to Lady Gaga’s big-screen debut (“A Star Is Born”), all while dealing with movie-star egos, unforgiving budgets and punishing shooting schedules. Now, Howell Taylor, 46, will need to draw on all those skills as she faces her most daunting challenge yet.

After all, Trump has only dropped by the show in-person once before. But Fox News’ PR team held off on announcing the in-studio aspect of his visit when they alerted the usual political reporters in advance. Instead, the network opted to be cautious in the wake of the assassination of political activist Charlie Kirk less than 48 hours earlier. Likewise, Vice President Jd Vance abruptly canceled a live sit-down with Martha MacCallum at Fox News’ midtown headquarters — already one of the most fortressed buildings in Manhattan with massive planters that surround the entire perimeter — hours earlier despite the fact that the interview had not yet been publicized.See full article at Variety - Film News9/17/2025by Tatiana SiegelVariety - Film NewsIsrael’s culture minister threatens national film awards after Palestinian story takes top prizeMiki Zohar says he will cancel funding for the Ophir awards after The Sea, about a 12-year-old Palestinian boy who is denied entry to Tel Aviv, wins best pictureIsrael’s culture minister, Miki Zohar, has announced that funding for the Ophirs, the country’s national film awards, would be cancelled after The Sea, a film about a 12-year-old Palestinian boy, won the best feature film prize.In a statement on X, translated by Israeli news media, Zohar said: “There is no greater slap in the face of Israeli citizens than the embarrassing and detached annual Ophir awards ceremony.

After all, Redford’s striking looks and magnetism had turned the likes of “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid” and “The Way We Were” into blockbusters, but they had also led critics to dismiss him as just another pretty face.“He was an artist who was trapped in this incredibly handsome body,” says Phil Alden Robinson, who directed Redford in 1992’s “Sneakers.” “It can be hard to be taken seriously when you’re that good-looking.”Redford, who died Sept. 16 at the age of 89, didn’t allow himself to be defined by Hollywood. Instead, he subverted his squeaky-clean persona in films like “The Candidate,” “Downhill Racer” and “All the President’s Men,” which looked critically at the media,...See full article at Variety - Film News9/17/2025by Brent LangVariety - Film News‘In Proximity’ Podcast Returns for Season 3 With ‘Him’ Filmmaker Justin Tipping, ‘The Bear’s’ Courtney Storer Among Guests (Exclusive)The popular “In Proximity” podcast is set to return for Season 3, this time hosted by Proximity Media’s head of audio Paola Mardo.In a trailer for the new season, Proximity co-founder and “Sinners” director Ryan Coogler passes the microphone to Mardo and explains why they tapped her to host. “We think you got an incredible voice, you know, both artistically and like your literal voice,” Coogler says, smiling. “It’s kind of the perfect podcasting voice — so soothing, relaxing, kind of like Asmr.”Season 3 of the podcast, which has been a Webby Award honoree for each of its first two installments, will launch on Sept. 22.
