Movie newsRobert Pattinson Read ‘The Batman 2’ Script From a ‘High-Security’ Locked ‘Pouch’; ‘Penguin’ Season 2 Is ‘In Discussions,’ Matt Reeves SaysAfter nearly four years since “The Batman” became a blockbuster in 2022, the script for “Part II” is finally done and shooting is set to begin early next year.“We start shooting [the film] in spring, probably around the end of April or beginning of May,” director Matt Reeves told Variety‘s Marc Malkin on the Emmys red carpet. “It’s been a long journey, but I am so incredibly excited. I’m really proud of the script me and Mattson [Tomlin] did, and we’ve started to share it with Robert [Pattinson].”Reeves revealed his excitement for coming back to the gritty world of Gotham and the lengths “The Batman” team had to go to keep the script under wraps. “We put [the script] into a secret pouch that literally has a lock on it with a code. [Pattinson] was in New York at the time, and everything is high security.”After finishing reading the script, Pattinson...See full article at Variety - Film News9/14/2025by Leia MendozaVariety - Film News‘Hamnet’ wins the 2025 TIFF People’s Choice AwardThe play was the thing for audiences at the 50th edition of the Toronto International Film Festival.

While Doherty only appears in one of the four episodes of the Netflix miniseries, it is a marathon two-hander of a story, wherein Ariston assesses teen murderer Jamie Miller’s (Owen Cooper) mental state and awareness of his own guilt.Executive producer, co-writer, and star Stephen Graham charged his collaborator, executive producer and co-writer Jack Thorne, with turning this episode of “Adolescence” into a “Mamet play.” Thorne and then the show’s crew had to figure out a number of structural and logistical hurdles to nail so that the audience is fully immersed in the back and forth between the two characters, sitting at a table across from each other in an empty playroom on a rainy day. But it is squarely on Doherty’s shoulders to guide the...See full article at Indiewire9/15/2025by Sarah ShachatIndiewire‘Severance’ Creator Dan Erickson on Season 3: ‘We Know the End,’ but We’re ‘Playing Jazz a Little Bit’“Severance” has already picked up two Primetime Emmy wins on Sunday night — from stars Britt Lower and Tramell Tillman — but earlier in the evening, creator Dan Erickson spoke to IndieWire about what’s next for the series.“We know the end, and we don’t really know how we’re getting there,” Erickson said on the red carpet. “We have some idea of how we’re getting there, but we definitely like to be open to playing jazz a little bit and changing things as we go along, falling in love with characters that we didn’t necessarily expect to fall in love with, and incorporating them into the story in new ways.

Roxana Zal, who won an Emmy in 1984 for the special “Something About Amelia,” remains the youngest winner ever in any category at age 14.But especially notable for Cooper is that his Emmy win came for his first on-screen performance of his career. He’s already parlayed the acclaim he’s received for his work into playing a young Heathcliffe (who grows into Jacob Elordi) in Emerald Fennell’s upcoming “Wuthering Heights” adaptation.Cooper won over a field that also included his “Adolescence” co-star Ashley Waters, as well as a bunch of seasoned actors many years his senior,...See full article at Indiewire9/15/2025by Brian WelkIndiewire‘Hacks’ Will End with Upcoming Season 5, as Emmy Winner Hannah Einbinder Revealed“Hacks” is about to have its curtain call.

What's more, when the first season debuted on May 25, 2023, it had been three decades since James Cameron's $100 million action comedy bowed in theaters. Perhaps a new generation was ready to embrace a more sanitized streaming version of a movie they'd never seen?

In 2000, he famously released two major Oscar contenders with "Traffic" and "Erin Brockovich." 2002 saw the release of his drama "Full Frontal" and his sci-fi epic "Solaris." 2009 was the year of both "The Girlfriend Experience" and "The Informant!," while 2011 had the two-fer of "Contagion" and "Haywire."

For Romain Gavras, son of the legendary “Z” director and political critic Costa-Gavras, the count now stands at three. First, there was his 2010 debut, “Our Day Will Come,” an unnerving call-to-action in which redheads inherit the earth, followed by the white-knuckle “Athena,” about an uprising in a Paris apartment bloc. Now comes the splashy “Sacrifice,” which takes a more satirical view of ecoterrorism and the end of days.“Sacrifice” feels like the music-video director’s reaction to Ruben Östlund’s brand of comedy, an elevated form of irony that has earned the Swedish director (who started out making snowboarding videos for a ski resort) two Palme d’Or trophies for his films “Triangle of Sadness” and “The Square.” There’s...See full article at Variety - Film News9/14/2025by Peter DebrugeVariety - Film NewsWhat Happened To David Lynch's Twin Peaks Spin-Off Starring Sherilyn FennFew television series have ever gotten off to a stronger start than "Twin Peaks." Created by Mark Frost and David Lynch, "Twin Peaks" was an instant sensation when ABC aired the pilot on April 8, 1990; the broadcast attracted a whopping 34.6 million viewers after getting hyped to the heavens by many of its era's leading media outlets. Frost and Lynch brilliantly baited the hook in the pilot with the mystery that would have people wildly speculating for the rest of the TV season: Who killed Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee)?

He was just about everywhere, making critically and commercially successful crowd-pleasers that also notched up Academy Award nominations, producing other box office hits like "Poltergeist," and founding Amblin Entertainment, a production company (itself named after a short film Spielberg once made) that churned out even more big moneymakers like "Gremlins" and "Back to the Future." Yet, for all his clout and undoubted artistic talent, there were still regular accusations of sentimentality. I tend to agree in some cases.

Top notes, middle notes and low notes, and different combinations of minerals, spices, smoke and salt make each sip trigger new associations before you even reach the peaty finish. “Glenrothan,” the directorial debut of Scottish actor Brian Cox, is set around a distillery nestled in the Highlands that has long produced a much-admired single-malt dram to an original recipe. So it’s unfortunate that the film itself is more like a bottom-shelf blend: easily drinkable, highly forgettable, bland. Worse still, it won’t get you even mildly buzzed.It is very quickly established, through shots of the pretty white distillery buildings and the wooded green hills made velvety by the soft Scottish sunshine, that we’re in a storyland, tourist-board version of the country, and that’s fine.

His TV career up to that point had mostly involved writing Westerns and cop shows, usually finding steady gigs as a writer-for-hire. Not only did "Star Trek" change the industry's perception of him — he was now a sci-fi guy — but he was associated with its failure. In 1969, the cult audience for "Star Trek" was still rather small, and fan conventions weren't yet common.Throughout the 1970s, Roddenberry tried, unsuccessfully, to get other major TV and film projects off the ground.

Studios are eager to be in business with him, and it certainly helps his cause that he enjoys making commercial films from time to time (as evidenced by his "Equalizer" movies). So, post-stardom, if he regrets making or not making a film, he only has himself to blame.Personally, even though Denzel Washington is my favorite living actor, I do think he's made some mistakes over the years. The formula thriller "The Bone Collector" was limp material that confined him to a bed for most of the movie, while the hospital hostage drama "John Q" was formulaic pap.See full article at Slash Film9/14/2025by Jeremy SmithSlash FilmWhy Superman Was A Villain In Batman: The Dark Knight ReturnsFrank Miller is a living comic book legend. For Batman fans, though, the greatest part of Miller's legacy is always going to be him writing and pencilling "The Dark Knight Returns" in 1986 and then, the following year, writing "Batman: Year One" (drawn by David Mazzucchelli). Both are typically ranked as the two best and most influential Batman comics ever. Yet, they're almost polar opposites."Batman: Year One" is a stripped down crime story, complemented by Mazzucchelli's realistic art. It's appropriately about Bruce Wayne's first year being Batman and so is set in Gotham City before it became a home for costumed criminals. In "Year One," Batman only fights gangsters and Swat teams.See full article at Slash Film9/14/2025by Devin MeenanSlash FilmGlenn Howerton Joined A Star-Studded Cast In This Controversial Horror Movie"The Hunt" was bound to be controversial with its plot about wealthy liberal elites taking revenge on the pro-maga deplorables who perpetuated an internet conspiracy theory that they host elaborate parties where they hunt conservatives for fun. "Manorgate" causes Athena, a high-ranking corporate executive, and her friends to lose their jobs.The rocky road to "The Hunt" being released indicates just how much of a fractured time it was when the movie came out. When the trailer came out, filmmakers received death threats and President Trump, while not directly referencing the title, tweeted that violent and racist "Liberal Hollywood" "create their own violence, and then try to blame others," and...See full article at Slash Film9/14/2025by Caroline MaddenSlash FilmKristen Stewart on Her Favorite French Films, From Catherine Breillat to Leos Carax and Michael HanekeKristen Stewart drew a packed house of festivalgoers, locals and fans at France’s Deauville Film Festival for her masterclass titled My French Cinema and organized with Chanel. For the occasion, Stewart curated a list of her all-time favorite French movies and candidly discussed why they inspired her as an actor and filmmaker.Ranging across different eras and styles, the films she chose have in common a certain boldness, from Louis Malle’s “Elevator to the Gallows” (1958) to Alain Renais’ “Hiroshima Mon Amour” (1959), Catherine Breillat’s “A Real Young Girl” (1976), Leos Carax’s “The Lovers on the Bridge” (1991), Krzysztof Kieślowski’s “The Double Life of Veronique” (1991) and Michael Haneke’s “The Piano Lesson” (2001).In her typical unfiltered, brainy and self-deprecating fashion, Stewart made the audience laugh as she admitted that she actually struggles to watch entire movies.“It sounds fucking absurd coming from me,” Stewart said, “considering it’s what...See full article at Variety - Film News9/14/2025by Elsa KeslassyVariety - Film NewsDownton Abbey: The Grand Finale Proves How Essential The Franchise's Best Character WasThis article contains spoilers for "Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale."If it feels like we've been saying goodbye to "Downton Abbey" for a long time now, that's because we have. The ITV period melodrama initially ended in 2015 with the sixth series' Christmas special. Just about every character received as best of a send off as they could possibly get. But with the show exploding into a global phenomenon, it was inevitable that it would return in some form or another. The result of this was a trilogy of theatrically-released feature films that teased the incoming train of progress, while not straying too far from the status quo.

But which is the greatest? Names that spring to mind include the Great Train Robbery in the UK, the Lufthansa Heist (which played a key role in "Goodfellas"), and, more recently, the Antwerp diamond theft hailed as the "heist of the century." Those crimes pulled off record hauls, but in terms of sheer audacity, D.B Cooper parachuting out of a hijacked airplane with a bag of cash takes some beating.

Its haul more than doubled the $31 million benchmark that had been set by 1999’s “Pokémon: The First Movie – Mewtwo Strikes Back.”“Infinity Castle,” the first installment in what is meant to be a series-capping trilogy for the property, is playing in both subtitled and dubbed versions. It is also showing in many premium large format theaters such as Imax, which carry steeper ticket prices and add to its haul. “Infinity Castle” has already earned more than $300 million globally, including more than $200 million in its native Japan where it has become the country’s third-highest-grossing release of all time.Sony’s anime distribution banner, Crunchyroll, backed the film and gave the studio a big hit after a relatively quiet summer...See full article at Variety - Film News9/14/2025by Brent LangVariety - Film NewsHamnet wins top award at the Toronto film festivalChloé Zhao’s Shakespeare drama has picked up the people’s choice award, which has become predictor of Oscar successChloé Zhao’s adaptation of Hamnet has won this year’s people’s choice award at the Toronto film festival.The acclaimed drama, based on Maggie O’Farrell’s award-winning novel, stars Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal and tells a fictionalised account of William Shakespeare and wife Agnes as they grieve for their young son.See full article at The Guardian - Film News9/14/2025by Benjamin LeeThe Guardian - Film News12 Awesome Anime That Deserve A Live-Action MovieWhile some might understandably consider it blasphemy, the fact of the matter is, there are successful live-action adaptations of many popular anime projects. The most prominent example of this effective translation in media is Netflix's delightful "One Piece" live-action series, adapting the globally beloved pirate action anime. Over in Japan, anime has an even longer history of being reimagined in live-action with varying degrees of reception from critics and audiences. Classic anime like "Grave of the Fireflies" and "Rurouni Kenshin" have received decent live-action adaptations, proving not every such project is as doomed as "Dragonball Evolution."Simply put, a good story can exist in both animation and live-action -– it's a mutually exclusive approach,...See full article at Slash Film9/14/2025by Samuel StoneSlash Film‘Hamnet’ Wins Toronto Film Festival Audience AwardChloé Zhao’s “Hamnet” captured the Toronto International Film Festival’s highly coveted people’s choice award, bolstering its Oscars chances. In addition, Zhao is the first director to win the award twice, coming after her 2020 victory for “Nomadland.”Since the Academy expanded the best picture field in 2009, TIFF Audience Award winners have become reliable Oscar barometers. Films such as “Green Book” (2018) and “Nomadland” (2020) went on to claim the top prize, while others like “The Fabelmans” (2022) factored heavily into awards season. Only one winner, “Where Do We Go Now?” (2011), failed to secure a best picture nom.Every other winner has claimed at least one Oscar. Last year’s winner, “The Life of Chuck,” which Neon delayed to 2025, faces an uphill battle this year to maintain that streak given its June release date, but it could show up in adapted screenplay.The people’s choice category was created in 1978.

He's gotten to show off his sick PowerPoint skills, kill an angry super-gorilla, and help save the world from an alien invasion in a slightly more hands-on role than he did in the 2021 movie "The Suicide Squad." He'd proven himself to be an impressively good friend even when it seems like he's a disaffected loner, trying to help the 11th Street Kids in any way he can, even if that's from inside A.R.G.U.S., the very organization trying to make some of their lives much more difficult.See full article at Slash Film9/14/2025by Danielle RyanSlash FilmWhy Foundation Brought In A Fan-Favorite Book Storyline Ahead Of Time [Exclusive]This article contains spoilers for "Foundation" season 3, episode 10, "The Darkness.""Foundation" season 3 has officially come and gone. David S. Goyer's magnificent adaptation has continued to adeptly integrate the numerous elements of Isaac Asimov's sprawling interstellar story into a compelling and semi-accurate show. Even better? Season 3 finally got to the part in the book series where the narrative comes together and the stakes get higher — and Goyer and company delivered. Most of this new momentum focused on the season 3 villain.

After a nearly two-week frenzy of premieres, screenings, red carpets, parties, and some extremely tired journalists (ahem), this year’s Toronto International Film Festival ends today. And, as usual, the annual fest ended both in style and with a pretty logical endpoint: a Sunday morning awards ceremony.Right to it: This year’s winner, and the first filmmaker to take home two People’s Choice Awards, is Chloé Zhao for her “Hamnet.” (The filmmaker previously won in 2020 with her “Nomadland.”)This year’s ceremony included the presentation of a number of awards, from the much-anticipated People’s Choice Award to a pair of brand-new accolades, the International People’s Choice Award and Best Animated Short Film.But it’s the People’s Choice Award that draws the most attention, particularly this early in the awards season.

The Marvel Universe already has analogues to the Xenomorphs: the alien parasites called the Brood, most known for their fights with the X-Men.If you're only familiar with the stripped down and faux-realistic "X-Men" movies, then you'll be surprised how fantastical the comics can get. Aliens are a big part of the totemic 1975-1991 "X-Men" run by Chris Claremont, whereas it took until the 2019 "Dark Phoenix" film for the cinematic X-Men to tussle with little green men.See full article at Slash Film9/14/2025by Devin MeenanSlash Film50 moreIMDb.com, Inc. takes no responsibility for the content or accuracy of the above news articles, Tweets, or blog posts.
