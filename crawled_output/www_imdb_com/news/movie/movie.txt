"Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle" led the way with a record-breaking $70 million opening. Everything else was gunning for second place. Well, technically third, given that "The Conjuring: Last Rites" ($25.6 million) landed in the number two spot following its own massive opening last week.

He lived on a boat named Erotica. Between boat parties, Kennedy found the peace he was seeking when he formed an unexpected bond with a giant, 22-foot oceanic manta ray that Kennedy named Willy. The fish would slap his wings against the hull of Kennedy’s sailboat, signalling that he wanted to swim with Kennedy. For 19 years, Kennedy held on to Willy’s back as they explored the ocean’s depths. Kennedy took numerous videos of his time with Willy and other manta rays, which allowed the scientific community to study the fish extensively.“The Last Dive” follows Kennedy,...See full article at Variety - Film News9/15/2025by Addie MorfootVariety - Film NewsThe Sequel To A Comedy Masterpiece Is A Regrettable Box Office FlopThe weekend of September 12 proved to be a surprisingly busy one at the box office, even though, on paper, it didn't seem like it would be.

The boys-only cadre of helmers included Gareth Edwards (“Jurassic World: Rebirth”), James Gunn (“Superman”), Joseph Kosinski (“F1”), and Len Wiseman (“Ballerina”). While women directed a few smaller budget films, such as “Freakier Friday” (Nisha Ganatra) and “Materialists” (Celine Song), once again Hollywood awarded the highest-profile directing gigs with the largest budgets, and thus the largest grosses generally speaking, to men.Writing for The New Yorker about the dearth of big budget films with women directors back in 2015, film critic Richard Roeper predicted, “Today’s leading independent visionaries are tomorrow’s acknowledged auteurs.” He went on to suggest that indie directors such as Miranda July, Sophia Takal, Amy Seimetz, and others would mimic the career paths of their male counterparts, transitioning from indie features to big budget films.
