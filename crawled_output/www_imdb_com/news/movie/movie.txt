Movie newsStephen Graham Wins First Acting Emmy for ‘Adolescence’With 13 total nominations for its heart-stopping four episodes, Netflix’s smash hit limited series “Adolescence” seemed destined to clean up at this year’s Emmys ceremony. One big question entering Sunday, though, would that love be spread above and below the line?Star and co-creator Stephen Graham might have wondered about the same thing, but with two Emmys, including both his first Emmy win for acting and writing in the bag, he’s got plenty to celebrate.On Sunday evening, Graham first picked up the Emmy Outstanding Writing for a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie (shared with Jack Thorne) and then added to his total tally with his win for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie, beating out other major names like Colin Farrell (“The Penguin”), Jake Gyllenhaal (“Presumed Innocent”), Cooper Coch (“Monster”), and Brian Tyree Henry (“Dope Thief”).Upon hitting the stage for the second time this evening,...See full article at Indiewire9/15/2025by Kate ErblandIndiewireRobert Pattinson Read ‘The Batman 2’ Script From a ‘High-Security’ Locked ‘Pouch’; ‘Penguin’ Season 2 Is ‘In Discussions,’ Matt Reeves SaysAfter nearly four years since “The Batman” became a blockbuster in 2022, the script for “Part II” is finally done and shooting is set to begin early next year.“We start shooting [the film] in spring, probably around the end of April or beginning of May,” director Matt Reeves told Variety‘s Marc Malkin on the Emmys red carpet. “It’s been a long journey, but I am so incredibly excited. I’m really proud of the script me and Mattson [Tomlin] did, and we’ve started to share it with Robert [Pattinson].”Reeves revealed his excitement for coming back to the gritty world of Gotham and the lengths “The Batman” team had to go to keep the script under wraps. “We put [the script] into a secret pouch that literally has a lock on it with a code.

Garbage was piling up, rats were everywhere — in other words, it was the perfect time to make art in cheap lofts and create disruptive social movements like no-wave cinema and punk rock. This was the backdrop against which Lizzie Borden set her micro-budget dystopian feminist movie “Born in Flames,” which was released in 1983 after five years of scrappy guerrilla production on the streets of Manhattan.For those who might not have caught “Born in Flames” at a retrospective screening — or for those who saw it back in the ’80s and don’t remember how far ahead of its time it was — the Criterion Collection is releasing the restored film on Blu-Ray Tuesday with a commentary track from the director and cast members, an interview with Borden and as her earlier experimental film “Regrouping.”In the 40-plus years since, “Born in Flames...See full article at Variety - Film News9/15/2025by Pat SapersteinVariety - Film NewsToronto Hit ‘The Condor Daughter,’ a High Andes Drama, Gets a First Trailer From Bendita Film Sales (Exclusive)Arguably the biggest buzz title at Ventana Sur and well received by those who caught it on its Sept. 9 world premiere at last week’s Toronto Festival, Bolivian identity drama “The Condor Daughter” (“La Hija del Condor”) now has a trailer, shared in exclusivity with Variety by the film’s sales agent, Spain’s Bendita Film Sales.Written, directed and produced by Empatia Cinema’s Álvaro Olmos Torrico, a key figure on Bolivia’s cinema scene, “The Condor’s Daughter” was chosen by Variety among 20 International Titles to Track at TIFF.Produced by Empatia Cinema, with Peru’s Ayara Producciones and Uruguay’s Lamayor Cine, “The Condor Daughter” turns on Clara, 16, part of the Totorani Quechua community and her midwife mother Ana’s assistant, living high in the Andes..The trailer takes in many of the key plot beats.

In the cover photo, Carpenter (wearing a small black dress and high-heeled shoes) is posing on her hands and knees in front of an anonymous man. The man's face is out of frame, but his fist is holding a tuft of Carpenter's hair. The image evokes a distinctly sexual vibe, wherein Carpenter is this anonymous man's pet-like plaything; the two are seemingly playing a sub/dom-style sex game. There's nothing explicitly sexual about the image, but it is certainly provocative.The controversy comes from some...See full article at Slash Film9/15/2025by Witney SeiboldSlash FilmThe Emmys Taught Us a Valuable Lesson: Live Awards Shows Need the Support of the Live AudienceThe most frustrating part of this year’s Primetime Emmy Awards was the wasted potential. Multiple records were broken, there were many history-making wins, plus upsets galore, and yet all anyone is talking about is a bit that wore out its welcome the second the Boys & Girls Club charity pot went from six figures to five.Walking into the lobby of the Peacock Theater on a particularly muggy Sunday afternoon, there was actually a lot of enthusiasm for comedian Nate Bargatze’s first stint as host.

The gag of the film, of course, is that most of the outcasts they encounter are unpopular characters culled from the last 20 years of superhero cinema. Chris Evans, for example, plays the Human Torch, a role he originated in 2005's "Fantastic Four."

So, what's next for Apple TV+'s mind-bending sci-fi adaptation? "Foundation" is based on five books and two prequels written by Isaac Asimov. They're also set in the same universe as Asimov's robot novels. This gives us plenty to draw on to see what happens next.There is one caveat, though: The specific direction of the show is very much up in the air at the time of this writing. "Foundation" has been...See full article at Slash Film9/15/2025by Jaron PakSlash FilmHive Filmworks to sell Busan Competition drama ‘En Route To’Exclusive: South Korea’s Hive Filmworks has boarded sales of Yoo Jae-in’s En Route To, which is set to receive its world premiere in Busan’s first-ever Competition section.The film centres on high school student Yun-ji, who becomes pregnant after having an affair with her married teacher.

The short-tempered second-in-command to Perry (Jamie McShane) is a foreboding presence with his sights set on the unknown assailant who has stolen from him. For Irish-born actor Keeley, tapping into that kind of rage isn't anything new, given that Jayson doesn't seem too far away from a character he previously played that audiences from the other side of the pond learned to love and loathe. Back in 2021, Keeley joined a powerful family of Irish gangsters,...See full article at Slash Film9/15/2025by Nick StaniforthSlash FilmQueen of the Ring review – diner waitress turned first lady of the all-girl wrestling sceneGenial, entertaining indie movie about Mildred ‘Millie’ Burke, a single mother who became America’s first millionaire sportswoman, is a good yarnIn the coming months, there will be a lot of noise about it girl Sydney Sweeney’s transformation into boxer Christy Martin for David Michôd’s biopic Christy.

Roberto Benigni’s Italian comedy Johnny Stecchino is the exception. Yes, it’s farce, but it’s also sly social commentary, ridiculing the mafia without sanctifying its opposition, and playing with the gap between how things are and how they appear.Six years before his Oscar-winning role in Life is Beautiful introduced him to a global audience, Benigni wrote, directed and starred in this 1991 box office hit that instantly became a national classic.

Last year’s straight-to-streaming The Shepherd Code introduced Delabie’s Alex “the Shepherd” Lapierre – not the dutiful sheepherder that title conjures, but a hired assassin striving to go straight – with inevitable complications.

The director behind “Gangs of Wasseypur” and “Dev.D” has crafted another quintessential North Indian story with Amazon MGM Studios India’s “Nishaanchi,” but this time he’s trading gangsters for family drama.Set for theatrical release on Sept. 19, “Nishaanchi” stars newcomer Aaishvary Thackeray in a dynamic double role as twin brothers Babloo and Dabloo — “mirror images yet stark opposites in their beliefs” — alongside Vedika Pinto, Monika Panwar, Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub, and Kumud Mishra.“‘Wasseypur’ was more of a gangster film about very stupid, very low Iq gangsters,” Kashyap tells Variety. “And this is a film about a family.
