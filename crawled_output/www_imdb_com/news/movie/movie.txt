Now he has made the leap into a big, bold, primary-coloured romantic phantasmagoria, as if Chris Marker had remade The Umbrellas of Cherbourg for the American multiplex with two unfeasibly beautiful Hollywood stars.

Although the main characters were humans, there was a whimsical scene wherein a minor trickster god took control of the action.

But what happens when a movie demands too much of it, without providing the viewer any emotional reasons to justify the leap? That is, in a nutshell, the experience of watching “A Big Bold Beautiful Journey,” an idiosyncratic romantic fantasy that never quite manages to sell the against-the-odds love story unfolding between its two incredibly alluring commitment-phobes, Margot Robbie’s Sarah and Colin Farrell’s David, who meet at a wedding.That’s too bad, as director Kogonada is certainly the kind of observant artist who can mine reserves of humanity and melancholy in the most unexpected of places — from the sharp edges of modern architecture (“Columbus”) to the data bank of an android (“After Yang”). But part of the problem here is an already insubstantial script that doesn’t have its directorial match.

Perhaps someone could have asked the film’s director to step away from the camera and in on either front.Pairing Kogonada with screenwriter Seth Reiss’ (“The Menu”) disaster-bound dump truck of cliches feels like an insult to and an underestimation of the Cannes-crowned filmmaker’s prior proven bona fides: It’s not a drama, it’s not a comedy, it’s not a romance,...See full article at Indiewire9/16/2025by Ryan LattanzioIndiewire‘Superman’ Sets HBO Max Release Date“Superman” will fly onto HBO Max on Sept. 19, writer-director James Gunn announced on his social media pages.

There’s also “Kontinental ’25” — both films playing the New York Film Festival — which stars Eszter Tompa as a bailiff trying to assuage her own conscience after an eviction gone horribly wrong.But first up, “Dracula” will unleash from 1-2 Special in select theaters starting October 29, in time for Halloween, and after playing the New York Film Festival in late September.

There is much symmetry, and a specific yet simple foot movement one has to master in a rhythmic circle, a routine you engage in harmoniously alongside people you might not even know all that well.It takes a little guesswork to gauge what this opening halay number might symbolize across the often austere “Hemme,” a prizewinner in last year’s Venice Horizons program that has been selected as Turkey’s Best International Feature Oscar submission in the upcoming awards season.

For me, the '80s was the most Oscar-baity decade in the history of the Academy Awards, summed up by a series of staid, safe, and overly earnest films claiming the Best Picture prize: "Chariots of Fire," "Gandhi," "Terms of Endearment," and especially the controversial "Driving Miss Daisy." Although these movies were handsomely produced and impeccably acted, they were prestige pictures in the worst sense. Perhaps the peak '80s Oscar bait film was "Out of Africa," Sydney Pollack...See full article at Slash Film9/16/2025by Lee AdamsSlash FilmShari Redstone Joins Israeli Production Banner Sipur as ChairShari Redstone was not in the market for another studio gig. But the opportunity to invest in and join the board of Israel’s fast-growing Sipur production company was an opportunity she could not pass up — even as she’s still catching her breath from the long slog of selling Paramount Global to Skydance Media for $8 billion.Redstone has been named chair of Sipur, which is based in Tel Aviv and has grown rapidly since it was founded in 2019 by Emilio Schenker, who is CEO and prominent Israeli investor Gideon Tadmor. Redstone tells Variety exclusively that Sipur (which means “story” in Hebrew) will be a hands-on investment for her as she works to advance its mission of building a global production powerhouse.Redstone and Schenker met last year when Paramount picked up distribution rights to Sipur’s documentary “We Will Dance Again,” which chronicled the devastation of Hamas’ Oct. 7 terrorist...See full article at Variety - Film News9/16/2025by Cynthia LittletonVariety - Film NewsStar Trek: Strange New Worlds Season 4 Will Make One Major Change From Season 3"Star Trek: Strange New Worlds" is one of the most fun TV shows on the air, and part of an emerging new golden age for sci-fi in the streaming era of television.

The style was more a scuffed, grizzled, bleary, sweaty, paunchy and shlubby realness. The fashion was for leading men like Gene Hackman, Jack Nicholson, Woody Allen. Even a very beautiful man like Paul Newman had a kind of rugged, daylit quality.
