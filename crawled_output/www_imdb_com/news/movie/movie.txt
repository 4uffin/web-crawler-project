Movie newsStephen Graham Wins First Acting Emmy for ‘Adolescence’With 13 total nominations for its heart-stopping four episodes, Netflix’s smash hit limited series “Adolescence” seemed destined to clean up at this year’s Emmys ceremony. One big question entering Sunday, though, would that love be spread above and below the line?Star and co-creator Stephen Graham might have wondered about the same thing, but with two Emmys, including both his first Emmy win for acting and writing in the bag, he’s got plenty to celebrate.On Sunday evening, Graham first picked up the Emmy Outstanding Writing for a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie (shared with Jack Thorne) and then added to his total tally with his win for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie, beating out other major names like Colin Farrell (“The Penguin”), Jake Gyllenhaal (“Presumed Innocent”), Cooper Coch (“Monster”), and Brian Tyree Henry (“Dope Thief”).Upon hitting the stage for the second time this evening,...See full article at Indiewire9/15/2025by Kate ErblandIndiewireRobert Pattinson Read ‘The Batman 2’ Script From a ‘High-Security’ Locked ‘Pouch’; ‘Penguin’ Season 2 Is ‘In Discussions,’ Matt Reeves SaysAfter nearly four years since “The Batman” became a blockbuster in 2022, the script for “Part II” is finally done and shooting is set to begin early next year.“We start shooting [the film] in spring, probably around the end of April or beginning of May,” director Matt Reeves told Variety‘s Marc Malkin on the Emmys red carpet. “It’s been a long journey, but I am so incredibly excited. I’m really proud of the script me and Mattson [Tomlin] did, and we’ve started to share it with Robert [Pattinson].”Reeves revealed his excitement for coming back to the gritty world of Gotham and the lengths “The Batman” team had to go to keep the script under wraps. “We put [the script] into a secret pouch that literally has a lock on it with a code. [Pattinson] was in New York at the time, and everything is high security.”After finishing reading the script, Pattinson...See full article at Variety - Film News9/14/2025by Leia Mendoza and Marc MalkinVariety - Film News‘Hamnet’ wins the 2025 TIFF People’s Choice AwardThe play was the thing for audiences at the 50th edition of the Toronto International Film Festival.

That momentum continued all the way through the 77th Primetime Emmy Awards, as the show has won the Emmy for Outstanding Drama Series in its first season.Created by R. Scott Gemmill and executive produced by medical drama veteran John Wells, the show follows the doctors and nurses at an underfunded Pittsburgh emergency room over the course of a single, fateful, day. Each episode covers one hour of the day, allowing viewers to feel the urgency of medical professionals working in real time as they juggle multiple patients.As TV creators have continued to innovate and blur the boundaries with film in recent years, traditional genres like medical dramas have not exactly been trendy.

The win came as no surprise given the show’s staggering 23 nominations (a record for a comedy series in its first season) and nine wins at the Creative Arts Emmys (another comedy record) on September 6.“The Studio” follows the comic mishaps of Remick and his colleagues at Continental Studios, where Remick struggles to reconcile his love of cinema with the business demands of his job.

The mature, harrowing look at the family, school, and community affected by the murder through a set of four continuous-take episodes was produced by Mark Herbert, Emily Feller, Hannah Walters, Stephen Graham, Brad Pitt, Dede Gardner, Jeremy Kleiner, Nina Wolarsky, Jack Thorne, Philip Barantini, Carina Sposato, Niall Shamma, Peter Balm, and Jo Johnson.Among that list, of course, the chief co-conspirators are actor, co-writer, and executive producer Stephen Graham and executive producer and co-writer Jack Thorne.

At Sunday’s Emmy ceremony, the iconic talk show won for Outstanding Talk Series — a category it’s been nominated in nine times and never won. The nightly series bested reigning champion “The Daily Show” (which had won two years in a row) and “Jimmy Kimmel Live!”The latter program actually campaigned for Colbert following CBS’s controversial decision in July to cancel “The Late Show.” Citing a “challenging backdrop” for late-night TV, the powers-that-be axed the 33-year-old television staple in what they called “purely a financial decision.”However, Paramount Global (CBS’s parent company) was trying to close a deal to merge with Skydance at the time, which required approval from the FCC — a government agency controlled by the Trump administration.

There was such a burning life coming into being, and he’s an incredible actor,” Reeves told IndieWire on the red carpet at the Emmys, where he’s nominated for his work on “The Penguin.”The rest is history, and those videos set of a chain of events that led to Farrell’s Penguin getting his own HBO Max series.

While Doherty only appears in one of the four episodes of the Netflix miniseries, it is a marathon two-hander of a story, wherein Ariston assesses teen murderer Jamie Miller’s (Owen Cooper) mental state and awareness of his own guilt.Executive producer, co-writer, and star Stephen Graham charged his collaborator, executive producer and co-writer Jack Thorne, with turning this episode of “Adolescence” into a “Mamet play.” Thorne and then the show’s crew had to figure out a number of structural and logistical hurdles to nail so that the audience is fully immersed in the back and forth between the two characters, sitting at a table across from each other in an empty playroom on a rainy day.

Roxana Zal, who won an Emmy in 1984 for the special “Something About Amelia,” remains the youngest winner ever in any category at age 14.But especially notable for Cooper is that his Emmy win came for his first on-screen performance of his career.

What's more, when the first season debuted on May 25, 2023, it had been three decades since James Cameron's $100 million action comedy bowed in theaters. Perhaps a new generation was ready to embrace a more sanitized streaming version of a movie they'd never seen?

More recently, the streamers, along with television networks, have made it clear that they want to stay out of Donald Trump’s crosshairs, which means that their appetite for political doc fare is at an all-time low.Another blow...See full article at Variety - Film News9/14/2025by Addie MorfootVariety - Film News‘Sacrifice’ Review: Virtue-Signaling Billionaires Dance on the Edge of a Volcano in Romain Gavras’ Scattershot SatireHow many rebellious movies about ganging up to overthrow the status quo does one need to make before uneasy governments start to put you on some kind of watch list? For Romain Gavras, son of the legendary “Z” director and political critic Costa-Gavras, the count now stands at three. First, there was his 2010 debut, “Our Day Will Come,” an unnerving call-to-action in which redheads inherit the earth, followed by the white-knuckle “Athena,” about an uprising in a Paris apartment bloc. Now comes the splashy “Sacrifice,” which takes a more satirical view of ecoterrorism and the end of days.“Sacrifice” feels like the music-video director’s reaction to Ruben Östlund’s brand of comedy, an elevated form of irony that has earned the Swedish director (who started out making snowboarding videos for a ski resort) two Palme d’Or trophies for his films “Triangle of Sadness” and “The Square.” There’s...See full article at Variety - Film News9/14/2025by Peter DebrugeVariety - Film NewsWhat Happened To David Lynch's Twin Peaks Spin-Off Starring Sherilyn FennFew television series have ever gotten off to a stronger start than "Twin Peaks."

He was just about everywhere, making critically and commercially successful crowd-pleasers that also notched up Academy Award nominations, producing other box office hits like "Poltergeist," and founding Amblin Entertainment, a production company (itself named after a short film Spielberg once made) that churned out even more big moneymakers like "Gremlins" and "Back to the Future." Yet, for all his clout and undoubted artistic talent, there were still regular accusations of sentimentality. I tend to agree in some cases. I always preferred the more detached sense of wonder in "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" than the tear-jerking of "E.T;" and,...See full article at Slash Film9/14/2025by Lee AdamsSlash Film‘No Other Land’ Co-Director Basel Adra Says West Bank Home Raided by IdfBasel Adra, co-director of the 2025 Academy Award winner for Best Documentary Feature, “No Other Land,” has told the Associated Press that his home was raided by soldiers of the Israel Defense Forces September 13 following alleged settler violence in his West Bank village.Giving an on-camera interview to the AP, Adra is clearly free and not currently being detained by Israeli forces as was feared by his co-director Yuval Abraham who tweeted his concern about the situation. “Happening now: Israeli army raiding the house of oscar winner Basel Adra after Israeli settlers attacked his village earlier and beat up his family member,” Abraham tweeted September 13. “Soldiers could try to abduct Basel into one of Israel’s prisons which are effectively torture sites.”Adra was not abducted and remains free.However, the concern that he might be detained by the Idf apparently influenced Adra’s decision not to return to his home yesterday.See full article at Indiewire9/14/2025by Christian BlauveltIndiewireThe 15 Most Underrated X-Men Characters RankedThe X-Men are one of the most popular superhero teams from Marvel Comics, and have had quite a long history of being portrayed on-screen. Between the original "X-Men" movies, to the soft reboots starting with "X-Men: First Class," and their official debut in the Marvel Cinematic Universe in "Deadpool & Wolverine," the X-Men might be slated for their proper introduction into Marvel's film franchise, which might give a few underrated characters the opportunity to get some love on the big screen.At this point, audiences have become familiar with the likes of Wolverine, Jean Grey, Cyclops, and Professor X, but there are plenty of "X-Men" heroes and villains...See full article at Slash Film9/14/2025by Blaise SantiSlash Film‘Glenrothan’ Review: Brian Cox’s Overly Cozy Directorial Debut Needs a Good Belt of WhiskyComplexity is key to the flavor profile of a good single-malt whisky. Top notes, middle notes and low notes, and different combinations of minerals, spices, smoke and salt make each sip trigger new associations before you even reach the peaty finish. “Glenrothan,” the directorial debut of Scottish actor Brian Cox, is set around a distillery nestled in the Highlands that has long produced a much-admired single-malt dram to an original recipe. So it’s unfortunate that the film itself is more like a bottom-shelf blend: easily drinkable, highly forgettable, bland. Worse still, it won’t get you even mildly buzzed.It is very quickly established, through shots of the pretty white distillery buildings and the wooded green hills made velvety by the soft Scottish sunshine, that we’re in a storyland, tourist-board version of the country, and that’s fine. Not everything has to be “Trainspotting.” But Scotland is a place of such gorgeous,...See full article at Variety - Film News9/14/2025by Jessica KiangVariety - Film NewsThis Hit Marvel Movie With 88% On Rotten Tomatoes Was Saved From Being A DC Knock-OffWith so many movies having been churned out of the Marvel and DC universe, stories and the characters running around in them are guaranteed to get compared in some way. That was absolutely the case when it came to Marvel's newest band of misfits, the New Avengers, previously known as "Thunderbolts*." This ragtag team of not-so-great characters in the MCU fired off shots that were hitting in a very similar direction to a team of Dceu bad guys putting a shift in as good ones. The first was David Ayer's universally loathed "Suicide Squad" and the second was James Gunn's run at Task Force X, "The Suicide Squad.See full article at Slash Film9/14/2025by Nick StaniforthSlash FilmJulia Roberts, Sean Penn Host Screening for Brazilian Oscar Contender ‘Manas’: ‘It Will Change You’Sean Penn, Julia Roberts, and John and Nancy Ross hosted a screening of Marianna Brennand’s debut film “Manas” on Saturday in Los Angeles.The film, one of those vying to be the Oscar contender for Brazil, was introduced by Roberts and Penn, who serves as an executive producer.

While the performer broke out as Luke Skywalker in George Lucas' "Star Wars" in 1977, he soon proved that he wasn't only adept at playing wide-eyed, swashbuckling heroes. Hamill's acting career has included live-action TV, a variety of video game roles, and an intimidatingly large amount of voice work for animation. Arguably the most fascinating era of his acting career was during the 1990s, when Hamill got to delve into roles that were nothing like Luke. In addition to playing the Joker on "Batman: The Animated Series" (an iconic role that had been given an unofficial test run...See full article at Slash Film9/14/2025by Bill BriaSlash FilmAfter Star Trek, Gene Roddenberry Made A TV Horror Movie That Should Have Become A FranchiseAfter "Star Trek" was canceled in 1969, show creator Gene Roddenberry went through a prolonged period of struggle. His TV career up to that point had mostly involved writing Westerns and cop shows, usually finding steady gigs as a writer-for-hire. Not only did "Star Trek" change the industry's perception of him — he was now a sci-fi guy — but he was associated with its failure. In 1969, the cult audience for "Star Trek" was still rather small, and fan conventions weren't yet common.Throughout the 1970s, Roddenberry tried, unsuccessfully, to get other major TV and film projects off the ground. In 1971, he wrote the ultra-sexual serial killer thriller "Pretty Maids All in a Row,...See full article at Slash Film9/14/2025by Witney SeiboldSlash FilmShailene Woodley and Ben Foster on Preparing for Their Dialogue-Lite ‘70s Drama ‘Motor City’If you ask Ben Foster, he was born to play the part of a mustachioed, chest hair-baring gangster in the ‘70s set drama “Motor City.”“We had a fabulous wardrobe designer, Amy Roth, who went into the deep trunks but also went to the great designers who did Burt Reynolds and Frank [Sinatra],” Foster told Variety about preparing for the role. “But the truth is, I was in utero, in my mom, in a disco roller-skating rink in Boston. [My parents] didn’t have a car and she would roller skate to work.”“So, that’s how the chest hair came to be,” his co-star Shailene Woodley cracked as their director Potsy Ponciroli chimed in: “We actually designed every piece of his outfit around the chest hair.”Indeed, Foster embraced the retro look so much so that he arrived at the Variety Studio at the Toronto Film Festival sporting an outfit that would...See full article at Variety - Film News9/14/2025by Angelique JacksonVariety - Film News10 Perfect Uses Of Taylor Swift's Music In Movies And TV ShowsIn case you've been off the grid for the past week, you probably already know that Taylor Swift has announced her 12th original album: "The Life of a Showgirl," which will be released on October 3, 2025. With this new record will, in all likelihood, come a whole new slew of bangers that will etch themselves into pop music's history and will likely be immortalized not only through Swift's own legacy but through their use in film and TV.The presence of pop music being used as a "needle drop" in movies and television shows is nothing new.

On the Official Peacemaker Podcast, Gunn revealed that the fixation Vigilante (Freddie Stroma) has on crows is actually his own obsession, and he might be even more obsessed than the show's sweetly twisted antihero/sidekick. In the "Peacemaker" season 2 episode "Another Rick Up My Sleeve," Vigilante asks his hungover friends in the 11th Street Kids if they want to hear some...See full article at Slash Film9/14/2025by Danielle RyanSlash FilmHappy Days' Fonzie Had An Unexpected Scooby-Doo ConnectionGarry Marshall's sitcom "Happy Days" was the ultimate Boomer nostalgia trip. It was set in the suburbs of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in the 1950s, and wistfully followed the wholesome adventures of the teenage Richie Cunningham (Ron Howard), an intelligent and precocious kid who had to traverse the travails of youth, relationships, and family. Marion Ross and Tom Bosley played Richie's parents, while his best friends, Potsie and Ralph Malph, were played by Anson Williams and Donny Most. The show's breakout character, however, was Arthur "The Fonz" Fonzerelli, a friendly, ultra-cool greaser and mechanic played by Henry Winkler. When Ron Howard left the show after its seventh season, Fonzie stayed on as its new protagonist.See full article at Slash Film9/14/2025by Witney SeiboldSlash FilmThe Poignant Stargate Atlantis Episode That Had David Hewlett WorriedThis post contains spoilers for "Stargate Atlantis.""Stargate Atlantis" is chock-full of fantastic episodes, thanks to the Syfy show's tendency to mix incredible character moments with compelling worldbuilding. Over the course of five seasons, "Atlantis" succeeds in becoming a worthwhile continuation of the "Stargate" franchise, expanding the scope of the sci-fi premise that oscillates between playfully campy and genuinely effective elements. The full might of the show's creative process, however, manifests in season finales, and the end of season 4 is no exception, as its 20th episode — titled "The Last Man" — is incredibly hard-hitting. The episode ends with a troubling cliffhanger, but the lead-up to it is both emotional and exciting,...See full article at Slash Film9/14/2025by Debopriyaa DuttaSlash Film‘Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle’ tops North American box office in $70m record anime bowCrunchyroll/Sony’s Demon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba Infinity Castle maintained the welcome September surge in North America, opening top of the charts on an estimated $70m through Columbia Pictures for the biggest ever launch by an anime film.Sony sources said on Sunday morning the three-day haul in 3,315 locations also delivered the highest debut so far this year by a Sony film and any animation, and the highest bow ever by an animated film in September.

Studios are eager to be in business with him, and it certainly helps his cause that he enjoys making commercial films from time to time (as evidenced by his "Equalizer" movies). So, post-stardom, if he regrets making or not making a film, he only has himself to blame.Personally, even though Denzel Washington is my favorite living actor, I do think he's made some mistakes over the years. The formula thriller "The Bone Collector" was limp material that confined him to a bed for most of the movie, while the hospital hostage drama "John Q" was formulaic pap.See full article at Slash Film9/14/2025by Jeremy SmithSlash FilmWhy Superman Was A Villain In Batman: The Dark Knight ReturnsFrank Miller is a living comic book legend. For Batman fans, though, the greatest part of Miller's legacy is always going to be him writing and pencilling "The Dark Knight Returns" in 1986 and then, the following year, writing "Batman: Year One" (drawn by David Mazzucchelli). Both are typically ranked as the two best and most influential Batman comics ever. Yet, they're almost polar opposites."Batman: Year One" is a stripped down crime story, complemented by Mazzucchelli's realistic art. It's appropriately about Bruce Wayne's first year being Batman and so is set in Gotham City before it became a home for costumed criminals. In "Year One," Batman only fights gangsters and Swat teams.See full article at Slash Film9/14/2025by Devin MeenanSlash FilmGlenn Howerton Joined A Star-Studded Cast In This Controversial Horror Movie"The Hunt" was bound to be controversial with its plot about wealthy liberal elites taking revenge on the pro-maga deplorables who perpetuated an internet conspiracy theory that they host elaborate parties where they hunt conservatives for fun.
