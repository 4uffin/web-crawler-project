Movie newsCristin Milioti Won’t Be in ‘The Batman: Part II,’ Matt Reeves SaysMatt Reeves gave an upsetting update on the status of Cristin Milioti’s character from “The Penguin” potentially appearing in “The Batman: Part II.”While talking to MTV on the Emmys red carpet, “The Batman” writer/director revealed that Milioti’s Sofia Falcone will not be in the Caped Crusader sequel opposite Robert Pattinson. She played the character on HBO’s spin-off limited series “The Penguin” — and even won her first-ever Emmy on Sunday.“Cristin’s not in this one,” Reeves said. “But that’s because we were so deep into the script by the time we were in the show, so.

I’m really proud of the script me and Mattson [Tomlin] did, and we’ve started to share it with Robert [Pattinson].”Reeves revealed his excitement for coming back to the gritty world of Gotham and the lengths “The Batman” team had to go to keep the script under wraps. “We put [the script] into a secret pouch that literally has a lock on it with a code.

A lot of that terror comes from having a memorable villain at the core of the story, menacing the main characters and imbuing the narrative with an unsettling energy.

This was the backdrop against which Lizzie Borden set her micro-budget dystopian feminist movie “Born in Flames,” which was released in 1983 after five years of scrappy guerrilla production on the streets of Manhattan.For those who might not have caught “Born in Flames” at a retrospective screening — or for those who saw it back in the ’80s and don’t remember how far ahead of its time it was — the Criterion Collection is releasing the restored film on Blu-Ray Tuesday with a commentary track from the director and cast members, an interview with Borden and as her earlier experimental film “Regrouping.”In the 40-plus years since, “Born in Flames...See full article at Variety - Film News9/15/2025by Pat SapersteinVariety - Film NewsToronto Hit ‘The Condor Daughter,’ a High Andes Drama, Gets a First Trailer From Bendita Film Sales (Exclusive)Arguably the biggest buzz title at Ventana Sur and well received by those who caught it on its Sept. 9 world premiere at last week’s Toronto Festival, Bolivian identity drama “The Condor Daughter” (“La Hija del Condor”) now has a trailer, shared in exclusivity with Variety by the film’s sales agent, Spain’s Bendita Film Sales.Written, directed and produced by Empatia Cinema’s Álvaro Olmos Torrico, a key figure on Bolivia’s cinema scene, “The Condor’s Daughter” was chosen by Variety among 20 International Titles to Track at TIFF.Produced by Empatia Cinema, with Peru’s Ayara Producciones and Uruguay’s Lamayor Cine, “The Condor Daughter” turns on Clara, 16, part of the Totorani Quechua community and her midwife mother Ana’s assistant, living high in the Andes..The trailer takes in many of the key plot beats.

This article contains spoilers for "Foundation" season 3, episode 10, "The Darkness."There were a lot of important locations in "Foundation" season 3 as David S. Goyer's adaptive masterpiece continued to build on its galaxy-spanning story. New Terminus was revealed as the thriving new planetary center of the Foundation. The Mule started his conquest on the pleasure planet of Kalgan. Mycogen held the secret mysteries of Demerzel's (Laura Birn) past (and yeast — lots of yeast). And, of course, the teaser at the end of the finale revealed robots on the Moon next to Earth — a critical connection to the end of the Foundation story.As the season wrapped up, though, there's...See full article at Slash Film9/15/2025by Jaron PakSlash Film5 Reasons Why Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle Ruled The Box OfficeJust about nobody had the weekend of September 12, 2025, circled on their calendar as potentially being a huge frame at the box office. And yet, here we are, staring down the barrel of one of the most unexpectedly robust weekends of the year, led by the record-breaking debut of "Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba — Infinity Castle."The latest big screen entry in the popular anime property finally arrived in North American theaters over the weekend, pulling in an astonishing $70.6 million. Pre-release box office estimates had it pulling in around $50 million which, to be clear, would still have been incredible.

In the cover photo, Carpenter (wearing a small black dress and high-heeled shoes) is posing on her hands and knees in front of an anonymous man. The man's face is out of frame, but his fist is holding a tuft of Carpenter's hair. The image evokes a distinctly sexual vibe, wherein Carpenter is this anonymous man's pet-like plaything; the two are seemingly playing a sub/dom-style sex game. There's nothing explicitly sexual about the image, but it is certainly provocative.The controversy comes from some...See full article at Slash Film9/15/2025by Witney SeiboldSlash FilmThe Emmys Taught Us a Valuable Lesson: Live Awards Shows Need the Support of the Live AudienceThe most frustrating part of this year’s Primetime Emmy Awards was the wasted potential. Multiple records were broken, there were many history-making wins, plus upsets galore, and yet all anyone is talking about is a bit that wore out its welcome the second the Boys & Girls Club charity pot went from six figures to five.Walking into the lobby of the Peacock Theater on a particularly muggy Sunday afternoon, there was actually a lot of enthusiasm for comedian Nate Bargatze’s first stint as host. Not only was he already an Emmy nominee this year for his most recent Netflix comedy special “Your Friend, Nate Bargatze,” but he had also been one of the hosts during the landmark 50th season of “Saturday Night Live.”His opening sketch, a play on “SNL” highlight “Washington’s Dream,” co-starring cast members Bowen Yang, James Austin Johnson, and Mikey Day, worked super-well in the room,...See full article at Indiewire9/15/2025by Marcus JonesIndiewireChanning Tatum Feels Marvel Needs To Do One Thing To Make Gambit SucceedIn Shawn Levy's superhero trifle "Deadpool & Wolverine," the two title heroes (Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman) find themselves in a parallel universe populated only by super-powered castoffs and costumed misfits who don't belong to the same universe as most of the better-known Marvel movie superheroes. The gag of the film, of course, is that most of the outcasts they encounter are unpopular characters culled from the last 20 years of superhero cinema. Chris Evans, for example, plays the Human Torch, a role he originated in 2005's "Fantastic Four." Wesley Snipes similarly returns to the role of Blade (a character he played in the late 1990s and early 2000s), while Jennifer Garner...See full article at Slash Film9/15/2025by Witney SeiboldSlash FilmIsraeli Filmmakers Warn an Industry Boycott Will Hurt ‘Those Who Are Fighting to Tell the Stories of This Conflict’Last week, nearly 4,000 entertainment industry names, including Hollywood stars like Emma Stone and Joaquin Phoenix, signed a petition calling for a boycott of Israeli film institutions “complicit in war crimes” in Gaza. At last night’s Emmy Awards, Javier Bardem called for a “commercial and diplomatic blockade and sanctions on Israel.” Yet, many of the members of the country’s left-leaning film and TV industry are rooting for peace and standing against the Israeli government at their own risk.On Tuesday, the Israeli Academy of Film and Television — which brings together nearly 1,100 filmmakers, producers and actors — is expected to submit “The Sea,” a heart-wrenching drama about a Palestinian boy who risks his life to go to the beach for the first time in Tel Aviv, for the Oscars international feature film race. “The Sea” is one of several fiercely anti-war films shortlisted, alongside Nadav Lapid’s “Yes” and Netalie’s “Oxygen,...See full article at Variety - Film News9/15/2025by Elsa KeslassyVariety - Film NewsReacher Author Lee Child Thinks Alan Ritchson's Hidden Talent Is Perfect For The CharacterJack Reacher actor Alan Ritchson is famous for his brawn, but little do people know he's also got some brains.

While vehicles like Bullitt's Ford Mustang or the rides in the "Fast & Furious" series fit the bill, there is about unattainable fictional cars that put them on another level. In some cases, these fictional cars are characters themselves, displaying a clear sentience to help or hinder the humans. Often impressive technical feats, the best of these cars come to embody their franchises and steal the show whenever they're on-screen.To be clear, for the purposes of this list, a fictional car is something that has...See full article at Slash Film9/15/2025by Samuel StoneSlash FilmBrazil selects ‘The Secret Agent’ as Oscar submissionBrazil’s selection committee has chosen Kleber Mendonça Filho’s The Secret Agent as the country’s Oscar submission in the international feature film category.‘The Secret Agent’ review:The 1977-set thriller about an academic who flees an enemy back to his birthplace in Recife premiered in Cannes.

Much the same tends to hold true when it comes to an entire series, particularly when going from its debut season to the next. The standard has been set, the expectations are higher, and writers somehow have to pull off the impossible. Give viewers more of the same ... but even better than before.
