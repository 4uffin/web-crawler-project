Movie newsStephen Graham Wins First Acting Emmy for ‘Adolescence’With 13 total nominations for its heart-stopping four episodes, Netflix’s smash hit limited series “Adolescence” seemed destined to clean up at this year’s Emmys ceremony. One big question entering Sunday, though, would that love be spread above and below the line?Star and co-creator Stephen Graham might have wondered about the same thing, but with two Emmys, including both his first Emmy win for acting and writing in the bag, he’s got plenty to celebrate.On Sunday evening, Graham first picked up the Emmy Outstanding Writing for a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie (shared with Jack Thorne) and then added to his total tally with his win for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie, beating out other major names like Colin Farrell (“The Penguin”), Jake Gyllenhaal (“Presumed Innocent”), Cooper Coch (“Monster”), and Brian Tyree Henry (“Dope Thief”).Upon hitting the stage for the second time this evening,...See full article at Indiewire9/15/2025by Kate ErblandIndiewireRobert Pattinson Read ‘The Batman 2’ Script From a ‘High-Security’ Locked ‘Pouch’; ‘Penguin’ Season 2 Is ‘In Discussions,’ Matt Reeves SaysAfter nearly four years since “The Batman” became a blockbuster in 2022, the script for “Part II” is finally done and shooting is set to begin early next year.“We start shooting [the film] in spring, probably around the end of April or beginning of May,” director Matt Reeves told Variety‘s Marc Malkin on the Emmys red carpet. “It’s been a long journey, but I am so incredibly excited.

He is a vegetarian by choice—long before it became common; he is the son of a domineering father, and entangled in fragile relationships with women.Kafka is plunged into an existential crisis well before loneliness became a side effect of social media. Misunderstood and full of fears, he escaped into a world of irony, absurdity and imagination, creating works that made him one of the most outstanding writers of the 20th century.German actor Idan Weiss plays Kafka,...See full article at Variety - Film News9/15/2025by Leo BarracloughVariety - Film NewsItaly reveals 24 films in running for Oscar international feature nomination24 Italian films are in the running to represent the country in the Best International Feature Film category in the 98th Academy Awards.Italian film organisation Anica revealed the 24-strong line-up today, ahead of its selection committee meeting to vote and select the film on September 23.The list includes several recent Venice premieres include Pietro Marcello’s stage diva biopic Duse, Leonardo Di Costanzo’s drama Elisa and Gianfranco Rosi’s Below the Clouds, which won the Special Jury Prize.Mario Martone’s literary biopic Fuori, meanwhile, debuted in Competition at Cannes in May.Other films in the running include Candidates...See full article at ScreenDaily9/15/2025ScreenDailyFoundation Season 4: Every Book Storyline That Could Happen NextMajor spoilers ahead for "Foundation" season 3, episode 10, "The Darkness.""Foundation" season 3 is complete.

Graham brought the concept for the series to Thorne as something that could work as a one-take show — something the pair had already worked with “Adolescence” director Philip Barantini on the film “Boiling Point” — and Thorne fleshed out the scripts...See full article at Indiewire9/15/2025by Sarah ShachatIndiewire‘The Late Show with Stephen Colbert’ Wins Emmy for Outstanding Talk SeriesIt only took nine tries and a looming cancelation, but “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” is now the best late-night show on TV, per the Emmys. At Sunday’s Emmy ceremony, the iconic talk show won for Outstanding Talk Series — a category it’s been nominated in nine times and never won. The nightly series bested reigning champion “The Daily Show” (which had won two years in a row) and “Jimmy Kimmel Live!”The latter program actually campaigned for Colbert following CBS’s controversial decision in July to cancel “The Late Show.” Citing a “challenging backdrop” for late-night TV, the powers-that-be axed the 33-year-old television staple in what they called “purely a financial decision.”However, Paramount Global (CBS’s parent company) was trying to close a deal to merge with Skydance at the time, which required approval from the FCC — a government agency controlled by the Trump administration.

There was such a burning life coming into being, and he’s an incredible actor,” Reeves told IndieWire on the red carpet at the Emmys, where he’s nominated for his work on “The Penguin.”The rest is history, and those videos set of a chain of events that led to Farrell’s Penguin getting his own HBO Max series. And in Reeves’s mind, Farrell’s Penguin may not be the only character in Reeves’ Gotham who may be deserving of...See full article at Indiewire9/15/2025by Christian Zilko and Brian WelkIndiewireHannah Einbinder on Pro-Palestine Emmy Acceptance Speech: ‘It’s My Obligation to Distinguish Jews from the State of Israel’When Hannah Einbinder won the Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series, the “Hacks” star ended her speech with a nod to the Philadelphia Eagles and a political rallying cry: “I just want to say Go Birds, fuck Ice, and free Palestine.”Appearing in the winners room alongside her “Hacks” co-star Jean Smart (who picked up a fourth win for Lead Actress in a Comedy Series tonight), Einbinder elaborated on her comments.“I thought it was important to talk about Palestine,” Einbinder said when asked about her support for Palestine and her opposition to Israel’s ongoing response to the October 7th attacks. “It’s an issue that’s very dear to my heart.

While Doherty only appears in one of the four episodes of the Netflix miniseries, it is a marathon two-hander of a story, wherein Ariston assesses teen murderer Jamie Miller’s (Owen Cooper) mental state and awareness of his own guilt.Executive producer, co-writer, and star Stephen Graham charged his collaborator, executive producer and co-writer Jack Thorne, with turning this episode of “Adolescence” into a “Mamet play.” Thorne and then the show’s crew had to figure out a number of structural and logistical hurdles to nail so that the audience is fully immersed in the back and forth between the two characters, sitting at a table across from each other in an empty playroom on a rainy day. But it is squarely on Doherty’s shoulders to guide the...See full article at Indiewire9/15/2025by Sarah ShachatIndiewire‘Severance’ Creator Dan Erickson on Season 3: ‘We Know the End,’ but We’re ‘Playing Jazz a Little Bit’“Severance” has already picked up two Primetime Emmy wins on Sunday night — from stars Britt Lower and Tramell Tillman — but earlier in the evening, creator Dan Erickson spoke to IndieWire about what’s next for the series.“We know the end, and we don’t really know how we’re getting there,” Erickson said on the red carpet. “We have some idea of how we’re getting there, but we definitely like to be open to playing jazz a little bit and changing things as we go along, falling in love with characters that we didn’t necessarily expect to fall in love with, and incorporating them into the story in new ways. I think it is possible to overplan, but we know where we’re going at the end of the day.”So that’s reassuring, at least, that the showrunners know where “Severance” is headed.

Roxana Zal, who won an Emmy in 1984 for the special “Something About Amelia,” remains the youngest winner ever in any category at age 14.But especially notable for Cooper is that his Emmy win came for his first on-screen performance of his career.

This came in the form of Dr. Nathan Riggs, a character played by Martin Henderson during the 12th season of "Grey's Anatomy."
