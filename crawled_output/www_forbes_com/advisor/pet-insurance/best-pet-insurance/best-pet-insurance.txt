A pet medical emergency, such as getting hit by a car, swallowing a foreign object or cancer treatment, can cost thousands of dollars in vet bills. Pet insurance can be a good way to offset those costs.
To help you find the best pet insurance, we analyzed 34 key coverage categories such as the ability to pay your vet directly, availability of a 24/7 pet telehealth line and the option to buy a wellness plan. We also crunched more than 900,000 pet insurance costs for six of the most popular dog breeds.

Our Expert Take
The Pets Best Elite policy is the top-scoring policy in our evaluation. It stands out for its competitive prices and robust coverage, including vet exam fees, dental illnesses, behavioral therapy and alternative therapies. You’ll have access to a 24/7 pet telehealth line and the option to buy one of two different tiers of wellness plans to cover expenses such as annual vet exams, vaccinations, microchipping and neutering/spaying.
Pets Best’s Essential and Plus policies also scored well in our analysis (4.9 stars each). They have differences in coverage and price.

Our Expert Take
Figo stood out in our evaluation due to its solid coverage in the base plan and the options to upgrade your plan via “Powerups.” Figo’s Powerups include hard-to-find coverage for expenses such as advertising and rewards if your pet is lost or stolen and up to $250 in final respects coverage (including burial and cremation expenses). Also included: up to $10,000 in liability coverage if your pet damages someone else’s property, boarding expenses if you are hospitalized and vet exam fees. You’re not likely to find all of this coverage at other top pet insurers.

Our Expert Take
Chewy has partnered with Trupanion and Lemonade to offer pet insurance. Chewy’s plan through Trupanion stands out thanks to its ability to pay a vet directly (if the vet has Trupanion’s software). This makes Chewy’s vet pay system easier to use compared to other insurers that offer ways to pay a vet directly. Options from other pet insurers rely on preapproval from the insurer or the vet waiting for payment.
Our rating is based on Chewy’s Essential Plus policy through Trupanion. You can buy a plan directly from Trupanion, but Chewy’s plan through Trupanion offers different coverage details, cheaper pricing, and it scored higher in our evaluation.

Consumer Sentiment Index
Editor’s note: Chewy doesn’t have enough consumer reviews to rank or rate consumer sentiment adequately. As additional data accumulates, we will include the Consumer Sentiment Index analysis for Chewy in this space.
Pros & Cons
Includes coverage for dental illnesses
Includes 100% coverage for prescription medication and prescription food
Chewy offers two different tiers of wellness plans for expenses such as annual checkups, fecal tests and pet vaccines
No extended waiting period for problems such as hip dysplasia and cruciate ligament issues
Does not include coverage for physical or behavioral therapies, but you can buy coverage for an extra cost (Chewy’s Complete plan does include coverage for behavioral therapy)
Does not include coverage for end-of-life expenses, such as euthanasia or cremation
The policy does not include a 24/7 pet telehealth line, but you’ll have access to free video consults with a vet (included with any Chewy Careplus accident and illness plan)
Customer Satisfaction Survey
Based on our survey of 100 Chewy customers who purchased a policy within a 12-month period from October 11-29, 2023 to October 11-29, 2024:

We like Embrace because it offers a unique way to save on its accident and illness policy with its Healthy Pet Discount Program. If your claim reimbursements are less than $300 per pet in the year prior to the discount period, you’ll qualify for a 5% discount in the first year and 10% in the second year for each pet. Embrace will automatically apply the savings to your annual payment or monthly bill.

Our Analysis of the Best Value in Pet Insurance
Pets Best’s Essential policy offers the most bang for your buck in our analysis of coverage vs. cost. While some policies include more coverage, like Pumpkin and Spot, Pets Best has the highest ratio of coverage compared to cost.
In the graph below, bubbles that float to the top indicate companies with higher costs, and bubbles to the right indicate broader coverage. The Pets Best Essential plan offers the best value in our analysis.
Compare the Best Pet Insurance Companies
With all the variations in pricing and coverage details, it can be challenging to compare pet insurance policies in an apples-to-apples way. We found the best way to do it is by prioritizing the benefits that are the most important to you and then comparing prices among the policies that match your must-haves. Here’s how we chose the best pet insurance.
Plan Type
If you’re shopping for pet insurance, the first thing we recommend looking at is the plan type. We recommend a comprehensive pet insurance policy that covers accidents and illnesses. The three main types of pet insurance can generally be broken down to:
Accident and illness plan. This covers vet bills for accidents (like broken bones) and illnesses (such as cancer, allergies and skin infections).
Accident-only plan. This covers accident-related vet expenses, such as broken bones, bite wounds and ingested foreign objects. It does not cover illness-related vet expenses.
Pet wellness plans for routine care. This is typically an add-on policy that covers routine vet expenses like annual wellness exams, flea and heartworm prevention and vaccinations.
You might also see the term “comprehensive plan” when you’re shopping for pet insurance. This typically refers to an accident and illness policy plus an optional wellness plan. This is sometimes referred to as a “nose to tail” policy.
Related: What Does Pet Insurance Cover?
Compare Plans Available by Company
We recommend looking at valuable benefits like coverage for vet exam fees. Not all insurers include this with their base policies. If having access to a 24/7 vet telehealth line is important to you, we recommend choosing an insurer that provides this benefit. It’s also a good idea to look at insurers that offer optional pet insurance wellness plans for routine care if you want coverage for expenses like annual wellness exams and vaccinations.

Coverage Levels
Pet insurance policies will typically offer a range of annual maximums, deductibles and reimbursement levels to choose from. We would prioritize choosing coverage levels you’re comfortable with rather than focusing on price alone. In the event of an expensive claim, you’ll be glad you bought sufficient coverage.
Annual maximum coverage. This is the maximum amount that will be paid out for pet insurance claims during the policy period. Common annual maximum coverage amounts include $5,000, $10,000 and unlimited.
Deductible. This is the amount you’ll pay toward vet bills before your coverage kicks in. Common deductible choices include $100, $250 and $500.
Reimbursement percentage. This is the reimbursement you’ll get back if you make a pet insurance claim. Common reimbursement levels include 70%, 80% and 90%.
Compare What’s Covered by Company
We recommend comparing coverage benefits like behavioral therapy, alternative therapy, microchipping and end-of-life expenses among pet insurers. Some insurers include these coverage types in their base policies or have the option to buy extra coverage.

Waiting Periods
A waiting period is the time between the policy purchase date and when the coverage begins. If you have a dog, we recommend taking a hard look at any special waiting periods, such as those for cruciate ligament issues. Many policies have a six-month waiting period for this, but some insurers will waive this waiting period if you have an orthopedic exam done.
Special waiting periods for orthopedic conditions like hip dysplasia or cruciate ligament issues can range from six to 12 months, but you can find pet insurance with no waiting period for orthopedic conditions. If a long waiting period is a concern, I recommend looking at insurers like ASPCA, Pumpkin, Spot and Trupanion.

Other Pet Insurance Comparison Factors
Here are two more factors we would look at when buying a pet insurance policy:
Exam fees. When you take your pet to the veterinarian for an accident or illness, you pay an exam fee, which typically costs $100 or more, depending on your veterinarian and visit type. Make sure the policy covers these exam fees because not all do.
Benefits. Look for extra benefits like a 24-hour vet helpline in case your pet gets sick outside of veterinarian operating hours. As another example, Nationwide pet insurance members have access to preferred pricing on pet prescriptions at any Walmart pharmacy.
How Much Does Pet Insurance Cost?
Pet insurance costs an average of $46 per month for a dog and $23 per month for a cat, according to our analysis of pet insurance costs. That’s for a policy with $5,000 of annual coverage, a $250 deductible and 80% reimbursement level. A policy with unlimited annual coverage, a $250 deductible and 80% reimbursement level costs an average of $66 per month for a dog and $34 per month for a cat.
Your pet insurance costs will depend on factors such as your pet’s breed, age and the veterinary costs in your area.

Pet Insurance Discounts
The most common pet insurance discount is a multi-pet insurance discount, which ranges between 5% to 10% if you insure more than one dog or cat with the same pet insurer. Other discounts to look for include spay/neuter discounts, military discounts, annual pay discounts and a bundling discount if you bundle your pet policy with other types of policies, such as auto, home or renters insurance.
Pro Tip
Some employers offer pet insurance as a voluntary benefit, which could get you a 5% to 10% discount.
How to Choose the Right Pet Insurance
These simple steps will get you to the best policy for your situation.
Consider Your Pet’s Potential Health Problems
Your pet’s age, breed and health history can affect what kind of coverage you want. Consult with your vet about your pet’s susceptibility to certain illnesses or injuries common to the breed. Also, consider the pet’s risk of injury if they spend a lot of time outdoors.
Determine What Policy Features Are Important to You
Consider what types of health issues should be covered by your ideal policy, especially when it comes to potentially pricey problems. For example, if you want coverage for serious illnesses such as cancer, make sure you buy an accident and illness policy rather than an accident-only policy.
It’s also a smart idea to look for coverage perks like a 24/7 pet telehealth line, coverage for vet exam fees and the option to add a wellness plan.
Consider the Waiting Periods
Pet insurance waiting periods are generally two to 14 days for accident coverage and 14 days for illness coverage. Some pet insurers have special waiting periods for orthopedic conditions (such as cruciate ligament issues) that can range from six to 12 months. You can find pet insurance with no special waiting periods, such as ASPCA pet health insurance.
Choose Reimbursement Levels
Your coverage levels will impact your pet insurance cost. If you want to pay less out of pocket, choose a lower deductible and a higher reimbursement amount, but it’ll cost you more in premiums because your insurer will pay out more if you file a pet insurance claim.
Check Your Pet’s Eligibility
Some pet insurers have age limits to buy a policy. Most insurers will insure puppies and kittens around the age of six to 10 weeks. But some insurers have upper age limits (such as age 14) to buy a policy. The best pet insurance companies for older dogs do not have upper age limits and have convenient coverage perks like a 24/7 pet telehealth line and the option to add a wellness plan.
Compare Quotes for Plans That Match Your Wish List
The best way to find a policy within your budget is to compare pet insurance quotes from multiple insurers. Make sure to compare quotes for various levels of annual coverage. In some cases you can pay a little more per month for a lot more coverage. For example, unlimited annual coverage from Pets Best is only about $6 more per month than its $5,000 limit plan. This is a bargain compared to other pet insurers, where the monthly price difference can be more like $30 and up.
Anticipated Pet Medical Bills Among Popular Dog Breeds
Among popular dog breeds, poodles and dachshunds are the most likely to develop health problems as adult dogs. But based on data from Fetch, rottweilers have the most expensive cost of care as adult dogs.

We found that 86% of survey respondents said that they were satisfied with customer service and pricing, while 89% said they were likely to recommend their pet insurance company to friends and family.
We also surveyed 1,300 American pet owners who filed a pet insurance claim in the last twelve months.

Methodology
To find the best pet insurance, we collected data and scored each pet insurance company across several categories. Only pet insurers offering annual maximum coverage of $100,000 or unlimited were scored so that comparisons were fair among companies. If a company has more than one top-scoring policy, we show only the policy with the highest score.
Pet insurance rates for mixed breed dogs (20% of score): We calculated average rates for medium-sized mixed breed dogs ages 3 months, 2 years, 5 years and 7 years for plans with unlimited coverage, a $250 deductible and 80% reimbursement level, or the closest options available.
Pet insurance rates for purebred dogs (20% of score): We calculated average rates for French bulldogs, German shepherds, golden retrievers, labrador retrievers and poodles ages 3 months and 3 years for plans with unlimited coverage, a $250 deductible and 80% reimbursement level, or the closest options available.
Direct payment to vet (10% of score): Pet insurance companies that have the ability to pay a vet directly earned points. In order to receive points, this feature must be stated on the pet insurer’s website.
Special waiting period (5% of score): Many pet insurance companies have a special waiting period for problems such as cruciate ligament issues and hip dysplasia. Plans that have no special waiting period, a waiting period of fewer than six months or the ability to have the waiting period waived scored higher. In certain states, waiting periods are dictated by state law and may vary.
24/7 vet telehealth line (5% of score): Insurers that provide access to a 24/7 vet telehealth line earned points.
Routine wellness plans (5% of score): Insurers that offer optional wellness plans earned points.
Multi-pet discount (5% of score): Many pet insurance companies offer a discount if you insure more than one pet. Insurers that offer a multi-pet discount earned points.
Digital experience (5% of score): We evaluated pet insurers on mobile app ratings for both Android and Apple, if there’s a useful website search function and if there’s a live chat that provides helpful information.
Behavioral therapy (2% of score): Insurers that cover behavioral therapy in their base policies earned points.
Alternative therapy (2% of score): Insurers that include alternative therapies such as acupuncture, chiropractic care and hydrotherapy in their base policies earned points.
Dental illness (2% of score): Insurers that include coverage for dental illnesses, such as gingivitis and periodontal disease, earned points.
Pays veterinary exam fees (1% of score): Policies that cover the vet exam fee received points. Not all insurers cover exam fees, even if the fee is for an illness or accident-related visit that’s covered by insurance.

Best Pet Insurance Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
Is pet insurance worth it?
We found the best way to determine if pet insurance is worth it is to consider how an unexpected vet bill could impact your personal finances. For example, if you’ve been paying about $50 per month for pet insurance for three years, you’ve paid $1,800 in pet insurance premiums.
Let’s say your dog swallowed a tennis ball and surgery cost $3,500. If you have a $250 deductible and 80% reimbursement level, your out-of-pocket cost for treatment would be $900 ($250 deductible + 20% of $3,250 = $900). Adding up the premium for three years and what you’ve paid toward treatment, you’ve paid $2,700 and avoided paying $800 by having pet insurance.
What is the best dog insurance?
We found that Pets Best pet insurance is the best dog insurance company among the companies we evaluated because of its solid coverage options and low prices for unlimited annual coverage. Dog owners will find a 24/7 vet telehealth line, the option to add a wellness plan and the ability to pay the vet directly, which can help keep out-of-pocket expenses low.
Other pet insurance companies that scored well in our analysis were Chewy, Figo, Spot, Embrace and Healthy Paws.
What is the best cat insurance?
We found that Pets Best is the best cat insurance due to its competitive prices and coverage options. These include access to a 24/7 vet telehealth line, an optional wellness plan and the ability to pay the vet directly.
Other insurers that were among our winners for best cat insurance companies include Embrace, Spot, Figo and Healthy Paws.
Do all vets take pet insurance?
All vets take pet insurance in the sense that pet insurance is generally reimbursement-based, meaning you’ll pay the veterinarian bills up-front and then submit a claim to your pet insurance company for reimbursement. So in most cases, the veterinarian does not interact at all with the insurance company.
Some pet insurance companies pay the vet directly, which can reduce your out-of-pocket costs and you won’t have to wait for an insurance claims check.
What is the best level of pet insurance?
The best level of pet insurance is an accident and illness plan with an added pet wellness plan for routine care. This combination covers the most types of problems, such as major illnesses like cancer, accidents such as ingesting foreign objects, and routine vet expenses like annual exams and vaccinations. This combination is sometimes referred to as a comprehensive plan or a “nose to tail” plan.
