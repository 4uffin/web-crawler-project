Your death can cause your loved ones much more than emotional heartache; it can also cause financial hardship. That is, if you don’t have life insurance. The right life insurance policy, with the right amount of coverage, means your family remains financially secure after you’re gone. And depending on the type of policy, it may also mean cash value to take advantage of while you’re still here.
To help you find the best life insurance, we analyzed 15 insurance companies for the key metrics that matter most, like financial strength, term rates, cost competitiveness, cash value performance and more.

Our Expert Take
Pacific Life’s life insurance earned top marks in our analysis. We found that it has highly reliable illustrations. We also like that most of its policies build cash value relatively quickly.
For term life buyers, Pacific Life’s PL Promise Term policy offers low rates compared to competitors.
“Pacific Life has a long history of offering products with low costs and competitive investment options. However, the costs of some newer products can be higher, and some newer investment options have been underperforming expectations. As such, be sure to ask your financial advisor 1) whether internal policy costs are higher or lower than industry benchmarks, and 2) for the actual track record of recommended investment options,” advises Barry D. Flagg, founder of Veralytic and a Forbes Advisor board member.

Our Expert Take
Protective’s indexed universal life insurance policies earned top marks in our analysis. We found that these policies are highly cost-competitive (including internal charges), and we’re impressed by the stellar historical investment performance underlying Protective’s indexed universal life policies. Strong investment performance helps keep policy costs low and fuels better cash value.
We also appreciate the low term life rates offered by Protective’s Classic Choice Term. It offers hard-to-find 35- and 40-year term options.
Forbes Advisor board member Barry D. Flagg warns that IUL promoters often (i.e., more than for any other product type) quote low premiums or project high account growth, giving the appearance of low costs while instead actually charging high costs with high risks of underperformance. On the other hand, Protectives IUL products are generally priced competitively and quoted based on reasonable performance expectations. The policies are also supported by generally superior performance of invested assets underlying policy account values, says Flagg.

Protective Life is a strong option for term life insurance, particularly noted by healthy life insurance buyers for its competitive pricing and favorable underwriting. However, multiple users are reporting issues and dissatisfaction with their customer service and claims process, which raises significant concerns about its overall performance.
Pros & Cons
Choice of up to 7 cash value policies if you convert a Protective term life policy.
Superior historical performance of company investments helps keep premiums low.
Toll-free number is helpful for shoppers who are seeking quotes, need help applying or have policy questions.
Cash value accumulation may be moderately slow in the early years of a policy.
Policy-specific details are not easy to find on the company’s website, which can make shopping difficult.

Our Expert Take
One of the reasons Prudential earned a top spot in our rankings was its highly reliable policy illustrations compared to the competitors we analyzed. This is especially important because whether you’re a young buyer who will likely hold a policy for many years or an older buyer who may not have the policy as long, having reliable expectations of funding requirements and cash value growth can help you develop a better financial plan.
Forbes Advisor board member Barry D. Flagg, founder of Veralytic, notes that regulations in many states permit insurers to quote low premiums or project high account growth, giving the appearance of low costs while instead actually charging high costs with high risks of underperformance. However, Prudential earns high ratings from Veralytic for more dependable premium quotes and more reliable illustrations of cash value growth, in addition to high ratings for competitive internal policy costs and financial strength.
Prudential’s Term Essential policy doesn’t offer as many term length options as other top companies (only 10-, 15-, 20- and 30-year), but its term life rates are competitive.

Customers enjoy Prudential’s financial stability and vast policy options. While some report appreciating competitive rates and underwriting leniency, others are disappointed in claim denials and delays, poor communication and a lack of responsiveness.
Pros & Cons
Solid and reliable financial strength.
Cash value policy costs are low compared to most competitors.
Important policy-specific details are available on the Prudential website.
Not all of Prudential’s permanent policies build cash value well early on in the policy.
The historical performance of the company’s investments have been poor, which can impact the cash value growth of some policies.
Customer service number targets existing customers, which is not helpful to non-customers with policy questions.

Our Expert Take
We like Lincoln Financial for its reliable policy illustrations for people considering a variable universal life policy. These illustrations give a view of potential future growth and costs within a policy, which gives you some help in financial planning.
Term rates are competitive for Lincoln Financial’s TermAccel policy, but the maximum issue age of 60 is lower than most other top companies. Term lengths are also limited to four options (10-, 15-, 20- and 30-year), compared to most other top companies in our analysis.
Barry D. Flagg, Forbes Advisor board member, also observes that “Lincoln Financial offers a number of joint life products [also called survivorship life insurance] that are among the lowest in cost, among the most stable in pricing, and that have a wide spectrum of different investment options and risk profiles for estate plans with different risk tolerances.”

Our Expert Take
Nationwide stood out in our analysis for its reliable policy illustrations. This is especially important for young buyers who will likely be holding a policy for many decades and who want a reliable prediction of cash value.
Barry D. Flagg, Forbes Advisor board member, says, “Nationwide products can be great for young adults, given its history of low and stable costs. Young adults can also benefit from Nationwide’s wide selection of investment options, covering almost every different asset class from equities to fixed income, large cap to small cap, growth to value, domestic to foreign, etc.”
Nationwide’s internal costs for cash value policies are not the lowest in our analysis, but they are still moderately low. Flagg cautions that restrictions on accessing cash value (or surrender charges) can be higher in Nationwide products, but such restrictions can encourage long-term growth of cash value.
In addition, Nationwide recently introduced a new fee-based product with no such restrictions on access to policy account values. Such fee-based products are designed to compensate CFPs and other financial planners for ongoing monitoring and planning beyond just placement of the policy, which can be particularly important for young adults often with less financial experience and therefore needing more financial guidance.
Nationwide’s Guaranteed Level term life policy rates are low, though term length options are more limited (10-, 15-, 20- and 30-year) than those of some other top companies.

Our Expert Take
Mutual of Omaha stands out from competitors in our analysis thanks to its excellent historical investment performance, which means the potential for strong cash value growth. We also like its low internal policy costs for cash value policies.
Rates for Mutual of Omaha’s term life insurance policy, Term Life Answers, are average, but it shares many of the same features as other top companies, such as high coverage amounts, accelerated death benefits, renewability and the option to convert to a permanent policy.
Veralytic founder and Forbes Advisor board member Barry D. Flagg says, “Mutual of Omaha consistently receives high-marks for performance of their general account portfolio of high-grade bonds and government backed mortgages. Performance of the general account drives performance of universal life (UL) crediting rates, whole life (WL) dividend interest rates and even the amount of the “options budget” critical to performance of indexed universal life (IUL) type products. Mutual of Omaha is also highly-rated for financial strength and claims-paying ability and competitiveness of internal policy costs.

Our Expert Take
Penn Mutual’s universal life (UL) insurance policies offer a great combination of financial strength, competitive internal policy costs and superior historical investment performance. We think buyers will like the ability to maximize their death benefits for the premiums paid for the UL policies.
We are also impressed by Penn Mutual’s low rates for its non-convertible term life policy, although rates are much higher for its convertible option. In contrast to most other top companies, we noticed that no accelerated death benefit is mentioned for its non-convertible term policy.
Forbes Advisor board member Barry D. Flagg observes that “Penn Mutual is one of the highest-rated insurers for financial strength and claims-paying ability. It offers universal life products with broadly competitive internal policy costs across most ages, health risk classes and face amounts. Penn Mutual also offers generally reliable quotes and policy illustrations, good access to cash value in some of its products and superior historical performance of invested assets underlying policy account values.”

Establish your financial goals
Once you know your goals, then find the policy that’s right for you. An experienced life insurance agent can help you find the right company and policy. Insurance companies vary in their underwriting criteria and pricing, so while one company can be good for one person, another company might be better for you.
Tony Steuer
Advisory Board Member
Check financial strength ratings
I always make sure the companies I’m considering have an A rating or higher for financial strength. These ratings are available from agencies like AM Best and Standard & Poor’s and help me identify companies that will be able to pay claims many years in the future. That’s why all the companies in our analysis are rated A or higher.
Ashlee Valentine
Insurance Editor
Work with experienced professionals
I’ve found it’s essential to work with an experienced life insurance agent or financial advisor who knows which insurers are most likely to give the best price based on age and health. You want to know if you have a good chance of getting a decent quote from an insurer before you apply. A good life insurance agent or financial advisor can also anonymously shop around for you, so you don’t get declined—which can affect your ability to buy life insurance later from someone else.

Methodology
To find the best life insurance companies, we evaluated term life and permanent life insurance for each company. We used our own research and data courtesy of Veralytic, a leading publisher of life insurance product research. Veralytic’s data provides a unique depth to Forbes Advisor’s analysis of whole, universal, indexed universal and variable universal life insurance policies from each insurer.
While independent research is commonplace for most every other element of our financial lives, life insurance product recommendations are too often based on hypothetical quotes or illustrations. What you pay in premiums and what you get in cash value and death benefits depends on what the insurance company actually charges and what you actually receive in performance over time. As such, Veralytic measures the competitiveness of internal policy costs and actual historical performance. Veralytic reports are available through financial advisors.
Our analysis was based on the following.
Term life insurance rates (30% of score): Because price is the primary concern of many term life insurance shoppers, we gave more weight to this category. We scored costs based on each company’s rates for 30- and 40-year-old men and women for 10, 20 and 30 terms and for coverage amounts of $250,000, $500,000, $1 million and $2 million. Source: Forbes Advisor research.
Complaints (10% of score): A low complaint level can indicate satisfied customers. Companies with a higher than average complaint index were eliminated. Source: National Association of Insurance Commissioners.
Term life guaranteed renewability (5% of score): Companies earned points if their term life policies can be renewed at the end of the level term period. Source: Forbes Advisor research.
Term life conversion (5% of score): Companies earned points if their term life policies can be converted to permanent life insurance. Source: Forbes Advisor research.
Financial strength (10% of score): This measure incorporates the insurer’s financial strength ratings from four major ratings agencies: AM Best, Fitch, Moody’s and Standard and Poor’s. Financial strength is particularly important when you’re relying on a company’s ability to pay claims many decades from now. Source: Veralytic.
Cost competitiveness of cash value policies (10% of score): This measures the level of premiums and internal policy charges, including the cost of insurance, fixed administration expenses and cash value-based wrap fees. Note that every life insurance product charges different prices based on age, gender, health profile and policy face amounts. No insurer will be the most price-competitive for all possible buyers. Source: Veralytic.
Reliability of policy illustrations (10% of score): This factor measures the reliability over time of the company’s illustrations for its permanent life insurance products. When you plan to be holding on to a policy for decades and counting on cash value to accumulate, you want an illustration that’s accurate. Source: Veralytic.
Historical performance of investments (10% of score): This measures whether the historical performance of the company’s investments that fuel cash value growth is superior to other companies’ comparable products. Source: Veralytic.
Access to cash value (10% of score): This measure evaluates the liquidity of cash value and a policyholder’s access to it. Some policies will build cash value better in the early years, and with other companies you may be waiting several years before you have meaningful cash value within a policy. Generally speaking, the higher the liquidity, particularly in early policy years, the better—but some insurers charge more for greater liquidity, so consider the possible tradeoff. Source: Veralytic.

Best Life Insurance Companies Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
What does life insurance cover?
Life insurance covers the life of the insured person. If you pass away with an in-force life insurance policy, the beneficiaries specified on the policy will receive the death benefit. Beneficiaries can use that payout in any way they choose.
What does life insurance exclude?
Life insurance policies typically include a suicide clause. This clause specifies that suicide within the first two years of the policy will not be covered.
Apart from the suicide clause, life insurance policies pay the death benefit no matter the cause of death unless the insurer can prove misrepresentation or the policyholder stops paying premiums. An insurer may deny a life insurance claim if it discovers something like a known health issue that was not disclosed in the application. It could also deny a payout if the policy had lapsed due to nonpayment.
Can I buy life insurance on someone else?
Yes, you can purchase life insurance on someone else as long as you can prove an “insurable interest” in that person. An insurable interest means that you would financially suffer if they died. The person being insured must sign the application. You cannot purchase a policy on someone without their knowledge.
If you buy life insurance on someone else, you can make yourself the life insurance beneficiary.
Can I use my life insurance while still living?
If you have a cash value life insurance policy, there are ways to use your life insurance while still living. You can access the cash value through loans, withdrawals or by surrendering the policy.
Another way to use your life insurance while still living is through living benefits if your policy includes them. Living benefits allow you to access money from your own death benefit if you meet specific health requirements. This could include people who are diagnosed with a terminal, chronic or critical illness.
If you’re buying life insurance, find out what living benefits can be included in the policy.
