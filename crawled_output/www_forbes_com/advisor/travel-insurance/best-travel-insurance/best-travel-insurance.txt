Customers are happy with IMG’s coverage options and pricing, but the company is not without its drawbacks. Some report dissatisfaction with the claims process, citing delays and poor communication.
Pros & Cons
Offers “cancel for any reason” and “interruption for any reason” upgrades with 75% reimbursement of insured trip cost
Cancellation and interruption benefits cover sickness, injury or death of a dog or cat, and include $500 in kennel benefits
It includes a “hospital of choice” option for continuing care after you’ve been transported to the nearest adequate treatment center
Missed connection benefits of $500 are low compared to some competitors with $1,000 and higher
If you want CFAR or IFAR coverage you must buy it when you purchase the policy, compared to competitors that typically allow 14 to 21 days from your first trip deposit
Baggage delay waiting period of 12 hours is good, but some competitors have a six-hour delay
BEST FOR CRUISES
Nationwide Travel Insurance: Cruise Luxury
4.9

Our Expert Take
We like Nationwide’s Cruise Luxury policy for its cruise-specific advantages. It includes $1,000 in itinerary change benefits for prepaid excursions you miss if a cruise changes course. It also has a $250 inconvenience benefit for delays caused by a fire or mechanical breakdown.
Its evacuation benefits are superior, with $1 million for medical evacuations and $25,000 for nonmedical evacuations per person. Missed connection benefits of $2,500 are also outstanding.
This policy’s average cost was the fourth-lowest among the top 10 policies in our analysis.
Note that you do not have to be going on a cruise to take advantage of this policy’s robust coverage.

Customers find that buying travel insurance from Nationwide is easy and they are happy with their coverage. However, some aren’t happy with the claims process, citing delays in processing claims and poor customer service when filing claims.
Pros & Cons
Offers a “cancel for any reason” (CFAR) upgrade with reimbursement of 75% and an “interruption for any reason” (IFAR) upgrade that provides up to $1,000 per person
Good baggage delay of $1,000 with a short six-hour delay period
Excellent baggage insurance of $2,500 per person
Travel delay coverage of $1,000 is a bit low compared to some competitors with $2,000 to $3,000
Long 24-hour delay required for inclement weather coverage, compared to some competitors with only a 12-hour delay requirement
Medical expense coverage of $250,000 is great but some top-rated policies have $500,000

Customers praise WorldTrips for its policy offerings, which include lots of optional upgrades. They also especially like the option to buy short-term coverage, or a policy that goes into effect after you depart. However, some feel the claims process is challenging and note poor customer service experiences.
Pros & Cons
You can add an “interruption for any reason” upgrade with 150% reimbursement and a “cancel for any reason” upgrade with either 50% or 75% reimbursement
Decent missed connection coverage of $1,500 per person
Upgrades are available for adventure sports, rental car coverage and pet medical and kennel expenses
Waiting period for baggage delay coverage is long at 12 hours, compared to some competitors with 6 hours
Solid travel healthcare insurance benefits of $250,000 per person, though some competitors offer higher limits of $500,000 per person

Our Expert Take
One of the reasons we like Seven Corners’s Cruise Insurance policy is its short waiting period of six hours for travel and baggage delays—many competitors have 12 hours or longer.
We also like that it includes a $500 per person benefit if your cruise is diverted or disabled. Additionally, it provides $500 per person for itinerary changes that force you to miss prepaid activities or that eliminate a destination from the itinerary.
One drawback is that the Cruise Insurance plan’s average cost is only so-so—the fourth-highest cheapest out of the 10 top policies in our rankings.
Note that you do not have to be going on a cruise to take advantage of this policy’s coverage.

Excellent missed connection benefits of $1,500
Provides decent baggage insurance of $2,000 per person
Inclement weather coverage requires a 48-hour delay, compared to some competitors that require only 12 hours.

Starr’s Premier policy stands out in our evaluation for its generous baggage insurance of $2,500. It also provides great coverage of $500 for baggage delays after a 12-hour delay, which is half the time of some competitors.
Other notable features include good travel delay benefits of $1,500 with a short waiting period of six hours. We also like that “cancel for any reason” coverage is available as an upgrade.
Starr Premier’s average cost is the second-highest among the 10 top-rated policies in our rankings.

Generali’s Premium policy stood out in our analysis for its generous window for getting preexisting medical condition coverage. Travelers with preexisting conditions can get coverage as long as you buy a Premium policy up to or within 24 hours of your final trip deposit. Competitors often have a deadline of 10 to 20 days after making a first trip deposit. We also like that it has the second-lowest average cost among the 10 top-rated policies we evaluated.
The policy has a short six-hour waiting period for travel delay coverage and $500 per person for baggage delays after 12 hours.

HTH Worldwide’s TripProtector Preferred policy is worth a look if you’re worried about disruptions once your trip has started. The policy has superior trip interruption benefits of 200% of the trip cost—most competitors provide 150%. Travel delay benefits are outstanding at $2,000 per person, with a short six-hour waiting period. Missed connection coverage is decent at $1,000 per person after a three-hour delay.
However, the TripProtector Preferred policy’s average cost was the third most expensive among the top 10 policies in our rankings.

Customers praise HTH for its pricing and choice of coverage options. One feature they especially like is the ability to have medical expenses paid directly to the provider. Still, some find the claims process challenging and are unsatisfied with customer service.
Pros & Cons
Superior travel medical coverage of $500,000 and medical evacuation coverage of $1 million
Offers CFAR upgrade with 75% reimbursement of insured trip cost

One reason to like PrimeCover’s Luxe policy is its superior medical evacuation coverage of up to $1 million per person. The Luxe policy also has a “hospital of choice” feature, allowing you to be transported to your preferred treatment facility after initial care at the nearest adequate medical center. Nonmedical evacuation benefits of $100,000 per person are also included.
The policy also excels in trip interruption coverage, reimbursing up to 200% of the trip cost, surpassing the 150% offered by many competitors. We also like that you can buy a “cancel for any reason” (CFAR) upgrade with 75% reimbursement.
And it all comes at a good price: The Luxe policy’s average cost ranks fifth lowest among the top 10 policies in our rankings.

Our Expert Take
Travelex’s Ultimate policy stood out in our analysis thanks to its impressive array of add-on options. Adventure travelers can buy add-on benefits for activities usually excluded from coverage. Adventurers will also appreciate the $100,000 in security evacuation and $10,000 in search and rescue benefits.
Add-on coverage for pets is also available, providing $250 for boarding fees if your return is delayed and $2,500 for vet expenses if your dog or cat becomes sick or injured during the trip. Other upgrades you can opt for: rental property security deposit reimbursement,  “cancel for business reasons”, CFAR and rental car coverage.
The policy includes $2,000 in baggage insurance per person and you can choose to increase these limits by $3,000 to $5,000. If you opt for that, the upgrade also adds coverage for sporting equipment rental ($2,000), sporting equipment delay ($1,500) and electronic or business equipment ($2,000).
The Ultimate’s average cost ranks as the third-cheapest among the top 10 policies in our rankings.

What Affects Travel Insurance Costs?
Unlike many other types of insurance, there are usually only a few factors that go into travel insurance pricing.
Trip cost: The more trip costs you insure, the higher your travel insurance cost. Your trip cost includes any prepaid, nonrefundable expenses, such as airfare, hotel accommodations, tours, event tickets, excursions and theme park passes. If you’re taking a global trip compared to general travel in a neighboring country, the trip and travel insurance costs will be higher.
Your age: The traveler’s age is also taken into account in travel insurance pricing. That’s because older travelers tend to have a higher likelihood of filing medical claims.
Coverage: The more travel insurance coverage you buy, the more you’ll pay.
For instance, if you opt for a “cancel for any reason” upgrade, generous travel medical expense coverage and high limits for travel protection that covers delays and baggage, you’ll pay more for your vacation insurance.

Begin Shopping Right After Your First Trip Deposit
It’s recommended to purchase holiday insurance immediately after you make your first trip deposit. That way, you get the maximum length of time for cancellation coverage. Plus, you’ll qualify for time-sensitive benefits, such as CFAR and preexisting medical condition exclusion waivers.

Start by Estimating the Nonrefundable Trip Cost
The nonrefundable trip cost is the amount you want to insure for trip cancellation. If you’re unsure of what the total cost will be, estimate the amount and then update it later with the travel insurance company, as long as you do so before your departure date.

Buy Travel Medical Insurance for International Trips
If you’re traveling outside the U.S., make sure you buy a reputable policy with ample medical travel insurance and emergency medical evacuation insurance. It’s important because you may have little to no coverage under your U.S. health plan for foreign travel health insurance. Look for a policy where the medical insurance is primary, meaning the policy will pay out first, before any other health insurance you have. Our highest-rated travel insurance policies have at least $250,000 in travel accident insurance.

Check for Delay and Missed Connection Coverage
If you’re flying to your destination, your itinerary could be derailed by weather, airplane mechanical issues or missed connections. If you’re worried about paying extra money due to a delay or missed connections, look for a policy that has a generous amount of travel and baggage delay coverage and missed connection insurance. You’ll also want to find a policy with a short waiting period for delay coverage, such as six hours.

Decide How Much Cancellation Flexibility You Want
If you have a lot of nonrefundable expenses and can’t afford to lose your trip investment, consider buying a “cancel for any reason” upgrade. You never know what life will bring, and unfortunately it might bring a reason to cancel a trip that’s not covered by the base policy of a general travel insurance plan. Having reliable CFAR coverage ensures you can get partial reimbursement for any oddball problems that crop up.

Best Travel Insurance Companies Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
What is “hospital of choice” and how do I get it?
Having a “hospital of choice” feature in your travel insurance policy means the policy will pay for you to be transported to the treatment facility of your choice after initial care at the nearest adequate medical center. It is included in top-rated policies such as IMG’s iTravelInsured Travel LX, WorldTrips’ Atlas Journey Elevate and PrimeCover’s Luxe. Some policies offer it as an upgrade that you can purchase, such as Travelex’s Ultimate policy.
How can I get cheap travel insurance?
You can get inexpensive travel insurance by assessing the type and amount of coverage you need as well as your trip cost. Start by insuring only nonrefundable trip costs. You can’t make a travel insurance claim for costs you can get refunded. So, if your plane tickets are refundable, you wouldn’t include that in your trip cost.
If you’re not traveling outside of the U.S. to go overseas, you probably don’t need high travel health insurance limits, which can also keep costs affordable. You also want to be sure you don’t buy unnecessary coverage. For example, if your main concern is covered by standard trip cancellation, such as canceling due to an illness, you can be covered without spending extra money on a CFAR upgrade. Another example: you don’t need baggage insurance of $2,000 if you’re packing $300 worth of T-shirts, shorts and a swimsuit for a weekend getaway.
Where can I buy travel insurance online?
When looking for a place to buy general travel or business travel insurance, you can go online to company websites or aggregator sites that allow you to compare travel insurance plans from different insurance providers. You’ll be able to search for medical travel insurance, overseas travel insurance, domestic travel insurance, short term medical insurance for international travel, multi-trip and single-trip travel insurance, and more.
The information you need to buy reliable travel insurance includes the trip cost being insured, your age, your destination, length of trip and age. Buying travel insurance online is relatively easy. You don’t have to answer a lot of questions, and you can update your trip cost and itinerary later if plans change, as long as you do so before your departure.
