Project management software makes the lives of project managers, Scrum Masters and business owners easier. Its ability to help plan, organize and track tasks, monitor finances and resources, and help cross-functional teams collaborate cannot be overstated. The problem is, with so many project management platforms available, how do you pick the right one for your SMB? The best place to start is right here with this list of the best project management software.
The Forbes Advisor data research team and I analyzed 26 project management platforms. We studied 61 features of each and narrowed our list to the top 10 providers. I then completed hands-on testing of each platform before awarding final scores. My testing shows that ClickUp is the best platform for most teams thanks to its excellent free plan, affordable paid plans and robust tools. However, nine other platforms put up strong fights. Read on to learn more.

Expert Take
I have been using and reviewing project management software for many years, and I can honestly say that ClickUp is the best platform for most SMBs due to its versatility. No matter whether you use traditional project management methodologies, such as Critical Path, or Agile frameworks, such as Scrum and Kanban, ClickUp offers all the tools you need. You’ll find customizable Kanban boards, calendars, Gantt charts and lists to plan and track project tasks. There’s also a good mix of reports and time, budgeting and resource management tools.
ClickUp’s Kanban boards are easy to use and customize.
ClickUp is ideal for distributed teams, as it offers a robust suite of collaborative tools that include real-time documents, mind maps, whiteboards and an instant messenger. You can also integrate many third-party applications and configure automations to save time. ClickUp offers a free plan that supports unlimited users and multiple tools, and its paid plans are affordable. Plans cost between $10 and $19 per user per month (billed monthly). For large teams, there’s an Enterprise plan with many advanced features, though you must call for a quote.

ClickUp is generally well-regarded for its flexibility and wide range of features, with many users appreciating its customizability and robust project management capabilities. However, it is also noted for having a steep learning curve and some users have reported concerns about the user interface being cluttered or buggy. While the platform offers significant functionality in its free tier, users have expressed mixed feelings about its performance and reliability.

Testing Insights
ClickUp’s Gantt charts are clean and easy to configure.
While ClickUp isn’t as pretty as monday.com and Teamwork.com, it is incredibly functional. Navigation is straightforward thanks to a side menu, and jumping between tools is a piece of cake, as they’re listed at the top of the workspace. Most tools use a simple drag-and-drop mechanism, making them easy to use; however, some advanced tools, such as mind maps, have a learning curve. Overall, I don’t think teams will have issues with ClickUp. Still, if you find yourself in a pickle, ClickUp’s excellent knowledge base and university can help you.

Without a doubt, monday.com is the most user-friendly project management software you can get. The beautifully designed software and its many tools offer a hassle-free user experience. Aside from the usual gamut of features that include multiple views for task planning and management, resource management and collaborative docs, you’ll find expertly crafted templates for numerous industries that can get projects up and running quickly. The templates alone make monday.com ideal for teams who are new to project management software.
The customizable project templates on monday.com can help teams configure projects in minutes.
You’ll find plenty of other tools that can make your work life easier, too such as automations, support for integrations, artificial intelligence and beautiful dashboards that show key performance indicators. Regarding pricing, monday.com offers a free plan, but it is very limited, and the $12 per user per month (billed monthly) Basic plan offers poor value for money. However, the Standard and Pro plans, which cost $14 and $24 (billed monthly), respectively, offer some of the best value in the project management space.

Users appreciate its functionality for managing tasks and projects, although some find the platform to be expensive and limited in handling certain complex workflows.

You can create dashboards with multiple widgets on monday.com.
Within minutes of loading monday.com, I was able to find all the tools I needed and could navigate to any area of my workspace within a click or two. The bright, bold colors and well-designed menus make monday.com a joy to use. Creating integrations and configuring automations is straightforward, as is creating entire projects. There’s a reason why it made our roundup of the best Gantt chart software. I do wish monday.com’s lower-tier plans offered more user permissions and security tools, but overall, I think teams will hit the ground running with this solution.

Expert Take
Dozens of automation templates and a graphical automation builder that uses if-this-then-that statements make creating recurring tasks and automated cross-platform workflows in Teamwork.com easy. You choose time or event-based triggers and an action and you’re done. On top of automations, Teamwork.com offers an interface that rivals the beauty of monday.com. Collaborative documents, integrations, a messenger, reports, Gantt charts, Kanban boards, lists, custom fields and tags are also present.
Teamwork.com offers users numerous pre-made automation templates.
Teamwork.com also offers numerous budgeting and expense management tools, including invoices and billable time tracking. I believe its resource management and workload planners are superior to those found in monday.com and ClickUp. However, the cost of entry will scare off many SMBs. You’ll find a free plan that supports five users and multiple tools, and paid plans that range in price from $13.99 to $69.99 per user per month (when billed monthly). If you can stomach the cost compared to its competitors, you’ll appreciate what Teamwork.com offers.

Teamwork.com looks very similar to monday.com.
Teamwork.com is up there with monday.com regarding ease of use. The tools aren’t complicated and the design is great, but Teamwork.com’s AI isn’t as useful as AI tools found in ClickUp, Notion and Coda. If you need robust project budgeting and resource management tools and don’t mind the cost, Teamwork.com is a solid option. However, for less money, you can opt for ClickUp or monday.com and will only have to make slight compromises regarding those tools. If not for the cost, Teamwork.com would likely be nipping at ClickUp’s heels.

Expert Take
Coda is a unique project management software solution. Rather than silo each tool, it places all of them into one collaborative workspace. In practice, this means you have a single project document that houses your reports, forms, collaborative notes and workflow management tools. It’s easy to keep team members on track because they all work on the same page. Coda also offers automations and plenty of integrations, though I am not a fan of how Coda segregates integrations by plan. Version histories, comments and file uploads are also supported.
You can place any tool anywhere you want it in Coda.
Coda’s pricing is just as unique as its workspaces. Rather than charge for every use, Coda only charges for document makers. Every other user or editor is free. This is great for small teams or SMBs with a tight budget. However, Coda can get expensive if you need multiple doc makers. The free plan supports one doc maker and unlimited editors, however, there are tool limitations. Doc makers range in cost from $12 to $36 per month (billed monthly), depending on the plan you choose. There’s also a scalable Enterprise plan for large organizations.

Coda’s collaborative documents can be customized to your liking.
I won’t lie, when I first used Coda, I could not for the life of me figure out what was going on. The interface is alien compared to other platforms in this list because you’re greeted with a blank page. However, this is the beauty of Coda. While it can take a little while to learn how to add tools to your document, soon you’ll have a custom workspace that suits your team and project down to the ground. Take the time to learn how to use Coda and you will understand how valuable customizable workspaces can be.

Expert Take
If your SMB handles complex datasets and is still using old-school spreadsheets, you may want to look at Smartsheet. You can track tasks and projects on sheets, Kanban boards and Gantt charts, use formulas to complete calculations and link data across sheets. AI can create formulas, translate text and create drafts, and users can configure automations to handle repetitive tasks. Smartsheet also integrates with many software platforms, including but not limited to Slack, Power BI and the Adobe Creative Cloud.
If you like spreadsheets, you’ll be impressed with Smartsheet and all it can do.
Additionally, you’ll find detailed reports and tools for resource management and workload tracking. As you can see, Smartsheet isn’t your grandpa’s spreadsheet. My biggest caveat is that Smartsheet has too many premium add-ons for tools that should be included in most plans such as the calendar, custom workflow Bridge tool and its digital asset manager. Smartsheet offers a limited free plan for two users. Paid plans range from $12 to $24 per person when billed monthly. Customizable Enterprise and Advanced Work Management plans are also available.

Smartsheet is praised for its flexibility and powerful project management features, with many users finding its spreadsheet-like interface intuitive and easy to adopt. However, there are concerns about its cost, with some users finding it expensive due to additional subscription needs, and concerns about a lack of advanced features like robust reporting tools. Despite its strengths in automation and collaboration, the user experience is mixed, with criticisms aimed at the interface and certain functionalities.

The Kanban boards in Smartsheet are basic, but they get the job done.
During my time with Smartsheet, I found it quite easy to navigate between its various tools and spaces, thanks to well-placed menus and icons. Its sheets, which I think most users will gravitate towards, are incredibly powerful. However, if you don’t know how to get the most out of them with formulas, you’ll be better off picking an alternative platform, such as ClickUp, simply because Smartsheet’s Kanban boards and Gantt charts leave a lot to be desired. It’s not that they’re hard to use; they just feel primitive compared to those found in competing platforms.

Expert Take
Jira is a firm favorite of mine and many Scrum teams due to its exceptional Scrum boards, Kanban boards, timelines, backlogs, integrations and automation capabilities. Being a member of the Atlassian family, Jira seamlessly integrates with Confluence. Within Confluence, teams can collaborate on Definition of Ready (DOR) and Definition of Done (DOD) checklists and other documents that can then be added directly to user stories (tasks). Jira offers robust reports, supports story points for Agile estimation and offers easy-to-use issue and bug tracking tools.
Jira’s Scrum boards are customizable and easy to use.
While predominantly used by software developers, Jira’s many templates open its doors to numerous industries, including design, human resources, engineering and marketing. Regarding pricing, Jira offers a free plan that supports 10 users and unlimited projects, tasks, goals and forms. Its paid plans are affordable and work on a sliding scale (the more users, the cheaper it gets). Plans range from $8.60 to $17 per person (billed monthly) for teams up to 100 members strong. An Enterprise plan for teams with over 800 members is also available.

Jira’s backlogs allow product owners and developers to see which user stories need to be worked on during the next sprint.
SMB teams unfamiliar with Agile frameworks, such as Scrum, will be in for a rude awakening, as Jira has been designed with software developers in mind. Terminology catered to Scrum teams is littered throughout the platform, which will confuse those not in the Scrum loop. However, spend time with Jira, and I promise you will find it to be a capable platform that can help you collaborate with your team efficiently. If you’re just looking for Kanban boards, I would steer you towards Trello (Jira’s sibling), which made it into our roundup of the best Kanban software.

Expert Take
I have always seen Asana as the more refined brother to the louder and more colorful monday.com. Both are easy to use, but due to Asana’s subtle color palette, it looks a little more professional. Like monday.com, Asana offers multiple views, including Kanban, Gantt, timelines, lists and calendars. Collaborative notes, proofing, resource management tools and automations are also here. Where Asana pulls away from monday.com and others is with integrations. Asana offers over 100 native integrations that can be configured with a few clicks.
Asana simplifies integrating third-party software platforms.
The usual suspects of AI, messaging, user storage, user permissions, and mobile and desktop applications are also present in Asana. My biggest issue with Asana is the cost. I will say that Asana offers one of the best free plans, which is why it made our roundup of the best free project management software. However, the paid plans, which cost between $13.49 and $30.49 per person per month (billed monthly), make it an expensive option. Asana also offers Enterprise and Enterprise+ plans for those needing advanced security and premium support.

Testing Insights
Calendars are just one way you can track tasks and appointments in Asana.
For a platform that offers as many features as Asana does, I found it very easy to learn the lay of the land. Tools are easily accessible, advanced settings are simple to find and the tools on the desktop and web versions of Asana work flawlessly. There’s nothing complex about Asana, which makes it very accessible. A complaint I do have involves the Android application. Unfortunately, performance can be quite erratic. On slightly older devices, Asana is a stuttering mess, which leads to a frustrating experience. I hope Asana optimizes the app in the future.

Expert Take
Airtable will appeal to those who like using spreadsheets. However, unlike Smartsheet’s basic Kanban boards and Gantt charts, Airtable’s are robust, as are the lists, timelines, calendars, grid and gallery views. Airtable is capable of organizing structured data across relational databases, which can then be shared with team members across multiple departments. Airtable offers reports, automations, AI, a robust interface designer, a handful of integrations and a page designer that lets you create everything from feature sheets to business cards.
The number of workspace customization options in Airtable is impressive.
The no-code interface designer allows users to create custom interfaces by dragging and dropping elements. You can configure spaces that allow you to visualize and take action on data effortlessly. Airtable is just as capable as other software listed here and offers just as many features; it’s just expensive. There is a limited free plan that supports one workspace and five users. The paid plans cost between $24 and $54 per user per month (billed monthly). The Enterprise plan costs $70 per user per month.

Airtable’s many views make it suitable for teams using predictive methodologies and Agile frameworks.
I’ll be honest and say that if you don’t have time to learn how to use Airtable, you may want to look at another platform on this list. However, if you do have the time to learn, Airtable will rock your world. The Kanban boards, automation builder and other task management tools are child’s play. It’s the page designer, interface designer and relational databases that will eat your lunch. Still, when you learn how to use them and figure out how to link data across bases, there will be no stopping you and your team from achieving greatness.

Zoho Projects doesn’t look as nice as competing platforms but is functional.
Zoho Projects is not going to win design awards, but I can tell you the software is functional. A navigation panel makes zipping between workspaces straightforward, and easy-to-find drop-down menus house task views. Is Zoho Projects as user-friendly as monday.com and Teamwork.com? No, but it is not so complex that teams will become frustrated. Overall, Zoho Projects deserves its place on this list and our roundup of the best task management software.

Expert Take
Many project management solutions offer collaborative documents, but no one does them better than Notion, and that makes it the best solution for SMBs in marketing, design, engineering and content creation fields. Team members can collaborate on documents and wikis from the web and Notion’s desktop and mobile applications. Notion can also be used to design and publish websites. While Notion, in my opinion, isn’t as strong in task management as ClickUp, monday.com and others, it does offer lists, tables, timelines, Kanban boards and calendars.
Notion has perfected collaborative documents.
Additionally, you can find file storage and one of the best artificial intelligence tools. Notion AI, which costs $10 per user per month (billed monthly), is based on ChatGPT and can be used to draft content, summarize messages and tasks and generate insightful project data. Notion also offers integrations and automations so users can create cross-platform workflows. Notion’s free plan only supports individuals, but its paid plans are within reach of most. Plans cost between $12 and $18 per user per month (billed monthly). An Enterprise plan is also available.

Notion is a versatile and highly customizable tool that excels in organizing and managing information, making it a popular choice for a wide range of applications from team collaboration to personal productivity. However, while many users appreciate its extensive features and flexibility, there are criticisms regarding its complexity, lack of offline access and performance issues. It is favored for its clean interface and multifunctional capabilities, but there are concerns about its ease of use and speed, especially for new users who may find the learning curve steep.

Testing Insights
Notion’s interface is very clinical; you’ll either love it or hate it.
I find Notion easy enough to use. Navigation is very similar to that of ClickUp and monday.com, thanks to a navigation panel. While the task management tools aren’t as customizable or as feature-packed as those found in the previously mentioned platforms, they are more than serviceable. They’re fluid when in use and perform well across all of Notion’s apps. It’s the collaborative documents that will make you stick with Notion, though. They’re the reason why it made our roundup of the best marketing project management software.
Methodology
Software testing is a serious business. So, to give software platforms a fair trial, I use our proprietary rubric to rank multiple features. For the best project management software, 26 platforms were chosen, and 61 features across nine categories were analyzed. I then tested the top 10 platforms before awarding a final score to each provider.

How to Choose the Best Project Management Software
Choosing new project management software can be stressful. There are so many things you must consider before picking your first platform or switching to new software. In the coming sections, we’ll examine the features you need to be on the lookout for. We’ll also discuss value and how important ease of use is. Follow the guide below, and you’ll be able to implement new project management software without having to hire a change management professional.
Essential Project Management Software Features
Before picking new project management software, it’s essential to ensure it offers core features to help you and your team get projects across the finish line. Below, I have listed what I consider to be the most important features to look for when shopping for project management software.
Multiple views. Make sure the software you choose offers the views and workflow tools you need to get work done. The best project management software should offer a good mix of lists, sheets, calendars, Kanban boards and Gantt charts.
Collaboration tools. Whether your team is distributed or in-office, you should make sure that project management software offers features that will enhance collaboration. Look for collaborative documents, mind maps, whiteboards, instant messengers, and document and image proofing tools.
Resource management features. If you can’t keep on top of your available resources, your project will likely crash and burn. Ensure that the platform you’re eyeing offers resource management tools that let you allocate resources as well as estimate and forecast for personnel, materials and equipment.
Time management tools. As a project manager, it’s essential to know how and where time is being spent. Ensure the software you choose allows team members to track time spent on individual tasks. Time management tools will help you pinpoint problem areas and alleviate bottlenecks.
Project budgeting. The last thing you want to do is battle with scope creep. So, double- and triple-check your chosen provider’s features and ensure the software offers budgeting tools and planners that can help you manage finances.
Integrations. Every SMB uses multiple pieces of software to ensure daily operations run as smoothly as possible. When picking new project management software, ensure that it plays nicely with the software you already employ. Most providers list available integrations on their websites.
Automations. The best project management software must offer automations and be able to handle cross-platform workflows and recurring tasks without breaking a sweat. This is one tool that you should not compromise on, as it can drastically increase efficiency, reduce errors and save you money.
Risk management tools: If you don’t plan for issues and risks, you’ll be up a creek without a paddle when things don’t go to plan. Dig around provider websites or use free trials to see if the platform offers any risk management features. They can be in the form of pre-made documents or templates that work on boards and lists, it doesn’t matter. Just ensure they’re available.
Online storage: Projects generate plenty of documents and images, and you’ll need somewhere to store them. Look to see if your chosen provider offers a document management system (DMS) or lets you upload supporting documents to task cards. Also, make sure the plan you choose offers enough storage space for your needs.
Value
Before deciding on project management software, every SMB must consider how much value a platform or a particular plan offers. While it’s easy for me to recommend software, only you know what tools you need and how much you can afford to spend. Before taking the plunge with any software, analyze the plans offered from numerous providers to see which one offers everything you need at a price you can afford.
If you need to, take advantage of free plans until you have enough capital to move into a paid plan. Platforms such as ClickUp, Jira and Asana offer excellent free options. As a general rule, plan to spend from $6 to $12 per person per month on entry-level plans, $13 to $25 per person per month on mid-tier options and $25 to $70 per person per month on feature-dense top-tier plans. It’s vital that you determine your budget before making a commitment.
Ease of Use
We have spent a lot of time talking about the myriad features and tools project management software platforms provide, and while this is important, it would be remiss of me not to discuss ease of use. You can pick the most feature-packed project management software available, but if the software isn’t easy to learn and use, it’s worthless.
My advice is to use free trials to test each provider and its tools. Doing this will help you get a feel for the software and you can ensure that the tools on offer work how you need them to. I recommend creating fictitious projects so you can interact with lists, calendars, Kanban boards and Gantt charts. Play with automation builders, configure integrations and use collaborative tools to see if the mobile applications are stable. Taking the time to do this will help you make a solid decision that everyone will benefit from.

Which Project Management Software Is Best for Your Business?
Only you know what you need from project management software. My roundup can steer you in the right direction, but you must make the final decision. If you still don’t know which way to turn, consider the following:
If you have a limited software budget, ClickUp, Zoho Projects and Coda are the platforms I suggest looking at closely.
If you need robust collaboration tools, I suggest looking at ClickUp, monday.com, Teamwork.com, Asana, Coda and Notion. They all offer excellent real-time documents.
If you only use Agile frameworks, such as Scrum, divert your attention to Jira.
If you have a large team, I recommend ClickUp, Coda and Zoho Projects, as they offer very affordable paid plans.
If you prefer using spreadsheets, Airtable and Smartsheet are calling your name.
