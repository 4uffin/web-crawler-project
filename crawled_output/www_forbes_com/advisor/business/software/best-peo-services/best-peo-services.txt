A business’s workforce is its most valuable asset, yet HR management is not a core competency of most SMBs. Outsourcing HR and payroll to a professional employer organization (PEO) allows companies to offer first-rate support to their employees while freeing up managers’ time to focus on enhancing products and serving customers.
To realize the full value that PEOs offer, an organization must ensure that the service meets its HR and payroll needs, provides the level of support managers and workers require and is a good fit with its existing processes and culture. We highlight the areas in which each of our 10 best PEO services outshines the competition.

Expert Take
Few PEOs can match the quality advice and consultations that ADP’s TotalSource product offers. ADP’s HR business partners (HRBP) are credentialed in HR management and provide one-on-one advice on workplace and payroll compliance, employee relations and long-term workforce planning. The company’s MyLife Advisors are available to answer your employees’ questions in English or Spanish by phone or email during extended business hours. In addition to workplace safety consultants, ADP’s HR experts include a harassment and discrimination investigation unit, workers’ compensation claims specialists and area experts for benefits, taxes, scheduling and leaves of absence.

Many ADP TotalSource users express dissatisfaction with the complexity and user-unfriendliness of its payroll services. Common complaints highlight the time-consuming, costly and error-prone nature of the platform, with users frequently reporting poor customer service and challenges in dealing with support teams. While there are some mentions of its extensive insurance options and suitability for certain industries, these benefits are overshadowed by experiences of billing issues, administrative difficulties and concerns about the effectiveness of ADP TotalSource for small teams or businesses.
Pros & Cons
PEO service includes on-demand access to ADP’s HR and payroll experts
Expert advice covers implementation, workforce optimization and workplace safety evaluations
Employees can reach support staffers by phone or email during extended business hours
More PEO options than most small businesses need
Sells recruiting, performance management and other HR functions as add-ons
PEO services overlap the company’s administrative services organization (ASO) offerings

Expert Take
Key features of the Paychex payroll module are the Taxpay automatic tax administration service and Payroll Center integrated dashboard that puts all employee payroll information within easy reach.
Paychex promotes its PEO service to businesses of all sizes, but I’m having a hard time imagining how its feature-packed PEO offerings will scale down to small businesses. (Note that in addition to offering three comprehensive payroll/HR software products of its own, the Paychex subsidiary SurePayroll sells two low-cost payroll plans specifically for small businesses.)

What stands out to me about Amplify PEO’s benefits administration is the company’s 24/7 Health Advocacy Concierge service that’s staffed by professional healthcare advocates. Businesses have a choice of six medical benefit partners and can get assistance from Amplify in developing an optimized benefits strategy. In addition to medical, vision and dental plans, Amplify offers flexible spending accounts, employee assistance programs and prescription drug programs.

Amplify PEO users praise its comprehensive HR and PEO services that help small companies manage HR tasks effectively without needing an in-house team. Clients also appreciate its easy-to-use interface for accessing benefits, payroll and personal information, though some find specific features like PTO requests and the timeclock app challenging or confusing. Customer support is frequently praised for its responsiveness and efficiency, while the user interface and platform navigation is often cause for criticism. The platform is recognized for streamlining HR processes, although some users wish for improved mobile accessibility and more intuitive update processes.
Pros & Cons
Employees have 24/7 access to a health advocacy concierge
Gives employers a choice of six medical benefit partners
Expert assistance in optimizing your company’s benefits strategy
Claims to offer transparent pricing but doesn’t publish its prices
Return on investment (ROI) calculator doesn’t explain how the service saves companies money
Lacks the integration options of competing PEO services

Expert Take
When I ran a small business, the idea of outsourcing HR and payroll never crossed my mind despite the work involved in managing a staff of five in-office employees and about a dozen freelancers. After reviewing Justworks’s low-cost PEO service, I now realize what I was missing. The company’s PEO Basic plan costs only $79 a month per employee and supports multistate payroll, contractor payments, off-cycle payments as well as onboarding and offboarding employees, HR document management and time-off management.
The natural trajectory for many small companies is to start with Justworks’s DIY payroll offering priced at $50 a month plus $8 per employee and migrate to PEO Basic and PEO Plus as their needs change. This path prevents them from overpaying for payroll and HR while using a system that grows along with them.

Rippling’s PEO clients have access to the core capabilities of Rippling’s Workflow Studio automations, workforce analytics, policies and permissions. Businesses can enhance their employee benefits packages and reduce overall workforce costs by taking advantage of the volume discounts Rippling can negotiate with brokers as a PEO. The trade-off is the expense of having Rippling manage the benefits programs and other standard HR operations.
Compared to Rippling’s HR software, its PEO service gives clients less flexibility in customizing their HR solution. For example, Rippling charges a percentage of your payroll plus a monthly administration fee for its PEO service, while its HR software is priced based on a flat fee set by the services you include and your employee headcount.

Two pillars of HR are recruiting and employee performance management, yet few PEOs include these two important functions in their base plans. G&A Partners is a noteworthy exception. The company’s unified HR platform integrates recruiting and onboarding with automated payroll and employee management that covers performance reviews and skills development. G&A Partners’s performance management system links directly to its compensation and benefits so that raises, bonuses and other perks trigger automatically when workers achieve their performance goals.
I was equally impressed by the company’s recruitment process outsourcing (RPO) that prescreens candidates based on each client business’s unique requirements. G&A Partners works with companies to create a recruitment strategy that includes job analysis and job descriptions, coordinated requisitions and targeted candidate sourcing. The strategy covers skills assessments, interview preparation, activity tracking and recruitment analytics.

How To Choose the Best PEO Service
When you’re shopping for a PEO service, you’re not buying a product, you’re selecting a business partner that will serve as your co-employer.
Essential PEO Service Features
Among the aspects to consider when vetting PEOs are their accreditations, range of HR services offered, the services’ underlying HR platforms and their support options for managers/administrators and employees.
PEO accreditations. The IRS’s voluntary Certified Professional Employer Organization (CPEO) program indicates to employers that the PEO has met IRS standards, which include background checks, financial reporting obligations and third-party audits. The Employer Services Assurance Corporation (ESAC) offers accreditation of PEOs to confirm their financial stability, ethical operations and regulatory compliance. Engage PEO has both CPEO and ESAC accreditation.
Range of HR services. PEOs process their clients’ payroll in one or more states and handle most HR duties, including recruiting and onboarding, workplace compliance, employee performance management, training and development, benefits administration and workforce analytics. Deel, Rippling and Justworks go beyond the standard PEO services to offer employee practice liability insurance (EPLI).
Integrated HR platform. PEOs provide their business clients with a unified HR foundation that combines payroll and HR functions to make these processes faster, more efficient and more accurate. AI techniques enhance the effectiveness of HR platforms by personalizing the employee experience and adding predictive analytics that forecast workforce trends.
Support options. The PEOs in our ranking have HR and payroll experts on their staff who offer guidance and advice on demand, and who are available to answer questions and troubleshoot problems for employees. TriNet’s support reps are available by live chat 24/7 every day except U.S. holidays. Engage PEO also stands out in this area because all its HR advisors are licensed attorneys.
Value
Only a handful of the PEOs in our rankings publish their prices, which presents a challenge for SMBs shopping for PEO services. However, PEOs deliver value to SMBs by allowing their clients to access a broader range of benefits providers without requiring the purchasing power of large enterprises.
“[Enlisting a PEO] is a great way for [small businesses] to offer a wider range of employee health and wellness benefits,” HR consultant Tamica Sears explains. “They are also typically more affordable because of the larger employee pools offered by PEOs. When companies don’t have the resources to take on the liability of payroll, taxes, unemployment and other compliance items, PEOs can be a lifesaver. “

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
Which PEO service is best for your business?
The best PEO service for your company depends on your needs. For example, the size and geographic distribution of your workforce as well as the range and quality of benefits you want to offer your employees can all affect your PEO choice.
What’s the difference between a PEO and an administrative services organization (ASO)?
When your business signs up with a PEO, you enter a co-employment relationship with the company and share responsibilities and liabilities for managing your workforce while you retain full control of your business’s day-to-day operations and strategic planning. By contrast, when your company outsources its HR functions to an ASO, you remain solely responsible for managing your workforce.
What are the risks involved in outsourcing HR operations to a PEO?
The biggest concern of most SMBs that outsource their HR to a PEO is losing control over how their employees are compensated, although the business retains responsibility for setting worker compensation rates and workplace policies. It becomes more difficult and time-consuming to make changes related to payroll and benefits, and employees can lose some of their connection to the company’s culture and organizational values. Other PEO challenges relate to communication and integration, control of HR costs and data ownership and accessibility.
Do PEOs take full responsibility for HR and payroll tasks?
PEOs share some responsibilities and liabilities for managing your company’s payroll, HR, benefits administration and other important administrative tasks. They aren’t involved with the day-to-day management of your business operations or with strategic or financial planning.
Can a PEO replace in-house HR staff?
Rather than replacing your in-house HR staff, PEOs work with them to coordinate the provision of employee-related services and support and to communicate your company’s culture and unique characteristics. That’s why it’s imperative to establish a good working relationship with your PEO service from day one.

The Forbes Advisor editorial team is independent and objective. To help support our reporting work, and to continue our ability to provide this content for free to our readers, we receive compensation from the companies that advertise on the Forbes Advisor site. This compensation comes from two main sources. First, we provide paid placements to advertisers to present their offers. The compensation we receive for those placements affects how and where advertisers’ offers appear on the site.
This site does not include all companies or products available within the market.
Second, we also include links to advertisers’ offers in some of our articles; these “affiliate links” may generate income for our site when you click on them. The compensation we receive from advertisers does not influence the recommendations or advice our editorial team provides in our articles or otherwise impact any of the editorial content on Forbes Advisor. While we work hard to provide accurate and up to date information that we think you will find relevant, Forbes Advisor does not and cannot guarantee that any information provided is complete and makes no representations or warranties in connection thereto, nor to the accuracy or applicability thereof. Here is a list of our partners who offer products that we have affiliate links for.
