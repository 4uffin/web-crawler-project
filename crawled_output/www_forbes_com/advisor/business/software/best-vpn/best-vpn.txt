Meshnet, NordLynx, Panama jurisdiction
Expert Take
NordVPN takes the crown as the best option for home and business use. NordVPN’s performance is off the charts, making it ideal for streaming and one of the best VPNs for gaming. Security and privacy are also exceptional as NordVPN operates under the jurisdiction of Panama, meaning it’s outside of Five Eyes, Nine Eyes and Fourteen Eyes government surveillance and sharing programs. Additionally, NordVPN subjects itself to regular third-party audits, has a no-logs policy and has more than 7,000 servers in 118 countries.
NordVPN’s interface is bland but functional.
NordVPN also offers Meshnet, which lets you create a private encrypted network, malware, phishing, ad and tracker blockers, a dark web monitor that alerts you about your leaked information, dedicated IPs and support for every major operating system. You’ll also find split tunneling, a kill switch, double VPN (multihop), streaming support and the strongest protocols, including OpenVPN, WireGuard (NordLynx), NordWhisper and IKEv2/IPSec. The downside is that NordVPN starts at $12.99 monthly, however, heavy discounts exist for long-term plans.

NordVPN has received mixed reviews from users. Many users appreciate its security features, ease of use, and ability to unlock geo-restricted content, citing its speed and reliability across multiple platforms. However, user sentiment is dampened by frequent complaints about connection issues, unexpected costs, and unsatisfactory customer service experiences, with some users claiming automatic renewals at higher prices without adequate notice. Although some users report positive experiences with customer support, others express dissatisfaction with its efficiency and transparency, contributing to a general sentiment of frustration among parts of the user base.
Many of NordVPN’s users appreciate the platform’s security, speeds, reliability and how easy it is to unlock region-blocked content. However, many users complain about billing practices and substandard customer service. There are also a few complaints about how affordable plans become incredibly expensive after the initial contract ends. With NordVPN, if you pay attention to the small print, you’ll be just fine.

Testing Insights
NordVPN’s settings are easy to configure, thanks to well-designed menus.
I have not come across another VPN that puts up performance numbers like NordVPN. With no VPN, my home connection speed was 481.31 Mbps at the time of testing, and with NordVPN connected to the closest server, it only dropped to 401.63 Mbps, which is outstanding. Even speeds when connected to distant servers were blazing fast. I noticed no domain name system (DNS) leaks when using ipleak.net and all data remained encrypted when using Wireshark. NordVPN’s user interface could use a touch-up, but you’ve got nothing to worry about in terms of performance.

Expert Take
Based in the British Virgin Islands, which is outside the scope of the Five, Nine and Fourteen Eyes alliances, PureVPN is a rock-solid VPN that not only encrypts your data and hides your online presence but also keeps you safe by offering a robust dark web monitoring tool. While PureVPN isn’t the only one to offer these tools, I will say PureVPN’s is the best I have used. If your accounts, Social Security number, phone number, credit cards or email addresses are compromised, you get alerted immediately. There’s also a handy password manager, too.
PureVPN’s clean menus make access to the dark web monitor and password manager quick and easy.
In terms of features, PureVPN provides access to over 6,000 servers in more than 65 countries, some of which are dedicated to streaming, and offers split tunneling, obfuscated servers, a kill switch, AES-256-bit encryption and supports WireGuard, OpenVPN and IKEv2/IPsec protocols. Unfortunately, PureVPN does charge extra for features such as dedicated IPs, port forwarding and shareable static IPs with dedicated servers. PureVPN’s pricing starts at $12.95 per month, but offers significant discounts on one, two and five-year plans.

The overall sentiment of user statements about PureVPN is mixed. While some users had positive experiences with the service, noting quick and effective customer support, reliability, and ease of use, many others reported negative encounters, particularly around billing practices such as auto-renewals without notification and difficulties obtaining refunds. Technical performance issues, such as slow speeds, constant disconnections, and incompatibility with certain streaming services, were also highlighted. Despite some users finding value in its features and services, issues with customer service and transparency regarding pricing and cancellations have contributed to a less favorable perception among others.
Overall, user reviews about PureVPN are mixed. Customers are generally happy with the service and the features on offer, its customer support staff and its ease of use. However, there are many users who aren’t happy with some billing practices, specifically regarding auto-renewals. Other areas of contention include its inability to stream content from some providers and service malfunctions.

PureVPN passed the DNS leak test on ipleak.net.
PureVPN is a user-friendly VPN that everyone from VPN newcomers to old hats will have no trouble using. Configuring the software is a piece of cake thanks to well-designed menus, and using advanced features, such as the dark web monitor, is straightforward. In terms of speeds, while not the fastest, PureVPN is no slouch, with download speeds hitting 144.61 Mbps when connected to the fastest server with OpenVPN. PureVPN also passed a DNS leak test on ipleak.net, and all data packets remained encrypted during a test on Wireshark.

Expert Take
Online gamers will be quick to tell you the dangers of DDoS attacks and sniping; however, with a VPN, you can hide your online identity and protect yourself. In my opinion, Surfshark is one of the best VPNs for gaming due to its RAM-only server count (over 3,200), low latency and high speeds. When you add robust VPN protocols (WireGuard, IKEv2 and OpenVPN) and ChaCha20 and AES-256-bit encryption methods, you have a fast, secure VPN that lets you focus on high scores and not whether your bitter opponent can trace your IP.
Surfshark’s interface is highly polished.
As you’d expect from a top-tier VPN, Surfshark has a no-logs policy and offers a large arsenal of tools to keep you safe, including a kill switch, split tunneling, obfuscated servers, which hides the fact that you’re using a VPN, multihop (double VPN), static and dedicated IP addresses and a NoBorders tool, which helps you bypass restricted networks. The biggest downside to Surfshark is the monthly price of $15.45, which is significantly higher than most VPNs. As with other providers, you can lower costs by choosing a long-term plan, but that’s not always ideal.

Overall, the feedback on Surfshark reflects a mixed experience. While many users praise its affordability, customer support, and effective service on certain platforms, there are notable complaints about connectivity issues, misleading unlimited device claims, and a problematic refund policy, which some users have found frustrating and unsatisfactory. The speed and stability are also points of contention, with some finding it reliable while others experience issues. Despite these mixed reviews, Surfshark’s customer service, especially individual agents, receives commendations for being helpful, though the automated responses and general service policies do face criticism from some users.
Surfshark customers are happy with its affordable plans, excellent customer service and functionality. However, some users claim Surfshark lies about its unlimited device claims. This is not something I have experienced. There are also several complaints regarding the company’s refund and general service policies. Regarding speeds, it’s a mixed bag with some users being very happy and others stating connections are too slow.

Surfshark makes it easy to configure advanced features such as multihop.
I have used Surfshark to stream on platforms such as Netflix and BBC iPlayer and have always made it through geoblocks. All of Surfshark’s servers are 10 Gbps, meaning connection speeds, even at a distance, are fast. When connecting to a local server, I hit 243.56 Mbps, which is very respectable. I found latency (ping) to be fine, with my average hitting 67ms. I used ipleak.net to test for DNS leaks and didn’t find any, and Wireshark showed that all data packets were encrypted. My only complaint is that the mobile apps are fussy and hard to navigate.

Expert Take
If you have no budget for a VPN but need online protection, Hide.me is one of the best free VPN options. The free plan supports one device, unlimited data, eight selectable server locations, offers a kill switch and doesn’t require you to sign up. It also takes advantage of Hide.me’s zero-logs policy. Jump into the paid plans and you’ll get access to over 2,600 servers in more than 91 locations, streaming support, split tunneling, port forwarding, the SmartGuard ad blocker and multihop functionality so you can route data through multiple servers.
Well-designed menus make navigating Hide.me straightforward.
Device and OS support is also strong. You’ll find clients for Windows, Linux and macOS, as well as extensions for Chrome, Firefox and Edge, plus support for Apple TV, Android and Fire TV and router installation. I appreciate that Hide.me publishes independent audits and offers multiple ways to pay, including PayPal, credit card, Amazon Pay, Google Pay, bitcoin and kucoin. While the monthly plan costs $9.95, Hide.me’s steep discounts make it one of the best cheap VPNs. The one-year plan costs $4.49 monthly, while the 27-month plan drops to $2.39 per month.

Overall, user feedback indicates that hide.me VPN is highly regarded for its fast, reliable, and secure service, with a strong emphasis on privacy protection, no-log policy, and a user-friendly interface. Many users appreciate the generous free tier and find the customer service responsive and helpful. However, some users have reported issues with inconsistent connectivity, particularly with certain server locations, and occasional challenges with torrenting and technical support.
Overall, Hide.me’s user base loves the fast connection speeds, reliability and the security levels. They appreciate the no-fuss software, the levels of customer service and the range of abilities included in the free plan. However, some users have reported connectivity issues, which is something I experienced during testing, and some disturbances when torrenting. However, Hide.me’s reputation is solid.

My VPN connection dropped, forcing Hide.me’s kill switch into action.
During testing, I was pleasantly surprised by Hide.me. While the interface is nothing to write home about, I found it easy to connect and disconnect from the service, dive into the settings menus, choose various protocols and switch servers. Download and upload speeds were always high, making it easy to stream shows and play games without issue. While testing encryption (which passed), my connection dropped, forcing the kill switch to activate. It was good to see this in action in real time. I have no qualms about recommending Hide.me.

If you have a household with a range of devices, including gaming handhelds, mobile phones and tablets, Private Internet Access, with its support for unlimited device connections, could be for you. Not only will you find applications for iOS and Android devices, but you can also install PIA on your router, which will automatically cover every connected device. PIA’s suitability to be used on multiple mobile devices helped it secure a place in our roundup of the best mobile VPNs.

Private Internet Access (PIA) has garnered mixed reviews, reflecting both positive and negative experiences. Users often appreciate its affordability, ease of use, and no-logs policy, making it a solid option for those looking for privacy at a competitive price. However, many users have encountered technical issues, such as connection instability or latency problems, and have voiced concerns about customer service responsiveness and the company’s ownership by Kape Technologies, which has led to trust and security apprehensions. Additionally, some users find its performance inconsistent, particularly for streaming services, contributing to a sentiment of dissatisfaction among parts of its user base.
Many users are happy with the performance, ease of use and PIA’s competitive prices. PIA customers also applaud the company’s no-logs policy. However, several complaints discuss connectivity issues, slow customer service response times and streaming issues. I have not experienced issues with connectivity or streaming, but I do agree about the levels of customer service. Still, most PIA customers are happy with the service.

Switching between protocols is straightforward on PIA’s desktop and mobile apps.
You won’t have many complaints about PIA’s user experience. Choosing and connecting to servers on desktop and mobile is straightforward, as is picking which protocol to use. I found data speeds on close servers to be fast, good enough for gaming and streaming, while speeds dropped significantly when connected to servers in Asia. PIA passed Wireshark encryption tests and did not leak my DNS when connected to ipleak.net. The biggest downer is that PIA is located in Denver—the U.S. is a country that participates in Five Eyes.

Expert Take
ProtonVPN has a huge global network of close to 13,000 servers in over 110 countries, and offers 116 servers in privacy-friendly countries such as Switzerland and Iceland. ProtonVPN’s wide server network makes it one of the best VPNs for streaming. It enables you to bypass geoblocks so you can watch your favorite shows from anywhere. Plus, it offers clients for Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS, Chrome and Firefox, and supports Apple TV, Android TV and Fire TV. It can be installed on routers, meaning you can watch your favorite shows on any device.
ProtonVPN’s interface is clean and can be adjusted in size on the desktop.
Along with an ad blocker, a kill switch, Tor Over VPN and protocols which include OpenVPN, WireGuard and IKEv2, ProtonVPN boasts a no-logs policy, provides access to third-party audits, and is located in Switzerland, meaning it is bound by some of the world’s strongest privacy laws. It’s also outside the scope of Eyes alliances (government surveillance and sharing programs). Regarding pricing, there’s a free plan with access to a few servers. The monthly plan costs $9.99, but you can save 50% and 70% when you commit to one or two years of service.

Proton VPN receives mixed feedback from users, with appreciation for its free tier offering no data limits and strong privacy features, but criticisms for issues related to connectivity, speed, and platform compatibility, especially on Linux. While many users commend Proton VPN’s commitment to privacy and transparency, some experience slow speeds and technical difficulties that affect streaming and general usage. The free version is particularly praised for its solid security and lack of advertisements, though users looking for advanced features and better performance may find the paid tiers more beneficial, despite occasional customer service frustrations and perceived high costs.
Real-world ProtonVPN users love the provider’s free plan, which offers excellent levels of security and unlimited data. However, there seems to be a large contingent that experiences slow speeds, technical difficulties and issues when streaming content. I cannot say I have experienced the same when using ProtonVPN, but your mileage may vary. Overall, the platform is well-received, but users do wish the platform were slightly cheaper to use.

Wireshark proves that data through ProtonVPN is always encrypted.
In my years of using ProtonVPN in my own home, I can say that I have never experienced any issues while using the service. Setup is quick and easy, choosing server locations is straightforward and bypassing geoblocks to watch content on platforms such as Netflix, Disney+ and others is a piece of cake. I have a 1GB internet connection and routinely see speeds over 300 Mbps when connecting to ProtonVPN’s local servers. I also do not worry about encryption.

Expert Take
While Mullvad won’t blow you away with the fastest speeds, features such as password managers or ad blockers or flashy applications, its focus on security and commitment to keeping you anonymous will. Mullvad has a strict no-logs policy, requires no email address to sign up, accepts multiple forms of payment, including cash, for completely off-the-books transactions; and uses the strongest encryption (AES-256-bit) and protocols (OpenVPN and WireGuard).
Mullvad’s interface is small, but despite its size, it is easy to use.
To help keep you safe online, Mullvad offers tools for multihopping, a kill switch to sever your connection immediately, split tunneling and quantum-resistant tunnels for macOS, Linux and Windows machines that even quantum computers cannot decrypt. Mullvad also proudly shares its third-party audits so you can have peace of mind. While Mullvad doesn’t offer a free plan, its plan is affordable and simple. You pay just 5 Euros ($5.69 at the time of writing) per month. Mullvad’s low price of just 5 Euros hasn’t changed since 2009, which is a huge win in my book.

Most users highlight Mullvad VPN’s strong focus on privacy and security, praising its no-logs policy and the ability to pay anonymously with cash or cryptocurrency. Users appreciate its straightforward pricing of around 5 euros or dollars per month, without needing long-term commitments. However, some users report connection issues, particularly with streaming platforms, and have noted the recent removal of the port forwarding feature as a drawback. Overall, the sentiment is favorable, but these issues introduce some mixed feelings.
Mullvad’s simple pricing structure, strong focus on security and privacy, and acceptance of cryptocurrency and cash as payment have found favor with the majority of its customer base. However, some users report issues when streaming content and dislike the removal of port forwarding. Overall, Mullvad has a solid reputation and receives high praise.
Pros & Cons
Incredibly strong security
One affordable price, many ways to pay
No bloat, just the tools you need to stay anonymous

Mullvad’s application labels settings clearly.
The Mullvad user experience is a good one. You pick a server, a protocol, whether or not you want to use split tunneling and you hit connect. Just like that, you’re protected online. The applications aren’t flashy and are easy to navigate. Regarding speeds, I kept roughly 85% of my base connection speed when connected to servers in the U.S., which is excellent. However, jumping to another continent proved to be challenging, with Mullvad delivering inconsistent speeds and high latency. Still, it passed ipleak.net and Wireshark tests with flying colors.

Expert Take
One of the biggest hurdles travelers to China have to overcome is bypassing the country’s strict censorship of the internet. While you can use local VPNs, many have backdoors that allow China’s government to spy on you. Many VPN’s listed here have been blocked from working in China, however, Astril VPN is capable of breaking through China’s Great Firewall. So, if you’re a casual visitor or the owner of an SMB who visits China, this is the VPN for you. Astril VPN has a network of physical servers in Asia as well, so you can get the fastest speeds while visiting.
As you can see, against the backdrop of forbesadvisor.com, Astril VPN’s user interface is tiny.
Astril VPN offers what’s necessary. You’ll find OpenWeb, StealthVPN, WireGuard and OpenVPN protocols, plus support for multihopping (routing traffic through two servers), private (dedicated) IPs, VPN sharing, split tunneling and support for DD-WRT router installation. You’ll also find a kill switch, port forwarding and dedicated IPs. Astril VPN provides mobile applications and has a strong no-logs policy. Price will be the biggest deterrent to many. With monthly plans costing $30, Astril VPN may prove to be cost-prohibitive for many.

Overall, user feedback for Astrill VPN is predominantly negative, with frequent complaints about instability, frequent disconnections, and a perceived lack of support and responsiveness from customer service. There is a notable dissatisfaction with its high price point, especially as many users believe the service quality has not kept up with the increasing costs. Despite some users appreciating its functionality in restrictive regions like China, the overall experience is marred by outdated applications, inconsistent performance across different devices, and an inflexible refund policy.
Astril VPN doesn’t have the best reviews from its users, with many complaining about the price point, service instability and its outdated user interface. I do agree that Astril VPN is costly and that its interface needs a refresh. However, users love the platform’s ability to work in censored countries, such as China, which is Astril VPN’s main selling point. If you need to beat the Great Firewall, there’s no better choice, but the overall sentiment is that if you don’t need that ability, you might be better off looking elsewhere.

My connection speeds while using Astril VPN were some of the fastest I have seen.
I have no complaints about Astril VPN’s performance. No matter what server I connected to, national and international, my speeds were fast enough to browse and stream content. Overall, Astril VPN is simple. Finding settings is as easy as hitting a hamburger button, scrolling through the list and toggling options on and off. The biggest issue I have is the size of the interface; it’s tiny and cannot be resized. While some may appreciate this, others will find it frustrating. If you can look past this, you’ll appreciate what Astril VPN offers, especially if you travel to Asia often.

Expert Take
If you have many personal devices that you need to protect, Windscribe may just be the VPN for you, due to its ability to support unlimited simultaneous connections. SMBs need to look elsewhere, though, as Windscribe’s policy clearly states the benefit is for personal devices only, and if anything looks off, your account will be banned. With that warning out of the way, we move on to features, which include physical RAM-disk servers in 69 countries, though Windscribe refuses to list its actual server count as they fluctuate.
Windscribe’s interface is pleasant to use and navigating menus is hassle-free.
Dig into Windscribe and you’ll find a firewall instead of a kill switch, port forwarding, support for split tunneling, static IPs, multiple VPN protocols, which include WireGuard, OpenVPN and IKEv2; an ad and tracker blocker and multiple platform and router installation support. You can also use double hop to connect to two Windscribe server locations. Windscribe openly discusses its third-party audits, transparency and zero-logs policies. Windscribe’s free plan offers 10GB of monthly data and every tool. Its paid plans start at $9 per month.

Windscribe is generally well-regarded for its performance, ease of use, and generous free plan offering, but it has received mixed reviews due to certain limitations. Many users praise its speed, security features, and effectiveness in bypassing geo-restrictions, often citing it as one of the best free VPNs available. However, some users have reported concerns with connectivity issues, limitations on free data, and an unsatisfactory customer service experience. Overall, the perception of Windscribe is positive, although it doesn’t fully meet the highest expectations due to occasional service and support shortcomings.
In general, Windscribe’s real-world users love the VPN’s performance, how easy it is to use and the generous free plan. Windscribe’s speed and ability to bypass geo-restrictions, in particular, are lauded repeatedly. However, some dislike the data limitations of the free plan, and a few customers have complained about slow customer service response times and connectivity issues. Still, the majority of users have nothing but positive things to say about Windscribe.

Speeds on Windscribe are slower than most but still fast enough for streaming.
Windscribe offers a pleasant enough experience when in use. It’s easy to choose servers to connect to, and switching between protocols is simple. One area that could use improvement is Garry, the AI bot. When you ask a question, the answers received are often not about the subject you asked about. In use, speeds were just average. I hit 72.72 Mbps down and 30.29 Mbps up when using a 1GB connection to the fastest available server. It’s more than good enough for streaming and gaming. Windscribe also passed Wireshark’s encryption test, and I did not see any DNS leakage when using ipleak.net. In all, Windscribe performs well.

TunnelBear doesn’t get as much love as others in this list, but it deserves its place in this roundup thanks to its easy-to-navigate interface and solid feature set. You’ll find VigilantBear (a kill switch), SplitBear (split tunneling), which allows you to choose what data is encrypted, P2P support, more than 8,000 physical servers in 45 countries, multiple protocols, which include WireGuard, OpenVPN and IKEv2; and support for unlimited connections on paid plans.
TunnelBear’s interface is simple and easy to navigate.
TunnelBear also happens to be one of the best free VPNs. You can use the free plan through its Windows, macOS, Android and iOS applications. So, if you have a limited budget, you can rely on TunnelBear to protect 2GB of data each month free of charge. You can also get a free seven-day trial of TunnelBear’s paid plans if you want to try all of its features. Regarding pricing, TunnelBear costs $9.99 per month. You can save a significant amount of money (between 50% and 67%) if you opt to sign up for a one or two-year plan.

TunnelBear is generally considered user-friendly with an appealing design and is appreciated for its simplicity and ease of use, particularly among beginners. However, many users report issues with connection stability and speed, often describing it as slow compared to other VPNs. The free version is limited by a low data cap, which some find too restrictive for regular use, and while the software provides basic privacy features, more advanced users may require additional capabilities not offered by TunnelBear. Despite its intuitive interface, the service’s performance challenges and McAfee’s ownership have led to mixed sentiments about its long-term reliability and data privacy.
TunnelBear’s friendly user interface and ease of use are praised often in consumer reviews. The VPN is seen as the ideal starting point for VPN beginners. However, many have noted that TunnelBear’s speeds are slower than competing platforms and that it offers far fewer advanced features than most, which has made many users look elsewhere for online protection. TunnelBear being owned by McAfee is also a sticking point for many. Still, most users are satisfied with the service overall.

In the bottom-right corner, you can see that all data packets sent while connected to TunnelBear were encrypted.
I don’t think you can find an easier-to-use VPN than TunnelBear. The interface is delightful. From the moment you sign in with TunnelBear’s mascot watching you, to navigating and enabling the VPN, it’s plain sailing. I found speeds (339.01MB on a 1GB connection) to be more than sufficient for everything from streaming geoblocked content to gaming. As you can see in the image of Wireshark above, TunnelBear’s encryption is also rock solid. If you only need to secure a limited amount of data each month for free, TunnelBear is for you.
Methodology
Software testing is a serious business. So, to give providers a fair trial, I use our proprietary rubric to help rank multiple features. For the best VPN software, 15 platforms were chosen, and 48 features across eight categories were analyzed. I then tested the top 10 platforms. Each VPN was then awarded a final score.

Hands-On Testing
How To Choose the Best VPN
Before choosing a VPN, whether for a small to medium-sized business or personal use, you must ensure that a VPN provider has not made any compromises regarding core features. In the coming sections, I’ll cover the features that should be included in any VPN you choose, how to spot good value and why ease of use is important.
Essential VPN Software Features
When shopping for a VPN, I encourage you to check a provider’s features so that you can ensure the following are included.
Server locations. The more server locations that are available, the better. More servers mean faster speeds, lower latencies and the ability to break more geoblocks for streaming content.
Kill switch. A kill switch is a must-have VPN feature. Kill switches immediately break your internet connection if the VPN fails, meaning no matter what you’re doing online, your ISP and anyone else who is watching will not find out.
Split tunneling. Another must-have, split tunneling allows you to choose which data gets sent through the VPN tunnel, meaning you can protect only the data you need to without compromising speeds on the data that does not need to be protected.
Multiple VPN protocols. You need to do your due diligence and check that your VPN of choice offers multiple VPN protocols so that you can protect yourself in different ways while online.
Dedicated IP address. Ideal for business use, dedicated IPs can simplify connections, enhance protection, avoid IP blocks and avoid time-wasting CAPTCHAs.
Dedicated servers. Many VPNs offer dedicated servers that allow you the best connection for your activity. For example, dedicated servers can enhance connections for streaming, gaming and peer-to-peer networks. Double-check to ensure that your chosen VPN offers dedicated servers for your use case.
Mobile applications. Having VPN protection on mobile devices is crucial, as is having functional applications that allow you to quickly connect and disconnect while you’re on the move. Take advantage of free trials or money-back guarantees so you can take all applications out for a spin before committing to long-term deals.
Router support. Not all VPNs allow you to connect all of your devices simultaneously; however, if the VPN you choose can be installed onto your router, you can bypass device connection limits, as any device that connects to your router will be protected. Read our how to install a VPN on a router guide to get started.
No-logs policy. A zero or no-logs policy is a nonnegotiable. When a VPN says it has a zero-logs policy, it means it does not collect any data about you and what you’re doing. The VPN cannot see what you’re doing. So, even if the police or government authorities request data about your online behavior, your VPN won’t be able to provide any details, because it won’t have any to share.
Verifiable third-party audits. Any VPN that refuses to be audited by a third party or refuses to share independent audits is one you should avoid. Check to ensure the VPN you’re interested in is audited regularly and that it shares the findings with you. Any VPN worth investing in will have nothing to hide.
Value
When shopping for the best VPNs, you simply cannot spend too much time ensuring you’re getting the best security and privacy and the most features for your spend. While it’s easy to be impressed with the low prices VPN providers throw at you when you sign up, beware, as those good times don’t last forever.
Many VPN providers significantly lower the cost of their services when you sign up for longer plans (one and two-year deals). While these up-front deals for new customers offer excellent value, the fine print usually states that at the end of your contract, the price increases sharply, sometimes by as much as three or four times, so keep this in mind.
In addition, be sure to compare plans from multiple VPN providers to ensure you’re getting the most for your money. Some VPNs offer services such as dark web monitoring, malware protection and password managers. You should also check to see how many simultaneous connections are allowed, whether or not router installation is supported and that any other features you need are supported. Doing the legwork up front can save you a lot of time later.
Ease Of Use
The most secure VPN in the world is worthless if it is too hard to use. However, something as simple as ease of use is often overlooked in favor of low prices or good deals. I’m here to say, don’t overlook user-friendliness, especially when many VPN providers allow you to try their services for free. I highly recommend that you take advantage of free trials or money-back guarantees so that you can get your hands on the software.
Take the time to see how the desktop and browser extensions work, use services on mobile devices and, if possible, attempt to install the VPN you’re interested in on your router to see if it is easily achievable. Take the time to test drive software to ensure that your VPN of choice is easy to configure, navigate and use.
Which VPN Is Best For You?
If, after reading this roundup, you still cannot decide which VPN is right for you, take a look at the scenarios below:
If you have the need for speed, NordVPN is the best choice as it has routinely shown it provides the fastest connection speeds.
If you have many devices to protect, Private Internet Access, TunnelBear and Windscribe are for you, as they allow unlimited simultaneous connections.
If you have a tight budget and need a free plan, Windscribe, Hide.me, ProtonVPN and TunnelBear offer free plans that can protect your identity while you’re online.
If you need to remain completely anonymous, check out Mullvad as its no-compromises approach to privacy, which includes not needing an email address and accepting cash as payment, is unmatched.
If you travel to China frequently, Astril VPN is your best bet as it is still relatively unknown and not on the radar of the Chinese government. It can consistently bypass the Great Firewall.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
What is a VPN?
A VPN is software that allows its users to create a secure, private connection with servers around the globe when getting online. Free VPN software helps block your IP address, makes it look like you’re located in a different location and encrypts your data so that you can surf the web safely. Read our what does a VPN hide page to learn more.
Can free VPNs be trusted?
Yes, but not all free VPNs can be trusted. If you stick to the free plans mentioned above or those listed in our best free VPN roundup, you’ll be safe. However, if you choose any other VPN that offers a free plan, you may not be doing yourself any favors.
What else can I do to stay anonymous when it comes to VPNs?
If you want to remain completely anonymous when using a VPN, be sure to choose one that does not require an email address when creating an account. If you need to use an email address, use a service that creates a forwarding email address for you, such as Proton Mail or the Hide My Email feature on iOS devices. If possible, you should also pay with bitcoin or another cryptocurrency if accepted, or pay with cash.
What are the Five, Nine and Fourteen Eyes alliances?
Five, Nine and Fourteen Eyes are surveillance and sharing communities that government agencies participate in. While it is not legal for governments to spy directly on their citizens, these alliances, in theory, allow other countries’ governments to spy on different countries’ citizens and share information with other governments. For example, France could surveil U.S. citizens and share their data with the U.S. government.
What countries participate in the Five, Nine and Fourteen Eyes alliances?
The participating countries are the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Denmark, France, the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, Norway, Spain, Sweden and Italy.
