Expert Take
The rise in remote employment gives SMBs an expanded pool of potential candidates for their open positions. Managing a multinational workforce becomes as automatic as processing payroll for local employees with Remote’s global-focused payroll solutions. The company manages tax and regulatory compliance for operations in nearly 200 countries, including support from local experts in each jurisdiction.
Remote’s integrated payroll processing gives managers a clear view of their international operations, allowing them to check the status of payroll runs in all countries and the pay of all workers in a single window. The status of employee onboarding, expense reimbursements, work schedules and time-off requests are a click away. Managers can see at a glance which payroll runs are scheduled, in progress or awaiting approval.
Multinational companies get a single view of the pay records for all employees in a single window.
Companies gain deeper insights into their international payroll through Remote’s reports that cover year-to-date payroll costs, gross-to-net breakdowns, expense reimbursements and PTO for workers in all localities. Remote’s international compliance includes the IP Guard service that protects your business’s intellectual property by establishing a local entity to which IP rights are transferred and then passed back to your company. You also receive automatic compliance updates to your international payroll through the Remote Watchtower service that monitors regulatory changes and automatically updates your payroll system to maintain compliance.

Payroll and HR are two fundamental business processes that go together like peanut butter and jelly. Gusto’s affordable payroll packages make managing the two functions as easy as preparing a PBJ sandwich. You can move seamlessly between keeping tabs on your recent and upcoming payroll runs and checking the status of your recruiting efforts and benefits sign-ups. The simple Gusto interface puts all the controls you’ll need for both processes in a single window.
Payroll and HR options are easy to access in Gusto’s clear and intuitive interface.
The payroll features in Gusto’s entry-level Simple plan let you pay employees and contractors in a single state and include automatic payroll processing with the company’s AutoPilot feature. The HR features in the Simple package are basic but include health insurance administration, background checks and new-hire reporting to the state.
However, many SMBs are better served by the midrange Plus and high-end Premium packages sold by Gusto for $80 a month plus $12 per employee a month and $180 a month plus $22 per employee a month, respectively. The former adds next-day direct deposit and many more scheduling and time tracking capabilities, while the latter comes with a dedicated support manager, compliance alerts and access to certified HR experts.

Expert Take
Every homeowner knows that there’s a time to do it yourself and a time to let the pros take over. The same goes for SMB payroll services. Many companies will benefit by paying a Professional Employer Organization (PEO) to handle their payroll processing so they can focus on managing their business’s core activities. While many PEO vendors charge $200 or more per employee each month, Justworks’ PEO Basic and PEO Plus are priced at $59 and $109 per employee each month, respectively.
When you outsource your payroll operations to Justworks PEO, you can give your accountant and other third parties access to your payroll data and set the permissions each will have for accessing your payroll data. The options include managing expenses, making payments, processing timecards, and handling invoices and reports.
Set third-party permissions for accessing payroll data in Justworks’ PEO settings.
The PEO services from Justworks don’t allow you to create custom pay schedules or process tips, both of which are included with the company’s standard Payroll plan. However, both the PEO Basic and PEO Plus products come with 24/7 support and access to the company’s HR experts. Only PEO Plus has a full range of health benefits and advanced payroll and HR analytics.

Pros & Cons
Affordable PEO plans let businesses focus on their core operations
All Justworks plans support multistate payroll and contractor payments
Standard Payroll plan comes with compliance alerts and PTO management
PEO products exclude tip processing and custom pay schedules
Time tracking sold as an add-on for all packages
Comprehensive health benefits available only in PEO Plus

Expert Take
It’s no mystery why SMBs that use market leader QuickBooks for accounting would be drawn to the company’s payroll solution, a combination that’s available in three separate bundles from the company. Those products are far from the only integrations QuickBooks Payroll offers. In fact, there are hundreds of third-party integrations available for QuickBooks Payroll, including payment and expense-management tools, as well as dozens of non-QuickBooks accounting apps.
For example, companies that pay wages to employees and commissions to sales staff can link QuickBooks Payroll to one of 14 different commission management apps that work with QuickBooks Online to combine their compensation payments. If you’re switching to QuickBooks Payroll from ADP, Paychex or Gusto, you can migrate your employee information and payroll history directly to QuickBooks Payroll. The import wizard runs as part of your setup, giving you the option to upload your employee earning record and employee journal report from your previous payroll service by dragging and dropping them or selecting them in a file window.
Import your previous payroll and employee information when switching to QuickBooks Payroll in just a few steps.
Other QuickBooks Payroll integrations link your payroll operations with time-tracking apps, such as ClockShark and Timesheets.com, and sync with ADP RUN, Square Payroll, Paychex and dozens of other payroll apps. The product’s employee benefits integrations include Gusto, GoBenefits and Vestwell.

Pros & Cons

Expert Take
ADP RUN’s payroll reports go further than the standard financial records and analyses to cover your payroll liability, employee change and garnishments, as well as assigned property and employee skills, including their licenses and certifications.
ADP RUN’s reports go beyond the standard quarterly and YTD summaries to include job profiles, retirement contributions, and employee education and certifications.
The tax-related reports available with ADP RUN explain federal and state compliance requirements for quarterly federal tax returns (Form 941), annual federal unemployment (FUTA, Form 940), reports of wages and annual reconciliation of tax withheld for each state. ADP RUN’s custom reporting options let you base reports on employee or contractor data, payroll transactions, deductions or paid time off. The data can be filtered in more than a dozen ways, including net pay, special payments and payroll tax category.

Pros & Cons
Payroll and employee reports help boost productivity and operational efficiency
Reports can be customized to focus on liabilities, employee skills and benefit deductions
Integrates payroll for multiple companies and jurisdictions

Getting payroll right is a core competency of any business, especially considering the dire consequences of payroll failures. Square Payroll shows that you don’t have to pay a premium price to get a first-rate payroll service for your SMB. The list of payroll and HR features Square Payroll provides rivals the higher-priced offerings of competing vendors. In addition to payroll for employees and contractors, Square Payroll includes automatic payroll runs, employee self-onboarding, labor-cost reporting and multistate tax filings and payments.
It took me less than 30 minutes to create a Square Payroll account once I entered information about the company and a payment method. You start by designating and linking your bank account, then you add team members, set your pay schedule and sign up for benefits, if you wish. Time-tracking options include when your workweek starts, clock in/clock out preferences, and break and overtime settings. Lastly, you scan a QR code to download the Square Dashboard app.
Getting started with Square Payroll takes only a few minutes, including your company information, team members, payroll settings and mobile-app download.
Square’s reputation for affordable and easy-to-use POS systems carries over to its payroll services that works with its Shifts time-tracking and scheduling app, Team Communication collaboration tool and Advanced Access security app to create a complete workplace management system. Unfortunately, each of the four components is priced separately.

Expert Take
Rippling’s payroll service stands out for its ability to automate common workflows. For example, many businesses offer a bonus to employees who refer a job applicant who is ultimately hired. The standard way to track the referral bonus is to enter the trigger date on a payroll calendar and manually add the bonus on the next payday after that date.
There are any number of potential glitches with the manual approach to paying referral bonuses, starting with remembering to check the calendar before running the payroll that should include payment for the referral bonus. Rippling automates the payment trigger by allowing the manager to create a custom recipe, or automated workflow, that adds the referral bonus once the trigger event has occurred.
Rippling’s recipes make quick work of common payroll tasks, reducing the likelihood of human error causing a missed payment.
Paying the referral bonus becomes part of the onboarding process for the new hire by using a recipe template that triggers the payment automatically. Start by entering the conditions and trigger. In this example, the conditions to be met are the employee start date and an employee referral, while the trigger occurs 60 days after the new hire’s first day on the job. The referral bonus is then added automatically to the referring employee’s next paycheck.

Role-based permissions can be automated based on employee profiles
Provides side-by-side comparisons of current and past pay runs

Expert Take
If you ask your employees how soon they would like to receive their pay, the answer will likely be “yesterday.” Paydays can’t come too soon, which makes the OnDemand Pay feature of Paycor’s mobile wallet a sure way to boost the morale of your workforce. The earned wage access (EWA) capability allows employees to receive up to half of their pay as many as two days before their scheduled payday. The wages are transferred to a Paycor-issued Visa card and are accessible from the Paycor mobile app’s wallet.
The wallet in Paycor’s mobile app lets employees access up to half of their earned wages before payday.
The OnDemand Pay feature is free for employers, but workers may be charged a small fee, depending on the terms of the bank issuing the credit card. The funds on the card can be accessed through an ATM or used for in-person or online purchases. To help employees manage their finances, the Paycor app provides tools for budgeting, savings plans and other financial coaching.

Pros & Cons
OnDemand Pay feature gives employees early access to earned wages
Mobile app automatically adds early wage payments to the phone’s wallet
Employees are issued a Paycor Visa card at no cost to them or their employer
Early wage access may entail a small fee charged to employees
No guarantee of how soon the early wage payment will be available to employees
Entry-level payroll plan lacks general ledger report and other reporting options

I then conducted hands-on testing of the 10 products that we ranked the highest to determine the areas in which each excelled, as well as the type of business the product best serves. No matter what your payroll needs are or what type of business you operate, we’re confident that one of our top picks will be the right fit for your organization.

How To Choose the Best Payroll Service for Small Businesses
The best payroll service for your small business is the one that makes your payroll operations as accurate and efficient as possible while staying within your budget. Apart from price, the factors that have the greatest impact on the payroll service buying decision are meeting your payroll tax obligations, processing payroll runs quickly and simply, timely delivery of pay to employees and contractors, helpful payroll analytics, and easy, secure access to payroll data by managers and workers.
Essential Small Business Payroll Service Features
These are the key features of a winning payroll solution for your small business.
Automated processes. Automating payroll processes reduces the likelihood of payroll mistakes while also speeding up processing time. Rippling’s custom recipes save companies time and aggravation by limiting manual payroll operations such as creating off-cycle payroll runs for retroactive changes in pay rates.
Built-in compliance. Payroll tax filing and payments need to be done right the first time to avoid costly penalties. The best payroll services automatically file and pay employee tax withholding and other obligations to ensure your company maintains compliance. The Compliance Assistant built into TriNet’s payroll and HR outsourcing service automatically calculates, files and pays payroll taxes while monitoring overtime rules such as those in the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).
Direct deposit. Nothing will sour your relationship with your employees faster than delays in delivering their pay. QuickBooks Payroll, Square Payroll and Gusto’s Plus and Premium plans include next-day direct deposit of pay to workers’ bank accounts. QuickBooks promises same-day delivery when payroll runs are completed by 7 a.m. PT.
Employee portal. All 10 payroll services in our rankings offer employees access to their payroll data through a secure portal as well as by using a mobile app. However, Paycor’s mobile app shines, as it features a mobile wallet that lets workers access up to 50% of their earned pay up to two days before the scheduled payday.
Reports and analytics. ADP RUN’s payroll reports go beyond standard payroll reports by covering garnishments, local tax withholding by quarter, benefit deductions and partial or missed deductions.
Roles and permissions. Ensuring the security of payroll data requires limiting access to managers and employees alike. Justworks gives companies granular control over the information that administrators and managers can access. The company also lets you grant access to outside accountants and other third-party administrators. Rippling automates permissions by building them into profiles that limit view, edit and other actions based on specific roles.
Value
When calculating the cost of a payroll service for your small business, a primary consideration is the expenses you would incur if your payroll wasn’t done right. In addition to the time and effort required to correct mistakes in wages paid to employees and contractors, you have to factor in the penalties and other fees charged by government tax-collecting agencies for failure to comply with tax withholding and other regulations.
Payroll processing is a core business process that impacts nearly all other aspects of your operation, yet it can be a costly mistake for a business to purchase payroll features they don’t need. Look for a payroll service whose products give you the option to start with the basics and add functions as your payroll needs change.
Our pick as the most affordable payroll service for small business is Square Payroll, which packs plenty of high-end features into its single plan priced at $35 a month plus $6 per employee a month. These include unlimited payroll runs, multistate payroll, payroll automation and next-day direct deposit. Another affordable option is Wave Payroll, which costs $40 a month plus $6 per person a month and integrates seamlessly with the company’s free and low-cost accounting software.
Payroll Compliance
Every business bears responsibility for complying with federal, state and local laws related to employee compensation and following other payroll compliance best practices.
Small business payroll software automates many of these compliance requirements such as filing and paying payroll taxes automatically and alerting companies to upcoming compliance deadlines. They also help businesses classify their workers correctly as employees or contractors to avoid being fined for misclassifications, and they provide a record of payroll and employee time and attendance.
Third-Party Payroll Integrations
The most common third-party payroll integrations are employee time and attendance tracking, scheduling, retirement plans and health benefits, recruiting, compensation management and general accounting systems. Many small businesses find it most effective to purchase their payroll and HR support services from the same vendor, such as Gusto or Rippling, both of which sell plans that combine the two functions. Others choose products that integrate payroll with other accounting operations such as QuickBooks Payroll and Wave Payroll.
Retailers and restaurants can improve the efficiency of their payroll processing by going with Square Payroll, which links time, attendance, tips and other data collected by their POS systems to their payroll processes. The payroll services in our rankings that offer the most extensive collections of third-party integrations are Rippling, QuickBooks Payroll and ADP.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
What Is a payroll service?
A payroll service supports a business’s payroll operations by preparing payroll runs for salaried and hourly employees and contractors. It handles payroll tax calculations, filing and payment. It also deducts benefit premiums and other payments taken out of employees’ pay.
Do I need a payroll service for my small business?
Nearly all small businesses benefit by hiring a payroll service because of the added security the companies provide. Many payroll services offer a guarantee that their customers’ payroll will be 100% accurate and that they will comply with all payroll tax, filling, withholding and other regulatory obligations.
Do payroll services provide benefits administration?
Most of the small business payroll services we reviewed combine payroll processing with some level of benefits administration. Vendors such as Gusto and Rippling bundle their payroll and HR services, while others, such as Wave Payroll and Justworks, focus primarily on payroll and offer meager HR functionality.
Do payroll providers also handle taxes and compliance?
All the payroll services in our rankings calculate and file your business’s payroll taxes, and many pay the taxes automatically. The vendors offer varying levels of compliance support, ranging from Wave Payroll’s basic payroll compliance to TriNet’s outsourced payroll compliance services and Compliance Manager that’s bundled with its administrative services organization (ASO).
