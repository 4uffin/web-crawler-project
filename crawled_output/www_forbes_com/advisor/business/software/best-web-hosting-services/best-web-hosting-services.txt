Expert Take
Offsetting energy usage is at the core of GreenGeeks. Server farms generally have high power demands, and MIT found that the Cloud overall has a bigger environmental impact than airlines. GreenGeeks works to offset its energy use through supporting renewable energy projects.
Features
Server resources for GreenGeeks web hosting services are about average across the industry, but it’s the extras where it stands out. Free malware cleanups, free migration help, daily backups, multiple user support, a one-click installer supporting over 150 different applications and the 300% energy offset promise make GreenGeeks very attractive overall.
Personally, I’m especially fond of the included malware cleanups as cyberattacks against small businesses continue to grow, and SMBs generally don’t have the tech teams standing by to fix those often complicated issues.
Pricing
As with server resources, GreenGeeks is right in the middle of the industry for pricing overall, with slightly lower-than-average pricing for Managed WordPress included in the shared hosting plans. The smallest shared hosting plan starts at $12.95 per month with a $2.95 per month special offer for the first contract term.
Customer Service
GreekGeeks is one of a shrinking number of hosts offering help by phone. However, wait times can be lengthy. One of our customer service tests left me on hold for long enough to be told I was first in line several times. My concern is that if it takes that long for someone to answer when they aren’t busy with other customers, the staffing may not be at a level to cope when something serious happens to the service and many people are calling at once.
That said, initial setup and common tasks are made much easier with an online help database that actually spends time helping instead of throwing extra words at you. Steps are simply and directly explained with clear annotated screenshots of each step.
Reputation
Like many of the top web hosts, GreekGeeks seems to be suffering from a noted decline in customer support according to top review aggregators, although overall ratings still remain quite high. However, I am seeing more reports of billing issues with renewals being processed after cancellations or even domain renewal fees when the domain had already been successfully transferred to another domain registrar.

Expert Take
You’ve probably heard of Namecheap’s domain registration services, but it offers competitively priced website hosting as well. True to its name, prices start cheap, even without introductory offers, while including many items other hosts charge extra for depending on the hosting type.
Features
The included CDN and a website builder are great features for shared hosting. Honestly, though, they had me at guaranteed migration. Migrations should be easy, but something always seems to get stuck, even with automatic transfers.
Namecheap makes migration easy from other cPanel accounts and guarantees it will be complete within 24 hours with less than 15 minutes of downtime, or you get up to a year of free hosting. There are a few minor exceptions and certain VPS or Dedicated transfers come at a minimal $15 cost, but it’s still one of the best migration guarantees available.
Pricing
Namecheap sticks to its core concept of low pricing with its hosting plans. The most expensive shared hosting plan is under $10 on monthly billing and new customers can lock in the first two years at $4.88 monthly if you pay those two years upfront.
Customer Service
Like many hosts, Namecheap doesn’t offer phone service at all. Live chat and email ticketing are available 24/7, but I always urge caution to e-commerce and other time-sensitive businesses when there is no phone support because of the stakes if your site goes down.
Reputation
Namecheap has a good reputation, primarily from its original domain registration service. However, website hosting services tend to get good marks as well, other than the expected scattered reports of billing issues that are common in the industry.

Expert Take
Regardless of customer skill, managed hosting is a great option if you don’t have a large in-house tech department. It takes a lot of the behind-the-scenes management and update tasks off your hands so you can focus on your business.
Features
One thing I really appreciate about TMDHosting is the level of customization available. From having a choice between Windows or Linux hosting at the entry-level shared hosting plans to fully customizable hosting plans, TMDHosting gives companies room to grow without needing to swap hosts.
Most set hosting plans are fairly well-featured, with storage being the biggest difference. The only real head-scratcher is why the Starter shared hosting plan doesn’t include backups when the storage and number of websites limit differences between the Starter and next tier plan more than make up the under $4 monthly pricing difference.
Pricing
TMDHosting pricing for shared web hosting services is on the low side of the middle of the pack, and the multi-year pricing isn’t a large discount (around 20% at most). Honestly, that predictability and lack of a stack of price add-ons in the cart are a nice change compared to the pricing habits of many other web hosts.
Customer Service
As you might expect from a host with managed hosting, customer service is better staffed and more hands-on than unmanaged hosts. Plus, TMDHosting backs it up with a 15-minute customer support response time pledge that provides peace of mind when so many other hosts take days to respond to help requests.
While there is no phone service, which is one of my pet peeves, TMD offers Slack support, along with chat and email, which might actually be my new favorite support contact method.
Reputation
TMDHosting has one of the better ratios to raves and rants I’ve seen across review aggregators. But what really stands out is the polite and measured responses from TMD to good and bad reviews. It’s rare for hosting companies to acknowledge any sort of customer feedback today, and even if it’s all in the name of marketing, it’s more effort than other hosting companies make.

Expert Take
One of three featured WordPress.org recommended hosts, Hostinger offers a lot for WordPress websites and regular shared hosting. Items such as free email, free automated migrations, the AI website builder and WordPress staging are nice extras.
Features
Hostinger hits all the feature high points, includes high website limits (100-plus in some packages), storage is generous and I love that Hostinger offers Minecraft server packages so parents can keep all their hosting needs in one place.
While cPanel is powerful and some may miss it, I am glad to see Hostinger’s simplified dashboard for beginners. However, if you have a current cPanel plan somewhere else, it might complicate migration just a little bit.
Pricing
The non-refundable setup fee for monthly billing is my biggest gripe with its pricing. One month of the lowest-tier shared hosting runs $11.99 when you can get a full year of the same package at $35.88 plus a free year of a domain name with the introductory offer.
That add-on fee for monthly billing seems almost petty when you compare the pricing options. Yes, there is a 30-day money-back guarantee, but many have had bad experiences with other hosts not honoring guarantees and are skittish to trust the terms.
Otherwise, it is on the lower end of the average and quite affordable for most, even without annual billing discounts.
Customer Service
Everyone who knows me knows I mostly loathe AI chatbots. I detest having to wade through them to get a live person. Hostinger’s triage chatbot is a rare exception. The vast majority of the time, its answers are clear, concise and on point. It’s one of the few that saves me time over talking to a live person.

Hostinger is one of the few larger hosting companies that’s managed to keep a fairly stellar reputation. People love the service overall, and Hostinger’s team often steps in on common review aggregator sites such as Trustpilot to get more details and investigate if there are reports of trouble.

Expert Take
Kinsta is far from the cheapest host, but its specialization in managed WordPress hosting with outstanding tech support personnel makes it a great choice for anyone needing more support from their host. Kinsta also offers plenty of specialty hosting products that aren’t as widely available elsewhere.
Features
As a more full-service hosting provider, Kinsta takes managed hosting seriously and has extra features most hosts don’t include or charge extra for. Unlimited users with access controls, edge caching, malware removal, built-in application performance management tool (APM), API, firewalls, DDoS protection, backups, staging and Wildcard SSLs are just the start.
Pricing
For shared hosting, Kinsta mostly uses a website visit pricing model, where prices increase as your traffic increases. While that might sound concerning at first, when you consider the amount of security and extra tools Kinsta offers in its management packages, it makes sense. While pricing is higher than some other hosts on the surface, it’s rather cheap for the features and service offered.
Customer Service
Kinsta prides itself on support from real people who are skilled technical experts, not entry-level staffing. Although there’s no phone support, live chat is available 24/7 and my personal experiences with Kinsta staff have always been outstanding. Honestly, they type so fast when coding that I’m always amazed they haven’t managed to jam their keyboards. Problems are solved in record time.
Reputation
Kinsta has an outstanding reputation across review aggregators and hosting community discussions. Individuals and industry experts frequently recommend it for outstanding service and security.
Pros & Cons

Expert Take
Unlimited storage on shared plans is a big draw for image-heavy sites and the 100% uptime guarantee is a rarity, making DreamHost a serious contender for businesses who can’t afford downtime.
Features
One thing I really like about DreamHost is that plan features are more targeted to the type of hosting instead of a shotgun approach for a better overall experience. However, it also means you need to compare features carefully, especially if you are torn between types of hosting, such as shared and VPS. I’m also particularly fond of DreamHost’s custom dashboard. At least for beginners, it’s a less intimidating experience than cPanel for managing your account.
Pricing
Pricing is about average for hosting types, with standard deep new customer discounts. However, lower-tier plans sometimes wind up with a lot of extra add-on costs. For example, outside of new customer specials, some site migrations can cost $99 or more, and if your site is hacked, that’s another $199 to get help fixing it. Mostly, it seems like managed hosting by add-on for non-managed plans if you need help, and that gets costly fast. A colleague uses the Managed WordPress plan (just $34.99 per month) and when her site was hacked, they fixed it in minutes without needing to pay extra.
Customer Service
Callback phone support is a nice option and DreamHost also offers live chat and 24/7 ticket support as well. That said, if you aren’t logged in to get to a real human, the live chatbot is completely worthless and rarely understands even simple “yes” or “no” responses.
Reputation
DreamHost’s reputation is one of the better ones in the industry. However, it has taken a definite hit over the last few years with more reports of slow response times, declining customer services and random extra fees. Primarily, the unmanaged shared hosting seems to be the source of many concerns, with managed services and other hosting types faring better in consumer opinion.

Weebly builder
Expert Take
Hostwinds makes getting started easier for beginners. Getting your CMS loaded is one of the biggest hurdles for new website owners—especially with WordPress if you’ve only used website builders before. Hostwinds uses Softlaculous to streamline software loads and manage one-click installations for hundreds of web apps.
Features
Unlimited is the word of the day for Hostwinds shared hosting. Unlimited subdomains, bandwidth, storage, FTP accounts, databases and email accounts are included in all the shared plans. Plus, as managed hosting, it should take a lot of technical tasks off the plate of customers.
While the future is admittedly uncertain, at the time of writing, Hostwinds still offers the Weebly website builder. That’s a welcome alternative for Weebly users looking for a new website home after Square announced sunsetting the popular builder. The Hostwinds team tells me that an “equivalent service” will be offered if the Weebly builder is ever removed.
Pricing
Especially for managed hosting with so many unlimited features, Hostwinds is very competitively priced, beating out several hosts with far fewer features and services at the shared hosting level. Other hosting types aren’t quite as bargain-basement priced, but neither are they at the top end of pricing.
However, one thing I hate to see is a very short cancellation window and prorated refunds, it isn’t the most reassuring situation if you’re purchasing an expensive plan.
Customer Service
Sometimes when you talk to a customer service group you get a feeling something is off. That’s been my personal experience with Hostwinds customer service representatives. On the surface, the answers seem fairly accurate, but something about the conversation always feels a bit off after the conversation is over, even though you can’t always put your finger on what’s bothering you.
Reputation
Hostwinds’ reputation is the poster child for when things go wrong, it goes really wrong. Most users are very happy with plenty of glowing reviews. However, the not-uncommon tales of complete dumpster fires, especially with higher-priced hosting types, surrounding cancellations, lack of tech support help, high traffic time maintenance runs and server misconfigurations, are worth taking into consideration.

Expert Take
A lot of hosting companies seem to put more effort into higher-end hosting types and ignore shared hosting, although it has more customers. Mochahost seems to shift more towards giving shared hosting more attention but seems to fall down a bit with more advanced hosting types.
Features
Mochahost makes it easy to move your website with included migration services. That, plus a strong suite of hosting types, gives great options for most SMB hosting needs. Free first-year domain names, automatic backups, great storage and lots of hosting-type-specific goodies add up to a good value.
I am particularly happy to see the included automatic backups are off-site, adding another layer of security and disaster recovery.
Pricing
Shared hosting is fairly average in cost, but where Mochahost shines in cost is the website builder. It’s one of the lowest-cost builder packages available outside of free website builders. The under $8 monthly builder plan pricing is a great option for SMBs who need a basic website without the higher costs of builders such as Wix.
Customer Service
My personal interactions with Mochahost service reps have always been stellar, and, unlike so many hosts, the staff seemed to actually care about getting the answers I needed. I also like that it is one of the few hosts to still offer phone support in addition to live chat and email ticketing options.
Reputation
Mochahost is a rare host that avoids being roasted (yes, I’m a sucker for puns), even on Reddit. Most reviews are glowing on review aggregator sites as well.
However, there is a common thread of pricing concerns beyond the expectations for the web hosting sites. There appears to be a repeated issue of not honoring price locks and lifetime pricing guarantee programs, with responses from Mochahost to those complaints simply saying some version of an increase was necessary and not addressing the complaints of broken guarantees.

Expert Take
IONOS skews more towards being an enterprise-level hosting provider, but there are still plenty of hosting plans for SMBs, too. One thing I love is that all that enterprise-level infrastructure helps underpin some of the smaller hosting plans. That is, while the shared servers aren’t the same as the cloud servers, they’re one of the same tightly secured data centers (Kansas), so you get great physical server security at a bargain price.
Features
Unlike providers like GoDaddy that make finding out what you are paying for feel like pulling teeth, IONOS offers very detailed feature comparison lists for plans so you know exactly what you are getting. Features on most shared plans include email, mobile admin tools, malware scanning, backups, DDoS protections, Wildcard SSLs and unmetered bandwidth.
However, I usually urge caution with unmetered features, as it is basically shorthand for “we’ll let you know if we think you are using too much” instead of just telling you a number so you can self-monitor.
Pricing
While I’m not a fan of the price jumps from deep discount introductory offers, I do like IONOS’ unadvertised “buy two years, get one free” offer on some of the shared plans. If you pay for 36 months upfront, you only pay for 24 months for the first term. Renewals are for the full 36-month pricing, though. This offer only shows up once you’ve added a plan to your cart, so you’ll have to click around a bit to find which plans offer it.
Customer Service
When I’ve talked to IONOS customer service, they’ve always been clear and direct with answers in a reasonable time frame. They also offer 24/7 phone support, although it isn’t toll-free. Especially for e-commerce sites, I always recommend looking at hosts offering 24/7 phone support since downtime is particularly costly for that business segment and the need to reach tech support quickly can be vital.
Reputation
Overall, IONOS is a great web hosting option, as it has a fairly strong reputation across review aggregators, with far fewer complaints than other shared hosting providers. However, there are a few areas where power users seem to repeatedly list concerns on topic-specific discussion boards. Domain security is the biggest, followed by complaints that IONOS prevented them from installing a third-party SSL.

Expert Take
InMotion Hosting is an established host that seems to fly under the radar in most hosting discussions. Features and pricing are all pretty middle-of-the-road, with high points, including the higher starting storage limits.
Features
Like all web hosting providers, InMotion Hosting’s features vary by plan. Common shared hosting features include hack, malware and DDoS protections, email, unlimited bandwidth, customer management tools, caching and support for a variety of web frameworks.
However, uptime guarantees and many other features don’t apply to entry-level plans, pushing users to pay the extra couple of dollars a month after catching their attention with the lower entry-level pricing.
Pricing
In spite of apparently using the entry-level shared hosting plan to grab attention, even that plan isn’t particularly low-cost compared to other similar providers. In fact, it’s closer to the high end of the scale for shared hosting, especially for unmanaged shared hosting (it offers managed servers, not managed hosting for most plans). Now, if you pay three years upfront, you can save 71%, but for most SMBs, that’s a large chunk to pay at one time.
Customer Service
Honestly, I can’t say much about InMotion Hosting’s customer service. While I’m sure there are some very skilled staff members, the one I talked to during my testing was just determined to split hairs to make the service sound like more than it actually is. Specifically, he would answer questions about managed hosting by focusing on managed servers, which are two different things. Personally, it was a huge red flag for me, so I wouldn’t recommend them for beginners.
Reputation
InMotion Hosting has a mixed reputation. Most seem happy with the shared hosting, but there are numerous complaints about VPS hosting and technical support concerns. For most hosting services, this is usually reversed. That said, tech discussion boards seem far happier with InMotion, with many defending it against smaller web hosts claiming they had to fix what InMotion allegedly broke for clients.

How To Choose the Best Web Hosting Service
Let’s cut right to the bottom line. If you have never had a website before, 99.9% of you will only need a shared hosting plan in the beginning. If you are starting an e-commerce business, you may need shared hosting with more server resources, but shared is usually enough for most initial SMB website launches.
There is a dizzying range of considerations for picking a host and plan. However, asking yourself the following questions will help you narrow down what best suits your needs.
Does the plan offer enough bandwidth or have a high enough website traffic limit for your expected visitor load?
How much do you have to pay upfront? In other words, can you pay monthly or must you pay for several years of hosting at one time?
Is it managed or unmanaged hosting? Managed hosting provides more technical support.
Is an email account included?
Is there a website builder?
What are the host uptime rates or guarantee?
What are the server response times? How fast will the server respond to data requests? The best web hosting server will provide a service level agreement (SLA).
Is it portable? Can you migrate your website to another host later?
Essential Web Hosting Features
Essential web hosting features will depend heavily on the type of hosting you need. A VPS will have very different specs than a bare metal cloud server. That said, some features do cut across most types of web hosting providers.
Bandwidth. How much data you can transfer to and from your website.
Storage. You need to store your files, customer data and media somewhere.
SSL Certificates. This puts the “s” on the end of HTTP and encrypts data transfers.
Security. Tools such as two-factor authentication, zero-trust protocols and DDoS protections help prevent cyberattacks.
Backups. Ransomware, natural disasters or even an intern tripping over a power cord can tank your website. Backups help you recover quickly.
Support. You need someone to turn to when things go wrong. Even with your own IT team, sometimes you need the help of someone with physical access to the servers.
Hosts on our list stand out in these features. For example, Kinsta’s determined support team, TMDHosting’s
security features and DreamHost’s strong uptime guarantee.
Value
Sometimes, cheap really is cheap, and you have to pay a little more for quality. Value is that fine point balancing cost, product features and product quality. Providers on our list offer reasonable values, but many require paying for one to four years upfront to realize that balance.
Not every business can afford large chunk payments and must look at the best value for monthly payment plans.
For overall value, Hostwinds, TMDHosting and Namecheap pull together strong combinations of features compared to costs when looking at monthly billing plans.
Customer Service
Even if you have a great tech team, there are times you need customer support. Billing errors occur, issues with the control panel pop up or there’s a tech issue with the physical servers. Being able to reach someone quickly at your web host can mean the difference between no downtime and thousands of dollars in lost sales.
For quick customer service response times, look at hosts such as Kinsta, Mochahost and Hostinger.
Portability
Even if you love your web host’s services, there may come a time when you need to move your website. Companies are sold, terms change or you might outgrow the hosting offerings. Portability means your website files are yours and can be migrated to a new host.
For the best portability, look for cPanel plans from hosts such as Mochahost, TMDHosting and Namecheap.
Scalability
Regardless of your business type, most of us are planning for some amount of company growth. As companies grow and website demands grow, especially e-commerce businesses, you’ll need more bandwidth and eventually to move from shared hosting to something like VPS where you can increase or decrease computing power on the fly.
For scalability with stronger hosting types, consider hosts such as IONOS, DreamHost and Hostwinds.

Types of Web Hosting
All web hosting is renting space on someone else’s computer or series of computers. These computers, called servers, can host one customer or many customers. How the resources for each server are allocated and the control a customer has over the server setup is determined by the type of web hosting service.
Shared Hosting
Shared web hosting is what most SMBs use in the beginning. While other types of hosting can be cheaper, shared hosting is the cheapest without heavy tech demands from the customer. Shared hosting places many customers and websites on the same server and hard drive. Think of shared hosting as a hostel.
Virtual Private Server (VPS) Hosting
A step up in data partitioning and security, VPS hosting is more like an apartment building than a hostel. You still share a server with many other customers, but instead of everyone’s data dumped together on a hard drive, the storage is partitioned, and you have dedicated resources from the server, so a neighboring website can’t hog all the bandwidth and slow your website. VPS is usually the next step after shared hosting.
Cloud Hosting
Things can get a bit muddy with cloud hosting. It’s all storing and serving data across multiple servers. However, while traditional cloud hosting gives you more control and means paying for a set amount of resources used per instance (a resource being used by a process), some hosts advertise shared cloud hosting.
Shared cloud hosting is just shared hosting using cloud servers. Full cloud hosting can be billed with a flat monthly minimum plus usage or pay-as-you-go usage. Cloud hosting has more technical requirements than shared or VPS hosting. To continue my housing analogy, traditional cloud hosting would be a bit like traveling from hotel to hotel, where you only pay when using a room and for how fancy the room is.
Dedicated Server Hosting
Dedicated hosting can be thought of as a house. You are the only tenant on the server and have control over how the server is set up. This type of hosting provides far more control and security but does require more technical expertise from the customer.
Managed Hosting, Unmanaged Hosting and Managed Servers
For most hosting types, you can choose between managed hosting and unmanaged hosting, although not every host offers managed hosting. Managed hosting means that the host handles some of the backend technical tasks for you, such as software updates and installations, security monitoring and server management.
However, that’s not to be confused with managed servers. In some cases, you can have unmanaged hosting on managed servers. Server management deals with the server itself, while managed hosting deals with the servers and your website(s). The levels of management tasks vary widely by host, plans and hosting type.
How Much Does Web Hosting Cost?
Website hosting costs vary by features, how servers are optimized, server resources, service and the type of hosting. Shared hosting is generally the cheapest option for most customers, although it often isn’t the most cost-effective for server resources, security and performance.
Similarly, while cloud hosting can be cheaper in raw dollar totals in some situations, the technical requirements and complexity of pricing make it untenable for many SMBs without a tech team at their disposal.

Which Web Host Is Best for Your Business?
In the final analysis, which web host you choose will depend on your unique needs. While some points—including storage, speed, customer service, security and scalability—will be important to consider in every situation, it’s those unique characteristics of your business that will make the final call between a good host and the right web host for you.
For example, these are three common sets of situations SMBs run into:
If you have limited technical experience, choose a managed web host such as TMDHosting or Kinsta.
For a shoestring budget, look for a host with low monthly billing options, such as Namecheap or Hostinger.
If you already have a website but want to move to a more fully featured host, consider a host such as Mochahost or Namecheap that offers free migration.
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
How do I know if my website is portable?
When you have access to the files, most websites created through a CMS such as WordPress or Joomla are portable. Portability means you aren’t locked into a specific web host and can migrate your site later. Websites made with host-specific website builders generally don’t give you access to the design files so those can’t be packed up and walked away with.
How do I migrate a website to a new host?
Migrating a website to a new host varies greatly depending on how your website was built, what host you are leaving and which host you are moving to. Websites built with website builders generally can’t be migrated. Websites built with CMS platforms such as WordPress are generally movable, but it could be a manual process, automated with tools from the new host or a white glove migration where the new host’s team completes the migration for you.
What is the cheapest way to host a website?
It is possible to build a free website and have free hosting. The cheapest way to host a website is to use either a free website builder with included hosting or a CMS such as WordPress.org paired with free hosting. However, there are also more fully featured low-cost hosting options available that are more suitable for businesses.
Do I need a hosting plan for every website I have?
Some web hosting companies have plans that include multiple domains and websites, but it varies between web hosts. Shared plans generally have the strictest restrictions, while VPS, Cloud and Dedicated plans have more flexibility.
Can I host multiple landing pages on one web hosting plan?
How you host multiple landing pages depends on whether you are using a top-level domain (TLD) for each or using subdomains. A stand-alone TLD counts as another stand-alone website, and web hosting plans vary on how many they allow. For subdomains (example.yourdomainname.com), many (not all) plans include unlimited subdomains.
Can I host my own website?
Yes, you can self-host your website on your own servers. However, the complexity, cost of setup, continued maintenance requirements and regulatory issues in some cases make it an undesirable option for most SMBs. Most will find it more helpful to sign up with an established web hosting company.
