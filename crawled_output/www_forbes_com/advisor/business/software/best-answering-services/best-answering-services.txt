Answering services handle business calls on your behalf, recording details about the caller and interaction. This saves you time while ensuring customers reach a real-life virtual receptionist whenever they dial your business number. Since providers charge per-minute rates and let you choose when to forward your business calls, you typically save money over a full-time call center or customer service staff.I tested, researched and compared 18 answering service solutions to determine which are best for small businesses and narrowed down the list to the top 10. I found Specialty Answering Service the best value with its low starting cost and per-minute rate, but other providers stand out for different reasons. Answer Connect works well for bundling live chat service with virtual receptionist capabilities, and Posh offers great flexibility with its mobile app. Check out our list below for a full breakdown of the best answering services of 2025.

Expert Take
Specialty Answering Service (SAS) is simple to use, well-rounded and offers the best pricing of any answering service I’ve tried. I’m a fan of its web-based portal, which acts as a hub for data reports, call history, usage tracking and everything customizable. You can leave notes on calls to follow up with SAS’s receptionists, provide virtual receptionists with FAQs and check any appointments your customers have booked through the service. SAS also offers excellent virtual receptionist scripting tools, such as a drag-and-drop script design tool that you can use to visualize and test conversation paths.
The mobile app lets you send updates to your call center and check on missed calls, and the service forwards all messages you receive via email or SMS.
While most other answering services only offer voice and live chat, Specialty Answering Service can also serve your customers via social media and email. If you’re seeking a full contact center service, SAS is a cost-effective option considering its low price. Since there’s no setup fee and the per-minute rates are so low, I’d recommend it as a cost-effective option overall for any small business.
Specialty Answering Service’s script-building tool visualizes and maps out conversation paths you’d like virtual receptionists to use with customers.

Expert Take
While most providers separate voice answering services and voice chat into distinct packages, AnswerConnect bundles the channels into its service. This provides your business with 24/7 availability on both channels, with agents who can capture leads, gather caller information from forms and resolve customer queries based on FAQs you provide. The solution connects to CRM systems like Salesforce and Zendesk, so this information automatically updates your customer profiles and contact history.
I was especially impressed by AnswerConnect’s appointment scheduling and integrations. Your customers can schedule appointments through live chat or voice, and since AnswerConnect syncs with many calendar apps, these appointments automatically populate your schedule at no extra charge.
If you anticipate high inbound call or chat volumes, AnswerConnect is a good option. However, if you don’t expect to meet 200 minutes of answering service usage, you’re better off with a cheaper option like Specialty Answering Service.
AnswerConnect’s desktop app dashboard and notes make it easy to gather contact information and details from all calls and messages the agents take.

HelloSells combines inbound and outbound answering services and live chat, emphasizing lead capturing and sales. I like the customized approach that it allows you to design. When setting up your account, you have a consultation where HelloSells helps you create a script and webform. You choose how you’d like agents to handle calls, what they should say and the information they collect.
The service can embed a live chat widget into your website with diverse capabilities. Agents call leads back when they submit a web form via live chat. They can screen leads, schedule appointments and even accept payments through the Square integration.
The mobile app is easy to use and lets you set your availability with the click of a button, choosing when you’d like to handle calls and when you want to forward them. You can access your call and chat history, and the app notifies you of each note agents leave about interactions that took place while you were unavailable.
I’d recommend HelloSells for teams anticipating high call and chat volumes, especially those focused on capturing leads and booking appointments.
The HelloSells mobile app makes it easy to set your availability, toggling the answering services on and off as needed.

Expert Take
Posh’s answering service centers around voice calling and SMS, but not live chat. Starting at $65 and $2.25 per additional minute, it offers middle-of-the-road pricing but provides flexibility for companies anticipating low call volumes.
My favorite thing about Posh is the simplicity and comprehensiveness of its mobile app. Similar to HelloSells, Posh’s mobile app makes it easy to turn answering services on and off as needed with a button. You can provide quick instructions for your receptionist, such as what to tell callers. It’s easy to catch up on what you missed when you log into the app, as each call’s record is thorough, with caller details and the notes that your receptionist leaves.
You can also text customers, make outbound calls and set up a voicemail for your business number through the Posh app—and you can access these features even when you’re not actively using the answering service. The desktop app is feature-rich too, with visual analytics displaying your call activity by day and time.
Given its user-friendly mobile app and low starting cost, I’d recommend Posh for teams focused on simplicity and having an answering service that’s easy to toggle on and off.
Posh’s mobile app lets you easily turn answering services on and off, with the option to leave detailed instructions for virtual receptionists.

Posh Virtual Receptionists is well-regarded by users for its professional and responsive virtual receptionist services that significantly enhance customer experiences. Clients appreciate the service’s efficiency, personalized attention and the ease of the onboarding process, with many highlighting the friendliness and competence of the receptionists and their ability to adapt services to specific business needs. However, some users have noted issues such as occasional billing concerns and missed calls, though these are less frequently reported compared to the overwhelmingly positive feedback about Posh’s value and its positive impact on business operations.

Expert Take
Go Answer’s answering services allow you to choose between voice-only virtual receptionists and web chat, but they don’t offer mixed-channel plans. The virtual receptionist service centers around a web app with a solid variety of features. You can create custom scripts to guide virtual receptionists, who record details about each caller and email or text you when you’ve received a call.
Go Answer agents are HIPAA-certified, meaning they securely handle sensitive information in healthcare industries. I also like that Go Answer offers bilingual customer support at no extra cost, since many alternatives charge you extra for services from bilingual receptionists.
Another thing I appreciate about Go Answer is that each account gets a dedicated virtual receptionist. This person is a central point of contact for you to follow up with receptionists and get feedback about your customer service strategy.
At $1.75 per minute, it’s also one of the cheaper answering services we tested. I’d recommend Go Answer for companies that prioritize having a reliable direct contact who oversees their answering service strategy.

PATLive offers virtual receptionist answering services for voice only or live chat, but not mixed plans. You can access the service through mobile or web apps. You can use your preexisting business number as the virtual receptionist number or PATLive can provide a business number based anywhere in the U.S and a voicemail inbox, which is a less common feature.
The thing that I appreciate most about PATLive is the breadth of capabilities its agents provide for people who call your number. PATLive receptionists can collect leads, record new clients, take messages, make sales and facilitate payments, schedule meetings and register event attendees. It’s a good choice if you’re temporarily using an answering service for an upcoming event or if you want to connect an e-commerce platform to enable your answering service to make sales. The service integrates with several popular e-commerce platforms that alternatives don’t have, such as Squarespace, Etsy, Wix and Shopify.
The main drawback to PATLive is that it’s much more expensive than most alternatives.
PATLive’s desktop app provides a simple overview of your calls and chat messages, with details about each interaction.

Ruby’s answering service centers around a user-friendly and modern mobile app. The interface feels clean, pleasant and easy to use. You can set your status by clicking a button and instantly have your calls answered, with the option to leave additional instructions as needed for receptionists. Ruby lets you choose a local or toll-free business number or use your own, and you can make calls directly from either one using the mobile app. The receptionists can handle a wide breadth of services, like scheduling, new client additions and accepting payments.
What stands out to me most about Ruby is that the receptionists and managers give you feedback on how to improve your inbound call-handling strategy. The feedback is based on their impression of how the calls go and what customers say.
The main drawback, however, is that Ruby is expensive. It’s only worth the cost for companies prioritizing collaborative feedback from receptionists and the convenience of a user-friendly mobile app.
Ruby’s mobile app lets you set your availability status, quickly view activity and make calls from your business number.

Overall, user opinions on Ruby’s answering services and virtual receptionist products are mixed. Many users appreciate the professional, friendly and helpful nature of Ruby’s staff, praising the service for improving their business operations and providing a competent interface for customer interactions. However, there are issues with billing practices, technical difficulties and inconsistent service quality, with several users expressing dissatisfaction and concerns about the cost and handling of calls. While the service has been noted for its professionalism and effectiveness, repeated complaints about expensive pricing and customer service problems have contributed to a less positive overall perception.

MAP Communications is a well-priced answering service with above-average security features. While the service doesn’t offer a mobile app, the web portal offers well-rounded functionality: you can track call activity, contact details and check the notes left by virtual receptionists. The team works closely with you when setting up your account to learn about your business and determine how you plan to serve your customers: form completion, lead qualification, multilingual service or appointment scheduling.
While many alternatives only offer HIPAA compliance to protect your customers’ sensitive health data, MAP Communications adds HITRUST certification, which protects sensitive data across industries including legal, education and health services. I was also impressed by MAP’s outbound calling services. Agents follow up with leads, schedule meetings and administer surveys over the phone, helping you gather customer feedback from users in any time zone.
Best of all, MAP Communications is among the most cost-effective answering services on our list. It’s a good option for teams that want to take advantage of outbound phone surveys as part of their answering service plan.

Expert Take
Smith.ai’s answering service offers real-human or AI-based receptionists, letting you choose how personalized you’d like your service to be. The AI-based offering is unlike any other option on our list and offers unique functionality like call transcription and summaries for all inbound calls. These transcripts and summaries enable more in-depth oversight and reviews, helping you understand why customers call your business. The AI can also handle basic capabilities like lead screening, gathering basic customer info and appointment scheduling.
Unlike other providers, Smith.ai charges by the call, which can be inefficient for short calls but may save you money if the inbound calls take more than a couple of minutes. I think Smith’s AI service could be a feasible option for companies looking to extract basic customer information and handle simple tasks like appointment scheduling.
However, the provider’s real-human virtual receptionists are way too expensive, costing a ridiculous $10 per call, so if you want personalized interactions, you’re better off with an alternative.
Smith.ai’s call recording and summaries let you review each interaction in more detail.

Expert Take
Moneypenny’s answering services offer voice-based virtual receptionists with a lot of choice about how advanced you want your features to be. The Essential plans include basic features like bilingual answering, custom FAQ answers for the receptionists and no limit to the amount of customer information that your receptionists record.
The costlier Personalized plans add advanced features like CRM integrations and higher-level services like appointment scheduling, custom forms, order processing and payment acceptance. These are valuable features, but I’m disappointed that Moneypenny charges extra for them, as many alternatives include these capabilities in the normal feature set.
I was impressed with Moneypenny’s desktop app. It includes the regular features like checking call details and notes, but the analytics are especially impressive. The dashboard has several visual displays that chart things like which agents customers request, the average call duration and the most frequent reasons for customer calls. If you’re looking for insights about your callers’ activity and behaviors, Moneypenny is a smart choice.
Moneypenny’s desktop apps have several visual displays providing insights about your callers, their behaviors and the reasons they call.

Methodology
To create the rankings and list above, we compared 18 answering services. While evaluating each service, we researched everything: We explored the desktop and mobile apps, studied the available services and checked out the features.
Next, we compared each provider based on 63 data points we deemed essential for answering services. The data points included pricing, channel availability, scripts, integrations, etc. We divided these data points into six general categories, assigning each category a weight based on its importance. Each provider’s final score reflects the average of its scores across each of the seven categories.
Here’s a quick breakdown of the categories we used to determine our rankings:

How to Choose the Best Answering Service
It’s critical to choose an answering service with the capabilities and customization options to help you serve your customers just how you want to. You want a service that’s communicative, easy to use via desktop and mobile, and that meets your anticipated call volume at a manageable price.
Here’s a more in-depth breakdown of what to consider when selecting an answering service:
Core Answering Service Features
An answering service’s functionality centers around virtual receptionists—real-life agents who take calls on your behalf. When handling your business calls, an answering service’s virtual receptionists offer many call-handling services, including recording customer information, leaving notes about calls, booking appointments and more, as needed by your company. You should also be able to provide instructions and even detailed scripts to guide how the agents interact with your callers.
You should expect the following services from your virtual receptionist:
Desktop and mobile apps: Most answering services offer desktop and mobile apps for you to communicate with receptionists. Desktop apps let you manage scripts, check call logs and view analytics. Some providers’ mobile apps let you toggle receptionist services on and off as needed or provide instructions to receptionists.
Custom scripts and FAQs: Answering services often let you dictate how the receptionists handle your inbound calls. Many providers let you create scripts or dozens of FAQ responses to provide more substantial, valuable interactions for inbound callers.
Web forms for customer details: Some providers let you create chat-based or virtual forms that receptionists or customers themselves can fill out, to help you elicit more details from them.
Email and SMS notifications: Most virtual receptionist services notify you by email or SMS when they’ve handled a call on your behalf. Then you can log into the desktop or mobile app and check the call details.
Notes and messages: Virtual receptionists can leave notes on each of your calls. That way, when you log into the app to check any calls that your service took on your behalf, you’re fully informed of information like the reason for their call, the receptionist who served them, if you need to call back and the contact’s relevant information.
Lead screening: Your answering service should be able to filter qualified leads from your inbound calls and gather their contact information, schedule a call or add them to a campaign list for your sales team or auto dialer system.
Appointment booking: Most answering services integrate with popular calendar apps, letting inbound callers book appointments and meetings through your virtual receptionist.
Order processing: Some answering service providers integrate with e-commerce apps and payment platforms and can facilitate sales and orders on behalf of your business. This service is rarer than appointment booking or lead screening because it requires integrations.
Bilingual services: Most virtual receptionist services employ agents who speak English and Spanish, enabling you to connect with and serve customers without a language barrier.
Specialty Answering Service offers the most dynamic scripting tools to customize how your service interacts with customers. However, PATLive offers the widest variety of services overall, including appointment scheduling, order processing and bonus services like event registration. Smith.ai and Ruby also offer an impressive variety of services and features, including each of those listed above.
Value
The answering service with the best value is the one that allows you to serve the most customers, with the least hassle, at the lowest cost. While this depends on your business needs, I like Speciality Answering Service and MAP Communications as cost-effective options with easy management and a solid breadth of service capabilities. Go Answer is another affordable option and works well if you appreciate having a consistent touchpoint for inquiries you may have for your provider.
Ease of Use
Since one of an answering service’s primary benefits is that it saves you time, you must choose a service that’s easy to implement and manage. You should be able to communicate exactly how you want to handle customer calls, turn call forwarding on and off as needed and easily retrieve call data and insights.
I found Ruby and Posh to offer user-friendly and dynamic mobile apps that allow you to turn answering services on and off as needed, with just a click or two. Moneypenny’s desktop app provides a wealth of visuals and insights that make it easy to view trends and extract value from customer information.
Integrations
Phone answering services integrate with third-party systems like CRM, VoIP service, e-commerce, marketing, calendaring and communication apps. These integrations sync functionality and data across platforms, so your inbound calls automatically populate CRM customer profiles and populate your calendar with scheduled meetings.
HelloSells offers a vast selection of integrations—especially CRM, payment and email marketing apps—making it a great choice for teams focused on sales and marketing. PATLive stands out with its unique e-commerce integrations that allow you to accept payment through a variety of programs like Shopify or Etsy.

The best answering service for your business depends on your budget and how you’d like to serve your customers. If low cost is your main priority, without compromising important capabilities like appointment scheduling and scripting, Specialty Answering Service and MAP Communications are the most cost-effective choices.
AnswerConnect’s bundled plans are a good value for companies seeking to serve customers through both voice and live chat widgets. Posh and Ruby offer user-friendly, mobile-first experiences with the option to toggle services on and off, providing flexibility for companies that typically only need answering services spontaneously or for short periods.
Teams prioritizing customer insights and data should look to Moneypenny and Smith.ai, as Moneypenny excels with detailed analytics dashboards and Smith.ai uniquely includes call transcripts and summaries for all calls.
If marketing and sales are your main focus, I’d recommend PATLive and HelloSells for their diversity of services and e-commerce integrations.
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
What is an answering service?
An answering service is a company that handles your business’ inbound calls on your behalf. You work with your answering service to create scripts and FAQs, customizing how the virtual receptionist responds to your callers. The service records call details and can take action like booking appointments, saving you time.
What are the disadvantages of using an answering service?
The main disadvantage of using an answering service is that it tends to be expensive, with most providers charging around $100 per month and $2 per additional minute. Further, answering services employ virtual receptionists who aren’t part of your company, so you have limited control and oversight over the quality of service they provide to your callers.
How much do answering services cost?
Answering services typically cost anywhere between $1.30 and $4 per minute, while some services are even pricier than this. Some providers let you pay per minute right off the bat, while some require you to subscribe to a monthly allotment of minutes.
