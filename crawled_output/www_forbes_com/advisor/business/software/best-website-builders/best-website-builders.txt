I always recommend working with website builders if you need to DIY a professional-looking website without coding. From your first e-commerce store to a simple informational website acting as a digital business card, website builders bring most types of websites within reach for any budget.
As part of our commitment to data-driven results, we identified dozens of website builders and collected data on features, value and reputation to find the top website builder choices for SMBs. The top choice, the Hostinger website builder, stands out for budget-friendly pricing, strong AI tools and an included e-commerce tool suite on some plans.

Expert Take
Hostinger offers a great website builder that doesn’t get as much attention as it should due to a lack of free trial or free plan options. While most website builders offer some way to try out the product without cost, Hostinger opts for a generous 30-day money-back guarantee instead. While I’ve never had a problem getting a refund under that plan, it is off-putting for many when compared to free test options with no card needed elsewhere.
Hostinger’s AI-powered builder offers plenty of power and is easy to use for any skill level. Plus, e-commerce is available on every plan. Hosting choices are another huge plus for Hostinger. While most website builder hosting plans are severely limited without big price jumps, Hostinger’s affordable plans offer generous resource options plus a dedicated IP, which is important for various compliance regulations in many industries.
Hostinger allows you to use different website platforms on a single hosting account.
Monthly pricing plans are about average in cost, but the real savings are in paying for a year or more up front. For example, the highest-tier plan, the Cloud Startup, is $27.99 monthly but only $19.99 per month if you can pay four years upfront. That’s less than competitors like Wix’s first e-commerce-capable website builder plan.

Like most website builders, customers often push the limits of its capabilities, and reviews reflect that well with Hostinger’s website builder. While this site builder is flexible, the lack of a free plan or free trial may lead to heavy customer expectations. That said, many customers still praise affordable pricing, the easy-to-use interface and quick website setup. As with most website builders, some complain that it can’t be migrated to another host.

Testing Insights
I’m not generally a fan of AI-powered website builders, but the Hostinger builder was surprisingly good. I also loved that you have options beyond the website builder in the hosting plans. You can have up to 100 websites on a single plan, and you can mix and match. So, if you want a WordPress website and a website builder-created website, that’s perfectly fine. It’s a flexibility I’ve never seen handled so well anywhere else.

Expert Take
“Limited” sums up the customization ability of Squarespace’s website builder, but there are still strong reasons to use it, especially if e-commerce or blog monetization is your goal. Most of the design limitations work in the favor of beginners, limiting the risk of being caught in a never-ending loop of small design choices to make and adjust. Professionally created color and font presets, along with AI design, help make quick work of getting your business online.
Squarespace’s biggest flex is its user-friendly online sales setup and blog monetization tools integrated into the website builder. In fact, those tools are strong enough that they topped my best blogging platform list.
It’s a great option for creators looking to take more control over their content instead of hoping the social media platform they use won’t disappear overnight, as TikTok briefly did, or take down an account for unspecified reasons. The easy blog creation features let you set up online courses, subscription boxes and even video tutorials behind a paywall.
Squarespace has one of the easiest blog paywalls and content management systems among popular website builders.
I do recommend spending time going through the templates before choosing. Some are pretty dated, but you can find good choices if you take a little extra time to scroll instead of just grabbing the first thing that looks tolerable.

Users generally appreciate Squarespace’s templates and user-friendly design tools for simple sites. However, domain management and frequently unresponsive customer service tend to temper positive feelings. Customers also complain of limitations in design features and the overall cost structure.

Blogging tools were the highlight of testing for me, and template aesthetics were the low point. I was really impressed with how simple the blog setup and monetization tools were within the website builder.
However, when testing different browsers, it seemed that it works best on Chrome, and using other browsers such as Firefox and Microsoft Edge led to odd glitches, like “exit to content creation” failing when trying to move between design and content.

Expert Take
WordPress.com is a hosting plan partnership with the WordPress.org CMS. It’s designed to make WordPress easier for first-time users and provide a free hosting option. If you’ve never set up a WordPress.org website before, signing up with a hosting provider and suddenly being confronted with cPanel instead of the WordPress dashboard you expected can be daunting. I’ve honestly seen folks break out in tears because they have no idea where to start.
WordPress.com simplifies the process and includes a simple visual builder without the need to install plugins. It’s a great, gentle introduction to working with the WordPress CMS and hosting in general for beginners, and I heartily recommend everyone check out a free account at least once. However, once you get the hang of working with WordPress, you’re probably going to want to migrate to a different WordPress-optimized hosting provider.
WordPress.com locks WordPress.org features depending on your plan. Free plans can’t even adjust colors and fonts freely.
The built-in website builder is very simple and pretty intuitive to use. However, WordPress.com’s hosting plans lock down CMS features at a draconian level while providing no customer support if you pay monthly instead of annually. For example, you can’t even install WordPress plugins (which are a major draw of WordPress) until the $40-per-month Business plan.

Confusing WordPress.com for WordPress.org seems to be at the heart of many of the complaints surrounding WordPress.com. While users like having a visual website builder and simplified hosting experience, the lack of customization options and limits on which WordPress CMS features are available by plan lead to frustration. Customers bemoan a lack of customer support on monthly billed plans, the still steep WordPress learning curve and costs compared to server resources.

Testing Insights
Using the WordPress.com builder is great for beginners, but if you’ve ever looked at other proprietary builders, even very simple ones like Google Sites, you’ll be struck quickly by how restricted functionality is on most WordPress.com plans.
Themes, e-commerce features, plugin availability and even simple changes like color and fonts are locked down on free and low-cost plans. In testing, that was the biggest frustration; anytime I tested one of the more popular lower-cost plans, I lost so much functionality that it was incredibly difficult to manage even simple tasks at times.

Expert Take
High transaction fees and limited e-commerce tools make Strikingly a poor e-commerce choice, but for other types of websites, such as simple informational sites or personal blogs, this builder brings its “A” game.
With one of the most frequently updated and maintained sets of free templates I’ve seen, combined with strong AI creation tools and easy-to-navigate customization options, Strikingly pulls together a strong set of design features. I’m particularly fond of the mobile action buttons that create quick CTA features on the mobile version of your website to increase engagement.
While features on the free plan are limited, its unlimited number of free websites is a fabulous option for community clubs, one-time events, school projects, small non-profits and practicing building websites.
Strikingly allows e-commerce on all plans and has some nicely arranged tools like single-page sales tax management.
However, there are so many reports of unauthorized billing and cancellation orders that didn’t go through that I urge caution on paid plans, such as using a prepaid card with only what you need for the current subscription loaded on the card.

Users are fans of the intuitive interface of Strikingly’s site builder and overall love the easy DIY experience of creating a simple website and the high-quality templates. However, there is a near-universal disdain for the billing practices and lack of refund policy. Users often call out unauthorized charges and failed cancellations. Overall, users seem happy with the product, but not the service and billing supporting that product, leading to mixed feelings.

If you aren’t interested in custom coding but want a lot of options on how your website will look, Strikingly is waiting for you. While bigger companies like Wix have larger stables of themes, Strikingly shines in variety and how often themes are updated.
I also loved how few menus were needed to complete most website creation tasks, a great simplification of processes for beginners and those in a time crunch. I wasn’t happy with some of the free plan limits on the number of pages, but the free plan is still a great option for those who don’t have to have a custom domain name.

Expert Take
GoDaddy has put a lot of time and effort into the latest generation of its AI-powered website builder. Targeted at absolute beginners, the goal is for users to let the AI do the design work for them, and for the most part, it succeeds far more than other AI-powered builders.
I also like the included Getty Images limited subscription (on paid plans) and that you can publish your website under a subdomain once your trial runs out (with limited features), even though it isn’t advertised as a free plan. The thorn on the rose is the lackluster underlying hosting and poor customer support.
GoDaddy proves the power of a big advertising budget. Near-viral Super Bowl ads featuring some of the most in-demand Hollywood stars like Walton Goggins help fuel GoDaddy’s name recognition, but not its reputation.
GoDaddy generally prices plans low, but many features require additional costs or are free feature trials with steep renewal fees that can quickly bust your budget.
Possibly because of a shaky reputation, GoDaddy’s website builder usage lags behind that of other builders like Wix. In fact, most of GoDaddy’s market share is as a domain registrar, not a host or website builder, which lends credence to the theory of many initial builder and hosting signups that include domain registration, but customers leave for other hosts soon after.

GoDaddy is the king of mixed sentiment. While many small website owners praise the intuitive and straightforward builder, those sentiments can change on a dime if problems arise. Surprise extra costs, add-on fees, unresponsive customer service and poor website performance problems often quickly turn happy customers into dissatisfied ones. Other concerns about the website builder include SEO limits and mobile optimization shortfalls.

While it changes the workflow from the old pick a template and adjust style, the builder controls for customization are actually a pleasant surprise and not what I’ve come to expect from GoDaddy over the years. It really is a welcome major change in functionality and creating a website is quick and easy.
Unfortunately, the lack of responsive customer service hasn’t changed, with users reporting many requests going unanswered for weeks or answers not solving concerns. Likewise, pricing is still based on an add-on cost model that drastically increases overall pricing in the long run.

Expert Take
One of the best e-commerce platforms available, Shopify is to e-commerce what Google is to search. While powerful and popular, it isn’t perfect. Shopify’s website builder is relatively simple for basic store setup, with a good AI helpbot guiding you through each step (you can go off-script if you prefer) and a sidebar editing system rather than drag and drop that beginners will likely find less overwhelming. I also like the integrated fee photo library that gets shop owners started with background imagery.
However, it’s the sheer number of e-commerce tools and options that make Shopify powerful. Thousands of third-party integrations, advanced features on some plans, industry-specific plan options and the option of a $5 simple shop introductory plan without the full website builder for social media selling gives businesses of all sizes and types the functionality they need.
Shopify’s AI helpbot guides you through the website creation process, but you can skip steps as well.
Pricing and difficulties with DIY setup of advanced functions are the biggest downsides for Shopify’s website builder. Every shop owner I personally know using Shopify is constantly running into additional costs on top of already pricey monthly subscription fees. The ability to scale to enterprise-level is there, but you’ll pay enterprise prices for it.

Shopify is a popular platform and many customers praise it for ease of use and the thousands of third-party integration options to increase the e-commerce capabilities further and offer scaling options. However, customer service, billing practices, transaction fees designed to push users to Shopify’s native payment system and overall costs are sore points for many. Others also mention the difficulty in customizing more advanced features without hiring help.

Core functions of Shopify websites operate effectively, and the setup process runs smoothly. Absolute beginners can create an online store fairly quickly without needing to consult help files regularly. Third-party integrations install well for the most part, and basic website customization works well with just a few annoying issues.
For example, if you get the orange “enable cookies to design” warning box, it kicks you out of editing to a bland “coming soon” webpage placeholder to resolve the cookie issue with no direct link back to the design page. Shopify is also fond of add-on costs, and sometimes working in the builder feels more like a sales funnel to another plan than building an e-commerce website.

Every time I read the name, I think of late-night camp horror show “Svengoolie” (think Elvira but punnier), but Simvoly is a beautifully done website builder with plenty of flexibility and some great automation options I rarely find in SMB website builders.
Although a few come with extra costs, features like A/B page testing (email automations that allow for if/then action chains), strong redirect tools, built-in cookie acceptance/decline features and plenty of store page layouts are welcome changes to the bare bones features many builders offer. I’m especially fond of the email event chains that take the hassle out of tracking how long it’s been since you contacted someone.
Simvoly’s website builder has easy arrangement, customization and block adjustment tools.
I also love the abundance of tutorial videos and how well they are integrated with the website creation process, so you aren’t left guessing about how Simvoly is organized. Overall, it’s one of the more flexible builders I’ve seen when you take all of the extra abilities like CRM, funnels, white-label reselling and strong design tools together overall.

Simvoly has an overall good reputation as a feature-rich site builder with easy-to-use design tools, vibrant drag-and-drop editing and strong customer support. Customers also appreciate the affordable pricing, while they aren’t as enthusiastic about its less-than-stellar ability to handle complex website builds. Mobile editing is especially a topic of concern for adjustments on the go. However, most users are happy that the platform is continuing to update and work on issues raised by customers, especially in comparison to less responsive platforms.

Most of my testing with Simvoly was repeating, “Oh, didn’t expect them to offer that.” It also made a good impression early on when it let me click and drag block sizes without having to delete items and add them back to change configurations, as is surprisingly common with some other builders. Advanced features will be appreciated by agencies wanting to move away from WordPress and the discounts for resellers are deep.
Other than slightly confusing pricing plans, my biggest gripe with Simvoly is that it publishes your website the moment you create it. Because of that, I strongly recommend not connecting a custom domain name or customizing the subdomain name until you are ready for others to see it.

WordPress isn’t for everyone and Duda offers a great alternative to website developers to provide white-label hosting services with a powerful WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get), custom-code-enabled builder. For custom plans, a REST-based API with JSON responses is also available. It’s a bit like Wix on steroids and a Red Bull.
Even if you aren’t an agency, the extremely flexible WYSIWYG visual editor takes the preset shackles off and lets you express your creativity. While it can easily overwhelm a beginner, if you are tired of the constraints from other builders, Duda is a great place to stretch your wings. Just be aware that the initial learning curve can be a bit steep, and it is easy to get lost in the design without any fencing to keep you from playing with some of the behind-the-scenes controls.
Duda keeps agencies in mind from the start of website creation.
If you need added functions, an app store is available, although not as robust as some other builders. I also like that Duda’s website builder is backed by Amazon AWS cloud hosting, so reliability and uptime generally aren’t a worry, especially with a promised 99.999% uptime.

While lesser known, Duda is highly praised for user-friendly controls and the flexibility offered to web design agencies and indie web developers. Drag-and-drop editing, mobile-responsive sites and good SEO tools are favorite positives for Duda. However, others raise concerns over the lack of unique design options, pricing structure and website performance issues in spite of being powered by Amazon AWS cloud servers.

My first thought with Duda was, “Ohh, there’s no training wheels here. Cool! What can I break?” I love trying to break things in testing because that’s what happens in the real world: You try something new and the digital gremlins find you.
While there are plenty of ways to get yourself in trouble (placeholders will probably be the first thing to trip you up initially), and the platform doesn’t hold your hand, it was surprisingly hard to actually break anything. The possibilities are phenomenal if you put in the time and work. It truly can support agency needs when you are trying to avoid WordPress.

Expert Take
While there are plenty of templates and you can start from scratch with Dorik, it’s worth trying out the AI website builder just to watch it work. Instead of just staring at a loading screen, you watch the site as the AI builds it, right down to watching it add the admittedly flowery and a bit pretentious text.
The overall result of the AI build is surprisingly good and a nice starting point for building your website. Editing is fairly straightforward, although the AI’s tendency to label every container in the navigator with “container” instead of a relevant name is rather rage-inducing if you have more than a couple of containers on a page. You can rename them, but it feels like a step the AI could have handled.
Features like unlimited storage and bandwidth are great to find with website builder hosting, and SEO tools are surprisingly robust as well. For example, custom schema is a valuable feature often overlooked in builder tools and will be especially beneficial for agencies with the expertise to utilize it effectively. However, it is important to note that the promised free stock images are just a connection to Unsplash.
Dorik’s website builder allows easy access for container editing with a simple right-click.
Pricing is another interesting point with Dorik. Annual billing or lifetime purchase are the only options, and the difference between the two is almost negligible. For most users who choose Dorik, a lifetime plan will probably make the most sense. Even though it’s a few hundred dollars up front, you won’t have recurring costs other than add-ons like domains and user analytics.

Dorik and its Dorik AI website builder generally get high marks for user friendliness, an easy-to-use drag-and-drop style interface, quick page layouts and affordability with a lifetime plan costing almost the same as a one-year subscription. Powerful SEO tools and some integrations are also welcome. However, the lackluster e-commerce features and the initial upfront cost cause concern among others, leading to overall mixed sentiment across customer segmentation.
Pros & Cons
Unlimited storage and bandwidth on free plans
Allows custom schema for SEO
Offers a lifetime plan one-time payment option
Many agency features only available with custom-quoted plans
Weak native e-commerce tools and mostly relies on integration with other platforms
White label documentation and billing only available under custom-quoted plans

I’m normally not a fan of AI, but Dorik’s builder usually gives you a pretty good starting point. The editing controls are pretty good, with right-click to access and a navigator menu, which are welcome features since AI container stacking isn’t the most organized. I was also fond of the option to regenerate the AI results and how easy it was to build a wireframe page arrangement.
The only significant glitch I encountered was that clicking the “X” to close a menu on the right side of the screen often activated the scroll bar. This caused the screen to jump around erratically, almost as if it were being electrified. The end result is that closing the menu is nearly impossible unless you have enough caffeine in your system that you could thread a running sewing machine.

Expert Take
Square’s website builder, Square Online, is limited, but it is designed to get you online quickly without a lot of fiddling with settings. If you want deep customization, it isn’t the builder for you. It is undoubtedly one of the easiest ways to launch an e-commerce store without any upfront investment, seamlessly integrating online and in-person sales.
Most of the builder process is straightforward, although the free plan is very limited in template options. Beyond the free plan, design options are more robust, and beginners will find the preset color and font options (customizable if needed) helpful timesavers. Plus, AI tools help fill in content fairly quickly. SEO tools are about average, but don’t include deep controls like some other website builders.
Square Online’s preset color and font sets give a quick, professionally designed starting point for your website.
Payment processing is limited with Square Online. While you can accept Apply Pay, Google Pay, Cash App Pay, Afterpay and other specialty payment types, you must use Square’s payment processing service. You can’t connect a third-party processor like Stripe.

Square Online users generally love the simplicity, user-friendly design tools and easy integration with Square payments. They appreciate the free plan; however, they find the ongoing transaction fees after upgrading to a paid account less favorable. Users also like how easily Square Online blends in-person and online store capabilities. However, a lack of custom coding, reports of website instability and the lack of payment processor choice are frequent concerns.

I don’t think I’ll ever get over Square effectively dismantling Weebly, as they served very different use cases, but if you accept Square Online for what it is, and not a Weebly alternative, it gets the job done.
Controls are straightforward and intuitive until you hit one of the seemingly random missing features. That is, simple common features like moving a design block on the page or adjusting form fields are missing without any seeming rhyme or reason to what is included and what isn’t. Similarly, while you can design in mobile view (and I recommend that), you can’t make manual adjustments between mobile and desktop versions for custom optimization.

Hands-On Testing
What Is a Website Builder?
A website builder is software that allows a user to create a website with no coding required. Website builders act much like a computer operating system. For example, where Windows and Apple’s macOS create a visual interface for working with your home computer, a website builder platform handles the coding needed behind the scenes while you work with visual icons and text prompts.
Website builders are a type of content management system (CMS) that uses prebuilt themes or templates that give users shortcuts to creating a well-designed website layout. Some builders use a drag-and-drop interface where you click on an element and drag it somewhere on your screen, while others use a block-based system with less arrangement flexibility but more user assistance in the building process.
Types of Sites You Can Make With a Website Builder
Almost any type of website can be made with a website builder. However, not every builder is fit for every website. Different website builders focus on different types of websites and use cases. For example, some, like Ghost, are focused on blog creation and monetization, while others, like Zoho Commerce, are primarily meant for e-commerce.
Website Builder Features
Like CMSs such as WordPress, many website builders include plugin capabilities, generally called third-party extensions or third-party integrations. However, unlike WordPress, most website builders are not portable, meaning you can’t migrate your website from one host to another.
Features vary widely by website builder. SEO tools, email marketing, e-commerce, customer management, animations, form creation and social media integration are just some of the functions that may or may not be present or vary wildly in strength of the tools.
Website Builder Hosting
While you may be used to finding your own hosting for a CMS like WordPress or Joomla, website builders generally come with included shared hosting plans. With very rare exceptions, you can’t choose a different type of hosting plan, such as a VPS or dedicated server, for your website builder website. Likewise, you usually can’t migrate to another host later.
As an all-in-one solution, you also rarely have access to cPanel or other control panels for your website builder hosting. This often limits control over features such as backups and databases.
Because of these limits, choosing a website builder platform that offers excellent hosting resources is often more important than the builder itself.
How To Choose the Best Website Builder
Picking the best website builder for you depends on what you need. If you just need a simple online business card informational site, then one of the best free website builders can probably serve you well. However, for e-commerce, portfolios or other detailed website types, you’ll probably need a less restrictive builder with better hosting. Look for a good mix of price, hosting, features, ease of use and support.
Essential Website Builder Features
I love that website builders have such a wide variety of features. It can make it harder to compare platforms sometimes, but it lets you buy just what you need and not pay for what you don’t. It’s a lot like car shopping. If you are looking for a daily commuter vehicle, gas mileage and a bright paint job for visibility in heavy traffic might top your list. Conversely, if you need a work truck, you want torque, towing capacity and tool storage. No one vehicle (or website builder) fits everyone’s needs.
When shopping for a website builder, look at factors like:
No code visual editing. The idea of a website builder is to make creating a website easier. The core of that is visual editing. While not all visual editors will be a true WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) editor, each one should have a visual interface of some kind as its primary editing tool.
Themes and Templates. Even with visual design tools eliminating the need for coding, starting from prebuilt themes and templates saves time and gives you access to the work of professional web designers for a better result.
Customization features. Some website builders restrict theme customization to preset color palettes and font collections. Others limit where you can position text and images on the page or even what size those assets can be. While more limits often mean keeping you out of the weeds design-wise, it can also be frustrating if you are trying to match brand guidelines.
Image management: Photos, videos and even GIFs can improve visual interest and engagement on your website. However, you need a way to keep everything organized and optimized. Look for builders with strong gallery features, in-platform editing (if you don’t have your own photo editing software), high storage limits and stock imagery subscriptions.
SEO tools. There are a lot of types of SEO. On-page SEO, off-page SEO and technical SEO are just some of the types involved. On-page SEO tools, those to help you optimize your content, such as meta descriptions, alt text and heading tags (H2, H3, etc.) are common in website builders. Off-page SEO is mostly building backlinks and is not controlled by your builder. Technical SEO tools are the least likely to be offered by website builders, with robots.txt and sitemaps being the limit of most builders’ technical SEO controls.
Third-party integrations. These may be called integrations, apps, extensions or plugins, but the theory is the same. These connect your website to outside software to add more functions. While open source software such as WordPress.org generally allows you free rein to source integrations from almost anywhere, most website builder platforms use proprietary software and limit your choices.
Custom coding options. While the point of a website builder is to avoid being required to code, having the option of including custom code greatly expands customization capability for later on as your site’s needs grow.
Ease of Use
No one wants to waste time fighting with an uncooperative interface. While all of the website builders on our list are generally well designed with easy onboarding walkthroughs, what’s intuitive for one will be frustrating for someone else. Finding the match between your style and the website builder is important. Likewise, detailed help files and readily reachable customer support are crucial in keeping website builders easy to use.
For example, the powerful Wix builder didn’t make my list this round because of continuing issues with help files being hard to find, out of date, pointing to the wrong builder version (Classic and Studio) and Studio builder documentation being woefully skimpy.
For fast e-commerce setup without frills, Squarespace has a great streamlined process. However, Simvoly and Hostinger offer more options for easy-to-use deep design features.
Customer Support
Customer support and technical support are your bridge between the software and you. From billing issues to helping you navigate unexpected downtime, you need quick access to well-trained and knowledgeable support specialists. In general, I find that the current state of customer support is lacking. Most SMBs I work with have better luck reaching quick resolutions using the technical support ticketing system or email over the generalist customer support through live chat with most platforms.
Simvoly, Strikingly and Hostinger tend to have fairly quick customer response times.
E-commerce
E-commerce is popular, but it is far from the only type of website. With over a billion websites in the world, there are plenty of types to go around. Whether built from scratch, built with one of the best CMS platforms or built with a website builder, functions vary widely. While many generalist website builders offer e-commerce, there are also specialized e-commerce platforms available.
Shopify, Squarespace and Square Online are designed primarily for e-commerce.
Security
Because of requirements like PCI-DSS and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) compliance, e-commerce capable website builders often have some of the strongest security. Desired security features include 2FA, user management, DDoS and malware detection, ISO 27001 and engineering safeguards, SSL certificates and firewalls.
Shopify and Duda both include many security features.
Reputation
Web hosting and builder reputations are particularly important but sometimes hard to evaluate. The vast majority of website hosting provider reviews refer to the cheapest shared hosting plan available, not higher-cost hosting or the website builders themselves. As such, star ratings on aggregator sites like TrustPilot and G2 may be skewed negatively by products other than website builders. In those cases, looking at customer service and technical support reviews is often the most helpful, as they give an overall picture and are relevant to website builders as well.
Overall, Shopify, Duda and Hostinger have managed to keep fairly strong reputations.
Pricing
Website builders tend to be more expensive than standard shared hosting for two main reasons.
It includes hosting and the builder software
Because most website builder websites can’t be migrated, there isn’t as much pressure on the host to offer competitive pricing beyond initial offers
However, even with the Wild West-style pricing, most builders aren’t prohibitively priced. When comparing pricing, be sure to review any renewal cost hikes to avoid straining your budget. It’s also a good idea to look at current customer reviews to check for current concerns about billing errors, auto-renewals and cancellations.
Square Online, Duda and Hostinger offer fairly low entry-level costs.

When building a website using a builder, the costs break down a bit differently than general website building costs. This is because hosting is included as part of the package and most people using builders do so as a DIY instead of hiring an agency to build it for them.
While free plans are available and there is no upper limit to costs, I can give you an average cost range for most SMBs to build and maintain a website using a website builder based on years of experience with website builders and creating websites for SMBs using many different service providers.
Initial Average Cost Range
Renewal Average Cost Range
Comments
Total Costs
$10 to $800 monthly
$50 to $1,000 monthly
One-time costs can drastically change these numbers in some cases.
Website Builder and Hosting Plan
$10 to $720 monthly
$25 to $850 monthly
While free plans are available and lower averages, the median monthly entry-level plan averages between $30 and $40 monthly for most providers.
Themes or Templates
Free to $250 one-time cost
Most themes have a one-time purchase cost, although some will charge update fees as new versions come out. E-commerce themes tend to be the most expensive.
Domain Name
Free to $20 annually
$10 to $50 annually
The top-level domain (TLD), registrar, included features and demand for the name all influence domain name pricing.
Plugins, Extensions and Integrations
Free to $100 monthly
Pricing varies widely, with e-commerce websites spending the most. Most extensions have a subscription cost that doesn’t change at renewal.
SSL or TLS
Free to $40 annually
Free to $40 annually
Almost all hosts include basic SSLs in hosting plans. However, a few charge extra, or you might buy directly from a Certificate Authority (CA). Some domain registrars, such as Cloudflare and Porkbun, also include SSLs as part of domain registration fees.
Advanced SSL (optional)
$50 to $350 annually
A few website builders give a free temporary basic SSL and automatically switch users to higher-priced options. Otherwise, pricing is fairly stable regardless of renewals through either your host as an addon or directly through a Certificate Authority (CA).

Which Website Builder Is Best for Your Business?
The bottom line is that which website builder is best depends on your business. Let’s go over some use cases to bring it all together.
Best Website Builders for Businesses on a Budget
Tight budgets limit website builder options in different ways. If you need overall low costs but can pay a longer-term upfront, Hostinger offers well-rounded builder packages with deep discounts for four-year contracts. If you need low-cost monthly payment plans, Square Online shifts costs from monthly subscriptions to pay-as-you-sell transaction fees. For kitchen table entrepreneurs with no budget to spare, starting with Strikingly’s free plan offers a place to start but gives you room to upgrade later as your budget grows.
Best Website Builders for Beginners
For beginners, look for website builders with intuitive controls and jargon-free help files. Platforms that include certified design experts are also helpful in case you need to hire help later. Strikingly, Hostinger and Simvoly all include easy onboarding processes with helpful tips, while Shopify also has a stable of brand design professionals available for hire.
Best Website Builders for E-Commerce
E-commerce is its own special beast. There is a lot of functionality that must be added compared to other website types and security concerns are paramount. For strong e-commerce tools, consider Shopify, Square Online or Squarespace.
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
How long will it take to build a website for my business?
It can take anywhere from 30 minutes to weeks to make a website for your business.
Are website builders expensive?
Website builders generally cost more than basic cPanel shared hosting because the builder software and hosting are combined. However, starting costs are generally under $20 per month.
Are there any free website builders?
Yes, there are several great free website builders available. Google Sites, Strikingly, Square and HubSpot all offer free website builders. However, some only allow subdomains and most come with host-branded “made by” banners somewhere on your website.
Can I build a website for free?
You can absolutely build a website for free. Free builders like Google Sites and HubSpot make it simple, or you can use an open-source content management system (CMS) like WordPress.org paired with a free hosting plan.
How do I build an e-commerce website?
Building an e-commerce website is much like building other websites, except for the storefront itself. You still need a landing page, disclosures and privacy notices, and supporting content. For an e-commerce website, you’ll have to build a product library, set up taxes and shipping, and manage order tracking as well.
How do I get a domain name?
You can get a domain name through your web host or an authorized domain registrar. While getting a domain through your host often comes with an initial discount and may be easier to set up with your website, using a dedicated domain registrar often costs less at renewal and comes with extra perks like CDNs and SSL certificates.
How do I host my website?
The vast majority of website builders automatically include hosting in your subscription. For builders using WordPress, you may need to select a host independently and upload your website files to that host. Be sure to look for the best website hosting service to fit your needs and budget that’s compatible with your website builder platform.

The Forbes Advisor editorial team is independent and objective. To help support our reporting work, and to continue our ability to provide this content for free to our readers, we receive compensation from the companies that advertise on the Forbes Advisor site. This compensation comes from two main sources. First, we provide paid placements to advertisers to present their offers. The compensation we receive for those placements affects how and where advertisers' offers appear on the site.
This site does not include all companies or products available within the market.
Second, we also include links to advertisers' offers in some of our articles; these “affiliate links” may generate income for our site when you click on them. The compensation we receive from advertisers does not influence the recommendations or advice our editorial team provides in our articles or otherwise impact any of the editorial content on Forbes Advisor. While we work hard to provide accurate and up to date information that we think you will find relevant, Forbes Advisor does not and cannot guarantee that any information provided is complete and makes no representations or warranties in connection thereto, nor to the accuracy or applicability thereof. Here is a list of our partners who offer products that we have affiliate links for.
