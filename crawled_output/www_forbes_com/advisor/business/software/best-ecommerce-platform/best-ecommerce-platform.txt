As an e-commerce business owner, I’ve seen a lot of changes over the last decade, with e-commerce nearly doubling as a percentage of retail sales, according to eMarketer. E-commerce platforms have changed a lot as well, with far more no-code and DIY online store options available than ever before. All those extra options make it more confusing than ever for business owners to pick the right e-commerce platform for their business. In fact, What’s the best e-commerce platform? and What e-commerce platform should I use? are the most common questions I’m asked by other business owners wanting to step into e-commerce.I teamed up with our data research team to compare prices, features, performance and even reputation of nearly two dozen platforms, and I personally tested each one to compile real insights to help you find the best e-commerce solution for you.

Expert Take
Ecwid by Lightspeed is one of the few beginner-friendly e-commerce platforms that allows easy embedding of your entire store into another website. Copy and paste a bit of code Ecwid provides into just about any website or website builder that allows HTML injections to create a shop within your preferred website design. This opens up a lot of possibilities for small businesses with an existing website that just want to add e-commerce functionality easily.
Ecwid also offers site hosting as part of its plans if you don’t want to embed your store elsewhere. Great security features, such as data backups and privacy protections, are available, and Ecwid is PCI-DSS certified. The online store builder includes free themes and is very intuitive overall.
Ecwid offers over 70 payment processing options, including cash, Lightspeed Payments and popular choices like Stripe and PayPal.
Pricing and features are not quite as attractive as they once were, however. Ecwid used to be the starting point for many online shops due to a free forever plan, but pricing changed at the start of 2025 Q2. The previously free Starter plan is now $5 monthly but still carries the nearly draconian limits on products and features. The other plans bumped in price slightly, but are still very competitive.
It is worth noting that Ecwid no longer offers a free custom domain name option, and buying a domain name directly from Ecwid has limits that make going through another domain registrar a better option in many cases. Likewise, customer service availability varies by plan. All plans come with access to the self-help knowledge base and email support. However, for live chat or callback phone support, you’ll have to upgrade to higher-tier plans, and hours are limited.

Ecwid has long been the go-to low-cost option for beginners, but recent price increases and feature changes have raised customer concerns over value, particularly with the formerly free plan’s now-costly restrictions. Users generally love the easy setup and ability to embed stores into existing websites that might not otherwise enable e-commerce.

Testing Insights
Overall, Ecwid is very beginner-friendly. I especially like the logical method that the product setup follows, and the builder itself is reasonable, although it lacks true drag-and-drop functionality. Initial store setup—those behind-the-scenes items like checkout fields, such as order confirmation email settings, taxes, customer groups and legal notices—feels almost randomly tossed into a catch-all settings menu and are hard to find.

Expert Take
Squarespace does a good job of removing the technical skill barrier to entry that some other e-commerce platforms have. E-commerce solutions like Shopify and BigCommerce offer great scalability and can handle complex online sales needs, but they can be overwhelming when you are just starting out. Someone who has never built a website or worked with any e-commerce platform can DIY build an online store with Squarespace.
In fact, it’s a perpetual star on my best blogging platform and best CMS lists.
Squarespace offers an easy-to-use blog paywall feature for creators expanding beyond social media for e-commerce.
Squarespace offers a simplified website builder that may be frustrating to anyone with website-building experience, but strikes just the right combination of control and presets for beginners. Admittedly, some templates are pretty dated and remind me of when McDonald’s took all the color out of buildings and went with an industrial HOA look, but there are some gems hidden in there if you take the time to scroll long enough.
I also like that POS integration is included in every plan, so if you’re a small Main Street shop trying to modernize, you can keep everything together. The blog monetization tools are the outstanding feature, though, allowing creators to easily handle paywalled blog content like online video tutorials or even subscription boxes.

Like many e-commerce platforms, the primary complaint about Squarespace is a lack of customer service, with some users finding it frustrating and even labeling it useless. However, many like the templates and the easy setup process for the product itself. Many praise how easy it is for beginners to get set up for simple stores without needing outside help. However, domain management concerns and other costs are worrisome to users.

Sometimes I expect too much from a beginner website builder. Anytime I log into Squarespace, it always startles me with how basic its online store maker is. That said, it gets the job done and is far easier to get e-commerce and blogs set up than most other e-commerce sites.
However, the repeated but non-constant glitches do bother me because they could be very discouraging for new DIYers. For example, sometimes the builder gets stuck in a loop where you can’t get out of the design features to move to content creation. The only way out is to go back to your main dashboard. Sometimes you even need to log out and back in. It also tends to work better in Chrome than in other browsers.

Expert Take
Shopify built its reputation on providing enterprise tools to SMBs. Shopify is nearly as synonymous with e-commerce as Google is with search. However, like Google’s mixed search reputation, Shopify has its detractors as well. Additional costs, high plan fees and customization difficulties that require hiring professional help are all fairly common complaints. That said, it is still an extremely powerful e-commerce platform and a good option for many SMBs.
A streamlined basic store starts as low as $5 monthly, but more fully featured plans start at $39 monthly. While basic POS functionality is included in many plans, specific use cases like restaurant and advanced POS features can run another $89 monthly. While the free trial is short at only three days, Shopify offers discounted $1 monthly pricing for the first three paid months, so you have plenty of time to test-drive the system before committing to full price plans.
Shopify includes a helpful assistant called Sidekick to walk new users through store creation.
All that taken into account, there’s still a lot to offer. Basic store setup is beginner-friendly, multiple currency conversions are available, multiple inventory locations are easily managed and many marketplaces are supported. Shopify also has a huge library of over 8,000 third-party apps to add even more features and functions so you can connect your Shopify store to your favorite business software without a complicated third-party API system.

Shopify is a very popular platform with extensive third-party integrations and customers frequently comment on those extra connections. Customers also like the user-friendly initial setup, although some cite having to hire professional help to make detailed customization changes. Customers also frequently complain about how quickly plan costs escalate, transaction fees and the lack of customer service on lower-tier plans.

I want to like Shopify, I really do. There’s a lot of good going for it, at least for straightforward shops, and the setup process is surprisingly simple. The problems I always run into are when I try to do anything outside of the ordinary, especially with advanced features like setting up a marketplace on your shop where creators can list products to sell with you.
For example, there are odd restrictions on things like the file sizes that your creators can upload that aren’t there if a random shopper directly uploads a design for you to customize a product with. So just be aware that for SMBs without a tech team, features beyond the basics often require a lot of work or hiring a Shopify professional to implement.

Expert Take
BigCommerce is a rare find. While it offers powerful tools at affordable rates for SMB, it also offers enterprise-level tools so you never outgrow the platform. If your startup turns out to be the next Apple, BigCommerce can stay with you the whole time, from training wheels to global sensation. In fact, it’s powerful enough to top my best content management system list.
That said, the interface isn’t as pretty or smooth as beginner-style DIY builders like Squarespace, but the functionality goes deeper, and more customization is possible than most “pretty” platforms. It’s also designed with pure e-commerce in mind, so POS integrations aren’t necessarily included in every plan or as natively connected as an e-commerce solution built around in-person sales connections like Square Online.
Some of the store builder tools are a bit clunky in BigCommerce, like having to jump out of the main editor into a new screen to manage hero images.
While hosting is included with plans, I absolutely love that you can get upgraded enterprise-level hosting as your needs grow. Hosting resource and speed limits are a near-universal weakness of all-in-one e-commerce platforms, and this upgrade option gives online shop owners a great resource as needs and budgets grow.
Another great option is multiple storefronts. If your business has multiple product lines that need to be segregated, BigCommerce makes it easy to manage all of them on one account. There is a small cost per additional storefront that varies by plan, but the option is a welcome simplification and cost saver for many businesses.

BigCommerce is primarily an enterprise-level platform but offers scaled-down options for small businesses at affordable prices. Customers appreciate the strength and scalability of the platform but dislike how many third-party integrations are needed for many e-commerce functions. Primarily this concern is because some integrations carry additional fees, but that is common across all e-commerce platforms. Customers also mention it is less user-friendly for basic features than some other platforms.

While not as intuitive as some other e-commerce platforms, BigCommerce isn’t a particularly steep learning curve either. That said, there are quirks, like the builder carousel controls having to be edited outside of the main page editing controls (similar to some WordPress themes).
While the builder isn’t sleek and flashy, it gets the job done, and I was impressed with the ease of setting up actual e-commerce functions. I’m especially fond of how easy the automatic payment testing feature makes getting payments set up compared to other platforms that aren’t as testing-friendly.

Square is well-known as one of the best POS systems for small businesses, but many don’t realize the online e-commerce platform, Square Online, is also a great option. Square Online’s power lies in its integration with onsite selling.
For businesses that rely on in-person interactions but need to add the convenience of online shopping, Square Online is your go-to. For example, food trucks that want to offer mobile ordering, craft fair makers that want to enable pre-orders, and traditional brick-and-mortar stores wanting to add buy online, pick up in store (BOPIS).
Square Online lets you customize what columns show on your product overview reports.
For those on a shoestring budget, Square Online offers a forever-free plan where your costs are covered by transaction fees when you actually get an order, so there’s no upfront cost to you. However, all Square Online plans carry transaction fees, so if you are paying for a higher tier, you must consider those fees when planning your budget.
While there are reports of slow customer service, phone support is available on all plans weekdays, which is something most e-commerce platforms don’t offer except with the highest-tier plans.

Square Online is popular for businesses with a lot of in-person sales and those on a budget who appreciate the free tier where they only pay transaction fees as they get sales. However, as sales increase, the transaction fees become a negative, with customers disliking having to upgrade significantly to lower those fees with every sale. Easy setup and simple controls are favorite features of most. Disputes are a concern, however, as users dislike how the Square POS dispute system heavily favors end users and not merchants.

Square’s e-commerce features and website builder meet what they were designed for. They aren’t meant to go toe to toe or feature to feature with something like Shopify. For most, the builder itself will be the most frustrating part, not the e-commerce.
The builder is very basic and has weird limitations, like being unable to move text around in a design block. An e-commerce website from Square isn’t going to win you any awards, but it is functional.

Expert Take
Wix does a phenomenal job of blending e-commerce functions with a robust general website builder. Many e-commerce platform website builders lack features for the non-selling parts of your website. Wix doesn’t neglect either side of the equation, making it an excellent option for SMBs who don’t want to sacrifice the style and substance of their website to enable e-commerce.
Wix’s e-commerce features are overall robust with analytics, marketing tools and an impressive number of integrations with third-party tools.
Wix makes it easy to add custom coding and elements to your website.
Wix also offers two website builders, the more streamlined Classic builder and the powerful Studio builder that includes agency features. For beginners, the Classic builder is easier and the help documentation is better. For advanced features and if you want to work with a Wix design professional, or if you run an agency, the Studio builder is a better option. The Studio builder plans also offer more server resources on some plans.
That said, not all of Wix’s plans allow e-commerce. The Standard Studio builder plan and Core Classic builder plans are the cheapest plans that allow you to accept payments. While Wix is more expensive than many other website builders, it is cheaper than many e-commerce platforms. It also offers 50% off sales a few times a year, but you usually only see notice of the sale when hitting the upgrade button from your website dashboard.

Wix has arguably the most powerful DIY website builders available. However, in spite of drag-and-drop interfaces and quick setup, many users express frustration with the complexity of more advanced features beyond the bare basics. Customer service concerns and increased costs are also concerns, especially as not all plans support e-commerce. However, customers consistently praise the easy initial setup and the wide variety of free, high-quality templates.

One thing I love about Wix is that it is simple enough for a beginner but deep enough for a professional. However, while I personally love the newer Studio builder, I can’t recommend it to complete beginners because the help files haven’t caught up yet, and many features will require using help docs if you haven’t built an online store or website before.

Expert Take
Think of OpenCart as the WordPress of e-commerce. OpenCart is a complete open-source platform on its own that doesn’t have to run inside of WordPress. Like other open-source software, it is free, but you have to pay for hosting. Unlike most open source platforms, direct technical support is available, but it comes with an often hefty extra cost. A community forum is available for shop owners to help each other without cost.
Hosting costs are up to you, with OpenCart hosting available through any cPanel or host-branded control panel-style hosting. That said, OpenCart has partnered with Scala Hosting to offer powerful cloud VPS hosting options designed and optimized for OpenCart performance. I am particularly fond of this model over all-in-one platforms because it means you aren’t stuck with limited, generic shared hosting plans that many all-in-one platforms offer.
Theme management and editing in OpenCart requires patience and fighting through a deeper learning curve than other e-commerce platforms.
With direct hosting, you always know what your server resources are. It’s also a fantastic safety net for technical support outside of OpenCart. If anything goes wrong with hosting, you have your host’s included tech support, like Scala Hosting’s 24/7 live chat support with a 30-second guaranteed response time or its 15-minute response time ticketed support.
Like WordPress, beyond the core features, you’ll need a plug-in (extension) to add functionality. OpenCart boasts a whopping 13,000 third-party extensions—some free, some paid. That adds a lot of flexibility for online stores. For example, there are 1,368 payment gateway integrations alone.

OpenCart is well-received for its free open source nature that gives low-budget startups an option with great scalability. Users also like the extensive integration and flexibility, although the initial learning curve is steep. However, security and performance concerns are flies in the ointment.

Flexibility comes at a cost of time spent with OpenCart. Like WordPress, there is a steeper learning curve, and OpenCart can easily overwhelm beginners. Unlike options like Squarespace or Wix, where it’s very plug-and-play, there is a good bit of work to be done to set up OpenCart.
Likewise, it’s not particularly intuitive, and menus often make about as much sense as the last step in IKEA instructions. However, if you can stick with it, the possibilities are nearly endless, with deep customization possible. The real benefit of OpenCart is flexibility, not being tied into one hosting choice or stuck under another CMS like WordPress.

Expert Take
Big Cartel is a low-cost, simplified option for setting up an online store. While not as robust as other options, it’s got some nice extra features for the lower price point. The store builder is also deceptively simple-looking, but the sidebar control system is quick for beginners to pick up and keeps things organized.
I love that they offer automated sales tax handling and real-time shipping rates from USPS (for paid plans). Lower-cost plans often overlook those. Plus, the mobile store management app that handles in-person orders is a great option for crafters and artisans working various festivals and weekend shows.
From theme selection to palettes to images, Big Cartel shop controls are handled in a sidebar menu system.
Third-party integrations are fairly limited, but basic services for shipping, marketing and dropshipping are available and easily installed. Signing up for a free plan to check if the available integrations fit your needs is a smart step before committing to a free Big Commerce plan.
It’s also worth noting that Big Cartel reviews tend to be skewed on aggregator sites like TrustPilot. Since Big Cartel users skew toward small shops, the branding on free stores can be confusing to shoppers, and many negative reviews are actually people who were trying to complain about the individual shop they bought from, not Big Cartel.

Big Cartel is widely praised for its low costs without added transaction fees and the overall ease of setting up new online stores. Limited customization and integrations worry some looking towards growth, however. While users love the idea of a mobile shop management app, many also call the apps buggy and problematic to use. Overall, it’s a mixed bag, with users debating whether the great price point is balanced with the available feature level.

I won’t deny that Big Cartel is sleek and pretty out of the box, which can be a little scary at first glance. However, the dashboard is fairly well laid out and the builder gets the job done with strong task menus in the sidebar to guide you through the steps to making it more robust. It also has quick links to help files as you go through the setup process.
Another thing I really like about Big Cartel setup is that it doesn’t take you out of product addition when you need to handle another task. For example, most e-commerce platforms kick you out of product creation to go set up categories and other background information. That often throws off folks just setting up their first few products. Big Cartel uses a pop-up that sets the basics but doesn’t lose the product you were creating, making initial shop setup much easier.

Expert Take
SEO tools are a near-universal blind spot for e-commerce platforms. Shift4Shop offers more core technical SEO tools than others at a much lower price. If your business relies on search engine result page (SERP) placement, Shift4Shop gives you great control and tools to help you rank higher. Easily accessed robots.txt, canonical URLs, a meta tag wizard, Google tagging, redirects and sitemaps are only the tip of the iceberg.
Beyond SEO, all the core e-commerce tools you expect are easily accessed and managed. The hardest part about Shift4Shop is setting up your store theme, which requires more steps than it should. However, once you are past that hurdle, setup is fairly simple.
Shift4Shop offers plenty of themes, but theme management is a bit more complex than on many other e-commerce platforms.
Do bear in mind that payment processing options are limited. You can either use PayPal or Shift4. If you use Shift4, your plan is free if you process at least $1,000 in sales each month. Do bear in mind that the minimum processing amount has changed from time to time, so it’s best to confirm it with Shift4Shop before signing up, as we do every time we review the platform. However, you can start your shop for free, and you’ll have a month to make your payment processor decision if you want to play around with the platform before making a final decision.
Customer service is my biggest concern with Shift4Shop, and contacting someone often means providing a lot of information, even when logged in, before you can talk to anyone.

Shift4Shop was once 3D Cart and the transition left a lot of angry customers in its wake. The vast majority of negative reviews are about the changeover and new processes. Other concerns usually revolve around the learning curve and customer service. However, customers consistently express surprise at how full-featured the platform is for the low price.

Shift4Shop is one of those rare e-commerce platforms where you don’t often want to bang your head against a wall because small features that should be simple aren’t working right. Mostly, outside of an awkward template manager, it is smooth sailing to get a shop up and running with easy menus and controls that make sense.
However, you will likely need to talk to customer service in setting up your payment processing if you want to use the Shift4 option as it doesn’t always show during setup automatically.

Expert Take
While PrestaShop is a nice alternative to other open-source e-commerce platforms and those that require WordPress, like WooCommerce, I’m not fond of the hosted option for PrestaShop due to billing concerns. It’s always a concern to me when a credit card is required for a free trial.
Beyond billing concerns with the hosted option, I do like that the hosting option includes an hour-long call with an expert to walk you through the setup process and GDPR-compliant legal templates. With PrestaShop’s European focus, it’s one of the few options where European laws and guidelines don’t feel like an afterthought.
PrestaShop has a user-friendly and well-organized shop setup process.
Like other open-source solutions, PrestaShop relies heavily on plugins, some free and many costing extra. However, the core functionality for most basic e-commerce shops is nicely covered by the vanilla version, and there is a nice selection of integrations with other tools such as PayPal. Installing PrestaShop on the best e-commerce hosting platforms is simplified by its inclusion with the Softaculous installer, which is included by most top web hosts.

PrestaShop’s reputation is fairly mixed, with primary complaints seeming to center around either the hosting partnership performance or the cost of plugins for the self-hosted free version. Others praise that it is open source and flexible, and note that plugin costs vary by what the user chooses. However, others note a general slowness for updates and bug fixes that can pile on costs in spite of the initially free core system. Overall, it seems that those looking for a fully free option are the most upset, while others willing to invest in modules and have the technical skills to work with the system more fully are more satisfied.

In testing, PrestaShop tried to put a hold on funds (at least temporarily) to check if the card has enough to cover a full year of service, even if you choose the monthly subscription option. With my card, it initially appeared as a full charge, but my bank declined it due to being an offshore purchase, and the trial continued. However, that large charge attempt after the site promised no charge would be made for 14 days is concerning.
Function-wise, I admit to being a fan of how the controls are organized and the step-by-step store creation guide. Overly complicated controls are a common problem with e-commerce platforms as they try to be everything to everyone. PrestaShop starts with a solid set of basics you can build on with plugins.
Methodology
We start with data at Forbes Advisor. Beginning with a list of nearly two dozen industry-recognized e-commerce platforms, our dedicated data team digs deep into features, specifications and consumer sentiment to rank providers based on solid factors. From there, I test every provider hands-on to find where it lives up to promises and where it falls short.

Four Levels of Fact-Checking
Hands-On Testing
What Is an E-Commerce Platform
An e-commerce platform is a type of software designed to allow online selling and buying. Different platforms tend to specialize in different facets of e-commerce. For example, some focus on blending POS and online sales, while others might focus on memberships or subscriptions.
E-commerce platforms generally include tools to:
Create a storefront
Handle payments and connect to payment processors
Integrate with in-person sales tools and point of sale (POS) systems
Create and manage a product catalog
Manage and update inventory
Manage appointment bookings
Manage subscription for digital or physical products
Facilitate digital product downloads and rights management
Manage order fulfillment and tracking
Facilitate marketing, including promotions and email marketing
Adjust SEO settings
Comply with security and privacy regulations and guidelines such as PCI-DSS
E-commerce platforms often include hosting, but some, like WooCommerce, are meant to work within other programs and do not include hosting. There are also headless e-commerce systems where the storefront and the backend functionality are separated to create a more unique shopping experience.
Differences Between E-Commerce Hosting and E-Commerce Platforms
E-commerce platforms are the software that runs your online store, while e-commerce hosting is website hosting designed to handle the more demanding needs of online stores for security, bandwidth, storage, uptime and server response times.
E-commerce hosting can be offered as a package deal with an all-in-one e-commerce solution or separately for systems working with other software and CMS products such as WordPress or Joomla!. E-commerce hosting is most often shared hosting, but packages can be for VPS, cloud or dedicated server hosting as well. Most of the best web hosting providers offer e-commerce-optimized hosting plans.
How Much Does an E-Commerce Platform Cost
E-commerce platform costs vary widely and range from free to thousands of dollars a month. Paid e-commerce platforms average around $39 for entry-level plans. Free e-commerce platforms often come with product and domain restrictions, along with limited features. Some also don’t include hosting and almost all plans require purchasing a custom domain name (at least after first year discounts).
Additional costs for e-commerce platforms beyond initial subscription fees often include: domain name (purchased from the e-commerce platform or through a domain registrar), integrations/plug-ins for extra functionality such as QBO for accounting, shipping management, dropshipping, product reviews and chatbots.
How To Choose the Best E-Commerce Platform
Finding the best e-commerce solution for your business means matching your needs to the platform and to your budget. Start by defining your budget and which features are must-haves and which features are would-like-to-haves for your plans.
Pro Tip
One of my favorite tricks is discovering which e-commerce platform my favorite shops use. When you’re looking for your first e-commerce platform, examining the tech stacks of shops with the features you want can help you narrow down your choices. Use a website like builtWith to peek under the hood.
Essential E-Commerce Platform Features
Beyond specialized needs for specific industries and online store types, there are some core features all e-commerce platforms should include, or have the ability to add on.
Web hosting. You need web hosting to store your online store’s content and serve it to visitors. All-in-one e-commerce platforms generally include hosting as part of the plans, but some will need stand-alone hosting at an additional cost.
Store and product embedding. Being able to connect your online store to other websites you own or post “buy” buttons on social media for featured products can improve sales. Single product “buy now” buttons are more common, while full store embedding, such as Ecwid offers, is less common.
Payment processors. Payment processors handle the electronic payments for your store. Processors, such as Stripe, Clover and PayPal, accept different payment methods, such as credit cards or electronic checks. Some e-commerce platforms offer a branded processor, while others only connect to outside processors. Be sure to watch for platforms that charge extra transaction fees if you don’t use the platform’s native processor.
Security. More security is always better, especially when dealing with sensitive data. For e-commerce platforms, non-negotiable security includes SSL or TLS certificates and PCI-DSS compliance. You’ll also benefit from features such as malware scanning, 2FA, user controls and automatic backups.
Online store builder. Unless you are using headless e-commerce and building your own storefront, a visual no-code website builder is vital to create your website. While some e-commerce platforms provide basic builders, some are powerful enough to regularly rank as some of the best website builders available. Having an included store builder also helps control your website costs.
Marketing. While it’s up to you to create a comprehensive marketing strategy, your e-commerce website should include marketing tools such as email marketing (or a connection to third-party email marketing software), connections to social media or social media management programs, sales and coupon management, affiliate programs and SEO controls. Some even allow you to set up pay-per-click (PPC) advertising from your online store dashboard.
Customer and technical support. Stakes are high in e-commerce, and every moment there is a glitch, you can’t figure out a feature or the site is down, costs add up rapidly. For the retail industry, the average cost of downtime is a staggering $1.1 million per hour, while small businesses in every industry average up to $25,000 in losses every hour. An e-commerce platform needs to have easy-to-reach and effective support.
Overall Value
We’d all love to have unlimited budgets, but the reality is that some e-commerce solutions will be out of reach. For example, Adobe Commerce, formerly Magento, generally costs upwards of $22,000 per year and is out of reach for many SMBs.
For most of us starting our first online store, or even making the first upgrade to a stronger platform, it’s a matter of getting the best mix of features for the price that’s within our budget.
Online store costs include:
Platform subscription costs. This is the e-commerce platform cost. If you can pay for a year or more upfront, most platforms offer discounts over monthly billing.
Payment gateway fees. Payment processors and credit card companies charge fees and percentages on every transaction.
Transaction fees. Some e-commerce platforms charge additional transaction fees on top of payment processing costs. A few charge transaction fees in lieu of a subscription cost, but others charge a fee if you don’t use the native platform payment processor.
Hosting costs. Many e-commerce platforms include hosting in the standard plan costs. However, headless e-commerce and e-commerce platforms designed to work within other systems or as open source platforms, such as OpenCart, may require you to purchase your own hosting plan. While basic shared hosting plan costs average between $6 and $35 monthly after introductory offers expire, e-commerce optimized hosting plans tend to range between $20 and $40 monthly on average. Note that managed hosting generally costs more than unmanaged hosting.
Extra costs. Extra costs associated with your e-commerce platform may include integration app fees and subscriptions, domain name costs, SSL or TLS certificates, design help and security add-ons.
Ease of Use
Without your own dedicated tech support department or a professional web developer and website designer team, you need an e-commerce platform that is easy to use. Look for e-commerce solutions that include intuitive menu arrangements and website builder controls, along with strong self-help knowledge bases and easy-to-reach technical support to improve your DIY experience.
Features and Functionality
Not all e-commerce solutions offer the same functions. Some offer limited core features plus many third-party integrations, such as Shopify, while others specialize in specific product types or sales channels. For example, Ghost focuses on paywalled digital content, and Square Online focuses on blending online and in-person shopping.
Matching the platform to what you are selling and your sales channels will save a lot of headaches now and when you are ready to scale in the future.
Integrations
No one can be an expert in everything, and e-commerce platforms are no different. The best e-commerce platforms recognize when better solutions already exist for specialized tasks and make it easy for you to connect those tools to your e-commerce store.
Common third-party integrations to look for include:
Accounting
Taxes
Marketing
Shipping
Payment processing
Customer loyalty
Affiliate programs
Scalability
Scalability means the ability to expand or contract your operations at any given time. While most e-commerce platforms offer shared hosting, which limits control and instantaneous resource scaling compared to cloud hosting, they usually provide the option to upgrade or downgrade plans with minimal delays. Still, because of the lack of instant scalability, you may want to plan ahead for busy seasons and temporarily upgrade ahead of time when needed.
Long-term scalability is also a concern. You need an e-commerce solution that can grow with you as your business grows overall. More than just hosting resources, that often means needing extra inventory locations, new sales channels and specialized sales features.
What Is the Best E-Commerce Platform for Your Business?
Finding the best e-commerce platform for your business largely depends on your budget, what you are selling, your technical skills and your goals. What’s right for one isn’t right for everyone. For example, you may not need a point of sale (POS) system if you are 100% online, but you may need integration with marketplaces like eBay or Amazon.
Here are my recommendations for a few use cases:
Best Free or Cheap E-Commerce Platforms
If you are on a shoestring budget, an e-commerce platform that minimizes up-front costs with free starter plans or low-cost starter plans might be best for you. OpenCart, Big Cartel and Square Online all offer free e-commerce plans.
Best E-Commerce Platforms for Scalability
If you expect to grow quickly or have long-term plans and don’t want to risk needing to change platforms later, look at e-commerce solutions with plenty of third-party integrations, custom enterprise plans and extra hosting options. Shopify and BigCommerce both offer many advanced features and growth capabilities.
Best E-Commerce Platform for Beginners
If you are a one-person show or a small business without a tech team, you need a platform that has a low learning curve with simplified controls and great online help files. While e-commerce is complex, good beginner e-commerce platforms include Ecwid, Squarespace and Square Online.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
Which e-commerce platform is best for dropshipping?
For sheer volume of choices and popularity, Shopify rules dropshipping in e-commerce with over 500 integrations to choose from. However, BigCommerce also offers great dropshipping controls and has over a dozen integrations with some of the biggest names in dropshipping, like Printful and AliExpress. BigCommerce also includes several integrations with dropshipping aggregators like Doba and Sprocket, which connect to hundreds of suppliers.
What is the best B2B e-commerce platform?
B2B e-commerce has specialized needs such as custom payment terms, password-protected catalogs and user controls. E-commerce providers with more advanced features to cater to B2B online selling needs include BigCommerce, Shopify and Shift4Shop.
How do I build an e-commerce website?
The easiest way to build an e-commerce website is to use an e-commerce platform that includes a visual no-code builder with free design templates. E-commerce solutions such as Square Online, Squarespace and Ecwid are particularly popular with beginners. Another option is to use your favorite website builder or CMS, such as WordPress, and embed your entire Ecwid store by copying and pasting a bit of code Ecwid provides.
What is a headless e-commerce platform?
Headless e-commerce platforms are e-commerce software that work in the background. Instead of controlling the shop design and user interface, plus the e-commerce functionality, headless e-commerce works with other software and APIs to do the behind-the-scenes work while other systems control the user interface and look. While not for beginners, headless e-commerce platforms offer the most formatting options, flexibility, customization and scalability.
What is an open-source e-commerce platform?
Open-source e-commerce platforms are similar to WordPress. That is, the code of the software can be seen by anyone and the licensing has few limits. In general, anyone can see the full coding of the software and adjust it or contribute to the overall codebase. Most open-source e-commerce platforms require separate hosting plans. Magento Open Source, OpenCart and PrestaCart are all open source e-commerce platforms.
Is there a free alternative to Shopify?
Yes, there are free Shopify alternatives. Open source platforms like WooCommerce and OpenCart are the most common free Shopify alternatives, although those often come with extra costs in hosting and plug-in needs. Other e-commerce platforms with free plans include Square Online (charges transaction fees), Big Cartel and Shift4Shop (if you have enough sales volume).

The Forbes Advisor editorial team is independent and objective. To help support our reporting work, and to continue our ability to provide this content for free to our readers, we receive compensation from the companies that advertise on the Forbes Advisor site. This compensation comes from two main sources. First, we provide paid placements to advertisers to present their offers. The compensation we receive for those placements affects how and where advertisers' offers appear on the site.
This site does not include all companies or products available within the market.
Second, we also include links to advertisers' offers in some of our articles; these “affiliate links” may generate income for our site when you click on them. The compensation we receive from advertisers does not influence the recommendations or advice our editorial team provides in our articles or otherwise impact any of the editorial content on Forbes Advisor. While we work hard to provide accurate and up to date information that we think you will find relevant, Forbes Advisor does not and cannot guarantee that any information provided is complete and makes no representations or warranties in connection thereto, nor to the accuracy or applicability thereof. Here is a list of our partners who offer products that we have affiliate links for.
