Gantt chart software is an invaluable tool for project managers needing to create a detailed chart of events with subtasks, dependencies, start dates, due dates and task overlaps. While you may think Gantt charts in project management software are created equally, you’d be wrong, which is why we are bringing you a roundup of the best Gantt chart software.
The Forbes Advisor data team and I have analyzed 17 pieces of Gantt chart software using our proprietary rubric, which considered consumer sentiment, value, features and four other categories. Once the providers had been whittled down to the top 10, I performed thorough hands-on testing before awarding final scores. Our research shows that ClickUp, with its easy-to-use Gantt charts, myriad other project management tools, and affordable plans, is ideal for most SMBs. However, nine other platforms deserve your consideration. Let’s dive in.

If you’re looking for top-notch Gantt chart software that also offers everything from Kanban boards to lists and calendars to resource management tools, ClickUp is for you. ClickUp’s Gantt charts are robust and support dependencies, subtasks and milestones. They’re also easy to use thanks to an intuitive drag-and-drop mechanic that lets you quickly change start and end dates. In addition, ClickUp is ideal for remote project teams as it offers class-leading collaborative docs, whiteboards, mind maps and an instant messenger that’s good enough to replace Slack.
ClickUp’s instant messenger supports text, voice and video messaging.

You can also upload files to specific tasks and even proof images and documents. ClickUp offers one of the best free plans around, which helped it top our roundup of the best free Gantt chart software.

Real-world users of ClickUp have mixed feelings about the platform. On the one hand, users love the platform’s flexibility, customization options, automation capabilities and ability to be used for personal and work projects. On the other hand, many users complain about the interface of the mobile applications, customer support and issues with billing. While I have never experienced these issues, your mileage may vary.

Testing Insights
ClickUp’s interface is on the bland side, but it is very functional.
I have used ClickUp to help plan and manage everything from corporate events for my photography business to mass hiring events for large retailers, and I have never stumbled while using it. While not the nicest-looking software, ClickUp is very easy to navigate and most of its tools are user-friendly. Only advanced tools, such as mind maps, can cause a few headaches, and even then, you’ll soon get used to how they work. If you lean on ClickUp’s templates, you can get even the most complex projects off the ground without breaking a sweat.

Expert Take
I have used dozens of project management software options, and I have not come across many that are as user-friendly as Monday.com. The myriad project templates for predictive project management methodologies and agile frameworks make it easy for new teams and those unfamiliar with project management software to get projects off the ground quickly. The slick Gantt charts, which are available on the web and desktop applications, support dependencies and milestones and work flawlessly, as do the Kanban boards, lists and reporting dashboards.
You can use Gantt charts on the web and desktop versions of Monday.com.
Like others, Monday.com offers integrations and automations to help make your work life easier. You’ll also find collaborative documents, a robust messaging system and mobile applications. However, the latter does not allow you to use Gantt charts while on the go, which is a shame. Regarding pricing, most SMBs will find Monday.com within reach. Unfortunately, the free plan is dire, and the $12 per user, when billed monthly, Basic plan offers no value. Still, the Standard and Pro plans, which cost $14 and $24, respectively, offer some of the best value in the space.

However, many users find the pricing model hard to live with, and the levels of customer service to be below where they expect. As with ClickUp, your mileage may vary, but, I, for one, can say I have not experienced poor customer service. However, I do agree that the pricing needs to be updated.

The customizable dashboards in Monday.com are some of the best I’ve used.
If user-friendliness and robust Gantt charts are at the top of your list, look no further than Monday.com. The user interface is gorgeous, thanks to bright colors and easy-to-read fonts.

I can say the same about Monday.com’s dashboards, too, which can be customized with widgets for Gantt charts, financial details, and workload planners, to name a few. New teams will be able to hit the ground running with Monday.com.

Expert Take
If your SMB uses multiple software solutions, you may want to look closer at Asana, as it offers over 100 native integrations. The important distinction here is that native integrations are made by Asana and the other software platforms, not by a random third party. All of Asana’s native integrations are also free, which is a win. Of course, Asana offers powerful Gantt charts that can help you plot projects using the critical path method, or can be used for Waterfall projects too. They’re easy to use and support dependencies and milestones.
Asana offers over 100 native integrations for free.
Users will also find Kanban boards, to-do lists, and calendars to track work, and there are collaborative notes, a proofing tool and a slick automation builder that allows users to build automated cross-platform workflows. Asana is easy on the eye, which makes using it enjoyable, but you will pay more for Asana than for other platforms. Asana does offer one of the best free project management software plans, but the paid plans most SMBs will be interested in are costly, ranging in price from $13.49 to $30.49 per user when billed monthly.

Asana’s robust suite of project and task management features, its versatility and user-friendliness find favor with many SMB owners and project managers. However, there are equally as many users who have issues with customer service levels, which I feel is warranted, and managing accounts in general. It appears that users love the software, but are growing weary of poor customer service.

Asana’s Gantt charts support dependencies and are easy to configure.
I have used Asana to help plan simple and complex projects. I have always found it easy to switch views, use task management tools, and configure integrations and automations. It has a flat learning curve, meaning anyone can jump in and create projects quickly. I appreciate the desktop applications, and for the most part, enjoy using the mobile apps, but be warned, Gantt charts are missing. Also, if you use the Android app, know that it is not optimized well and struggles on older devices. Small gripes aside, Asana is a solid platform.

If Gantt charts are your jam, GanttPRO is a platform you should explore. While it’s not the most intuitive software, there’s no denying that the GanttPRO Gantt experience, once you learn how to use the software, is hard to beat. You can develop complex charts with multiple tasks, dependencies and milestones. You can attach files to tasks, leave comments for team members, easily adjust start and finish dates and view overlapping tasks without breaking a sweat. You can also use project templates to get started quickly.
GanttPRO comes packed with resource and workload management tools.
GanttPRO also offers myriad project management tools that include time and budget tracking features, Kanban boards, calendars, resource management tools, a few integrations, custom fields and auto scheduling. There are detailed project reports and mobile apps, too. Unfortunately, GanttPRO does not offer a free plan, but paid plans are reasonable. You’ll pay between $9 and $24 per person with monthly billing. If you need strong security and custom user roles, you’ll need to opt for the Enterprise plan, but you must call for a custom quote.

GanttPRO is a platform whose user base greatly appreciates its interface and stout feature set that enables teams to work on traditional and agile projects without breaking a sweat. However, there are rumblings about the platform’s pricing model (particularly regarding additional users) and its poor mobile application, which offers fewer features than the regular version. However, with an overall rating of 9.0, it’s clear that GantPRO users are in love with the platform.

GanttPRO’s charts are very customizable.
Despite having a clean interface, GanttPRO is not the most intuitive software you’ll use. Navigation is fine for the most part, but some options are hidden away behind icons that only appear when you hover the mouse cursor in the right place. Few native integrations and automations are a shame, but the Kanban boards, lists, dashboards and calendars are surprisingly good for a platform that focuses so heavily on Gantt charts. If you have time to learn GanttPRO’s ins and outs, you’ll appreciate what it can do.

If you appreciate flexibility, you’ll get on well with Airtable. Thanks to a robust interface designer, you can create a workspace and workflow that suits your needs. Whether you want to create a workspace with multiple Gantt charts, or a mixture of Gantt charts, lists, boards, grids with attached images, calendars, you can. Airtable’s Gantt charts are intuitive and can be manipulated with simple drag-and-drop mechanics. They provide global project visualization and allow you to plan for constraints when using critical chain project management and plot critical paths.
With the Airtable interface designer, you can create your dream workspace.
In addition to offering task management tools, Airtable provides users with a few integrations with services such as Google Drive, Jira, Slack, and Salesforce, and allows users to create automated workflows and client portals for easier collaboration. Unfortunately, Airtable doesn’t come cheap. The free plan supports five users and limited tools, and the paid plans range in price from $24 to $54 per user per month (billed monthly). The Enterprise plan costs $70 per user, billed annually. These prices make Airtable one of the most expensive options on this list.

If you have the time to sink into creating your ideal workspace, Airtable will delight you. You can truly make Airtable work for just about any type of project in any industry, making it one of the most versatile platforms alongside Coda. I wish Airtable offered more integrations, that automations were easier to use, and that the desktop application could be used offline. Still, whether you use Airtable on the web, via the desktop application, or the mobile app, you’ll be able to get your work done efficiently once you learn how to use it.

If you need capable Gantt Chart software but don’t want to break the bank, you’re in luck, as Zoho Projects offers feature-packed Gantt charts at a very low price. With Zoho Projects, I found it easy to plot critical paths, project timelines and dependencies. Zoho Projects also offers Kanban boards, calendars, and lists, reporting dashboards, integrations, and automations, which is incredible given that prices range between $5 and $10 per user (billed monthly).
Creating detailed Gantt charts in Zoho Projects takes no time.
In addition, Zoho Projects offers an AI assistant called Zia, collaborative pages (documents), whiteboards and a nifty instant messenger for quick team communication. Zoho Projects also integrates with other Zoho platforms, such as Zoho Books, Zoho Sprints, and Zoho CRM, and this is where the rub is. Zoho Project’s prices are so cheap because Zoho wants to hook you into every platform, which is not a bad thing. But keep in mind that costs will spiral if you sign up for the many platforms Zoho offers.

Zoho Projects, an affordable project management solution, is lauded for its comprehensive feature set, integrations, and task and cost management tools. While many find Zoho Projects easy to use, some think it’s unintuitive, clunky and difficult to manage, especially when it comes to creating dependent tasks. As I mentioned, Zoho Projects is not the best-looking software, which may be the cause of these feelings. My advice is to take advantage of the free plan to see if you can live with the software.

Zoho Project’s interface values function far more than form.
Zoho Projects, in terms of design, is a far cry from the likes of monday.com and Teamwork.com, but don’t let the bland interface discourage you.

Whether you’re making Gantt charts, adding assignees and due dates to tasks, chatting, or working on collaborative documents, you’ll never feel lost or overwhelmed.

Expert Take
Coda is a unique project management and Gantt chart software solution. Instead of offering siloed tools, every feature Coda offers comes together in one collaborative hub (workspace) that ensures every team member is literally on the same page. You can add Gantt charts and timelines that let you visualize tasks, road maps, Kanban boards, lists, collaborative documents, and reports. Coda also offers numerous packs (integrations), supports automations and has a handy AI assistant that can help create content.
You can place all of Coda’s task tracking tools in one collaborative workspace.
Coda’s pricing model is also quite unique and should appeal to many SMBs. Instead of charging for every user, Coda only charges for doc makers (document owners). Every other editor (user) can work for free. Coda offers a free plan that supports one doc maker, unlimited users and a handful of tools. Paid plans range in price from $12 to $36 per doc maker per month when billed monthly. If you can get by with only needing one or two doc makers, you can save a significant amount of money by using Coda.

You can add many different types of graphs and reports to Coda’s workspaces.
Many using Coda for the first time will feel quite overwhelmed with the sheer number of options to create the perfect workspace for their team.

Once placed, views are easy to update with tasks, assignees, and due dates, collaboration on documents and reports is effortless and communication happens quickly. If you learn how to get the most out of Coda, you’ll never want to go back to siloed work tools.

While many real-world users of Teamwork.com appreciate its intuitive design, suitability for client-facing work, extensive features, such as time tracking and integrations, and top-notch customer support, many cannot overlook frequent performance issues and billing problems. I have not encountered any performance issues personally, but I do agree with the sentiments surrounding customer service.

Testing Insights
You can make Teamwork.com’s Gantt charts as simple or as complex as you like.
Teamwork.com is the only other project management tool that rivals monday.com regarding ease of use. The user interface is well-designed, making it easy to navigate, create task views, and configure automations and integrations. I even found using financial tools, which can often be overwhelming, to be straightforward on Teamwork.com. There’s nothing complex for anyone to deal with, so I would recommend Teamwork.com to old and new teams. As long as you can afford the heavy premium, I think you’ll be very happy with what this platform can do.

Expert Take
While Smartsheet might not offer the prettiest Gantt chart ever designed, it supports dependencies, tasks can be dragged and dropped to new start and end dates, you can view critical paths and even see the percentage of task completion. Smartsheet also offers Kanban boards for agile workflows and, of course, robust spreadsheets that support cell linking across sheets. Automations and integrations are here, and so is a helpful AI tool that can help generate formulas. If you’re managing projects with large datasets, Smartsheet is a solid option.
The Gantt charts in Smartsheet aren’t pretty, but they work well.
The problem with Smartsheet isn’t so much the software and how it functions — it’s the blatant cash grabs for tools that competing platforms include in their plans, such as good customer service, document and resource management systems, and advanced calendars. Smartsheet doesn’t offer a free plan (only a 30-day trial), and while the paid plans SMBs will be interested in look affordable at $12 to $24 per user when billed monthly, the add-ons can raise the cost significantly.

Many Smartsheet users wax lyrical about the platform’s versatility, robust project management features, and integration capabilities, and they should; Smartsheet excels in these areas; however, many decry the platform’s steep learning curve, cost and levels of customer support. As I mentioned above, smartsheet is a fine platform for those with extensive spreadsheet experience. If this is not you, I suggest looking elsewhere.

Testing Insights
Smartsheet offers timelines as well as Gantt charts.
For the most part, users of Smartsheet won’t run into too many problems, as long as they have a good working knowledge of spreadsheets and formulas. Sure, you can use Smartsheet without having this knowledge, but then I would steer you to a platform that doesn’t put spreadsheets first, such as ClickUp. You can use Smartsheet’s AI tool to create formulas for you, which take out some of the sting. But while the Gantt charts, boards, and automations are fine, you’re better off elsewhere unless you need to manage complex datasets.

Expert Take
If you manage large teams and projects at scale, Wrike, with its myriad administration, privacy, and security features, is the platform for you. You can create private workspaces to keep out prying eyes, configure custom user types efficiently and set multiple security policies that can help protect your data. Of course, Wrike offers excellent, easy-to-read and use Gantt charts and very serviceable Kanban boards, lists and calendars for task management.
Wrike’s clean interface helps make its Gantt charts shine.
Like many other do-it-all project management software solutions, Wrike offers AI, integrations and automations, document and image proofing tools, whiteboards for collaboration, detailed reports and resource management features that can help you ensure projects are delivered on time. Wrike offers a decent free plan that supports unlimited users and paid plans that range from $10 to $25 per user when billed monthly. Unfortunately, Wrike, like Smartsheet, offers many costly add-ons, which could quickly increase your outlay, so keep this in mind.

For the most part, Wrike receives very good reviews from those using it in the wild, especially for its ability to handle project management for large enterprises and its collaboration capabilities. While overall, Wrike is seen as a tool that can improve productivity, many don’t like the user interface or the way it handles integrations and automations (those will be the costly add-ons I mentioned). The consensus is that if you have time to learn how to maximize its features, Wrike will serve you well.

Testing Insights
Wrike’s Kanban boards can be customized to suit many workflows.
While Wrike is nowhere near as polished or as flashy as platforms such as Teamwork.com and monday.com, it holds its own very well. The user interface, while a little bland, feels clean and airy, and thanks to nicely-placed tool options and drop-down menus, navigation is headache-free. I found the Gantt charts in particular pleasant to use. Adding tasks takes no time, and its design simplifies finding critical paths. Some of Wrike’s tools, such as the collaborative docs and whiteboards, have a learning curve, but overall, it’s nice software to use.
Methodology
Software testing is a serious business. So, to give software platforms a fair trial, I use our proprietary rubric to help rank multiple features and test the top platforms. For the best Gantt chart software, 17 platforms were chosen and 46 features across seven categories were analyzed. I then tested the top 10 platforms. Each provider was then awarded a final score. Below are the categories and features tested, with the percentage of weight awarded to each.

We analyze all plans that providers offer and determine if SMBs truly get their money's worth based on the tools provided and the cost per user per month when billed monthly and annually.
Collaboration Tools
12%
During testing, I use all available collaborative tools, such as real-time docs, whiteboards, proofing tools, file storage, and messaging features to see how easy they are to use and whether or not they work across multiple platforms (web, desktop and mobile) if available.

I reach out to each provider's customer service team by all available methods (phone, live chat and email, and ticketing system). I determine how quickly they respond to my questions and how knowledgeable they are about the products they support.
Security and Privacy
5%
During testing, I ensure that providers offer adequate security and privacy features by ensuring two-factor authentication and SAML and single sign-on tools are available and that users can set custom roles and user permissions. I also investigate to see what encryption methods are used, and whether or not platforms conform to privacy laws.

How To Choose the Best Gantt Chart Software
Before signing on the dotted line for new Gantt chart software, there are many things to consider. You must ensure that the software not only offers robust Gantt charts but also all the other tools you need from project management software, its ease of use and how much value it provides. Below, I’ll share some hints, tips and advice on how to navigate the tricky landscape of Gantt chart software.
Essential Gantt Chart Software Features
Aside from Gantt charts that can help you plot projects, subtasks, dependencies, and milestones, you need to make sure that any project management software you choose offers everything you need to get projects across the finish line. At a minimum, Gantt chart software should offer the following:
Task Management tools. Gantt charts are great, but they aren’t the be-all, end-all of task management. Any project management software worth your time should also offer access to Kanban boards, lists, calendars, and even spreadsheets to help you plan, organize and track tasks from start to finish.
Collaboration features. If you can’t collaborate with team members, stakeholders, and clients efficiently, your project will likely fail. Ensure any software you choose offers a robust communication system in the form of commenting or an instant messenger, and features such as collaborative docs, whiteboards, document and image proofing tools to help keep the project rolling. These tools are especially useful for distributed teams.
Subtasks and dependencies. Every project management platform that I can think of offers support for subtasks and dependencies, but support is not always available in every plan. If you need to use subtasks and dependencies, ensure they are offered in the plan that you can afford.
Integrations. Many SMBs use multiple platforms to do everything from manage finances, brainstorm, create email marketing campaigns and design assets. The last thing you want to do is use project management software that doesn’t play nicely with your current software. Check provider websites as they list what integrations are available and whether or not integrations can be created with Zapier.
Automations. Recurring tasks and automations can help save you time, increase productivity and reduce waste. Double-check to see if the project management software you’re interested in offers these features in a plan you can afford.
Project Templates. If you’re new to project management software or Gantt charts, project templates can help put you on the path to project success. Providers such as monday.com, Teamwork.com, ClickUp and Smartsheet list what project templates are available. Check to see if what you need is offered.
Finance and resource management tools. Tracking tasks and their due dates and collaborating is one thing, but if you cannot also manage budgets and resources, your project will likely experience scope creep (runaway due dates and blown budgets). Ensure the software you want to use offers robust budgeting and resource management tools that can help keep your project on track.
Value
While I can provide you with Gantt chart software options, only you know how much money you have to spend on software and what features and tools you need for your projects. Fortunately, most providers list the price of each of their plans on their websites and breakdown costs based on monthly and annual fees per user. Before signing up for any plan, you must ensure you can afford a particular platform’s plans and check that it offers everything you need.
Take into account whether or not you can only afford subscriptions one month at a time, or if you can afford annual plans. If you can afford the latter, you’ll find that you can generally save a significant amount of money, but should your need for the software diminish, you will not be able to reclaim much or any of the money you paid up front. You’ll also find that some providers offer discounts to nonprofit organizations or educational institutions. My advice is to shop around and look at the prices and available discounts for multiple vendors before making a final decision.
Ease Of Use
The Gantt chart software with the most features  in the world will be worthless if it is not easy to use. I strongly recommend that potential users take advantage of free trials. By doing so, you and your team can get your hands on the software and see if it works for you. I also recommend interacting with a provider’s customer service team to see how helpful they are and getting stuck into a provider’s knowledge base to see if well-written, easy-to-follow user guides are available.
Which Gantt Chart Software Is Best For Your Business?
If, after reading the provider summaries and testing insights above, you still cannot figure out which platform to try, consider the following:
If you have a small software budget, look at ClickUp, Zoho Projects, GanttPRO, and Coda, as they offer very affordable paid plans.
If you have no budget for Gantt chart software, try ClickUp, Teamwork.com, Asana, and Coda, which offer exceptional free plans. Just be aware that some providers may limit the use of certain tools.
If you manage a remote team, look to ClickUp, Zoho Projects, Teamwork.com and monday.com as they offer robust collaborative documents, whiteboards and powerful messaging tools.
If you’re new to Gantt charts or project management software, I recommend monday.com, Teamwork.com, ClickUp and Zoho Projects. They are user-friendly, provide premade templates and have excellent user documentation and support.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
What is Gantt Chart Software?
Gantt chart software allows project managers, their teams, stakeholders, and clients to plot and see various tasks and milestones on a horizontal calendar. Gantt charts offer one of the best visual representations of a project.
Is Gantt Chart software free to use?
Some project management software providers offer free versions of their software that include Gantt charts. However, many put Gantt charts into their paid plans as they are considered advanced workflow management tools.
Are Gantt Charts and timeline views the same thing?
No, while Gantt charts and timelines look similar, they’re not the same. Gantt charts are far more detailed and show a project’s main tasks and subtasks, dependencies, milestones, start dates, due dates and any task overlaps. Timelines are simplified and show only a high-level view of main tasks with start and end dates.
Is Gantt chart software worth the price?
It all depends. While you can create Gantt charts in Excel, it is very time-consuming and often involves complex equations. If saving time and being more efficient is more important to you than saving a few dollars, then yes, Gantt chart software is worth the expense.
