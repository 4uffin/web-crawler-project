Whether your business is in the planning stages or is firmly established, it may benefit by being formed or reformed as a limited liability company (LLC), which is also referred to as a limited liability corporation. LLCs offer a higher level of financial and legal protection for their owners than a sole proprietorship or partnership, while providing tax and management benefits over forming as a corporation. While LLCs are usually easier to form than corporations, businesses can reap considerable benefits by tapping the expertise and speed of LLC services.
Our review of the best LLC services identifies the optimal option for many types of SMBs. A company that wants to combine LLC formation with other legal and business services will find an all-encompassing service such as Rocket Lawyer or LegalZoom fits the bill, while startups or smaller businesses can save money by opting for the state-fee-only formation services available from Inc Authority and Bizee. The sweet spot between these two categories are low-cost packages from Northwest Registered Agent and Filenow, both of which throw in a year of free registered agent service.

Expert Take
Most new businesses are able to handle the legal obligations of starting a company without having to consult an attorney. It usually doesn’t take long for a situation potentially involving legal liability to arise, however. Using Rocket Lawyer’s subscription legal service to form your LLC ensures that you’re prepared to address the legal aspects of running a business.
You’ll have to pay a little extra for a subscription to Rocket Lawyer’s Rocket Legal or Rocket Legal+ plans, which cost $39.99 and $19.99 a month, respectively (the Legal+ plan is billed annually). The value that you’ll realize from this investment will accrue over time as you take advantage of the range of legal services the products offer, starting with Rocket Legal+’s free LLC formation option (the Rocket Legal plan charges $99.99 plus state fees for your first LLC, corporate or nonprofit registration).
Unfortunately, you don’t get much of a break on Rocket Lawyer’s registered agent service when you form your LLC. The Rocket Legal+ plan charges $124.99 a year to act as your business’s registered agent, and Rocket Legal’s registered agent service is priced at $249.99 a year. However, both subscription plans include unlimited business and legal documents, RocketSign for e-signatures and online answers to your legal and tax questions.

Pros & Cons

Unlimited access to business and legal documents with both subscription plans
Legal consultations start at only $74.99 for each 15-minute session (with Legal+)
Registered agent service costs $249.99 a year (50% off with Rocket Legal+)

Expert Take
Forming an LLC is something a business wants to get right the first time. ZenBusiness gives new LLCs an added level of confidence by backing up its service with a 60-day money-back guarantee on top of its 100% accuracy guarantee that applies to its free and paid LLC services, and one year of free worry-free compliance alerts ($199 a year subsequently). The company’s Pro and Premium plans, which are priced at $199 and $299 a year plus state fees, add rush filing service and one-day processing of your formation paperwork.
The money-back guarantee excludes state filing fees and other third-party fees, but any ZenBusiness products that are serviced by a third party, such as 1-800Accountant and LegalShield, are covered by 30-day money-back guarantees, with the exception of any completed consultations.
Included with the company’s worry-free compliance service are annual report filings, two free amendment filings each year and alerts for upcoming compliance and filing deadlines. Should your business lose its good standing with the state, ZenBusiness works with you to devise an action plan for restoring your standing.

Expert Take
Tailor Brands is one of several LLC services in our rankings that offers free formation services, but the company stands out for its support of new businesses, especially first-time entrepreneurs, with its free business coaching program. In addition to providing one-on-one sessions with a business trainer, the program offers a 100-day self-paced business skills training program and monthly interactive workshops led by industry experts.
The company will also devise a custom business plan for its LLC customers that covers financial planning, marketing and goal-setting. The financial plan for your new company creates a weekly work schedule focused on your goals, assistance with planning your website and social media marketing, and an analysis of your business’s compliance requirements.
The business coaching program is included with Tailor Brands’s free formation package as well as its two paid plans: Essential is priced at $199 a year and includes compliance assistance, two-day processing (rather than the free plan’s 14 days) and an operating agreement, while Elite costs $299 a year and adds a website for your business, one year of free domain registration and several business branding tools.
Pros & Cons
Business coaching service with fees-only LLC formation gives startups a leg up
Coaching includes a detailed financial plan and online marketing assistance
All packages include a 30-day trial of the company’s invoicing and bookkeeping product
No corporation or nonprofit formation service

Expert Take
The free (state fee only) LLC formation service available from Inc Authority stands out from the free plans offered by five of the other LLC services in our rankings for two reasons in particular. It includes your choice of an EIN or 24-hour expedited processing (each priced at $49 when purchased separately) as well as a year of free registered agent service, which renews at $199 a year.
Inc Authority throws in 30-day free trials of its website builder ($49 a month thereafter) and compliance service ($97 a year after the trial). You also get a domain name for one year. The price you pay for the “free” services is having to slog through Inc Authority’s interminable checkout process, which requires that you click through pitches for an $89 operating agreement, a $99 legal documents package, minutes and resolutions for $99, five business email addresses for $10 and business checking and credit card.
Just when you think you’ve finally reached the checkout screen, up pops an offer for a Business Essentials package priced at $77 that bundles an EIN (which is included with the free plan), operating agreement and web domain. The good news is that once you make it to the checkout, the only item you’re certain to see listed there is your state’s filing fee.
Learn more: Read our full Inc Authority review.
Pros & Cons
Choice of EIN or expedited processing with fees-only LLC formation
30-day free trials of the company’s website builder and compliance service
One year of free registered agent service included with free LLC plan
Nonstop pitches for service upgrades during the checkout process
Homepage pitch of both free EIN and expedited service is misleading (it’s either/or)

Expert Take
Many LLCs are formed by brand-new businesses or by companies that previously operated as sole proprietorships or partnerships. All states require that LLCs designate a registered agent to be available at a physical address in the state during normal business hours to accept official documents. That’s why LLC formation and registered agent services are commonly purchased together. It’s also why so many LLC services offer a free year of registered agent service with their LLC formation plans.
Northwest Registered Agent gives new LLCs a combination that’s difficult to beat: fast LLC registration for only $39 plus state fees and one year of free registered agent service from one of the best in the business ($125 a year afterwards, with a 20% discount for five or more state registrations).
The company’s sole plan includes an LLC operating agreement and 90-day free trials of its web hosting service ($9 a month thereafter), a free domain name for one year (up to $25 a year subsequently) and 90 days of free business email and phone service (each $9 a month after the trial period). You can bundle the web hosting, email and phone services for a 20% discount.
If you prefer to register your LLC yourself, Northwest lets you create a free account that gives you access to the company’s registration tools and all required state forms. Add-on services sold by the company are unlimited U.S. mail forwarding for $20 a month (limited mail forwarding is included with the standard LLC plan), virtual office services in 12 states for $29 a month and EIN registration for $50 ($200 for non-U.S. citizens).

Expert Take
It can be a challenge for new LLCs to manage their compliance obligations, yet failing to meet state and federal filing deadlines and other requirements can lead to hefty fines. Bizee’s LLC formation service helps companies avoid late fees and other filing-related expenses by providing them with lifetime compliance alerts for their annual report filing with the state, federal beneficial ownership information report (BOIR) and amendments to their state LLC records.
For an added fee, Bizee offers Coverdash’s business insurance products that meet all state requirements for specific industries. It also sells a $99 business license research package that ensures your company has all the licenses and permits required by state and federal regulations.
The free LLC formation plan from Bizee comes with a year of free registered agent service ($119 a year thereafter), and one month of free virtual address service ($29 a month subsequently). Its two paid LLC packages are Standard at $199 plus your state fee, and Premium for $299 plus your state fee, both of which charge $50 for expedited two-business-day filing in place of the standard four weeks.

Expert Take
If your new business is ready to open its doors, waiting for your LLC formation documents to be processed can be expensive. You can reduce your wait time by taking advantage of the fast processing included with BetterLegal’s LLC service, which costs $299 plus the state filing fee and promises to turn around your application in two to three business days in most states. The company’s terms of use clarify that the processing time is an estimate that varies based on how quickly the state completes its work on the application.
BetterLegal’s single LLC formation service comes with most of the capabilities you’ll need to launch your business, including an EIN, operating agreement or bylaws and banking resolution. It adds several extras, such as a business website, checking account, insurance evaluation and tax consultation. For an added fee, you can purchase registered agent service for $12.50 a month or $120 a year, state compliance service for the same price and permit and license searches for $125.

Pros & Cons
LLC formation processing completed as quickly as two to three business days
Single formation plan includes all services most new LLCs will require
Includes a free tax analysis and business insurance assessment

New LLCs that want to reduce their startup costs can save on legal fees by using LegalZoom’s extensive collection of legal document templates.

One free year of access to the collection is included with LegalZoom’s Pro and Premium LLC formation plans priced at $249 and $299, plus state fees, respectively.
If you choose to go with the free Basic LLC package from LegalZoom, you can add access to all 150 of the document templates for $99 or purchase them individually for $59. In addition to articles of organization, Basic provides a session with a small-business specialist, a tax consultation with 1-800Accountant and a business insurance quote from Next. Most new LLCs are better served by the company’s Pro and Premium offerings, which add an operating agreement and EIN, along with a Wix website and the ability to customize the legal forms in LegalZoom’s document library.

Expert Take
It may seem counterintuitive, but many businesses will find that they can’t afford to go with an LLC service’s free plan. Forming an LLC entails so many different requirements that choosing the DIY option may end up costing your business more in time and trouble than if you had paid to let the pros handle the process. With Filenow’s Starter and Premium LLC packages, you can get your company going with only a little lightening of your pocketbook.
For $49 plus state fees, Filenow’s Starter gives you two important features that free plans don’t offer: state compliance alerts and 24/7 live support. You can purchase an EIN for $75 and an operating agreement for $50, or simply upgrade to the company’s Premium product that includes both, along with a free year of registered agent service ($119 a year subsequently), a bank resolution, business contract templates and 24-hour processing for only $199 plus state fees. Same-day expedited processing with the state can be added to either plan for $75 to $150, depending on the state.

Methodology
To determine the best LLC services, we tested 32 LLC formation products sold by 12 different vendors in 20 categories. Key factors in our scoring included the product’s annual cost and its provision of articles of organization, business name search and add-on registered agent services. I then put the 10 LLC services with the highest score through a hands-on evaluation to test how easy it is to sign up, how responsive the company is to support questions and the accessibility and usefulness of its main features. My expert take highlights the one aspect of each service that makes it stand out from the pack and the type of business each is best suited to.

How To Choose the Best LLC Service
The best LLC services for SMBs provide a range of registration options to meet the specific needs of different types of businesses. Startups, single-person LLCs and very small companies are typically best served by a fee-only LLC service that helps them with the basic state paperwork such as articles of organization and a banking resolution that allows them to open a business bank account.
Slightly larger companies tend to be best served by a midrange plan that adds an EIN for tax filing and an operating agreement for the LLC, which is required in only a handful of states but recommended by most others. Larger SMBs will likely need the features offered in the service’s high-end plans, such as access to legal and business document templates, a domain name and website, and tax and legal consultations.
Essential LLC Service Features
The first step in registering an LLC with the state is confirming that your preferred business name is available. All the LLC services we reviewed offer free name availability searches, although some, such as Bizee, go further by suggesting names based on your industry or a description of your company. Other essential LLC formation features are the articles of organization, an EIN and an operating agreement:
Articles of organization. Every state requires that an LLC file this document that lists the business name and address, along with the name and address of the person who will receive official state and legal documents sent to the company. Most businesses designate a registered agent to serve as their official contact. Some states also require the names of the LLC’s managers or members (owners) and the purpose of the LLC. Note that some states refer to this document as a certificate of formation or similar name.
EIN. This nine-digit number serves the same purpose as a consumer’s Social Security number for business tax purposes. Single-member LLCs can use the member’s SSN, but many choose to use an EIN to distinguish their personal tax filings from their business tax payments. The EIN is required to open a business checking account and to file your employees’ federal income tax payments.
Operating agreement. This document serves as a legal contract between LLC members. It identifies the LLC and its ownership, defines the duties of members and explains the LLC’s structure. In addition to providing basic information about the members, the operating agreement states the company’s elected tax treatment and key procedures as a way to reduce the likelihood of disputes in the future.
The most comprehensive LLC services are offered by our top choice, Rocket Lawyer, which combines business formation with tax advice and other legal and business services for a single subscription price. A single LLC or other business formation is included with the company’s Rocket Legal+ plan and costs $99.99 with its Rocket Legal subscription.
Businesses that want only LLC formation assistance are well served by vendors such as Northwest Registered Agent, which includes a year of registered agent service with its LLC service priced at $39 plus state fees, and Bizee, whose $99 Business License Package (plus state fees) comes with the company’s lifetime compliance alerts.
Value
Apart from Rocket Lawyer’s subscription model, the prices of the LLC services we reviewed are similar, which means pricing is less of a determining factor for LLC formation than other business services. For example, most of the LLC services in our best list offer basic formation assistance for only the applicable state fees.
While Northwest Registered Agent and Filenow stand out for their low-cost LLC services ($39 and $49 plus state fees, respectively), several of the vendors we evaluated sell a midrange package priced between $99 and $199 plus state fees, and a high-end plan costing between $199 and $299 plus state fees. These include Active Filings, Tailor Brands and ZenBusiness.

Which LLC Service Is Best for Your Business?
The best LLC service for organizations at the startup stage will likely be a free (state filing fees only) or low-cost option that provides bare-bones service such as business name search, articles of organization and assistance with preparing and filing the necessary paperwork with your state.
For already-established businesses that want to convert to an LLC, the best option may be an LLC service that combines formation assistance with other business services such as registered agent service, business banking and a domain name/website combination (even if they already have a site for their business). Having most or all of their business services bundled often is the simplest and most economical option, although this isn’t always the case.
The downside of going with an all-encompassing service such as Rocket Lawyer’s subscription model or BetterLegal’s $299 package (plus state filing fees) is the potential of buying more service than your business needs. It may be cheaper and more effective for a new business to purchase only the LLC services it requires and deal with ancillary features only when they need them.
The high-end offerings from BetterLegal and Rocket Lawyer charge extra for registered agent service, while Northwest Registered Agent and Filenow provide one year of free registered agent service with their low-cost plans. Similarly, Inc Authority’s fees-only LLC service comes with your first year of registered agent service for free, as well as digital storage and delivery of your legal documents and assistance with tax and financial planning. These low-cost options can provide great value to startups and small businesses operating on tight budgets.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
What is an LLC Service?
An LLC service helps a business organize as a limited liability company, which may also be referred to as a limited liability corporation. The services assist the business in preparing and filing the documents and other paperwork required by their state to apply for LLC status.
Other services offered by the vendors include access to and help with their operating agreement or bylaws, EIN for tax and banking purposes and compliance with applicable state and federal regulations. Ancillary services available from some LLC vendors include business bank accounts, tax and legal advice, websites and access to a library of business and legal documents.
What are the pros of forming an LLC?
The primary benefit of forming your business as an LLC rather than a sole proprietorship or partnership is the protection an LLC offers its members (owners) against being personally liable for the business’s financial and legal obligations, with some limits (thus the name).
LLCs are taxed without the double taxation of other corporation types. The business’s profits and losses “pass through” directly to the members rather than going first to the corporation itself and then distributed to shareholders. LLCs are also easier and less expensive to form than corporations, and they are subject to fewer management and financial regulations than corporations.
Are the cons of forming an LLC?
One disadvantage of an LLC is that it can be more difficult for the company to attract investors than when they form as a corporation because they can’t issue stock the way a corporation does. Instead, they are funded by investments from members, so growing may require additional investment from existing members or adding new members. Also, LLC profits are taxed annually whether or not the members take a distribution from the corporation, so they may be liable for the LLC’s taxes without receiving funds from the company.
Since LLC members are categorized as self-employed, they must pay directly for federal services such as Social Security and Medicare. This can take a substantial bite out of the LLC’s available capital and impact its operation or slow its growth. Some states apply an additional tax on LLCs that’s called a capital values or franchise tax and isn’t levied on corporations in the state. This tax may be a flat fee or a percentage of profits and revenue.
