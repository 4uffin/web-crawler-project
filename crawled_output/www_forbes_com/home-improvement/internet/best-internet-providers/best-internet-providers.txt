In 2025, home internet is vital for many jobs, as well as entertainment and communication with friends and family. A recent Pew Research Center study found that 79% of American adults have a home internet plan. With this widespread adoption and reliance on home internet, it’s more important than ever to find the best home internet plan for your needs.
To come up with our ranking of the top internet providers, we carefully evaluated all of the companies based on speeds offered and plan costs, as well as details like data caps, contract requirements and equipment fees. We also factored in our Consumer Sentiment Analysis, which takes real insights from actual customers, along with customer survey data that reflects real-world experiences, to grade the companies on a few key areas.
Why you can trust Forbes Home
The Forbes Home team is committed to bringing you independent, unbiased ratings and information. We use data and expert advice to inform all of our content. For this article, we evaluated 26 national internet providers offering a variety of connection types, including fiber, DSL, cable, fixed wireless, satellite and 5G home internet services. We then scored them against 79 different attributes, including pricing, availability, customer reviews and more. Plus, our advisory board of licensed professionals fact-checks and reviews our content for accuracy and relevancy. You can read more about our editorial guidelines and the internet providers’ methodology for the ratings below.

On AT&T's Website
AT&T is one of the most popular choices for internet providers across the country, and it tops our list as the best internet provider of 2025. You can choose from a variety of plans, with speeds reaching up to 5 Gbps. AT&T enables you to use your own equipment or rent some from the company, allowing for a customizable experience. Its services are available in 25 states as of this writing, allowing for a large service range.Learn more: AT&T Internet review	Why We Picked ItAT&T offers a blend of fiber and DSL hybrid plans, and if you can get access to a fiber plan, it can be well worth it. Not only do its fiber plans offer blazing-fast speeds and generally competitive prices, you’ll also benefit from no data caps and no annual contract. We think its non-fiber plans are nothing to sneeze at either, with speeds of up to 300 Mbps and options for DIY installation.Why We Like It AT&T boasts a service length that is long before the internet was even a thought, with 140 years of existence. Because of this, it has a stellar infrastructure in place for customer service, including live chat with a real human, 24/7 phone support and a mobile app. Its Consumer Sentiment scores reflect that, with some of the highest numbers on our list. We also like that it offers bundling options, such as fiber internet and TV options, allowing for discounts and one-stop service.What We Don’t Like The company plans to keep expanding its fiber availability, but it’s too bad that not all customers can experience it. Additionally, the company requires professional installation in some cases, which can cost a minimum of $99.Who It’s Best For Especially if you’re in AT&T’s fiber network and you value high internet speeds with reliable connections, we think AT&T is a great choice.

You might associate T-Mobile only with being a cellular carrier, but the company is also a popular provider of home internet services. Its 5G internet services offer speeds up to 415 Mbps with competitive pricing and perks like no data caps and no contracts.Learn more:
T-Mobile Internet review	Why We Picked ItT-Mobile Home Internet already has fairly good pricing for its speeds, and you can unlock even lower costs if you bundle T-Mobile’s phone services with your home internet. Additionally, its home internet services are easy to self-install in 15 minutes, and its services are price-locked. We think all of this combines to make for great pricing options, especially if you’re already a T-Mobile cellular customer.Why We Like ItThis type of home internet isn’t the most common, but 5G home internet can provide wide availability to many households within T-Mobile’s network. You can also try its services for 15 days and get your money back if you’re not satisfied. You also won’t pay equipment rental fees.What We Don’t LikeBecause T-Mobile’s home internet service relies on its cellular network, you may run into similar issues as you would with your phone, including occasional dropped or downed service in some locations. Its speeds are also not the highest on our list.Who It’s Best ForIf you’re already a T-Mobile mobile customer or are looking to change mobile phone providers, bundling that service with T-Mobile home internet can be a great option. Even if you’re not planning on being a T-Mobile phone customer, its internet pricing is still worth a look.	Consumer Sentiment Index and Customer Survey

Google Fiber Internet review	Why We Picked ItWe like that Google Fiber boasts price transparency and stability, offering the same prices for more than 13 years and displaying costs right on its website without you needing to enter your personal information to get it. It also doesn’t require contracts or rental fees for much of its equipment and installation is free.Why We Like ItGoogle Fiber offers features on some of its premium plans that particularly tech-savvy internet users will appreciate, such as internet battery backup, which allows you to stay connected for up to two hours and a 25% refund on your monthly bill with one plan if your internet connection is down for more than 45 minutes.What We Don’t LikeThe company’s biggest drawback is its service area—it continues expanding, but so far, it most commonly serves metropolitan areas in select states.Who It’s Best ForIf you live in Google Fiber’s service area and need fast internet access, it’s one to consider.

We surveyed 2,200 consumers who purchased home internet within the last two years, and found many positive sentiments about Google Fiber’s service. Of the customers we surveyed, 86% said they would recommend the provider to a friend, with 31% saying they were “extremely likely” to do so. Additionally, 83% of Google Fiber customers we surveyed said they were happy with their upload and download speeds with the company. Google Fiber gets generally good reviews for its high speeds, lack of data caps and reliability. Happy customers also tend to mention its fair pricing when compared to other internet companies. However, more critical reviews mention issues with customer service response times and delays with installation.

Fios is another fiber internet option, so it’s no surprise that it offers high-speed options, but we especially like that it offers value adds like guaranteed pricing for three years, a free router with all plans and bundling options for streamers like Max and Disney+. The biggest perk of this provider, though, is for those who are or want to be Verizon Wireless customers, as it offers the most money-saving options.Read more: Verizon Fios Internet review	Why We Picked ItIf you’re already a Verizon Wireless customer, bundling your services with home internet is a no-brainer in many cases, as you can save roughly $15 per month on your bill with this feature, bringing its lowest plan down from $49.99 to $34.99
in our example location. Its speeds and plans can vary by location, but if you’re lucky enough to live in an area that offers its top-speed plans and you’re a mobile customer, you can get a lot of bang for your buck.Why We Like It Verizon Fios offers price-locking up to five years for its most premium plans and up to three years for even its lowest plan. Each plan offers free equipment options, no annual contracts and no data caps for residential users.What We Don’t Like Right now, access to Verizon Fios internet is fairly limited, only being available in select metro areas of eight states and Washington, D.C., as of the time of this writing. It’s also worth noting that its prices get less competitive without bundling. You also may have to pay an installation fee of $99, though only with some plans, and this is sometimes waived.Who It’s Best For Verizon Fios is best for existing mobile customers who can bundle their internet and mobile bills for the best deal. Even if you’re not a mobile customer, the company may be worth considering, as many plans still represent great deals.	Consumer Sentiment Index and Customer Survey

We surveyed 2,200 consumers who purchased home internet within the last two years and found that many customers had positive feelings about Verizon Fios. Around 85% of Verizon Fios customers surveyed said they were satisfied with the company’s speed relative to its price. Something we noticed is that the company had the largest share of customers that have been with the company for six to 10 years, with 13% of its customers surveyed estimating that’s how long they’ve used this company for internet.Verizon Fios gets largely positive reviews for its speed and reliability in comparison to other internet companies. While there were some mixed reviews, with criticisms of the company’s customer service and pricing, customers seemed largely happy with Verizon’s high-speed internet performance.

Comcast Xfinity is a popular internet service choice for many, in part because of its vast bundling options. Comcast is a massive cable provider, making packages that combine this service with the internet a pretty sweet deal. In addition to these deals, Xfinity is a solid internet service provider on its own, with a wide variety of plans and speeds reaching up to 2100 Mbps.Learn more:
Xfinity Internet review	Why We Picked ItWhether you’re looking to save on a mobile line, streaming service or traditional cable, Xfinity has great options for bundling deals, including saving 40% on Apple TV+, Netflix and Peacock with its StreamSaver deal. And, if you’ve got some gamers in your home, you’ll be happy with the company’s 99.9% reliability and the option for Storm-Ready Wi-Fi that allows you to keep playing with a battery backup for $7 per month
for 36 months.Why We Like ItXfinity offers one of the largest rosters of plans on our list, with speeds starting at a modest 150 Mbps and going up to a lightning-fast 2100 Mbps. You can opt for contract or no-contract plans and choose to lock-in pricing for a set time, which can help you choose the best pricing decisions for you.What We Don’t LikeXfinity’s prices can go up sharply after its introductory fee, as much as $44 per month
after 24 months, in one example we got. You’ll also need to pay a fee for rented equipment and professional installation, and even self-installation comes with a cost. Though there is a data cap on its plans, it’s 1.2 TB, which is enough for you to stream HD movies for 18 hours per day, which is plenty for most households.Who It’s Best ForXfinity is certainly an option to consider for those in its wide-ranging service area, especially for those looking to bundle with its cable packages or take advantage of its discounts on streaming services.

Cox Internet review	Why We Picked ItWe admire that Cox seems to keep customers top of mind with its features. We appreciated that it transparently lists its prices and download speeds for each plan on its website. It also helps that it offers a wide variety of plans, no annual contract and no cancellation fees. For plans above its 100 Mbps plan, you’ll also get the option of free self or pro install.Why We Like It Cox boasts one of the largest service areas on our list, serving 691 areas in the U.S. as of this writing. It also offers bundling discounts if you add on a Cox Mobile plan and you can swap your rented equipment for upgraded tech every three years if you choose. You’ll even have access to 4 million hotspots, so you can access your internet service on the go.What We Don’t LikeThough Cox offers fixed pricing during your promotional period, prices are subject to go up quite steeply after. It’s also worth noting that the company says it offers unlimited data, but in the fine print, it’s limited to 1.25 TB. That’s plenty of data for the average user, but it is worth noting.Who It’s Best ForCox can be a solid choice for those in its service area who want a variety of plans to choose from and who find prices competitive even after the promotional period ends.

We also noted that 69% said they felt the company was transparent when it came to pricing, fees and contract terms, which was a bit lower than some others on our list.

Some customers do note positive experiences with installation, though.

Spectrum Internet review	Why We Picked ItSpectrum’s plans range in starting price from $30 to $70
for your first year, and you can reach speeds up to 1 Gbps, making it a solid choice for many. The provider doesn’t charge for modem rentals, and its Advanced Wi-Fi routers are included with its highest plan, but you can also use your own equipment here if you choose.Why We Like It Spectrum is widely available in 41 states, so you may not have to go through the hassles of changing your provider even if you move. The company also has some of the best bundling options on our list, with a current promotion of one line of Unlimited Spectrum Mobile included for a year with its internet plans.What We Don’t Like As with many providers, Spectrum’s plans can go way up in cost after your first year. Speeds also tap out at 1 Gbps, which is enough for most users, but if you need anything higher, this won’t be your ideal provider.Who It’s Best For Spectrum can be a good option for internet users who find Spectrum to be a competitive price in their market, want the flexibility of no data caps or contracts and are happy with the speeds offered by the company. If you’re already a Spectrum mobile customer or are looking for a new mobile provider, this can also be a great choice.	Consumer Sentiment Index and Customer Survey

HughesNet is a satellite internet provider that serves many areas that other internet providers do not. Though it doesn’t reach the speeds of other companies, it offers fairly reliable internet in rural areas, allowing for streaming, gaming and general browsing.Learn more:
HughesNet review	Why We Picked ItThose opting for HughesNet plans typically don’t have access to cable or fiber internet providers, so its biggest attribute is its wide availability. With speeds up to 100 Mbps, its two internet plan options can be good options in these areas. With HughesNet specifically, you can also add on whole-home Wi-Fi to generally improve your connection and eliminate dead zones, though this will come at a cost.Why We Like It Each of HughesNet’s two plans allows speeds high enough for streaming and internet browsing and comes with unlimited data (though you’ll only have up to 200 GB of priority data before speeds may get lower). You may also be able to save more through certain promotions, like a $200 rebate
that was being offered at the time of this writing. We recommend looking out for savings if you’ve been considering this provider.What We Don’t Like Satellite internet generally has drawbacks like higher latency and higher costs for the speed. HughesNet also charges to rent or purchase its equipment, which can cost as much as $14.99 per month
to rent, or $500
without promotions to purchase. Installation can also cost up to $199.99, though you may also be able to save with promotions here. You’ll also be subject to a two-year contract.Who It’s Best For HughesNet can be a good option for those who live in areas where a satellite provider is the only or the best internet option. For those who are participating in occasional streaming and gaming, it can be a great option to meet those needs.	Consumer Sentiment Index and Customer Survey

What is the Best Internet Provider in 2025?
After extensive research and customer survey insights, AT&T stands out as the best internet provider overall and the best WiFi service provider in our 2025 list. In our survey of 2,200 home internet users, 88% of AT&T customers reported being satisfied with pricing and internet speeds, while 83% said the company resolved any issues and complaints when raised, making it our top choice for home internet services.
T-Mobile also ranked among the top internet providers, with 74% of customers praising its easy installation process and 91% highlighting clear, transparent pricing, making it a great alternative for households prioritizing affordability and contract clarity.
Rounding out the top three best home internet services is Google Fiber, known for its lightning-fast speeds of 1-2 Gbps, with plans that can max out at 8Gbps. In our survey 83% of Google Fiber customers reported being satisfied with their speeds, and 86% would recommend the internet provider to their friends, making it one of the top internet providers for high-speed internet.
How to Choose the Best Internet Provider
Availability
Many internet providers are only available in certain states and certain areas within those states. Most companies will allow you to search for availability and pricing by entering your ZIP code, so we recommend making this a first step when comparing internet providers, as you won’t want to consider a company that doesn’t serve your area.
Pricing, Fees and Contracts
How much you’ll pay for an internet plan is likely one of the biggest deciding factors, but you’ll want to consider the whole picture rather than signing up quickly for the cheapest plan you can find. Consider the cost per Mbps across providers to ensure you get the best bang for your buck. You should also look into factors like reliability, uptime, customer reviews and other factors that might be important to you. Ideally, you’ll want to get the best value rather than simply the cheapest price.
Additionally, read any fine print, as internet companies often offer lower rates for the first year and then prices can skyrocket after. Similarly, you might have to lock into a contract to get the advertised price. Contracts are fairly common with internet providers, so keep this in mind when comparison-shopping. Signing a contract can be limiting because you might need to pay a cancellation fee if you want out before it’s over. On the flip side, signing a contract may allow you to take advantage of lower pricing or other perks, so if contracts don’t scare you, this might be a good thing.
Internet Speeds
Do a bit of research to determine your internet speed needs. If you just do some light browsing, you won’t need as much speed as a household where multiple people work from home. Many sources, including the Internet Speed Test, recommend around 100 Mbps download speed and 10 Mbps upload speed as a good starting point. Many providers will also include general capacities for each of their plans (i.e., explaining that a certain plan is best suited for a specific household size, number of devices or other metrics). You can also call any company you’re considering and get a tailored recommendation.
Once you determine how much speed you’ll need, compare pricing and plans that meet those speeds from any provider you’re considering.
Reliability
If you’ve ever had the internet go out when you’re trying to take an important video call or finally beat the last level in a game, then you know just how important reliability is. Most internet providers will mention their reliability stats on their websites, but you can also check the quality of the connection with free tools once you’re a customer and make adjustments from there.
Whether You Want or Need to Bundle Your Internet With Other Services
You should check out any deals or promotions you can take advantage of when selecting a new internet provider, including bundling. Many companies offer bundling with cellphone plans, streaming services and other services, so keep an eye out, especially if you’re in the market for any of these.
Data Caps
Some plans will include data caps or limits to how much data you can use within the billing period before there is a penalty. You’ll want to read any fine print well to determine if these data caps exist and how they work. For instance, with some data caps, you’ll be charged extra if you go over, and with others, your internet will slow down after a certain point.
What Connection Types You need
If you’re interested in a certain type of internet connection, such as fiber, you’ll want to ensure the providers you’re considering include it. Additionally, if you’re comparing a few different plans and providers, pay attention to the connection types they offer and include it in your decision-making.
Types of Internet Connection
Fiber: Fiber optic internet is the fastest internet type out there, but it will also cost you the most. You’ll often see speeds of over 1 Gbps and very reliable connections when you opt for a fiber plan. Fiber can also give you nearly equal upload and download speeds, which can make for seamless work.
Cable: This internet type is the most common in the U.S. and relies on cable TV wires to provide service. It can give you internet speeds up to 500 Mbps. There are a few different types of cable internet, including hybrid fiber-coaxial (HFC) internet, which you’ll see from a few of the providers above.
Fixed wireless: With this type of internet service, radio signals will transfer your internet data. You’ll often find this in more rural areas, and it can be affected by weather and geographic features, such as hills. You can get speeds of around 50 Mbps with fixed wireless, but speeds can be more variable and are less guaranteed than with other types. Additionally, some of the best wireless internet providers are making strides in improving reliability of their equipment and services.
Mobile network: This type of internet service is the same connection that is sent to smartphones or other similar devices. You can typically get mobile cellular connections, such as 4G LTE, for a fairly low price, and they’re largely available at a wide range of places. However, as you might already know from dropped calls and mobile searches while on the go, these connections aren’t always the most stable.
5G wireless network: This is a subset of mobile network internet and is becoming increasingly common. 5G home internet also uses a wireless internet signal, but with higher frequency waves than your standard mobile network. You can see speeds of over 1,000 Mbps with this type of connection.
Satellite: While satellite internet plans tend to be a bit slow and cost more than other types, they’re typically best for areas not served by other internet options. You’ll need a direct line of sight between the satellite and the receiver in order to make it work, which can be difficult to achieve.
DSL: This type of connection relies on telephone wires and provides fairly reliable service, especially where other internet types aren’t available. You can reach download speeds of around 100 Mbps.
How Much Does Internet Cost?
The average cost of internet per month will vary depending on the company you choose, the plan you pick, the speed and other factors. However, generally, we’ve found internet costs to land at roughly $65 per month, with low costs around $20 and high costs around $300.
We recommend comparing a few plans from a few different home internet providers that serve your area in order to get the best value possible. Another thing to keep in mind is that the price that’s advertised or that you get in your first year may not be your forever price. Read the fine print to determine if and when your price is expected to go up and by how much. If you have any questions, give the company a call.
Internet Provider Red Flags to Look Out For
Very low customer reviews: While customer reviews aren’t frequently sterling for home internet providers, it’s still worth looking at specific complaints and being wary of companies with extremely low scores.
Low reliability: If customer reviews mention frequent outages or you notice your internet drops often within your first few weeks, it’s worth considering other companies, as this can be a sign of trouble.
Reports of large pricing swings: It’s not uncommon for home internet providers to offer acquisition pricing or trial pricing for the first year. However, you should thoroughly research and ask how high the price will go after that time. If a company is cagey about giving you an estimate or the swing is outside of your budget, it can be worth moving on to a different provider.
How We Selected Internet Providers
To pick the best internet providers and determine our rankings, the Forbes Home editorial team compared 25 major internet providers across 79 different metrics, including average plan cost, installation fees and plan speeds. You can find out more about how Forbes Home rates internet providers in our detailed methodology page.
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
What’s considered a good internet speed?
A good internet speed for your home will vary based on the number of people and the internet activity at a given time. The FCC has some general internet speed guidelines that can be helpful. For example, it recommends a minimum download speed of 12 to 25 Mbps for moderate internet use in a household of two internet users at one time.
What is the fastest internet provider?
Google Fiber offers the fastest internet speed on our list at 8 Gbps, but AT&T, Xfinity, Verizon Fios and Cox Communications all offer fairly high speeds as well. We recommend looking into what’s available in your area, as speeds can vary.
How can you best choose between two internet providers?
If you’re choosing between two internet providers, we recommend looking at speed (both the speeds that they offer and how much speed you really need), cost, contract and price-lock requirements and bundling deals to make your best choice. You’ll also want to compare which companies offer the best internet plans for your specific needs and location. Finally, don’t forget to check out customer reviews and ask others in your area for firsthand experiences.
