Founded in Germany in 1999, Qcells is a top solar panel manufacturer specializing in new solar technologies. The company is known for setting industry standards that boost the performance of solar panel cells.Qcells has made breakthrough after breakthrough over the years—the most notable being the creation of 6-inch cells to maximize solar panels’ usable surface areas, the commercialization of PERC solar cells, world-record efficiency levels for multicrystalline cells and the invention of full-square monocrystalline cells, which boosted the power output of traditional solar cells by 3%.Learn more:
Qcells Solar Panels review	Why We Picked ItQcells has the most innovative residential solar panels on the market and boasts an impressive number of features that put the company’s panels above competitors. We like that the maximum efficiency available is 22.5% for residential panels, placing this brand of solar panels at the top in terms of performance.Why We Like It We’re impressed by Qcells’s four-level quality program, which involves electrical safety and construction testing, independent testing from experts and over 40 tests that ensure each solar module is the best of the best. Additionally, Qcells launched its energy storage system in 2016, helping homeowners purchase a complete solar system with backup storage.What We Don’t LikeNavigating Qcells’ website for residential solar panels isn’t the most user-friendly experience. If you’re looking for specific information, you’re better off filling out a form on the company website and speaking to a representative. Customer reviews can be a bit mixed, including on its app.Who It’s Best ForQcells solar panels are best for anyone living in an extreme climate. Be it high heat, strong wind or heavy snowfall, these solar panels have built-in technology to handle the toughest weather conditions without deteriorating as quickly when looking at average solar panels comparisons.	Pros & ConsRigorous product testing and quality control30-year performance warrantyHigh efficiency ratingsOnly offers three residential solar optionsMixed customer reviews on some sites	Customer SurveyWe conducted a solar survey of 1,000 customers, and of those who have Qcells solar panels, 88% were happy with the durability and reliability of their solar systems. Qcells customers also ranked the company more favorably in terms of the number of solar panel repairs they needed compared to other companies. When polled, 68% of respondents didn’t require repairs, which was one of the best percentages compared to other solar panel brands.

Founded in 1997, Trina Solar is a Chinese-owned company that quickly expanded to serve over 170 countries and continues to strive to be one of the most affordable solar panel companies on the market. On top of selling solar panels, the company specializes in TrinaTracker, a smart solution that helps solar panels access as much direct sunlight as possible to maximize solar energy production.	Why We Picked ItTrina Solar offers an impressive seven options for residential solar panel installations, including a panel specifically designed for hail resistance. These options give homeowners the ability to truly customize their solar panel system to their specific needs. The company also prides itself on selling affordable solar panels.Why We Like It What sets Trina Solar apart from the crowd is its unique combination of solar equipment to go with its solar panels. The company carries three different types of solar trackers to ensure your system is fully compatible with the tracker hardware, a smart control system solution and TinaTracker Smart Solution.What We Don’t LikeWhere Trina Solar falls short is in the quality of its solar panels. The company’s residential solar panels have a degradation rate ranging from 0.4% to 0.6%, with a decrease of 1% to 2.5% in the first year. This means that its panels perform more poorly than some of the solar panel companies that rose to the top of our list.For example, top-performing Panasonic and Qcells panels have a degradation rate of 2% in the first year, followed by 0.25% after the first year for the next nine years. Similarly, some of Canadian Solar’s top panels have a rate of 1% in the first year, followed by 0.4% after the first year and through the next 24 years.Who It’s Best ForSolar panel enthusiasts on a tight budget will appreciate Trina Solar’s expansive options.	Pros & ConsCarries seven different residential solar panel optionsOffers three types of solar trackers and other smart solutions25-year power and product warrantyShorter product warranty for some panelsNo live chat optionSlightly lower quality than other top companies	Customer SurveyAccording to our customer survey, 79% of customers with Trina Solar panels would recommend the company to others, placing the company below average when compared to other top solar panel brands. Eighty-two percent of customers were satisfied with the durability and reliability of their solar panels, and Trina Solar scored an 8.1 out of 10 rating for customer service during and after the installation.

Founded in 2006, Jinko Solar has provided solar panels to nearly 4,000 customers for nearly 20 years. The company specializes in module shipments, sending solar panel equipment to over 200 countries. Be it day or night, Jinko also offers an energy storage system to help homeowners get the most out of going solar.	Why We Picked ItJinko Solar takes its product seriously, with over 2,000 research and development professionals and almost 500 patents for N-type TOPCon technology. The company also has an ambitious goal of bringing energy storage solutions to consumers in addition to solar panels.Why We Like ItJinko Solar offers energy storage systems, is a leader in module shipments and has state-of-the-art software through its app that allows you to seamlessly switch between grid-connected and off-grid connection for your solar panels. The company exceeds the traditional 25-year power warranty by upping its warranty to 30 years.What We Don’t Like Jinko Solar has a 12-year product and workmanship warranty for several of its residential solar panels, while some of our other top contenders have 25-year solar panel warranties. Jinko Solar does not operate in Alaska, limiting availability for Alaskan residents to different brands.Who It’s Best ForAnyone who wants tech features that allow them to seamlessly switch from grid to off-grid connections through a smart app	Pros & ConsLeader of shipping solar modules worldwideStrong customer reviews30-year power warrantyLower efficiency ratingsShorter warranty periodsNot available in Alaska	Customer SurveyCustomers in our survey paid an average of $26,700 for their Jinko Solar system, which is higher than some competitors. When it comes to customer satisfaction, however, 81% were satisfied with the performance of their Jinko Solar panels, and 84% would recommend the company to others. Additionally, the company earned a rating of 8.3 out of 10 in customer service.

Canadian Solar started in 2001 and has nearly 25 years of experience manufacturing some of the most powerful solar equipment. The company operates in over 160 countries.Learn more:
Canadian Solar Panels review	Why We Picked ItWe chose Canadian Solar because it has an impressive portfolio of solar panels and equipment, with some of the most powerful solar panels on the market, inverters, solar system kits, e-storage and engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) services. Canadian Solar has some of the highest in-house standards for its solar equipment, opting to test its panels to standards that exceed typical testing requirements by two to three times.Why We Like ItOne of Canadian Solar’s biggest perks is its high-wattage panels. You have nine options for solar panels as of this writing, ranging in quality and price, making it easier to customize your solar system according to your budget and needs.What We Don’t LikeThere’s very little that we don’t like about Canadian Solar. The main downside is that panels have a shorter product and performance warranty of just 12 years. Keep in mind that you might spend more on some of the higher-quality panels, but the amount of power produced could mean you need fewer solar panels for your home.Who It’s Best For Those looking for the most powerful solar panels on the market will be happy with Canadian Solar	Pros & ConsNine different panel options, including high-wattageOffers professional monitoring servicesStrong customer satisfactionShorter overall product and performance warrantyNo live chatLow and infrequent app reviews	Customer SurveyCanadian Solar scored highly in our consumer survey, with 86% of respondents saying they would recommend the brand and were satisfied with their purchase. It also received one of the highest scores for customer service during and after the installation, with an 8.8 out of 10.

Panasonic Solar is an industry giant with over 100 years of experience and a strong reputation for innovation within many different industries, including electronics, batteries, transportation, manufacturing and more. Editor’s Note: Shortly after this ranking was determined, Panasonic announced that it was discontinuing its solar and battery storage lines.Learn more:
Panasonic Solar Panels review	Why We Picked ItWe chose Panasonic Solar for its variety of solar equipment. Because Panasonic also sells solar battery storage options and solar inverters, it’s easier to choose a solar system from the same company instead of having to pick and choose from multiple providers.Why We Like ItPanasonic Solar’s equipment comes with a 25-year warranty for solar panels, performance and labor for the panels, microinverter, inverter and rack system. The company also offers five-year monitoring services.What We Don’t LikeWe don’t like that Panasonic Solar no longer manufactures its own solar panels. On top of that, Panasonic Solar had one of the highest average costs for solar panels in our customer survey. Lastly, although the company is currently selling solar panels and equipment, it recently made an announcement stating it was discontinuing its solar and battery storage lines.Who It’s Best ForThose looking for a wide variety of solar panel equipment may find what they need with Panasonic Solar.	Pros & ConsHigh wind, hail and snow load ratingsLower degradation rates over timeOffers battery storage and hybrid invertersHigh price tagLower efficiency ratingsPlans to discontinue solar panels	Customer SurveyIn our customer survey, Panasonic Solar had favorable ratings, with 83% of people saying they would recommend the company to others. Eighty-four percent were satisfied with the durability and reliability of the panels. Panasonic earned an 8.4 rating out of 10 for customer service. However, out of all the solar panel manufacturers we reviewed in our survey, Panasonic Solar had one of the highest price tags, with an average cost of $27,400. Keep in mind that this is customer-reported data, so you should always get a unique quote.
Other Solar Companies We Considered
The U.S. Department of Energy’s interactive solar manufacturing map shows 30 solar manufacturers with manufacturing sites in the U.S. alone. With so many solar panel manufacturers on the market, we had a few companies that almost made it to our top five best solar panels list, including:
Silfab Solar: This company offers solar panels that perform well in low-light conditions, making it a close runner-up for homes in climates that receive less sunlight than average.
Renogy: This provides some of the widest selections of solar panels on the market, making it a good option for homeowners looking to customize their solar system to the fullest. Keep in mind that all of these panels are designed for DIY install and best for RVs rather than homes.
ZNShine Solar: Another company that offers many solar panel options, including custom frame colors, this company gives homeowners personalized experiences while building their solar systems.

Types of Solar Panels
The secret behind some solar panel types performing better than others is the way they’re made. Here’s a breakdown of the different types of solar panels and how they perform:
Monocrystalline Panels
As we ranked different panels, the panels that performed the best were the ones that used monocrystalline technology, but with a catch. Top-performing panels went above and beyond because they also contained newer technologies, like:
Passivated Emitter and Rear Contact (PERC)
Interdigitated Back Contact (IBC)
N-type layering
P-type layering
These upgrades increase the maximum efficiency of a typical monocrystalline panel by several percentage points in some cases and make the panels more resistant to elemental damage.
Thin-Film
Panels that ranked lower on our list were made of thin film, which is known for its lightweight properties and flexibility, but not necessarily its longevity or high efficiency. This type of panel is made from a variety of materials, some performing better than others.
Polycrystalline Panels
Polycrystalline panels were once popular because they were easier to produce than monocrystalline panels. Instead of using one silicone crystal apiece, these panels contain silicone fragments melted together, which makes them less efficient. New technology has made polycrystalline panels nearly obsolete. 2024 trends from the International Energy Agency (IEA) show that nearly 100% of today’s silicon PV modules are made from monocrystalline panels.
How Much Do Solar Panels Cost?
Your average 6.5 kW solar panel system costs between

Solar Panel Cost Factors
The cost of your solar panels depends on a few factors, such as:
The type of panel: High-quality, Tier 1 solar panels made with the latest technology, like N-type TOPCon monocrystalline solar panels, come at a premium cost, while lower-performing panels using P-type technology may cost less.
The number of watts generated: Panels that produce more watts will cost more upfront, but you might need fewer panels to produce the same electricity as lower-watt panels, making them more economical overall.
The efficiency: Panels that are 22% efficient or higher typically cost the most, while low-efficiency panels less than 20% tend to cost less.
The manufacturer: Solar panel companies offering the latest and greatest solar panel properties often have higher prices for individual panels. However, these higher upfront costs could be offset by panels that perform better than low-cost, less-efficient panels.
How to Pay for Solar Panels
There’s a good chance that you’ll purchase the solar panels from a third-party solar installation company rather than directly from the manufacturer. We recommend working with an installer, as installing solar panels is a heavy, labor-intensive job that can damage your roof or void warranties if you don’t have experience installing solar panels yourself.
The best solar companies offer a variety of payment options, including cash, loans, leases, power purchase agreements (PPAs) or some combination of these methods.
Cash: This method is exactly what it sounds like—paying upfront for the cost of your solar system and installation.
Solar loans: Solar installation companies may offer loans in-house or through third-party companies. This method allows you to own your panels with lower upfront costs than buying outright.
Leases: With solar leases, you’ll pay a set cost each month to use solar energy from panels, but you won’t own them. This means you typically won’t get to take advantage of any solar incentives.
PPAs function similarly to solar leases, only you pay for the energy you produce instead of renting the panels themselves.

Are Solar Panels Worth It?
The overall consensus is yes—solar panels are worth it. We surveyed 1,000 Americans and found that almost 90% were happy with their decision to go solar. On average, solar panels have a return on investment (ROI) of 10%, but if you live in a region that uses more electricity or has higher electricity rates than the national average, you could see an ROI of more than 30%.
At the same time, solar energy isn’t for everyone. The opposite ROI can be said for homes in locations that use less energy. Weigh the pros and cons of going solar for your specific energy habits, climate, home and budget to determine if solar panels are worth the investment.
How Much Money You Can Save Going Solar
Once you break even on the cost of solar panels, you’ll start saving on your electricity bills. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), most households spend around
$137 a month or
$1,640 yearly on electricity. Depending on the size of your system and whether or not you install a solar battery for times when your panels don’t produce electricity, you could see significant savings.
How to Determine if You Should Go Solar
The best way to determine whether or not you should go solar is to calculate your solar panel ROI. Here’s how:
Add up the cost of your solar equipment, labor, inspections and fees.
Deduct tax credits and rebates.
Look at your utility bills to find out how much you spend annually on electricity.
Divide the cost for your solar system after any deductions by your annual electric usage to get the solar payback in years.
Since solar panels have a lifespan of 25 years, subtract your payback period from 25 to get the number of years you’ll have your panels paid off.
Multiply this number by your annual electric bills to see how much you’ll save if your system covers your entire electricity bill.
Subtract the cost of your system after incentives from your lifetime savings.
Divide this number by the cost of the system after incentives and multiply by 100 to get your unique solar ROI.

Solar Panel Tax Credits and Incentives
The biggest solar tax credit is the federal Residential Clean Energy Credit, which gives qualifying homeowners a 30% tax credit on their tax return. The credit is set to expire at the end of 2025, so only systems installed before then will qualify for the credit.
Net Metering
An important factor in determining your savings from solar panels is net metering. Not every state has net metering—only 34 states, Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico have regional or statewide net metering programs. If you live in a state that doesn’t have a program, you may still qualify for net metering through a local electricity or utility company, so be sure to check with your energy supplier to see what they have to offer.
Other Common Incentives
Some states take an ambitious approach toward advocating for renewable energy and offer their own incentives on top of the federal tax credit to help make financing solar panels easier. A few examples include New York’s 25% Solar Energy System Equipment Credit for up to $5,000, and Maryland’s Renewable Energy Credits program. Be sure to talk with your solar installer about any incentives and do your own research too.
Factors that Impact Solar Panel Performance
Keep in mind that your savings depend on your solar panel performance. Here are some of the most common factors that impact the efficiency of solar panels:
Amount of Sunlight
The amount of direct sunlight your panels receive directly influences how much energy your panels produce. If your panels don’t produce enough energy to fully power your house, you won’t save fully on electricity and will need to calculate how much the panels shave off your electricity bills to know your total savings and ROI.
Performance Guarantee
Not every solar panel is equal when it comes to performance. The manufacturing process and materials used can mean the difference between high-efficiency and low-efficiency panels. Overall, monocrystalline solar panels perform better than thin-film solar panels.
Quality
Some solar panel brands have developed panels that are heat-, weight-, snow- and wind-resistant, meaning they won’t deteriorate as quickly under the same circumstances as panels that lack these features.

Solar Survey Insights
We surveyed 1,000 Americans in 2025 who had solar panels installed within the last five years to better understand homeowners’ experiences and reasons for going solar. Here are some of the most important findings from the survey:
The average cost for a solar system was approximately $26,000. Since the average surveyed electric bill is $828 per year, it would take over 30 years for homeowners to break even on solar panels.
A majority of respondents (64%) said they installed panels primarily to save on energy bills. Of our respondents, 67% said they save more than $50 per month, with 15% saying that they saved $120 or more monthly on their bills.
People seem generally happy with how their panels hold up and how they operate, with 31% of respondents rating the reliability and durability of their panels as a 10 out of 10 and 87% saying they were satisfied.
Sixty-six percent of respondents said they considered at least two companies when deciding on a solar panel company, suggesting that choosing the best manufacturer is an important decision that they don’t take lightly.
Many have already paid off their solar panels (24%), and a similar number seemed to have a fairly short expected payback period of two to three years.
A majority of respondents, 57%, said they’ve never had to repair their panels.
