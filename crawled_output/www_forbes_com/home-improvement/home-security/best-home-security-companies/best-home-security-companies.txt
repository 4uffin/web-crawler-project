Brinks Home Security has been in the business for decades, but has thoroughly modernized its offerings to provide the best of both worlds. Brinks is particularly well-regarded for its 24/7 professional monitoring systems.Learn more: Brinks Home review	Why We Picked ItBrinks Home Security checked boxes across the board for company reputation to customer service to product specifications, earning the company our “best overall” designation. With an A+ Better Business Bureau rating and excellent support, we were especially impressed by Brinks Home Security’s commitment to providing responsive care—which is what you want with a home security company.Why We Like ItBrinks Home Security can detect everything we evaluated, including motion detection, fires and carbon monoxide. With 24/7 professional monitoring, your home can be safe and secure whether you are there or not.What We Don’t LikeBrinks’ professional monitoring monthly fees are higher than some other competitors, and the company requires a contract. Customers may incur an early termination fee if they attempt to end a contract early.Who It’s Best ForHomeowners who want complete confidence in their home security monitoring—whether they are home or not—should consider the customizable services that Brinks Home Security offers.	Pros & ConsLive customer service and dispatch centerA+ Better Business Bureau ratingGenerous service planContract required$99 activation feeRelatively high monthly rates	Customer SurveyForbes Home surveyed 1,900 consumers about their experiences with home security companies and our team found overall positive sentiments among those who have Brinks Home Security, with 94% saying they would recommend Brinks to a friend.

SimpliSafe Home Security has established itself as one of the top companies for customizable, DIY-friendly home security systems that are backed by the latest technology. That includes AI-powered cameras that can detect and communicate issues in real-time.Learn more: Simplisafe Home Security review	Why We Picked ItSimpliSafe Home Security stands with features that new customers can appreciate, including no contract requirements and a generous 60-day test run with your new system in place. Equipment comes with a lifetime warranty with select professional monitoring plans.Why We Like ItWith affordable-but-quality professional monitoring available for less than $1 per day, SimpliSafe appeals to both budget-minded customers and those who want top-of-the-line home security components. SimpliSafe also offers mobile app control and smart home integration features.What We Don’t LikeCompared with some other companies’ offerings, SimpliSafe’s smart home integration capabilities are limited—at least for now. Some customer reviews also note issues with self-monitoring and price increases.Who It’s Best ForCustomers looking to balance affordability with functionality should include SimpliSafe in their research. From bundled packages to customizable options and budget-friendly plans for monitoring, SimpliSafe’s systems can be tailored to most needs.	Pros & ConsNo contracts required60-day trial windowLifetime equipment guarantee with some plansLimited smart home integrationMixed reviews of self-monitoringOnly one-year manufacturer’s warranty	Customer SurveyFrom our survey of 1,900 consumers about their experiences with home security companies, Forbes Home found 91% of SimpliSafe customers were satisfied with the value they received for the money they paid. Only 2% of customers would be unlikely to recommend SimpliSafe to a friend.

Cove is an excellent option for customers who want to take home security into their own hands—starting with customizable equipment options designed for easy, DIY installation. With a generous 60-day trial period and month-to-month contracts, Cove’s policies can help new customers feel comfortable before making a big commitment.Learn more: Cove review	Why We Picked ItCove scored well across our metrics that looked at customer service, reviews and ratings, monitoring options, plan prices and more. Overall, we were impressed by the ease of setup and value for the money that Cove offers.Why We Like ItTwo words that come to mind to sum up Cove are customization and flexibility. From designing the system that is right for any personal needs to having the freedom to stop or change service at any time, Cove delivers home security on your own terms.What We Don’t LikeCove now offers select security cameras from the Eufy brand. The equipment alone is excellent, but customers have reported issues getting everything properly synced in their apps and monitoring systems. Cove is also limited on the smart home integration front and, unlike some other companies, there is a fee for self-monitoring.Who It’s Best ForCustomers who want to improve their home security without the commitment of significant installation fees or an annual contract should consider putting Cove’s 60-day trial period to the test.	Pros & ConsProfessional monitoring starts at $17.99 per month60-day trial periodBudget-friendly componentsSelf-monitoring feeOnly one-year manufacturer’s warrantyLimited smart home integration	Customer SurveyForbes Home surveyed 1,900 home security customers and found that 83% of Cove customers would recommend the company to a friend. The same number of respondents were satisfied with the value they received from Cove products and plans, and 80% found the installation process to be easy or very easy.

Founded by a former ADT executive in 2014, Abode promises “effortless integration” with a variety of smart home devices through the Adobe hub—which even has a backup battery to keep you connected when there is a primary power disruption.Learn more: Abode review	Why We Picked ItWith no contract commitment and excellent smart home integration capabilities, we found Adobe to be a solid, customizable option for consumers who value the latest technology.Why We Like ItAdobe’s bundled security systems—Iota Kit, Smart Security Kit and Adobe Security Kit—offer nice gateway points to home security. Adobe also arrives ready to be fully integrated with Zigbee, Z-Wave, Apple HomeKit, Google Home, Alexa, Sonos and IFTTT.What We Don’t LikeAlthough contracts are month-to-month, Adobe charges $74.99 for its annual “Standard Plan,” which is for anyone who wants to self-monitor. Potential customers should understand terms and conditions if they aren’t committed to using Adobe for a full year.Who It’s Best ForDesigned to be simple to install and connect to smart home systems, Adobe is a good fit for anyone who is tech-savvy but still doesn’t want to work too hard to set up their home security system.	Pros & ConsExcellent smart home integrationExtensive programming optionsLow-priced starter packagesSelf-monitoring annual feeDoesn’t include control panelLimited customer service phone availability	Customer SurveyIn Forbes Home’s survey of 1,900 home security users, 86% of Adobe customers were satisfied with the reliability of their system, and 88% would recommend the company to a friend. Among the Adobe respondents, 78% paid what they expected or less for professional monitoring services.

Eufy started as a smart home product company—with vacuums, in fact. Today, its home security components are so well-regarded that even Cove sells Eufy security cameras. As a home security company, Eufy also scores high for its low prices and month-by-month plans.Learn more: Eufy review	Why We Picked ItBudget-conscious customers will like the sound of Eufy’s free self-monitoring or $4.99 per month professional monitoring. Even the top-end plan, Eufy Plus, is just $9.99 per month or $99 per year.Why We Like ItEufy’s self-monitoring service is truly free, which is a rarity in the industry. You don’t have to compromise on the quality of the technology either: Eufy’s solar-powered outdoor cameras start as low as $99, and premium outdoor cameras can even include color night vision.What We Don’t LikeEufy doesn’t offer the same variety of components or services as some other companies, making it a better option for people looking for basic home security. The third-party professional monitoring and limited customer service hours can be issues for some customers.Who It’s Best ForEufy may not have all the bells and whistles with professional monitoring that some other companies offer, but the coverage the company does offer for its low prices will be appealing for anyone who wants to keep monthly rates low.	Pros & ConsFree self-monitoringInexpensive professional monitoringHigh-quality security camerasLimited smart home integrationThird-party professional monitoringLimited customer service phone availability	Customer SurveyForbes Home surveyed 1,900 home security customers and, among Eufy customers, 89% were satisfied with the value they received. Most Eufy customers were happy overall with their experience, and 82% would recommend the company to a friend.

In business for more than 150 years, ADT has earned its stripes as one of the biggest and most recognizable names in home security. At the same time, the company continues to evolve and meet customer priorities—like with video and smart home capabilities.Learn more: ADT Home Security review	Why We Picked ItPutting aside ADT’s reputation, we used our metrics to objectively assess the company’s services, customer support, contract terms and overall reviews. With this methodology, ADT scored highly, with the most notable downsides being the contract requirement and activation fee.Why We Like ItOn the other end of the spectrum from companies that push DIY installations and self-monitoring, ADT is a good choice for consumers who want professional support every step of the way.What We Don’t LikeAlthough ADT offers month-by-month contracts for self-installed and basic plans, professionally installed systems require 36-month contract commitments with rates starting at $34.99 per month.Who It’s Best ForCustomers pay more of a premium for ADT in exchange for top-notch professional services from ADT agents who have an average of seven years of experience.	Pros & ConsExtensive product assortmentProfessional installation and management from ADTExtended limited warranty36-month contract commitment for some systemsPlans start at $24.99 per monthEarly termination fees	Customer SurveyAccording to Forbes Home’s survey of 1,900 home security customers, those who use ADT were more likely to say they valued the brand’s reputation than customers of other brands. Most customers were also happy with their experience—with 86% saying they would recommend ADT to a friend.

What to Look for in a Home Security Company

Depending on what you need, some core features to consider include what type of monitoring, what equipment is used, installation and recurring costs, smart home compatibility and contract terms—among other factors.

Equipment: Does the company offer motion sensors, glass break sensors, smoke or carbon monoxide detectors and/or video surveillance?
Installation: Can the system be self-installed or is professional installation necessary? Is there an installation cost or activation fee?
App & Smart Home Integration: How well-reviewed is the company’s app? Can the system be integrated with smart home devices?
Cost & Contract Terms: What are the upfront equipment fees? What are the monthly monitoring fees? What are the contract terms, and is there a penalty for ending a contract early?
Reputation: What are the company’s reviews across different reviewing platforms?

How Much Does a Home Security System Cost?
According to our research, the average cost to install a home security system is $600. That includes the range from basic, DIY home systems that run about $200 up to comprehensive, professionally installed systems that can be upwards of $1,200. The average cost for a basic whole-home system is $460. This has the most essential equipment to establish your home security system. Costing about $175 each, indoor and outdoor home security cameras were the most expensive single items from the options we reviewed. Video doorbells are another popular addition to home security systems. These cost approximately $170. Smart home features are typically add-ons, and these costs can range from $15 on the low end for smart lighting to $500 on the high end for smart locks.
In addition to equipment costs, installation and activation fees can add to the upfront expense. Depending on the scale and complexity of the system being installed, installation fees can range from $100 to $1,400, making it essential to understand how they factor into the cost before you commit to a new system. Alternately, some companies allow customers to install their own equipment, but they may still be subject to an activation fee. Customers should also factor in the ongoing monitoring fees to their budget, which can range from $4.99 to $59.99 from the companies we recommend.
Some companies offer payment plans or options to help with the initial expense of installing a home security system.
DIY vs. Professional Home Security Monitoring
As you assess home security companies, one of the factors that can make the biggest difference to your budget and overall experience is whether the company offers professional monitoring or if there is an option for self-monitoring. There are advantages and disadvantages to either method, so it’s important to evaluate your needs.
Are Self-Monitored Home Security Systems Adequate?
With a self-monitored home security system, you can avoid monthly fees for professional monitoring, which can be a significant recurring expense. This approach does place the responsibility on you and other designated residents to monitor alerts as they arise. Most systems are integrated with phone apps and in-home alarms, so there are multiple ways to get notified of a potential problem whether you are home or away. If there is a true emergency, you will need to get in contact with authorities on your own rather than have that managed by the professional monitors.
Is Professional Monitoring Worth It?
Home security companies charge an average of $20 to $60 per month for professional monitoring, but this is a price that many people opt to pay for the peace of mind that it brings. Although details vary from company to company and from plan to plan, professional monitoring generally involves alerting remote human agents to a potential issue in the home. They will then attempt to get in contact with the plan owner and, if necessary, will communicate with emergency dispatch. If you regularly travel or go without cell service, professional monitoring can ensure an emergency at your home will be promptly addressed in your absence.
Some renters or homeowners insurance plans offer discounts if your residence is professionally monitored, so that’s something worth inquiring about as you make a decision.
How to Save Money on Home Security
In the course of reviewing 254 different home security systems, we found a variety of ways that people can save money while still improving their home security. This starts when you are considering what equipment to install.
Components: Many companies offer bundled packages that may provide discounts on the components like sensors, cameras and smart doorbells. On the other hand, you can start with an even more basic array by shopping a la carte.
Installation and Activation: If you are confident in your abilities to install your new home security system, look for companies that offer DIY installation options. Professional installation can add several hundred dollars to your upfront costs.
Monitoring: To save money long term, opting for a self-monitored system can allow you to save between $240 and $720 per year compared to fees for professional monitoring. Remember: You can also improve your home security by taking some simple steps around your home and limiting what information you share with others.
Shop Promotions: We found that home security companies regularly offer promotions, which can allow you to save on parts, installation or monitoring fees.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
What cybersecurity risks come with smart home security systems?
By nature of their internet connection, smart home security systems have a certain level of vulnerability to cyberattacks. According to a 2023 study published in the journal Computers in Human Behavior, privacy intrusions are the biggest threat, followed by hacking and malware. To ensure you are protected, review any potential home security company’s policies or ask about what protections they have in place.
Do neighborhood crime rates affect which home security system you should choose?
Consumers in areas with high crime rates may find more benefit from comprehensive, professionally monitored systems. Particular types of equipment that can be helpful include high-resolution cameras with night vision and video recording technology, while features like floodlights and sensors that sound alarms can help ward off would-be intruders.
Do home security systems require a permit?
Permit requirements are put in place by some local authorities to protect community resources against false emergency alarms. Before moving ahead with a home security system, you can check with your local police or fire department. We found that permits can cost between $40 and $550. If you do not get a permit where one is required, you may be subject to fines.
