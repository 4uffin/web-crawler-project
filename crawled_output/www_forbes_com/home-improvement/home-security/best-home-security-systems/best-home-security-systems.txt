The average home security customer is concerned with both personal safety and peace of mind, according to a Forbes Home survey of 1,900 home security customers. Even if your home is never the target of a crime or emergency, simply having a home security system in place can help customers sleep easier at night.
But here’s where it gets a bit more complicated: What makes the best home security system will vary from person to person. Whether you want the best DIY system, the latest technology or simply an affordable solution, there is no shortage of options. In fact, we analyzed more than 250 home security systems to evaluate what the best picks are for a range of personal priorities.
Why you can trust Forbes Home
The Forbes Home team is committed to bringing you independent, unbiased ratings and information. We use data and expert advice to inform all of our content. Plus, our advisory board of licensed professionals fact-checks and reviews our content for accuracy and relevancy.

Cove offers customizable and flexible options to suit just about all needs, and you even get a 60-day trial period to see for yourself. According to a Forbes Home survey, Cove customers reported high levels of satisfaction with the value, ease of installation and overall product experience.Cove can be a fit for customers who want to self-monitor or those who are interested in affordable professional monitoring, which starts at $19.99 per month. Smart home integration is a weakness with Cove compared to other companies we reviewed, but if that isn’t a sticking point for you, Cove should be on your list of options.Learn more: Cove Home Security review	Pros & Cons60-day trial periodAffordable components and monitoringNo contract commitmentsSelf-monitoring feeLimited manufacturer’s warrantyRestricted smart home integration	Customer SurveyIn Forbes Home’s survey of 1,900 home security customers, 83% of Cove customers reported they would recommend the company to a friend.

Standing in contrast to companies that position themselves as DIY-friendly and great for self-monitoring, Brinks’ experience and staffing make it an excellent option for professional services. In fact, professional installation is free with certain plans and there is a 30-day trial period.Brinks earned points for its customer service and has an A+ from the Better Business Bureau (BBB) as of this writing. However, customers pay a bit of a premium for that professional service: 24/7 professional monitoring starts at $39.99 per month and the company does require a significant contract commitment, often of 36 months.Learn more: Brinks Home Security review	Pros & Cons24/7 dispatch centerFree professional installation with some plansHigh customer satisfaction ratingsRequires contractsPricier professional monitoring$99 activation fee	Customer SurveyBased on Forbes Home’s survey of 1,900 consumers about their experiences with home security companies, Brinks customers were highly satisfied, with 94% saying they would recommend Brinks to a friend.

Founded in 2006, SimpliSafe delivers modern solutions like AI-assisted monitoring that can take your home security to the next level while still maintaining affordability. SimpliSafe DIY-friendly products come with 60-day trial windows plus free return shipping, and most customers said they found the installation process to be very easy compared to other companies. If that’s still outside of your comfort zone, SimpliSafe does offer professional installation with perks like lifetime equipment warranties under some plans.Despite its technological innovations, SimpliSafe’s products aren’t highly compatible with smart home systems. Some customers also flagged issues with self-monitoring and price increases, although there are no annual contracts, so you can stop at any time.Learn more: SimpliSafe Home Security review	Pros & ConsAI-powered cameras60-day trial periodHigh customer satisfaction ratingsLimited smart home integrationReports of price increasesMixed reviews of self-monitoring	Customer SurveyFrom our survey of 1,900 consumers about their experiences with home security companies, Forbes Home found 93% of SimpliSafe customers said installation was easy. That correlated with overall customer satisfaction, with 93% saying they would recommend SimpliSafe to a friend, and a full 50% said they were “very likely” to recommend it, which was the best response of any company.

Eufy is a technology company at its core and has some of the best security cameras on the market, including those that are solar-powered or have color night vision. Although prices on those components can run a bit above the average, Eufy customers can expect to save on a monthly basis, either with free self-monitoring, a basic plan that starts at just $4.99 per month, that enables you dispatch authorities with the click of a button, but still requires you to monitor and raise alarms yourself, or a premium plan that involves 24/7 professional monitoring at $9.99 per month.The flip side of Eufy’s tech-first approach is that the company doesn’t offer professional installation, and the monitoring is done by a third-party company. And, despite the product innovations in many ways, Eufy isn’t known for offering the best smart home integrations and sometimes has compatibility issues.Learn more: Eufy Home Security review	Pros & ConsFree self-monitoringLow-cost professional monitoringExcellent security camerasMixed reviews of customer supportOutsources professional monitoringLimited smart home integration	Customer SurveyForbes Home surveyed 1,900 home security customers to understand sentiments toward top brands.

Ring first entered the market with its state-of-the-art video doorbells and while those remain a central piece of Ring’s offerings, the company has grown to have a comprehensive selection of home security components and monitoring options. Boosted in part by its 2018 acquisition by Amazon, Ring has notably strong smart home integration capabilities and features like AI-assisted video descriptions.Ring does offer free self-monitoring, although customers who want video storage will have to pay a fee. Professional monitoring that starts at just $5 per month for smoke and CO protection or more traditional professional monitoring for $10 per month. However, the top tier of professional monitoring is $99 per month.Learn more: Ring Home Security review	Pros & ConsBudget-friendly monitoring optionsAI-assisted notificationsLow component pricesProfessional installation is $159.99Limited product warrantiesVery internet connection dependent	Customer SurveyRing had impressively positive reviews based on Forbes Home’s survey of 1,900 consumers about their experiences with home security companies: Among Ring customers, 93% said they would recommend the company to a friend.

Abode is the brainchild of a former ADT executive who wanted to take technology and smart home integration even further. The resulting systems are designed to seamlessly integrate with a host of smart home brands. The company offers professional installation, but makes it easy to install the components on your own, with 81% of Abode customers telling Forbes Home that DIY installation was simple.Although Abode doesn’t require contracts, it does incentivize them with its deals for annual subscribers: Abode charges $74.99 per year for self-monitoring, in which the user will need to forward the alarm to the monitoring center. This plan breaks down to just over $6 per month. Professional monitoring includes cellular backup and costs $239.99 per year or less than $20 per month with a one-year commitment. You can also go totally subscription-free with a more bare-bones plan that includes live video feeds and smart home integration for no monthly fee.Learn more: Abode Home Security review	Pros & ConsExcellent smart home integrationOffers backup batteriesAffordable starter packagesHigher rates for month-by-month subscriptionsDoesn’t include control panelLimited customer service hours	Customer SurveyForbes Home’s survey of 1,900 home security users found Abode customers had overall very positive experiences: 86% were satisfied with the reliability of their system and 88% would recommend the company to a friend.

Founded in 1874 as American District Telephone, ADT has grown and evolved to meet modern customers’ needs with home security. From excellent video surveillance to smart home integrations, ADT scores highly both with customers and across our metrics. Although there are some options for installing and monitoring ADT security systems on your own, ADT is best known for its professional services. Highly experienced monitoring center employees are adept at responding to any and all emergencies with around-the-clock coverage.ADT charges more of a premium for its components and services. Customers should also be sure the company is a good fit for them before signing up: There is a 36-month contract commitment for some professionally installed systems. Those plans start at $34.99 per month.Learn more: ADT Home Security review	Pros & ConsExtended warrantiesExcellent professional servicesA+ BBB ratingPlans start at $24.99 per monthSome plans require 36-month contractsEarly cancellation fees	Customer SurveyAccording to Forbes Home’s survey of 1,900 home security customers, 86% of ADT customers would recommend the company to a friend.

But for customers in the company’s service areas, it is worth considering for those interested in professional installation and monitoring. Packages are straightforward and comprehensive, with excellent equipment options, including smart security cameras with advanced video analytics.Guardian does offer self-monitoring, but the company’s bread and butter is professional monitoring, and that costs a minimum of $49.99 per month. Because most systems are professionally installed, Guardian typically asks for a bigger commitment and only offers a three-day trial period.

Arlo is one of the younger companies we reviewed. It impressed us and its customer base with high-tech components, like the All-in-One Sensor that detects eight potential issues with just one part. Equally impressive are Arlo’s 4K surveillance cameras and long-lasting batteries. These come in at higher price points than comparable pieces from other companies, although those don’t have all the bells and whistles.Arlo offers self-monitoring starting at $9.99 per month per camera. Professional monitoring is also on the more expensive side, starting at $29.99 per month. Note that you may be able to save a bit on these prices if you choose to be billed annually for monitoring.Learn more: Arlo Home Security review	Pros & ConsAI-assisted monitoringHigh-tech cameras and sensorsGood smart home integrationFees for self-monitoringLimited customer supportThird-party installation only	Customer SurveyAccording to Forbes Home’s survey of 1,900 home security customers, 80% of Arlo customers would recommend the company to a friend.

Founded in 2007, Frontpoint has excellent consumer reviews, including an A+ rating with the BBB as of this writing. The company has earned loyal customers and a strong reputation in large part because of its excellent professional monitoring services and three-year product warranty coverage.Frontpoint offers equipment that is easy to self-install and is highly compatible with smart home systems. Unlike many other systems, Frontpoint uses cellular data, which means customers are still secure even if there is a Wi-Fi outage. While Frontpoint’s systems are designed for DIY install, the company requires that customers pay for monitoring services and the lowest-priced plan is roughly $15 per month just for self-monitoring and you’ll need to call to opt for anything but the highest monitoring plan.Learn more: Frontpoint review	Pros & ConsExcellent customer reviewsGreat smart home compatibility3-year product warrantyRequires fees for self-monitoringUses third-party productsSome features require a phone call	Customer SurveyFrontpoint customers included in Forbes Home’s survey of 1,900 home security customers reported high levels of satisfaction—with 84% saying they would recommend the company to a family member or friend.

What to Look for in a Home Security System
System Components
Although it varies from company to company, most basic packages include a home security hub and a combination of sensors and cameras. But that doesn’t necessarily mean these are the best features for you. In fact, our survey of 1,900 home security customers found that 81% were most interested in video surveillance, which isn’t always a feature of basic systems. Following that, 66% of customers said they prioritized 24/7 monitoring and 61% wanted motion sensors.
Different systems will offer different components, with some focusing on whole-home protection and others centering on one part of the home. We recommend shopping around.
Installation Options
The vast majority of customers had their systems professionally installed, while only 19% said the option of DIY installation was a selling point for them. While considering choices, this one question can make or break whether a home security system is the right fit for you. Although many companies offer both DIY or professional installation, some only install systems and others only offer self-installation.
Cost and Fine Print
Cost is another big factor—and it’s not just the upfront fees for equipment, installation and activation. According to the Forbes Home Survey, most customers reported spending between $21 and $60 per month for monitoring. It’s also important to read the fine print about any contracts, potential early termination fees or additional costs, such as for cloud backup.
Depending on your needs, other factors that could weigh into your decision include reports of false alarms, smart home integrations, app reviews and more.

Yes
Yes, home security cameras that are connected to the internet can be hacked. To increase security, set a strong, unique, and complicated password for your security account, enable two or multi-factor authentication, and use antivirus software on the devices that you use to monitor your cameras.

Security Expert and Writer, Advisory Board Member
Absolutely
Yes, internet-connected security cameras can be hacked. However, there are some steps that can increase your protection from hacks, including updating your security firmware regularly. You should keep an eye out for unrecognized logins, irregular camera movements and unusual voices on your systems, as these are all signs of a hack.

How Much Does a Home Security System Cost?
Most home security systems have two types of costs that should be equally considered: The upfront costs and the ongoing costs. Upfront costs include equipment rates as well as installation and activation fees. According to our research, the average cost to install a home security system is $600, including the system itself. On the basic side, DIY systems can cost about $200. Professionally installed, full-home systems can cost more than $1,200.
Among the companies we reviewed, professional installation fees ranged from $0 for all-inclusive packages (generally with contracts) to $225. Activation fees ranged from $0 to $99. Beyond installation and activation fees, some customers are subject to permit fees, but these depend on your local regulations. Permit requirements cover the costs of possible false alarms that may use public resources, and we found permits can cost between $40 and $550.
Then there is the matter of monitoring and storage fees. Self-monitoring is the most budget-friendly method, but some companies charge monthly rates for video storage and app access. Professional monitoring services grant more peace of mind, but at a monthly average of $20 to $60.

Home Security Buying and Installation Process: What To Expect
Home security systems are not one-size-fits-all and neither are the questions you should ask yourself before making a purchase. With variables including the types of equipment to how everything is installed, it’s important to understand what the full process looks like before diving in.
Equipment Types
Every home is different and so too are the home security needs. Most companies offer bundles or packages, but also allow for customization with a variety of additional components. Popular components include:
Base station or control panel
Indoor security camera
Outdoor security camera
Video doorbell
Entry sensor
Motion detector
Glass break sensor
Smoke detector
CO detector
Floodlight
Panic button
Some companies offer consultations and recommendations for what components could be best for the design of your property.
Installation Methods
When you’re in the market for a home security system, you can choose your own adventure so to speak, when it comes to how you want the system installed: by you or by a professional. It’s important to consider your preference upfront, as some companies only offer one or the other. Ultimately, 77% of home security customers surveyed by Forbes Home said they had their systems professionally installed.
Monitoring Options
Another choice to consider before committing to any home security service is whether you plan to self-monitor or want professional monitoring. With self-monitoring, customers generally get alerts on their app when something is detected, such as someone ringing the doorbell, motion on a camera or so on. It’s then up to the customer to examine the alert and make any necessary emergency calls. Some self-monitoring plans are free, while others charge low fees for video storage or app access.
With professional monitoring, the alert also goes to a 24/7 monitoring center where any potential threat is analyzed and appropriate calls are made on your behalf. The cost of this is higher—$20 to $60 per month on average—but it’s worthwhile peace of mind for many people.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
Are home security systems really worth it?
When we designed questions for our national survey of 1,900 home security customers, we wanted to be able to answer this question. According to respondents, the answer was a resounding yes—they did experience great value for the money they spent on their home security systems.
What’s the difference between DIY and professionally installed systems?
With DIY systems, customers receive the components and instructions, but then need a certain amount of technical know-how to get everything properly installed and activated. Some companies design their products to make DIY installations as simple as possible and many customers reported it wasn’t a challenge, but experiences will vary. On the other hand, customers don’t have to do any of the setup with professionally installed systems. Depending on the company, there may be an in-house or third-party installer, but either should be skilled and knowledgeable with the installation process.
