Easy Auto Ship stands out as the best car shipping company overall, scoring 4.8 out of 5 for its various affordable shipping options. Founded in 2013, the company has expanded to cover all 50 states and ships internationally. While it serves as a broker instead of a carrier, Easy Auto Ship fully vets its partners before allowing them to ship vehicles.Learn more: Easy Auto Ship review	Why We Picked ItWe picked Easy Auto Ship due partly to its customer-first approach to many of its offerings, like its 30-day pricing guarantee, GPS tracking and free car wash upon delivery.Why We Like ItBesides the perks above, we appreciate that Easy Auto Ship claims to have no hidden fees and provides an extra $100,000 in contingent auto insurance. A $150 cash discount is another bonus worth mentioning. Additionally, it offers free cancellation, price matching and a service guarantee.What We Don’t LikeEasy Auto Ship requires a $250 deposit, which isn’t ideal. However, it does offer a pretty generous cancellation policy. We’d also like additional features like a 24/7 customer service line and a mobile app.Who It’s Best ForEasy Auto Ship can be a good option for many customers. It offers both long- and short-distance moving, and open and enclosed shipping. While prices tend to skew a little higher, the value is still there.	Consumer Sentiment Index and Customer Survey

Easy Auto Ship experiences tend to be mixed. While some users report satisfying results with prompt service, professional staff and decent prices, others say they have issues with poor communication, unresolved damage claims and a lack of support post-payment.Easy Auto Ship customers had fairly middling reviews for the company in our survey of 1,600 car shipping customers. For instance, 35% said they were 10 out of 10 satisfied with the condition of their vehicle upon delivery, which was fairly average. Additionally, 83% of customers said the company delivered their vehicle on time, which was one of the lowest rates among all companies. That said, 60% of customers said they received a shipping date immediately, one of the highest rates on our list.
Pros & ConsFree car washFree cancellation30-day pricing guarantee$250 deposit requiredNo 24/7 customer service line	PricingTo help us get a better idea of pricing, we obtained several quotes covering various cost variables, such as the type of vehicle, the total distance and whether the shipment was open or enclosed. Remember, these are just estimates for a handful of specific scenarios, so it’s important to contact the company to get prices that reflect your situation.

You can also save money by booking your move on a Sunday, something unique to this company. However, it’s worth noting that cash is required to get any of these discounts. Besides discounts, it has 24/7 customer support, something not all shippers offer.What We Don’t LikeSGT Auto Transport has a $149 cancellation fee and lacks some helpful features like GPS tracking and terminal-to-terminal shipment, which may be necessary for some consumers.Who It’s Best ForWe recommend SGT Auto Transport for those planning a shorter-distance, door-to-door vehicle transport as the company had the lowest quote for a move of less than 500 miles out of any of the competitors on this list.

How Much Does Car Shipping Cost?
Car shipping can be quite expensive. In fact, according to a recent Forbes Home survey, nearly 30% of people chose to drive their car instead of shipping it specifically to save money. That being said, the cost of a car moving service will depend on several factors, including the method of transportation, the type of delivery, the distance of the journey and more.
The national average cost to ship a car is $1,150, but based on our research, we’ve found that prices can range from as low as $550 to as high as $2,450. That breaks down to 60 cents to $1.70 per mile. Note that per-mile costs may decrease as you get into a longer trip. If you’re looking for budget options, comparing multiple cheap auto transport companies can help you find competitive rates. For long-distance shipments, particularly coast-to-coast moves, you’ll need to find country car shipping companies that specialize in more complex routes. Because of these and other factors, we recommend reaching out to several companies for customized estimates.

What Factors Affect the Cost of Car Shipping?
Car shipping costs are very specific to the journey your car is making and what kind of car it is. The following factors will typically come into play and affect your car shipping costs.
Distance: Typically, the further your car travels, the more you’ll pay. International shipping will cost even more.
Vehicle size and weight: The bigger your vehicle, the fewer other vehicles will fit on the transporter. This can make your cost go up.
Timeframe: Some companies will allow you to ask for expedited delivery, which will cost you extra.
Transport type: Enclosed vehicle shipping is more protective of your vehicle than open transport, making it cost more. We’ll go over more specifics about this in just a moment.
Seasonal demand: Car shipping costs may go up between May and October, which is the peak season for moving.

Open Carrier vs. Enclosed Car Shipping
When deciding to ship your car, you’ll typically have a choice between open and enclosed car shipping. Open carrier car shipping typically involves transporting your car on a trailer that doesn’t have any walls with multiple other cars. If you’ve ever seen a truck towing many different cars on the highway, this is an example of open carrier shipping.
Enclosed car shipping typically means transporting your car in a trailer that is closed off from the elements, often by itself. It’s a common choice for classic cars or very high-value cars.

How To Ship a Car: 8 Steps to Ship a Car Across the Country
If you’ve never shipped a car before, you may be feeling a little overwhelmed. To help get you started, here’s a brief overview of how to ship a car from start to finish.
Research and choose a reputable car shipping company. Be sure to pay close attention to every company’s reviews and ensure that they meet national requirements, such as being registered with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA). Also, don’t be afraid to request quotes from multiple providers in order to negotiate the best price.
Pick a transport method. Typically, you can choose between open or enclosed shipping (i.e., containers that are exposed to the elements versus not). However, other methods are available in certain cases, like freight options for international travel.
Arrange pickup and delivery dates. As a general rule of thumb, the longer you are willing to wait for your car to be delivered, the cheaper the service will likely be. Expedited shipping is always going to be more expensive.
Choose a delivery method. Car shipping companies often offer two different delivery and pickup options: a door to door car shipping service (pick-up and delivery at your house) or terminal-to-terminal (pick-up and delivery at a storage facility). The first is more convenient, but the second is often cheaper. Some companies will also offer a combination of these (terminal-to-door, for example), so be sure to look into all of your options.
Prepare your car. Before your pickup date, be sure to clean your car, inspect it for existing damage and remove any personal items. Ask your chosen company for any other steps you’ll need to take to get your car ready.
Look over the Bill of Lading. This important document records your vehicle’s condition at pick-up and upon delivery. If damage occurs, it will be vital when submitting an insurance claim.
Track your car. Many car shipping companies offer GPS tracking so you can monitor your car’s progress throughout its journey. Others allow you to contact the driver or company with any questions about shipment progress. Tracking options like these are among the key features of top rated car shipping companies, giving customers added peace of mind during the transport process.
Receive your car. Once your car is delivered, carefully inspect it for any damage it may have incurred during travel. It’s also a good idea to check the mileage and ensure it’s the same as when you dropped the car off. If everything looks okay, sign off on the delivery. Then you’re done.

What to Look for When Choosing the Best Car Shipping Company for You
Years of Experience: While not the end-all-be-all when choosing a car shipping company, the number of years in the business often correlates with a company’s experience, resources and reputation. Many customers find that working with reliable car shipping companies that have been around for years often leads to a better experience.
Cost: The cost of car shipping will likely be one of your most important decision making factors. In addition to examining the total cost of the service, it’s important to consider deposits, cancellation policies, price guarantees and insurance options.
Broker vs. Carrier: Carriers are the ones on the ground actually shipping your car. Brokers coordinate car shipments and often have a network of multiple carriers. If you want your car shipping company to work directly with your vehicle, opt for a carrier. However, if you’d like to work with a larger national company with more options, you’ll likely need to go with a broker. Many vehicle transportation services are operated as brokers, with larger networks often giving customers access to a wider range of services, routes and availability.
Transport Type: Car shipping companies offer many different forms of transport, but the two most common are open and enclosed containers. Open is usually cheaper, but your vehicle will be exposed to the elements. Enclosed is more expensive but better protects the vehicle. For longer distances and international transport, some companies offer freight transport by air, rail or boat. If enclosed shipping is your priority, be sure to compare the best enclosed car transport companies to find one that meets your needs. Additionally, most companies will either offer door-to-door delivery or terminal-to-terminal delivery. If you have a strong preference, this can also help you narrow down your search.
Customer Support Options: Car shipping requires a lot of coordination, so having multiple methods of communication can be important depending on your preferences. For instance, if you don’t like talking on the phone, you may prefer a company with live chat and email support options. Additionally, GPS tracking is a great way to get updates on your vehicle without contacting the company directly. These are some of the features of the best automobile transport companies, ensuring a smooth, stress-free shipping experience.
Reputation and Customer Reviews: Reading customer reviews is a great way to get an overview of a company, both its positives and negatives. Be sure to check out a few different review sites when comparing reputable auto transport companies, and don’t be afraid to talk with your neighbors, friends or family to get suggestions.
Insurance Options: Insurance options will vary by provider and it’s critical to compare them. Car shipping companies are required by law to offer liability insurance, which protects your vehicle from damage and theft with limits. You can also opt for insurance through a third party to further protect your car, so we recommend looking into all limits, fees and details involved in any insurance policy offered by your car shipping company or broker.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
How do you know if a car shipping company is legit?
Check to make sure it has a U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) number or a motor carrier (MC) number. You can then look these numbers up in databases like the FMCSA’s SAFER database. Only legit car shipping companies will have proper licensing and credentials, so If the company doesn’t have a number, it probably isn’t legitimate.
How much time does car shipping usually take?
The length of time it takes to ship a car heavily depends on how far you’re the car is being transported and the company’s schedule. Moving a car a few states away can take just a few days, while shipping a car to another country can take weeks. We recommend getting a personalized estimate from the companies you research.
Is it cheaper to tow a car or ship it?
In some cases, towing can be cheaper, especially if you already own all the needed supplies. However, for most people, we still recommend shipping. Truck and trailer rentals can have many restrictions, and even the most experienced drivers can run into safety issues while hauling a large trailer or dolly.
Should I drive a car across the country or ship it?
While driving your car will almost always be cheaper, for long-distance moves, you may want to consider cross country car shipping companies. That way, you won’t put any additional miles on your car or add any wear to it. It’s also easier, more convenient and much safer to entrust your vehicle to professionals, especially when choosing from the best cross country car shipping companies
What is a Bill of Lading and Order for Service?
Consider a bill of lading like an inventory of everything you’re moving—so, in this case, your car. This document will generally include the name of the company and details about your specific car, like its make, model and current condition. You’ll be asked to sign the bill of lading at pick-up and delivery. As for the order of service, this is more like a contract and may include pricing information, the cancellation policy and other guarantees. Read over both documents carefully.
