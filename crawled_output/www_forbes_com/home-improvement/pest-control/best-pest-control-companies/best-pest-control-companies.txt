Our pick for the best overall pest control company is Orkin. With 120 years of experience and over 400 service locations, you can be assured that Orkin has the knowledge and resources to handle even the toughest pest control jobs. Additional services are also available through Orkin, including gutter guard and attic insulation installation designed to help keep pests away. The company’s service also includes home sealing to plug holes and minimize moisture.	Why We Picked ItOrkin’s extensive presence across 49 states, missing only Alaska, played a crucial role in our decision, accounting for 20% of its overall score. The company’s commitment to quality through a rigorous 160-hour technical training program and its versatile pest control offerings, ranging from single treatments to comprehensive annual plans, underline its industry standing. The inclusion of robust customer support channels, constituting 15% of its evaluation criteria, particularly return service options and a money-back guarantee underscores Orkin’s commitment to customer satisfaction. Why We Like ItOrkin’s standout feature is its comprehensive technician training, ensuring service delivery across a broad spectrum of pest issues. The flexibility to choose between one-time interventions and ongoing pest management caters to varying customer needs, enhancing its appeal. Also, the assurance of return services and a money-back guarantee underscores Orkin’s commitment to customer satisfaction.What We Don’t LikeOrkin’s limited availability of same-day and emergency services may not meet the needs of customers requiring immediate pest control interventions. The absence of complimentary inspections, a common offering among competitors, could deter potential customers, making this an area for potential improvement. Who It’s Best ForOrkin is ideally suited for individuals and businesses seeking a reliable pest control provider with a national footprint and a proven track record. The company’s rigorous technician training and comprehensive service options make it a compelling choice for those prioritizing quality and reliability in pest management solutions. However, customers in need of prompt services or those preferring a free initial inspection might find Orkin less accommodating to their immediate needs. Learn more:

We picked TERMINIX for having the best termite control program around. However, the company does far more than just eliminate termites. In addition to its termite control services, called Nix & Fix, which provides up to
$250,000
in damage protection if the company fails to control the problem, TERMINIX also offers control for over two dozen other pests.Also available through Terminix are home services designed to help keep pests out, such as gutter guard installation, attic insulation and crawl space sealing.	Why We Picked ItTERMINIX earns our recommendation for its exceptional termite control services, extending well beyond simple extermination. The company’s comprehensive approach, including its Nix & Fix program, which offers substantial damage protection up to
$250,000, showcases its commitment to resolving termite issues effectively.Why We Like ItWe are impressed by TERMINIX’s broad spectrum of pest control solutions, covering more than two dozen pests, and its additional home services like gutter guard installation and attic insulation, aimed at preventing pest entry. The company’s competitive pricing in the 45 states it operates further enhances its appeal to a wide range of customers.What We Don’t LikeDespite the positive aspects, TERMINIX’s reputation is tarnished by scattered reports of unsatisfactory customer service and billing issues in certain locations, detracting from its overall customer experience.Who It’s Best ForTERMINIX is ideal for homeowners seeking a robust termite control solution backed by significant financial protection. Its wide array of pest control and preventative home services also makes it a suitable option for those looking to safeguard their homes against various pests. However, potential customers might want to consider the localized customer service and billing concerns before making their decision.Learn more: TERMINIX Pest Control review	Consumer Sentiment Index

Terminix customer reviews frequently express dissatisfaction with unprofessional customer service, billing problems and ineffective pest control services. Many users feel misled by the company’s practices and report a lack of communication and accountability in addressing their concerns.

$550 to $700 annually
for the company’s common household pest protection. Additional services start around
$80 per month.As a pest control professional, something I appreciate about TERMINIX is that they offer free termite inspection. Termite damage can be absolutely devastating for a home, and it’s critical for this kind of problem to be addressed ASAP, yet many people don’t want to spend money on an inspection if they aren’t sure if they have a termite problem or not. So, offering a free inspection is great. — Brett Bennett

How to Find the Best Pest Control Company
Many factors can be weighed in deciding which pest control company you should hire. Our list of the best pest control companies provides a great starting point, but be sure to consider the following as you do your own research:
Availability in Your Area
Make sure the company you choose can accommodate services in your location. If you live in a remote area or a city where the company of your choice does not operate, it may not be able to provide service to your home. Double-check to make sure you are within range of a company’s service area before moving forward.
Cost
Most pest control companies can provide a ballpark estimate of cost over the phone, but many will need to perform a home inspection before providing you with a more accurate quote. Some companies offer free inspections and quotes while others do not. Additionally, some companies offer payment plans whereas others only accept payment up-front.
Ultimately, the cost of service will vary based on the type of pest, the level of infestation and the treatment plan, but you can expect to pay around $250 to $600 for a one-time treatment and anywhere from $100 to $300 per treatment for infestations requiring multiple visits.
To reiterate the size and square footage, the area you live in, types of products used, and the location of infestation matters. Attic, roof, or crawl space treatments will be more expensive than just a typical interior or exterior treatment.
– Noelle Goins
Treatment Schedules
Common treatment options include individual one-time treatments and preventative or maintenance packages scheduled regularly throughout the year (e.g. monthly, quarterly, etc.). Before committing to a company, ensure it’s able to provide services on a schedule that works for you.
In certain parts of the country, quarterly plans are being phased out as the chemicals used may not last longer than 30 days. Pests are becoming resistant to chemicals so rotating treatment plans is essential for control. Also, with climate change comes increased pest pressure. Pests that used be “seasonal” are influenced by unpredictable weather and invasive species are disrupting the biological culture we live in.
– Noelle Goins
Guarantees
Many companies offer a guarantee, your money back if you’re not satisfied or retreatment for a free/reduced cost if pests return within a certain time frame. Each individual company offers different terms for guarantees, so make sure to take a look at what they’re promising before you make a decision.
Ask your pest control what products they intend to use and if the product is residual. Your invoice should always state the chemicals used so that you know what the pesticide label actually guarantees. The label is the law for licensed pest control companies to follow so to guarantee a treatment for 90-days when a label may only recommend 45 days is important to know so expectations can be managed.
– Noelle Goins
Customer Satisfaction and Reputation
We recommend you take a look at customer reviews for any companies you’re considering. Companies with overall positive reputations or excellent consumer feedback have a higher chance of providing you with great service, but look at reviews in the two to four-star range, as those at either extreme often lack substance in one direction or another. A well-established company might also have a rating and accreditation with the Better Business Bureau (BBB).
EXPERT TIPS
How many times a year should I get my house sprayed for bugs?

Pest Control Expert and Nonprofit Owner, Advisory Board Member
Lowe Saddler
Lead Editor
Cassidy Grubisic
Updates Editor
It Depends
This varies on where you live and the activity you have in your area. Colder climates may get by with quarterly service but increased pest pressure overall is moving companies to only offer monthly or bi-monthly services.
Noelle Goins
Pest Control Expert and Nonprofit Owner, Advisory Board Member
Monthly Treatments May Be Necessary
When determing how many times per year you should spray your home for bugs, first take into account what types of insects are plaguing your property and where you’re located. For non-aggressive pests in temperate climate zones, quarterly sprays should suffice. If however, you’re battling a more intense infestation, of insects like termites or bed bugs, monthly treatments may be ideal.
Lowe Saddler
Lead Editor
The Timeline Will Vary
The frequency can vary depending on many factors, including location, climate and weather. Typically, you can expect either quarterly, bi-monthly or monthly visits. Since each situation is unique, be sure to talk to a professional to get the most accurate idea.
Cassidy Grubisic
Updates Editor
Types of Pest Control
The treatment options that a pest control company offers may vary based on the most common types of pest in your state. Common treatment modalities include biological strategies, chemical applications, physical barriers or traps, bug bombs and electronic deterrents.
Pest control strategies should be tailored to the type of pest causing the acute infestation. Alternatively, plans can be designed to control a wide variety of pests and applied preventatively. One company may have more experience than another with the type of pest(s) you’re seeking to treat, so make sure to choose a company that has a proven track record with the issue at hand.

How Much Do Pest Control Companies Cost?
The cost of pest control will vary depending on the company you choose, the type of pest, the level of infestation and the frequency of treatment.
Single treatments in preparation for an event at your home generally cost between
$250 and $600. Pest specific control such as the cost of termite treatment typically ranges from $230 to $930 for most services, for roaches you’ll typically pay around $250 for the cost of a cockroach exterminator. This depends on the level of infestation and can reach up to $7,000 for house tenting and fumigation.
The cost of pest control ranges depending on the type of infestation, species of pest, square footage of your home, the area you live in (California may be more expensive for pest control then say, Nevada). Companies using premium products that you must be licensed to purchase will charge more than companies that do not. Also, companies that only use green products will charge more because green products cost more.
– Noelle Goins
However, many homeowners opt for ongoing services that may or may not include a long-term pest control contract with their provider. These ongoing services generally cost between
$75 and $120
for monthly treatments or
$100 to $300
for quarterly visits, and can start after a thorough initial extermination that’ll cost between
$150 and $300
depending on the infestation severity and eradication methods.
It is important to know what ongoing services include. A lower monthly cost may only be for exterior service and not interior. Also, knowing what pests are included in ongoing services [is important] so that you know what a company considers “specialty pests.”
– Noelle Goins
Are Pest Control Companies Worth It?
A recent survey Forbes Home conducted found that nearly half of those surveyed said their home has experienced structural damage due to a pest infestation. If you have found yourself in this situation, or want to prevent it, it may be worth it to hire a pest control company for large infestations or persistent pest issues, especially if you have been unsuccessful in eliminating them on your own.
Many pest control companies can give you a tailored plan for treatment after a thorough inspection of your home. Reputable companies have the knowledge and experience to support a treatment plan and may have access to more powerful products than you can acquire over the counter.
“More powerful” in our world means, I have a license to buy something that you do not have access to purchase without a license. Our license also gives the expertise, certification and pest identification to know when to use which product on said pest. For instance, many over the counter products are repellants, which cause bugs to repel. We know when to use products that have an insect growth regulator or birth control, and also when to use products that pests cannot detect so that they will walk through it and die rather than avoid it.
– Noelle Goins
Here are several pros and cons to weigh before deciding on a professional pest treatment versus a DIY solution.
Pros
Effectiveness:
Professional pest control services and products are more likely to be effective for large or persistent infestations. Consider the scale of your pest issue when deciding between a professional or DIY approach.
Guarantees:
DIY products may or may not come with a satisfaction or effectiveness guarantee. Even when they do, sometimes the store from which the product was purchased can choose not to honor a return or exchange based on its own policies. Most reputable pest control companies offer some type of satisfaction guarantee. It is common for companies to promise an additional treatment for free or a refund on services rendered if the initial service is not effective or the pests recur within a specified time period.
Safety:
Both DIY and professional pest control methods can involve harsh and even dangerous chemicals. These chemicals have the potential to harm not only the pests, but also any people or animals living in the home if not applied properly and in the right quantities. Professional pest control companies have the knowledge, the experience, and the license to use these chemicals as safely as possible and avoid harming any members of the household they are treating. If you have a small infestation and would prefer to only use all-natural products in your home, a DIY solution made of non-toxic, common household items may be best for you.
Cons
Cost:
The up-front cost of professional pest control products and services is undeniably higher than most DIY solutions, and according to the same Forbes Home survey, nearly half of the respondents (45%) said they would be, or have been, willing to pay up to
$200
to prevent pests. That being said, you may still wish to hire a company to resolve your pest problem if the infestation is large or persistent. Wasting money on ineffective DIY solutions can be both frustrating and costly.
Scheduling:
DIY projects can be undertaken conveniently on your own time and schedule. Coordinating services through a professional company may be more difficult if you have a busy calendar

Questions to Ask a Pest Control Company Before You Hire Them
We recommend that you ask a pest control company the following questions to better inform your decision:
What kind of pests do you treat?
Do you provide services at my address?
Do you provide free inspection and quotes?
What products do you use and are they safe for humans and pets? Will they affect my health, kids and/or pets?
What treatment schedules do you offer?
Do you offer a guarantee or refund policy?
