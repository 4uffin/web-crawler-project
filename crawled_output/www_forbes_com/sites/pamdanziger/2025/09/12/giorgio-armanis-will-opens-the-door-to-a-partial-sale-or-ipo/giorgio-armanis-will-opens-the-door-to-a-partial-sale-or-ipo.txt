In 2016, he codified that legacy by establishing the Giorgio Armani Foundation to “safeguard the governance assets of the Armani Group and ensure that these assets are kept stable over time.” At the time, the foundation owned less than a 1% share of the company, but now, after his passing, it receives 30% of shares and voting rights. Dell’Orco is currently chairman of the foundation. Cruicial Quote“The will specifies that all short- and medium-term strategic decisions will rest with Mr. Dell’Orco and the family, supported by the foundation; however, these decisions were guided by Mr. Armani himself, both in terms of the brand’s mission and in possible actions with implications for the group’s medium- and long-term structure,” the Giorgio Armani executive committee said in a statement. “In this light, the will makes reference to a stock market listing as well as the opening to a minority partner of recognized standing and genuine interest in the brand. The responsibility for decisions and management of this process will remain with Mr. Dell’Orco and the family, under the guidance of the foundation, but always within the principles and rules defined by Mr. Armani.” Potential SuitorsLVMH chairman Bernard Arnault has long been rumored to be interested in acquiring the Armani brand, but nothing concrete has ever materialized. LVMH’s fashion and leather goods holdings totaled $48 billion in 2024, compared with Armani Group sales of $2.7 billion last year. LVMH maintains decentralized control of the 70 luxury brands in its portfolio, so it would be a fitting acquirer to maintain the brand’s artistic independence. In addition, analyst Mario Ortelli observed Armani has “great white space” in the accessories category where LVMH
could help the brand gain traction. Beauty industry leader L’Oréal is a longtime Armani partner; however, it has no experience or holdings in the fashion market. L’Oréal brags: “One focus: beauty, nothing but beauty and all beauty.” Eyewear powerhouse EssilorLuxottica is also a longtime brand partner, but unlike L’Oréal, it has made forays into fashion. It acquired the streetwear Supreme fashion brand from VF Corporation for $1.5 billion last year and also owns outdoor athletic brands Oakley and Costa. What To Watch ForWhether Armani’s heirs pursue a sale or an IPO, a suitable CEO will be needed to keep the company moving forward. As of yet, no CEO has been named. However, two likely candidates are longtime employees Giuseppe Marsocci and Daniele Ballestrazzi, both of whom were promoted to deputy general managers earlier this year. Marsocci is responsible for sales and marketing and Ballestrazzi oversees finance and operations.
