Alison is a senior news reporter covering US politics and legal news.Follow AuthorSep 15, 2025, 08:57am EDTShareSaveCommentToplinePresident Donald Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested Monday his administration has reached a deal with China about TikTok that could keep it online, as the app faced its latest threat of going dark this week with Trump’s latest pause of a ban on the app.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent speaks to reporters following trade talks with China in Madrid on September 15.AFP via Getty ImagesKey FactsTrump said on Truth Social on Monday morning his administration’s trade discussions with China had gone “VERY WELL,” alleging “a deal was also reached on a ‘certain’ company that young people in our Country very much wanted to save” and saying those young people “will be very happy!”Bessent and other Trump officials met with Chinese officials Monday to discuss economic policy, tariffs and the TikTok deal, with Bessent telling reporters after the meeting that the two sides had reached a “framework” for a deal on TikTok.It’s still unclear what the deal will look like or how it could affect the app, including whether a potential buyer for TikTok has been found.Bessent told reporters the framework requires TikTok to switch to “U.S.-controlled ownership,” but it’s still unclear who that owner could be.Congress passed a law requiring TikTok to be banned if ByteDance didn’t divest itself from the app, citing national security concerns, but despite a ruling from the Supreme Court upholding the law, the popular app has so far remained online, as the Trump administration has repeatedly pushed back the deadline for the ban taking effect.The latest extension had been set to expire Wednesday, and it had been unclear if the app could go offline: Reuters reported the Trump administration was willing to cut off the app if negotiations didn’t go well, and Trump told reporters Sunday his administration “may let it die,” claiming the issue “doesn’t matter too much.”Crucial QuoteThe Trump administration wanted to ensure it made a deal on TikTok “that is fair for the Chinese, and completely respects national security concerns,” Trade Representative Jamieson Greer told reporters Monday. “And that’s the deal we reached.”This story is breaking and will be updated.Got a tip?
