Alison is a senior news reporter covering US politics and legal news.Follow AuthorSep 18, 2025, 12:06pm EDTShareSaveCommentAdd Us On GoogleToplinePresident Donald Trump asked the Supreme Court on Thursday to let him fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, calling on justices to pause a lower court ruling that blocked the termination, as the president continues his efforts to fire Cook despite reports showing she did not have the improper mortgage applications the Trump administration claimed.Federal Reserve Board of Governors member Lisa Cook at an open meeting of the Board of Governors at the Federal Reserve on June 25, 2025, in Washington.Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.Key FactsTrump asked the Supreme Court to pause an appeals court ruling that found he did not have the authority to fire Cook, after the president said he was firing the Fed governor over alleged issues with her mortgage filings.Federal law only allows Trump to fire members of the Federal Reserve’s board “for cause,” which typically refers to some kind of gross misconduct, and two federal courts have now ruled that Cook could only be fired for some kind of issue with her job performance at the Fed, and not for any personal issues with her mortgage.Trump claims he did fire Cook “for cause,” however, pointing to the board member’s role overseeing monetary policy and arguing to the Supreme Court that “strong concerns about the appearance of mortgage fraud … satisfies any conception of cause.”Cook has strongly denied any wrongdoing, and recent reports indicate she did not claim two properties as primary residences as the Trump administration had claimed, with Reuters reporting Cook correctly labeled her home in Atlanta as being a “vacation home” on a loan application, and officials in Michigan confirming there was no impropriety regarding her other residence in Detroit.The case has the potential to broadly clear the way for Trump to gain widespread influence over government boards that have historically been independent, as it gives the Supreme Court an opportunity to fully overturn a 90-year old precedent that largely shields independent agencies from political influence.What To Watch ForIt’s still unclear how the Supreme Court will rule on the Cook dispute, and when a ruling could come out. Trump has so far only asked the court to issue a temporary ruling that would allow him to fire Cook while the litigation keeps playing out in the lower courts, so that means any ruling the court makes now on Cook’s job could still be changed in the future.This story is breaking and will be updated.Got a tip?
