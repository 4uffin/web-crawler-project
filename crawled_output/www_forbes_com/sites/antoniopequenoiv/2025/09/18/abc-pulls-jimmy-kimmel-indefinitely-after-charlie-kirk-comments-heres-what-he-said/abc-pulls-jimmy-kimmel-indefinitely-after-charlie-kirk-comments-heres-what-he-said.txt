Kimmel speaks at the 2022 Media Access Awards presented by Easterseals and broadcast on November 17, 2022. (Photo by 2022 Media Access Awards Presented By Easterseals/Getty Images for Easterseals)Getty Images for EastersealsKey FactsThe Disney-owned broadcaster announced Wednesday evening that Kimmel’s show would be paused ‘indefinitely’ from airing on ABC, which confirmed the news in an email to Forbes.Shortly before the announcement, the media company Nexstar, which owns many local ABC affiliates, announced it would pull the show starting Wednesday evening. Andrew Alford, President of Nexstar’s broadcasting division, did not cite specific comments from Kimmel that informed the broadcaster’s decision to pull his show, but noted the comments were “offensive and insensitive at a critical time in our national political discourse, and we do not believe they reflect the spectrum of opinions, views, or values of the local communities in which we are located.”The show’s removal comes after FCC Chairman Brendan Carr criticized Kimmel in an appearance on right-wing commentator Benny Johnson’s podcast, suggesting the FCC could take action against the talk show and that broadcasters “have a license granted by us at the FCC, and that comes with it an obligation to operate in the public interest.”Carr told multiple outlets Wednesday “While this may be an unprecedented decision, it is important for broadcasters to push back on Disney programming that they determine falls short of community.”Sinclair Broadcast Group, ABC’s largest affiliate, will also stop airing Kimmel’s show “until further notice” and broadcast a one-hour special in remembrance of Kirk during Friday’s “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” time slot.Get Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We’re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day’s headlines.

Kimmel also jabbed at Trump for a clip in which the president was asked how he was holding up the day after Kirk’s assassination, to which Trump said, “I think very good” before changing the subject to construction on the White House’s new ballroom. “He’s at the fourth stage of grief, construction,” Kimmel said. “This is not how an adult grieves the murder of someone he called a friend. This is how a four-year-old mourns a goldfish.” The talk show host also blasted FBI Director Kash Patel for handling the investigation into Kirk’s death “like a kid who didn’t read the book, BSing his way through an oral report.”How Has Trump Reacted To The Kimmel Being Taken Off Air?The president cheered, Kimmel being taken off air in a post on Truth Social, saying: “The ratings challenged Jimmy Kimmel Show is CANCELLED. Congratulations to ABC for finally having the courage to do what had to be done. Kimmel has ZERO talent, and worse ratings than even Colbert, if that’s possible.” The White House’s Rapid Response X account tweeted: “They're doing their viewers a favor. Jimmy is a sick freak!”Chief CriticsABC’s decision to take Kimmel’s show off air has come under sharp criticism from Democratic Party leaders and other entertainers. In a post on X, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y wrote: “America is meant to be a bastion of free speech. Everybody across the political spectrum should be speaking out to stop what’s happening to Jimmy Kimmel. This is about protecting democracy. This must go to court.” California Gov. Gavin Newsom, tweeted: “Buying and controlling media platforms. Firing commentators. Canceling shows. These aren’t coincidences. It’s coordinated. And it’s dangerous. The GOP does not believe in free speech. They are censoring you in real time.” Actor Ben Stiller tweeted: “This isn’t right.” The Writers Guild of America also criticized the network for the decision, saying: “As a Guild, we stand united in opposition to anyone who uses their power and influence to silence the voices of writers, or anyone who speaks in dissent.” TangentNexstar is seeking FCC approval for its $6.2 billion acquisition of TEGNA, which would give Nexstar the largest share of local TV stations in the U.S. In order for the deal to go through, the FCC would need to raise its 40% broadcast ownership cap, according to The Hollywood Reporter. The FCC has been influential over the media throughout the first year of Trump’s presidency. CBS News settled a lawsuit brought by President Donald Trump as its parent company, Paramount, sought approval for a merger with Skydance Media. The FCC eventually greenlit the $8 billion merger after the $16 billion settlement from CBS and promises from Skydance to eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion considerations and examine allegations of bias. Carr lauded the commitments from Skydance, saying, “Americans no longer trust the legacy national news media to report fully, accurately, and fairly.” Paramount Skydance has also reportedly prepared a bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, which owns CNN, while CEO David Ellison’s father, Oracle founder Larry Ellison, is reportedly in talks to take a stake in TikTok. Key BackgroundKimmel has long been a critic of Trump. While the host did not endorse a particular candidate in the 2024 presidential election. On election day, Kimmel said “it was a terrible night for everyone who voted against him. And guess what? It was a bad night for everyone who voted for him too. You just don’t realize it yet.” Kimmel’s indefinite ABC removal comes months after CBS announced it was cancelling “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” purely for financial reasons. However, Democratic lawmakers like Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., questioned the timing of the cancellation, which came amid Colbert’s scrutiny against the president and after Paramount settled the $16 million lawsuit with Trump.Further ReadingStephen Colbert’s Cancellation Monologue Nears 10 Million On YouTube—His Most-Watched Video In 6 Years (Forbes)Got a tip?
