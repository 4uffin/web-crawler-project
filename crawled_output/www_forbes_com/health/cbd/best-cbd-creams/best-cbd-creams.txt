Cannabidiol (CBD) may offer pain relieving benefits. Clinical studies note that topical products containing CBD, such as creams, balms and gels, can assist with alleviating pain related to conditions like arthritis, migraines, nerve damage and muscle aches. Choosing a CBD cream among the countless available options may feel overwhelming, however. To assist in your search, we did the investigative legwork for you.
To choose the best CBD creams, the Forbes Health editorial team analyzed data on more than 50 CBD cream products made from plants grown in the U.S. All have a certificate of analysis (COA), are third-party tested by ISO 17025-compliant laboratories and contain no more than 0.3% tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) by dry weight. From price to potency to special effects, learn which CBD cream products stand out as our top picks.
Note: Prices listed are accurate as of the publication date.

While the cream is free of dyes, perfumes and fragrances, Redeem reports a mild, minty smell because of the organic menthol extract, which may not be ideal for customers wanting to avoid scents altogether.”

“I find Lazarus Naturals CBD Skin Repair Cream appealing because of its packaging. I prefer a tube design over a jar for travel and hygiene reasons. I also appreciate that this product is mindful of individuals with dry or damaged skin. However, as someone with sensitive skin, I’m concerned with the potential irritants included in this product’s extensive ingredient list like witch hazel and sweet almond oil.”

Methodology: How We Picked the Best CBD Creams of 2025
To choose the best CBD creams, the Forbes Health editorial team analyzed data on almost 100 CBD creams products that are:
Made from plants grown in the U.S.
Have a certificate of analysis (COA)
Are third-party tested by ISO 17025-compliant laboratories
Are made with all natural ingredients
We then ranked CBD creams based on:
Price (30%)
Potency (30%)
Whether the product features all-natural ingredients (15%)
Whether all ingredients are organic (10%)
Whether all ingredients are non-GMO (7.5%)
Whether the product features additional soothing properties (7.5%)
We consider a standard application size to be .05 ounces of CBD cream but provide full product pricing in addition to a per-application breakdown to help you determine the best daily value, as well as what works for your budget as a whole.
What Is CBD Cream?
CBD cream, which often includes balms and salves, is a topical application of cannabidiol. This cream offers more localized effects rather than systemic ones that edibles or inhalation can provide.
“When CBD is used topically, it does not reach the bloodstream,” says Robert Milanes M.D., founder of Holistic On Call and a doctor with Heally, an alternative medicine telehealth platform.
This application method makes CBD cream a good choice for people who are new to CBD and less comfortable ingesting it, but still want to benefit from CBD’s pain relief abilities.
“Because it’s localized, it’s not the best method of delivery for trying to help yourself sleep or for anxiety,” says Steven Phan, founder of Come Back Daily, a CBD dispensary in New York.
How CBD Cream Works
Compared to ingesting CBD, which can take anywhere from 30 minutes to two hours to take effect, applying CBD topically allows you to feel the localized effects pretty quickly, according to Laura Fuentes, a licensed compound pharmacist and co-founder of Green Roads, a major CBD brand.
This quick uptake, paired with CBD’s inherent benefits, makes CBD cream a great option for pain, inflammation, soreness and tightness relief in specific parts of your body, she says.
Potential CBD Cream Health Benefits
Research suggests the cannabinoids in topical CBD creams may be absorbed more efficiently by the body through the skin, rather than passing through digestion, as is the case with orally ingested CBD products.
Although research in the U.S. is ongoing, preliminary studies show that topical CBD cream may be beneficial when it comes to treating chronic pain conditions, such as arthritis. However, additional well-designed human clinical trials are needed, as much of the existing research is based on animal studies or anecdotal results.
One small, placebo-controlled 2020 study in Current Pharmaceutical Biotechnology examined the use of topical CBD in 29 participants with peripheral neuropathy, a chronic pain condition caused by nerve damage. The results showed that the 15 participants using topical CBD oil experienced significantly less pain compared to the 14 participants using the placebo after four weeks[1]Xu DH, Cullen BD, Tang M, Fang Y. The Effectiveness of Topical Cannabidiol Oil in Symptomatic Relief of Peripheral Neuropathy of the Lower Extremities. Curr Pharm Biotechnol. 2020;21(5):390-402. .
Another 2018 study with over 300 participants with knee pain from osteoarthritis found a transdermal synthetic CBD gel significantly improved patients’ worst pain score and physical function averages. These patients were treated with 350 milligrams of CBD gel per day for 12 weeks[2]Hunter D, Oldfield G, Tich N, Messenheimer J, Sebree T. Synthetic transdermal cannabidiol for the treatment of knee pain due to osteoarthritis . Osteoarthritis and Cartilage. 2018;26:S26. .
Additionally, some research suggests that the anti-inflammatory properties of CBD cream may help to improve certain skin conditions such as acne and eczema.

CBD Creams and Topicals Side Effects
CBD itself is safe and well tolerated, and it has no risks of abuse or dependence, according to the World Health Organization.
“Additionally, using CBD topically reduces the likelihood of experiencing side effects typically associated with CBD use, such as drowsiness, fatigue and diarrhea,” says Dr. Milanes.
Milanes and Fuentes warn that while CBD itself might be safe, there is a chance you might be allergic or sensitive to another ingredient in a CBD topical, which could cause adverse effects. To avoid unpleasant reactions, they suggest reading ingredient lists carefully.
Phan also recommends talking to your doctor before using CBD if you’re on any medications— especially blood pressure medications because CBD can also lower blood pressure.
Is CBD Cream Safe?
Because CBD creams aren’t regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as topical drug products, it’s difficult to determine their safety and efficacy as a product category. However, the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) reports that topical CBD products may be effective in treating conditions including acne, psoriasis and eczema with few or no side effects. Ultimately, safety and efficacy depend on the specific CBD cream product and its formulation.
How Do You Apply CBD Cream?
To apply a CBD cream, you rub it into the affected area, such as an achy knee or sore neck. “The cream is absorbed into the skin and then binds to the numerous cannabinoid receptors located in the different layers of the skin,” says Fuentes.
Each topical CBD product may have unique directions, however. Some may instruct you to use a small amount while others encourage using a liberal amount.
Balms and salves have a thicker consistency and often need to be warmed in your hands before applying them to the target area. And some products don’t require getting your hands dirty at all, thanks to roll-on and stick applicators.
CBD Cream Popularity
CBD creams are a popular way to use CBD in the U.S., according to a recent Forbes Health survey of 2,000 U.S. adults conducted by OnePoll. In fact, 53% of respondents who reported having tried CBD used it in lotion form, and 42% used it in a serum or other topical form.
CBD use in general is increasingly common—60% of U.S. adults have tried a CBD product before. Better yet, 60% believe it has medicinal benefits. The same survey reports that the majority of people use CBD in a variety of forms to help relieve pain.
Does CBD Cream Work for Pain?
According to the Forbes Health survey, 60% of U.S. participants used CBD products for pain relief. And while more research is needed, preliminary studies show promising results when it comes to using CBD creams and other CBD topicals for acute and chronic pain relief.
In an additional anecdotal case study of two patients with back pain using the same CBD cream containing 400 milligrams of CBD per 2 ounces, both participants experienced significant pain relief, highlighting the need for further research into topical CBD cream as a pain management tool[3]Eskander JP, Spall J, Spall A, et al. Cannabidiol (CBD) as a treatment of acute and chronic back pain: A case series and literature review. J Opioid Manag. 2020;16(3):215-218. .
How Much Does CBD Cream Cost?
Several factors can impact the cost of a CBD cream, including the potency per application (or container) and its quality, such as whether it’s made from organic hemp.
Based on data compiled by Forbes Health, the price per .05-ounce application of selected creams ranged from $.24 to $3.20, with an average of $1.18 per application.
How Long Does CBD Cream Last?
Individuals who use CBD cream may start to feel therapeutic effects within 10 to 15 minutes of application, and benefits may last anywhere from two to three hours to up to 24 hours. However, how long the benefits of CBD cream last may vary depending on how often an individual uses CBD topicals and the specific product’s formulation and potency.
Is CBD Cream Right for You?
CBD cream may help alleviate symptoms of eczema, psoriasis and acne and may reduce pain caused by inflammation. However, whether CBD cream is right for you depends on multiple factors, such as personal preference, health history and cost. Additionally, CBD may interact with other medications and supplements, including melatonin, warfarin and more. Speak with a health care provider to determine whether you could benefit from adding CBD cream to your wellness routine.
Where to Buy the Best CBD Creams, Balms and Lotions
CBD creams are widely available for purchase from brick-and-mortar wellness stores and CBD shops, as well as myriad manufacturers online.
Regardless of whether you’re purchasing CBD cream in person or online, it’s always best to look for a high-quality product that has a COA from a third-party laboratory showing its potency, its cannabinoid content and that it’s free of pesticides, heavy metals and other contaminants.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
What does CBD cream do to your body?
Preliminary research suggests that CBD creams act locally to reduce inflammation and pain, though more research is needed.
Will using CBD creams result in a positive drug test?
A CBD cream containing less than 0.3% THC by dry weight is unlikely to make you
fail a drug test
for THC. However, it’s important to obtain a COA for any CBD product you purchase to ensure it doesn’t contain higher levels of THC, as there is little research available regarding how CBD creams containing THC might affect different types of THC drug tests, including urine and hair analysis.
How long does it take for CBD pain cream to work?
The amount of time it takes for a CBD cream to work can vary based on the individual, as well as the contents of the specific CBD cream used. More research is needed to accurately determine the most effective way to deliver CBD topically for pain relief.
Is CBD cream legal?
Per the 2018 Farm Bill, CBD products, including CBD creams, derived from hemp containing no more than 0.3% THC by dry weight are considered federally legal. Specific rules and regulations may
vary from state to state, however, so it’s best to check with your state’s regulatory agency regarding the safe and legal use of CBD products where you live.
Does topical CBD cream get into your bloodstream?
No, CBD creams do not enter the bloodstream likely because the skin’s endocannabinoid receptors bind with the CBD molecules before they can pass through to the bloodstream. This binding action in the skin is what produces topical CBD’s potentially beneficial effects.
Does CBD lotion work for nerve pain?
While little existing research on human models examines the effects of CBD topicals on individuals with nerve pain, one small 2020 study of 29 individuals found transdermal CBD application may help alleviate pain related to nerve damage outside the brain and spinal cord[3]Eskander JP, Spall J, Spall A, et al.
