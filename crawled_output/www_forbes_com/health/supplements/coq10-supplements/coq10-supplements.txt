Commissions we earn from partner links on this page do not affect our opinions or evaluations. Our editorial content is based on thorough research and guidance from the Forbes Health Advisory Board.
Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), also known as ubiquinone, is a fat-soluble, vitamin-like molecule that functions as a powerhouse antioxidant, fueling the cells and boosting energy. In the heart, where the highest concentration of CoQ10 is found, it optimizes cardiac function. CoQ10 also acts as an immune enhancer, helping the immune system fight off free radicals that cause cellular damage.
Although it’s naturally produced in the body, the aging process and certain health conditions such as heart disease can deplete CoQ10 stores. For older people and those who have these conditions, supplementing can help replenish and maintain optimal levels to support overall health. Due to its antioxidant properties, CoQ10 may also protect against neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s by reducing oxidative stress and improving mitochondrial function. Some research even suggests that CoQ10 can reduce the oxidative stress in cells, which may improve exercise performance and recovery.
If you’re in search of a standout CoQ10 supplement, Forbes Health did the hard work for you. Below are the best CoQ10 supplements, based on recommendations from registered dietitians,  as well as cost per serving, third-party testing and potency.

Methodology: How We Picked the Best Coq10 Supplements
To determine the best CoQ10 supplements, the Forbes Health editorial team consulted experts on the Forbes Health Advisory Board for their top recommendations. Star ratings were assigned by the editorial team based on the following factors:
Price per serving (40%)
Third-party testing (30%)
CoQ10 potency (30%)
What Is CoQ10?
Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), or ubiquinone, is a vitamin-like nutrient naturally produced in the body and found in nearly all of its cells, says Michelle Routhenstein, a registered dietitian nutritionist at EntirelyNourished.com and a Forbes Health Advisory Board member. The liver, kidneys, pancreas and heart contain the highest amounts of CoQ10.
“It’s essential for cellular energy production and acts as an antioxidant—safeguarding cells, particularly those in the heart—from damage by free radicals (unstable molecules),” says Routhenstein. Because of its vital role in human health, researchers are studying the potential benefits of CoQ10 as a supplement.

Forms of CoQ10
CoQ10 exists in both ubiquinone and ubiquinol forms, says David M. Brady, N.D., a board-certified naturopathic practitioner based in Fairfield, Connecticut and chief medical officer at Designs for Health. CoQ10 as ubiquinone is converted to ubiquinol, the reduced form, notes Dr. Brady.“In its ubiquinol form, CoQ10 functions as a potent antioxidant, thus serving as a primary scavenger of free radicals and protecting cell membranes,” he explains.
The bodies of most healthy young individuals can convert ubiquinone to ubiquinol, says Dr. Brady. In fact, research demonstrates that 80% to 95% of circulating CoQ10 is in ubiquinol form[1]Barcelos IP, Haas RH. CoQ10 and Aging. Biology (Basel). 2019;8(2):28. . However, this conversion slows in aging individuals and those with conditions such as heart failure , diabetes, cancer and fibromyalgia; in these individuals, Dr. Brady recommends supplementing with CoQ10.
Benefits of CoQ10 Supplements
CoQ10 supplementation may benefit the following individuals, says Routhenstein:
People taking statins: “Taking a statin (a drug used to lower cholesterol or triglycerides) may deplete CoQ10 levels, potentially leading to muscle aches,” says Routhenstein. One recent meta-analysis concluded that supplementing with CoQ10 alongside statin therapy may help counteract muscle pain, cramps and weakness[2]Qu H, Guo M. Effects of Coenzyme Q10 on Statin‐Induced Myopathy: An Updated Meta‐Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials. Journal of the American Heart Association. 2018;7(19). .
Older adults: Because CoQ10 stores decrease with age, older adults are at increased risk of depletion and may benefit from supplementation, Routhenstein says.
Individuals with chronic health conditions: Because of its role in reducing inflammation, CoQ10 may benefit individuals with heart disease, kidney disease, diabetes and cancer.
Individuals with fertility issues: CoQ10 supplementation may benefit men and women with infertility. Research indicates that it improves egg health in women with ovulation issues and improves sperm quality and motility in men with male infertility, though further research is warranted[3]Nie X, Dong X, et al. Coenzyme Q10 Stimulate Reproductive Vitality. Drug Des Devel Ther. 2023 Aug 30;17:2623-2637. [4]Salvio G, Cutini M, et al. Coenzyme Q10 and Male Infertility: A Systematic Review. Antioxidants (Basel). 2021 May 30;10(6):874. .
Pros and Cons of Coq10 Supplements
There are pros and cons of taking CoQ10 supplements. “CoQ10 supplements offer potential benefits for heart health, acting as antioxidants, regulating blood pressure, potentially relieving migraines and enhancing exercise performance,” says Routhenstein.
On the other hand, possible drawbacks include limited absorption, cost, potential side effects (such as insomnia or digestive discomfort), interaction with medications and a lack of regulatory oversight. Unlike prescription medications, dietary supplements are not reviewed or tested by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) before they are sold.
Who Should Consider CoQ10 Supplements?
Certain individuals are at a higher risk of CoQ10 depletion and may benefit from supplementation. “For example, advanced age, cardiovascular disease, metabolic disorders, neurodegenerative disorders, mitochondrial disorders and the use of statin drugs are all associated with CoQ10 deficiencies or an increased need for CoQ10,” says Dr. Brady.
“Consulting a health care provider before starting supplementation is important to ensure it’s safe and suitable for your individual health needs,” advises Routhenstein.
Who May Not Benefit?
“Combining CoQ10 with anticoagulants like warfarin or Plavix is not advisable as it may reduce the effectiveness of the anticoagulant, potentially leading to an increased risk of blood clot formation,” explains Routhenstein.
CoQ10 may also interact with blood-sugar-reducing medications like insulin and certain cancer treatments.
How to Choose the Best CoQ10 Supplement for You
When choosing a CoQ10 supplement, it’s vital to follow the dosage recommended by your health care provider based on factors like your age, health status and current medications, says Routhenstein.
Opt for a CoQ10 supplement from a reputable brand that adheres to strict quality control standards, advises Routhenstein. She recommends choosing products evaluated and certified for quality by third-party organizations like the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) or National Sanitation Foundation (NSF) International.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
What are CoQ10 supplements used for?
CoQ10 supplements are often used to support heart health, manage high blood pressure, reduce migraine frequency and severity, improve exercise performance, mitigate statin side effects and address the age-related decline in CoQ10 levels, says Routhenstein.
Is there any downside to taking CoQ10 supplements?
CoQ10 is generally safe and well-tolerated in doses up to 1,200 milligrams per day, but some individuals may experience nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, indigestion or mild insomnia, according to research.
What vitamin should not be taken with CoQ10?
While there are no known interactions with vitamins or minerals, coenzyme Q10 can lower blood pressure and should not be combined with other herbs and supplements with hypotensive effects, according to Dr. Brady.
