Commissions we earn from partner links on this page do not affect our opinions or evaluations. Our editorial content is based on thorough research and guidance from the Forbes Health Advisory Board.
To help you find an effective and safe protein powder, the Forbes Health editorial team has determined the top choices of 2025 based on expert recommendations, independent lab testing results, ingredient lists, cost per serving and more.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) doesn’t validate the safety of protein powders before they hit store shelves, so it’s up to consumers to find the best product. Here are our recommendations.
Why You Can Trust Forbes Health
The Forbes Health editorial team prioritizes integrity in all of our vitamin and supplement rankings. Our rankings are based on expertise and professional recommendations from medical and nutrition experts and are free from conflicts of interest.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
Best Protein Powders
When reviewing protein powders, including the results of the third-party laboratory certificates of analysis (COAs) generated by Labdoor, it’s important to clarify several key terms:
Label accuracy. This is Labdoor’s measurement of whether the active ingredients in the test sample match the active ingredients listed on the product’s nutrition facts label.
Purity. This tests for the presence of heavy metals—including arsenic, cadmium, mercury and lead—and microbiology, including the presence of yeast/mold, coliforms, E. coli, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella and shigella.
Labdoor score. Labdoor calculates this overall quality score by combining a product’s purity and accuracy scores, ultimately assigning a rating between 0 and 100.
Labdoor grade. Labdoor converts a product’s Labdoor Score (0 to 100) to a letter grade ranging from A to F, helping consumers quickly understand a product’s overall quality with a familiar rating system.
Note: Forbes Health submitted specific batches of each protein powder to Labdoor for testing, and batch results may vary.

Optimum Nutrition 100% Gold Standard Whey scored a high rating in lab testing, is affordable and comes in 23 flavors, including mocha cappuccino, vanilla ice cream, chocolate mint and more. If you’re looking to minimize carb intake and avoid added sugars, Taylor Wallace, Ph.D., principal and CEO of the Think Healthy Group and a member of the Forbes Health Advisory Board, recommends this product. This powder “makes for a great protein shake,” he says. Dr. Wallace also notes that it’s available in a large bag at Costco, which helps keep the cost down, and that he prefers the vanilla and chocolate flavors.

For those dedicated to consuming protein powder as part of their daily diet, this budget-friendly protein powder is an attractive option. Registered dietitian and Forbes Advisory Board member Kara Collier highlights that MyProtein undergoes “extensive quality control testing.” She recommends the unflavored option in order to avoid processed ingredients like artificial sweeteners. “However, they do provide flavor options sweetened with stevia, which is a better alternative to other artificial sweeteners,” she says.

Methodology: How We Picked the Best Protein Powders of 2025
To determine the best protein powders of 2025, the Forbes Health editorial team consulted four accredited nutrition experts, who provided their product recommendations. Star ratings were then determined solely by the editorial team, factoring in data points like cost, protein per serving, nutritional profile, number of expert recommendations, flavor availability and third-party laboratory test results.
The breakdown of each data point is as follows:
Protein per serving (in grams): 25%. This indicates how much protein a consumer is getting with each serving of protein powder, which is often one of the most important factors to those taking the supplement.
Price per serving: 20%. We looked at cost per serving as opposed to total product cost to determine the most cost-effective option for consumers.
Number of expert recommendations: 20%. This pertains to how many Advisory Board members recommended the product.
Sugar per serving (in grams): 15%. Advisory Board members recommend opting for a protein powder that is lower in sugar.
Fiber per serving (in grams): 10%. Protein powders with higher fiber content can lead to feelings of fullness, which may help with weight management.
Labdoor score: 5%. This is the score assigned by the third-party laboratory that conducted product testing on behalf of Forbes Health. It measures label accuracy and product purity.
Number of flavors available: 5%. This metric takes into account the flavor variety of the protein powder.

Third-Party Laboratory Testing Methodology: How We Tested Protein Powders
Forbes Health facilitated independent, third-party laboratory testing for the top protein powders on our ranking through Labdoor in California. The laboratory was selected to evaluate protein powder quality due to its strict standards and commitment to consumer safety.
Lab technicians tested and evaluated our top protein powders on the following metrics, according to Labdoor:
Label accuracy, including protein and free amino acid content. This is Labdoor’s measurement of whether the amount of individual active ingredients in the test sample matches the amount listed on the product’s label. If the measured amount meets or exceeds the label claim, it receives a perfect score. If the amount falls below the label claim, the ingredient receives a progressive penalty—the further an ingredient deviates, the lower its score. The final accuracy score is the average of all individual ingredient scores.
Additionally, a “Pass” for this metric on the COA means the product tested at or above Labdoor’s certification limit, which allows for each active ingredient to deviate up to 5% under the label claim, with no upper limit for overage. A “Fail” means the product contained too little of a listed ingredient.
Product purity, specifically the presence of heavy metals—including arsenic, cadmium, mercury and lead—and microbiology, including yeast/mold, coliforms, E. coli, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella and shigella. If a substance is detected but still within the acceptable safety limit, it receives a progressive penalty, reducing the purity score. If any substance is found in quantities above the established safety limits, the product automatically receives a zero for purity.
A “Pass” for this metric on the COA means all results were at or below Labdoor’s certification limits, which follow established safety thresholds set by the U.S. Pharmacopeia (USP). A “Fail” means the product exceeded safety limits for contaminants.
Labdoor generated COAs for each top-ranking protein powder based on these testing results, detailing specific labeling accuracy and purity claims, as well as any indication of potentially harmful contaminants.
The Forbes Health editorial team carefully examined each laboratory-provided COA.

How to Choose the Best Protein Powder
When selecting a protein powder, experts recommend taking the following factors into consideration:
Added ingredients. Protein powders can be chock-full of added ingredients that aren’t healthy. “Take note of the ingredients and aim to avoid added sugars, fillers and artificial sweeteners,” says Brittany Werner, a registered dietitian nutritionist and Forbes Health Advisory Board member.
Nutritional profile. Werner recommends opting for protein powders with lower carbohydrate and fat content. “A quality protein supplement should not have more than 5 grams of carbohydrates or fats per serving,” she says. Dr. Jose Antonio, Ph.D., chief executive officer and co-founder of the International Society of Sports Nutrition and a Forbes Health Advisory Board member also recommends prioritizing protein content per serving and the supplement’s overall amino acid profile, especially its leucine content.
Third-party testing. As noted above, it’s best to look for a protein powder that has undergone third-party testing to confirm its quality, safety and label accuracy.
It’s important to be skeptical of marketing claims that sound too good to be true. Be wary of products that offer quick fixes, as protein powders are not a magic bullet for health and wellness.
“While protein supplements are a great way to add to your overall protein intake, it’s important to remember they are supplements meant to add to your balanced diet,” advises Werner. “Consumers should also beware of flashy marketing claims such as ‘fat-burning’ or ‘metabolism boosting.’ Often, these products are traditional whey protein with added ingredients, such as stimulants or fillers.”
Types of Protein Powder
There are several types of protein powders, each categorized by protein source and processing style.
Whey: Whey protein is a byproduct of the cheesemaking process. “This is a high-quality, complete protein that is typically well tolerated and easily absorbed,” says Werner. “It’s best for muscle recovery and boosting overall protein intake.”
Casein: Casein is also a complete protein. It’s the most prominent protein found in milk and is responsible for milk’s white color. “This is a slower-digesting protein that is ideal for increasing feelings of fullness and supporting recovery,” explains Werner.
Egg white: Another type of animal-derived protein powder is made from egg whites, which may be a good choice for those looking for products with a simple ingredient list.
Plant-based: For those seeking a non-dairy alternative to whey or casein, there are many plant-based protein sources, such as beans, nuts, seeds, soy and more.
Collagen: This type of protein is a major structural component of the body’s connective tissue. “This protein is not a complete protein and lacks the amino acids needed for muscle building,” notes Werner. “However, it will support joint, gut and skin health.” Collagen peptides or hydrolyzed collagen supplements feature collagen sourced from animals.
Additionally, protein powders can be categorized as concentrate, isolate or hydrolysate, which is based on the concentration and the processing of the protein. With concentrate products, processing of the protein removes water, ash, lactose and some minerals. Meanwhile, isolate products provide the highest concentration of protein (90% or higher), and processing removes significant amounts of fat and lactose. Hydrolysate is often considered the predigested form of protein and may allow for easier and faster absorption, as it’s already broken down into peptides.
“Whey protein, especially whey isolate, is often considered superior due to its rapid digestion, high leucine content and strong support for muscle protein synthesis,” adds Dr. Antonio, “Casein, a slower-digesting protein, is ideal for prolonged amino acid release. Plant-based proteins like pea, soy and rice can also be effective, especially when combined to provide a complete amino acid profile,” he says.
How to Take Protein Powder
Protein powder instructions often advise mixing one or two scoops of the dry powder into a beverage of your choice.
“While both pre- and post-workout consumption can be beneficial, the timing of intake is much less important than the total daily intake,” says Dr. Antonio.
Indeed, research on when to take protein powder is conflicting. A 2023 meta-analysis in Baylor University Medical Center Proceedings notes that while some studies show consuming protein after a workout leads to greater benefits of increasing protein synthesis and muscle growth, others have found taking protein before resistance exercise offers more benefits, as it replenishes amino acids and increases protein synthesis before the workout begins[1]Patel V, Aggarwal K, Dhawan A, et al. Protein supplementation: the double-edged sword. Proc (Bayl Univ Med Cent). 2023;37(1):118-126. .
“The body will utilize supplemental protein no matter what time of day it’s consumed,” notes Werner. “If you have a sensitive stomach, you may want to avoid drinking a protein shake within 60 minutes of starting an intense workout. Consuming protein after your workout will help with recovery and muscle repair.”
Benefits of Protein Powder
While often touted by athletes and fitness enthusiasts, many people can benefit from protein powder. “Protein powder supplementation is beneficial for individuals who struggle to meet their daily protein needs through whole foods alone,” says Dr. Antonio. “This includes athletes, bodybuilders, older adults, individuals recovering from injuries and those following plant-based diets with limited protein sources.”
“Protein supplementation can be particularly useful when aiming for muscle gain, weight loss or convenience in a busy lifestyle,” he adds.
Research suggests protein powder supplementation may enhance muscle mass and performance, as well as manage weight.
“[Protein powder] can improve body composition by enhancing lean muscle mass while promoting fat loss, particularly when paired with resistance training,” notes Dr. Antonio.
Additionally, research suggests protein powder supplementation may improve aerobic capacity, positively affect metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors and even provide better glycemic control in people with diabetes.

Does Protein Powder Help With Weight Loss?
Protein powder may help with weight loss, according to research. A 2022 systematic review in the Journal of Obesity & Metabolic Syndrome that examined the effect of whey protein on weight, body fat, lean body mass, fat-free mass and waist circumference found evidence supporting the use of whey protein to improve body composition, particularly when paired with resistance training and a reduction in calorie consumption[2]Pasiakos SM, McLellan TM, Lieberman HR. The effects of protein supplements on muscle mass, strength, and aerobic and anaerobic power in healthy adults: a systematic review. Sports Med. 2015;45(1):111-131. .
“The macronutrient protein helps support a calorie deficit by helping to keep us full and satisfied between meals,” explains Werner. “Protein also aids in preserving our lean muscle mass while in a deficit, allowing our body to prioritize burning body fat.”
Indeed, a 2020 analysis in Toxicology Reports links high-protein diets to an increase in satiety, or feeling full, and a decrease in body weight and fat mass[3]Moon J, Koh G. Clinical Evidence and Mechanisms of High-Protein Diet-Induced Weight Loss. J Obes Metab Syndr. 2020;29(3):166-173. .
If you’re using protein powder for weight management purposes, Werner recommends opting for whey or casein varieties. “Whey protein is typically lower in carbohydrates and overall calories, making it a great option for those eating in a calorie deficit,” she says. “Casein protein offers a slower release and will help keep you full for longer periods.”
Protein Powder Side Effects
Researchers note complications related to protein powder supplements include undigested protein and impaired gut health, which may lead to symptoms like diarrhea, stomach pain, nausea, dehydration and decreased appetite.
Meanwhile, protein powders may not be suitable for everyone. “There are a few groups that may need to avoid protein supplements,” says Werner. “Those with chronic kidney disease should discuss their protein intake with their medical provider. Anyone with severe allergies or intolerances should be diligent about label reading to avoid any potential issues.”

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
Is protein powder safe?
Despite the numerous health benefits associated with protein powders, the quality of these products varies widely. Research indicates some protein powder supplements may have detectable levels of heavy metals (though it’s worth noting that the 2020 analysis in Toxicology Reports found that typical intake would not result in adverse health effects due to heavy metals. “You always want to choose brands that have been third-party tested for quality,” says Werner. “NSF Certified and Informed Choice are two very reputable testing corporations.”
What is protein powder good for?
As noted above, a high-quality protein powder can provide an array of health benefits, ranging from enhanced muscle mass to weight management.
Which protein powder should I take as a beginner?
“Whey protein is often recommended for beginners as it’s typically well-tolerated and provides all the amino acids, making it a complete protein replacement,” says Werner. Dr. Antonio agrees, adding, “beginners should consider whey protein for its high bioavailability and muscle recovery benefits.”
How much protein do I need per day?
The recommended daily allowance for protein is currently 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight for adults 18 and older. However, the exact amount of protein you may need varies based on factors such as sex, age, weight and whether you’re pregnant or lactating.
