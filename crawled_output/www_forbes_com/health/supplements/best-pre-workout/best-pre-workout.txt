Commissions we earn from partner links on this page do not affect our opinions or evaluations. Our editorial content is based on thorough research and guidance from the Forbes Health Advisory Board.
If you’re looking for the best pre-workout but are unsure which type to purchase, you’re likely not alone. Not only are there many brands available, but pre-workout itself is sold in various forms like powders, pills and drinks.
Pre-workout supplements are designed for consumption before exercise to enhance athletic performance, especially when you’re feeling low on energy. Most pre-workouts contain specific vitamins, minerals and other ingredients such as caffeine, beta-alanine, taurine and creatine, purported to help increase energy and endurance.
To pick the best supplements out there, the Forbes Health editorial team consulted a panel of five  accredited experts, who provided their recommendations for the best pre-workouts of 2025. The Forbes Health editorial team determined star ratings based on cost, whether it includes artificial ingredients, number of flavor options, number of expert recommendations and third-party testing. Read on to learn about the top pre-workout picks that made our list.
Note: All product prices are accurate as of publication and are subject to change.
Why You Can Trust Forbes Health

Our rankings are based on expertise and professional recommendations from medical and nutrition experts and are free from conflicts of interest.

What Is Pre-Workout?
Pre-workout is a multi-ingredient supplement blending a combination of stimulants that can promote maximum energy, focus, strength and velocity during exercise. Most contain caffeine and a mix of other ingredients like vitamins, minerals and branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), all designed to performance-enhance your workout, says Wendy Bazilian, doctor of public health, nutritionist and author of the Eat Clean, Stay Lean series.
Consumed 30 to 60 minutes prior to exercise (that’s how long it can take for a pre-workout to kick in), the supplement typically features caffeine of varying amounts (excluding the caffeine-free versions), which has long been hailed for its ability to improve a slew of exercise benefits, including muscular endurance and movement velocity.
What Does Pre-Workout Do?
Pre-workout is intended to help build muscle, increase focus and provide extra energy, according to the National Academy of Sports Medicine. The ingredients in pre-workout supplements, such as caffeine, beta-alanine, amino acids and creatine, work together to bring about these possible benefits.
When to Take Pre-Workout Supplements
Pre-workout supplements are usually taken about 15 to 30 minutes prior to exercise, but can also be consumed during your workout. Read the label instructions on the pre-workout you are considering to see what is recommended.

Pros and Cons of Pre-Workout
While post-workout nutrition and recovery is crucial, what takes place prior to exercise is just as important, says Bazilian. The best pre-workout can provide a variety of benefits including aiding in performance, strength and stamina. “Such a supplement is also intended to benefit muscle gain and recovery to help you continue training at your best,” she says.
A body of studies show pre-workout is effective at improving anaerobic peak and power. Research also proposes the following benefits:
Improved cognitive function
Increased resting energy expenditure (REE)
Enhanced muscular endurance
Increased blood flow during workouts
Minimizing muscle fatigue
While many pre-workout formulations are generally considered safe, they can also produce a few side effects in some individuals, including heart abnormalities, skin reactions and nausea. It’s also essential for consumers to keep a tally of their overall ingestion of certain ingredients such as caffeine and niacin, as too much of both of these supplements can cause adverse reactions in many people.
Additionally, not all pre-workouts are third-party tested, which means some brands may include ingredients not listed on the label, or a higher or lower amount of listed ingredients.

Are Pre-Workout Supplements Safe?
Not everyone requires a pre-workout, especially if your exercise routine is of a lighter nature. If you want a boost for harder workouts, follow the dose according to the instructions, or you might experience heart abnormalities and nausea, not to mention a reduction in sleep duration or even insomnia, given the caffeine content.
“A pre-workout should not be taken in place of a health-promoting and performance-supporting diet,” says Bazilian. In sports nutrition, an individualized approach is required for eating and supplementation, meaning what works for one person may not work for you.
Does Your Energy Crash After Taking Pre-Workout?
Those who are sensitive to certain ingredients contained in pre-workout supplements may experience a decrease in energy levels as the stimulating effects of these ingredients are broken down and cleared from the body by the liver and kidneys. Caffeine, for example, may cause symptoms like reduced energy, drowsiness and decreased alertness as the stimulant wears off.
What Ingredients Are in Pre-Workout Supplements?
Ingredients found in pre-workout supplements vary but may include:
INGREDIENT
BENEFIT
Beta-alanine
This amino acid improves exercise performance, particularly high-intensity interval training (HIIT).
Caffeine
As a pre-workout ingredient,caffeine is effective in increasing alertness and helping individuals feel less tired during workouts. It can also promote endorphin release and improve neuromuscular function.
Creatine
Creatine is most effective for strength training, as it helps provide energy for muscles, promoting the ability to train longer and with heavier weights.
Citrulline
Helps enhance nitric oxide, which increases blood flow, and in turn, can help improve resistance and HIIT performance.
Taurine
Purported to help improve recovery from training and limit muscle damage.
B vitamins
May help increase physical performance and reduce fatigue.
See More See Less
How Long Does Pre-Workout Last?
The type and amount of ingredients in pre-workout is what determines how long its effects last, along with the specific person consuming it. Research suggests that creatine reaches peak concentration in the body approximately one hour after consumption and remains at elevated levels for up to four hours. Caffeine, on the other hand, reaches peak levels within 30 minutes to one hour after consumption and can remain in the body for up to 10 hours, depending on an individual’s personal health history.
Are Pre-Workouts Worth Taking?
Pre-workout supplements may be worth taking for individuals whose exercise routines involve greater intensity activities like strength training and HIIT. However, it’s important to make sure that the pre-workout supplement of your choosing is third-party tested for heavy metals and other harmful ingredients. Consult with your health care provider to determine if it’s safe for you to add pre-workout supplements to your wellness routine.
Where to Buy the Best Pre-Workout Supplements
Pre-workout supplements are available in a variety of retail and online stores such as Amazon, Target, GNC, Walmart and more.
How to Choose the Best Pre-Workout for You
When selecting a pre-workout, Bazilian says to be mindful of unwanted added ingredients, such as sugar, and to focus on products that add to your current lifestyle and a nutrient-rich eating approach.
“You should choose one that shows and follows GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) on the bottle—imperative for ensuring the product is processed to the best standards and that checkboxes are safely met, including third-party testing.” This covers each step of the supplement manufacturing process from ingredient sourcing, formulation, labeling and packaging.
The cost of pre-workouts can add up quickly, so be mindful of how they fit into your budget. Bazilian warns against the continuation of any supplement not to your liking, be that taste, texture or if it disagrees with your digestion. There are plenty of others up for grabs.
Final Thoughts
Naked Energy’s Pre-Workout tops our list for the best pre-workout due to the fact that it is recommended by multiple experts and is affordable, third-party tested and features a clean ingredient list. Optimum Nutrition’s Essential Amino Energy and Legion’s Pulse Pre-Workout are our second and third-place winners, respectively.
