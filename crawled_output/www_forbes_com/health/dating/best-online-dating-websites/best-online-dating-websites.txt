Facebook Dating users are typically dissatisfied with the platform, citing technical issues, poor match quality and a high number of sham profiles. However, many users appreciate that the service is entirely free to use, and some individuals have found successful matches and long-term relationships.
Pros & ConsEnhanced security with required photo verificationOffers up to seven pronouns to choose from, including nonbinary, cis man/woman and trans man/woman“Go back” feature available at no additional costOffers curated matches for free (often a paid feature)Must have a Facebook account that is at least 30 days old and in good standing to use Facebook Dating, according to the companyNo capacity to “boost” user’s profileMessaging is the only communication featureLimited information about the app is available on the Facebook Dating website, meaning users need to create a profile to understand how it works	Why We Like Facebook DatingFacebook Dating, located within the main Facebook app or website, integrates a user’s Facebook activity to connect them with others who share similar interests. This includes factoring in events that you may be attending or groups you’re already a part of within the social network.Facebook offers safety tips and information on locating the dating app via the “How to Find” menu option on its Facebook Dating website. However, though you can navigate to Facebook Dating from the desktop website, the dating services are only accessible through the app on a phone or tablet.Who Might Like Facebook Dating:Older adults looking for long-term connections and serious relationships.Users who prefer using a mobile app with ample features.People seeking a budget-friendly dating app.Our Experience with Facebook DatingOverall, our Facebook Dating tester had a positive experience using Facebook Dating for one week, despite encountering fake profiles and receiving some spam and inappropriate messages.“Using the app was very simple, especially for someone who has been on Facebook before.” – Lisa, 48, Waco, TexasOur tester said Facebook Dating was very easy to set up, adding that she didn’t have to do much at all thanks to already being a Facebook user. She also found that the viewed profiles appeared genuine, with meaningful conversation occurring after two messages. She encountered a limited number of what she perceived to be fake profiles and received a “manageable” amount of spam. Lisa received three inappropriate messages and one spam message during the week she tried the dating platform.Given its free suite of features, Facebook’s biggest positive from Lisa’s experience was its perceived value. Lisa called Facebook Dating “one of the most positive experiences [I’ve had], particularly for a free platform.”

A high occurrence of technical issues and fraudulent profiles, paired with high subscription costs, leads to mixed consumer reviews about OkCupid. Glitches noted by individual users include being matched with members located in different countries and frequent prompts to upgrade to premium plans. Some users had positive experiences, however, noting a questionnaire that focuses on compatibility and free messaging features.
Pros & ConsSupports all types of relationshipsOffers 60+ “Identity Tags” for users to attach to their profilesAbility to set your profile to “located anywhere” to view matches from both near and far20 orientation options availablePotential to experience platform bugsLogging in via Facebook is no longer available via iOS appAccounts are deleted after two years of inactivityUsers won’t be shared information as to why certain conversations disappear	Why We Like OKCupidThe OKCupid dating platform offers a wide variety of profile prompts to choose from to customize one’s profile. Users can connect with potential matches by sending them a “Like” or “Intro” message to make a first impression, as well as by sending a Superlike to show they are particularly interested in another user.Who Might Like OkCupid:Individuals interested in a variety of prompt options to utilize on their dating profileUsers looking for genuine connections and thoughtful interactionsPeople looking for a variety of identity and orientation options to customize their profileOur Experience with OkCupidOverall, our reviewers found the experience of using OKCupid to be a positive one. Multiple testers experienced high engagement and meaningful conversations very quickly.“Generally positive, with a higher percentage of genuine conversations than other apps.” — Jillian, 22, Boston, MABased on internal testing, those who tried OkCuid found that its wide range of questions asked to users led to fruitful conversations quickly. Also, because so much detail was involved in the account creation process, our testers found that many of the encountered profiles appeared to be genuine.Passport, a feature that allows OkCupid users to connect with anyone across the world, is something that multiple internal testers called out for keeping conversation going. Though, with that high engagement comes an increase in inappropriate messages, which were described as a “common issue” during the trial period.

Tinder users express both positive and negative experiences using the dating app. Many individuals appreciate the high number of users and potential to create long-term relationships on the platform. Among several negative factors, however, users note encountering a high rate of fake profiles and scammers. Meanwhile, concerns over the app banning and shadowbanning users without cause and a high focus on monetization leads to many negative experiences. Billing and customer service practices have also been scrutinized in a negative light.
Pros & ConsUsers can unmatch from someone at any time.Offers a “Profile Verification” feature, which confirms users are who they say they are with a blue check mark attached to their profileThree paid subscription tiers available: Tinder Plus, Tinder Gold and Tinder PlatinumIn some instances, Tinder will sponsor weddings or send couples free Tinder “swag.”Duplicate or incorrect charges from the platform are possible.App may crash in some instances.Users cannot update their name or age once they’ve created an account.One reviewer noted the “Secret Admirer” feature can feel “gimmicky.”	Why We Like TinderLaunched in 2012, Tinder is a popular global dating app with the goal of helping its users find real connections. Tinder connects users with criteria such as location-based technology, age, gender, orientation filters and more.Nearly 60% of users are between the ages of 18 and 30, and the platform offers up to nine sexual orientation options as well as more than 50 gender identities to choose from.Who Might Like Tinder:Individuals looking for a casual connection without commitmentThose interested in a platform with a large, global user baseUsers who will appreciate a high volume of  matchesOur Experience with TinderOverall, two of our internal testers found match and engagement on Tinder to be high, with lower quality in the actual content of conversations.“Best for volume, but meaningful conversations are rare.” – Caleb, 24, Santa Barbara, CAAbove all our testers found Tinder’s suite of features to be intuitive and easy to use. Its swipe-based matching system makes finding connections a straightforward process. However, like many of our high-volume platforms with lots of users, spam, ghosting and general apathy were frequently experienced.These flaws were mitigated by paid features, however. Testers appreciated Passport mode, which enables matches beyond your physical location, as well as the unlimited swipes offered to subscribers to increase the size of their dating pool. Conversations remained shallow, but the chance to connect with more people increased one’s odds of meaningful connection. That said, our testers did find Tinder to offer a strong user experience even in its free version.

Consumer sentiments about Match are negative due to a number of issues, including low match quality, high subscription fees, poor customer service and a prevalence of fake user profiles. Individuals cite limited meaningful interactions and dubious account restriction policies that combine with other negative concerns to give the dating platform a scammy feel.
Pros & ConsMatch hosts face-to-face dating events in select cities.Super Likes do not expire.Match offers the ability for users to hide their profiles for 24 hours with the “Undercover” feature, allowing users to browse and view profiles without being on their “Who Viewed Me” lists.Users can opt to receive matches via email if they prefer through Match by Mail.Super Likes are exclusive to paid subscribers“Profile unavailable” notifications when opening chats and disappearing Likes are possibleUsers may receive phishing scam emails posing as Match.If you delete a chat, those messages are gone for good and cannot be resurfaced; Match also automatically removes messages from its records 180 days after they’ve been sent.	Why We Like MatchFounded in 1995, Match—a self-described trailblazer in the industry—aims to help single adults find their perfect match. It’s available in 16 countries and in three languages, on the iOS App Store and Google Play Store.Who Might Like Match:Users looking for a longstanding platform in the industryThose looking to attend in-person dating events, in addition to the online dating platformIndividuals interested in video chat capabilities within the security of a dating platformOur Experience with MatchOne reviewer found the platform to provide decent engagement, however, she was not pleased with the inconsistency of interactions and spam messages.“Decent platform for engagement but plagued by spam and inconsistent interaction quality.”–Jillian, 22, Boston, MAGenerally speaking, our testers had negative experiences using Match. The aforementioned spam messages remained a consistent issue, and that issue was compounded by the fact that engagement was on the lower side during testing. One tester in particular felt these factors translated to an experience that provided low value compared to the overall cost of membership.

Overall, individuals are disappointed with Coffee Meets Bagel and think it’s not worth the high fees. Users cite a number of complaints about the dating platform, including frequent technical glitches, a prevalence of fake profiles and few free basic features. However, some individuals appreciate high match quality and potential for long-term relationships through connections on the app.
Pros & ConsUsers can mark certain preferences they feel strongly about as “Dealbreakers”Subscribers are able to send free monthly “flowers” to another user (kind of like a Super Like)Subscribers can gain access to “Bonus Bagels,” or additional suggested profiles to potentially match withPremium preferences for subscribers allow for filters that include height, education, family plans, smoking and drinking habits, exercise and moreAll inactive chats close after seven daysMay not be the best choice for those interested in more casual datingLGBTQIA+ pool of matches may be low in some areasMay need to purchase “beans,” the platform’s in-app currency, to utilize some features	Why We Like Coffee Meets BagelCoffee Meets Bagel is an online dating platform intended for building serious connections. Its users or “bagels” receive a daily batch of match suggestions at noon, however users may also browse potential matches on their Discover page. Users may also use the app’s internal currency “beans” to purchase additional features within the platform.Who Might Like Coffee Meets Bagel:People looking for a serious connectionIndividuals interested in receiving match suggestions and the ability to search for themUsers who prefer a slower-paced matching processOur Experience with Coffee Meets BagelOur reviewers found Coffee Meets Bagel to be slow-paced, with less engagement compared to other popular platforms.“Stable but less engaging compared to more mainstream apps like Tinder or Bumble.” — Jillian, 22, Boston, MAThis sense of low engagement on the platform appeared to be an achilles heel of the platform for multiple testers, with one suggesting the time spent felt like a “waiting game with little reward.” Progress was slow in starting meaningful conversation, but one tester noted that opting for paid features did help mitigate these drawbacks.

Feelings about Hinge, a dating platform often lauded for those seeking long-term relationships, are mixed among users. On one hand, individuals appreciate the app’s focus on authentic conversation prompts. However, arbitrary account bans, technical glitches, paywalls and customer service concerns may outweigh positive experiences.
Pros & ConsHinge learns more about a users type to provide them more curated match recommendations via “Smart Matches”Sends reply reminders to users to limit “accidental ghosting”Encourages users to share religion, education and day-to-day life on their profilesUsers must respond to three prompts in order to activate their account, which can be swapped out for different prompts at any timeDeleting Hinge app does not cancel paid subscriptionsHinge cannot directly issue refunds for iOS purchasesNot available via web versionMay not provide specific detail as to why a user’s account may be banned	Why We Like HingeHinge is an online dating app that the company claims is “designed to be deleted” once a user has found their match. Hinge is available to use for free, as well as via its premium Hinge+ or HingeX subscriptions.Available to iOS and Android users, users can utilize features such as “Match Notes” to better express what they are looking for to potential matches and “Comment Filters” to limit negative interactions on the platform.Who Might Like Hinge:Users looking to make serious connectionsIndividuals hoping to make connections with someone who engages in thoughtful conversationThose looking to craft personalized and in-depth profiles to meet matchesOur Experience with HingeOverall, two of our reviewers had positive experiences using Hinge, , noting thoughtful and high-quality conversations.“Highly positive experience with thoughtful conversations and an appealing user interface.” –Ashley, (declined to provide demographic information)Compared to other high-volume platforms, Hinge provided our testers with a thoughtful and engaging testing experience. The process of commenting and liking users felt more purposeful than the swipe-based model offered by the likes of Tinder. However, users had mixed experiences when trying paid features. While some felt premium features helped engagement, others say the cost didn’t match the added value.
Methodology: How We Picked the Best Dating Apps and Sites of 2025
To determine the best dating apps and websites for 2025, the Forbes Health editorial team analyzed data for online dating platforms available via the iOS and Google Play stores, as well as desktop websites, combing over a variety of metrics that we determined to be most important to consumers.
To evaluate each dating platform, our team of editors and researchers independently collected data on a variety of metrics, including subscription fees, features available on the app, communication methods, user ratings, safety features and more. Forbes Health also conducted a survey of 1,600 dating app users and commissioned six dating platform testers to try our top platforms for two weeks. Survey data and tester feedback was incorporated into our final ranking. Star ratings were then determined solely by the editorial team.
Specifically, Forbes Health examined the following metrics:
Cost 30%
General app features, such as intake questionnaire, match filtering, profile boosting options, communication features and defining relationship goals 25%
Consumer survey data (NPS) 25%
Consumer Sentiment Index (CSI) 12.5%
Safety features, including photo verification and profile blocking 5%
Hands-on tester rating 2.5%

How to Make a Good Dating Profile
“A great dating profile is like a little window into your world,” says Judy Ho, Ph.D., a triple board certified and licensed clinical and forensic neuropsychologist and Forbes Health Advisory Board member. That might sound easy to establish, but many people can find it difficult to get the wording exactly right.
A 2024 Forbes Health survey revealed these eight green flags that make for a strong dating profile.
Having a good sense of humor (82%)
Having hobbies, interests or pastimes (80%)
Portraying a good sense of style (76%)
Showing an interest in travel (71%)
Featuring a pet in a photo (65%)
Featuring family members in a photo (56%)
Adding voice notes to a bio (49%)
Sharing political views (43%)
Aspects like general negativity, an emphasis on material possessions, doctored photos and poor grammar were cited as some of the biggest turn offs in a dating profile.
How Should I Describe Myself on a Dating App?
To bring out the best in your dating profile, Dr. Ho offers these essential tips:
Be descriptive. “Instead of saying ‘I’m kind and adventurous,’ give a glimpse into your life that demonstrates that—like, ‘I volunteer at the animal shelter on weekends and just got back from hiking in Zion,’” suggests Dr. Ho. This also means avoiding clichés, aiming to construct a profile that conveys what it’s truly like to spend time with you.
Express your needs up front. To find your ideal partner, Dr. Ho says she believes it’s best to be direct about your needs. For example, you might say “‘I love traveling and am looking for a partner who enjoys the same.”’
Be yourself. “People are drawn to confidence and authenticity,” says Dr. Ho. That means avoiding language that makes your profile sound too polished. And, while nice pictures are essential, find ones that look natural as opposed to full-blown glamour shots. Pictures should also convey your interests and offer a window into your personality.
It’s worth noting that dating is almost always complex, and there is no exact science to success. While many of these tips may set you on a path toward finding love, using your intuition can be helpful too.
Online Dating Red Flags
A healthy and beneficial relationship requires supportive partners. Dr. Ho suggests these red flags may be cause for concern if spotted in your online partner:
Non-stop contact and big emotional declarations early on in a relationship may be signs of “love bombing” manipulation tactics at work
Inconsistencies or vague answers about their life
Avoiding video chats or postponing meeting in person
Oversharing too quickly or asking about your vulnerabilities early on
Pushing boundaries around sex, exclusivity or money
Blaming you or making you feel guilty when you express a need or concern
If red flags like these start to pile up, it’s important to work through that negative experience and move forward. “It can feel so disappointing when we think we found our match, and it falls through or we have been deceived,” explains Olivia Verhulst, a licensed psychotherapist and Forbes Health Advisory Board member. “Please know if this has happened to you, you are not alone.”

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
How much do online dating sites cost?
Costs among dating services vary significantly. While some sites listed in this ranking, like Facebook Dating, are completely free, most have a restricted free tier with a paid subscription option. These subscriptions typically cost anywhere from $10 to $40 per month on average, though prices may differ if paying weekly, biannually or annually.
In short, it’s possible to find a dating service that matches almost any budget.
Is online dating safe?
While online dating is safe for many people, it’s not without risk. The possibility for so-called romance scams remains prevalent. In 2024 alone, the FTC Sentinel Data Book cataloged 60,923 romance scams worth a combined total of $1.2 billion in lost funds for unsuspecting victims[1]FTC Consumer Sentinel Data Book. Federal Trade Commission. Accessed 4/15/2025. .
The odds of being fooled by a romance scam may seem low when considering the large number of people using online dating platforms. But all users, whether they’re tech savvy or not, should keep their eyes peeled for this ever-present threat. While the number of reported scams falls each year as awareness grows, the financial impact on victims has increased.
What are the safest dating sites?
Among 1,600 dating app users surveyed for this article, all reported high prevalence of bots and spam across all the sites and apps. These findings suggest individuals using dating platforms should be wary of scams regardless of the app or service they choose.
How do I avoid fake dating profiles and scams?
The threat of encountering a romance scam may sound scary, but the good news is the scammer’s playbook tends to be fairly universal. Keep these tips from the Federal Trade Commission in mind as you start spending time on dating platforms and social media sites like Facebook, X and Instagram.
Don’t send money, crypto or gift cards to anyone you don’t know: The primary goal of any romance scammer is to extract money from a victim. As such, the most obvious way to avoid being scammed is to not let yourself be convinced to send any form of money. In addition to cash wire transfers, cryptocurrency and gift cards have become an increasingly popular avenue for funneling money, as these are far more difficult, and sometimes impossible, to trace.
Disregard mentions of investment opportunities and promises of getting rich: Another popular scam tactic involves the scammer telling the victim that they can be rich by investing in crypto or other business opportunities. If this topic comes up over the course of online dating, it’s a red flag.
Reverse image search: Scammers often steal pictures from existing social media profiles to create their fake persona. To combat this, go to Google and click the camera-shaped “search by image” button in the search bar. Simply upload or paste a link to the image of your romantic match to see if the image is attached to any other profiles.
Suggest video calls or meeting in person: Scammers want to remain anonymous, which means they’ll disregard almost any opportunity to meet in person or conduct a live video call. Be on the lookout for excuses like missed flights or broken webcams.
Watch out for AI: A more modern scam tactic involves scammers using AI-generated videos to substitute for video chats. These videos may look like someone doing a traditional video call, and they may even use the victim’s name through an artificial voice. However, these can be easily distinguished by asking specific questions during the call. If the speaker never pauses for conversation or seems to ignore the topics being discussed, it’s likely a pre-recorded, and fake, video.
What is the most used dating site in the U.S.?
According to 2023 Pew Research data, Tinder is the most popular dating site in the U.S., with 46% of respondents saying they’ve used the service. This was followed by Match (31%) and Bumble (28%)[2]Vogels E, McClain C. Key findings about online dating in the U.S. Pew Research Center. Accessed 4/17/2025. .
Which dating sites and apps are completely free?
Facebook Dating tops this list, and it’s one of the few dating sites that is completely free.
Most dating sites like Tinder, Hinge and Bumble offer a free tier with basic access. However, many critical features may remain behind a paywall. In many cases you may be unable to message matches, or you may not see who “likes” your profile. You may also be limited by the amount of likes you can send.
What is the best dating site for beginners?
Selecting the best dating site depends on a wide variety of individual factors. If you’re on a tight budget, try a free service like Facebook Dating. If long-term relationships are more important to you over casual hookups, a profile-centric option like Hinge or Bumble may be preferred.
As a beginner, the choice of site or app is perhaps less important than setting realistic expectations. Regardless of the app you choose, be aware that finding a decent match may take time and there could be some rejection involved in getting there. Also, if a match comes up quickly and seems too good to be true, it may not hurt to check for evidence of a scam.
Are dating apps worth it?
The answer to that question is a matter of personal taste. However, given that there are free avenues to online dating, there’s almost no downside to giving them a shot as long as you’re vigilant about monitoring for signs of scams. The process may take time and it won’t work for everyone, but, especially if it doesn’t cost anything, it’s worth considering.
