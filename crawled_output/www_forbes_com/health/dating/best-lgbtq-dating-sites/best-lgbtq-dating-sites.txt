As many as 51% of LGBTQ+ individuals in the U.S. have used a dating site or app before, compared to just 28% of the straight population, according to a 2022 Pew Research survey[1]Gelles-Watnick R. About half of lesbian, gay and bisexual adults have used online dating. Pew Research Center. Accessed 5/14/2025. .
Despite the popularity of online dating, finding an app or site that’s tailored to your unique dating preferences can be challenging. To assist in your search, Forbes Health leveraged weeks of data research and user testing to assemble an inclusive ranking that takes subscription pricing, user reviews, gender-specific options and more into account. Read on for the top LGBTQ+ dating sites and apps on the market today.

The Best Queer Dating App	Taimi
5.0
All ratings are determined solely by our editorial team.Monthly Subscription Cost: Prices start at $5.99 Free Version Available: Yes, with limited features Availability: Android app, iOS app Who It’s For: Users who identify on the LGBTQ+ spectrum Popular For: Short-term and long-term relationships Match System: Swiping system of curated matches Standout Features: Taimi has multiple gender options and 15 sexual orientation selections that can be changed at any time. It also has a Private Card feature, which allows users to share select images or videos with a chosen group. Why We Like TaimiIf you’re looking for an all-purpose LGBTQ+ dating app that serves a wide range of sexual orientations, Taimi may be a good choice. With a base of 27 million users across 138 countries, users can likely find all types of relationship styles. We love that the app has more than a dozen different sexual orientation options that can be changed at any time. The platform’s emphasis on diversity and gender-fluidity is just one of the reasons Taimi is our top choice.Users willing to pay for Taimi’s premium features can find three budget tiers: Bronze, Silver and Gold. Most requested premium features, such as trending search and profile boosting, can be accessed at the Silver tier. As the most budget-friendly app on this list, Taimi offers users a great value.Who Might Like Taimi:All members of the LGBTQ+ community, including those identifying as gay, transgender, bisexual and morePeople who may be unsure about the type of relationship they’d like to haveAnyone seeking a budget-friendly dating appOur Experience with TaimiOur testers appreciated Taimi for its smooth setup, friendly conversations, familiar design and effective paid features. However, glitches—particularly with regard to ignoring the tester’s chosen sexual orientation—were present.“I had a mixed experience with Taimi. The paid version improves the experience, but its high bot activity is concerning.”— Ashley (declined to provide demographic information)Through two weeks of testing with the paid and free versions of Taimi, general app use and setup were consistently praised. However, the abundance of messages overnight, especially when restricted to the free version of the app, proved burdensome.Activity on the platform picked up once testers unlocked paid features, such as the ability to message those who had “liked” the tester’s profile. “I realized that since I now have access to view all of my likes, every time I message one of [the users who liked me], they always answer very quickly, and the conversation is always really great,” Ashley says of her experience with a paid Taimi subscription.

Given the app’s goal of supporting the LGBTQ+ community, Taimi users appreciate its central mission and its sleek interface. That said, some individuals complain that the platform’s high subscription cost and restrictive free features are a source of frustration. The app’s matchmaking system is also flawed, as it’s sometimes known to ignore specific preferences, even one’s sexual orientation. The abundance of seemingly fake profiles make finding a suitable match on Taimi all the more difficult.

The Best Dating App for Lesbians	Her
4.9
All ratings are determined solely by our editorial team.Monthly Subscription Cost: Prices start at $19.99 Free Version Available: Yes, with limited features Availability: Android app, iOS app Who It’s For: Queer women, nonbinary and transgender women seeking women Popular For: Women hoping to find meaningful romantic connections with other women Match System: Swiping system of curated matches Standout Features: Her has a large collection of options for users to express their pronouns, gender identities, sexual orientations and more. It also has Pride Pins to showcase specific interests and a friend feature that indicates a user is looking for platonic connections Why We Like HerHer launched in 2015 with the hope of being the first dating app for lesbian, bisexual and queer people. Since 2023, the company says it’s made more than 300 million matches across 15 million users, making it a viable choice for women seeking women.We love this app as an ad-free option built exclusively with women in mind. Pride Pins also offer users a creative way to express their interests, political leanings and love language. Likes, matches, messaging and basic community interactions are also all available for free.Who Might Like Her:Queer, nonbinary and transwomen seeking other womenIndividuals looking for a long-term relationshipPeople who may be open to making new friends in the queer, nonbinary or trans communityOur Experience with HerOur tester says she appreciated the many ways users can customize their profiles on the Her app and found that many conversations appeared to be genuine, though, some messages and “like” counts may have been bot-generated. The tester didn’t like the high amount of repeat profiles that she encountered but did appreciate the friend feature that focuses on platonic connections.“I had a decent experience with real people, but I had concerns about repeated profiles and potentially fake notifications.” — Ashley (declined to provide demographic information)Testing of Her started slow over the first few days, but Ashley appreciated the ability to tailor profiles with aspects like zodiac signs and political affiliation. The high number of likes and requests, often hundreds overnight, seemed too good to be true, however. Ashley also noticed multiple instances where messages failed to send to users who had supposedly liked their profile.It took about one week for Ashley to have a meaningful conversation on Her, and those productive chats grew more frequent once paid features were activated. “I woke up to three responses from previous matches, and I responded to them all,” wrote Ashley of Her’s premium experience. “The most interesting one for me today was a conversation with an EMT who is also a part-time bio/chem professor.”	Consumer Sentiment Index

Even though many users report finding meaningful relationships on the Her dating app, some individuals find the experience to largely be diminished by poor app performance, customer service and account management. Finding matches may also be more difficult due to the presence of bots and straight men trying to use the app in ways that stretch beyond its women-centric purpose.
Pros & ConsMany customization options for filtersKey features like adding friends, viewing profiles and starting chats are freeFriend feature allows users to make nonromantic connectionsRepetitive profile results even while swipingPossible bot activity seems apparent in likes, notifications and messagingNo desktop app available
Best Dating App For Bisexual People	Bindr
4.9
All ratings are determined solely by our editorial team.Monthly Subscription Cost: Prices start at $8.99 Free Version Available: Yes, with limited featuresAvailability: Android app, iOS app, desktopWho It’s For: Individuals who identify on the LGBTQ+ spectrum, with an emphasis on bisexual individualsPopular For: Individuals looking for a new, focused dating experience with fresh facesMatch System: Swiping system of curated matches, as well as browse/searchStandout Features: Bindr offers an orientation-free approach for those who feel they don’t fit a specific sexual orientation. It also offers community timelines and social feeds for those who want to get in touch with a larger community Why We Like BindrBindr is a relatively new addition to the LGBTQ+ dating app scene, making its debut in 2022 with the goal of creating a discrimination-free platform for bisexual individuals. We like that users don’t have to declare a sexual orientation. While hiding the orientation field is an option available on more established apps like Tinder, this app caters specifically to bisexuals and the broader LGBTQ+ community.Its paid options are fairly standard, but the ability to purchase a lifetime, 100-year premium package is a great choice for those who enjoy bonding with Bindr’s growing community. That said, because the app reportedly only has 150,000 users as of 2024, matching may be difficult in some geographic regions.Who Might Like Bindr:Individuals who are bisexual, pansexual or those with fluid sexual identitiesThose willing to try a new, emerging dating platformPeople who don’t want to be defined by a specific sexual orientationOur Experience with BindrOur two testers had a generally negative experience using Bindr, with both citing a lack of meaningful interaction as a central concern. One tester felt the experience improved when paid features were introduced.“It feels ineffective without premium and better suited for paid users.” — Hasnain (declined to provide demographic information)Testers found Bindr fairly easy to set up and appreciated the unique addition of a general chat room for larger group interaction. However, the experience was dogged by glitches such as match results ignoring sexual orientations, and poor in-app performance. It was also found that the app does not notify users when likes are reciprocated.Perhaps the biggest noted downside of using Bindr is the lack of meaningful conversation. Even with heavy messaging, it took nearly the entire two-week testing period to find one person willing to engage in genuine conversation. “My best conversation on the entire app was with the match who also shared with me that they felt there weren’t many actual people on Bindr looking for something real,” wrote Ashley in their testing journal.

Bindr is praised for its inclusive features, such as the ability to hide one’s sexual orientation, as well as the platform’s described policy against discriminatory behavior. However, technical bugs, a small user base and a restrictive free offering make this recently launched app a less viable option some some individuals.

Best Dating App For Gay Men	Hornet
4.8
All ratings are determined solely by our editorial team.Monthly Subscription Cost: Prices start at $16.49Free Version Available: Yes, with limited features Availability: Android app, iOS app, desktopWho It’s For: Gay, bisexual, transgender and queer menPopular For: All styles of gay relationshipsMatch System: Browse/searchStandout Features: Men seeking relationships can connect through text messages, audio messages, video chats and even livestreams all within the Hornet app. Users with popular livestreams can accrue a virtual currency called Honey Why We Like HornetWe appreciate Hornet as an inclusive and fairly popular dating app tailored to men seeking men. Touted as a community-oriented safe space centered on innovation, Hornet has 100 million users since launching in 2011, according to the company.One aspect of Hornet that we really like is the sheer number of communication options it offers right within the app. Video chat, audio messages and even livestreams can happen all within the same service. This goes beyond the message-only standard that many apps on this list have adopted. Not only does it cater to a specific sector of the LGBTQ+ community, but it gives that sector many different avenues to connect.Who Might Like Hornet:Men seeking menThose who are more familiar with social media than dating sitesMen in the LGBTQ+ community who are open to any relationship styleOur Experience with HornetOur platform tester appreciated Hornet’s unique yet familiar design but found that app usability suffered, especially while using its free plan.“Hornet has interesting social platform features, but technical glitches and a weak free plan are drawbacks.” — Hasnain (declined to provide demographic information)Hasnain found the Hornet experience to be unique, as its setup more closely resembles a social media feed than an ongoing scroll of swipes. Users can freely like and comment on the available feeds, though some feeds are restricted to premium members. Setting up a profile is free, but seeing who views or interacts with that profile requires a subscription.Our tester experienced an abundance of technical glitches, such as being unable to like or unlike posts and messages failing to delete after pressing the delete button. It was also noticed that inappropriate messages could be sent freely.On the other hand, paid features proved to be a meaningful addition. “Paid features play a crucial role in this app, as you can see who has liked and followed you. I got twice the number of activities done compared to free plans,” says Hasnain.	Consumer Sentiment Index

Hornet users tend to like this app for its intuitive interface design, photo-sharing features and the ability to connect with other men beyond a small local geographic area. Excessive ads and fake accounts make finding real matches a challenge, while intermittent technological crashes and long load times hamper the user experience.

The Best LGBTQ+ Dating App For Short-Term Relationships	Tinder
4.3
All ratings are determined solely by our editorial team.Monthly Subscription Cost: Prices start at $24.99Free Version Available: Yes, with limited featuresAvailability: Android app, iOS app, desktopWho It’s For: LGBTQ+ and straight individuals alike, with a large millennial user base Popular For: Casual relationshipsMatch System: Swiping system of curated matchesStandout Features: Tinder is a primarily heterosexual dating app that has features to serve the LGBTQ+ community. It allows users to select up to three different sexual orientations and ways to hide the orientation field if that’s preferred. The primary benefit of using Tinder is its massive install base that serves 50 million users per month, according to the company.
Why We Like TinderTinder is among the most popular dating apps in the U.S. For people living in more rural areas where social connection may be limited, tapping into that base of 50 million active users may be necessary. If that’s the case, Tinder has quite a few LGBTQ+-friendly features similar to other LGBTQ+ apps, such as the ability to hide a user’s sexual orientation. There’s also a built-in video chat feature for those willing to take conversations to the next level.Especially if you’re a millennial in search of a short-term fling, Tinder seems to be a smart choice for LGBTQ+ and heterosexual people alike. However, the app’s popularity may make bots and scammers more prevalent. If you’re skilled at checking for online dating red flags, Tinder may be a great service to consider when more niche apps fall through.Who Might Like Tinder:All individuals, with tailored options for the LGBTQ+ communityIndividuals looking for hookups and casual encountersThose who want or need a large user population to find a partnerOur Experience with TinderAcross four platform testers, Tinder was praised for its high volume of interactions, with some even finding its free features very usable. Despite that high volume, however, the low quality of individual conversations and occasional bot encounters remained a concern.“I had a positive experience with real interactions. Tinder has effective features even in the free version.” — Ashley (declined to provide demographic information)Tinder offered the most variable results on this ranking, with some testers engaging in meaningful conversations after just three days, while others didn’t see any meaningful activity at all for 10 days or more. Premium features undoubtedly helped increase profile visibility and engagement volume, but didn’t increase the amount of meaningful conversations. Those who struggled to interact on Tinder continued to do so, and those who enjoyed Tinder continued to perform well.“People match, but they don’t message, making the app feel pointless,” wrote one tester. While another said Tinder’s free daily Super Like offered “one of the quickest and nicest conversations I’ve had on the app so far.”	Consumer Sentiment Index

Tinder is among the most popular dating apps on the market, which may be its best feature, according to consumers. Beyond a wide dating pool, however, fake profiles, bots and scams remain an ongoing concern. As Tinder works to address these flaws, some users say their accounts have been banned or hidden from view without explanation. Users have said they also feel forced to pay for premium features to find success on the platform, and this downside is made all the more frustrating when problems with billing and customer service are also a common concern.
Pros & ConsEasy setup, according to our testerFree swipes and likes make connection easyPremium features genuinely improve visibilityAdvertisements for premium features can feel burdensomeMay be tough to find meaningful interactionsHigh premium price compared to other options in this ranking
How Do LGBTQ+ Dating Sites Work?
LGBTQ+ dating platforms aim to provide an online alternative to the romantic connections often made in clubs, bars and other in-person social scenarios.
Questionnaires and algorithms are central to LGBTQ+ dating sites. Users fill out basic information to create a profile that showcases their interests, looks and personality, and then those responses are often filtered into an algorithm that matches other users based on partial or exact responses. While many dating apps have a free version, users who pay for a subscription often have the option to communicate or connect with matches to begin a dialogue.
Hornet’s algorithm is based on using artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze massive amounts of data, including chat logs, posts and live video views, to generate potential matches based on details in the user’s profile. These features are only expected to expand in the coming months and years.
Tinder, on the other hand, reportedly bases its matching system with an algorithm based on the Elo System, a model originally used to match players in competitive chess tournaments. The formula was designed to match competitors based on their wins and losses to skilled players. For Tinder, a swipe right of approval counts as a win, and that win matters more to one’s algorithmic score if that swipe comes from someone who is deemed desirable based on their own number of swipes.
Risks of Online Dating For LGBTQ+ People
The risks of online dating for LGBTQ+ people largely mirror those that straight communities face, though orientation-specific risks may arise.
A 2020 survey by Pew Research Center suggests people in the lesbian, gay and bisexual communities are significantly more likely to experience the following threats compared to straight people:
Unwanted explicit messages
Unwanted continued contact
Offensive name-calling
Threats of physical harm[2]Brown A. Lesbian, gay and bisexual online daters report positive experiences – but also harassment. Pew Research Center. Accessed 5/14/2025.
“There are high rates of structural and interpersonal discrimination in our country that adversely affects individuals’ well-being here [in the U.S.], and that can have direct impact on relationship health along with the ability to seek peer support in dating, especially when [individuals’] local areas are less safe to do so,” explains Olivia Verhulst, L.M.H.C., a licensed psychotherapist and Forbes Health Advisory Board member.
Sometimes the results of this discrimination can be tragic. “Unfortunately, we have a lot of queer[phobia] and transphobia, and people have lost their lives,” adds Rufus Tony Spann, Ph.D., a nationally certified school psychologist, licensed professional counselor and Forbes Health Advisory Board member.

How To Stay Safe on LGBTQ+ Dating Sites and Apps
Given the increased potential for threatening behavior, Verhulst and Dr. Spann offer these tips to ensure safe online dating regardless of sexual orientation:
Be deliberate when providing personal information.
Stick to surface-level conversation at the start of a relationship to ensure personal information can’t be used against you in any way. Your profile should also exclude very detailed personal information.
Vet potential partners on social media.
Check potential matches’ Instagram, TikTok, X, LinkedIn or other social media profiles for signs of concerning behavior. Watch for threatening posts, and make sure the information you’re being given matches what’s on the profile.
Ask for a video chat.
Before meeting in person, always ask for a video chat to reduce the opportunity for catfishing. However, users—particularly those who are not tech-savvy—should also be aware of fake video chats that leverage AI as well. If the speaker doesn’t pause to hear your responses or seems to ignore what you’re saying, the video chat may be a prerecorded video made using AI.
Meet in a public place.
It’s always best to meet someone for the first time in a public place to reduce the potential for harmful situations. Bad behavior is less likely to happen in places where others can observe it.
Inform your friends.
Especially upon a first meeting, always let a family member or trusted friend know where you’ll be going and how long you anticipate being gone. If something deviates from the plan, your support system can quickly inform authorities.
