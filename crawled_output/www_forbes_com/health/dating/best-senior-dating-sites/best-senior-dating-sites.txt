Users were extremely disappointed with the dating service, OurTime because of the prevalence of fraudulent profiles and the inability to easily stop or cancel a subscription. The service itself appeared to put making a profit before providing its users with the ability to meet quality matches, and many users complained about technical difficulties and deficient customer support. Positive experiences were expressed by some users, who noted that they had met promising matches or located a platform that was in line with their demographic. However, the high amount of negative experiences with the service provided for a relatively poor overall take on the app.

It’s common for users who tried the dating platform SilverSingles to express negative sentiments, especially due to the lack of quality consumer support, regional compatibility issues and the existence of fraudulent accounts. Users noted difficulties, such as technical errors and the inability to access accounts, which contributed to frustrations with premium subscriptions. While the platform’s goal is to serve the older adult population, users were overall dissatisfied, citing deceitful practices, lack of proper support and a squandered financial expense.

User experiences with OkCupid are a mixed bag. Many individuals note irritation associated with high-cost membership charges, the frequency of fraudulent accounts and in-app glitches. Despite setting location preferences to nearby matches, users found that the platform tended to connect them with users from other countries. Users also cited deceitful movements made by the platform to encourage premium upgrades to additional services. Some users did appreciate the ability to message other users at no cost and the compatibility-based questionnaire; however, the lack of high-quality customer service, issues surrounding app performance and focus on making money, rather than creating a positive user experience, overshadowed any positive sentiments.

Methodology: How We Picked the Best Dating Sites for Seniors of 2025
To determine the best dating apps and websites for older adults for 2025, the Forbes Health editorial team analyzed data for online dating platforms available via the iOS and Google Play stores, as well as desktop websites, combing over a variety of metrics that we determined to be most important to consumers.
To evaluate each dating platform, our team of editors and researchers independently collected data on a variety of metrics, including subscription fees, features available on the app, communication methods, user ratings, safety features and more. Forbes Health also conducted a survey of 1,600 dating app users and commissioned six dating platform testers to try our top platforms for two weeks. Survey data and tester feedback were incorporated into our final ranking. Star ratings were then determined solely by the editorial team.
Specifically, Forbes Health examined the following metrics:
Consumer survey data (NPS): 25%
General app features, such as intake questionnaire, match filtering, profile boosting options, communication features and defining relationship goals: 15%
Cost: 15%
Consumer Sentiment Index (CSI): 12.5%
Whether it specifically caters to seniors: 10%
Whether primary features are available without subscription: 10%
Safety features, including photo verification and profile blocking: 7.5%
Whether a desktop website is available: 2.5%
Hands-on tester rating: 2.5%

How Do Dating Sites for Older Adults Work?
“Most older adults report that their social support network shrinks as they get older, however, with dating, they are able to grow, learn about themselves and experience a new journey,” says Sabrina Romanoff, Psy.D., a Harvard-trained clinical psychologist, professor, researcher and Forbes Health Advisory Board member.
Dating sites for older adults are often marketed toward specific age ranges, like ages 50 and up, for example. The sign-up process may start with the user completing an initial personality test or questionnaire to fuel the platform’s algorithm, which will identify a person’s future matches. Additional factors like location, lifestyle preferences and partnership goals may also determine which profiles the platform sends your way. You will typically then be able to customize your profile with photos and information about yourself, as well as browse and like other users’ profiles. If you match with another user, you can start a conversation with them, potentially leading to a date.
Are Dating Sites for Older Adults Safe?
Being a member of a dating app or site can pose potential risks for users of any age. Online dating sites for older adults can be safe—when the right precautions are taken.
“Prioritize safety by sticking to well-known platforms with identity verification,” says Judy Ho, Ph.D., a triple board-certified and licensed clinical and forensic neuropsychologist and Forbes Health Advisory Board member. “Don’t share personal information—like your home address or financial details—early on. Always meet in public places and tell at least one trusted friend or family member where you’ll be.”
It’s also important to be aware of the potential risk of being exposed to online scams on online dating apps and sites.
“This can be quite common, and scammers take advantage of people who are expressing loneliness or other emotional vulnerabilities,” says Dr. Ho. “This is why it’s so important to tell a trusted family member or friend that you are using online apps and bounce ideas off of them regarding judgment, questions asked by a new contact and to see if there are any red flags,” she says, adding that it’s wise to “use a good app that guards against scams/catfishing and offers reporting tools if you notice a scammer.”
Dr. Ho adds that if something doesn’t feel quite right, it probably isn’t, and urges anyone who is dating online to trust their instincts. Before going on a date, make sure you have a way to exit the situation quickly and safely if needed, such as a ready-made excuse to cut the date short or by having a friend you can reach during the date in case things go awry. These precautions can help you feel relaxed and comfortable while on your date, adds Dr. Ho.
Features to Look For in Dating Sites for Older Adults
Dating site and app features can vary based on your chosen platform and whether you have a free or premium version. Premium features may include unlimited messaging, increased profile visibility (increases your profile’s exposure to more users) and added ability to customize search filters when seeking out a match. Free versions typically offer fewer features.
Dr. Ho suggests looking for features like an age-appropriate user base, a simple and intuitive user interface, personality-based matching algorithms, user verification and security features (including profile verification and/or encryption to guard against scams and catfishing) and privacy controls.

Expert Tips for Successful Online Dating as an Older Adult
Tips for safe and successful dating as an older adult, according to Dr. Ho and Dr. Romanoff, include:
Select a platform aligned with your goals.
“Choose apps specifically designed for your age group, as they’re typically more aligned with your values and goals,” says Dr. Ho. “Also, be clear in your profile about what you’re looking for, and take your time getting to know someone before meeting in person.”
Reflect on your values.
“It can be intimidating to reenter the dating world, especially after loss or a long-term relationship,” notes Dr. Ho. “You may also compare your dating partners to your past loves and experience some decision paralysis.” If self-questioning comes up, reassess why you’re dating, what you’re specifically seeking and keep an open mind.
Go at your own pace.
Dr. Romanoff urges those looking to dive into online dating to be patient and open to new experiences, which may require a bit of trial and error. “Ultimately, it’s important not to overshare and take it slow, be positive and embrace all the highs and lows that might come with these new experiences,” she adds.
Ultimately, with the right platform and a quality understanding of oneself and what you’re looking for in a potential match, online dating can be extremely rewarding. “The promise of having a built-in partner to explore the world, face adventures and have a hand to hold through the difficult moments can make dating as an older adult worthwhile,” says Dr. Romanoff.

What are the benefits of dating as an older adult?
Dating as an older adult has many advantages. “There are lots of benefits,” says Dr. Ho. “Meaningful social connection is a major protective factor for both physical and mental health, especially as we age. Dating can reduce feelings of loneliness and isolation, boost self-esteem and even improve cognitive health.”
“[Another] one of the biggest advantages is emotional maturity—you’re more likely to know what you want and need in a relationship [at an older age],” says Dr. Ho. “There’s also often less pressure to conform to social timelines (e.g., marriage, children), allowing you to take relationships at your pace,” she adds.
