Commissions we earn from partner links on this page do not affect our opinions or evaluations. Our editorial content is based on thorough research and guidance from the Forbes Health Advisory Board.
While online therapy offers an accessible outlet for those looking to address mental health concerns from home, online psychiatry may provide a more suitable solution for those in need of advanced care. Especially when medication is necessary, assistance from a psychiatrist may offer the best avenue for treatment.
To determine the best online psychiatry services, the Forbes Health editorial team analyzed 19 providers based on more than a dozen data points, including cost, insurance coverage, medication offerings, specialized ADHD care and more. Internal testers were also used to personally verify each platform’s core competencies over the course of real-life therapy sessions.
Note: Prices are based on the lowest option available, are accurate as of publication and are subject to change.

Best Online Psychiatry Services of 2025
Cerebral
5.0
All ratings are determined solely by our editorial team.Cost: $180 every three months (medication only), $365 per month (medication and therapy) Services available: Medication management, individual therapy, couples therapyTherapy formats: Video or phone (where permitted) with messaging in between sessionsSession length: Approximately 45-minute sessionsProviders in network: 350 active providers in networkAccepts insurance: Accepts insurance but does not accept Medicare 	Learn More	On Cerebral's Website Why We Chose CerebralFor those who prefer a subscription model, Cerebral positions itself as a great option for online psychiatry services. Perhaps its best feature is its in-house CerebralRX virtual pharmacy that keeps appointments and critical medications under one roof. As a bonus, the delivery of medication through CerebralRX is free.The personal nature of the platform makes it worth trying, as users can select and change their provider with ease. There are also specialized providers on hand for those confronting concerns related to LGBTQ+ issues, ADHD and more. Cerebral is a functional and inclusive platform that expertly unifies mental health needs.Our Experience with CerebralWhen trying out Cerebral for online therapy, our tester, Dave, had a generally positive experience with the platform. In particular, its interface, effective reminder system and skilled therapist were highlighted as major strengths. Dave experienced cerebral through a 45-minute video call and had a relatively favorable experience. Signup was seamless, taking just 10 minutes to complete. From there, he was able to choose the type of plan that worked best for him, which included psychiatry.Dave liked that, in contrast to some other platforms, Cerebral offered a list of providers to choose from and clearly displayed their qualifications, giving him agency over this important choice.The session itself was successful. Dave, described the therapist as “prepared” and able to offer a more personalized and thorough intake session than similar platforms.“If the monthly subscription model works for you, this is an excellent service.” — Dave, Cerebral Tester	Consumer Sentiment Index

Users appreciate Cerebral for its helpful practitioners and accessible appointments that are simple to schedule. These positives, however, are offset by frequent issues with billing, lackluster transparency and poor customer service. These negative experiences fuel a broader perception of Cerebral as a business that cares more about profit than its customers. A 2024 data breach settlement also raises concerns among users about the company’s privacy standards.

Sesame Care
4.8
All ratings are determined solely by our editorial team.Cost: $79 per month (Mental Health RX subscription); individual sessions also offered at varied prices Services available: Online therapy, online psychiatry, medication managementTherapy formats: Live video with optional messaging between sessions, select providers also offer in-person sessionsSession length: 30-50 minute sessions, though length may vary by providerProviders in network: 10,000 active providers in networkAccepts insurance: Does not accept insurance or Medicare	Learn More	On Sesame Care's Website Why We Chose Sesame CareWhile some services only offer online psychiatry services via a subscription, Sesame Health is perhaps the most open platform in this ranking when it comes to allowing users to choose a payment structure that works for them. The service’s $79 Mental Health RX monthly subscription is quite affordable compared to the competition, but those who don’t want an ongoing commitment can instead opt to purchase sessions individually. Users may even find psychiatrists who have in-person sessions available to book, which could be helpful in crisis scenarios. On the medication front, Sesame Health doesn’t have its own bespoke pharmacy to fill prescriptions, but it will send them locally.People hoping to use insurance won’t find that support with Sesame Health, as the provider doesn’t accept insurance or Medicare. Luckily, users can see which providers are available in their area before signing up and committing money to the service.Our Experience with Sesame CareOur tester, Megan, had a very positive experience using Sesame Health to sign up for a therapy session with a new provider. Everything from account creation to therapist selection went smoothly, and the therapist came prepared with personalized questions based on intake information.“[I liked] the ease of the app, the knowledge of the therapists, the super-fast appointment times [and] the smooth intake process” – Megan, Sesame Health TesterIn particular, Megan liked that Sesame put available providers front and center, allowing users to select their source of care before the sign-up process even begins. She could also filter providers based on certain criteria, such as gender, if needed. When her appointment time arrived, Megan was prompted by email, text and in-app notifications. When issues arose, customer service responded to concerns in less than one hour.The only downside Megan noted was that provider availability seemed to depend greatly on her physical location. However, for those in a large metropolitan area or one in which Sesame has a decent selection, the platform remains a viable option.	Consumer Sentiment Index

Consumers generally have a mixed opinion on Sesame Care. While users appreciate the service for its convenience, reasonable pricing and professional practitioners, there are ongoing concerns about customer service, billing and difficulty in receiving refunds. Perhaps most relevant to psychiatry are reported issues in the handling of prescriptions.

Doctor On Demand
3.9
All ratings are determined solely by our editorial team.Cost: $299+ for initial consultation and $129 per follow-up visit Services available: Online therapy, couples therapy, online psychiatry, medication managementTherapy formats: Video and audio sessions through app, limited messagingSession length: 45-minute consultations, 15-minute follow-up appointmentsProviders in network: Not disclosedAccepts insurance: Accepts insurance and Medicare Why We Chose Doctor On DemandAs an intuitive telehealth platform with an online psychiatry option, Doctor On Demand is a solid option to consider. Its prescription services offer some great benefits like free delivery and automatic refills, making it a worthwhile selection for psychiatry. The available specialties, such as for ADHD and OCD, provide much-needed representation for specific groups.Doctor On Demand also fares well by some basic review metrics. Sporting a 4.9-star rating on the App Store and a 4.7-star rating on Google Play means many customers have a positive experience when using this app. The A+ Better Business Bureau rating further solidifies Doctor on Demand as a platform for consideration. Our Experience with Doctor On DemandOur tester, Megan, had a broadly negative experience while trying Doctor On Demand for an online therapy session. While video chat and the platform functioned well, scheduling glitches, limited provider selection and a poor interaction with the provider hampered the experience.“My therapist was not prepared. We had a very informal conversation that honestly didn’t address my issue and the reason I wanted therapy.” – Megan, Doctor On Demand TesterEven though onboarding was fairly simple, our tester left feeling less than impressed. She didn’t appreciate ads that attempted to upsell her on various unrelated services, such as cold and flu treatment. She also felt that provider selection was lacking, and, while specialty filters were present, they weren’t as robust as they could be for the neurodiverse community, in particular.Her 50-minute video call started late because the therapist was not in the room. When they did arrive, Megan felt the discussion was too unprofessional to be helpful. When Megan finished her session, she also encountered a technical glitch in which the option to schedule her next visit disappeared from the interface. This was ultimately fixed by customer service, although the staff took several hours to resolve the problem.	Consumer Sentiment Index

It has a large network of providers and a substantial insurance network that should give customers plenty of options to consider. It helps that the platform makes switching providers quick and easy.In addition to basic psychiatry, we appreciate that this platform puts its psychiatry-plus-therapy plan front and center, given how well the two services complement one another. The Teen Care specialty is a fantastic concept, and one we’ve not often seen in our analyses. Our Experience with Brightside HealthWhile testing Brightside Health’s therapy offering, our tester, Meaghan, appreciated the platform for its insightful therapy session and unique tracking tools. Meaghan expressed disappointment at the lack of a refund for subscribers once they start the service.“My provider was very proactive and goal-oriented while simultaneously listening, reflecting and offering advice and guidance.” – Meaghan, Brightside Health TesterAfter trying a Brightside therapy session on a laptop, Meaghan generally found it offered a solid user experience. Provider selection was simple, though she would have preferred the option to filter available providers based on specialty as opposed to availability. At the very least, bios for matched providers added a level of personal touch.In advance of her session, Meaghan received multiple notifications, and the provider was prepared as soon as the appointment time arrived. The video conference platform also operated without issue for the full 45 minutes. Actionable mental health insights were gained even during the introductory session.To find out more, read our full Brightside Health review.	Consumer Sentiment Index

Users of Brightside Health appreciate the platform for its caring providers, some of which have facilitated meaningful life improvements. These positives, however, are also surrounded by reports of billing frustrations, poor customer service and general challenges in trying to access care. While our tester didn’t notice any specific technical flaws, other customers have.

With a huge network of 5,000 providers to its name, there’s opportunity for customers to find the psychiatry or therapy services that work best for them. While the company could provide greater clarity on its precise number of accepted insurers, some of the more popular insurers are specifically highlighted for inclusion.One area where Talkspace stands slightly above the rest is its front-facing inclusive messaging. There are a fair number of providers that outline their commitments to the LGBTQ+ population and other crucial communities, but Talkspace is among the first we’ve seen to specifically highlight specialized mental health services for military members and seniors, two groups that are especially prone to unique struggles. Our Experience with TalkspaceTalkspace therapy yielded a favorable outcome in Forbes Health user testing. The provider, customer support and the core technical facets of the platform performed at or above expectations without major issues.“The therapist was professional, communicative and asked the right questions about me. I’d definitely continue the therapy session with her.” – Jonny, Talkspace TesterGetting started on Talkspace was seamless for Jonny, with basic account creation steps taking less than three minutes. The provider selection process lacked some transparency, given that users are instantly matched with a provider. It is possible to change and receive a new match even before seeing that first provider, but Jonny felt the method for doing so wasn’t as intuitive as it could be.In the session, the therapist was warm and caring. The same can be said of Talkspace’s customer support, which promptly offered a refund when asked.	Consumer Sentiment Index

Methodology: How We Picked the Best Online Psychiatry Services of 2025
To determine the best online psychiatry platforms of 2025, the Forbes Health editorial team distributed an in-depth survey to 43 online mental health providers with questions about their services. Those questions covered appointment costs, insurance acceptance, size of provider network and more. The Forbes Health editorial team also independently collected data on more than 35 metrics to determine its best online psychiatry ranking. Extra points were awarded to companies that were transparent and provided information about their services via the aforementioned survey.
All of our online therapy rankings take into account a general score that features the same methodology for all rankings (35%), a score specific to the use case we are analyzing for that specific ranking (55%) and a survey completion score (10%).

Privacy, including session privacy and third-party data sharing protocols: 10%

Mobile app availability and number of reviews, along with the average review rating: 9%
Average third-party ratings, including ones from the Better Business Bureau and Trustpilot: 12%
Meanwhile, this specific ranking also takes into account the following methodology:

Cost of follow-up appointments or monthly subscription: 10%
Consumer Sentiment Index scores: 10%

What Is Online Psychiatry?
Psychiatry is defined as “the branch of medicine focused on the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of mental, emotional and behavioral disorders,” according to the American Psychiatric Association.
“In psychiatry, the focus is on the biological aspects of mental health and the medical model, with the goal to diagnose a mental health disorder and prescribe medication as a form of treatment,” explains Ashwini Nadkarni, M.D., a board-certified psychiatrist, assistant professor at Harvard Medical School and a Forbes Health Advisory Board member.
Online psychiatry, specifically, offers a virtual means of mental health and behavioral treatment that often involves a clinical diagnosis, the use of medication and/or therapy and advanced interventional techniques that may progress beyond traditional emphasis areas of talk therapy, such as ketamine therapy or electroconvulsive therapy.
What’s the Difference Between Psychotherapy and Psychiatry?
While psychiatry and psychotherapy are critical tools to aid one’s mental health and well-being, experts suggest they take different, and often complementary, paths to doing so.
“Oftentimes in psychotherapy, people explore their emotions, behaviors and thought patterns, finding ways to better understand themselves, as well as improve their communication and interpersonal relationships,” explains Brook Choulet, M.D., a board-certified concierge psychiatrist and Forbes Health Advisory Board member. “Psychiatrists are medical doctors that complete medical school and are trained to diagnose, treat and manage mental health conditions through a combination of medication and [sometimes, as appropriate, briefer sessions of] psychotherapy.”
“Therapy, also known as psychotherapy, involves conversations [or skills-based training sessions] with a skilled psychotherapist to address psychological distress, areas of life where the patient feels stuck, [such as] relationship challenges and career development,” adds Ziv Cohen, M.D., a board-certified psychiatrist, clinical assistant professor of psychiatry at Weill Cornell Medicine and a Forbes Health Advisory Board member. While most psychotherapists don’t focus on medication treatment, they may still be a masters-level or doctoral-level clinician.
Individuals seeking medication treatment may be best served by a psychiatrist (or in some cases, a licensed psychologist who is approved to prescribe medication in certain states). Those who would like to learn non-medicinal strategies to manage and treat their symptoms may be best served by a psychotherapist. Many individuals utilize both types of services (medication treatment and psychotherapy) in order to enhance their progress and self-understanding.
Mental Health Is Personal. So Is Talkiatry's Approach To Psychiatry.
Answer a few questions, match with a psychiatrist, and start collaborating on your care with your doctor.

On Talkiatry's Website
What To Look For in an Online Psychiatrist
Given the sensitive needs online psychiatrists often serve, those interested in seeing one should ensure their chosen provider holds the proper qualifications. According to Dr. Choulet, these four aspects deserve the utmost attention:
Credentials and licensure.
Ensure the psychiatrist is board-certified by the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology or by the National Board of Physicians and Surgeons. Next, confirm the provider has an active license in your state.
Specialization.
Many psychiatrists specialize in certain areas such as child and adolescent psychiatry, ADHD, sports psychiatry and more. Choose a psychiatrist with a specialization that best serves your needs.
Treatment approach.
Ensure the psychiatrist you select, and their approach, aligns with your preferences for your care. It can be helpful to confirm they take a collaborative approach to treating their patients.
Telehealth platform security.
Lastly, confirm the platform your psychiatrist uses is HIPAA-compliant and offers secure communication.
Additionally, Dr. Cohen suggests that, even for those seeking treatment online, it may be helpful to know if your chosen provider offers in-person office hours. ”Taking these steps can help ensure you receive high-quality, personalized mental health care that best supports your well-being,” he says.
Does Medicare or Insurance Cover Online Psychiatry?
Medicare Part B covers online psychiatry care and evaluation. As is true in most cases, Medicare covers 80% of the treatment cost, with the other 20% covered by additional insurance or the individual. Medication therapy management services are most often covered under a Medicare Part D prescription drug plan. Brightside Health is the only service on this ranking to accept Medicare.
Many of the online psychiatry services featured in this ranking accept private insurance, including Cerebral, Brightside Health and Teladoc Health. Individuals should always check with their desired provider beforehand to confirm insurance coverage.
Do Online Psychiatrists Prescribe Medication?
Most online psychiatry platforms offer care from medical professionals who can prescribe medications such as Paxil, Prozac or Lexapro to qualifying individuals as part of their treatment plan. However, many providers aren’t authorized to prescribe controlled substances, which include opioids, benzodiazepines and stimulants. If seeking ADHD care and in need of Ritalin, for example, only a platform able to prescribe controlled substances can prescribe it for you. None of the online psychiatry platforms on this ranking are able to prescribe controlled substances at this time.
How Online Psychiatry May Change in 2026
Online psychiatry may change considerably in 2026, as restrictions from the Ryan Haight Online Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act of 2008, often called the Ryan Haight Act, are reinstated in a post-COVID world. On January 31, 2020, at the start of the coronavirus pandemic, restrictions were lifted to allow authorized providers to prescribe controlled substances via telemedicine, without the need for an in-person visit. This ruling remains in effect through 2025, but it’s subject to change in 2026.
“As these temporary rules are reversed, many providers will once again need to see patients in person at least once before prescribing controlled substances,” explains Dr. Cohen. “Patients who rely on ADHD medications, anxiety medications or sleep aids may need to schedule an in-person visit before receiving prescriptions,” he says. In theory, the small number of online psychiatry platforms that do offer controlled substances may not be able to do so at all.
“Hybrid models [that combine in-person and virtual visits] may become more common,” suggests Dr. Cohen. “In general, a recent trend has been increased demand for in-person evaluations. Over the coming year, this trend will likely continue, while there continues to be strong demand for online appointments as well,” he says.
While it’s possible COVID-era prescription models will continue into 2026 and beyond, the current extension is set to expire on December 31, 2025.
Even though many online psychiatry platforms don’t currently prescribe the controlled substances that could be impacted by these changes, individuals who are prescribed controlled substances through telemedicine should watch this development closely and any possible extensions of the COVID-era rule.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
Are online psychiatrists legit?
Online psychiatry platforms that offer services with licensed psychiatrists, like those featured in this ranking, provide a legitimate and effective form of mental health care. In addition to licensure, care should also be taken to inquire about data privacy and HIPAA compliance of the platform.
What does a psychiatrist treat?
Dr. Nadkarni describes psychiatry as the treatment of individuals with impairment of functioning and mental health conditions. The conditions psychiatrists can treat include (but are not limited to):
Depression
Anxiety
Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
Bipolar disorder
Schizophrenia
Phobias
Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)
Personality disorders
While not always the case, treatment for these conditions may involve medications like antidepressants or antipsychotics, such as sedatives.
Is online psychiatry as effective as in-person psychiatry?
For many people, online psychiatry can be an effective form of treatment for certain mental health concerns. However, those who require a focus on nonverbal cues, feel rapport develops better in person, or those who may be more prone to distraction or self-harm, may see greater benefit from and be best treated through in-person care.
Do I need a referral for an online psychiatrist?
Many online psychiatric platforms do not require a referral to use their services. However, your insurance coverage may require a referral, so check with your provider, first.
Can you get anxiety medication online?
Licensed psychiatrists who practice telepsychiatry are able to prescribe medication, including anti-anxiety medication, virtually.
Who is online psychiatry good for?
Psychiatry may be a positive development when livelihoods become impaired by mental health conditions such as anxiety, depression or schizophrenia.
Online psychiatry can be a huge benefit to people who face accessibility challenges that make it difficult to attend regular appointments. It’s also helpful that people who feel a sense of stigma about receiving mental health care have an outlet to do so in the privacy of their own home.
As convenient as online psychiatry platforms may be, however, they’re less advised when treating mental health conditions in which crisis care is required. Online psychiatry may also falter when treating conditions that necessitate reading non-verbal cues. Online psychiatry, then, is perhaps best for those who want psychiatric care but don’t need complex assistance to address their concerns.
Can you be diagnosed by a psychiatrist online?
Yes. Many online psychiatry platforms, such as Cerebral, Brightside Health and others in this ranking, offer the opportunity to receive a clinical diagnosis online.
