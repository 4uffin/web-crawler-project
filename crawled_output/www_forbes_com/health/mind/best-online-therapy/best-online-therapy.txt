One out of two people worldwide will develop a mental health disorder during their lifetime, according to a large-scale study in The Lancet Psychiatry led by Harvard Medical School and the University of Queensland[1]Half of World’s Population Will Experience a Mental Health Disorder. Harvard Medical School. Accessed 6/10/2025. . With such a high prevalence of mental health conditions, online therapy platforms can make mental health care more accessible to individuals seeking support.
To determine the best online therapy options of 2025, Forbes Health analyzed 27 platforms across the market, factoring in 24 data points, such as cost, session length, insurance eligibility and other metrics. Additionally, Forbes Health worked with testers who tried every platform, gathering first-person insights on each platform’s quality of therapists and care. Here are our top picks for the best online therapy services in 2025.
Note: This ranking represents therapy and psychologist visits only—psychiatry and medication management services may be available on some platforms as a separate service or for an additional cost.

Talkspace offers therapy for a variety of clients, including individuals, teens ages 13 through 17 and couples. Individuals in need of psychiatry services, including medication management, can also utilize Talkspace.Our Experience with TalkspaceOverall, our platform tester, Jonny, said Talkspace had a simple sign-up process, and he appreciated the short video introductions each provider offered. However, he noted potential areas of improvement in the therapist selection process, such as offering clients a list of providers to choose from ahead of making a selection. He had a positive experience with the therapist he spoke to.“The therapist was warm and approachable, and her genuine, nonjudgmental manner made me feel comfortable. That sense of sincerity really motivated me to keep going.”Jonny completed a 30-minute live video session from his computer. He found account creation to be easy, which included an initial questionnaire.“It was efficient and quick (took less than 3 minutes to fill everything in), but there seems to be different pricing on the payment options page depending on where you are located (likely) or what issue you want solving,” explains Jonny.He was assigned a therapist automatically. “I assumed I’d be able to choose from several profiles, but that option wasn’t obvious up front,” he says. Jonny rotated through five different therapists before he was able to find a next-day opening. “The UI (user interface) was easy to navigate, and the email reminders for the session I had were useful so I wouldn’t miss the session itself. I liked the ability to be able to message the provider/therapist directly from the website.”— Jonny, platform tester	Consumer Sentiment Indexing for Talkspace

Users described mostly poor experiences with Talkspace. Factors that contributed to this widespread dissatisfaction included its billing operations, consumer support and app serviceability. A large number of users encountered unforeseen charges and insurance coverage problems, as well as trouble reaching out to customer service for technical assistance or refunds. Users noted positive experiences with the quality therapists and the convenience of meeting with a provider virtually. However, these sentiments are widely surpassed by the lack of reliability of the platform and disappointment with its practices as a company.

Best Therapist Availability	Amwell
5.0
Our ratings take into account price, clarity of service options and rules, insurance acceptance, the availability of live video sessions and other attributes. All ratings are determined solely by our editorial team.Cost: $99 or less per video therapy sessionTherapy services available: Individual therapy, couples therapyTherapy formats: Live videoSession length: 45 minutesProviders in network: 350+ active providers in network Insurance Availability: Accepts 40 insurance providers and some Medicare plans Offers Psychiatry/Medication Services: Yes Why We Chose AmwellAs an online therapy provider Amwell shines for its acceptance of 40 insurance providers, more than many of the platforms on our ranking. Its network features providers who hold a master’s or doctorate-level license and have a minimum of two years of professional experience post-licensure. While Amwell may not have all the bells and whistles other platforms on this ranking offer (it does not have text therapy, for example), its services are straightforward, with users billed per session, and offers the convenience of being able to select your own therapist along with appointment availability on nights and weekends.Our Experience with AmwellOur platform tester, Miguel, found Amwell easy to navigate and making an appointment simple. He didn’t experience any technical issues. However, he felt his therapist came to the session unprepared.Miguel completed a 30-minute video session with Amwell. He found the set-up simple, involving an initial questionnaire which helped match him with a therapist. “The process is pretty quick. I registered with only an email account. No social security or additional documents are required. I took a questionnaire before my appointment. The questionnaire was brief and took 10 minutes to complete,” says Miguel. He was able to browse a list of potential therapists and choose one himself. He felt there were plenty of options, noting that most providers were women and had available appointments in the morning.“My therapist was very open. I was given plenty of time to disclose medical information. There [were] no connection or audio issues. The video call ran smoothly. I accessed the call via a portal on my Amwell account. I had to double check if my mic and camera were working.”He did, however, feel like his therapist was unprepared for the session. “The therapist performed like I was food on a conveyor belt. She seemed a little tired when I logged into the appointment. I felt like I was answering a survey. The therapist sounded like she wanted to wrap up the appointment in less than 30 minutes. The only positive thing is she was very patient whenever I stuttered,” notes Miguel.– Miguel, platform tester	Consumer Sentiment Indexing for Amwell

Users cited both negative and positive experiences with Amwell, with some individuals promoting the platform and others expressing dissatisfaction. On the positive side, users praised the short consultations, ease of accessing the platform and scheduling sessions, and professionalism from their providers. Users also applaud the service for providing a user-friendly solution for virtual mental health care. When it comes to negative sentiments, users were disappointed with the platform’s low-quality consumer support, problematic billing practices and repeated technical glitches. Some also found the care received from their provider to be poor—mainly due to issues communicating with the experts and managing medication. With these sentiments in mind, users cite an overall moderate experience with the platform, with some likely to promote it and others dissatisfied with the hurdles faced while using it.

All of its providers are licensed and experienced psychologists, marriage and family therapists, clinical social workers or licensed professional counselors. Where BetterHelp may fall short, however, is that it doesn’t accept insurance, potentially making the platform inaccessible to some individuals seeking mental health support. Still, $280 per month for four video therapy sessions comes out to $70 per session, a competitive rate for online therapy.In March of 2023, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued a proposed order to ban BetterHelp from sharing consumer data with third-party advertisers, such as Facebook and Snapchat, including sensitive information about mental health and health data. To settle these charges, the order also called on the company to pay $7.8 million to consumers. In May 2024, BetterHelp agreed to pay the $7.8 million, notifying approximately 800,000 customers of refund eligibility. Refund payments began going out in June of 2024 and remain ongoing as of April 2025.At the time of publishing, BetterHelp has also recently been accused of its providers using artificial intelligence (AI) in communication with its clients. While it appears this situation is ongoing, a report from Blue Orca Capital includes accounts from multiple “whistleblower” clients who claim BetterHelp providers used AI in live chat and messaging during online therapy care via the platform.Our Experience with BetterHelpOur platform tester, Carley, had an overall positive experience using BetterHelp. While the registration process was a bit in-depth, it connected her to a therapist well-matched to her needs. However, the therapist didn’t have availability until over a week after initial registration, and toward the end of the appointment, she felt the therapist took over the conversation.“I noticed that when I logged onto the platform for the session, [the therapist] had messaged me two days before asking if we could move it, which I didn’t see until it was too late. She still ended up being online for me, but explained that she had a friend in town who she doesn’t get to see often. That made me feel a little bad at the start, but it wasn’t really a big deal. I thought she was very kind and had good insight for my situation.”Carley found the initial questionnaire to be somewhat long. “It was simple but lengthy. It asked a lot of in-depth questions that either required one answer or allowed multiple boxes to be checked as a response, and sometimes it was hard to make a decision as to what response was right for me in some areas (as I can be a bit indecisive),” she explains. While Carley had an overall pleasant experience, she felt that she was unable to speak her mind later in the session. ”I think my only con of the whole experience was that later in the session, it got to be mostly the therapist talking and me nodding and listening. I really liked her actually, but I would’ve liked her to look for a little further insight into my background and who I am. However, I get that with the first session, she was just making sure she had some takeaways and techniques to leave me with.”– Carley, platform tester	Consumer Sentiment Indexing for BetterHelp

On the other hand, some users are dissatisfied with the costs of the service, inability to have their sessions covered by insurance, security concerns and questionable provider qualifications.

Many users have something to say about Teladoc Health, and their opinions are mostly poor. Feedback commonly notes refund and charge errors, low-quality or too-short consultations, low-quality services and the inability to get an accurate diagnosis or medication management. While some users commend the platform’s ease of use, timeliness and affordable cost, concerns remain surrounding the inability to contact customer service, as well as the perception that the platform’s largely monetary focus outweighs the user’s experience on the platform.

Best for Crisis Care	Brightside Health

All ratings are determined solely by our editorial team.Cost: $299 per month for four video therapy sessions Therapy services available: Individual, psychiatry, crisis care, teen careTherapy formats: Anytime messaging, live videoSession length: 45 minutesProviders in network: Not disclosed in 2025Insurance availability: Private insurance and MedicareOffers Psychiatry/Medication Services: Yes	Learn More	On Brightside's Website Why We Chose Brightside HealthFor its online therapy offering, Brightside charges $299 per month, which encompasses four monthly video therapy sessions, or $74.75 per session—a lower rate compared to some other online providers on this list. The platform notes that its therapists hold at least a master’s or doctoral degree in clinical psychology, clinical social work or counseling from an accredited program. Brightside accepts 30 insurance providers, as well as Medicare and Medicaid. With therapists available in all 50 states, this is an accessible online therapy provider for a variety of mental health conditions, from mild anxiety to more specialized care. It also offers an arsenal of tools to help support individuals in between sessions, including progress trackers, audio lessons and practice exercises.Our Experience with Brightside Health Overall, our platform tester, Meaghan, was pleased with her experience. She did not face any technical difficulties, and video quality during her session was solid. While her session was largely an intake appointment, she appreciated the engagement she had with her provider.“The conversation was fluid, organic and insightful, and I thought my provider asked interesting, pertinent questions to better understand what I was hoping to achieve through therapy.”Meaghan completed a 45-minute video call with a provider from Brightside Health. She was able to choose from a list of therapists, which were organized by availability rather than suitability.“I thought it was interesting that therapist selection was automatically generated based on the calendar rather than my being able to read through bios, then view a specific clinician’s schedule availability. However, when the therapist was populated, I was able to read their bio before scheduling,” explains Meaghan.During the session, our tester noted that the provider was in athletic attire, which may come off as unprofessional to some. “Personally, I was unbothered by the therapist’s casual attire, as our session went well, and they offered very professional insights that demonstrated their education, experience and skills.”– Meaghan, platform tester	Consumer Sentiment Indexing for Brightside Health

It may be particularly convenient for those looking for prescription medication management along with talk therapy, given bundled treatment plans. If you need a prescription, the platform can mail it straight to your home for privacy and convenience via CerebralRx. Cerebral offers a range of therapy modalities, including cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR).Our Experience with CerebralOverall, our platform tester, Dave, found the set-up process to be fairly simple; however, the number of therapists in his state and their appointment availability felt limited.“The lack of options stands out. With there only being one therapist available, it seems I was assigned to her just for the sake of it. I had no option to indicate preferences as to gender, race, experience, specialization etc. I didn’t select a therapist; I had the only available person assigned to me.”Dave completed a video session with Cerebral and described the experience as fairly basic.“One multiple-choice question on why I wanted a therapist, and that was it. There was only one therapist available for Massachusetts and [my selected topic of] ‘work stress,’ so I didn’t get the option of looking at therapists’ profiles or selecting anyone. No information [was available] on cancelling the subscription if I later changed my mind,” says Dave. He also noted that while his job is flexible, appointment times on Cerebral were only during the typical workday.– Dave, platform tester	Consumer Sentiment Indexing for Cerebral

It offers a monthly subscription for either text therapy, live video sessions or a combination of both. Calmerry’s network features licensed clinical psychologists, marriage and family therapists, clinical social workers and licensed professional counselors who hold either a master’s or doctorate degree and have at least one year of experience. For those who prefer a clear path of goals and action items, Calmerry may be a good fit—the platform provides a therapy plan with treatment goals, action items and milestones.Our Experience with CalmerryOur platform tester, Jon, found signing up for the platform to be simple. However, he would have preferred a trial or less commitment than signing up for a subscription. Jon also did not have a positive experience during his session, citing communication issues and a lack of preparation on the provider’s part.“On the downside, there is no ability to trial the service or to explore therapists or the resources on offer prior to signing up; instead, you have to lock in for a monthly subscription…”Jon completed a 30-minute video session with Calmerry. He found the onboarding process to be fairly simple and straightforward, requiring a short questionnaire about current circumstances and medical history. “It was easy, and my account was set up in minutes,” says Jon.However, Jon was unable to switch his therapists despite his best attempt and did not have the most positive experience during his session. “I did not feel that the therapist was prepared. The majority of the discussion was asking the same questions as we covered over chat, so this felt like wasted time, and I had hoped that answering these questions in advance would have helped to make a more productive conversation,” he explains.— Jon, platform tester	Consumer Sentiment Indexing for Calmerry

Once an individual chooses a provider, they can then decide between in-person or online therapy. Users can then book sessions directly on their provider’s calendar. Before starting therapy, individuals can request a cost estimate of how much therapy may cost with insurance. While providers set their rates, the average cost per session is $21, according to the company.Our Experience with Grow TherapyOverall, our tester, Dave, found signing up to be a frustration-free process and was extremely pleased with his provider.“They had a warm manner, came to the session well prepared, went through the necessary medical history review efficiently and thoughtfully and left plenty of space for me to talk about my needs and for her to suggest next steps in future sessions. The therapist listened carefully, asked clarification questions where needed and was clearly engaged and thoughtful about my input,” explains Dave.Our tester met with a licensed mental health counselor via live video session for 60 minutes. He found enrollment easy to navigate and was able to select his own therapist from a list of providers. His provider suited his needs and confirmed the appointment within minutes, per Dave. However, if that was not the case, Dave found the process of switching therapists to be a simple one.“It’s easy to change therapists or to reschedule via the platform. The platform even reassures you that it’s typical to try a few therapists initially until you find a good fit, so you’re not locked into a relationship with the first therapist you try,” he says.— Dave, platform tester	Consumer Sentiment Indexing for Grow Therapy

Details, such as session length and cost, depend on the provider—and can vary widely on the platform. For this reason, Sesame serves as more of a directory of therapists than a traditional online therapy platform, showcasing both online and in-person providers available near you. It allows users to search for providers for a range of use cases, including online therapy sessions, mental health consults, psychiatric care or prescription refills. Additionally, for a monthly fee of $10.99, the Sesame Plus membership unlocks deep discounts for therapy sessions with providers in its network.Our Experience with SesameOur platform tester, Megan, appreciated the ability to choose her provider from the start, which seemingly expedited the process of getting started with online therapy.“Therapist selection happened in the very beginning, before even signing up, so if I couldn’t find a therapist that I liked, I didn’t have to sign up. There were a lot of therapist options, and I was able to find some therapists that had same-day or next-day availability, which is useful for someone wanting therapy as soon as possible.”Megan completed a 45-minute video session with a provider found on Sesame.“Once I found a therapist that I liked, I filled out my personal information, reason for visit and paid $104 for the session,” explains Megan. She felt her therapist was very prepared and did a great job.— Megan, platform tester	Consumer Sentiment Indexing for Sesame

The platform accepts more than 360 insurance plans, and its providers offer care for nearly 100 mental health concerns, the company notes. Thriveworks says that many users can experience $0 copays with insurance and no membership fees. Providers are available in person and online, as well as nights and weekends.Our Experience with ThriveworksOur platform tester, Dave, found the Thriveworks interface and first session setup to be a bit peculiar, as the entire first session was purely intake.“[The lengthy intake] didn’t leave any time to really discuss my reasons for seeking therapy, what my primary concerns were, or talk about a plan for the future. This was purely about completing the intake rather than taking the first step towards a therapeutic relationship.”Dave completed a 45-minute live video session with a Thriveworks provider. He didn’t experience any technical difficulties during the sign-up process and felt his intake questionnaire was somewhat helpful in matching him with a provider local to him. However, Dave thought that the user interface left much to be desired.“The interface is a little annoying to navigate. In the initial list of therapists, the visible information for each therapist is quite limited, and it’s not immediately clear what their preferences are for visit type (in person or video) or their specializations. There are filtering options for gender, age, visit type, counseling approach and language. Even after filtering, you need to go into each remaining profile to dig out all the basic information. Better design of the summaries would make the selection process easier.”– Dave, platform tester	Consumer Sentiment Indexing for Thriveworks

Online Therapy: How Does It Work?
Online therapy provides a private, convenient and often affordable way to access mental health help without requiring you to visit a counseling center or therapist’s office in person. Instead, you can connect with your therapist via video call, phone call and/or text message conversation, depending on your needs and preferences. Online therapy is a safe space in which you can address topics like depression, anxiety, stress, anger management, insomnia, panic attacks, eating disorders, trauma, relationship issues, life transitions, bereavement and more.
Different online therapy platforms support different methods of therapy delivery, so first, consider the way(s) in which you would like to receive help.
Some online therapy platforms allow you to purchase one video therapy session at a time, while others require a monthly subscription, which usually includes a single video therapy session a month and access to unlimited text messaging with your therapist. If ongoing communication with your therapist sounds beneficial to you, consider a platform with this subscription option. Just note that “unlimited messaging” means you can text your therapist as much as you like, but your therapist might respond only once or twice a day on weekdays.
Many online therapy services have their own mobile apps as well.
Differences Between Online Therapy and Counseling?
While therapy and counseling are often used interchangeably to refer to dialogue-based treatment for mental health conditions, there are differences in these two types of practices. “Therapist” is an umbrella term and does not necessarily reflect the clinician’s training—experts recommend seeking out the degree earned by the clinician to understand their level of training.
Typically, though, mental health counselors and therapists are each master’s-level health care professionals trained to evaluate an individual’s mental health and provide treatment, depending on their specific training. Counselors typically provide short-term treatment to alleviate symptoms and guide individuals through current concerns or events, such as relationship conflicts or the loss of a loved one. Therapists, on the other hand, may provide long-term treatment that addresses ongoing or chronic mental health concerns and symptoms like depression, anxiety or post-traumatic stress disorder.

Pros and Cons of Online Therapy
Mary Alvord, Ph.D., a psychologist in Maryland who teaches mental health professionals about telehealth, Jay Shore, Ph.D., a psychiatrist and director of telemedicine at the Helen and Arthur E. Johnson Depression Center at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus and Lisa Henderson, a co-founder of Synchronous Health in Nashville and a Forbes Health Advisory Board member offer these pros and cons for online therapy.
Pros
Circumvents mental health stigma. “For people whom stigma is a concern, especially if they live in a tight-knit community, parking their car outside a counseling center or therapy office can really violate their privacy,” says Henderson. “But online therapy is really discreet and can protect people’s privacy and confidentiality in ways that in-person [therapy] simply cannot.”
Convenience and safety. If you’re unable to travel safely during bad weather or can’t take time out of your workday to travel to and from a mental health professional’s office, a virtual visit can be a good substitute.
Sense of intimacy. Dr. Shore says some patients may prefer their familiar at-home surroundings versus an “artificial clinic environment.” Henderson echoes these sentiments. “In some ways, video is more intimate than being in the same room because we’re in each other’s space,” she says. “You might be in my office, but it’s in my home, so it feels like you’re in my home just as I am in your home. That really bridges a gap, as opposed to being on my turf when you come into my office.”
Similar outcomes. In-person and video visits hold the potential to deliver similar results, according to Dr. Shore. Henderson agrees: “We see just as much, if not more, improvement in online therapy settings. Apples to apples, in-person therapy versus telehealth, there’s really no difference between which one is more effective.”
Easier access. For people who live far from the nearest therapist’s office or counseling center, online therapy can provide a readily available alternative.
Little to no wait time. A virtual appointment may be able to begin on time while an in-office appointment may be delayed by paperwork and other bureaucratic hurdles.
Cons
Nonverbal communication. A therapist may not pick up on a patient’s nonverbal cues during a virtual appointment. Dr. Alvord explains that much of our communication is nonverbal. However, Henderson points out that the proximity of the camera lens during video appointments can provide more visual communication through facial expressions than in an in-person appointment, where a greater physical distance exists between the therapist and the client.
Limited effectiveness for some. Certain patients, such as some children or people with autism spectrum disorder, may not respond well to virtual therapy, Dr. Alvord notes. Individuals with dementia or other cognitive issues also may not do well in virtual sessions without modifications, such as a caregiver being with the patient, explains Dr. Shore.
Technology. Some people’s homes may not be equipped with high-speed internet service, or the patient may not be comfortable with technology, making virtual therapy difficult or even impossible.
Does Insurance Cover Online Therapy?
According to the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), an agency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), most insurance providers’ coverage includes some type of telehealth service, and private insurance coverage is required to reimburse telemedicine in 42 states and Washington, D.C. Many commercial health plans have also increased the number of telehealth services available in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Whether your insurance covers online therapy specifically depends on your specific insurance provider and plan.
Does Medicare Cover Online Therapy?
Certain telehealth services—including teletherapy—are covered by Medicare Part B. If you’re enrolled in Medicare Part B, you must pay your annual deductible and 20% of the Medicare-approved cost for your health care provider’s services before accessing the benefits offered by this coverage, as well as the benefits of a Medicare Advantage plan or Part D prescription drug plan (if you’re enrolled in them). Costs for many telehealth services are similar to those of in-person care.
Does Medicaid Cover Online Therapy?
Medicaid coverage for telehealth varies from state to state, and many states expanded their Medicaid coverage to include telehealth services, such as those that are asynchronous (happen online) or originate within the home, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Check the Medicaid website to see what your state may cover.

Is Online Therapy Effective?
Some research shows that online therapy can be promising for depression and other behavioral outcomes[2]Andersson G, Cuijpers P. Internet-based and other computerized psychological treatments for adult depression: a meta-analysis. Cogn Behav Ther. 2009;38(4):196-205. . Research also shows that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) may be just as effective online as it is in person, but further studies are needed[3]Ruwaard J, Lange A, Schrieken B, Dolan CV, Emmelkamp P (2012). The Effectiveness of Online Cognitive Behavioral Treatment in Routine Clinical Practice. PLOS ONE 7(7): e40089. .
Additionally, studies have shown there is no difference in patient satisfaction between traditional in-person therapy and online therapy, but the number of times a person attends sessions makes a difference in their personal outcome[4]Does Online Therapy Work?. National Center for Health Research. Accessed 6/10/2025. .
According to the American Psychological Association (APA), online therapy can also be more convenient, appear less expensive, feel more comfortable for patients and offer wider access for those unable to visit an office in person.
Is Online Therapy Federally Regulated?
Regulation of online therapy sites and mobile apps—an area of mental health known as telebehavioral health or telemental health—is a bit of a hodgepodge.
Both the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) regulate some, but not all, medical apps. The safety of medical apps “is an emerging public health issue,” say researchers in a 2020 study in the Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association[5]Stoll J, Müller JA, Trachsel M. Ethical issues in online psychotherapy: A narrative review. Frontiers in Psychiatry. 2020;10:993. . They called for the establishment of “vigilant regulatory frameworks” to govern these apps.
As the FDA “continues to develop a framework for oversight, industry professionals have noted that the agency has taken a hands-off approach for mental health apps in particular,” say researchers in The Regulatory Review, a publication by the University of Pennsylvania’s Program on Regulation[6]Saba A, Enrico C, Farah M. Safety concerns with consumer-facing mobile health applications and their consequences: a scoping review. Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association. 2020;27(2):330–340. .
At the state level, regulation typically focuses on doctors who deliver telehealth services, but state agencies have stepped up their regulation of psychologists, counselors and other mental health professionals who use telehealth. For its part, the American Counseling Association emphasizes that counselors who offer telebehavioral services must adhere to state licensing requirements. Many online therapy sites stress that all of their therapists are licensed.
On top of state regulations, compliance with professional ethical standards and HIPAA may come into play with online therapy.
Online therapy also raises questions about regulation when a therapist is in one state and the patient is in another. Most of the time, therapists can only practice in the state they’re licensed, which means their client must be in the same state, even if the sessions are virtual—an exception would be if they obtained some type of temporary or provisional permit with the state board where the client resides. This is important because therapists must abide by rules and regulations overseen by their specific licensing boards, and interstate cases can cause issues in investigating problems involving a therapist’s professional conduct.
Is Online Therapy Private and Confidential?
Privacy is likely a concern for any individuals accessing online health services. When it comes to online therapy, in particular, feeling comfortable that your information is safe and secure is paramount. If your chosen online therapy provider uses a HIPAA-compliant platform, you can feel certain that your communications are safe and secure. Most online therapy websites include information on what privacy measures they are taking to protect your confidential health information, which you can review to ensure you are comfortable with what a prospective online therapy provider can offer in terms of privacy.
Questions to Ask Before You Sign Up for Online Therapy
Before you commit to online therapy, ask yourself:
Are These Online Therapists Licensed?
Some sites market their services as therapy, but those claims may be false or misleading, says the American Psychological Association (APA), because some therapists may not be professionally licensed.
According to the APA, “therapist” and “psychotherapist” are not “legally protected” words in some states, meaning someone who promotes themselves as a therapist may not be licensed. Numerous online therapy providers promote the fact that its therapists are licensed.
Is Online Therapy the Best Option for Me?
Online therapy may not be right for everyone in every situation. For example, online therapy may not be ideal for people with several mental disorders or who pose a threat to themselves or others, according to a Frontiers in Psychiatry study[7]Regulating Mobile Medical Applications. The Regulatory Review. Accessed 6/10/2025. .
However, research suggests professionals and patients view telehealth favorably and that teletherapy can be effective. “I would say—and have heard some of my clients say, too—that in some ways, online therapy is even a little bit more comfortable than being in the same room,” Henderson says. “And that has implications on people feeling relaxed and opening up.”
Does My Insurance Cover Online Therapy?
If an online therapy provider accepts insurance, it can bill your insurer directly. You’ll still be responsible for your copays and deductibles. If the site doesn’t accept insurance, you may be able to submit your bills to the insurer for reimbursement, depending on your plan. You may also need a diagnosis in order to use insurance.
Meanwhile, you may be able to use your health savings account (HSA) or flexible spending account (FSA) to pay for online therapy.
What To Look For in an Online Therapist
Dr. Alvord suggests asking these questions when selecting an online therapist:
What are the therapist’s qualifications? Is the therapist a mental health professional licensed in the state where they live or work? How many years have they been in practice?
Does the therapist specialize in certain areas, topics or issues related to mental health? Do these specialties align with your needs? How many patients have they treated that have concerns similar to yours?
What modality does the therapist practice (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy, psychodynamic therapy, somatic experiencing therapy, etc.)? What specific tools do they have to treat your specific concerns?
Will the therapist ask you to sign an informed consent agreement? Informed consent educates a patient about treatment risks, benefits and alternatives.
What would the therapist’s backup plan be in case you’re experiencing a mental health emergency but can’t reach the therapist?
Does the therapist’s platform comply with privacy and security rules laid out by HIPAA?

How To Choose the Best Online Therapy for You
When deciding which online therapy service is best for you, it’s important to consider what you want in a therapist, how you want to receive therapy and what the cost could be with or without insurance.
It can be challenging to compare online therapy platforms due to their wide range of plans and prices. Based on our research, here are several ways to identify the best online therapy for you:
Decide the format in which you want to receive therapy. That might be a live video session, phone call, text messaging conversation, live text chat or a combination.
Look at plan options that best match the amount of interaction you want. For example, if you want live video sessions, know how many you will get a month in the plan, how long they are (30 minutes versus 50 minutes) and how much it would cost to add extra video sessions in a month.
Contact customer service to clarify the details if you’re unsure. For example, can you pause a subscription for a week or two? How do you change therapists if you’re not happy with your current provider?
Understand the refund policy, which isn’t always clear on the website. In many cases, you can cancel your subscription at the end of a month, but you won’t receive a refund for your unused days.
Make sure you can access the type of provider you want. For example, if you want sessions with a psychiatrist, confirm the service has one available in your state.
Ask if you can interview therapists to find the right fit. You’ll be sharing intimate details and working through deep issues with this person, so you want to be sure you’re comfortable with them and can build rapport well. You may want to ask them where they received their training, what therapeutic modalities they practice and what ideas they have about addressing your specific concerns.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
What is the best online therapy platform?
The best online therapy brand is largely individual, as not everyone seeking online therapy is looking for the same thing. Our ranking of best online therapy brands includes optimal choices in terms of access, plan variety, session length and more. Narrow down your options by researching which online therapy platform would best serve your specific needs.
What is the best online therapy service covered by insurance?
There are several online therapy services that accept insurance. The best match for you will depend on what kind of therapy you are seeking. If you have questions about what your insurance plan covers, you can contact the insurance company directly.
Are online therapists legit?
Not all “online therapists” are legit. To be safe, make sure your therapist has licensing in your state, such as a licensed marriage and family therapist or licensed clinical social worker. The best online therapy services will also have psychiatrists and/or psychologists available.
Which online therapy platforms can prescribe medication?
Most therapists cannot prescribe medication, regardless of whether you meet with them online or in person—a psychiatrist is typically the prescriber for those medications. A couple of online therapy services we evaluated have plans that specifically include medication in the pricing: Cerebral and Brightside. Other online therapy services, such as Amwell, can connect you with professionals who can prescribe.
What are the potential risks of online therapy?
Potential risks of online therapy may include misunderstandings or miscommunications due to a lack of nonverbal cues in teletherapy settings, technological difficulties and inability to detect and address emergency or crisis situations. Additionally, online therapy may not be suitable for all individuals or those with severe mental health conditions.
What should I do if I can’t afford therapy?
There are many options for affordable or free therapy. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) offers a host of resources for mental health support, including crisis support chat and recommendations for free or low-cost mental health care. Additionally, the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) provides information for mental health resources, including online support groups and a directory with recommended online mental health services.
A variety of telehealth companies have reduced-price therapy options. Additionally, you may be able to access free therapy through the following resources:
College campuses for students
Doctoral program training clinics for non-students
Individualized Education Plan (IEP) for high school students
The Trevor Project for LGBTQ young people
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for parents
The Therapy Aid Coalition for health care professionals and first responders
Free Black Therapy for Black and African American individuals
U.S. Vets or the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs for veterans
Is online therapy better via chat, video or phone?
“Each [communication] format plays a significant role in the total therapy process,” says Henderson. “If you’re doing anything that I would consider deep work—trying to resolve trauma, getting into the roots of addictions or eating disorders, anything where you’re doing a lot of processing—I prefer video. You need to be able to see and read body language.”
Meanwhile, Henderson says texting is fantastic for check-ins around skill building and using those new skills. Texting or check-ins between live sessions are often used in dialectical behavior therapy to reinforce the client’s practice of evidence-based skills when they encounter difficult situations.
As far as phone calls go, Henderson suggests this format is best for navigating gray areas. “It’s harder to coach without getting into processing on the phone, but if it’s complicated and you need to work through why something didn’t work, then the phone would certainly be better than texting,” she adds.
How much does online therapy cost?
Online therapy costs vary based on the type of care needed and what your employer, insurance or health plan covers. For example, a telehealth service such as BetterHelp charges $60 to $90 weekly, while traditional therapy may be between $75 and $200 a session. However, there are also affordable online therapy options available.

Who benefits most from online therapy?
Many people are likely to need mental health support due to a myriad of issues, as well as the lasting effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Certain disorders and issues may be better suited for virtual therapy than others. It’s usually appropriate and effective to address anxiety disorders, body image issues and guilt issues with online therapy. People seeking personal growth can benefit from the online therapy format as well, according to research.
Who should not use online therapy?
Individuals living with certain conditions may need more help than online therapy can provide. Some of these individuals and/or situations include:
Individuals with suicidal ideation or intent to harm themselves or others
Those with borderline personality disorder
Those with thought disorders, which may include symptoms of delusions, hallucinations and disorganized thinking that are associated with disorders like schizophrenia
Medical issues that aren’t well-monitored
How can I prepare for an online therapy session?
Dr. Alvord and Dr. Shore provide these tips for getting ready for an online therapy session:
Make sure you’re able to chat with your online therapist in a private space, perhaps even in a car if you’re at work or home and can’t find an otherwise suitable spot.
If you’re undergoing therapy via video, be sure your surroundings are properly lit so the therapist can clearly see you.
Check whether your computer, internet connection and other required technology are working properly ahead of your appointment.
Limit disruptions during your therapy session. For instance, you can hang a sign on the door asking people not to come in during a certain period.
What type of therapist is right for me?
The best therapist for you will depend on your unique needs and preferences, as well as what you’re looking to get out of therapy. For example, one person might prefer a therapist who’s more blunt, while another may prefer a provider who uses more sensitive language. It’s all about considering what’s most important to you, such as credentials or expertise, for example, and moving forward with a therapist that checks those boxes.
