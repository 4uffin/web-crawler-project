Commissions we earn from partner links on this page do not affect our opinions or evaluations. Our editorial content is based on thorough research and guidance from the Forbes Health Advisory Board.
If you’re thinking about starting online therapy to improve your mental health, you may wonder whether the cost of such a service is covered by traditional medical insurance providers. However, online therapy pricing and coverage details can be tough to track down, especially in a market flooded with options.
To help answer your questions and narrow your search, the Forbes Health editorial team spent dozens of hours testing and analyzing digital platforms to rank the top online therapy providers that accept insurance. Our staff also spent time trying each service, experiencing the platforms as they exist and participating in real sessions with select providers. Factors such as the number of insurance providers accepted, cost of care, clinician quality, types of plans offered and transparency around pricing were considered.
Read on to discover the best online therapy platforms that take insurance.
Note: Individual insurance coverage may vary based on plan, provider and location.

Amwell
5.0
All ratings are determined solely by our editorial team.Cost: Prices start at $109 for a single video therapy sessionTherapy services available: Individual therapy, couples therapy Therapy formats: Live video sessions with optional messagingSession length: Approximately 45 minutesProviders in network: 1,000 active providers in networkInsurance providers accepted: Aetna, Anthem, Blue Cross Blue Shield, Beacon Health, Medicare, UnitedHealthcare and moreAccepts HSA/FSA: YesOffers Psychiatry/Medication Services: Yes Why We Chose AmwellWhen considering online therapy platforms that take insurance, it’s impossible to ignore that Amwell accepts as many as 50 different insurance providers—including Medicare—which makes the platform among the most widely accepted services on this ranking. Especially for those who prefer to pay per session rather than as part of a subscription, the offering is hard to beat.It’s an added bonus that Amwell offers specialized services for LGBTQ+ individuals and other minority groups. Our tester also found the platform easy to use, making Amwell a strong potential option for both usability and affordability alike.Our Experience with AmwellThrough hands-on experience, our tester really liked Amwell’s platform usability, but found the individual conversation with a therapist lacking a personal touch.“Amwell is an easy platform to use. The therapy session itself was mundane. I felt like I was answering survey questions instead of engaging in conversation.” — Miguel, Amwell testerAccount setup was described as quick and easy, with only an email address and intake questionnaire required for registration. Once enrolled, Miguel appreciated the ability to quickly select a therapist and see their availability. During the testing period, the platform operated seamlessly, with no experienced technical issues, appointment snafus or billing errors.Issues cropped up in the actual therapy session, though, as Miguel suggested the provider seemed unprepared. The therapist mostly repeated questions already asked in the intake survey, leading our tester to wonder if they might have a better experience with another provider. The therapist reminded Miguel that a selected therapist can be changed at any time.	Consumer Sentiment Index

Consumers have mixed perceptions of Amwell. They appreciate the platform for its accessibility and convenience factors. It’s said that it’s easy to schedule an appointment through Amwell’s straightforward interface, and its therapists are respectful to clients once the consultations begin. Despite these advantages, Amwell’s positive reviews are marred by frustration from technical glitches, customer service snafus and occasional billing errors. While some customers truly enjoy using Amwell, others might hesitate to recommend it.

Teladoc
4.8
All ratings are determined solely by our editorial team.Cost: Approximately $119 per sessionTherapy services available: Individual therapy, marriage and family therapists availableTherapy formats: Video, phone, optional messaging in between sessionsSession length: 45 minutesProviders in network: UndisclosedInsurance providers accepted: Aetna and many other work-related benefit plansAccepts HSA/FSA: YesOffers Psychiatry/Medication Services: Yes Why We Chose TeladocTeladoc stands out for working with nearly 90 different insurance providers, ideal for people who may have a more niche health plan. The therapist selection process allows users to select a provider that matches their desired profile and qualifications. Those who have LGBTQ+ or minority-specific concerns to discuss, for instance, will most likely find a worthy provider on Teladoc.The platform also has a well-established community sentiment, with a B rating on the Better Business Bureau and a rating of 4.7 on Trustpilot. On critical issues such as platform usability and effective sessions, Teladoc fared well in our independent evaluation.Our Experience with TeladocThrough testing, Teladoc received generally positive feedback for its straightforward interface, minimal technical hurdles and attentive provider, though there were some minor snags with provider punctuality and billing.“The overall experience was very positive. The therapist was easy going, skilled in asking questions, listening to the answers and providing interesting information and suggestions.” — Manni, Teladoc testerWhen trying Teladoc via phone and laptop for 45-minute sessions, Manni most appreciated the app’s integrated video solution that required no additional downloads. This fluidity continued during sessions. Notifications were sent about 10 minutes ahead of appointments, and at that time, Manni was easily able to log in and start conversing.That said, testing did reveal some potential issues in billing, where the chosen care plan and the initial visit were charged at the same time. And while the introductory therapy session was mostly productive, the provider did arrive a few minutes late. Taking all of this into account, however, Manni said they would consider using Teladoc again in the future.	Consumer Sentiment Index

Customers like Teladoc Health for its convenience, cost and timely appointments, but the general sentiment about the service remains negative. Common criticisms include rushed medical advice, billing errors and even improper diagnoses. Customer service is also noted to be ineffective, causing patrons to question the platform’s overall value.

Talkspace
4.6
All ratings are determined solely by our editorial team.Cost: $65 for individual sessions, $396 per month for subscriptionTherapy services available: Individual therapy, couples therapyTherapy formats: Text, audio messages, video messages, live sessions Session length: 60 minutes or 24/7 through messagingProviders in network: 5,000 active providers in networkInsurance providers accepted: Aetna, Cigna, Optum, Carelon, Regence, Medicare and othersAccepts HSA/FSA: YesOffers Psychiatry/Medication Services: Yes	Learn More	On Talkspace's Website Why We Chose TalkspaceFor those who prefer a bevy of options, Talkspace is a strong choice. This is particularly true regarding its massive network of 5,000 active providers. We also love the great variety of communication options that give users a therapy experience that suits their individual communication styles.If you want to connect with a therapist purely through text and media messages, Talkspace has a suite of features to match. Customers also seem to appreciate Talkspace, given that the service has an A+ Better Business Bureau rating and a 4.3-star rating on Trustpilot.Our Experience with TalkspaceOverall, our tester had a positive experience trying Talkspace, appreciating its therapist for a session that was warm and attentive to user needs. The platform was easy to use and bug-free, and its appointment reminders remained effective.“The therapist was warm and approachable, and her genuine, nonjudgmental manner made me feel comfortable. That sense of sincerity really motivated me to keep going.” — Jonny, Talkspace testerThe individual’s needs were also a focal point of other aspects of our Talkspace experience as well. From the personal videos featured on provider pages to a customer service team that went above and beyond to resolve our inquiries, this platform proved to be a strong selection.However, for anyone who prefers to pick providers from a list of available options, the Talkspace formula may leave something to be desired, matching users to just one provider at a time. It’s possible to change if the selection isn’t a fit, but because it only shows one option, finding the top therapist for your needs may take time. Testing also revealed small fluctuations in price, though those may vary based on location, concern or your insurance provider.	Consumer Sentiment Index

Like many other online therapy platforms, Talkspace is appreciated by customers for its convenience. Online customer sentiment, however, generally shifts negative due to reported frustrations with poor customer service, billing errors and mistakes made while using insurance. Negative critiques regarding app reliability and general business policies are also common.

Brightside Health
4.5
All ratings are determined solely by our editorial team.Cost: $299 a month for four live video therapy sessions and anytime messaging (single video therapy session not available)Therapy services available: Individual therapyTherapy formats: Live video sessions with anytime messagingSession length: 45 minutesProviders in network: 1,500 active providers in networkInsurance providers accepted: Aetna, Cigna, UnitedHealthcare, Blue Cross Blue Shield, Medicare, Anthem and othersAccepts HSA/FSA: YesOffers Psychiatry/Medication Services: Yes	Learn More	On Brightside's Website Why We Chose Brightside HealthBrightside Health is a great online therapy option, particularly if you have a Medicaid plan that doesn’t cover the other above-listed services. It’s got an expansive network of 1,500 providers, which should offer plenty of variety to find your perfect match.That said, there are some caveats. Users must be comfortable with a subscription-based service, and the therapist selection emphasizes automatic matching as opposed to fully manual selection. With a B+ grade at the Better Business Bureau and a 4.2-star Trustpilot rating, though, it would seem customers generally appreciate this platform.Our Experience with Brightside HealthOur tester had a positive experience while trying Brightside Health for an introductory session. They found the video conferencing platform to be free of technical glitches, appreciated the service’s anxiety-tracking tools and had a great opening interaction with their matched provider.“Having tried therapy platforms before, I was relieved the connection was strong and I didn’t experience any technical issues. I was pleased with the therapist I was matched with and found the session insightful.” — Meaghan, Brightside Health testerHaving a strong, stable internet connection to your therapist is critical to any online therapy platform, and Brightside Health proved reliable in our testing. Our tester also praised a few unique features, such as the depression and anxiety rating tool that does a good job of establishing your baseline level for those experiences. In session, the provided therapist was “professional, warm and prepared,” placing proper emphasis on goal setting.Less favorable, however, was the discovery that Brightside Health subscriptions are nonrefundable. Providers are also primarily matched based on time availability rather than specialty, with many critical filtering options seemingly unavailable. Despite these minor flaws, our tester still walked away feeling comfortable enough to recommend Brightside to others.	Consumer Sentiment Index

Brightside Health is most often praised for its convenience and is reported by some to offer a true pathway toward improved mental health. However, while some have enjoyed a great experience with their matched providers, others have not. Commonly reported negatives include billing issues, poor customer service, insufficient communication and a lackluster app experience. It’s also suggested that the process for finding care lacks professionalism and needs a more personal touch.

Cerebral
4.1
All ratings are determined solely by our editorial team.Cost: $295 for either two or four sessions per month, depending on need. Additional sessions can be purchased for $135.Therapy services available: Individual therapy, couples therapyTherapy formats: Video, phone and messaging between sessionsSession length: 45 minutesProviders in network: 350 active providersInsurance providers accepted: UnitedHealthcare, Optum, Cigna, Blue Cross Blue Shield and othersAccepts HSA/FSA: YesOffers Psychiatry/Medication Services: Yes	Learn More	On Cerebral's Website Why We Chose CerebralCerebral is a goals-focused, online mental health platform focused on defining milestones in customized plans and working toward achieving them. The fact that the platform advertises its qualified and diverse providers caught our attention, as did the platform’s large number of reviews across Android and iOS. Cerebral currently has a 4.2-star rating on Trustpilot.Admittedly, Cerebral’s provider network and list of accepted insurers are the smallest of any service on this ranking, but that doesn’t necessarily make for a worse experience as long as you meet the right qualifications. With its LGBTQ+ specializations, Cerebral is positioned as an online therapy platform for the modern age.Our Experience with CerebralOur tester appreciated Cerebral for its clean user interface, effective reminders and strong therapeutic experience. Account creation was smooth, and the ability to select from a list of providers made the user feel in control. Cerebral is perhaps best enjoyed by those comfortable with a subscription therapy option.“The provider bios were very thorough. The overall approach to therapy, areas of expertise, qualifications, location and scheduling availability were also clearly presented. There was even an inspirational quote. Delightful!” — Dave, Cerebral testerSetup took about 10 minutes to complete, after which our tester was able to choose a therapist from a list of bios, with optional filters for specialties and focal areas if required. In particular, our tester enjoyed Cerebral’s interface, which helps keep sessions, messages and any appointment scheduling needs top of mind. Even in the introductory session, meaningful discussion began quickly.Cerebral’s biggest mentioned downside is its strict adherence to its subscription model. If missing sessions for vacation, for example, customers may be expected to pay in full for all sessions even if they’re missed. This policy may not matter to those with predictable schedules, but our tester noted it may create problems for people who are often busy.	Consumer Sentiment Index

Cerebral is valued for its convenience, ease of scheduling and team of effective therapists and prescribers. Unfortunately, these strong aspects are diminished by reports of poor billing and customer service experiences, as well as a general lack of transparency when these issues arise. Refunds may also be difficult to obtain for those who need one. A 2024 FTC ruling in which Cerebral is alleged to have deceived users about its data sharing and privacy policies has made some customers question the platform as a whole.

How To Find Online Therapy Services Covered By Your Insurance
Many online therapy platforms state which insurance plans they accept directly on their website. If your insurance plan isn’t listed, contact your insurance provider to determine which platforms are in your plan’s network.
What To Look for When Choosing an Online Therapy Provider
Choosing the right online therapist to suit your needs is a highly individualized process. Here are a few noteworthy aspects to be aware of, with insight from industry experts.
Security and structure: “When opting for virtual sessions, the hope is you’ll find someone who creates a safe, secure, consistent and confidential space in the same way you would strive for in person,” explains Olivia Verhulst, a licensed psychotherapist, telehealth provider and Forbes Health Advisory Board member.
Addresses your concerns: “Confirming your therapist has the necessary training and qualifications to meet your specific needs is crucial to ensuring you receive appropriate treatment,” says Rufus Tony Spann, Ph.D., a nationally certified school psychologist, licensed professional counselor and Forbes Health Advisory Board member. Check all licenses and certifications to ensure your therapist is able to practice.
How therapists are assigned: Online therapy platforms can assign therapists in a number of ways. Some allow users to pick a therapist from a virtual bio, while others may use a proprietary method to match therapists with patients via an intake questionnaire. Research each platform to see if it matches your style.
Within your budget: While online therapy has the potential to conveniently improve your mental health, it’s important to find care that meets your budget. This is especially true considering therapy can be an ongoing process with ongoing costs. As tempting as it may be to choose the best and most expensive therapist on the market, their services are likely to be less helpful if you can only afford to attend a few visits.
Check for fees: Make sure you understand whether or not you will be charged fees related to your insurance costs. These may include an increased copay cost for specialist visits or any other out-of-network penalty.
If an individual is at risk of self-harm, requires access to complex treatments or is unable to read body language, Dr. Spann and Verhulst suggest seeking a provider that can provide in-person sessions.
Whether you’re attending therapy in person or virtually, Verhulst says she believes selecting the right therapist is a matter of personal comfort, as well as determining if the provider offers the care that’s most beneficial to you.
Does Medicare Cover Online Therapy?
Medicare does cover certain outpatient mental health therapies via Medicare Part B, including regular visits with psychiatrists, clinical psychologists and clinical social workers. Medicare Part B offers 80% coverage of certain mental health care after your deductible is met. A 2024 expansion of care widened coverage to include marriage counseling, family counseling and mental health counseling as well. Make sure the online platform and therapist you choose are accepted by Medicare to secure coverage.
The best Medicare Advantage plans may also cover any mental health services that aren’t covered with Original Medicare. However, this coverage is determined by the provider and plan you choose.
Does Medicaid Cover Online Therapy?
As Medicaid is a state-run program, coverage for mental health services can vary depending on the state in which you live. However, all states must offer certain mental health coverage for adults. Keep in mind, not all online therapy platforms accept Medicaid. Online therapy platforms that may accept Medicaid include:

It’s always best to consult mental health and insurance providers about insurance coverage before beginning care.
How To Use Insurance For Online Therapy
Using insurance to help cover online therapy works just as it would for any other doctor’s visit, test, operation or medical service. You may receive “full coverage” as part of a medical plan, which means your therapy provider can bill insurance providers directly. In this instance, members are often asked to pay a predetermined copay amount dictated in the plan. Given this reality, it should be noted that “full coverage” doesn’t always mean you’ll pay $0 for a visit.
Alternatively, it’s possible your provider may help fund online therapy sessions through reimbursement. Should this be the case, you’ll pay the entirety of the cost up front and your insurance provider will give a portion of those costs back to you as part of a superbill. The amount that you’re reimbursed is dictated by your plan.
Check with your insurance provider to ensure coverage and to determine how that coverage will be billed.
What If My Insurance Doesn't Cover Online Therapy?
Online therapy can cost anywhere from $85 to $200 per visit in out-of-pocket costs if your insurance provider doesn’t offer coverage for the type of online therapy you prefer.
That said, if your employer offers HSA and FSA benefits, you may be able to pay for online therapy from that balance. Keep a detailed record of all receipts and charges in case your FSA or HSA provider requires additional documentation.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
Why don’t all online therapy companies accept insurance?
An online therapy platform may not accept insurance if the reimbursement rate is too low for the therapist or if the payment structure doesn’t align with how the provider prefers to administer billing. Rather than rely on insurance companies to reimburse, some practitioners opt not to accept insurance.
If you see a therapy service you’re interested in using, it’s always best to call the company directly to learn more about their latest coverage policies.
What's the best way to find an online therapist covered by insurance?
The best way to find an online therapist who accepts your insurance is to start by searching for a platform that accepts your insurance coverage, then selecting a therapist within that platform.
How can I find out if my insurance is accepted by an online therapy provider?
To be absolutely certain your online therapy sessions are covered by insurance, contact your insurance representative and your desired therapy service. Phone, chat and email contacts are often found on insurance or therapy platform support pages. Ensure that both the insurer and therapy platform confirm the status of your coverage before starting therapy.
