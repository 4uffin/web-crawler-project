MailerSend failing to send email

I am trying to send an email using MailerSend. I am basing this off a README file in their GitHub repository.
I have installed the library using.
pip install mailersend
Here's my script:
from mailersend import MailerSendClient, EmailBuiler
from dotenv import load_env
load_dotenv()
ms = MailerSendClient()
email = (EmailBuilder().from_email('[email protected]', 'Cybershield Linknguard').to_many([{'email': '[email protected]', 'name': 'Sivuyise'}])).subject('Test Email').text('This is a test email from MailerSend').build()
response = ms.send(email)
if response.status_code == 202:
print("Email sent successfully!")
else:
print("Failed to send email.")
When I run python send_email.py, I get this error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\Msebetsi Solutions\cyber-shield-linkguard\cyber-shield-linkguard\send_email.py", line 10, in <module>
response = ms.send(email)
^^^^^^^
AttributeError: 'MailerSendClient' object has no attribute 'send'`
pip show mailersend shows that mailersend is installed with version 2.0.0.
I also changed the from_email() parameter to a domain provided by mailersend; it still shows the problem associated with send().
How can I make the script work?
