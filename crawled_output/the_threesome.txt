The Threesome
What to Know
Critics Consensus
A bittersweet rom-com that occasionally waffles as much as its characters in how mature it wants to be, The Threesome balances out into a sweetly shaggy film with standout performances from Zoey Deutch and Ruby Cruz.

It ends up kind of a mixed bag, cute but a bit disjointed.

The film effortlessly melds its sadcom properties with more predictable rom-com traditions.

Deutch and Cruz do all they can to give the film some life, but Hauer-King can’t keep up.

If you don’t mind waiting until the last twenty minutes for the plot to raise your pulse in this love triangle, The Threesome is here for you.
Rated: 6/10

Reel Talk with Chuck and Pam
Wisely, the film doesn’t wimp out and offer up a trite solution to this dilemma but rather a well-thought out conclusion that casts this situation as one brimming with hope.
Rated: 3.5/4.0

Another more confident film could have turned its laissez-faire attitude towards maintaining a consistent tone into a strength, but The Threesome this isn’t that film.

The trailer pitched an interesting premise but the execution was very uneven. The humor definitely wasn't there as much as you would have though and some of the casting felt wasted. I think the movie couldn't fully decide what it wanted to be. Did a solid job of not being an exactly by the numbers rom com.

Every man's fantasy of a threesome with two hot women becomes his worst nightmare when they both turn up pregnant. The story definitely kept you guessing how this was going to end. The ending turned out to be surprising but satisfying, with a lot of laughs along the way. Cute, funny movie with good performances by all.

David from Vegas
Maybe because of the title and trailer previews, one might think it's about sensational sex. But the story goes much deeper. An unexpected encounter, a lot of drinking, leads to several careless decisions on everyone's part. Weeks later the repercussions start to develop and appear unexpectedly. Now new realities must be dealt with. The main characters are well casted and do a good job as the screenplay unfolds.
Bonus, stay for some funny outtakes.
