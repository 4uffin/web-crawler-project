I'm a fan of event sourcing architecture [1]. This looks like a good backend for it.[1]: https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.htmlreplyshikhar 11 minutes ago

Very cool! Maybe you'll consider turning it distributed by using s2.dev for the append-only event logs :)Someone tried this with XTDB, https://github.com/chucklehead-dev/s2-logreplytwosdai 1 hour ago

Really interesting! I used influxdb for a while. I see one of the core features is to have AS OF <some date time> be used for historical reference.Is this similar to running an append only data structure in a normal tsdb, and then querying by date time and taking the most recent value in that data set? Or is it different.replyrefset 24 minutes ago

Looks like DriftDB is focused on the 'system time' AS OF dimension, a.k.a. rollback querying. AsOf joins are more about doing analysis over user-defined domain timestamps (/ 'valid time'). Combining both concepts gets you a bitemporal database.replywithinboredom 1 hour ago

Nice! I built one of these at a previous company for AI training. It’s nice to see an open source version. Did you look into any of the Temporal SQL papers by chance? There’s some nice syntax when you want to join across time.replyrefset 27 minutes ago

The SQL:2011 syntax puts the temporal filters directly after base table reference (and before the table alias) [0]i.e. it would be `SELECT * FROM orders FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF "@seq:1000" WHERE customer_id="cust1"` rather than `SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id="cust1" AS OF "@seq:1000"` (the latter being an example from the DriftDB readme)[0] https://docs.xtdb.com/reference/main/sql/queries.html#_tempo...replyerichocean 25 minutes ago

XTDB can also do this, open source, free license.replywrl 36 minutes ago

Yet more vibe-coded spam. For context, this is the same author who just got flagged off the front page for an LLM-written book about Lisp.replyDavidCanHelp 14 minutes ago

More context: haters are saying LLM generated content is bad. As a Senior Full Stack Developer with over 26 years of pro experience, I'm having the time of my life with these new AI powers and the doors and discussions they open. People are upvoting. I'm personally not getting anything from this open source sharing. You're the one calling spam. When you pay 200 a month to max your claude code output and really hunker down, think twice before you share its work. Not everyone understands.replyOutOfHere 6 minutes ago

It is absurd to pay $200 a month for it when GitHub Copilot has agentic development basically for free for open source developers, including GPT/Claude/Gemini models. If you want to waste your own money, fine, but don't expect others to waste a single dollar of their money when decent options are available at no cost.Especially Claude is well known for wasting output tokens, for maximizing output token use when fewer tokens would do just fine, although other models too have picked up this disease as of late.Yes, better models could produce better output, but in my experience, the quality of the output depends 10x more on the clarity and refinement of the input.reply
