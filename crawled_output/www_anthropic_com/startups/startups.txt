We say software creators because we donât think itâs just going to be developers. Anyone should be able to create software.âAmjad Masad, CEO and Co-founderâWeâre automating the mundane. 80% of Sales work today is manual, laborious, data work. In the era of AI, humans can focus on truly human, creative work, and we can leave the data work in the hands of AI.âMatthew Quan, Enterprise Growth LeadâWeâre trying to model human cognition. We need systems that are agentic in nature. They have to have planning, subgoal decomposition, reflection on failure, refinement of tasks as they act. They need memory, both short-term and long-term. They need to be able to retrieve information and use tools. Anthropic and Claude have consistently delivered what we need to get there.âEno Reyes, CTO and Co-founderâClaude Sonnet is the enabling technology that made this product possible, period.âEric Simons, CEO and Co-founderâWe want to serve the best AI and make sure that we give such a good experience to our users that they feel like they canât get it anywhere else.âAarash Heydari, Infrastructure EngineerâClaude consistently ranks among the most accurate generative AI models available, and continues to push innovation forward with each update.âTomas Reimers, Co-founder"Weâre seeing lots of people that are close to business problems now being empowered to drive execution independently with our AI Software Engineerâitâs 20 times faster than writing the code themselves"Anton Osika, CEO & Co-founderâClaude Sonnet 4 surpasses Sonnet 3.7 with higher success rates, more surgical code edits, and more tightly scoped changes. It works more carefully through complex tasks and delivers superior code qualityâmaking it the ideal choice as the primary coding model in Augment Code.âGuy Gur-Ari, Co-founderPrevPrevNextNextResources for startupsLearn more about AI with our free coursesLearn more about AI with our free coursesLearn more about AI with our free coursesCoursesCoursesCoursesSee upcoming events or watch past recordingsSee upcoming events or watch past recordingsSee upcoming events or watch past recordingsEventsEventsEventsGet the latest updates from AnthropicGet the latest updates from AnthropicGet the latest updates from AnthropicNewsNewsNewsFAQWho is eligible for the Anthropic for Startups Program?The program is available to startups working with Anthropicâs VC partners.
