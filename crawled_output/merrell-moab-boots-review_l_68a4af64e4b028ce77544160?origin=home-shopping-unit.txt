From national park trails that look like the surface of Mars to African bush walks, the terrain I’ve navigated puts my footwear through the ringer – and some of it couldn’t keep up. The last thing to worry about on a trip is sore feet, blisters or – even worse – not being able to walk as you normally do. But one pair finally earned its permanent place in my bag: Merrell’s Moab 3 boots. They’re the only shoes I’d bring again, no matter where in the world I’m headed.$140 at Zappos$140 at Merrell$89+ at AmazonOn a recent expedition to the Galápagos Islands, I was pleasantly surprised at how light these boots felt while enduring boat rides, hikes, and lava field walks. They didn’t weigh me down or make my legs ache after hours in the heat. In fact, I sometimes forgot I was wearing proper hiking boots at all, thinking it was a lighter sneaker. For a trip that demanded both endurance and agility, they were ideal.Advertisement
James Barrett / Via Instagram: @jimmyroxThe excellent grip on any surface was a game changer as I hiked through Arches National Park in Moab, Utah. (Yes, that’s where the shoe got its name.) The terrain at this visually stunning destination is no joke: you’ll need to navigate dusty switchbacks, slick rock, and loose sand, all while not freaking out over the steep drop off. These boots never slipped, even when I scrambled up rough inclines or edged along sandstone ledges. Vibram’s grippy TC5+ outsole dug in with confidence, making every step feel secure. By the end of the day, my footing was the one thing I didn’t have to think about, and I was able to hike three miles to visit the park’s most iconic site: the Delicate Arch. (For those craving more, the Double O Arch hike is not for the faint of heart but definitely worth the views.) Advertisement

Walking through the bush meant moving through tall grass, rocky outcrops, and dry, dusty trails — terrain that requires more than a simple sneaker. These boots held up beautifully, with the suede and mesh shrugging off scratches while still letting my feet breathe. Advertisement
The air-cushioned heel softened the impact when we walked for hours, starting the day from before sunrise, and I never felt unstable stepping over uneven ground. Even after days on safari, the boots still looked and felt solid.James BarrettThe Narrows at Zion National Park requires hikers to traverse a river, and the water can be chest-high depending on the day. Please, whatever you do, make sure you wear the right footwear. It’s a mile down to the river and there’s absolutely no cell phone service, so a rescue mission can take the entire day.Advertisement
Wading through water would ruin most boots, but not these. They kept my feet surprisingly dry through splashes and shallow crossings, and even when they did get wet, they dried quickly without feeling heavy. The non-slip grip on wet rocks was a lifesaver, too. For hikes that mix water and rock, they were up to the task.No matter the destination—desert, jungle, mountain, or river—these boots have proven they can handle it all without complaint. They’ve carried me comfortably through some unforgettable adventures and still have plenty of miles left in them. If you’re looking for one pair of hiking boots you can actually trust anywhere, these are it. Your feet will thank you and they make you look like a serious adventurer!$140 at Zappos$140 at Merrell$89+ at AmazonAdvertisement
