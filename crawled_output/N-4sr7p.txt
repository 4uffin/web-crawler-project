If we are able to identify you as a Target Guest we may, for example, link your activity on our website to your activity in a Target store or on one of our mobile application(s). This allows us to provide you with a personalized experience regardless of how you interact with us – online, in store, mobile, etc.In order to provide the best Guest experience possible and run our business operations, we also use automated information collection technologies for reporting and analysis purposes. We examine metrics such as how our marketing efforts are performing and how you are interacting on our website, in our stores, on our mobile application(s), and with our advertisements and emails. Third-party Automated CollectionWe and our service providers use anonymous identifiers such as cookies and other technologies to collect and store certain types of information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over, hardware/software information, cookie and session ID) whenever you interact with us or third-parties that use our services.We also allow third-party companies (e.g., Google) to place tags on our digital properties once approved through our tagging process.

Your interactions with those features are governed by the privacy policies of the companies that provide them.Mobile Location InformationIf you use a mobile device, your device may share location information (when you enable location services) with our websites, mobile application(s), services or our service providers.

When enabled, we may also use your device’s camera (e.g., Apple’s TrueDepth camera) so you can use services such as product visualization (e.g., see item in your space) or virtual try on services (e.g., try on accessories/beauty products). Information collected from your device’s camera for these services is used in real time and is not stored on the servers. The virtual try on experience operates within your own device or browser and the data is deleted after the experience ends.Information From Other SourcesWe collect information about you from other sources to enhance our existing Guest information and improve the accuracy of our records.

If you set your device to not receive cookies at any time, certain personalized services cannot be provided to you, and accordingly, you may not be able to take full advantage of all of our features. To opt-out of the vendors we use for cross-device linking, go to the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Choices page at www.aboutads.info/choices and perform a global opt-out on each browser and device that you would like to be opted out on. Opting out in this manner means that the browser on the device from which you opt-out will no longer receive information collected on devices linked to it, that devices linked to it will not receive information collected from the opted-out device, and that the vendor will not transfer information collected from the opted-out device to a third-party. Please note that this will not opt you out of cross-device linking or advertising across linked devices based solely on your visits to Target websites or application(s), or your interaction with advertisements for Target delivered by Target.To opt-out of our interest-based advertising for Target’s goods and services or those of another party, online and in third-party mobile applications, visit Digital Advertising Alliance’s Choices page here and perform a global opt-out. Options you select are browser and device specific.
To learn more about interest-Based Advertising, visit the Network Advertising Initiative website and the Digital Advertising Alliance website. The opt-out tool described above is cookie-based.
Therefore, the opt-out will only function if your browser is set to accept third-party cookies, and it may not function where cookies are automatically disabled or removed. If you delete cookies, change your browser settings, switch browsers or computers, or use another operating system, you will need to opt-out again. Do Not TrackSome browsers have a “do not track” feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. At this time, we do not respond to browser “do not track” signals. However, Target treats Global Privacy Control signals as opt-out of sale and opt out of targeted/cross-context behavioral advertising requests under applicable state laws (e.g., California Consumer Privacy Act).
