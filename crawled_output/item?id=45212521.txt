That's quite a neat trick. You do need to be careful if the same matrix appears more than once in your einsum call though.replybrandonb 9 hours ago

Very nicely explained. Your article on rendering fractals was also well-done!replytripplyons 6 minutes ago

Nice and easy article for a normally complicated topic.replyfzimmermann89 2 hours ago

..and for complex valued tensors, you need to conjugate.replytripplyons 1 minute ago

I've only accounted for real numbers. I'm not sure how to cleanly account for conjugates when some of the einsums would need them and others wouldn't.For example, a matrix product would need a complex conjugate, but a Hadamard product wouldn't.If there is an elegant way to extend this to complex numbers, let me know!reply
