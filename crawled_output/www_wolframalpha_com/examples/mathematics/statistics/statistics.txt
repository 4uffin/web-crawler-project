Given a set of data, Wolfram|Alpha is instantaneously able to compute all manner of descriptive and inferential statistical properties and to produce regression analyses and equation fitting. Wolfram|Alpha's broad computational knowledge of statistical methods allows you to analyze, interpret and visualize your data quickly and accurately.Descriptive Statistics
› Compute statistical measures that summarize the properties of a dataset.Calculate basic descriptive statistics for a dataset:{25, 35, 10, 17, 29, 14, 21, 31}Compute a statistical quantity:mean {21.3, 38.4, 12.7, 41.6}kurtosis {21.3, 38.4, 12.7, 41.6}More examplesRegression Analysis
› Fit different parameterized models to data.Fit a line to two-dimensional data:linear fit {1.3, 2.2},{2.1, 5.8},{3.7, 10.2},{4.2, 11.8}Fit a polynomial to given data:cubic fit 20.9,23.2,26.2,26.4,16.3,-12.2,-60.6,-128.9Fit an exponential model to given data:exponential fit 0.783,0.552,0.383,0.245,0.165,0.097More examplesStatistical Inference
› Use statistics and hypothesis tests to infer information from a dataset.Find the sample size needed to estimate a binomial parameter:sample size for binomial parameterCompute a confidence interval for a population mean:t-interval xbar=4.15, s=0.32, n=100Apply a test for a population mean:z-test for population meanMore examplesRandom Variables
› Compute the probability of a random variable returning a specified value or falling within a range of values or determine the expected value of a random variable.Compute the expected value of a random variable:X~Poisson(7.3), EV[3X^4-7]Compute the probability of an event:P[-1.2<X<2.3] for X~student t with 12 dofMore examplesGO FURTHERStep-by-Step Solutions for StatisticsStatistics Web AppFree Unlimited Statistics Practice ProblemsRELATED EXAMPLESData InputFile UploadImage InputProbabilityProbability DistributionsSocioeconomic DataRELATED WOLFRAM RESOURCESWolfram Language: Probability and Statistics Guide PageWolfram Language: Statistical Data Analysis Guide PageExplore Statistics on Wolfram MathWorldCommunity: Data Science GroupCommunity: Statistics and Probability GroupProMobile AppsProductsBusinessAPI & Developer SolutionsLLM SolutionsResources & ToolsAboutContactConnect©2025 WolframTermsPrivacywolfram.comWolfram LanguageMathematicaWolfram DemonstrationsWolfram for EducationMathWorld
