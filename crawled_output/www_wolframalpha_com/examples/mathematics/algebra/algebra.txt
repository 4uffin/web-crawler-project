Algebra consists of the study of variables within number systems, along with operations that act on numbers and symbols. Wolfram|Alpha is a tremendous resource for solving equations; exploring polynomials; and studying fields, groups, vectors and matrices.Equation Solving
› Solve equations in one or more variables both symbolically and numerically.Solve a polynomial equation:solve x^2 + 4x + 6 = 0Solve a system of linear equations:x+y=10, x-y=4Solve an equation with parameters:solve a x^2 + b x + c = 0 for xMore examplesRational Functions
