Wolfram|Alpha Examples: Calculus & AnalysisUh oh! Wolfram|Alpha doesn't run without JavaScript.Please enable JavaScript. If you don't know how, you can find instructionshere.Once you've done that, refresh this page to start using Wolfram|Alpha.All Examples›Mathematics›Browse ExamplesExamples forCalculus & AnalysisCalculus is the branch of mathematics studying the rate of change of quantities and the length, area and volume of objects. With the ability to answer questions from single and multivariable calculus, Wolfram|Alpha is a great tool for computing limits, derivatives and integrals and their applications, including tangent lines, extrema, arc length and much more.Integrals
› Compute definite and indefinite integrals of functions. Integrate with respect to one or more variables.Compute an indefinite integral:integrate x^2 sin^3 x dxCompute a definite integral:integrate sin x dx from x=0 to piCompute an improper integral:int sinx/x dx, x=0..infinityMore examplesLimits
› Explore the limit behavior of a function as it approaches a single point or asymptotically approaches infinity.Compute a limit:lim (sin x - x)/x^3 as x->0limit (1+1/n)^n as n->infinityCompute a one-sided limit:lim x/|x| as x->0+More examplesProducts
