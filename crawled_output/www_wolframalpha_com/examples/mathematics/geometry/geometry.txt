Wolfram|Alpha has the ability to analyze and compute with geometric figures of different dimensions, including polygons and polyhedra. It can also solve many applied problems using geometry, like tilings or packing problems. Additionally, Wolfram|Alpha can tell you about more advanced areas such as analytic geometry and topology.Plane Geometry
