Use Wolfram|Alpha to generate plots of functions, equations and inequalities in one, two and three dimensions. Gain additional perspective by studying polar plots, parametric plots, contour plots, region plots and many other types of visualizations of the functions and equations of interest to you.FunctionsGraph a function of one variable as a curve in the plane.Plot a function of one variable:plot x^3 - 6x^2 + 4x + 12graph sin t + cos (sqrt(3)t)plot 4/(9*x^(1/4))Specify an explicit range for the variable:plot e^x from x=0 to 10Plot a real‐valued function:real plot -(sqrt(25-y^2))Plot a special function:plot Ai(x)Plot several functions:plot sin x, cos x, tan xplot x e^-x, x^2 e^-x, x=0 to 8Plot a function on a logarithmic scale:log plot e^x-xPlot on a log-linear scale:log-linear plot x^2 log x, x=1 to 10EquationsPlot the solution set of an equation in two or three variables.Plot the solution to an equation in two variables:plot 3x^2-2xy+y^2=1Plot a quadric surface:plot x^2 - 3y^2 - z^2 = 1Parametric PlotsGraph parametric equations in two or three dimensions.Draw a parametric plot:parametric plot (cos^3 t, sin^3 t)Specify a range for the parameter:parametric plot (sin 10t, sin 8t), t=0..2piDraw a parametric curve in three dimensions:3d parametric plot (cos t, sin 2t, sin 3t)Draw a parametric surface in three dimensions:3d parametric plot (cos u, sin u + cos v, sin v), u=0 to 2pi, v=0 to 2pi3D PlotsPlot a function of two variables as a surface in three-dimensional space.Plot a function in two variables:plot sin x cos ySpecify explicit ranges for the variables:plot x^2 y^3, x=-1..1, y=0..3InequalitiesPlot the solution set of an inequality or system of inequalities.Plot the region satisfying an inequality in two variables:plot |x|^3+|y|^3<1Plot a region satisfying multiple inequalities:plot x^2+y^2<1 and y>xNumber Lines
