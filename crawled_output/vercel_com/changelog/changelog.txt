We've improved its performance by downloading parts of the cache in parallel using a worker pool.This decreased the build initialization time by 30% on average, reducing build times by up to 7 seconds for all plans.This is enabled automatically for all new builds and adds to the build initialization improvements previously launched.Learn more about builds on Vercel.+2Ali S, Guðmundur B, Janos S, Luke PSep 15, 2025Updated defaults for deployment retentionStarting October 15, 2025, Vercel will update the default deployment retention policy for all projects currently using the legacy “unlimited” setting:Canceled Deployments - 30 days, with a maximum of 1 year.Errored Deployments - 3 months, with a maximum of 1 year. Pre-Production Deployments - 6 months, with a maximum of 3 years. Production Deployments - 1 year, with a maximum of 3 years.Projects with a custom deployment retention setting will not be affected. Additionally, before October 15, the "unlimited" option will become unavailable when modifying retention policies.Team owners can configure a default retention policy to be applied to any new projects created under the team on

This policy can also be easily applied to all existing projects.Note that your 10 most recent production deployments and any currently aliased deployment will never be deleted, regardless of age.Learn more about Deployment Retention.+2Luke P, Marc C, Jay G, Matthew BSep 12, 2025Qwen3-Next models are now supported in Vercel AI GatewayYou can now access Qwen3 Next, two ultra-efficient models from QwenLM, designed to activate only 3B parameters, using Vercel's AI Gateway with no other provider accounts required.AI Gateway lets you call the model with a consistent unified API and just a single string update, track usage and cost, and configure performance optimizations, retries, and failover for higher than provider-average uptime.To use it with the AI SDK v5, start by installing the package:1pnpm i aiThen set the model to alibaba/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-thinking:1import { streamText } from 'ai'2
3const result = streamText({4
model: "alibaba/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-thinking",5
prompt: "What's your best argument for the health benefits of burritos?"6})Includes built-in observability, Bring Your Own Key support, and intelligent provider routing with automatic retries.Learn more about AI Gateway and access the model here.
