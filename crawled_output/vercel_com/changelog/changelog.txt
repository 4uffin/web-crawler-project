With Observability Plus, you have access to an expanded data set and more options for visualizing your Vercel data than was possible with legacy Monitoring. Observability Plus also allows you to save queries and visualizations to Notebooks to share insights and collaborate with team members.Monitoring will be sunset for Pro customers at the end date of their billing cycle in November.For Pro customers still subscribed to the legacy Monitoring SKU, we recommend subscribing to Observability Plus before their November billing cycle to continue to access custom queries on their Vercel data. Pro customers who have already subscribed to Observability Plus do not need to take any action. Learn more about authoring custom queries with Observability Plus.+3Julia S, Damien S, Timo L, Chris W, Malavika TSep 18, 2025AI code reviews by Vercel Agent now in Public BetaVercel Agent can now conduct code reviews, with validated suggestions that address issues across correctness, security, and performance.These reviews are fully codebase-aware, looking beyond the diff to any relevant files.

What began with the Qix compromise affecting ~18 core npm packages (chalk, debug, ansi-styles, etc.) has since spread:Over 40 additional packages attacked via the Tinycolor “worm” vector.The CrowdStrike / crowdstrike-publisher namespace was also compromised, with multiple trojanized releases.The DuckDB maintainer account (duckdb_admin) published malicious versions matching the same wallet-drainer malware used in the Qix incidents. No Vercel customers were impacted in that DuckDB subset.Link to headingImpact to Vercel CustomersWe identified a small set of 10 Vercel customer projects whose builds depended (directly or transitively) on the compromised package versions.Impacted customers have been notified and provided with project-level guidance.In the DuckDB incident, no Vercel customer build was affected.Link to headingWhat We DidActionStatusBlocklisted known compromised versions from the Tinycolor, CrowdStrike, Qix, and DuckDB-affected packages✅ CompletedPurged build caches for Vercel projects using those versions✅ Completed for impacted projectsCoordinated safe rebuilds with clean dependencies / pinned safe versions✅ In progress / completed for impacted onesRaised platform alerting & detection thresholds for new package publishes matching the Shai-Halud indicators✅ Elevated monitoring activeLink to headingWhat We’re Watching & DoingWorking closely with npm, open-source maintainers, and ecosystem security partners to track any further spread of Shai-Halud.Enhancing our supply chain defenses so that deployments on Vercel remain secure by default: stricter policies on lifecycle/postinstall scripts, lockfile hygiene, and registry validation.Tightening internal CI/CD controls and developer tooling to catch suspicious package behavior early.Link to headingRecommendations for Vercel UsersFor teams using pnpm, consider enabling the new minimumReleaseAge setting introduced in pnpm 10.16 to delay dependency updates (e.g., 24 hours). This helps reduce risk from compromised versions that are discovered and removed shortly after publishing.Audit your dependencies (direct & transitive) to check for packages from these affected namespaces.Rebuild with pinned safe versions and clean lockfiles (pnpm ci).Rotate any npm / GitHub / CI/CD tokens that may have been used in environments where compromised dependencies were present.Inspect GitHub repos for unauthorized workflows or unexpected .github/workflows additions.Enforce least privilege (especially in automated workflows), and limit lifecycle script permissions.Link to headingTimelineSeptember 8, 2025 — Qix / Tinycolor / core package compromise discovered.September 9, 2025 — DuckDB issue identified.September 15-16, 2025 — CrowdStrike / Tinycolor “worm” style propagation detected; Vercel detection expanded.September 16, 2025 — Customer notifications, cache purges, safe rebuilds underway.Link to headingReferencesSocket: Tinycolor supply chain attack affects 40+ packagesSocket: Ongoing supply chain attack targets CrowdStrike npm packagesAikido Security: Qix / core package analysisNx Advisory: s1ngularity attackAaron Brown, Tom Knickman, Matthew BinshtokShow moreReady to deploy?
