On Saturday, authorities released an affidavit stating he was arrested on suspicion of aggravated murder, felony discharge of a firearm, and obstruction of justice.Local and federal law enforcement descended on typically quiet blocks in Washington and nearby St George, banging on doors and closing off streets as they carried out a high stakes investigation.Outside the home tied to Mr Robinson and his parents in Washington, neighbours expressed shock that a fellow resident could have committed such an attack.'I will never let your legacy die' - Charlie Kirk's widow gives tearful address after shootingCharlie Kirk shooting throws Utah students into heart of US political divideWho is Tyler Robinson, the suspect in custody for shooting Charlie Kirk?How a college dropout from the suburbs became Maga star Charlie KirkWatch: BBC reports from house linked to Charlie Kirk shooting suspect"It shakes up a community because you don't expect it," said Addi Jacobson, 20, who recently moved into her grandmother's house in the neighbourhood.Ms Jacobson said she did not personally know the Robinson family, but her grandmother did."She just was saying that she thinks that, from what she's seen and what she knows, they're a great family, just regular citizens," Ms Jacobson said. "She used the words, 'very patriotic people.'""We knew their family. Our whole neighbourhood is so close," said another neighbour who lived around the corner. She asked the BBC not use her name due to the heated political and online conversation around Kirk's murder.She recalled Tyler Robinson "was a pretty quiet kid," though his younger brothers were more involved in community activities and sports. She called his mother, Amber Robinson, "an amazing parent," and his father, Matthew Robinson, "a hard worker". Both occasionally attended a nearby Mormon church, she said."That just even goes to show you can be an amazing parent, and your kids still just chooses what they choose," said the neighbour."This is a good family," Utah Governor Spencer Cox told CNN on Saturday. "A normal childhood. All of those things that, that you would hope would never lead to something like this. And sadly, it did."On 10 September,
Kirk was shot in front of hundreds of students and observers, and was later pronounced dead at the hospital. Videos of the carnage spread across social media, and President Donald Trump, Vice-President JD Vance, and leaders of both major US political parties condemned the assassination."If you thought that my husband's mission was powerful before, you have no idea. You have no idea what you just have unleashed across this entire country," the activist's wife, Erika Kirk, said in her first public statement on Saturday.Officials initially held two suspects but later let them go. On Friday, Utah Governor Spencer Cox announced Mr Robinson was in custody. His father had persuaded him to surrender, officials said.The night before, police vehicles descended on a townhouse complex in St George, Utah where local media reports Mr Robinson had an apartment.Sherri Steele, who lives across the street from the residence, came back from an evening walk to see a large police presence in her complex. In a video she shared with the BBC, a loud voice - which she said belonged to authorities - can be heard shouting, "Freeze!" and "Come out now!""It just kind of blows your mind, coming up the street and all the sudden there are helicopters above your house," Ms Steele said, adding she had never spoken or interacted with Mr Robinson.Another neighbour, 18-year-old Josh Kemp, said he had seen Mr Robinson leaving his house on one occasion with a roommate.According to Mr Robinson's affidavit, police interviewed a roommate who showed them messages Robinson had allegedly posted on Discord.The messages, attributed to Mr Robinson, discussed a "need to retrieve a rifle from a drop point, leaving the rifle in a bush, messages related to visually watching the area where a rifle was left, and a message referring to having left the rifle wrapped in a towel.""The messages also refer to engraving bullets, and a mention of a scope and the rifle being unique," the affidavit states.Utah County Attorney Jeff Gray plans to file formal charges against Mr Robinson on Tuesday, CBS News reported, and the accused will have his first court appearance that day.The nation - including the current occupants of the White House in Washington, DC - will be watching.But Washington, Utah will too."This whole time, I never knew that I was living next to somebody capable of something like this," Ms Jacobson said as she played in the park with her fiancé and baby.
"It just makes you kind of question how much closer am I to somebody else that could be this way?"Donald TrumpUS politicsUS gun violenceUtahUnited StatesRelated'I will never let your legacy die' - Charlie Kirk's widow gives tearful address after shootingTrump 'ready' to sanction Russia if Nato nations stop buying its oilMemphis mayor 'not happy' about Trump's plan to send National GuardMore from the BBC55 mins agoWho is Tyler Robinson, the suspect in custody for shooting Charlie Kirk?The FBI says a family member recognised the 22-year-old man from Utah from surveillance images released to the public. 55 mins ago3 hrs agoAfter fatal crash, Sikh truck drivers in the US fear blowbackSikh truck drivers say they've experienced an uptick in harassment after a fatal crash thrust them into the national spotlight.3 hrs ago5 hrs agoAnimal shelter workers hospitalised after FBI uses furnace to burn seized methFourteen staff were hospitalised and 75 cats and dogs evacuated.5 hrs ago10 hrs agoCharlie Kirk: Conservative influencer who rallied a youth movementKirk, an influential Trump ally who at age 18 set up Turning Point USA, died in a shooting while speaking at a Utah campus event.10 hrs ago15 hrs agoDonald Trump's UK state visit is next week - this is what we knowUS President Donald Trump and his wife Melania will carry out their second UK state visit in September.15 hrs agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
