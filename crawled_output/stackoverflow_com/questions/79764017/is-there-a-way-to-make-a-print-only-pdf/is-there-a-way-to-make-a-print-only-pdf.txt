Weird question: I would like to make a PDF file that is unreadable on a screen, and must be printed on paper in order to be read. Is this possible?
I suspect this is impossible because of the ability to "print to file" but I wonder if there's a way to produce a redacted document with an embedded hook that removes the redaction when the file is sent to an actual printer. I have looked at the PDF spec, and it's somewhat intimidating. Any ideas?
Thanks

I think that is not possible, once you make it in PDF file it is now digital which readable on screen and there still no technology that provides "Print to File" hook.
