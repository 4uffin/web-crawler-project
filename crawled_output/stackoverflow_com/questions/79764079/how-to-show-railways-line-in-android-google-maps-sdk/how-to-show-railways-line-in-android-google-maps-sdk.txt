How to show railways line in Android Google Maps SDK?

I am building an Android app where I want to display the actual railway line between two cities.
If I just draw a Polyline using the lat/long of intermediate stations, it produces straight lines between stations, which is not the real railway path.
Google Maps itself shows the railway lines, but the Maps SDK does not give access to that data.
How can I display realistic railway tracks between cities in my Android app (similar to what Google Maps shows)?
