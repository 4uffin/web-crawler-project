I've been following so many different tutorials, and none of them seem to work for me. Also, try to use so many AI models, but they also didn't work
What I'm trying to do is I have a series of events from a user, their activity, the location, and the time the event happened.
I want to be able to train a LSTM model strictly on the device.
I'm using TensorFlow to create a model, but I don't know exactly how to pass this data into it to train. Also need to use TF functions or save the inference train and load
Does anyone have any good examples that actually work? Or give me a high-level overview of how this stuff is supposed to work?

StackOveflow is not place for tutorials. You have documentation, blogs, and videos on YouTube for this. If you have some problem in existing code then show this code and FULL error message and then we may try to resolve this single problem. But we will not write all code for you.

Fair enough I'll post the sample code that has 2 variables that aren't discussed on Google's page.
And the error message tomorrow
