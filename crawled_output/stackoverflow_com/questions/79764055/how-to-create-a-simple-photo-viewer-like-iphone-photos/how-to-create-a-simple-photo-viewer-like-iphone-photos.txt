I can't get the InteractiveViewer to work as a simple photo viewer the way the iPhone Photos work. Basically, start by showing the image centered and fit to the screen. When I zoom in (via pinching), I should be able to pan the image all the way to the edge of the screen but not go past that. Pretty simple.
I can get the InteractiveViewer to center the image (by wrapping with Center and wrap that with Positioned.fill) and fit it to the screen (with minScale: 1), but when I zoom in and pan, the image always goes past the edge of the screen, so a portion of the background is shown.
Any tips on making this fairly simply task work?

Try this within InteractiveViewer:
boundaryMargin: const EdgeInsets.all(0.0),
In above code, setting boundaryMargin: const EdgeInsets.all(0.0) ensures that there is always at least a 0-pixel gap between the edge of the image and the edge of the InteractiveViewer widget, regardless of how much the user pans.
