I can't get the InteractiveViewer to work as a simple photo viewer the way the iPhone Photos work. Basically, start by showing the image centered and fit to the screen. When I zoom in (via pinching), I should be able to pan the image all the way to the edge of the screen but not go past that. Pretty simple.
I can get the InteractiveViewer to center the image (by wrapping with Center and wrap that with Positioned.fill) and fit it to the screen (with minScale: 1), but when I zoom in and pan, the image always goes past the edge of the screen, so a portion of the background is shown.
Any tips on making this fairly simply task work?

Try this within InteractiveViewer:
boundaryMargin: const EdgeInsets.all(0.0),
In above code, setting boundaryMargin: const EdgeInsets.all(0.0) ensures that there is always at least a 0-pixel gap between the edge of the image and the edge of the InteractiveViewer widget, regardless of how much the user pans.
Code:
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
const MyApp({super.key});
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
return MaterialApp(
home: Scaffold(
appBar: AppBar(title: const Text('InteractiveViewer Boundary')),
body: Center(
child: Stack(
children: [
Positioned.fill(
child: InteractiveViewer(
boundaryMargin: const EdgeInsets.all(0.0),
panEnabled: true,
minScale: 0.1,
maxScale: 10.0,
child: Image.asset('assets/ubuntu.jpeg', fit: BoxFit.fill),
),
),
],
),
),
),
);
}
}

I tried that, but that doesn't let me zoom out the image so it's shown in its entirety. 2025-09-16T00:38:31.353Z+00:00

I couldn't find the problem even without boundaryMargin: const EdgeInsets.all(0.0), in the InteractiveViewer on my Android device. I don't really know how iOS photos displays, but in the code I tried as stated in your question, I see we get panning when the BoxFit.fill image is zoomed, and panning just seems to limit the image at the edges - image boundary sticks at the viewer boundary. Isn't this you are looking for (because I'm not sure)? 2025-09-16T08:32:15.223Z+00:00
