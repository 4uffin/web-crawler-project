How make @JoinColumns conditional?

I have the following scenario:
class AId {
String aId1;
String aId2;
}
@IdClass{AId.class}
class A {
@Id String aId1;
@Id String aId2;
String aType;
// possible values are 0,1
}
@IdClass{BId.class}
class B {
@Id String bId1;
@Id String bId2;
String bType; // possible values are 0,1,2
@ManyToOne (fetchType="EAGER")
@JoinColumn(name = bId1, referenceColumn = aId1)
@JoinColumn(name = bType, referenceColumn = aType)
A aOfB;
// B will have an A only if bType <> 2
}
So if B={01,02,1}, I want to perform the join with table A to obtain A={01,03,1}
But, if B={01,02,2} since bType is 2, I know that it won't have an A element and I don't want to join when I fetch B. I am just unsure what the correct syntax is to achieve this.
Do I use @JoinFormula? But the examples that I've seen using @JoinFormula only relies on single column joins whereas in my case I need 2.

I am not sure what is the goal here - do you want to omit JOIN in SQL query entirely? Or you aiming to achieve any special JOIN condition? I could augment the query by using JoinColumnOrFormula and JoinColumnsOrFormulas

I want to omit the JOIN completely when bType=2. But if this is not possible, could you also share the syntax if using JoinColumnOrFormulas?

You cannot write query with conditional join like so
select * from someTable
when someColumn = 2 then join someOtherTable
so i don't know what you mean by "omit join for particular values".
However, I can give you idea, how you can augment your join statement using @JoinColumnOrFormula and @JoinColumnOrFormulas:
@ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.EAGER, optional = true)
@JoinColumnsOrFormulas({
// regular key join: bId1 -> aId1
@JoinColumnOrFormula(
column = @JoinColumn(name = "b_id1", referencedColumnName = "a_id1", insertable = false, updatable = false)
),
// conditional join: only if bType != '2', join bType -> aType
@JoinColumnOrFormula(
formula = @JoinFormula(
value = "CASE WHEN b_type <> '2' THEN b_type ELSE NULL END",
referencedColumnName = "a_type"
)
)
})
private A aOfB;
It produces following query
select
b1_0.b_id1,
b1_0.b_id2,
a1_0.a_id1,
a1_0.a_id2,
a1_0.a_type,
b1_0.bType
from
b_table b1_0
left join
a_table a1_0
on a1_0.a_id1=b1_0.b_id1
and a1_0.a_type=CASE
WHEN b1_0.b_type <> '2' THEN b1_0.b_type
ELSE NULL
END
where
(
b1_0.b_id1,b1_0.b_id2
) in ((?,?))
But i am not sure if that's exactly what you want.
