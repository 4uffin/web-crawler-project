Does HMAC(session key, primary key) prevent unauthorized access to sequential IDs?

I’m working on an app where each user should only be able to see and edit their own records.
My primary keys are just simple auto-increment integers (not UUIDs). If someone tweaks the request payload and changes the ID, they could try to grab another user’s data.
I can’t easily solve this with database-level checks, since the records don’t currently have a direct user-to-record mapping.
What I’m doing right now:
I generate a unique session key for each user session.
Each primary key is signed with HMAC(session key, primary key).
On each request, the client sends both the ID and its signature.
The server verifies the signature before allowing CRUD operations.
The user ID is also signed at login and included on future requests.
My question: Does this mechanism prevent unauthorized access to records with sequential IDs, or are there known weaknesses in this approach?
Note: I used GPT to help polish the wording of this question.

security.stackexchange.com/questions/127574/… is talking about URL, but the concern in the answer is similar. Whatever logic you use to generate the primary keys, that's your mapping. Maybe not user-record, but user-role-record and user-role-type-record is also common.
