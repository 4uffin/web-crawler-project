I launched a new e-commerce clothing store 3 months ago targeting urban 18–34 customers. Traffic sources are a mix of Google Ads (Search + Shopping), Facebook/Instagram paid campaigns, organic search, and a few influencer posts. Current monthly averages: ~10,000 sessions, 0.7% conversion rate (~70 orders), bounce rate ~65%, average order value ₹1,200, ad spend ₹60,000/month with CPA ≈ ₹857 and ROAS ~1.2. Users add to cart but drop off at checkout or during payment selection. Organic visibility is low for primary product keywords.your text
Launched Search + Shopping campaigns and several FB/IG creatives (carousel + short video).
Set up basic remarketing (FB pixel + Google remarketing tag).
Added 10% first-order discount, free shipping on orders over ₹1,000.
Reduced checkout steps from 5 to 3 and added trust badges.
Created blog posts and social content but with low posting cadence.
Ran one A/B test on CTA text and swapped product thumbnails.
Enabled dynamic product ads for cart abandoners.
Results: traffic increased slightly, CTR on ads is OK, but conversion rate and CPA barely moved.
Conversion rate to rise to 2–3% within 6–8 weeks.
CPA to fall to ₹200–₹350 and ROAS to reach 2.5–3x.
Reduced checkout abandonment and higher repeat purchase rate from remarketing flows.
