I encountered a compiler bug when using C++20 + Boost.ASIO in Windows boost1.89 & msvc17.6:
asio\co_composed.hpp(162,33): error C3546: '...': there are no parameter packs available to expand
asio\co_composed.hpp(163,2): message : see reference to class template instantiation 'asio::detail::co_composed_state_return<Executors,Handler,asio::detail::co_composed_returns<Signatures...>>' being compiled
Although this is a bug in the compiler, I hope someone can provide a modified version of asio\co_composed.hpp to circumvent this bug.
Detailed information:
https://github.com/chriskohlhoff/asio/issues/1545
#include <iostream>
#include <boost/asio.hpp>
#include <boost/asio/co_spawn.hpp>
#include <boost/asio/steady_timer.hpp>
#include <boost/asio/use_awaitable.hpp>
#include <chrono>
int main()
{
boost::asio::io_context ctx;
boost::asio::co_spawn(ctx, []() -> boost::asio::awaitable<void> {
std::cout << "Enter\n";
boost::asio::steady_timer timer(co_await boost::asio::this_coro::executor, std::chrono::seconds(3));
co_await timer.async_wait(boost::asio::use_awaitable);
std::cout << "Leave\n";
}, boost::asio::detached);
ctx.run();
}

The linked issue suggests that the problem existed with older versions of boost (1.86.0). The release notes include "Fixed an awaitable coroutine compile error with the clang shipped with MSVC." are you positive that you're on 1.89?

@sehe Yes, I confirm, I tested v1.87, v1.89. All have this problem.
