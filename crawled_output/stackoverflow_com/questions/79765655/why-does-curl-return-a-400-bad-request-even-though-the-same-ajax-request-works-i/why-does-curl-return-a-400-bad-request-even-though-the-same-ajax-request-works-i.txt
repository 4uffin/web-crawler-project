I’m trying to replicate a browser AJAX request using PHP’s curl, but the server always responds with HTTP 400 Bad Request.
Here’s my current code:
$headers = [
"Accept : application/json, text/javascript, */*; q=0.01",
"Content-Type : application/json",
"X-Requested-With : XMLHttpRequest",
];
$data = [
"param1" => "value1",
"param2" => "value2"
];
$ch = curl_init('https://example.com/api/report.php');
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, true);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, $data);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, $headers);
$response = curl_exec($ch);
$httpCode = curl_getinfo($ch, CURLINFO_HTTP_CODE);
echo $httpCode;
When I open the browser and perform the request via DevTools → Network, it works perfectly. But with curl, I always get HTTP 400.
I’ve tried:
Using JSON-encoded POST data.
Adjusting headers to match the browser.
Setting cookies from previous requests.
Question:
What am I missing? How can I make my curl request behave exactly like the browser AJAX request so the server stops returning 400?

You say: "When I open the browser and perform the request via DevTools → Network, it works perfectly.". Could you describe that with a bit more detail? Are you viewing an AJAX post call in the Network tab or are you just entering some URL in the browser's address bar?

You didn't provide details of the working request, or its code, so we have nothing to compare it to. But almost certainly the two requests are in fact different in some way(s) - e.g. different headers or different body content. Please edit your question to show the successful request's code. Thanks

There's no way for us to know what some unknown API requires. Your best bet is to contact their tech support to find out what's wrong with your requests.

The main issue in your code is how you’re setting headers and the body.
In cURL, headers must not have spaces before the colon, otherwise the server sees them as invalid. Also, if you send Content-Type: application/json, you must actually JSON-encode your data — otherwise the server will reject it.
Here’s a corrected version of your code:
<?php
$headers = [
"Accept: application/json, text/javascript, */*; q=0.01",
"Content-Type: application/json",
"X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest",
];
$data = [
"param1" => "value1",
"param2" => "value2"
];
// JSON encode because Content-Type is application/json
$jsonData = json_encode($data);
$ch = curl_init('https://example.com/api/report.php');
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, true);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, $jsonData);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, $headers);
// Optional: mimic browser agent, sometimes required
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_USERAGENT,
"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) ".
"AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) ".
"Chrome/120.0 Safari/537.36"
);
$response = curl_exec($ch);
$httpCode = curl_getinfo($ch, CURLINFO_HTTP_CODE);
if ($response === false) {
echo "cURL Error: " . curl_error($ch);
} else {
echo "HTTP Status: $httpCode\n";
echo "Response: $response\n";
}
curl_close($ch);
