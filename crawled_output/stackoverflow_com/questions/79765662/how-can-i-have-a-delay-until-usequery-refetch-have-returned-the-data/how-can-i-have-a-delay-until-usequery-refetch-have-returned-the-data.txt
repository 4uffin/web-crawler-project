I am developping an iOs/Android App with React Narive.
I am using useQuery (TanStack Query v5) to send the username and an hashed password to my database and it return the user ID if the email/password match.
How the problem occurs?
First I have this code which works. I defined enabled to false, in order to make sure that fetchUser() us not called while the View is loading.
const {data:user, isLoading, error, refetch, isFetching}= useQuery({ // Min 52 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpHq_-bPkGo
queryKey: ['user'],
queryFn: () => fetchUser(email, mdp),
enabled: false,
refetchOnWindowFocus: false,
})
Below, I have a button which call the function onLoginSubmitEvent
<View style={css.loginButtonSection}>
<Pressable
style={[css.loginButton, { backgroundColor:color.greenDark}]}
onPress={onLoginSubmitEvent}
>
<ThemedText type="text" style={css.textBtn}>Login</ThemedText>
</Pressable>
</View>
The function is called without problem, but the problem starts now.
The function onLoginSubmitEvent calls the function refetch() which will lunch useQuery and process to the authentification.
const onLoginSubmitEvent = () => {
console.log("cred: ", email, mdp)
setAlert("")
if ((email.length==0) || (mdp.length==0)){
setAlert("Vueillez remplir tous les champs");
}else{
console.log("1. Refetch")
refetch()
console.log("DATA: ", user)
}
}
My problem is that DATA return 'udefined', but if I repress the login button, I have all the data user that I need.
This is because refetch() did not complete it job while console.log("DATA: ", user) print the value, the first time. If console.log("DATA: ", user) print the requested value after I click the login button for the second time, it's because refetch() completes it job between the two clicks.
Include error message: "DATA: udefined"
Version and package
TanStack Query: v5
npm: 11.4.2
SDK: 53.0.20 (npm show expo version)
Expo : 0.24.15 (npx expo --version)
Expo routeur : 5.1.4
React Native: 0.79.5
Node.js v22.16
What I've tried
First
useQuery provides two options isLoading and isfetching. Correct me, of I am wrong, as I am refetching the data, I am concerned with isFetching
The idea what to create a delay with between refetch() and console.log("DATA: ", user).
Then I added while(isFetching) and I tried while(isLoading)
as you can see here
const onLoginSubmitEvent = () => {
console.log("cred: ", email, mdp)
setAlert("")
if ((email.length==0) || (mdp.length==0)){
setAlert("Vueillez remplir tous les champs");
}else{
console.log("1. Refetch", isFetching)
refetch()
while(isLoading){ //while(isFetching){
console.log("2. Refetch", isFetching)
};
console.log("DATA: ", user)
console.log("3. Refetch", isFetching)
}
}
Unfortunately, console.log("2. Refetch", isFetching) never print the string and sadely console.log("DATA: ", user) print
DATA: undefined
Second
I also tried to work with useEffect
useEffect(()=>{
if(user != undefined)
{
if(user.code == 1)
{
console.log("3. DATA_SUCCESS: ", user)
setAlert(user.message)
//getUser(user.id_user);
}
else
{
console.log("2. DATA_ERROR: ", user)
setAlert(user.message)
}
}
})
This works but if I uncomment getUser(user.id_user) useEffect is calling indefinitely
Third
I also tried this
const [isSubmiting, setIsSubmiting] = useState(false)
useEffect(()=>{
if(user != undefined)
{
if(user.code == 1)
{
console.log("3. DATA_SUCCESS: ", user)
setAlert(user.message)
//getUser(user.id_user);
}
else
{
console.log("2. DATA_ERROR: ", user)
setAlert(user.message)
}
}
},[isSubmiting])
hoping that when I changed the value of setIsSubmiting, it trigger useEffect, but without success
I might wrongly processed and I wonder how you would do to wait until all data is returned, depending of the network speed.
Many thanks for your help
