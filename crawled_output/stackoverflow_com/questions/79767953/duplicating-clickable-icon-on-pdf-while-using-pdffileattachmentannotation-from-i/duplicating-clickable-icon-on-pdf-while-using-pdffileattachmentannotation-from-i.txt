this is method where a new icon is being inserted into pdf using rectangle cordinates. But it creates two icons one with clickable to download the document and other just an image.
private boolean attachExcelSheet1(Order order, PdfDocument pdfDocument, PdfPage pdfPage, ByteArrayOutputStream excelFile, String detailLink) {
int y = order.getMajorVersion().getValue() > 0 ? 283 : 330;
Rectangle rect = new Rectangle(574, 204, 5, 5);
byte[] embeddedFileContentBytes = excelFile.toByteArray();
String fileName = detailLink + order.getOrderRevision() + ".xlsx";
PdfFileSpec fs = PdfFileSpec.createEmbeddedFileSpec(pdfDocument, embeddedFileContentBytes, null, fileName, null, null);
PdfAnnotation attachment = new PdfFileAttachmentAnnotation(rect, fs)
.setContents(String.format("%s %s", detailLink, order.getOrderRevision()));
pdfPage.addAnnotation(attachment);
return true;
}
