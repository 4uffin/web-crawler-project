I am looking for an effecient way to use AppLocker to lock down some PC's as basic Kiosks. We need some as kiosks, more or less, but the Multi-app and Single -App kiosks seem to be a lot more hassle than they are worth.
Is there a way to gather a list of apps that are running one a basic user setup, so that I can export it to XML for Intune deployment, or at least some way to simplify the process? I need to allow a few security apps to run as well as Edge, which I will lock down significantly.
If I can add clarifying info please let me know.
I tried using some Powershell scripting but as I am new to that, it isn't going well.
Get-Process | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Path | Sort-Object -Unique
Then:
Get-Process | Where-Object { $_.Path } | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Path | Sort-Object -Unique | Out-File "C:\AllowedApps.txt"
And it fails on this:
New-AppLockerPolicy -FileInformation "C:\AllowedApps.txt" -RuleType Executable -User Everyone -OutputFile "C:\AppLockerPolicy.xml"
