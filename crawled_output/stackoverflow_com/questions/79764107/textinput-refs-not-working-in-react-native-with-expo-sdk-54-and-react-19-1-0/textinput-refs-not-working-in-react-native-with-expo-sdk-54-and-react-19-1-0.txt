I'm experiencing an issue where TextInput refs are not being assigned in my React Native app using Expo SDK 54. The same ref pattern works perfectly in regular React web apps but returns null in React Native.
Environment
Expo SDK: 54.0.7
React: 19.1.0
React Native: 0.81.4
Platform: iOS (tested in Expo Go)
Problem
TextInput refs consistently return null in React Native, while the same pattern works in regular React.
React Native Code (NOT WORKING)
import { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, TextInput } from 'react-native';
const HomeScreen = () => {
const textInputRef = useRef(null);
useEffect(() => {
console.log("TextInput ref:", textInputRef.current); // Always logs: null
}, []);
return (
<View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
<TextInput
ref={textInputRef}
value="test value"
style={{ height: 40, borderWidth: 1, margin: 10 }}
onLayout={() => console.log("onLayout called")} // This works fine
/>
</View>
);
};
Console Output (React Native):
TextInput ref: null
onLayout called
Regular React Code (WORKING)
import { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';
function App() {
const inputRef = useRef(null);
useEffect(() => {
console.log("Input ref:", inputRef.current); // Logs the actual element
}, []);
return (
<div>
<input
ref={inputRef}
value="test value"
style={{ height: 40, borderWidth: 1, margin: 10 }}
/>
</div>
);
}
Console Output (React Web):
Input ref: <input style="height: 40px; border-width: 1px; margin: 10px;" value="test value">
Package.json (relevant dependencies)
{
"dependencies": {
"expo": "54.0.7",
"expo-router": "~6.0.4",
"react": "^19.1.0",
"react-dom": "^19.1.0",
"react-native": "0.81.4"
},
"devDependencies": {
"babel-preset-expo": "~54.0.0"
}
}
What I've Tried
Callback refs: Same issue - callback never gets called
Different timing: Tried useLayoutEffect, delayed useEffect
Component isolation: Tested outside of any wrapper components
Questions
Is this a known compatibility issue between React 19.1.0 and React Native 0.81.4?
Are there any Expo SDK 54 specific changes that affect ref handling?
What's the recommended approach for getting TextInput refs in this environment?
The component renders correctly and onLayout callbacks work fine, suggesting the issue is specifically with ref assignment timing or mechanism in React Native vs React web.
Any insights or workarounds would be greatly appreciated!

The code you've shared here appears to work as expected as far as I can tell. Here's a running Expo Snack. Perhaps there is more issue elsewhere on your end that needs to be debugged/investigated first?
