We are loading the excel file which contains large volume of data and trying to perform worksheet operations like delete or close operation in Excel Add-in. We have applied performance improvement related settings. Even after that also these operations are taking time for a while to complete and Excel is going into not responding state. Please help us to resolve this issue.
Excel.Application _excel = Globals.ThisAddIn.Application;
_excel.ScreenUpdating = false;
_excel.Calculation = Excel.XlCalculation.xlCalculationManual;
_excel.DisplayAlerts = false;
Excel.Workbook sourceWorkbook = _excel.Workbooks.Open(Filename: sourceFileFullPath, UpdateLinks: false, ReadOnly: true);
_excel.ActiveWorkbook.Windows[1].Visible = false;
sourceWorkbook.Close(SaveChanges: false);
_excel.ScreenUpdating = true;
_excel.EnableEvents = true;
_excel.Calculation = XlCalculation.xlCalculationAutomatic;
_excel.StatusBar = null;
if (sourceWorkbook != null)
{
Marshal.ReleaseComObject(sourceWorkbook);
}
GC.Collect();
GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers();

Interop.Excel, uses COM which is significantly slower than more modern technologies such as NuGet package DocumentFormat.OpenXml. It's unclear what your usage is, but Excel isn't a database and one shouldn't attempt to use it as one.

Why would you delete anything if you aren't going to save it? Even if you are planning on saving it, why manually delete all sheets when you could instead just delete the file?

@Itallmakescents, This piece of code is executing inside Excel Add-in. Does it take one week? Two weeks? A month? - This is not a fair question. Please ask in professional way. I have waited for 20 minutes and then excel started showing not responding issue.

@JeremyLakeman, In our app, we only need worksheet close method. As part of troubleshooting the issue, I have tried with delete operation as well.
