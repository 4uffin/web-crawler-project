I know that a simple R "for" loop like the following:
n <- 20
for (i in 1:n) {
print(i)
}
can be represented by a flowchart like:
However, in any set of flowchart symbols there is the "Loop limit" symbol:
which is described as the point at which a loop should stop.
I googled the "Loop limit chart symbol" and, though I found many descriptions of it, I couldn´t find any examples of its use. So I wonder if the following flowchart resembles the right use of such a symbol to represent the above given loop

There must be dozens (if not hundreds?) of programming languages with for loops, is there an aspect of this that is specifically R-related? This seems to be more about preferential conventions in flowcharts, which might be more of an opinion question. (Akin to asking if the oxford comma is correct or not -- it depends on what style guide you ascribe to...)

The for in R is rather a "foreach" loop. See this
