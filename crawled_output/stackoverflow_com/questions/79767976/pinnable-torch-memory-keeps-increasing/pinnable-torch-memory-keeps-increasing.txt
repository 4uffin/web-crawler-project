pinnable torch memory keeps increasing

This is a script I am using to test how much page-locked memory torch can allocate on my machine (htop shows 94.3 GB RAM).
import torch
pinned_GB_counter = 0
# keep a reference to avoid garbage collection
gc_blocker = []
GB_bytes = 1024*1024*1024
while True:
try:
input(f"Press Enter to increase the pinned GB counter from {pinned_GB_counter} to {pinned_GB_counter+1}")
pinned_GB_counter += 1
gc_blocker.append(torch.empty(GB_bytes, dtype=torch.uint8, pin_memory=True))
print(f"pinned GB_counter: {pinned_GB_counter}")
except Exception as e:
print(f"Ran out of pinned memory after {pinned_GB_counter} GB")
print(e)
break
Every time I run it, I hit a larger number before crashing. The error message is always:
CUDA error: invalid argument
CUDA kernel errors might be asynchronously reported at some other API call, so the stacktrace below might be incorrect.
For debugging consider passing CUDA_LAUNCH_BLOCKING=1
Compile with `TORCH_USE_CUDA_DSA` to enable device-side assertions.
The numbers I've reached (in order) are: 16, 21, 25, 29, 32, 35, 45, 56, 62.
Is torch.empty() lazy by any chance?
Is the OS "organizing" its page tables behind the scenes that allows me to page-lock more memory?
My expectation would be that the amount of pinnable memory by torch would be constant.
