For some reason i cannot place, i am sometimes getting 'type mismatch' errors when i run my app.
Important to note that the app is used in an observatory in the dark! If i bring the laptop indoors i cant seem to generate that error (i.e., the app works fine!)
I am the only user. After each observation is made, all its details are written/appended to a
text file and saved there, so data is not usually lost, but the app crashes and I have to relaunch it.
Can I stop this happening by trapping the error number (13) with an 'on error resume next' so the app may lose a small amount of data (but which I can re-enter) but at least it doesnt crash!
Many thanks.

It is certainly possible to avoid/trap this error. You haven't provided any details (the part of the code that triggers the error, or the values/types involved) so i am not sure what sort if answer you expect.

That's OK - it's a REALLY GOOD answer! Because you have told me it can be done, which is what I wanted to know.
Just a quickie... could I make a public declaration of the error trap in the form (there is only 1 form) or would it need to go in each individual procedure where it might be needed? Once again, thanks for a good, precise and clear answer!

If I remember correctly, VB6 doesn't have a form-level or global error handling; you will need to do in each procedure (although someone might correct me; it has been a while).
