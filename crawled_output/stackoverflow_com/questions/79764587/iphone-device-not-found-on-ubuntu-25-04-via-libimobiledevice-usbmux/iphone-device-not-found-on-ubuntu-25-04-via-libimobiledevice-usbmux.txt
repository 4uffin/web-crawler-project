I am trying to connect my iphone (ios 18.5) with my Ubuntu 25.04 system. I am using the original apple cable.
I followed the libimobiledevice tutorial to set up the connection. When i run
sudo systemctl status usbmuxd
it shows me that usbmuxd is running (active). I tried several times to restart usbmuxd, to reinstall everything and also tried another phone what i checked with
sudo dmesg | tail -n 30
and it was listed. sadly not my iphone. Even
sudo idevice_id -l
doesnt show anything
Is there any other idea to solve this problem? Also, i dont see the “Trust this computer?”message on my phone
