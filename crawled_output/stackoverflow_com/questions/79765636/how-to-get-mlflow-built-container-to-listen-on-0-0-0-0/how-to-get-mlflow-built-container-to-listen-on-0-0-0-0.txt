I'm following this tutorial and am stuck on step 8: https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/ml/getting-started/hyperparameter-tuning/#test-your-container
The inference server is listening on 127.0.0.1.
I want to set it to listen on 0.0.0.0 instead.
However, I can't find an easy way of doing this. Typically, I could set an environment variable or override the container image CMD or ENTRYPOINT. But MLFlow's container does not seem to have an easy way of overriding the network interface Uvicorn listens on.
I built this container following the tutorial's mlflow models build-docker command and it generates an image that has this ENTRYPOINT when I run docker images inspect:
"Cmd": null,
"Entrypoint": [
"python",
"-c",
"from mlflow.models import container as C; C._serve('virtualenv')"
],
Is there a prescribed or easy way of overriding 127.0.0.1 to be 0.0.0.0 when using the container built by MLFlow?
Thank you for your time üôè
