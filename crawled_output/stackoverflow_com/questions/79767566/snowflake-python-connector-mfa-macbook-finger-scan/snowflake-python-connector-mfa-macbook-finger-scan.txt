I have a personal Snowflake account on my MacBook Air (Tahoe 26 M4).
Snowflake is requiring MFA.
I added a passkey with a "nickname", which I'm not entirely sure what that means.
When I log into Snowflake on my MacBook, I am able to use my finger scan for my passkey for MFA.
When I run this python script:
import os
import snowflake.connector
sfaccount = os.getenv("ACCOUNT", default=None)
sfuser = os.getenv("SFUSER", default=None)
sfpassword = os.getenv("PASSWORD", default=None)
sfrole = os.getenv("ROLE", default=None)
sfwarehouse = os.getenv("WAREHOUSE", default=None)
sfdatabase = os.getenv("DATABASE", default=None)
sfschema = os.getenv("SCHEMA", default=None)
conn = snowflake.connector.connect(
user=sfuser,
password=sfpassword,
account=sfaccount,
warehouse=sfwarehouse,
database=sfdatabase,
schema=sfschema
)
conn.cursor().execute("TRUNCATE TABLE TBL_STRM_HRT_INC")
I get the following error:
snowflake.connector.errors.DatabaseError: 250001 (08001):
Failed to connect to DB: [redacted]- [redacted].snowflakecomputing.com:443.
Failed to authenticate: MFA authentication is required,
but none of your current MFA methods are supported for programmatic authentication.
I don't know what this means.
If I want to build a python script using the snowflake connector, can I not do it if I have a MFA passkey?
I'm lost on this and looking for any direction.
Thank you!

No you can't do it with a passkey. Here are the supported auth methods. You can set the auth_class to one of the supported auth methods.

Snowflake have informed me that my MFA method isn't supported for programatic authentication.
So I have to change my MFA method.

This has been resolved.
In working with snowflake, they advised me to set up key pair authentication. This documentation will help: docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/python-connector/…
