ESP32-C3 + 3× SSD1306 (I²C): second bus unreliable / freezes — which pins & best practices?

I've been trying to make a methane detector at home using a ESP32-C3 and 3 oLED screens,
Everything went well using one screen, when I added 2 more screens, then everything froze or just displayed nothing.
Here is the code :
#include <Wire.h>
#include <Adafruit_SSD1306.h>
#define SDA_A 5
#define SCL_A 6
#define SDA_B 7
// also tried 9
#define SCL_B 8
// also tried 10
TwoWire I2CA = TwoWire(0);
TwoWire I2CB = TwoWire(1);
Adafruit_SSD1306 dLive (128, 64, &I2CA); // 0x3C
Adafruit_SSD1306 dStatic(128, 32, &I2CA); // 0x3D (SA0)
Adafruit_SSD1306 dScore(128, 64, &I2CB); // 0x3C
void setup() {
Serial.begin(115200);
I2CA.begin(SDA_A, SCL_A); I2CA.setClock(100000);
I2CB.begin(SDA_B, SCL_B); I2CB.setClock(100000);
auto ping = [](TwoWire& bus, uint8_t a){ bus.beginTransmission(a); return bus.endTransmission()==0; };
Serial.printf("Ping A: 0x3C=%d 0x3D=%d | Ping B: 0x3C=%d\n",
ping(I2CA,0x3C), ping(I2CA,0x3D), ping(I2CB,0x3C));
bool okA0 = dLive.begin (SSD1306_SWITCHCAPVCC, 0x3C);
bool okA1 = dStatic.begin(SSD1306_SWITCHCAPVCC, 0x3D);
bool okB0 = dScore.begin(SSD1306_SWITCHCAPVCC, 0x3C);
Serial.printf("Begin: live=%d static=%d score=%d\n", okA0, okA1, okB0);
if (okA0){ dLive.clearDisplay(); dLive.setTextColor(1);
dLive.setTextSize(2); dLive.setCursor(0,0); dLive.print("HELLO A 0x3C"); dLive.display(); }
if (okA1){ dStatic.setRotation(1); dStatic.clearDisplay(); dStatic.setTextColor(1);
dStatic.setTextSize(2); dStatic.setCursor(0,0); dStatic.print("HELLO A 0x3D"); dStatic.display(); }
if (okB0){ dScore.clearDisplay(); dScore.setTextColor(1);
dScore.setTextSize(2); dScore.setCursor(0,0); dScore.print("HELLO B 0x3C"); dScore.display(); }
}
void loop(){}
Nothings display on the screen strangely.
Environment
ESP32-C3 devkit (Arduino via PlatformIO)
Adafruit_GFX + Adafruit_SSD1306
Goal: show live CH₄ PPM from MQ-4 + bar/peak/avg on OLEDs
Hardware
MQ-4 module:
heater @ 5 V,
AO → divider 57 k (top) / 47 k (bottom) → GPIO0 (A0) (ratio ≈ 0.452)
OLEDs (SSD1306, I²C, 3.3 V):
128×64 “live”
128×64 “scores”
128×32 “static” (should be vertical)
Intended wiring
Bus A (I²C): SCL=GPIO6, SDA=GPIO5
• 128×64 @ 0x3C (live)
• 128×32 @ 0x3D (SA0 soldered)
Bus B (I²C): tried GPIO9/10, then GPIO8/7 for the second 128×64 @ 0x3C
All OLEDs on 3V3 (V3); grounds common. MQ-4 heater on 5 V.
Symptoms
Each display works alone (0x3C or 0x3D).
With three connected, I²C often freezes (nothing renders / stale frame).
The “second bus” display on 9/10 (and later 8/7) is unreliable or not detected.
COM port quirks aside, root cause seems I²C stability/pins/addresses on ESP32-C3.

Probably nothing to do with the code. How long each of the I2C cable when you connect all three I2C displays?
