Are sys.stdin, sys.stdout and sys.stderr each singletons? It seems like they probably are, but I don't have a reference confirming so.

No, all three are of the same type (<class '_io.TextIOWrapper'>). So they can't be singletons.

@KlausD. Does that really rule them out as singletons? Can a subclass not be a singleton?

Running id(sys.stdin) seems to always return the same thing for me. Wouldn't that mean yes they are?

The definition I've seen for "singleton" is a class with only one instance.
Since they are all instances of the same class, then that class has at least three instances.
So, by that definition, they are not singletons.
