Should derived fields be sent by the server or regenerated on the client?

I’m working on an Android app (Kotlin + Jetpack Compose) that displays information about journeys.
The server sends all the raw stop details for a journey, but some values can be derived from this data.
For example, suppose I have this data class for stops:
data class Stop(
val stationCode: String,
val arrivalTime: Int,
val departureTime: Int
val km: Int
)
When the server sends me a list of stops, I can compute the journey time like this:
val journeyTime = (stops.last().arrivalTime ?: 0) - (stops.first().departureTime ?: 0)
Now, I’m wondering about best practices:
Should the server compute fields like journeyTime and send them as
part of the API response?
Or is it better to let the client app compute such derived fields?
Since they can be calculated from existing data anyway?
The data is not confidential or critical; it’s just convenience values (like journey duration, number of stops, etc.).
I want to avoid duplicating logic in multiple places, but also don’t want to bloat the API unnecessarily.
Question
What’s the best practice here? Should the server always send derived
values (like journey time), or is it acceptable to let the client
regenerate them from the existing data?
