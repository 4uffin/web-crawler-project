Has there been a change in referencing PropertyBusinessObject values in Codename One?

After months of capturing an object name from a PropertyBusinessObject value, referencing a database record and populating a record in a different database, as illustrated below in an Action Listener, getting the name object from the Activity List and using the name link between databases to build a Practice Plan, this evening the getter is giving me the error message listed below each time I try to capture and use the name and activity description objects from db 1 to populate the name action button and activity description Textfield in db 2.
mb.addActionListener(ee -> {
transName1 = ((addActivity) currentContact).name.get();
actta = ((addActivity) currentContact).activityta.get();
fltp = ((addActivity) currentContact).fieldtype.get();
pr.line3.set(actta.toString());
line4t = transName1.toString();
l4.setText("Demonstrate:
" + line4t);
pr.line12.set(fltp);
d.dispose();
});
"local variables referenced from a lambda expression must be final or effectively final"
My research this afternoon has not shed any light on the why my use of "transName1 = ((addActivity) currentContact).name.get();" now generates the error.
Does anyone have any ideas?

That has nothing to do with a change on our side. It means that you changed one of the variables and is a core limitation of Java. E.g.
void yourMethod() {
String transName1;
mb.addActionListener(ee -> {
transName1 = ((addActivity) currentContact).name.get();
// ...
});
}
This is illegal. You're changing the value of transName1. All values shared between the method scope (everything between the top level {}) must be final in effect. Java expects this to never change due to complexities in initialization.
The solution is to either move it to fields of the parent class or just don't change the values of the fields. Try to explicitly mark things as final to clarify the behavior.
