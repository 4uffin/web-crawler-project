In the following code typescript narrows the action variable differently between the if/else and switch examples. In the switch example the variable is correctly narrowed to never while it can still be { type: "increment" | "decrement"; } in the if/else example.
To me both variations seem to do the same so I am not sure where the difference is coming from.
A few observations, removing either the increment or decrement case from the switch will change the action type to { type: "increment" | "decrement"; } in the default block regardless of which one is removed. Also in the else block, the type of action.type is never, which I would have expected to be "increment" | "decrement" based on the type of action.
export const assertUnreachable = (_: never): never => {
throw new Error("Didn't expect to get here");
};
export type Action = {
type: "set";
} | {
type: "increment" | "decrement";
};
export const test = (action: Action) => {
if (action.type === "set") {
console.log("set");
} else if (action.type === "increment") {
console.log("increment");
} else if (action.type === "decrement") {
console.log("decrement");
// } else if (action.type === "decrement" || action.type === "increment") { // detected as duplicate
//
console.log("decrement");
} else {
console.log(action.type); // never
assertUnreachable(action); // { type: "increment" | "decrement"; }
}
switch (action.type) {
case "set":
console.log("set");
break;
case "increment":
console.log("increment");
break;
case "decrement":
console.log("decrement");
break;
default:
assertUnreachable(action); // never
break;
}
};

TS doesn't do full exhaustiveness detection on if/else the way it does with switch. There are various open feature requests about it, like microsoft/TypeScript#56527, and microsoft/TypeScript#21985. Does that fully address the question? If so I'll write an answer or find a duplicate. If not, what am I missing?
