I am having trouble configuring stripe test accounts. I have it setup and can accept and collect payments. But the pending balance is incorrect.
Amount
​
clearly my collected fees total over $11.62. For example on a $10.00 transation.the collection fee was $0.70 but my incoming balance said $0.11.
Is this just a stripe test error or am i doing/missing something.

This is probably a better question for Stripe Support to answer since it's related to how they calculate / display the balance.
