We have a repository in which the CODEOWNERS file is setup in a way that any commits involving files with .sql extension, will have to be approved by a member of the DBA group. All non SQL changes will have to be approved by a group of non-DBA developers.
Given this context, we have an open pull request with commits including SQL and non-SQL changes. The DBA team receives the approval request, and they review and approve it.
After their approval, a developer pushes another commit to the source branch, which dismissed the "stale review" of the DBA, even though there's nothing new for the DBA to review and approve.
How do we make GHE keep the DBA's reviews, as long as the subsequent commits have no SQL files?
