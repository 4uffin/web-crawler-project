I need to find a way for wxWidget to work with vsCode. I followed this guy github tutorial here : link-tuto. I also installed Mingw and everything I think I needed. The part where I get stuck is that vsCode never fint the includes needed.
error here

Looks like you're using tasks.json to build this? What's in there? Which flags are you passing to the compiler? For non-trivial programs you should really use a proper c++ build system like cmake, make, meson etc.

@iam_ai_copy-paste because SG questions get automatically posted if they're not reviewed, which is a moronic system.

IDE error you show means that you didn't add the include path to c_cpp_properties.json remember in the default mode of VSCode that you need to add include paths in 2 different places. c_cpp_properties.json is for IDE intellisense and tasks.json is for building. Also if I wasn't clear the IDE error has nothing to do with the building of this project so if you had build errors solving this likely isn't going to help.
