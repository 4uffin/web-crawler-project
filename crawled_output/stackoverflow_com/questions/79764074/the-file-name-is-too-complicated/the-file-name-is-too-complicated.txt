I am self-taught in developing Android.
While listening to several lectures, I noticed that the file name, class, and interface usage are different. If there is a file naming convention, I want to use it in a unified manner. What should I do?
I'm going to use it according to the MVVM pattern and the architecture recommended by Google. I want to organize the file names according to the purpose of data, model, viewmodel, ui, repository, etc. Also, I want to understand what class, interface, sealed class, etc. are created inside these files. For example, API uses retrofit to name interfaces and services. I would appreciate it if you could organize it like this.

file name, class, and interface usage are different Different from what?
Different from each other?
Well, yes of course they are different.
Filenames are different from class names.
I don't even understand what you are asking.

I don't know how to name the file according to the purpose. And I don't know when to use interface and sealed class.

The official Kotlin Coding Convention should answer the first question, and this Stack Overflow question answers the second one.
