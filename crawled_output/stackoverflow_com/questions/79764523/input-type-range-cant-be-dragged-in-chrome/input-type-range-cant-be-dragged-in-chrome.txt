Prevents dragging <input type="range"> slider with mouse when selected as text in Chrome
(5 answers)
Closed yesterday.
Sometimes in Chrome dragging the <input type="range"> slider doesn't work, the slider freezes.
I figured out that this happens when that DOM element is selected by the user, which often isn't obvious. Here's an example:
<div>
Triple click here, then drag (!) the slider
<input type="range">
</div>
How can I prevent this problem when coding a web page?

Undoubtedly, it's the same question, since a range input can be selected without text in just three clicks or with CTRL+A. It's also clear that in your example there's an additional parent element, and you're disabling the parent element's user-select; whereas in the duplicated question, the asker was specifically trying to select the input itself. I think your solution could serve as an answer to the duplicated question.

Setting user-select: none; for the <input> doesn't help, but you can set that rule for its parent.
Wrap the <input> in a dedicated <span> if it doesn't yet have a parent that shouldn't be selectable.
:has(> input[type="range"]) {
user-select: none;
}
<div>
Triple click here, then drag (!) the slider
<span>
<input type="range">
</span>
</div>

Although the @root's solution is nice, as it wraps the input[type=range] element in a separate span and disables selection on it, it doesn't prevent direct text selection. The approach is somewhat problematic because it would require wrapping every input[type=range] in a separate element, and it fails if this wrapping is omitted or not feasible.
Instead of wrapping in a separate parent span, you can simply apply user-select: none; directly to the input element and all its pseudo-elements, like this:
input[type="range"],
input[type="range"]::-webkit-slider-runnable-track {
user-select: none;
}
<div>
Triple click here, then drag (!) the slider
<input type="range">
</div>
It seems that adding -webkit-slider-runnable-track is sufficient.
Note: This provides a solution for mouse selection, but not for the CTRLA combination. However, it doesn't require extra JS code or wrapping in an additional parent element.
