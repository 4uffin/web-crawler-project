DD trace logs not structured in spring boot on startup

I am working on configuring a spring boot application to output structured logs.
Application Files
# application. yaml
spring:
application:
name: dd-log-issue
logging:
structured:
format:
console: ecs
//build.gradle.kts
plugins {
kotlin("jvm") version "1.9.25"
kotlin("plugin.spring") version "1.9.25"
id("org.springframework.boot") version "3.4.3"
id("io.spring.dependency-management") version "1.1.7"
}
group = "com.droidkfx"
version = "0.0.1-SNAPSHOT"
description = "dd-log-issue"
java {
toolchain {
languageVersion = JavaLanguageVersion.of(21)
}
}
repositories {
mavenCentral()
}
dependencies {
implementation("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter")
}
// DdLogIssueApplication.kt
package com.droidkfx.ddlogissue
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication
import org.springframework.boot.runApplication
@SpringBootApplication
class DdLogIssueApplication
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
runApplication<DdLogIssueApplication>(*args)
}
Run Configuration
The application is running with the Datadog agent found here:
Run the application with the agent
./gradlew build
java -javaagent:dd-java-agent.jar -jar build/libs/dd-log-issue-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
This works exactly as expected except for data dog logs that occur on startup. For some reason the DD logs are still being output in the default space delimited format.
Example:
... // Json formated logs from spring
[dd.trace 2025-09-12 16:52:59:590 +0000] [dd-task-scheduler] INFO datadog.trace.agent.core.StatusLogger - DATADOG TRACER CONFIGURATION ...
... // Json formated logs from spring
[dd.trace 2025-09-12 16:40:52:676 +0000] [dd-data-streams-monitor] INFO datadog.trace.agent.core.datastreams.DefaultDataStreamsMonitoring - Agent upgrade detected. Not enabling data streams because it is disabled by config
... // Json formated logs from spring
These logs appear on startup and I would like them to exist just not in a non json format.
