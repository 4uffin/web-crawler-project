I am running Nextcloud All in One behind an existing reverse proxy, OpenResty. Specifically I am using 1Panel to manage dockers.
compose.yml
# ignored options for 'all-in-one'
# --sig-proxy=false
# named volume 'nextcloud_aio_mastercontainer' is marked as "external" (used by service 'all-in-one'), so either remove "external" from volume definition or it needs to be created using: docker volume create nextcloud_aio_mastercontainer

The issue that I run into is setting the port to 80, 9000, 8080, 11000 all fails, either bad gateway or I am trying to access the container via an non-SSL port, which is odd since I am running this nextcloud all in one docker instance behind an existing reverse proxy and based on the documentation listed here:
https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/blob/main/reverse-proxy.md
I am getting it right. But what port should this be set to?
