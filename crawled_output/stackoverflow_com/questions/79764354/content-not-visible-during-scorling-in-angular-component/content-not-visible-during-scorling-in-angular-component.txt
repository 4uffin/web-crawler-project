In Angular, I have three components header, lefpanel and router-outlet for all other component data/page need to display. The initial component introduction have some contents, but only partial content is visible in router outlet others are not visible. The app component is
<div
class="container-fluid p-0 w-100 h-100"
style="
display: grid;
grid-template-areas:
'header header'
'menu content';
grid-template-columns: 1fr 3fr;
grid-template-rows: 1fr 2fr;
"
>
<app-header [user]="uname" style="grid-area: header;"></app-header>
<app-leftpanel style="grid-area: menu;"></app-leftpanel>
<div style="grid-area: content;overflow-y:auto;">
<router-outlet></router-outlet>
</div>
</div>
The introduction component (when we click About us tab) style is
.login-right {
background: #83648f;
padding: 5rem 10%;
overflow-y: auto;
}
While scrolling the partial content is visisble
Already I posted regarding this, i got some inputs but still not working for me.

your leftpanel component contains min-vh-100 and that thing enlarges the second row in your grid. 100vh means 100% of viewport. because of that 2nd row is rendered below the viewport.
just remove that class and everything should work as you expect
