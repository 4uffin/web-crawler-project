I’m trying to understand OOP abstraction in Python. Some sources mention data abstraction and process abstraction. Others talk about encapsulation being related to abstraction. In Python, I see abstract base classes and private members used to "hide" implementation details. Could someone clarify, with simple examples, how Python supports abstraction and whether these concepts (data abstraction, process abstraction, encapsulation) map to Python’s features?
Thanks in advance.

This not a tutorial service.
This site is for asking specific technical questions.
Asking "What is X" is too broad.
