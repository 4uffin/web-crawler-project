I see similar questions were asked by many people. After looking at their answers, my question is slightly different.
I recently installed MAMP web server for a class I am taking.
I updated the ports and have the http://localhost:8888/MAMP/ working. However, any project files I created in the root directory - htdocs or in a sub-folder underneath htdocs are not rendered in the browser.
Can someone help? I created a sample "starter.html" and when i type the file directory on the browser, it gives me a 404 error.
I have tried and updated the ports
I see that my html files open when double-clicked.
I can open them without an issue in Visualcode.
I verified the MAMP webservers are running
