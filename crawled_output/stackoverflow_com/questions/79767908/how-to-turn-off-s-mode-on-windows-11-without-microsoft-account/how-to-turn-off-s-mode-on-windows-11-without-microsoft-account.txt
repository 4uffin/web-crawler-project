I cannot create a system image because Windows 11 home edition is in safe mode without a Microsoft account. There are certain things I want to set up first before connecting to the internet.
I followed the instructions here: https://www.wintips.org/how-to-disable-windows-11-s-mode-without-microsoft-account/
The device encryption is off. I also followed the instructions on how to turn off S mode both ways:
Disable Secure Boot in BIOS.
Disable S Mode in Registry.
I was expecting to be able to create a system image but I'm getting the error:
This service cannot be started in Safe Mode (0x8007043c).
This is how I tried to create a system image. https://www.solveyourtech.com/how-to-create-a-system-image-in-windows-11-a-step-by-step-guide/

The only way to do what you want without a Microsoft Account would be to completely wipe the system and reinstall Windows. It is not possible to disable S Mode on Windows 11 without a Microsoft Account or by reinstalling Windows 11 Home. Why are you disabling Secure Boot in order to disable S Mode?
Secure Boot has nothing to do with S Mode normally.

"I cannot create a system image because Windows 11 home edition is in safe mode without a Microsoft account." The MS "system image" is very limited. Boot from USB, e.g., with Hiren's BootVD/USB or Ubuntu, and use that to image the entire drive.
