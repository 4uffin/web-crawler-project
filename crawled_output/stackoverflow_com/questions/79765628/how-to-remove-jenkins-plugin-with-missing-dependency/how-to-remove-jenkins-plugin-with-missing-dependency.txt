In my Jenkins instance, I have an error message that the Azure Container Services Plugin cannot be loaded due to a missing plugin, kubernetes-cd
I don't need this plugin so I'd be happy to uninstall it, but when I go to manage my installed plugins, the red X button that I would normally use to uninstall it is not present.
I went to try and install kubernetes-cd to see if that would allow me to uninstall ACS, but it seems like it's no longer available. I think I remember seeing that it was removed due to security issues but I can't find a reference for that.
Is there any way to remove this plugin from my Jenkins instance?

If you have access to JENKINS_HOME/plugins/ , maybe you could delete
o rename ( .old ) .hpi / .jpi plugin file
