We are integrating Amazon Redshift with SQLAlchemy and found an incompatibility when moving from SQLAlchemy 1.4.x to 2.x.
Problem
When using SQLAlchemy 2.x, our Redshift connections fail with:
sqlalchemy.exc.ProgrammingError: (psycopg.errors.UndefinedObject)
unrecognized configuration parameter "standard_conforming_strings"
It looks like SQLAlchemy 2.x tries to check the standard_conforming_strings parameter at connection time.
What we tried:
SQLAlchemy 1.4.49 → Works fine with Redshift.
SQLAlchemy 2.x with postgresql+psycopg2:// → Fails.
SQLAlchemy 2.x with redshift+redshift_connector:// → Still fails unless we downgrade back to 1.4.x
Question
Is there a way to use SQLAlchemy 2.x with Redshift despite the lack of standard_conforming_strings? I want to use latest
Can I connect with to redshift postgresql with SQLAlchemy latest version and using psycopg (postgresql+psycopg) or (postgresql+psycopg)
Can I enable standard_conforming_strings on AWS RDS side so my code would work? I don't want to bypass it
code:
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, event, text
# Database credentials and connection details
engine = create_engine(
f"postgresql+psycopg2://{db_user}:{db_password}@{db_host}:{db_port}/{db_name}"
)
# Set standard_conforming_strings=on if supported (PostgreSQL only, not Redshift)
@event.listens_for(engine, "connect")
def set_standard_conforming_strings(dbapi_connection, connection_record):
try:
cursor = dbapi_connection.cursor()
cursor.execute("SET standard_conforming_strings = on;")
cursor.close()
except Exception:
# Ignore if not supported (e.g., Redshift)
pass
# List of tables to query
all_tables = []
# Query row counts
with engine.connect() as conn:
for table in all_tables:
try:
query = text(f"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM {table}")
result = conn.execute(query)
count = result.scalar()
print(f"Row count for {table}: {count}")
except Exception as e:
print(f"Error querying {table}: {e}")
