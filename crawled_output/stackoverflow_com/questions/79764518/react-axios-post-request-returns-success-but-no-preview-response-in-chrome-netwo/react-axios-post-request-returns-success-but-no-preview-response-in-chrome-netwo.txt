React Axios POST request returns success but no Preview/Response in Chrome Network DevTools

I am building a signup feature in React. My API is working fine — when I hit the endpoint in Postman or cURL, I get a 201 Created response with JSON.
But in Chrome DevTools → Network tab, when I trigger the API from React, I see 201 Created in the Headers, but in Preview/Response it shows:
Failed to load response data: No data found for resource with given identifier
My Code This is for Sign up Request.
import axios from "axios";
import { useState } from "react";
export default function Signup() {
const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
name: "",
email: "",
password: ""
});
const handleSignUp = async () => {
try {
const res = await axios.post("http://localhost:3000/app/users/sign-up", formData);
console.log("Response:", res.data);
alert("User created successfully");
} catch (err) {
console.error("Signup failed:", err);
}
};
return (
<form className="mt-8 space-y-6" >
<div className="rounded-md -space-y-px">
<div>
<input
type="text"
placeholder="Name"
value={formData.name}
onChange={(e) => setFormData({ ...formData, name: e.target.value })}
/>
<input
type="email"
placeholder="Email"
value={formData.email}
onChange={(e) => setFormData({ ...formData, email: e.target.value })}
/>
<input
type="password"
placeholder="Password"
value={formData.password}
onChange={(e) => setFormData({ ...formData, password: e.target.value })}
/>
<button type="submit" onClick={handleSignUp}>
Sign Up
</button>
</div>
</div>
</form>
);
}
What I expected:
To see the JSON response in the Preview/Response tab in Network DevTools after the request succeeds.
What I got:
The request shows 201 Created in Headers, but Preview/Response says
Failed to load response data: No data found for resource with given identifier
Why is this happening, and how can I fix it?

The issue was caused by using a button with the default type (submit) inside React.
That makes the browser try to submit the form and reload the page, which cancels the request in DevTools and showing empty Preview and Response section.
Fix: set the button type to "button" so it doesn’t trigger a form submit.
<button type="button" onClick={handleSignUp}>
Sign Up
</button>
If you are using a
→ handle the submit event and prevent the default reload.
<form onSubmit={handleSignUp}>
...
<button type="submit">Sign Up</button>
</form>
const handleSignUp = async (e) => {
e.preventDefault(); // stop page refresh
// your API call here
};
