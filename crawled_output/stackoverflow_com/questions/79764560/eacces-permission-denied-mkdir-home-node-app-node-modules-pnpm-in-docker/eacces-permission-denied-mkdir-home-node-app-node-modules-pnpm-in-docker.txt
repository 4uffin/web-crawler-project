I'm a noob at Docker but I can't get my container to run and can't find working solutions on the internet or with ChatGPT.
For some reason, when I do docker compose up, It runs pnpm i again (also on another version than what I specified in the Dockerfile, builder does that too).
This then results in the following error:
pnpm: EACCES: permission denied, mkdir '/home/node/app/node_modules/.pnpm'
at async Object.mkdir (node:internal/fs/promises:855:10)

I tried to fix it by adding RUN chown -R nextjs:nodejs /app to the Dockerfile, but it doesn't change the outcome. Also as I said, as far as I am aware, it shouldn't even run pnpm i in the first place when doing docker compose up or am I missing something?
docker compose build is running fine and not showing any errors.
Does someone know what I'm doing wrong here?

Hello ncls! You are right, from the Dockerfile alone this should not re-run the install. Can you please also share your docker-compose.yaml so we can see what you are trying to do there?

@MichaelKrupp Thank you for your idea. Since I'm using the template of PayloadCMS, I didn't really pay much attention to the docker-compose.yml other than swapping out the database. Seems like they additionally added a command which ran pnpm install´on the latest PNPM version. The issue is now fixed. Thanks
ncls.
