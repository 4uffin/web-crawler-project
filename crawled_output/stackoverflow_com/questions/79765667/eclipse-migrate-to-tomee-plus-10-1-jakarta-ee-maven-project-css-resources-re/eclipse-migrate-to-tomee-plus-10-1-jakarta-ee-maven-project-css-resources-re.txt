I have a misconfigured project and have been unable to track down the culprit. Does anyone see the misconfiguration?
The browser console returns code 404 for all resources after appending ".xhtml" to the resource path and not mapping the virtual path 'jakarta.faces.resource' to /resources
GET welcome.xhtml
https://localhost:8443/Test/jakarta.faces.resource/default/css/tooltip.css.xhtml net::ERR_ABORTED 404 (Not Found)
The css file is added in the main.xhtml template for page welcome.xhtml
<h:outputStylesheet name="/default/css/tooltip.css" />
The project structure is:
src -
- main
- java
- webapp
- WEB-INF
- templates
main.xhtml
web.xml
beans.xml
- resources
- default
- css
tooltip.css
- images
The web.xml contains:
