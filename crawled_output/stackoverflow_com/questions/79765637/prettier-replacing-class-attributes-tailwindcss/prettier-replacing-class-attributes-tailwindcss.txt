Prettier removes single quotes when saving JavaScript files
(3 answers)
Closed 5 hours ago.
Prettier always replaces 'underline' with underline (without quote marks). There's a way to disable that behavior?
Result
<span
class="..."
:class="{
'hover:underline': !dragging,
underline: selectedCategory == categoryId,
}"
>
...
</span>
Expected Result
<span
class="..."
:class="{
'hover:underline': !dragging,
'underline': selectedCategory == categoryId,
}"
>
...
</span>
My current .prettierrc is:
{
"bracketSameLine": true,
"vueIndentScriptAndStyle": true,
"singleAttributePerLine": true,
"tabWidth": 4,
"htmlWhitespaceSensitivity": "strict",
"printWidth": 120,
"semi": true
}

Unfortunately: there’s no config option in Prettier to keep quotes around keys — it just doesn’t allow it. Same for 'hover:underline' vs 'underline': Prettier will only keep the quotes when the key isn’t a valid identifier (e.g. "hover:underline" must stay quoted, because of the colon).
This is a classic case of *“let Prettier do its thing, then let ESLint slap it back into the shape you want.
**Here’s the step-by-step setup:
1. Install ESLint + Prettier integration**
From your project root:
npm install --save-dev eslint eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier
2. Create or update .eslintrc.json
Add Prettier integration and the quote-props rule:
{
"extends": [
"eslint:recommended",
"plugin:prettier/recommended"
],
"rules": {
"quote-props": ["error", "always"]
}
}
plugin:prettier/recommended makes sure ESLint and Prettier don’t fight each other.
quote-props: ["error", "always"] forces all keys to be quoted.
3. Adjust your .prettierrc
Keep your Prettier config as-is (you don’t need to change anything). Example:
{
"bracketSameLine": true,
"vueIndentScriptAndStyle": true,
"singleAttributePerLine": true,
"tabWidth": 4,
"htmlWhitespaceSensitivity": "strict",
"printWidth": 120,
"semi": true
}
4. Run ESLint with --fix
After formatting with Prettier, run:
npx eslint . --ext .js,.vue --fix
This will re-add quotes around all object keys (including your Vue :class bindings).
5. (Optional) Automate in VS Code
If you’re using VS Code, add this to .vscode/settings.json:
{
"editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
"source.fixAll.eslint": true
}
}
Now every time you save a file:
Prettier runs first (handles spacing, semicolons, etc).
ESLint runs second (forces quoted keys).
⚡ Example before → after:
Input (.vue):
:class="{
'hover:underline': !dragging,
underline: selectedCategory == categoryId,
}"
After Prettier + ESLint:
:class="{
'hover:underline': !dragging,
'underline': selectedCategory == categoryId,
}"
