I like to add If-Modified-Since
to a .NET Web API built with Minimal APIs.
best approach should I need to take attribute filter or middleware? An example of the recommended approach would be really helpful.

You can implement it in your endpoint logic
app.MapGet("/api", (HttpContext ctx) => {
var lastDateModifed = // query db for last date
var requestHeaders = ctx.Request.GetTypedHeaders();
var ifModifiedSince = requestHeaders.IfModifiedSince;
if (ifModifiedSince.HasValue && ifModifiedSince.Value >=
lastDateModifed )
{
return Results.StatusCode(StatusCodes.Status304NotModified);
}
context.Response.GetTypedHeaders().LastModified = lastDateModifed;
var data = // query db for new data
return Results.Ok(data); });

It's depend on scenario, complex logic require middleware implementation for different controller,
above example I gave, it's about the method level check, you can use the attribute
