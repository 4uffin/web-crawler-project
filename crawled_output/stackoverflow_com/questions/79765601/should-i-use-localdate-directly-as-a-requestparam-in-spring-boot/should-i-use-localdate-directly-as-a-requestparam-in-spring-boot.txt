Should I use LocalDate directly as a @RequestParam in Spring Boot?

I'm building a Spring Boot REST API in Kotlin and I want to accept a date as a query parameter. My controller currently looks like this:
@GetMapping("/users")
suspend fun getusers(
@RequestParam name: String,
@RequestParam @DateTimeFormat(iso = DateTimeFormat.ISO.DATE) date: LocalDate
): ResponseEntity<ApiResponse<user?>> {
...
}
Here, date is a LocalDate, and I’m using
@DateTimeFormat(iso = DateTimeFormat.ISO.DATE)
so Spring can automatically convert the query parameter (expected in yyyy-MM-dd format).
My questions are:
Is it considered best practice to use LocalDate directly as a
@RequestParam?
Should I instead accept String and parse it manually inside the
controller?
I’m aiming for type safety, clarity, and maintainability, but I want to make sure this approach is idiomatic for Spring Boot.
