I am currently working on one client application of an Excel add-in using VSTO. Currently, the client machine must have the VSTO runtime installed for the add-in to work.
I would like to know if it’s possible to bundle the VSTO runtime directly with my add-in installer, so that the end user doesn’t need to install the runtime separately.
Can the runtime be embedded inside the add-in, or must it always be installed as a prerequisite?
If bundling is possible, what is the correct approach to do it (e.g., MSI setup, bootstrapper, ClickOnce, etc.)?
If it’s not possible, are there any alternative approaches to avoid this dependency?
My main goal is to simplify deployment so users don’t run into “VSTO runtime not installed” issues.
While publishing the add-in, I selected VSTO runtime as a prerequisite in the Publish Wizard. However, after deployment, the installer does not check whether the runtime is present on the client machine, and the add-in fails to load if the runtime is missing.
Expectation
When I click on .vsto url to download the AddIn on client's computer, It should first check the runtime availability if it is not present it should first load the runtime install it on client machine and then compatible with .vsto installation.
Can we bundle up the runtime with exceladdin if my application is downloaded as a .vsto link?
