I am trying to write a stored procedure to import CSV data from local system to mySQL tables. I do not want to use import wizard as I want SP to create, import and display time taken to import.
However, when I execute this statement:
LOAD DATA INFILE 'path/to/your/file.csv' INTO TABLE your_table_name FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' ENCLOSED BY '"' LINES TERMINATED BY '\n' IGNORE 1 LINES; -- Use this if your file has a header row
I receive Error Code: 1290. The MySQL server is running with the --secure-file-priv option so it cannot execute this statement.
Things I have tried:
Transfer files to path in secure_file_priv C:\ProgramData\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\Uploads\
Updated 'secure_file_priv'="" and 'local_infile'=1 in my.ini file at various locations, getting default file location from cmd, but the path is not updated when I check their updated values.
I restart mySQL server each time after making changes but no luck.
Unchecked Safe updates in mySQL preferences
Please let me know any workaround.

Yep, these are the possible solutions for this behaviour. If neither worked, then you probably made a mistake in implementing those solutions. Please show the exact load data statement with the file path C:\ProgramData\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\Uploads\ and what error message you got when you tried it.
