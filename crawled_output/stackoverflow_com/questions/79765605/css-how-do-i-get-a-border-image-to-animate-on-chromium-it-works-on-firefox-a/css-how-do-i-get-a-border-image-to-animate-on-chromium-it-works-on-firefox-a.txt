I am coding a minimal personal site and ran into an issue with a CSS "border-image" effect only animating on Firefox and Safari. On Chrome/Edge/other Chromium browsers, only the 4 edges will have any movement. I have tried using both GIFs and APNGs as borders with the same issue. I am looking for a fix or an alternative way to apply a border that'll give the exact same effect without warping the border image. Preferably a pure CSS solution. Thank you!!
Here is the animated border on Firefox:

Here is the animated border issue if viewed on Chrome:
Chromium animation issue
Here's the code snippet I am running into issues with. Using placeholder images for this post.
body {
background-color: black;
}
.bordered-pic {
width: 150px;
height: 150px;
border: 7px solid transparent;
border-image: url("https://i.ibb.co/C5gx5wfM/testfiregif.gif") 9 round;
-moz-border-image: url("https://i.ibb.co/C5gx5wfM/testfiregif.gif") 9 round;
-webkit-border-image: url("https://i.ibb.co/C5gx5wfM/testfiregif.gif") 9 round;
-o-border-image: url("https://i.ibb.co/C5gx5wfM/testfiregif.gif") 9 round;
}

Thank you for any help you can provide!

Use the gif as a background instead:
body {
background-color: black;
}
.bordered-pic {
width: 150px;
height: 150px;
border: 7px solid transparent;
background: url("https://i.ibb.co/C5gx5wfM/testfiregif.gif") 50%/100% 100% border-box;
}
<img class="bordered-pic" src="https://i.ibb.co/5hmzJCBL/pic.jpg">
