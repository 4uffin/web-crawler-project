I'm doing a simple document in LaTeX, and processing via pdflatex.
I start with:
\documentclass[a4paper,landscape,twocolumn,12pt]{article}
But it has a huge gap at the top of every page - that I've not been able to compress? What am I missing?

Use the geometry package's top option. For a more detailed answer, I recommend asking on the LaTeX Stack Exchange.
