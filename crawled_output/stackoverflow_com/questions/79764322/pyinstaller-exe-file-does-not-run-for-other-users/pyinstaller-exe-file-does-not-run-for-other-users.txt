I have a problem with Pyinstaller, when I build the program everything works fine, but when I publish files on github or archive.org and download from there, when I try to run it, an error

Python wasn't created to make .exe file and programs like Pyinstaller often have problem to find all needed Python modules or C/C++ libraries which will be needed on other computer. You may see many question about Pyinstaller on Stackoverflow. Maybe you should search on Stackoverflow if someone already had similar problem. Probably problem is edge chromium.

last line of error may shows problem with Python.Runtime.dll. Maybe it can't find it or this Python.Runtime.dll tried to load some other file (maybe other .dll) which it couldn't find (because PyIntaller didn't know that it has to add it to .exe and it may need to find out what file(s) it may need and add them manually to PyInstaller .spec file)

You can try doing a few things to avoid this type of issues:
Make sure your requirements.txt is up to date.
You can try containerizing your application and run it using docker.
These approaches are specifically designed to resolve such issues.
Let me know if you need more help!

I would say that it is good for comment, not for answer. 2025-09-14T23:02:03.383Z+00:00
