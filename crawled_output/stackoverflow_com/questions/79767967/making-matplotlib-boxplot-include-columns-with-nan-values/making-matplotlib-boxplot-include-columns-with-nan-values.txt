I've been trying to plot a data frame as a box plot using matplotlib. My data frame looks something like this:
9-1
9-2
9-3
9-4
9-5

Where every column is a day of a measurement. Below is what my plot looks like. I'd like to be able to plot every day in the box plot, including ones with NaN values. I know that matplotlib only plots the columns where there aren't any NaN values. Would this be possible to do using matplotlib or would I have to convert the data frame into a list of lists or Numpy array? Any help would be appreciated!
I know that there is a function in Pandas where we can put make a box plot using df.boxplot() or df.plot.box(), however, I strongly prefer to use matplotlib's boxplot() function instead. Also, I want to be able to plot the all of the values for days with complete measurements (like 9-1 and 9-5) instead of cutting them off to correspond to all the valid rows in the days with NaN values.
For images of the boxplot, https://i.sstatic.net/pBh6pEdf.png is what I produced and https://imgur.com/a/vvDFNR1 is what I'm trying to create with matplotlib's boxplot() function.
