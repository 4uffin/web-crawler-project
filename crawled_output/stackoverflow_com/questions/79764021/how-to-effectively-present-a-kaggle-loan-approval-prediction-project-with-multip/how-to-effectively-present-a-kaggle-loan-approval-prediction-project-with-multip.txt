Improve this question
I trained machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest) on the Kaggle Loan Approval Prediction dataset.
The Jupyter Notebook runs fine, and I already:
Performed EDA (distribution plots of applicant income, loan amount, assets, etc.)
Preprocessed data (handled missing values, label encoding, scaling)
Trained models and compared them with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
Visualized results using a confusion matrix and classification reports
Now I’d like to present this project (to classmates and in my portfolio). My notebook generates a lot of graphs (asset value distributions, confusion matrix, etc.), but I’m not sure about the best way to structure the presentation.
What I’ve tried
Exported plots into a PowerPoint manually → works, but feels static.
Considered turning the Jupyter Notebook into a PDF → not very engaging.
Looked into Streamlit → could make it interactive, but I’m not sure how to structure it.
What I expected
I’d like advice on the best practices for presenting this kind of project. Should I:
Use PowerPoint (with code snippets, plots, and explanations)?
Build a small web app (e.g., with Streamlit)?
Stick with a polished Jupyter Notebook (Markdown + outputs)?
Basically: What’s the most effective way to present a machine learning project with many visualizations and evaluation metrics to different audiences?

Please read How do I ask a good question?, especially the links in the section title 'Make sure your question is on-topic and suitable for this site'. So you are aware, you can use Jupyter .ipynb files to give slideshows. To see it in action go here and then click on the 'launch binder' badge and when the session starts up you'll be prompted to open the slideshow rendering of that .ipynb file. You can use Escape to get back out of it and see the content is from a .ipynb file. ...

<continued> This demo uses the MyBinder system to give you a
Jupyter session on a remote machine. This means you can use it without touching your own local system and without signing up for anything or logging in. Save immediately anything local you make back to your local machine because it is a very temporary session. If you cannot make your content public or need more computational power than MyBinder offers, this way you can try out the extension before you install it on your own machine to show your content.

as I remember Jupyter was invented exactly to easily share with others. So maybe share ipynb. Others will have interactive access to all data and code and they may test different ideas. They can run it on Kaggle, Google Colab (and few other sites) or on local computer using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab. As for me .ipynb can be the most useful for others.
