I want to reverse the direction of the slotreel, As of Now it is from bottom to top.
but when I am reversing the direction it is creating gap on the top feels like stretching it,
Below is the code snippet , consider slotItem as just any text lets say but the problem is when I am reversing the direction it creates gap at the top, My aim to stop the movement of reel smoothly after 9-10 seconds when I found the result like it can be any of them , so from bottom to top it creates illusion but from top to bottom , it could not and as a result it shows gap at the top, so what could be done , any other better approach please !

Please read How to Ask. "I want" isn't a question or a specific problem statement. What have you tried so far to solve this? Where exactly are you stuck? Or are you just trying to hand the whole thing over to us to fix for free, without any effort? It's unclear. Please edit your post if you don't want it to be deleted. Thanks.
