AWS IAM permission policy for EC2 instances access doesn't work

I'm new to AWS and I want to restrict access for a group of users to have full access to EC2 services only. Below are the steps I did:
Created a IAM group named "EC2 Admins"
Created an inline permission policy attached to the group as below.
{
"Version": "2012-10-17",
"Statement": [
{
"Action": "ec2:",
"Effect": "Allow",
"Resource": "arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:[MyAccountID]:"
},
{
"Action": "ec2:DescribeInstances",
"Effect": "Allow",
"Resource": "arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:[MyAccountID]:*"
}
]
}
Add a user to the group and login to AWS console with the user's credentials
However, I observed that the user is unable to access the EC2 service with error (For example: he is unable to view the EC2 instances under the dashboard).
Would like to seek advice on this, thanks.
