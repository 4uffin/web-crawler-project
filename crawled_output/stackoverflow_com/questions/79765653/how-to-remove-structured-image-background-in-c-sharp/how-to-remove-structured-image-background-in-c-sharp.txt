I haven't done this programmatically before, but I've done it manually in Adobe Photoshop and GIMP many times.
I'd suggest using your current modified image to find the bounding box to your receipt/text, then crop out the entire background of the original image using the bounding box. By "entire background", I mean finding the largest bounding box where there's absolutely no background or even trace of the paper edge.
Once you have the cropped image, you can run another process to clean it up. Since you won't have such wide ranging color values to work with, you can fine tune your contrast better.
I'm assuming you are doing this to pass it through OCR software, so you'll probably need better shapes on the letters for it to recognize the text more reliably.
It looks like you already have a good handle on the processing, so I won't go into that. You just need a 2nd version dedicated to making the text more readable, instead of finding the edges of the background. What you have now will probably work fairly well for that.

we're dealing with a (slightly) warped piece of paper, rotated, and viewed from a perspective. what manner of "bounding box" do you consider to be a bounding box? a general "quad" could fit this, more or less. that is still far from simple cropping. 2025-09-16T07:42:27.753Z+00:00

If the bill's bg color is always lighter than the background (Grayscale values), you could easily segment out the bill by using a chaincode in grayscale mode with a threshold of about 128. Then just take the largest contour found. Maybe increase the contrast a bit / or use a gradation curve / or threshold the result for better readability for the ocr sw you use. 2025-09-16T08:31:10.023Z+00:00

A different approach is to use a grabcut with a defined rectangle (it the bill is always in the center of the image) or set some seed scribbles at points you definitely know if that part is bg or fg. Maybe pre-resample the picture down to a size that's processed fast enough by the grabcut/graphcut algorithms, take the result, resample it up again and use that as a crop-mask to get that part of the original. 2025-09-16T08:31:38.773Z+00:00

Yet another way would be to simply threshold the pic ( colorchannel values: r || g || b < threshold) of about 128 to get a usable result. 2025-09-16T08:36:17.447Z+00:00

Bill paper background is white in almost all cases. Tesseract Single Page Segmentation Mode (code 6) recognizes text on white backgound. If background is structured, Tesseract PSM 6 returns random characters instead of bill content. Tesseract pre-processes image so maybe it is sufficient to remove only structured background before passing to Tesseract. I'm new to OpenCV/Imagemagick. I didnt understand how to use background removal code from referenced question answer. Where to find sample code to remove background? 2025-09-16T12:35:45.573Z+00:00
