Can we make a vertical InputGroup in PrimeVue?

PrimeVue offers a convenient way to work with an InputGroup, like:
<InputGroup>
<InputGroupAddon>
<i class="pi pi-user"></i>
</InputGroupAddon>
<InputText v-model="text1" placeholder="Username" />
</InputGroup>
Is there a way to get a vertical one? I would use it to let the user enter a function body so the InputGroup sets function foo(x) { as header, and } as footer, as in this StackBlitz, but where the header label appears on top of the TextArea, and the footer at the bottom:
<InputGroup>
<InputGroupAddon>function foo(x) {</InputGroupAddon>
<Textarea v-model="value" rows="5" cols="30" />
<InputGroupAddon>}</InputGroupAddon>
</InputGroup>
N.B.: I have also opened a feature request for this.
