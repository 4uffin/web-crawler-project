I'm trying to add generated files to a C# project created by CMake. I find that while CMake can generate a C# project from existing files, it somehow treats generated files differently. They are found in the csproj file generated, but not showing in Visual Studio and not built.
I tried to follow the process described here and in other threads: How to include generated files for compilation with cmake?
This works for C++ projects, the problem I see is only for C# files. This reveals itself e.g. when generating SWIG files for a C# module, which result in a cxx file and some cs files. (and this is my end motivation - add generated SWIG files to a build without naming them specifically - by reading their names from a file)
As a minimal example, consider a directory with only the following files:
NonGenerated.cs
using System;
namespace CSMinExample
{
public class NonGenerated
{
}
}
CMakeLists.txt
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.16)
project(CSMinExample)
# Enable C# language support
enable_language(CSharp)
# Define the C# class content
set(CS_CLASS_CONTENT "using System;
namespace CSMinExample
{
public class MinimalClass
{
}
}")
# Generate the C# class file
file(GENERATE
OUTPUT ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/MinimalClass.cs
CONTENT "${CS_CLASS_CONTENT}")
# Create a C# library that includes the generated file
add_library(CSMinLibrary SHARED
${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/MinimalClass.cs
NonGenerated.cs
)
# Set C# library properties
set_target_properties(CSMinLibrary PROPERTIES
VS_DOTNET_TARGET_FRAMEWORK_VERSION "v4.8"
VS_DOTNET_REFERENCES "System"
)
The resulting project in solution explorer looks like this:
And the project file has these items:
AFAICT the only difference is the location of the file, but there must be something else. I would appreciate any pointer on what I'm doing wrong, or how to debug this.
Edit
I'm using Visual Studio 2022, CMake 3.26
Edit2
If I manually remove the <Link> element from the <Compile> element for the generated class, it appears in the project. But how to control this from CMake?
