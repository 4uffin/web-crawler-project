Why is this slow
fibonacciSequence :: Integral a => [a]
fibonacciSequence = 0 : 1 :
zipWith (+) fibonacciSequence (tail fibonacciSequence)
-- in repl
take 10000 fibonacciSequence
but this super fast?
fibonacciSequence :: [Integer]
fibonacciSequence = 0 : 1 :
zipWith (+) fibonacciSequence (tail fibonacciSequence)
-- in repl
take 10000 fibonacciSequence
Context: I thought why not just add some abstraction at the basic level and then defer the determination of the type, be it Int or Integer, to whichever function that calls it.
PS - yes, I know that Int overflows really quickly (on my machine, at the 92nd Fibonacci number), but I'm just curious as to why introducing the abstraction causes such a huge slowdown.

Possible duplicate of Unexpected caching behavior using polymorphic records in Haskell. If that answers your question, I'll formalize the mark; if not, please edit your question with details about why not.

Also some interesting discussion at Is there an automatic way to memoise global polymorphic values in Haskell?.
