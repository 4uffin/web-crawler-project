I have an application (Ionic) that loads files into a Webview.
One of those files is empty, why is is empty is another thing I am looking into, however my issue is. as it is imported by another JS file, it causes a 404
So, I am trying to find out if the file is there, and the Webview is not loading an empty file, or, if the file is actually missing.
I have checked that is IS in the apk file, but I cannot be 100% sure it is installed onto the system (perhaps it is skipped because it is empty).
My question here, is I cannot find where the file are installed (on the emulator).
Some people sate under data/app,
but all I see here is
Under data/data I find the app, but it just seems to be data files, not the actual installed files.
I can understand perhaps a real device would hide these, however I would expect on the emulator, where we run for purposes of debugging we could some how see them?
