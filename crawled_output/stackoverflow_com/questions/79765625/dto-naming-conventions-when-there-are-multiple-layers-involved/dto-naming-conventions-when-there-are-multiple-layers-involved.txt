Say there are three layer for a create order end point:
controller
service
repositories
And for some reason, each layer requires its own DTO for requests and responses:
Controller: CreateOrderControllerRequest, CreateOrderControllerResponse
Service: CreateOrderServiceRequest CreateOrderServiceResponse
Repository: CreateOrderRepositoryRequest CreateOrderRepositoryResponse
Are these names a good idea for a naming convention for request and response DTOs?
If not, is there a better naming convention?

I would suggest three good practices:
Make them descriptive, understandable and consistent. All of which you are doing.
My final comment is make them immutable.

Consider the same names, but in different namespaces. Controller.CreateOrderRequest, Service.CreateOrderRequest, etc.
