I have a process that computes and checks the checksum in AIS messages, the checksum is the xor of all the bytes in the message expressed in hexadecimal format.
At the moment I am turning both the calculated and included checksums into strings and comparing them, which seems a bit compute heavy. Is there a better way to compare the single byte calculation with its 2 byte hexadecimal representation?
bytdata is the AIS message in a []byte{}.
j := i + 1
for ; j < leng ; j++ {
checkSum ^= (int)(bytdata[j])
}
checkBytes := fmt.Sprintf("%02X", checkSum)
if checkBytes == string(bytdata[(j+1):(j+3)]) {
// valid checksum......
etc
}

AIS checksum is one byte encoded as two ASCII hex character. you can parse these two and compare them directly instead of fmt.Sprintf:
import (
"encoding/hex"
)
j := i + 1
checkSum := 0
for ; j < leng; j++ {
checkSum ^= int(bytdata[j])
}
bytes := bytdata[j+1 : j+3]
msgCs, err := hex.DecodeString(string(bytes))
if err != nil || len(msgCs) != 1 {
return
}
if byte(checkSum) == msgCs[0] {}

You can do without string conversions here:
const hexUpper = "0123456789ABCDEF"
const hexLower = "0123456789abcdef"
// ...
var checkSum byte = 0
for ; j < leng; j++ {
checkSum ^= bytdata[j]
}
hiCS, hiByte := checkSum >>
4, bytdata[j + 1]
loCS, loByte := checkSum & 0xF, bytdata[j + 2]
if (hexUpper[hiCS] == hiByte && hexUpper[loCS] == loByte) ||
(hexLower[hiCS] == hiByte && hexLower[loCS] == loByte) {
// valid checksum......
}

Thanks for the suggestion, I think this is as consice as I can make it
if tst, err := hex.DecodeString(string(bytdata[(j+1):(j+3)])); err == nil && (int)(tst[0]) == checkSum {
