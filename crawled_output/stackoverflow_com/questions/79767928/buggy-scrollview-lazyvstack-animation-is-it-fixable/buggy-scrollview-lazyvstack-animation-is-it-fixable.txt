import SwiftUI
struct Item: Identifiable {
let id = UUID()
var height: CGFloat
var label: String
}
struct ContentView: View {
@State private var items: [Item] =
(0..<30).map { i in Item(height: .random(in: 80...220), label: "Row \(i)") }
var body: some View {
NavigationStack {
ScrollView {
LazyVStack(spacing: 8) {
ForEach(items) { item in
Text(item.label)
.frame(maxWidth: .infinity)
.frame(height: item.height)
.background(.gray.opacity(0.15))
.clipShape(RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 12))
.padding(.horizontal)
}
}
.padding(.vertical)
}
.navigationTitle("LazyVStack Demo")
.toolbar {
ToolbarItem(placement: .topBarTrailing) {
Button("Shuffle") {
withAnimation() {
items.shuffle()
for i in items.indices {
items[i].height = .random(in: 80...220)
}
}
}
}
}
}
}
}
#Preview { ContentView() }
The above code will render a list of items and a button to shuffle them and change their height withAnimation.
If you scroll down and shuffle it you will eventually see glitches in the animation, mostly consisting of ghost items animating on top of other items and disappearing.
Does anyone know why this is happening, and how to stop it happening? The issue goes away entirely if I use a VStack, but using a VStack brings its own problems.

You could try using Button("Shuffle") {
items.shuffle()
for i in items.indices {
withAnimation {
items[i].height = .random(in: 80...220)
}
}
}, to alleviate the burden on withAnimation
