Buggy ScrollView + LazyVStack animation - is it fixable?

The following code will render a list of items and a button to shuffle them and change their height withAnimation.
If you scroll down and shuffle it you will eventually see glitches in the animation, mostly consisting of ghost items animating on top of other items and disappearing.
Does anyone know why this is happening, and how to stop it happening? The issue goes away entirely if I use a VStack, but using a VStack brings its own problems.
import SwiftUI
struct Item: Identifiable {
let id = UUID()
var height: CGFloat
var label: String
}
struct ContentView: View {
@State private var items: [Item] =
(0..<30).map { i in Item(height: .random(in: 80...220), label: "Row \(i)") }
var body: some View {
NavigationStack {
ScrollView {
LazyVStack(spacing: 8) {
ForEach(items) { item in
Text(item.label)
.frame(maxWidth: .infinity)
.frame(height: item.height)
.background(.gray.opacity(0.15))
.clipShape(RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 12))
.padding(.horizontal)
}
}
.padding(.vertical)
}
.navigationTitle("LazyVStack Demo")
.toolbar {
ToolbarItem(placement: .topBarTrailing) {
Button("Shuffle") {
withAnimation() {
items.shuffle()
for i in items.indices {
items[i].height = .random(in: 80...220)
}
}
}
}
}
}
}
}
#Preview { ContentView() }

You could try using Button("Shuffle") {
items.shuffle()
for i in items.indices {
withAnimation {
items[i].height = .random(in: 80...220)
}
}
}, to alleviate the burden on withAnimation

This question is similar to: SwiftUI content jumping issue with LazyHStack embedded in a horizontal ScrollView in iOS 18. If you believe it’s different, please edit the question, make it clear how it’s different and/or how the answers on that question are not helpful for your problem.
