PySpark gurus, I need your help.
I have dataframe with column as nested array, like [[A, A], [A,B], [C,D]], I need your help to find out there are three pairs in total, two pairs not match ([A,B], [C,D], one pair match [A,A].
Please use PySpark.

for pandas I wound use df['total'] = df['data'].str.len() to count total items. And for pairs I would use df['pairs'] = df['data'].apply(lambda item: sum(x[0]==x[1] for x in item))

I don't use pyspark but I figured out df = df.withColumn('total', F.size('data')) for total value.

for pandas I had different idea for count pairs - using set() - df['count'] = df['data'].apply(lambda item: sum(len(set(x))==1 for x in item)) - and maybe set() could be used in pyspark with F.size() and filter.
