Does `git diff` pass down its own arguments to sub-commands?

Summary / Question
Does git diff pass arguments provided to it down through to sub commands (e.g. git grep) when invoked? For example, when calling git diff -G with an additional flag of -i as well (e.g. git diff -i -G "..."), it seems to be the case that the argument(s) from git diff is passed down to git grep even though there does not seem to be a mention of this behavior in the documentation.
Is this the correct understanding/intuition?
Could other arguments that are expected to be possible to be provided to git grep (for example) be provided to a git diff command and then be expected to be passed down through to git grep?
Details / Notes
Looking at the git diff command's documentation on/at https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff, there is no mention of an -i flag or option that can be provided. However, there is a -G option which is a mnemonic for grep (as noted in the git diff core documentation linked for it). Neither the documentation for -G or the pickaxe section of gitdiffcore/https://git-scm.com/docs/gitdiffcore mentions if/how any arguments are passed between the commands, if at all. However, upon experimenting, it does seem arguments (some?) are passed between the commands. How exactly does this behavior work/where is it documented? Is this just a feature bug/fluke?
Reproducible Example
I have the following Git command:
git diff --diff-filter=d --name-only --relative -i -G "MyKeyword"
When executed as is against a Git repository with at least two files involving the keyword:
file.js containing MyKeyword
example.js containing mykeyword
I get the following results (as expected):
src/path/to/a/file.js
src/path/to/another/example.js
When I remove the -i flag and execute the command against the same Git repository with the exact same files and conditions, I get following results (as expected):
git diff --diff-filter=d --name-only --relative -G "MyKeyword"
src/path/to/a/file.js
The lower case instance in example.js does NOT match/is NOT found, which makes sense and is as expected.
Standard environment disclosure:
OS: MacOS
Chip: Apple Silicon
OS Version: 15.4.1 (Sequoia)
Git Version: 2.49.0

I don't think that -G operates using git grep. There are no sub-processes involved. The documentation doesn't talk about -i. That is certainly an oversight. Or call it a "fluke" that it works as intended.
