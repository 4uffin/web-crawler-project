I am trying to wrap my head around this but it seems to be executing the entry point.sh script during the builder step and I have no idea why it's doing that. I am on a macOS M2 AIR using the Tahoe OS.
I tested this on my a M1 PRO running macOS 15.6.1 and it seems to be working fine. I have no idea why this works on one computer and does not work on another?
Any help would be greatly appreciated.
