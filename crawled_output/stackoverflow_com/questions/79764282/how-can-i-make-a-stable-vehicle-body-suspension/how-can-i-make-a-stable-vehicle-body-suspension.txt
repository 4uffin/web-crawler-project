Question
Hello, I think I had some physical engine problems when I was making a car game. First of all, I was making a car game with vehicle body 3d. But when I made it with the vehicle body 3d tutorial that I saw, the car suddenly bounces up when it closes with the ground. So I looked at the godot docs and followed them and the same thing continued. I would really appreciate it if you could look at the percentage of my suspension nodes and let me know what the problem is.
(suspension)
travel=0.3
stiffness=18
Maxforce=60000
(damping)
compression=20
relaxation=22
(wheel)
roll influence=0.1
RADIUS=0.35
rest length=0.15
friction slip=10.5
(rigidbody3d)
mass=1500
gravity scale=1.0

Like this, I set the node value. If you can help me I would really appreciate it.
Please refer to the photo I’m going to attach
I need a stable suspension but when the car closes to the ground it bounces back up. I hope it doesn't bounce.
