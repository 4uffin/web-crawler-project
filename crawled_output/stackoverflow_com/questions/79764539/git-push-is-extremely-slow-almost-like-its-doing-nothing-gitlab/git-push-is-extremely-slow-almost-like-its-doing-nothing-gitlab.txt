Git push is slow. Too slow. It's almost like it doesn't do anything... I'm editing my website and didn't make any "big" changes...
With the --verbose flag, it stays stuck to this line:
Pushing to gitlab.projectespresso.xyz:project-espresso/website.git
I'm not sure what to do honestly.
After a bit, it just says "operation timed out" and told me to make sure that I have write access when I'm the owner of the repo.
I tried restarting the servers (both gitlab and website) in vain. Thought it would've fixed the problem but nothing.
EDIT: I use SSH.

This could be an issue with your network, in which case this answer might help. It could also be an issue with your Git configuration or your Git server credentials, but it's hard to say without so little detail.
