Building on this question here
The term thread divergence is used in CUDA; from my understanding it's a situation where different threads are assigned to do different tasks and this results in a big performance hit.
I have also heard this referred to as warp divergence, here for example.
Does the use of if/else conditional branches effect the performance of CPU multithreading?

No, unlike GPUs, each (logical) CPU core has its own instruction stream.
On CPUs, there's no equivalent to a "warp" with a single instruction stream fed to different processors with different register values.
On CPUs, different loop iterations branching different ways is only a problem for SIMD vectorization (one instruction operates on e.g. 4 floats in a 128-bit vector register), not for parallelization with multiple CPU threads.
GPUs are made from many simple pipelines in parallel, which is great for throughput.
CPUs also have to care about single-threaded performance, so they have complex pipelines that try to extract instruction-level parallelism while executing a single instruction stream as-if each instruction ran serially (at least from the perspective of later instructions seeing earlier instructions, not from other cores seeing our loads and stores).
So sending more instructions per clock through the pipe is costly because it needs a lot of tracking (reorder buffer, schedulers, rename/allocate); current CPU cores are like 6 to 8 (instructions) wide.
(Zen 4, Lion Cove, M1 are all in that range IIRC.)
To get more work done per clock cycle in a CPU, SIMD instructions are still one instruction (or uop) for the pipeline, but with a wide execution unit and register file.
So we get more work through the pipeline without making all of it wider, just the real number-crunching parts.
See Modern Microprocessors
A 90-Minute Guide!, it's very good, starting from scalar pipelines up to superscalar / out-of-order exec, and has a section on SIMD.
(And the whole article really isn't too long and is very readable.)
Unpredictable branches are a problem for CPUs in general, though.
Modern branch predictors are very good for a lot of cases, but data-dependent branching based on random values in an array is often still a problem.
Branchless code can be faster, which is why compilers do if-conversion from branchy source to branchless machine code when they think it's profitable, especially as part of vectorizing.
(SIMD ISAs often have blend instructions, or you can emulate with AND/ANDNOT/OR, and SIMD compares produce a mask of all-1 / all-0 bits according to the compare result for each element.)
See
Why is processing an unsorted array the same speed as processing a sorted array with modern x86-64 clang? - C compilers auto-vectorize if (data[c] >= 128) sum += data[c]; these days so it's branchless.
gcc optimization flag -O3 makes code slower than -O2 - if-conversion (especially scalar) can make programs slower if the branch would have been predictable, especially when the compiler does a bad job and makes a longer loop-carried dependency chain than necessary.
