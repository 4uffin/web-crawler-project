Why does my Hermitian Covariance matrix can't be invertible?
I am following a paper that uses a Hermitian covariance matrix
and inverts it to produce a Fisher matrix. I construct my covariance as Gamma[i,m,n], stored inside a larger array of shape (n_z, n_k, ...

Why is Matrix Multiplication Slow During Pseudoinverse Calculation?
X, Z, YT = sp.linalg.svds(W, k=353, which='LM')
U = YT.transpose() @ np.diag(Z) @ X.transpose()
Where W is a sparse CSR matrix of size (124956, 124956). The matrix multiplication to compute U takes a ...

How to extract basis from equation for a lattice attack?
I have a problem which require lattice attack at some point to reduce work load but for most of use lattices are hard to understand.
I have:
k1 = (k0+x1)*const +1
k2 = (k1+x2)*const +1
k3 = (k2+x3)*...
