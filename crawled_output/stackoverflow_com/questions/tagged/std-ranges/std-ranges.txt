Do C++20 `std::views` store copies or references to their input ranges?
C++20 adds numerous std::views::... range adaptors.
When applied to a range, do they store a copy of the range, or a reference to it?

Here's the minimal example:
#include <vector>
#include <ranges>

Why do `std::views::adjacent` iterators increment all underlying iterators instead of using a more performant shift?
In C++23, std::views::adjacent<N> provides a sliding window of N elements over a range. Its iterator typically stores N iterators to the underlying range. When implementing this iterator's ...
