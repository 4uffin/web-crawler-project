So maybe I'm wrong about this but it seems that SSD's do not reset the Date Modified attribute of a folder if a change has occurred within that folder (file created, moved to, etc...).
Only HDD's seem to work correctly.
I've tested this on multiple Win10 machines with multiple SSD's and none of them seem to respect that the folder has been recently modified.
Why is that? Is it due to trying to limit write cycles?
On an HDD - Add a new text document to the folder.
In Windows Explorer, the folder date is modified to the current date.
On an SSD - not so much. The folder retains the old Date Modified.

It wouldn't surprise me if Windows/NTFS disables access time for SSDs to reduce wear without creating meaningful problems for users or to provide some benefits to Microsoft, such as funneling users to OneDrive when they discover inconsistent results in other services trying to use it for synchronization
This also suggests and provides some research that the setting default has been changed numerous times Is there any reason to keep the (new) default of LastAccessTime being updated?
You may be able to check the setting per filesystem via fsutil behavior query disablelastaccess .. see https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/fsutil-behavior for more options
