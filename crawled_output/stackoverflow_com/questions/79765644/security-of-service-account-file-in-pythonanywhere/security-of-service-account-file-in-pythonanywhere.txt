I have a PythonAnywhere Flask app that connects to Google Cloud API. I need to store the credentials somewhere. I've followed online suggestions to store the service_account.json file in the project directory and access it from the python code. However, since I deployed the app, I have noticed that my API use has increased well above what I would expect from a regular use of my deployed website. My questions are:
Are files stored in the project directory private or public (I.e. is my interpretation that someone found my API key reasonable)?
Is there an alternative secure way to store API keys in a Flask app on PythonAnywhere?
