When installing the fantraxapi python package using pip normally (pip install fantraxapi), it yields no errors. However, when trying to install it from a git repo, it has a modulenotfounderror for requests.
pip install git+https://github.com/meisnate12/FantraxAPI.git@master
Collecting git+https://github.com/meisnate12/FantraxAPI.git@master (from -r requirements.frozen (line 1))
Cloning https://github.com/meisnate12/FantraxAPI.git (to revision master) to /tmp/pip-req-build-xfx4i9d6
Running command git clone --filter=blob:none --quiet https://github.com/meisnate12/FantraxAPI.git /tmp/pip-req-build-xfx4i9d6

note: This error originates from a subprocess, and is likely not a problem with pip.
I'm trying to install one of the forks of this repo. How can I get rid of this error?

Have you tried installing requests first: pip install requests?

on GitHub FantraxAPI you can see file requirements.txt with all needed modules. You could download it and run pip install -r requirements.txt before installing module. It is popular method to install dependencies in Python projects.

just in case, I don't think this is a git question.

One way to fix this is to install the required library( i.e. requests here) in the environment where you're cloning.
pip install requests
and then use --no-build-isolation to tell pip to use your current environment (where you already have the requirements installed) instead of the clean build env
pip install --no-build-isolation git+https://github.com/meisnate12/FantraxAPI.git@master

This worked, but also had to install setuptools. Setuptools and requests were the only two pacakges that the install required. 2025-09-18T02:10:25.853Z+00:00

Yes, exactly. All the required packages have to be installed in the environment 2025-09-18T02:16:59.553Z+00:00

This specific repo requires requests and setuptools defined in the requirements.txt . So, when you use --no-build-isolation, you can simply check the requirements and install them all into the env 2025-09-18T02:23:09.71Z+00:00

The error ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'requests' is because a dependency for the install is not there. My guess is when installing directly with pip for the main version, dependencies are installed automatically.
Try running pip install requests in your environment before the GitHub pip install.

Did that work for you, because it didn't for me. You should try your solutions to see if they work before posting them. 2025-09-18T02:09:19.263Z+00:00
