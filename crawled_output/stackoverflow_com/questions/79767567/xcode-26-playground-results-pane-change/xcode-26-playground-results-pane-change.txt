Newbie here.
I'm just starting out learning Swift using Xcode Playground.
My Mac automatically updated Xcode to version 26.
Now the Results pane in Playground with this version is much more verbose and no longer lines up with the code.
Is there any way to set it so that it works like the older version?
The older version Results pane showed the value of variables/arrays/etc in the Results column across from line of code.
The new version Results pane shows both
the command and the resulting value, and no longer lines up with the associated line of code in the editor pane.

Not a programming question per se, but rather an IDE environment question.
I would like to know if it's possible to have Xcode v26 Results in Playground behave as in earlier version.

I grasp that you don't like this change, and I'm not fond of it myself, but I don't see what you are asking us to do about it. Apple has done this on purpose, and to judge by developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2025/247/?time=317 they seem rather proud of it. If you don't like it and you want to complain, that would be a feedback to Apple. They are not here; you need to use the Feedback Assistant.

I wasn't complaining.
Rather, I was asking if the was an option I was not aware of to go to the old way.
Specifically, I asked "Is there any way to set it so that it works like the older version?"

You could reinstall the older version of Xcode. It still works. You can even have both simultaneously.
