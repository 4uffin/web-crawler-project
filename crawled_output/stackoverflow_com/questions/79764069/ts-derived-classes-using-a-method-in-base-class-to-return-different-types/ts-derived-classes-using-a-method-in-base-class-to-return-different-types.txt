long time reader, first time poster :)
I have the following setup,
abstract class BaseUserList {
abstract getUsers()
getUserByUsername(username: string): User|DeletedUser {
const users = getUsers()
for (const user of users) {
if (user.username === username) {
return user
}
}
throw new Error("User not found")
}
}
class UserList extends BaseUserList {
getUsers(): User[] {
const users = []
// fetches rows in the userlist, parses the data and fills the users array with
// new User() instances...
return users
}
}
class DeletedUserList extends BaseUserList {
getUsers(): DeletedUser[] {
const deleted_users[]
// fetches rows in the deleted userlist, parses the data and fills the deleted_users array
// with new DeletedUser() instances...
return deleted_users
}
}
class User {
username = "foo"
last_active = "bar"
delete() {
//delete user
}
}
class DeletedUser {
username = "foo"
deleted_date = "blah"
restore() {
// undelete user
}
}
Now this works fine but my vscode is complaining about,
userlist = new UserList()
const user = userlist.getUserByUsername('foo')
user.delete()
Property 'delete' does not exist on type 'User | DeletedUser'.
Property 'delete' does not exist on type 'User'.ts(2339)
deleted_user_list = new DeletedUserList()
const deleted_user = deleted_userlist.getUserByUsername('foo')
user.restore()
Property 'restore' does not exist on type 'User | DeletedUser'.
Property 'restore' does not exist on type 'User'.ts(2339)
I tried playing around with
here and there but I couldn't find a combination that worked 100% :(

You'll need to make BaseUserList a generic type, so that you can declare getUserByUsername to return the exact same type of (element of) getUsers()

Thank you for your reply.
Could you provide an example?
I've been reading about generics throughout the day but don't fully comprehend it all yet... I've been searching for examples but none seem to exactly match my scenario, maybe I'm not using the right search terms.

nm the example, I re-read your comment a few times and think I got it, I added,
abstract class BaseUserList<T> then,
getUserByUsername(username: string): T and,
class UserList extends BaseUserList<User>
DeletedUserList extends BaseUserList<DeletedUser> All the vscode warnings are gone :)
Thanks again @Bergi !
