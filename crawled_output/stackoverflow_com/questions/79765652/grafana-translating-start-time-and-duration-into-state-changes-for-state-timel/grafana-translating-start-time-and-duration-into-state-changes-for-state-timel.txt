Grafana: Translating Start Time and duration into State Changes for "State Timeline" Visualization

I'm receiving data that I want to turn into essentially a semi-live Gantt Chart in Grafana - the State Timeline option looks like my best bet without messing with third-party plugins which I'd prefer to avoid if possible.
It's semi-live because I don't receive every state-change - I'm primarily dealing with timestamps that mark the beginning of each instance and the duration for which it ran. I've figured out how to transform that into an "End Time" - but I can't quite figure out how to turn that into On/Off States.
In Short: How do I use "Start Time", "Duration", and/or "End Time" to create States for each Module that I can use in Grafana's State Timeline visualization?
In Long:
I'm receiving a series of "Modules" that each belong to a "Set". Each Set consists of one or more Modules and the Set is itself treated as a Module which I need to account for. The Modules each have a type and can run concurrently with each other - Sets can also run concurrently although aren't likely to do so. The Sets may not start/stop at the same time as their first/final Module, but the runtimes of the Modules will always be within the runtime of the Set.
Each piece of data I receive is the data for an entire module's run and consists of
Module ID (Unique per module run)
Set ID (All modules belonging to a set share the same Set ID)
Module Type (There are a few different types; I want to be able to distinguish what type they are, but the most important distinction is whether or not it's a "Set")
Set
Alpha
Bravo
etc...
Start Time (acting as the Timestamp for Grafana)
Duration
...and I'm using a Transform to get the End Time for each module from the Start Time & Duration.
This is essentially what I'm looking to get:
(Forgive my MSPaint graph; I'm working with what I've got!)
I realize that the timeline can get cluttered; the intent is mostly to collect the data and view only small portions of the timeline at once, or filter it down to only show one Set and it's associated modules at a time. I know how to go about doing that, but how to get the data into this visualization format is escaping me - I feel like I have all the information I should need in order to do it, but can't figure out how to create the necessary "State-Change" with it.
Is this doable?
