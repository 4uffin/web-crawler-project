Svelte Store caching in development server?

I'm using Vite and plain Svelte for an SPA App I'm currently developing. One thing I noticed and is bothering me so far is that svelte store is being cached sometimes even after reload.
This isn't happening at all in production, only in dev server.
I have a parent component that displays the store values and the child components that update it. Whenever an "update" is called on a new page, Svelte is retriving ALL the old values unless I do a hard reload.
Is there something I'm missing or is this normal behaviour that should be somehow handled?
