Rope jitter animation when using rope joints in @react-three/rapier

I’m building a card-swinging effect using @react-three/rapier. I created a rope by chaining rigid bodies with useRopeJoint, but the free end of the rope jitters noticeably. Even if I disconnect the rope from the card, the rope end still shakes. Increasing solver iterations and adding damping reduces but doesn’t eliminate the issue.
How can I reduce or eliminate the jitter at the free end of the rope? am I setting up the joints incorrectly?
Here's my code;
import { Canvas } from "@react-three/fiber";
import { Physics, RigidBody, useRopeJoint } from "@react-three/rapier";
import { Suspense, useRef } from "react";
function RopeExample() {
const fixed = useRef(null);
const j1 = useRef(null);
const j2 = useRef(null);
const j3 = useRef(null);
// Rope joints
useRopeJoint(fixed, j1, [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], 0.7]);
useRopeJoint(j1, j2, [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], 0.7]);
useRopeJoint(j2, j3, [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], 0.7]);
return (
<>
<RigidBody type="fixed" ref={fixed}>
<mesh position={[0, 6, 0]}>
<sphereGeometry args={[0.1]} />
<meshStandardMaterial color="red" />
</mesh>
</RigidBody>
<RigidBody ref={j1}>
<mesh position={[0, 5, 0]}>
<sphereGeometry args={[0.1]} />
<meshStandardMaterial color="blue" />
</mesh>
</RigidBody>
<RigidBody ref={j2}>
<mesh position={[0, 4, 0]}>
<sphereGeometry args={[0.1]} />
<meshStandardMaterial color="green" />
</mesh>
</RigidBody>
<RigidBody ref={j3}>
<mesh position={[0, 3, 0]}>
<sphereGeometry args={[0.1]} />
<meshStandardMaterial color="yellow" />
</mesh>
</RigidBody>
</>
);
}
export default function App() {
return (
<Canvas camera={{ position: [0, 5, 10], fov: 50 }}>
<ambientLight />
<Suspense fallback={null}>
<Physics numSolverIterations={40} gravity={[0, -9.81, 0]}>
<RopeExample />
</Physics>
</Suspense>
</Canvas>
);
}
Increased numSolverIterations up to 80.
Added linearDamping and angularDamping to rope bodies.
Disconnected the card completely → rope end still jitters.
