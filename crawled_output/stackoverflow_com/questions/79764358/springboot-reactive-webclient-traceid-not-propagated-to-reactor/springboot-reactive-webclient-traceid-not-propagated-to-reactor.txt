SpringBoot Reactive (Webclient) - TraceId not propagated to reactor?
Ask Question

I'm working on a Spring Boot application using Spring WebFlux with reactive WebClient and Micrometer for tracing. While tracing works correctly in the imperative (servlet) stack, the trace context (traceId, spanId) is lost when the execution moves to the reactive stack (Project Reactor threads). This results in missing traceId and spanId values in log files.
Configuration:
spring.reactor.context-propagation=auto
log pattern
%d %-5level %-50.50logger{50} [%thread,%X{traceId:-},%X{spanId:-}] %msg%n
Log Output Example:
2025-09-14 15:59:20,064 TRACE o.s.web.reactive.function.client.ExchangeFunctions [http-nio-8080-exec-1,68c6ca3839216185f4ca70c9a8ee1823,a98bd42951d46230] [774c1457] HTTP GET https://httpbin.org/get, headers={masked}

As you can see, once execution moves to reactor threads (reactor-http-epoll-3), the traceId and spanId become empty.
I've created a minimal reproduction case: https://github.com/cyrillzadra/spring-reactor-tracing-logging-demo
Demo Setup
Spring Boot: 3.x
Spring WebFlux: Reactive stack
Micrometer Tracing
Logging: Logback with MDC
What's the recommended way to ensure traceId/spanId propagate to reactive threads?
Any help or guidance would be greatly appreciated!

Try adding micrometer-tracing-bridge-brave or micrometer-tracing-bridge-otel
Micrometer supports multiple tracing implementations. Ensure you include one of them.
For Brave Zipkin:
<dependency>
<groupId>io.micrometer</groupId>
<artifactId>micrometer-tracing-bridge-brave</artifactId>
</dependency>
For Opentelemetry:
<dependency>
<groupId>io.micrometer</groupId>
<artifactId>micrometer-tracing-bridge-otel</artifactId>
</dependency>
And enable : spring.reactor.context-propagation=enabled
And also use ObservationThreadLocalAccessor and ObservationContext properly.
Spring Boot 3.x uses Observation API, which can propagate context safely across threads if configured.
Make sure you are using:
<dependency>
<groupId>io.micrometer</groupId>
<artifactId>micrometer-observation</artifactId>
</dependency>
Spring Boot’s autoconfiguration usually does this for you when you include the tracing starter:
<dependency>
<groupId>io.micrometer</groupId>
<artifactId>micrometer-tracing</artifactId>
</dependency>
Micrometer’s tracing bridge should automatically populate MDC if configured.
Add this to logback.xml:
<property name="LOG_PATTERN" value="%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS} %-5level %logger{36} [%thread,%X{traceId:-},%X{spanId:-}] %msg%n"/>
<appender name="STDOUT" class="ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender">
<encoder>
<pattern>${LOG_PATTERN}</pattern>
</encoder>
</appender>
Make sure that:
traceId and spanId are supported by the bridge you're using.
You don’t manually override them elsewhere.
There are other ways to configure also need to explored based on requirement.

Thanks for your feedback. I also tried micrometer-tracing-bridge-otel but same problem. It seems some log output contains traceId and some do not. 2025-09-15T12:27:35.887Z+00:00
