f-string representation different than str()
(2 answers)
Closed 23 hours ago.
This post was edited and submitted for review 14 hours ago.
I wrote a subclass of Decimal to represent an amount of money. I wrote a custom __str__ to display the currency along with a sign format. My method works when calling str() but in a f-string somehow my custom __str__ is not used. What is happening here?
My goal is to have my custom __str__ being used in f-string situations. I'm also interested in understanding what is happening here. Something is going on that defies my current understanding of
__str__, __format__ and inheritance. I thought the default behavior of format with no format specified was to delegate to str, but here it sends it to str of the parent class instead.
Here is the minimal code to reproduce:
from decimal import Decimal
class Money(Decimal):
CURRENCY = "€"
def __new__(cls, number):
return super().__new__(cls, Decimal(number).quantize(Decimal("0.01")))
def __str__(self):
return f"{self:+}{self.CURRENCY}"
m = Money(10)
print("Test 1 - str():", str(m))
print("Test 2 - print():", m)
print(f"Test 3 - f-string: {m}")
print("Test 4 - f-string str():", f"{str(m)}")
This results in
Test 1 - str(): +10.00€
Test 2 - print(): +10.00€
Test 3 - f-string: 10.00 # only here is my custom str not called
Test 4 - f-string str(): +10.00€
Python version is 3.13.7.

Side note, you probably want to use composition over inheritance. Any method that you do not explicitly override will return a Decimal object rather than a Money object. This can be a pernicious source of bugs, as you might forget to override a less well known method of Decimal. Even operations as simple as +Money(0) will result in a Decimal object. See also methods (eg. Money(0).quantize(Money(0))), and implied operations (eg. round(Money(0), 3)) as well.

f-strings in Python prioritize __format__ over __str__. Since Money inherits from Decimal, you need to add __format__ to your class for expected behavior.
from decimal import Decimal
class Money(Decimal):
CURRENCY = "€"
def __new__(cls, number):
return super().__new__(cls, Decimal(number).quantize(Decimal("0.01")))
def __format__(self, format_spec: str) -> str:
if not format_spec:
format_spec = "+.2f"
formatted_number = super().__format__(format_spec)
return f"{formatted_number}{self.CURRENCY}"
def __str__(self) -> str:
formatted_number = super().__format__("+.2f")
return f"{formatted_number}{self.CURRENCY}"

The __format__ method is not meant to be called explicitly as pointed out in this post
I would suggest:
from decimal import Decimal
class Money(Decimal):
QUANT = Decimal("0.01")
FORMAT = "+.2f"
def __new__(cls, number):
return super().__new__(cls, Decimal(number).quantize(Money.QUANT))
def __format__(self, format_spec):
return super().__format__(format_spec or Money.FORMAT) + "€"
def __str__(self):
return f"{self:{Money.FORMAT}}"
money = Money("1.123")
print(f"{money}")
print(f"{money:+.4f}")
print(money)
Output:
+1.12€
+1.1200€
+1.12€

First, you should know the whole process
F-strings use __format__() method, not directly __str__()
When __format__() is not defined, Python falls back to str()
If a parent class defines __format__(), it takes precedence over the subclass's __str__()
Use !s specifier to force string conversion: f"{obj!s}"
The most robust solution is to override __format__() in your subclass
So you can use these solutions to fix your problem
Override __format__ method
class Parent:
def __str__(self):
return "Parent string"
def __format__(self, format_spec):
return str(self)
class Child(Parent):
def __str__(self):
return "Child string"
def __format__(self, format_spec):
return str(self)
# This ensures __str__ is called
# Test
child = Child()
print(f"{child}")
# Output: Child string

But this doesn't facilitate any kind of formatting. For example print(f"{child:>16}") 2025-09-15T14:29:26.707Z+00:00
