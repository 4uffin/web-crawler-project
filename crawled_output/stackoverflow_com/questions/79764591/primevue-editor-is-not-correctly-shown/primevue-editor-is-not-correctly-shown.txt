I want to use the PrimeVue Editor in my App. I have installed Quill and imported the Editor in my component.
according to my package.json I am using "quill": "^2.0.3" and 3.5.21
for Vue3
if I put this following code in my app I got a weird view of the editor. Can somebody explain what I am doing wrong? Did I forget something to install or do I have to add a css file here?
<Editor v-model="value" editorStyle="height: 320px">
<template v-slot:toolbar>
<span class="ql-formats">
<button v-tooltip.bottom="'Bold'" class="ql-bold"></button>
<button v-tooltip.bottom="'Italic'" class="ql-italic"></button>
<button v-tooltip.bottom="'Underline'" class="ql-underline"></button>
</span>
</template>
script part:
import Editor from "primevue/editor";
import { ref } from "vue";
const value = ref('<div>Hello World!</div><div>PrimeVue <b>Editor</b> Rocks</div><div><br></div>');
</script>
This is how it looks like: It seems that the styles for the editor are not set
