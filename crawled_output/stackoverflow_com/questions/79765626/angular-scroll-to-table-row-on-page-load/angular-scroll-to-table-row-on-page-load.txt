I have a mat-table in my app (angular v20) that is loading a longer list.
If an additional ID is provided, I would like to scroll to that ID in the table.
My problem is that I didn't find the right event to do this on page load.
I have a button that can call my scrollToRow(id) method - this works nicely.
I tried to call the scrollToRow in ngAfterViewInit() - didn't work.
changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.Default, not using signals.
matTable's datasource is refreshed in ngOnInit.
<table style="width: 100%;" mat-table matTableResponsive matSort
[dataSource]="dataSource" (matSortChange)="announceSortChange($event)" >
Do you have an idea how this issue can be fixed?
