I am trying to get the state of the content blocker I built, and SFContentBlockerManager.getStateOfContentBlocker(withIdentifier: extensionIdentifier) works perfectly fine for iOS 16 and lower, but ever since iOS 17 I keep getting this error
Error checking content blocker state: The operation couldn’t be completed. (SFErrorDomain error 1.)
Have you guys ever experienced this and how can i fix it?
