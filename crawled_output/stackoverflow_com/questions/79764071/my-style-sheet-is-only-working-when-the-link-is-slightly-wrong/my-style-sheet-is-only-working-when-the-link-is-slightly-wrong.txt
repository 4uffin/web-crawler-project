My style sheet is only updating when the link is slightly wrong such as the text below.
<link rel="stylesheet" href="csS/main.css">
or:
<link rel="stylesheet" href="Css/main.css">
When the link is correct such as: href="css/main.css,
my style sheet will unlink all together.
I am viewing the webpage through an XAMPP local host. Changing the index file and updating the page works as intended.
I've tried a bunch of random stuff online that I have found but it's hard to know what to actually look for when searching this problem.

1. Check the actual folder name in your project path, especially for uppercase and lowercase letters. If the folder is named Css, then you must write it exactly like that in your HTML. css, Css, and CSS are treated as different folders on systems that are case-sensitive. 2.
Sometimes the browser caches old CSS files and doesn’t show the latest changes especially when the file path changes. 3. If your index.html file is in the root directory and the css folder is at the same level, then the correct path should be : <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/main.css">
