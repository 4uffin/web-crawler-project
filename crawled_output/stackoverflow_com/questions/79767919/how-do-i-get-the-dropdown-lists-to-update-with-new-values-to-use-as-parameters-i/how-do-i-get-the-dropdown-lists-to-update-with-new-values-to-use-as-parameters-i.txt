How do I get the dropdown lists to update with new values to use as parameters in Power Query?

Here is what I have so far.
The main query for the survey dataset.
A query that returns a dataset of the distinct years in that dataset.
This will be used by the user to choose from to filter the survey data.
A query that returns a dataset of the distinct quarters.
This will also be used to filter the survey data.
Several other queries from Excel Table Ranges, such as Department.
This will be used to (somehow) change the Department number in the survey data to a name, for easier reading.
From some web reading and AI chats, I loaded the Year and Quarter queries into tables, then created a "dropdown" for each one, using the Data Validation -> List -> Source=Year Table/Quarter Table.
Then I was told to create another query based on the dropdown and use that in the Power Query editor as a parameter.
But, after adding some more test data into the DB, and refreshing all from the Data Ribbon, the new values do not show up in the dropdowns.
So, it's really a multi-part question here.
The survey data is on sheet "ResultSet01".
The miscellaneous queries, including the queries for Year and Quarter are loaded into "Supplemental Data" sheet.
And the sheet I am working with for user interface is "Sheet 1".
The Data Validation for the Quarter dropdown is: ='Supplemental Data'!$D$7.
I think this is restricting expansion of the dropdown list...
And the Year dropdown Data Validation is similar.
Ok, just got the dropdown to update as I had hoped by changing the formula to this: ='Supplemental Data'!$D5:$D8, all I did was remove the $ from the row numbers and it grew as I added more data.
Here is a screenshot of the connections I currently have:
So, I am stuck on:
how to get these dropdowns to update, (SOLVED, I think!)
how to filter the survey data with the chosen values from these dropdowns.
And the last question is: Am I doing this right?
