Test for text content of generated PDF in new tab with cucumber feature

I have a web application in Ruby on Rails which uses the wicked_pdf gem to render a PDF. A week ago the PDF rendering failed and my test suite running didn't show because a test was missing. The opened PDF above opens in a new tab so I want to test the PDF opening itself to be correctly rendering.
I actually am able to run cucumber tests for the click on the PDF link (which renders in a new tab) and double check that on the initial page shows a certain phrase. But if I want to check Then I should see "string_on_pdf" this fails. Probably the test suite is running the code not in the new tab with the PDF opened.
So my questions:
Is there a way in cucumber integration test to switch tabs to the PDF?
Can I then test for content with Then I should see on the PDF?

stackoverflow.com/questions/53099223/…, stackoverflow.com/questions/59585872/…, or stackoverflow.com/questions/41480782/pdf-reader-cucumber-ruby might help. Many people seem to recommend the pdf-inspector gem provided by prawn. If you are rendering directly to the browser, e.g. send_data you might want to refactor, so that you can directly test the "render to string" output.

Please note your question is incomplete since we have no means of determining how you are generating or distributing the PDF.
