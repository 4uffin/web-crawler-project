I want to set and instantiate the right type based on the value of another field and get typing and autocomplete on it.
I want this to happen automatically when the class is instantiated:
TMyBackendConfig = TypeVar("TMyBackendConfig")
class MyBackendOneConfig(BaseSettings):
field_one: str = "1111111"
class MyBackendTwoConfig(BaseSettings):
field_two: str = "222222222"
class Config(BaseSettings, Generic[TMyBackendConfig]):
# backend_type: Literal["one", "two"] # want to use this to set right one
backend_config: TMyBackendConfig
def test():
_one = MyBackendOneConfig()
_two = MyBackendTwoConfig()
one = Config(backend_config=_one)
two = Config(backend_config=_two)
# I get autocomplete and typing
one.backend_config.field_one
two.backend_config.field_two
I want to be able to just do Config(backend_type="one") and get back the object with the right nested config.

I'm not sure if this is possible, but a factory function taking "one" or "two" as argument and returning either a MyBackendOneConfig or a MyBackendTwoConfig seems simpler to me.

this ind of expressiveness in the typing system is possible with overloading - but it is designed for function-argument typing binding function return values.
(And you will need to create one overload entry for each such config) - I gues it woud be possible to create a hack using typing.Overload
to achieve what you are describing. But obviously, this is not what the static typing system is designed to convey.
