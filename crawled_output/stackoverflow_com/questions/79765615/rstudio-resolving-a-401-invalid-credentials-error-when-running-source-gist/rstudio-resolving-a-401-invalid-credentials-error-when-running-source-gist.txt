I am trying to install this function from Github. I ran this line
devtools::source_gist("00772ccea2dd0b0f1745", filename = "001_bag_functions.r")
Previously, this has worked for me. I have now started to have this error message thrown up with nothing that I can pinpoint that has changed.
Error in `gh::gh()`:
! GitHub API error (401): Requires authentication
ℹ Read more at <https://docs.github.com/rest>
Run `rlang::last_trace()` to see where the error occurred.
I have read through the documentation and updated my RStudio to see if this helps, but my experience on github is very limited and i find it tricky to navigate. Any help at all would be hugely appreciated!

I don't know why github seemingly requires authentication, but the error occurs in gh::gh("GET /gists/:id", id = id). I found the calls you were trying to make within this document on slide 45. You can visit the github gist here.
Using devtools::source_url() works:
library(ggplot2)
devtools::source_url("https://gist.githubusercontent.com/benmarwick/00772ccea2dd0b0f1745/raw/000_geom_bag.r")
devtools::source_url("https://gist.githubusercontent.com/benmarwick/00772ccea2dd0b0f1745/raw/001_bag_functions.r")

Wow, im impressed you found that document, i got the gist and functions elsewhere. Thank you so much though this works perfectly. What is different between source_url and source_gist that makes the former work?

@sofia source_url downloads an R file and sources it. R has a build in download function, which you can use to download files directly from URLs. source_gist() on the other hand performs a GET request to githubs REST API to fetch the R Script from a Repository. From what I can gather, this request is denied with error 401: unauthorized.
