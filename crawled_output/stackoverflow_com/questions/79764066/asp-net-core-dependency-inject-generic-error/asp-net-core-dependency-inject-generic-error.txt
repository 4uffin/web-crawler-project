I want to create a repository base class, every service should inherit from this BaseService.
This is my code:
public class BaseService<TEntity, TAddDto, TUpdateDto, TEntityDto> : IBaseService<TEntity, TAddDto, TUpdateDto, TEntityDto>
where TEntity : Entity<long>
where TAddDto : class
where TUpdateDto : class
where TEntityDto : class
{
private readonly IFreeSql<SqlServerFlag> _fsql;
public BaseService(IFreeSql<SqlServerFlag> fsql)
{
_fsql = fsql;
}
public virtual async Task<IResultOutput> AddAsync(TAddDto input)
{
var addEntity = input.Adapt<TEntity>();
await _fsql.Insert(addEntity).ExecuteAffrowsAsync();
return ResultOutput.Ok();
}
public virtual async Task<IResultOutput> UpdateAsync(TUpdateDto input)
{
var property = typeof(TUpdateDto).GetProperty("Id");
if (property == null)
{
throw new ArgumentException("Id is not exist");
}
var obj = property.GetValue(input);
await _fsql.Update<TEntity>(input)
.Where(LambdaHelper.GetPropertyNameExpression<TEntity>("Id", obj))
.ExecuteAffrowsAsync();
return ResultOutput.Ok();
}
public virtual async Task<IResultOutput> GetAsync(long id)
{
var dto = await _fsql.Select<TEntity>()
.Where(a => a.Id == id)
.FirstAsync<TEntityDto>();
return ResultOutput.Ok();
}
public virtual async Task<IResultOutput> FakeDeleteAsync(long id)
{
int rows = await _fsql.Update<TEntity>()
.Set(LambdaHelper.GetPropertyNameMemberExpression<TEntity>("IsDeleted", true), true)
.Where(a => a.Id == id)
.ExecuteAffrowsAsync();
return rows > 0 ? ResultOutput.Ok() : ResultOutput.NotOk();
}
public virtual async Task<IResultOutput> DeleteAsync(long id)
{
int rows = await _fsql.Delete<TEntity>()
.Where(a => a.Id == id)
.ExecuteAffrowsAsync();
return rows > 0 ? ResultOutput.Ok() : ResultOutput.NotOk();
}
}
}
This is the IBaseService interface:
public interface IBaseService<TEntity, TAddDto, TUpdateDto, TEntityDto>
where TEntity : Entity<long>
where TAddDto : class
where TUpdateDto : class
where TEntityDto : class
{
Task<IResultOutput> AddAsync(TAddDto input);
Task<IResultOutput> UpdateAsync(TUpdateDto input);
Task<IResultOutput> GetAsync(long id);
Task<IResultOutput> FakeDeleteAsync(long id);
Task<IResultOutput> DeleteAsync(long id);
}
I create an InternationalService that inherits from BaseService<,,,> like this:
public class InternationalService: BaseService<InternationalEntity, InternationalAddInput, InternationalUpdateInput, InternationalDto>, IInternationalService
{
public InternationalService(IFreeSql<SqlServerFlag> fsql):base(fsql)
{
}
}
The IInternationalService interface looks like this:
public interface IInternationalService: IBaseService<InternationalEntity, InternationalAddInput, InternationalUpdateInput, InternationalDto>
{
}
I inject the service in Program.cs:
// Inject Generic Service
builder.Services.AddScoped(typeof(IBaseService<,,,>), typeof(BaseService<,,,>));
// Inject the end name Service
var types = Assembly.Load("Xin.Service")
.GetExportedTypes()
.Where(a => a.Name.EndsWith("Service"));
foreach (var type in types)
{
var interfaces = type.GetInterfaces();
foreach (var baseType in interfaces)
{
builder.Services.AddScoped(baseType, type);
}
}
I want every service to inherit from BaseService, so I can ignore the basic add update delete...code, but I can't run the code.
Can you please help me? Thanks
when I run the app, the app don't work, the error was
Application terminated unexpectedly

Seems you try to register the interface IInternationalService as implementation type

Try modifying your filter for types to
something like .Where(a => a.Name.EndsWith("Service") && !a.IsInterface && !a.IsAbstract)
so it will try to register only the types that are instantiable.

If I read this correctly you want to implement boilerplate code in a base class, scan for all concrete implementations, and inject them into DI automatically.
If so, I think you're overcomplicating things.
Here's a simple demo to show one way of doing that.
First a generic interface:
public interface IMyService<T>
where T : class, new()
{
public T Data { get;}
Task<T> GetAsync(long id);
}
And a simple data object:
public record MyData
{
public string Name { get; init; } = "Not Set";
}
Next the base service definition:
public abstract class BaseService<T>
where T : class, new()
{
public Task<T> GetAsync(long id)
=> Task.FromResult<T>(new T() );
}
Note no IMyService inheritance: we don't want to capture it in any assembly scanning for the interface.
And finally a concrete implementation:
public class TestService : BaseService<MyData>, IMyService<MyData>
{
public MyData Data => new MyData() { Name = ($"{this.GetType().FullName}") };
public TestService() : base() { }
}
The following IServiceCollection extension class scans the main assembly, finds all the IMyService Services
and registers each against the interface.
public static class AddServicesExtensions
{
public static void AddMyServices(this IServiceCollection services)
{
var assembly = Assembly.GetCallingAssembly();
var requestHandlerInterfaceType = typeof(IMyService<>);
var handlerTypes = assembly
.GetTypes()
.Where(type => !type.IsAbstract && !type.IsInterface)
.SelectMany(type => type.GetInterfaces()
.Where(i => i.IsGenericType && i.GetGenericTypeDefinition() == requestHandlerInterfaceType)
.Select(i => new { Interface = i, Implementation = type }));
foreach (var handler in handlerTypes)
{
services.AddScoped(handler.Interface, handler.Implementation);
}
}
}
And Registration:
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
// Add services to the container.
builder.Services.AddRazorComponents()
.AddInteractiveServerComponents();
builder.Services.AddMyServices();
var app = builder.Build();
Here's a Blazor page that uses the service:
@page "/"
@inject IMyService<MyData> _service
<PageTitle>Home</PageTitle>
<h1>Hello, world! - @_service.Data.Name</h1>
Welcome to your new app.
