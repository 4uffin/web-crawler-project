I would like to add the job and build name as a pod label of the agent pod that is spawned by the kubernetes plugin.
I am aware this is possible by using inheritFrom in the agent definition and adding the label from pipeline definition, however, this has two issues:
It requires editing all jobs, which is unfeasible in my case (we have 20k+ pipelines, some as Jenkinsfiles, some saved directly in Jenkins)
It causes the agent pod name to be very long and dependent on job name, while I would like to keep it as its default format (<label>-<randomId>)
Is there another way, possibly at global level, that doesn't have these two drawbacks?
