I am new with docker just trying to create a docker compose file which have basicaly 3 containers: airflow, spark and minio.
Id like to orchestrate using airflow, scripts spark and persist it as delta tables on minio. I came up with this docker compose bellow. After running docker compose up and checking using docker compose ps i can see healthy containers but the airflow UI is not working, says
http://localhost:8080/ doesnt return data etc. Can someone give me any hint or review my code? thanks for any suggestion guys
