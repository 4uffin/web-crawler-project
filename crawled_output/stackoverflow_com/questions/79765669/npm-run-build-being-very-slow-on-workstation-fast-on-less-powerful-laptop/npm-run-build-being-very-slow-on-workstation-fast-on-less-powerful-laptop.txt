I am completely lost with what's going on with this issue. I have two computers, one powerful workstation and one less powerful laptop (specs below with cmd output). A couple of months ago, next dev, build, and so on started taking orders of magnitude longer on my desktop than it did before. I hadn't made any major hardware changes or installed additional packages so I didn't know where the slowdown was coming from. When I would go to load a recently modified page in dev, it would take minutes if it even ran. Then, I had the thought to try it on my laptop, which I have configured to program when I'm away from home. What took 15-20 min on my workstation took only 1 min on my laptop.
I tried a lot of things, including completely reformatting the drive and reinstalling Windows, but none made a difference. I completely disabled Windows Defender, and even ran it through WSL, though I haven't tried a raw Linux install on my desktop. The desktop isn't otherwise slow if I do benchmarks or anything like that, so that's not the issue. Note that, for this test, my laptop was running Ubuntu, but I get a similar result if my laptop is running Windows 11, which I have it set to dual boot. I'm unsure what a minimal reproducable error is for this, since I'm only able to produce the error on one machine.
EDIT: I tested through an ubuntu virtual machine running on the workstation, which was faster than running in windows directly while only having 2 cores and 6gb of ram.
Here's some output showing they're using the same node version and what the specs of each machine are:

Do you have any anti-virus / endpoint protection installed? Scanning filesystem writes can seriously slow down build processes

I disabled Windows Defender as one of the steps I took trying to resolve the issue. It didn't make a difference. I don't have any other antivirus installed.
