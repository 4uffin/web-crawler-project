Visual Studio can't recognize ServiceFabric.Mocks

I got this build error when I use ServiceFabric.Mocks.MockConfigurationPackage.
The type or namespace name 'Mocks' does not exist in the namespace 'Microsoft.ServiceFabric' (are you missing an assembly reference?)
I have Microsoft.ServiceFabric installed as a transitive package.
It seems visual studio can't differentiate these two packages.
This is how I use ServiceFabric.Mocks.
using Microsoft.Azure.Monitoring.Common.Logging;
using Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting;
using Moq;
using NSubstitute;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Collections.ObjectModel;
using System.Fabric;
using System.Fabric.Description;
using ServiceFabric.Mocks;
using static ServiceFabric.Mocks.MockConfigurationPackage;
using System.Fabric.Query;
using System.Threading;
using Xunit;
using Assert = VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting.Assert;
enter image description here
How can I resolve this? Thank you!
I tried reinstalling ServiceFabric.Mocks properly several times.
I tried clean and rebuild the solution/project.
Still seeing the same build error.
I expect this build error disapear.
