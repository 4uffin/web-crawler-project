I am trying to build a static FrankenPHP binary using their official Docker setup on Windows 10 with WSL 2 (Ubuntu). The build process, which uses docker buildx bake, fails at a step that downloads the static-php-cli (spc) binary.
docker buildx bake --load \
--set static-builder-musl.args.PHP_VERSION=8.2 \
--set static-builder-musl.args.FRANKENPHP_VERSION=v1.9.1 \
--set static-builder-musl.args.PHP_EXTENSIONS=pdo_sqlsrv,sqlsrv \
static-builder-musl
Executing docker build step
Error Log on Docker
curl -o spc -fsSL https://d1.static-php.dev/static-php-cli/spc-bin/nightly/spc-linux-x86_64
curl: (56) OpenSSL SSL_read: OpenSSL/3.5.2: error:0A000126:SSL routines::unexpected eof while reading, errno 0
Troubleshooting Steps I've Taken:
Direct curl in WSL: I ran the exact same curl command directly in my WSL terminal (outside of Docker), and it failed with the identical curl: (56) error.
I temporarily disabled my Windows Defender Firewall for both private and public networks, but the error persisted in WSL.
and then access via browser, i got this

I got this error again ‚Äî it's so frustrating trying to compile FrankenPHP as a static binary. You can see the error in the screenshot I posted in the FrankenPHP discussion

I think the issue might be that d1.static-php.dev doesn't resolve.
When I run that curl command on Fedora, I get the message "url: (6) Could not resolve host: d1.static-php.dev"
I suspect it's supposed to be a lowercase "L" instead of a numerical "1".
I'm pretty sure that replacing that curl with this will fix it:
curl -o spc -fsSL https://dl.static-php.dev/static-php-cli/spc-bin/nightly/spc-linux-x86_64

Thanks a lot for taking the time to answer my question! üôè
I checked inside build-static.sh from FrankenPHP, and I actually found the same snippet you mentioned:
# curl -o spc -fsSL "https://dl.static-php.dev/static-php-cli/spc-bin/nightly/spc-linux-${dl_arch}"
cp ../../local_deps/spc ./spc
chmod +x spc
spcCommand="./spc"
I also tried running the curl command from another laptop and on a different network, and it worked without any issues. So it looks like the URL itself is fine, probably just an environment or DNS problem on my side. Really appreciate your effort! 2025-09-14T19:48:09.457Z+00:00
