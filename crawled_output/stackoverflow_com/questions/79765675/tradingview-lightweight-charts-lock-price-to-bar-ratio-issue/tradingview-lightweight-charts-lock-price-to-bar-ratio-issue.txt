Tradingview Lightweight Charts - lock price to bar ratio issue

I am using lightweight charts 4 version. I want to implement "Lock price to bar ratio" option in my chart.
function handlePriceScaleLock() {
setPriceScaleLocked(v => {
const newState = !v;
const currentSpacing = chartRef.current?.timeScale().options().barSpacing;
chartRef.current?.applyOptions({
rightPriceScale: {
autoScale: !newState
}
});
return newState;
});
}
I added a button to the chart, and it triggers this function. By default, PriceScale and TimeScale start with false for locking. I want to use this function to set it to true if it's false and false if it's true. As you can see in the code, when I set the autoScale for rightPriceScale to false, priceScale locks and doesn't resize, but I couldn't do this for timeScale. TW has a function called "Lock price to bar ratio" on its own chart. What code should I write to make this function work on my chart as well?
Thanks.
