The New Growth Imperative
Cutting Through Complexity in the Financial System
Created in partnership with BCG
Exponential growth in complexity will continue.

Complexity & Complicatedness are on the Rise

"By leveraging modern technology and embracing a systems-based approach, we can unlock significant efficiencies and foster a more resilient and innovative ecosystem towards the dual goal of resilience and growth."
Adena Friedman, Chair & CEO, Nasdaq

Tal Cohen, President, Nasdaq
