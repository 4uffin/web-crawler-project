This Reinstatement Notification will indicate that the removed content will be reinstated in not less than ten (10) business days and no more than fourteen (14) business days, unless Nasdaq first receives notice from the copyright owner that a legal action has been initiated by the copyright owner in relation to the content.There are a number of items of information that a Notification of Claimed Infringement or a Counter-Notification must include in order to be effective; additionally, in order to be effective, the Notification of Claimed Infringement and Counter-Notification must be sent to a particular person designated for this purpose (Nasdaq Inc.'s "Designated Agent").
