Nasdaq-100 Pre-Market Indicator

The Nasdaq-100 Pre-Market Indicator is based on the same calculation used by the Nasdaq-100 Index during regular market hours - with key differences:
The Pre-Market Indicator is calculated based on last sale of Nasdaq-100 securities during pre-market trading, 8:15 to 9:30 a.m. ET. And if a Nasdaq-100 security does not trade in the pre-market, the calculation uses last sale from the previous day's 4 p.m. closing price.
The pre-market indicator uses unique editing logic that filters any bad trades from the calculation. The result? A more accurate reading of market trends.
Tracking over several months has shown that the Nasdaq-100 Pre-Market Indicator and After Hours Indicator are on target as gauges of market sentiment leading up to the 9:30 a.m. open and in after hours trading. The Nasdaq-100 Indicator is a meaningful tool for investors and the financial news media who want to get a sense of the market during extended trading hours.

The five day volume chart provides share volume for the past five days in the Pre-Market Market. Investors can compare the current day's volume to the totals in the table for the last five days.

Investors may trade in the Pre-Market (4:00-9:30 a.m. ET) and the After Hours Market (4:00-8:00 p.m. ET). Participation from Market Makers and ECNs is strictly voluntary and as a result, these sessions may offer less liquidity and inferior prices. Stock prices may also move more quickly in this environment. Investors who anticipate trading during these times are strongly advised to use limit orders.
Data is delayed at least 15 minutes. Nasdaq.com will report pre-market and after hours trades.
Pre-Market trade data will be posted from 4:15 a.m. ET to 7:30 a.m. ET of the following day.
After Hours trades will be posted from 4:15 p.m. ET to 3:30 p.m. ET of the following day.
