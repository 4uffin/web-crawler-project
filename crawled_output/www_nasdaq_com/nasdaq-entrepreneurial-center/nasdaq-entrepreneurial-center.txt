Profiles
Faces of Entrepreneurship
The Faces of Entrepreneurship series profiles a wide variety of entrepreneurs who approach entrepreneurship with a unique perspective. We ask that they tell their story(ies) of triumph and struggle to encourage the next generation of entrepreneurs. We seek out inspiring leaders to contribute, with a special focus on those whose voices are underrepresented or those from traditionally under-estimated populations.
