FAQ
It doesn’t matter if you’re running a hospital, asset management firm, or nonprofit, Nasdaq Governance Solutions can help your board work better, starting now.
I don’t work in finance. Can I still use Nasdaq’s governance products?
Absolutely. Our suite of governance solutions helps public, private, and nonprofit organizations across all industries improve board capability and streamline their corporate governance efforts.
I have a limited budget. Do I have to purchase the entire solutions suite?
Not at all. Each product functions independently, aligned with a particular governance aspect. Organizations have the flexibility of choosing which solutions work best for their needs, without committing to the entire suite. However, many of our clients choose to leverage our entire suite of solutions for the benefit of relying on a single, trusted partner.
My company is not publicly listed. Is Nasdaq Governance Solutions for me?
Definitely. We serve a wide variety of board and governance needs for companies that are not publicly listed and drive value to public, private, and nonprofit organizations of all sizes and across all industries. Nasdaq Governance Solutions is a fit for any organization that wants to advance governance excellence.
Which governance solution should I start with?
Each product in the suite is targeted to a different area of governance. Whether you’re looking to streamline board meeting management with Nasdaq Boardvantage, digitize directors’ and officers’ (D&O) questionnaires with Nasdaq EnGauge, identify opportunities for board improvement with evaluations, or all the above, you’re able to start with the solutions that matter most for your corporate governance objectives. Our sales staff will be happy to help you identify the most beneficial governance function to build out with one of our solutions.
What security measures are in place for its products and services?
We know security is of paramount importance. Customer data is protected by the same team of information security professionals who monitors Nasdaq’s global markets. The security of our platforms is of the utmost importance and customers can work confidently knowing Nasdaq’s Information Security Management System (ISMS) is ISO 27001 certified. Our board management software, Nasdaq Boardvantage, has robust, specific controls for security, encryption, and customer-configurable security permissions. With industry-standard security controls, documents and materials, which are uploaded to the Nasdaq Boardvantage, service (“Customer Uploaded Content”) is encrypted in transit with TLS protocol and at rest with AES-256. Nasdaq EnGauge™ technology enables boards to streamline data collection with end-to-end security processes in mind, and all customers have access to 24/7 customer support to answer questions.
