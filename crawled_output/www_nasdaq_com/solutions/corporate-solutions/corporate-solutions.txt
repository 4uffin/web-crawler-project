Testimonials
See What Others Have to Say
Nasdaq's governance solution is incredibly user friendly and simple to use, making it ideal for our executive assistant, board members, and directors.
Chief Financial Officer, JF Maddox Foundation
Our long-standing partnership with Nasdaq stems from our great relationship and the way that Equity Surveillance and Investor Engagement work together; it's a full package for us, and we don't see those services coming together as seamlessly with other providers.
Kelsey Freed, Director, Investor Relations, Wendy's
We've been using Nasdaq for a few years now, and we're delighted with it. It has naturally established itself as a company-wide reporting tool. For example, we have a CSR community of 120 employees in 27 countries. Our relationship with the Nasdaq team is great: follow-ups and support always go smoothly!
Charline Griaud, Extra-Financial Reporting Manager, Up Group
Nasdaq’s platform was our primary focus when we evaluated board collaboration solutions. Implementing the product was a great move for us in managing communications with our board.
