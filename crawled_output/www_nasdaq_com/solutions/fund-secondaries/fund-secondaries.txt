Our Platform
Creating a Path to Liquidity in the Secondary Market
We support the rapidly changing secondaries landscape with purpose-built technology for private fund sponsors and investors seeking liquidity.
Streamline Operations with a Globally Recognized Trading Technology Provider
Improve transaction certainty for buyers and sellers with better process standards and transparency- from price discovery and allocation through contract execution & settlement.
Expand Team Capacity
Executing deals is a labor-intensive process without a scalable technology solution. Our platform helps deal teams overcome workflow inefficiencies with built-in transparency and security controls, freeing them up to allocate resources toward their core functions.
Work with a Regulated Business Partner
Nasdaq Fund Secondaries facilitates auctions for positions in private funds as a Qualified Matching Service (“QMS”) in accordance with Treasury Reg 1.7704-1(g) and an IRS private letter ruling.
Transfers of interests through a QMS can enable a fund to increase the potential total amount of transferable interest per annum from 2% up to 10%, subject to certain limitations.
Mitigate Counter-Party Risk
Our institutional network is comprised of established secondary buyers.
