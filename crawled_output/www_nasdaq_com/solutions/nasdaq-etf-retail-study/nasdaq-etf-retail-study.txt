Nasdaq conducted a survey of over 2,000 retail investors — from Gen Z to Baby Boomers — to discover the latest trends in the investment decision-making process. From economic attitudes to risk preferences and asset classes to advice, the results create an interesting landscape for market participants.
As the ETF wrapper evolves and new cohorts of investors enter the marketplace, it’s vital that ETF providers and financial advisors adapt their unique product development, distribution, and promotional strategies to stay ahead.

ETF Thematics
Cryptocurrency, financial technology, and artificial intelligence remain the top ETF themes across all demographics, with half of Millennials (50%) and nearly half of Gen Zers (46%) holding cryptocurrency-themed ETFs. ETF holders cited high growth potential, long-term investment opportunity and technological innovation as their main reasons for investing in crypto, fintech and AI ETFs.
