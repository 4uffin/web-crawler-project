HOW TO LIST A COMPANY ON NASDAQ
U.S. Electronic Application Filing Process
Step 1: Gather Company Information
Gather basic company information, like the Central Index Key (CIK) code, current or reserved trading symbol and CUSIP that you'll need to complete forms.
If you don't know what information you need, access forms in preview mode to see. We can pre-populate much of the company's general information for you. Note: a reserved trading symbol is not required for non-convertible bonds, other than baby bonds. If you have not already reserved your trading symbol or you would like to change your symbol upon listing, please complete a Symbol Reservation Form before you begin.
Step 2: Create An Account
Create a User Account to complete forms on the Listing Center.
Email address and basic contact information required so we can email you a link used to verify your credentials. Then, choose a password, answer some security questions and you’re all set.
Step 3: Complete Your Application
Companies listing on the Nasdaq Stock Market can complete the entire application process electronically. You can also submit supplemental documentation electronically.
You can complete your form all at once or save your work and continue another time. You can even share your form with other users.
Step 4: Connect With Your Listing Analyst
Within a few hours of your submission, you will receive a system-generated acknowledgement email. In a couple of business days, you will receive another email providing you with the contact information for the Analyst assigned to your application.
Step 5: Reserve A Symbol
Confirm availability and complete your Nasdaq Symbol Reservation using the online form.

NASDAQ LISTINGS FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
Ways To List On Nasdaq
What is an initial public offering?
An initial public offering, or IPO, is a company's first sale of stock to the public. Securities offered in an IPO are often, but not always, those of young, small companies seeking outside equity capital and a public market for their stock. In 2021, we extended our IPO leadership with a 76% win rate for operating company IPOs.
What is a virtual IPO?
At Nasdaq our “Modern Day IPO” process leverages data and technology to open IPOs electronically and remotely. Even when physical trading floors were closed during the pandemic, Nasdaq uses its same technology to launch IPO first trades in coordination with the lead underwriter to provide best-in-class IPO execution.
What is a direct listing?
The term direct listing refers to a private company listing on Nasdaq, or another exchange, without concurrently raising capital. Generally, companies list on a national securities exchange in connection with a capital raising transaction, such as an initial public offering. By contrast, a direct listing allows a company to list securities and begin trading without selling additional securities to public investors.
What is a SPAC?
Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPACs) are publicly-traded investment vehicles that raise funds via an IPO in order to complete a future acquisition. They enable private companies to have a unique way to access the public markets, while offering investors a way to co-invest side-by-side with best-in-class sponsors. In 2021, Nasdaq welcomed 69% of U.S. business combinations, including SoFi Technologies, Arrival SA, and PureCycle Technologies.
What is an ADR?
American Depository Receipts (ADRs) are securities that trade in the U.S. but represent a specified number of a non-U.S. company’s shares. ADRs trade and settle like other securities and are priced in U.S. dollars, regardless of the currency of the underlying shares. Only “sponsored” ADRs are eligible to list on Nasdaq, and the issuer of an ADR must register with the SEC and comply with U.S. securities laws, including the periodic reporting requirements.
What is a transfer of listing?
A transfer of listing refers to a company that is already listed on another U.S. exchange or trades on a non-U.S. exchange and is transferring its securities to Nasdaq. In recent years, $2.2 trillion in market cap has transferred to Nasdaq.
Where You Can List
The Nasdaq Stock Exchange
The Nasdaq Stock Market has three distinctive tiers: The Nasdaq Global Select Market®, The Nasdaq Global Market® and The Nasdaq Capital Market®.
Applicants must satisfy certain financial, liquidity and corporate governance requirements to be approved for listing on any of these market tiers. The initial financial and liquidity requirements for the Nasdaq Global Select Market are more stringent than those for the Nasdaq Global Market and likewise, the initial listing requirements for the Nasdaq Global Market are more stringent than those for the Nasdaq Capital Market.
Corporate governance requirements are the same across all Nasdaq market tiers. It is important to note that even though a company’s securities meet all enumerated criteria for initial inclusion, Nasdaq may deny initial listing, or apply additional conditions, if necessary to protect investors and the public interest.
Nasdaq First North Growth Market
Nasdaq First North is our European growth market for small- and medium sized companies. A company can join Nasdaq First North regardless of the country of origin or industry sector. A key factor for success is that there is investor interest for the company’s share. The Nordic region boasts the largest retail presence in the world per capita, with small private investors and professional investors taking an active role in the market.
Nasdaq First North Premier Growth Market
Nasdaq First North Premier is our European growth market designed to further assist companies in raising investor visibility and to prepare them for a Main Market listing. The segment targets companies that make a conscious decision to comply with higher disclosure and accounting standards than those imposed on Nasdaq First North.
Nordic Main Market
The Main Market is our Nordic regulated market suited to companies that can adhere to the highest standards. Today, 625 companies are traded across our Main Markets in Stockholm, Copenhagen, Helsinki and Iceland, including some of the most innovative companies in the Nordic region. By listing on the Main Market, companies benefit from increased visibility and investor exposure, and Nasdaq’s efficient and independent surveillance of issuers, members and trading. 164 trading member firms engage in the daily trading, with most trades made by international banks and brokerage houses.
Baltic Market
Nasdaq Baltic exchanges provide regulated market and First North listing services for a variety of financial instruments as well as services related to the public trading of financial instruments. When seeking a listing, an issuer may choose from among the regulated market and First North organized by the Baltic exchanges, depending on the type of the financial instrument.
