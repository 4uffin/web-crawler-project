Yes. Throughout our almost 30-year history, we have continued to innovate and adapt our technology to effectively monitor new markets and asset classes. Our coverage now spans over 200 markets and 300+ behaviors – spanning multiple asset classes and markets, including crypto.
How is Nasdaq Trade Surveillance different from other tools?
Nasdaq Trade Surveillance is one of the most robust surveillance tools on the market.
