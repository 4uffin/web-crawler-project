Improve this question
I'm currently developing an AI-based Farmer Query Support and Advisory System and would appreciate some guidance on the best machine learning models to use.
My goal is to create a system that can address a range of farmer queries, including:
Crop Disease and Pest Detection: Identifying diseases and pests from images or descriptions provided by the farmer.
Crop Recommendation: Suggesting suitable crops based on a farmer's location, soil type, and weather conditions.
Weather and Yield Prediction: Providing localized weather forecasts and estimating potential crop yield.
Soil Health and Nutrient Recommendation: Analyzing soil data to suggest appropriate fertilizers and nutrients.
Could you please provide some recommendations and insights into the specific machine learning models that would be most effective for each of these tasks? Any advice on the types of datasets, challenges, and best practices for implementation would also be highly valuable.
I have make a prototype using the figma nothing else
