Your mind doesn’t, though. It’s still ruminating. Was that snark in my boss’s voice? Were they talking about me before I logged on?I wonder if some of this could also be related to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostile_attribution_bias where some people simply see ambiguous or benign behavior they don't like and interpret it as hostile.replymakeitdouble 39 minutes ago

I read it as just being context dependent. The "Tripoli" vs "Triple E" bit in the article was to me another anecdote on how we resolve ambiguity based on what we have in our mind's stack at the moment:> A friend once told me of an ingenious class demonstration that helped her begin to understand this process. A professor split the class in two and then spoke to the first half alone, telling them of his love for travel and a recent trip to Libya. Next, he spoke to the second half about shopping and how hard it was to find the right size shoe. Last, he brought the class together and said a single word. He asked the students to write it down. Students in the first group wrote, “Tripoli.” Those in the second wrote, “Triple E.”replyteddyh 2 hours ago

Original title: “Why We Spiral”; mangled by HN to the incomprehensible “We Spiral”.replyisoprophlex 12 minutes ago

That makes one wonder what happens if one was to submit a story titled "Why"replyairstrike 1 hour ago

FYI HN does edit out the "Why", but OP can go in and modify the title after submitting.replydaveguy 48 minutes ago

Maybe HN needs an "if num_words > 3" before the "delete leading Why". Or maybe an "if char_count > CHAR_LIMIT" before the "delete leading Why".Or just don't. What a near guaranteed way to mangle the meaning of a title.replyadmissionsguy 1 hour ago

I found the shortened one accurate and also thought provokingreplychrisweekly 1 hour ago

I think the shortened title is actually better; the essay doesn't go deep into "why", it's more a set of observations illustrating that we do in fact spiral.replyMarkLowenstein 22 minutes ago

I figured it was going to be about WeWork circling the drain. Thankfully it wasn't.replyt43562 1 hour ago

I think it's useful to try to always assume the best from others:
- If they aren't being friendly this will irritate them in a way they cannot object to too openly.
- If they are friendly it will avoid damage and even start an upward spiral.
When you're not feeling good enough it's sometimes helpful to remember that even people who create negative impacts often get into positions of power and stay there for one reason or another. i.e if they can do something very badly then why are you so worried about whether you are worthy?Finally, remember that lots of people feel like you - so try to do little things that start them on an upward spiral.
The more you do this for other people, the more they will be glad to see you.replycxr 1 hour ago

That's the rational response on their end, but not only is no one perfectly rational, but some people are very, very irrational.It can sometimes[1][2] be the case that the best option is to be among those who don't attract any attention at all.Separately:The spiraling described in this post is worth consideration, but equally worthy are the odd disparities in professional life (or life in general) that aren't the result of internal forces like paralyzing self-doubt.Consider an article that starts just like this one, except it focuses on the different consequences experienced by Dawn who is regularly forgiven for things like tardiness and mistakes in her work in contrast to more severe outcomes for Hila, who after arriving late—perhaps for the first time, even—is perceived to be fucking up because that's in her irresponsible nature[3]—even if a sober, objective analysis would reveal that Hila is actually exceeding the expectations one would have for any employee (and her transgressions are well behind the line of courtesy that is extended to Dawn)—for no other reason than Hila being younger or newer to the company.This can result in a similar spiral of defeat, but it's a kind of defeat by external forces rather than self-defeat.1. Depending on your environment/experience, you could even say "very often"2. See also <https://hn.algolia.com/?query=copenhagen%20strikes%20again&t...>3.

Indeed, the default should be to assume the best intentions of people. Also, people can have a bad day and be snarky. Next meeting they might as well be friendly.Staying positive and not letting (potential) negative feedback derail you, works like magic in the long run.If someone is really picking on you, or they genuinely disapprove of your work, you will find out in due time.replymakeitdouble 33 minutes ago

For people trying to sit more in the middle, forcing a neutral balance is another way to do it: don't burn bridges and don't over assume people's feelings.That means not one-upping snark, but also keeping a healthy default distance with people you deal with professionaly.One might miss some genuinely heartful exchanges, but it also makes the worst times way easier to deal with. Compensating for keeping too much distance is usually easy, repairing problematic exchanges is way way harder.replyAstralStorm 17 minutes ago

Except this is self sabotaging, because you have no deep connection you stay alone and feel alone, ultimately spiralling.reply47282847 51 minutes ago

I generally agree but in my experience it becomes more complex when you cognitively decide on one thing (to assume the best), but don’t feel it. How you feel influences how it’s going to happen in major and in subtle ways. Your return friendliness may be received as snarky or sarcasm, or at least detected as insincere, to give one example.replyikjasdlk2234 1 hour ago

I've found that handwritten letters, to my friends and to my colleagues, tends to go a very long way in making someone's day. Something that takes me ten minutes tends to make a difference for a month of more.reply
