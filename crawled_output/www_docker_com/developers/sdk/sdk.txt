Build with the Docker Extensions SDK
Create and share your own extensions
In a world where there’s a tool for everything, integration and user experience are crucial to a frictionless developer workflow. For this reason, we created Docker Extensions to help developers reduce context switching and increase productivity.
Using Extensions, developers can integrate seamlessly with external tools — and even create brand-new ones!
Our Docker Extensions SDK Quickstart guide gives you a jumpstart to building your own extensions for smooth, fast, and native integration directly into Docker Desktop.

Build and launch your first Docker Extension
To get started, you’ll need the latest version of Docker Desktop. Then, use the Extensions CLI to create your extension.
Tip: extension is a command in the Docker CLI. Run docker help to see extension listed. Run docker extension help to see all of the extension options.
Build
Step 1: Create the extension from a boilerplate
First, with this init command, generate a hello-world extension with a basic UI and a connected backend service (optional).
docker extension init my-extension
Step 2: Build and install the extension
Then, build an image and install your extension from that image using this command.
make install-extension
Step 3: Open the Docker Desktop Dashboard
Test the extension by navigating to the extension tab in the left-menu drawer. You should now have a running extension!
Share
If you want to share this extension with your team or community (but aren’t ready for countless developer eyes), we’ve got you covered! Learn how to install non-Marketplace extensions.
Submit to Marketplace
You can also distribute your extension to millions of developers with one click installation.
All submissions are reviewed before being added to the Marketplace. To pass the review, make sure you’ve followed our Extension submission guidelines, and then submit your extension to our Marketplace.
