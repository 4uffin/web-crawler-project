Thank you for your interest. The Docker Team will be in touch.
Accelerate agentic AI development with Docker MCP Catalog and Toolkit
Whether you’re building AI-powered apps or agents, the MCP Catalog gives you a curated set of trusted servers to get started fast. Connect MCP servers to clients like Docker AI Agent, Claude, Cursor, VS Code, Windsurf, continue.dev, and Goose — quickly and securely. The MCP Toolkit handles setup, authentication, and security behind the scenes so you can stay focused on what matters. Built on Docker Hub, it’s a reliable home for uploading, storing, and managing MCP servers with enterprise-grade security and control.
MCP, Docker-Ready
Discover hundreds of MCP servers
Browse popular MCP servers such as Stripe, Elastic, New Relic, Neo4j, and many more on Docker Hub – fully containerized and ready to use safely in sandboxed runtimes.
Your favorite MCP clients. One-click away
Connect to any MCP clients. For popular tools like Docker AI Agent, Claude, VS Code, and Cursor, setup is even simpler with one-click integration.
Fast, secure authentication
Authenticate MCP servers once, then use them across all clients. Credentials stay safe with Docker.
Build secure, scalable MCP tools
Publish, pull, and manage MCP servers on Docker Hub with enterprise-grade controls built in.
Quotes from Docker MCP partners
“MCP is a significant innovation for agent builders. By bringing the Elasticsearch MCP server to the Docker MCP Catalog, we’re enabling more teams to leverage Elasticsearch for AI agents with secure, scalable vector database and hybrid search capabilities.”
Shay Banon
Founder and Chief Technology Officer, Elastic
“By partnering with Docker, we’re making it easy to discover and run 20+ tools within the Grafana MCP server in secure, containerized environments, This gives MCP clients and AI agents instant, programmatic access to observability data and workflows across dashboards, alerts, incidents, and on-call schedules. With Grafana MCP servers, developers can build smarter, more connected agents. The possibilities are wide open.”
Chris Marchbanks
Principal Software Engineer, Grafana Labs.
“New Relic is committed to its open partner ecosystem and working with partners like Docker to bring much-needed simplicity and trust to AI-native development. New Relic continues to lead the industry in AI and observability by joining Docker’s MCP Catalog and Toolkit and bringing intelligent observability to developers building the next generation of applications.”
Camden Swita
Head of AI and ML Innovation, New Relic
“We launched the Webflow MCP Server to let agents and developers interact with our API the same way they work with code — inline and in context. Docker takes that experience even further by removing friction around credential management for Docker users. We’re proud to be a launch partner for the Docker MCP Catalog and Toolkit and excited to support the next wave of innovation in building and delivering online experiences.”
Utkarsh Sengar
Vice President, Engineering, Webflow
“With Docker MCP Toolkit, you can spin up Stripe MCP in an isolated container—making it fast and easy for developers to integrate Stripe into your AI workflows.”
Jeff Weinstein
Product Lead, Stripe
“At Continue, we understand the frustration of spending more time tinkering with AI systems than actually coding. Docker’s MCP Catalog works seamlessly with our curated server blocks on hub.continue.dev by handling the technical complexity—from authentication to configuration—so you can focus on what matters: building assistants that fit your workflow perfectly. This gives developers the power to create AI-native tools that amplify capabilities without sacrificing control.”
Nate Sesti
Co-Founder and Chief Technology Officer, continue.dev
