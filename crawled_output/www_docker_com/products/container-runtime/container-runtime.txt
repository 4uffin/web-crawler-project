The Industry-Leading Container Runtime
Docker Engine powers millions of applications worldwide, providing a standardized packaging format for diverse applications.
Docker Engine Sparked the Containerization Movement
Docker Engine is the industry’s de facto container runtime that runs on various Linux (CentOS, Debian, Fedora, RHEL, and Ubuntu) and Windows Server operating systems. Docker creates simple tooling and a universal packaging approach that bundles up all application dependencies inside a container which is then run on Docker Engine. Docker Engine enables containerized applications to run anywhere consistently on any infrastructure, solving “dependency hell” for developers and operations teams, and eliminating the “it works on my laptop!” problem.
Why Docker Engine?
Accelerate Innovation
Docker Engine forms the common foundation underlying many cloud-native applications, letting developers turn ideas into reality quickly and securely.
Freedom of Choice
Docker Engine supports any type of application – legacy to cloud-native, monolithic to 12-factor – and works with multiple operating systems, across hybrid/multi-cloud and validated to work with Kubernetes CRI.
Intrinsic Security
Docker Engine is built with security in mind. With Docker Content Trust and FIPS 140-2 validation, Docker Engine users can run containerized applications in highly regulated environments.

Integrated BuildKit
BuildKit is an open source tool that takes the instructions from a Dockerfile and ‘builds” a Docker image. This process can take a long time so BuildKit provides several architectural enhancements that makes it much faster, more precise and portable.

Docker CLI
The most popular way to interface with Docker containers is the Docker CLI – a simple, yet powerful client that greatly simplifies how you manage container instances through a clear set of commands.
