Tired of CVEs? Start with a Docker Hardened Image
Docker Hardened Images are ultra-minimal, production-ready container images built from source for maximum security. Maintained by Docker and backed by an enterprise SLA, they offer faster patching, near-zero CVEs, and up to 95% less attack surface. With built-in SBOMs, SLSA compliance, and digital signatures, every image is fully verifiable and trusted. Updates are continuous and automated—no manual effort needed.

Secure, Compatible, and Customizable
Docker Hardened Images adapt into your workflow –  no retooling, no surprises. Built on familiar distros like Alpine and Debian and following a distroless approach, they strip away unneeded components to reduce risk. Unlike other minimal images, DHIs balance security with flexibility, letting you customize with certs, packages, and configs – all on a hardened, verifiable foundation.
Run open source with confidence
Get ultra-minimal, regularly updated base and application images maintained by Docker-built with a distroless approach to deliver near-zero CVEs and a dramatically reduced attack surface from day one.
Enterprise-Ready from the Start
Go from base image to production with ease. Add custom certificates, packages, and configs-while built-in signing, provenance, and SBOMs help you meet compliance requirements. With CVE and VEX feeds included, you can move fast without compromising security.
Boost Developer Velocity
Cut the time spent patching, verifying, and maintaining images. Customize with no CI rebuilds. Reduce scanner noise and free up devs to focus on shipping, not chasing CVEs or managing image forks.
Seamless Migration
Move to Docker Hardened Images without disrupting your workflow. With support for familiar distros like Alpine and Debian, upgrading is as easy as changing one line in your Dockerfile – no need to rewrite apps, abandon tooling, or retrain your team.
Features and Capabilities
Container Security, Made Simple
Fast, SLA-Backed Remediation
Patch Critical and High severity CVEs within 7 days- faster than typical industry response times and backed by an enterprise-grade SLA.
Multi-distro support
Use trusted Linux distros like Alpine and Debian to meet internal standards and app needs – while customizing images with the packages and settings your team requires.
Industry-Leading, Source-Built Hardening
Docker Hardened Images use an industry-leading, distroless hardening approach – removing risky components and building from source to enable faster patches, fewer vulnerabilities, and SLA-backed security.
Debug Images Without the Headaches
Use docker debug to inspect, edit, and troubleshoot containers right from the CLI – no image changes, no workflow disruptions, just a built-in toolbox when you need it.
Self-Service Customization
Add certifications, packages, environment variables, and user configurations via secure OCI layering – no forks, no custom pipelines, and no patching overhead.
FedRAMP Acceleration
Meet federal security standards with FIPS-enabled, STIG-ready images and signed SBOMS, continuously maintained and hardened by Docker to support compliance.
Built to Fit Your DevSecOps Stack
“Secure base images are foundational to modern software delivery,” said Lee Skillen, co-founder and CTO at Cloudsmith. “Docker’s Hardened Images set a strong standard in the container ecosystem: ultra-minimal, near-zero-CVE, and easily accessible. We’re proud to partner with Docker to make these trusted images available directly through Cloudsmith, giving developers full traceability and continuous security from source to production. We’re excited to be part of it.“
Lee Skillen
Co-founder and CTO at Cloudsmith
“By making our solutions available as Docker Hardened Images, we’re addressing the growing demand for secure supply chains while maintaining the performance and flexibility our users expect. We’re proud to be part of Docker’s effort to raise the security standard for container images across the industry.”
Shawn Wormke
VP and General Manager of NGINX at F5
“Securing containers at scale is a growing challenge for developers working with modern software…By combining Docker’s vast developer reach with Sonatype’s expertise in managing open-source dependencies, this collaboration empowers developers to build secure software faster and with more innovation. It streamlines secure-by-default software supply chains, helping teams focus on what matters most—delivering high-quality code quickly and confidently.”
Mitchell Johnson
Chief Product Development Officer at Sonatype
