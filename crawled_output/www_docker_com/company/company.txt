Our Company
We simplify the lives of developers building world-changing apps.
Join our Team
About Docker
Docker helps developers bring their ideas to life by conquering the complexity of app development. Actively used by millions of developers around the world, Docker Desktop and Docker Hub provide unmatched simplicity, agility and choice.
Docker Virtues
Our virtues guide how we operate and make decisions.
Developer Obsession
We constantly put ourselves in the shoes of the developer. We seek their feedback and, by understanding their needs, we build solutions that they love. Every decision we make, big or small, starts with the customer developer in mind.
Humble Confidence
We leave our egos at the door. We extend kindness to each other. We assume positive intent. We respect and value differences. We are open to feedback and actively seek to learn from our mistakes.
Bias for Considered Action
We make data driven decisions and once a decision is made, we move! We may disagree, but as a team we commit and get behind the plan. We are not afraid to fail fast; we learn from our mistakes. We are empowered to tackle challenges in exciting and innovative ways.
Open Collaboration
Together, we can do great things. Our success is driven by our ability to break down silos and connect across teams, functions and geographies. We welcome new ideas and opinions from each other, our customers and the entire community. We value transparency. We ask questions. We challenge one another respectfully. We seek input and offer feedback.
Outcome Driven
To realize our desired outcomes, we maintain focus on the goals we set. We take ownership of our work while also leaning on the expertise of others. When tough choices need to be made, we think critically about their implications and commit to decisions that get us closer to the intended results. And if tasks drift from our North Star, we pivot and communicate to realign our day to day priorities.
