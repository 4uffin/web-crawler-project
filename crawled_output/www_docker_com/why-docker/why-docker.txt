Developing with Docker
Developing apps today requires so much more than writing code. Multiple languages, frameworks, architectures, and discontinuous interfaces between tools for each lifecycle stage creates enormous complexity. Docker simplifies and accelerates your workflow, while giving developers the freedom to innovate with their choice of tools, application stacks, and deployment environments for each project.
Containers were just the Beginning
In 2013, Docker introduced what would become the industry standard for containers. Containers are a standardized unit of software that allows developers to isolate their app from its environment, solving the “it works on my machine” headache. For millions of developers today, Docker is the de facto standard to build and share containerized apps – from desktop, to the cloud. We are building on our unique connected experience from code to cloud for developers and developer teams.
Learn the Basics of Docker
Build Containerized Apps
Conquer App Complexity with Docker
Keep it Simple
Docker’s friendly, CLI-based workflow makes building, sharing, and running containerized applications accessible to developers of all skill levels.
Move Fast
Install from a single package to get up and running in minutes. Code and test locally while ensuring consistency between development and production.
Collaborate
Use Certified and community-provided images in your project. Push to a cloud-based application registry and collaborate with team members.
Built for Developers, by Developers
At Docker, we work to make the developers’ lives easier because we’re developers too. From building Docker tools that improve dev workflows, to creating industry standards for containerizing apps. From contributing to open source projects and to being elected to the CNCF Technical Oversight Committee, the people building Docker tech are one of the things that sets us apart from the rest.
