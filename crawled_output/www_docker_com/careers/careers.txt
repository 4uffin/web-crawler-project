Docker’s Virtues
As a company, we’re always guided by our Docker virtues. Lots of companies decide on values or virtues and just stick them on posters on the walls. We don’t do that; instead, we talk about them regularly. How we go about our work, and how we interact with each other and our customers, is always driven by those virtues.
Developer Obsession
We constantly put ourselves in the shoes of the developer. We seek their feedback and, by understanding their needs, we build solutions that they love. Every decision we make, big or small, starts with the customer developer in mind.
Humble Confidence
We leave our egos at the door. We extend kindness to each other. We assume positive intent. We respect and value differences. We are open to feedback and actively seek to learn from our mistakes.
Bias for Considered Action
We make data driven decisions and once a decision is made, we move! We may disagree, but as a team we commit and get behind the plan. We are not afraid to fail fast; we learn from our mistakes. We are empowered to tackle challenges in exciting and innovative ways.
Open Collaboration
Together, we can do great things. Our success is driven by our ability to break down silos and connect across teams, functions and geographies. We welcome new ideas and opinions from each other, our customers and the entire community. We value transparency. We ask questions. We challenge one another respectfully. We seek input and offer feedback.
Outcome Driven
To realize our desired outcomes, we maintain focus on the goals we set. We take ownership of our work while also leaning on the expertise of others. When tough choices need to be made, we think critically about their implications and commit to decisions that get us closer to the intended results. And if tasks drift from our North Star, we pivot and communicate to realign our day to day priorities.
“My time at Docker has taught me what true cooperation and trust looks like. I can reach out to anyone in any branch and they’ll gladly assist me with any of my needs. The managers here are well equipped to help you grow in your position and heavily encourage upward mobility!”
Harrison Webster
Renewals Manager II
Docker Culture
Autonomy, Freedom and Flexibility
We trust you to get your work done however it fits into your lifestyle. Our flexible schedule lets you set priorities and maximize productivity.
Work / Life Balance
We want you to maintain balance to thrive, reduce stress, and prevent burnout.
Transparency
We believe that companies should be transparent. We’re open and honest with our employees.
Collaboration
We work together as a team in all departments and levels. We openly share ideas.
Appreciation
We know the employees are the heart and soul of Docker. We let them know how important they are every chance we get.
Respect
We treat you how we want to be treated. We listen to what you have to say. We value your time. We’re courteous and polite to all.
Remote First — Work From Where You Are
We’re a fully remote company, with no physical premises. This, together with our virtues of Humility and Open Collaboration, has lots of implications for how we work together and how we communicate with each other. Our primary method of communication is Slack and Zoom for meetings to keep everyone connected.

Diversity Mission Statement
Docker embraces diversity and we’re wholeheartedly committed to being proactive in promoting diversity across our organization.
We’re dedicated to establishing an organization that reflects the fundamental respect for different ways of working and living, and we assure every Docker employee the opportunity to reach his or her full potential.
Current Employee Groups:Underrepresented Genders | Diversity, Equity, Inclusion & Belonging | Mental Health | Caregivers | Neurodivergent
“At Docker I’ve always felt respected and appreciated by my colleagues from the very moment I came aboard the ship several years ago. I feel super comfortable bringing my whole authentic self to work as a South Asian, Muslim, woman of color, and a new mom. I’m very proud to be able to work on revolutionary technology used by millions of developers across the world with a team of smart, talented, and down to earth people!”
Amn Rahman
Staff Data Architect
We’re Developer Obsessed!
One of our virtues is Developer Obsession and we mean it!
We know that developers are the people using Docker every day and they are who we keep in mind while making decisions. Watch as our CTO, Justin Cormack, provides an in-depth discussion on how we actively listen to developers.
