About the program
As part of the Docker Developer Preview Program, you’ll interact with the Docker team to help shape and improve the experience of millions of developers around the world. Your input will have a direct impact on how we craft experiences and identify new product opportunities.
You’ll have the opportunity to participate in research for an exclusive first look at our newest features and give us feedback on them! You’ll get direct access to the people who are building our products everyday: designers, researchers, engineering team, product managers, community leads, and more.
Most importantly, you’ll have a chance to feed directly into our product roadmap and help influence what we should do next.And, of course, there’s plenty of exclusive opportunities for Docker swag and other incentives!

FAQs:
What type of research could I be contacted for?
We may contact you for a variety of research opportunities: to complete surveys, participate in interviews, give feedback on new designs, and more. You’re under no obligation to take part, just join in when you can.
When will I be contacted?
Here at Docker, there is always something we are innovating! We tend to reach out within a few days to a few months. However, the time between when you sign up and when we contact you is variable, depending on current research and feedback needs.
What time commitment does this require?
Whatever you want! If we contact you for a research opportunity, we will let you know the amount of time it will take (typically ranging from 10-60 minutes). You can decide whether or not you want to participate based on your own schedule.
Is there compensation?
We know your time is valuable! We offer Docker swag or gift cards for taking part in our studies. Details of the study incentive will be included in the invitation to take part.
