I do not understand this relative positions in FabricJs. The docu is simple to understand, it states that setRelativeX sets the position relative to the parent, like a group. I try to use that but the actual position is all over the place.
My scene is as follows:
canvas
- Group: sceneGroup (0, 0)
- Group: red-0 (0, 0)
- Text "m1" (1881, -50)
- Text <
- Text "m2" (1775, -50)
- Text <
- Text "m3" (1011, -50)
- Text <
- Group: blue-0 (2000, 50)
- Text "m4" (786, 50)
- Text >
But the texts are all over the place.
I calculated the difference between relative pos and absolute pos and the difference is one 1000, one 1772, the other is 1885 difference. For m4 I expect the absolute pos to be 2786 (2000 + 786), but it is 2536.
What are those texts relative to?
