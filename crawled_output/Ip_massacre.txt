The events of the Ip massacre (Romanian: Masacrul din Ip, Hungarian: Ippi mészárlás) escalated in the early hours of 14 September 1940, in Ipp, (today Ip, Sălaj County), Northern Transylvania. After two Hungarian soldiers died there in an accidental explosion, rumors spread that they had been killed by Romanians. After another incident the Royal Hungarian Army, influenced by the rumor, indiscriminately massacred around 150 ethnic Romanians in the nearby locations and surrounding areas.
Events[edit]
After the Second Vienna Award of 30 August 1940, as a result of German–Italian arbitration, northwestern Transylvania reverted to Hungary. The area ceded by Romania contained the northwestern part of the homonymous region and the Székely lands. A total of eight of the 23 Transylvanian counties that had been part of Romania during the interwar period were entirely alienated, and another three were split. Thus, Sălaj County was also attached to Hungary. On 7 September 1940 the Hungarian Second Army arrived at Ipp (present-day Ip) where they made a short stop. After preparing to leave, more acquired grenades[clarification needed] exploded in one of the sling-carts and two soldiers died.
It was quickly determined that negligent storage of the grenades had caused the accident, but rumors rapidly spread that it was a willful action. [1]
On 8 September 1940, the Second Army entered the city of Zalău.[2][page needed]
On 13 September, the military commander of the district of Szilágysomlyó (present-day Șimleu Silvaniei) was informed that armed Romanian groups were looting the nearby villages of Alsókaznacs, Felsőkaznacs, Márkaszék, Porc, Lecsmér, Somály, and Kémer (present-day Cosniciu de Jos, Cosniciu de Sus, Marca, Porț, Leșmir, Șumal, and Camăr). According to the report, their number was between 80–100. Based on this report, the 32nd Regiment stationed in Zilah (present-day Zalău) assigned a group to investigate the area.
When they arrived in Szilágynagyfalu (present-day Nușfalău), they were informed of the deaths of the two soldiers.
In retaliation, they raided the commune the same day.[3]
After reconnaissance, 18 suspicious persons were found.
According to official reports, 16 were executed because of their attempts to desert.[clarification needed]. Overnight, Hungarian troops residing in the local school were shot at from the street with a machine gun around 03:00 am. Some witnesses claimed that the shooting came from a flat in the center, and five persons with machine guns were captured. In retaliation, between 152 and 158 ethnic Romanians were killed.[1][4][page needed]
The commander of the Hungarian troops, Lieutenant Zoltán Vasváry,[5]: 278, 280  perpetrated the massacre of civilians. Some sources have stated that the Hungarian Army was supported by local vigilantes.[6][page needed]
The soldiers went house-to-house, shooting indiscriminately.
On 14 September, in Somlyócsehi (present-day Cehei), one person was killed. In the nearby Felsőkaznacs and Szilágcseres forests (present-day Cosniciu de Sus and Cerișa) 55 persons were killed. According to some other sources, the area most affected was Sălaj, where 477 Romanians were massacred.[7]
On September 14, at the order of Lt. Vasvári, a pit 24 meters long by 4 meters wide was dug in the village cemetery; the corpses of those killed in the massacre were buried head-to-head in two rows, with no religious ceremony.[5]: 293
Trial[edit]
The facts were established by Decision no. 1 of the Northern Transylvania People's Tribunal (which sat in Cluj and was presided by Justice Nicolae Matei[8][9]), in a public sentence from 13 March 1946. The findings of the Tribunal were as follows:[5]: 280, 304
Lieutenant colonel Carol Lehotcsky, the military commander of Șimleu Silvaniei district, was found guilty of ordering reprisals against the Romanian inhabitants of Ip and nearby villages;[5]: 280  he received a death sentence.[5]: 304
Ștefan Farago, a landowner from Ip and commander of a local militia was accused of inducing Lehotcsky to order those repressive measures,[5]: 280  but was acquitted.[5]: 304  Adalbert Ujhaly was also found to have participated in this inducement, but he had died before the trial.[5]: 280
Lt. Zoltán Vasváry was found guilty of commanding the unit that carried out the massacre, and was sentenced to death.[5]: 280, 304
Fifteen locals were accused of cooperating with the Hungarian soldiers in perpetrating the massacre.[5]: 280  Of those, Vasile K. Bereș, Francisc I. Csepei, Arpád Ösz, and Ștefan Pinces were sentenced to 25 years of forced labor; Sigismund P. Bereș, Emeric Biro Jr., Francisc Borzási, Sigismund Csepei, Bálint Kisfaluși, and Mihai Soos to 20 years of forced labor, Alexandru Csepei to 20 years of prison, Emeric Biro Sr. and Alexandru Kisfaluși to 15 years of prison, and Nicolae Bereș to 5 years of prison, while Paul B. Fazekas was acquitted.[5]: 304
