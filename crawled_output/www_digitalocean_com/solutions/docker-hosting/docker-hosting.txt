Create a Droplet virtual machine with Docker pre-installed (docker-engine, docker-compose), in just one-click.Get StartedFrequently Asked Questions (FAQ)What is Docker hosting?
Docker hosting, or a Docker host, is a physical or virtual server (aka virtual machine) on which you run Docker. Docker runs workloads in a Docker container or Docker containers. Docker hosting allows your Docker engine to allocate portions of your hostâs computing power to these specific Docker containers while keeping each Docker container separate from each other.
Why would I use Docker hosting for my Docker containers?
If you are using Docker to help with your applicationâs deployments, youâll want to use a cloud platform or hosting platform that has experience with, and can actively host, docker containers. Docker hosting platforms will enable your application to leverage the full power of Dockerâfrom the moment you install Docker to using the Docker hub to managing your Docker images.
Many modern applications use Docker hosting platforms today because the ability to run Docker containers is very powerful when making frequent deployment changes to your application,
especially as you scale.
There are many benefits to using Docker for your deployments (and thus using Docker hosting platforms specifically for your Docker hosting or hosting in general). Some of these advantages include:
Standardization and consistency across your application, providing reproducible development, build, testing, and live production environments and loops. DigitalOcean can even improve this further by making it even easier to deploy and manage Docker containers (check out our one-click install application).
Rapid development that can reduce deployment times to mere seconds, allowing you to focus on what youâre building rather than the process of deploying what youâre building. As a hosting provider, DigitalOcean cares about your time, which should be spent on your startup, not the hassles of cloud infrastructure (e.g., server location, managing data centers, ssd storage, api access, root access, etc.). Weâll take the hassle out of your development and Docker hosting.
Cost savings from dramatic reductions in cloud infrastructure spending (especially if youâre using a typically more expensive cloud provider such as the Google Cloud Platform/Google Cloud Run or Amazon ECS). DigitalOcean offers affordable pricing for our Docker hosting platform.
Our philosophy as a Docker hosting platform is that managing your Docker containers should make your life as a builder easier.
Who offers the best Docker hosting? What are the best hosting platforms for Docker? How do I know if Iâm using the best Docker hosting?
We recommend doing your research, looking into the best Docker hosting platforms on the market, and picking the one that has the best products, services, and pricing to meet your business needs.
DigitalOceanâs Docker hosting offers many complementary services, additional features, and add-ons for businesses looking to deploy with Docker. Here are some features you may want to ensure your provider offers are:
Easy Docker installation (DigitalOcean has our one-click Docker install virtual machineâone-click Docker deployment or Docker install)
Free control planeâpaying for infrastructure with no premium for using Kubernetes (DigitalOcean Kubernetes includes the control plane for free)
A reliable operating system for hosting a Docker image and experience running containers
Managed databases that work with your Docker custom applications (out of reliable data centers so you donât need to have your own data centers)
GitHub integrations or your needed GitHub integration and edge services for edge locations
Support for multiple regions and global routing with overall high availability
Access management tools and UI for your team
Cluster monitoring and direct control when you need it
SSD storage and root access for all the containers youâre using
Custom health checks and support for your hosting, operating system, and overall build
