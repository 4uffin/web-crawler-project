By its simplest definition, prototype hosting is hosting for prototypes, or apps that are in early stages of development or testing. Oftentimes prototypes are untested ideas that require a builder to generate feedback from actual users or customers before they can know whether the idea has product market fit or is generally worth scaling.
Sometimes prototype hosting can refer to hosting specific to the class driven development Javascript framework called Prototype. DigitalOceanâs hosting solutions also can support sites built with this framework and are using its core functionality, such as custom transitions.
What tools do I need to build a prototype?
Developers building prototypes use a very wide range of tools, all of which we canât cover in a short FAQ. But if your aims are to give your application life on the internet, youâll need to host it somewhere. DigitalOcean has great hosting options for any application youâre seeking to create. We definitely believe that the best way to get feedback on the prototype you and your team is building is to test it in the world and see what user behavior your application garners.
What coding language should I use?
You can achieve your aim of building a prototype with many different coding languages, from simple languages like HTML, to more advanced languages like Python. We canât recommend the language you should code in or or what tool or tools you should use, but DigitalOcean will be here to help you deploy your application once it is ready for real customers or developers to use.
