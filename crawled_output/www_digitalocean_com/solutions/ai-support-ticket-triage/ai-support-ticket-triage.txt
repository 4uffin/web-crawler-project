With DigitalOceanâs GenAI Platform, you can build agents that automatically collect and standardize support requests from all your digital channels, including help portals, blog comments, GitHub issues, forums, and social media. These agents convert unstructured feedback into a consistent ticket format, then classify and route each request to the right team based on urgency, topic, or sentiment. The result is faster response times, fewer dropped issues, and a smoother experience for both your customers and your support team.Build your custom support agentOptimize Support Ticket ManagementTransform unstructured customer inquiries into organized, actionable tickets using AI-driven classification and routing.Start building your copilotCentralize Customer FeedbackAggregate inputs from help portals, blogs, and social media into a unified system.

Read tutorialFAQsWhat kind of support data can I connect to my agent?You can connect data from help portals, forums, blog comments, GitHub issues, social media mentions, and any other channel where your users submit feedback or requests. The GenAI Platform supports function calling, so you can fetch and feed this data into your agent in real time.
See this diagram to understand how you can implement a support ticket triage agent:
How does the agent know where to route each support ticket?Your agent can be trained using historical support tickets and tagging logic to recognize patterns and classify incoming requests. You can define routing rules based on urgency, topic, or departmentâlike sending bugs to engineering and feature requests to product.
Can I customize the ticket format and fields?Yes. The GenAI Platform lets you design the output format of your agent to match your support systemâs structure. You can include fields like category, priority level, assigned team, and summary notes.
How accurate is the classification?Accuracy improves over time with better data and model fine-tuning. You can feed in past support data to help your agent learn, and continuously monitor its decisions through built-in observability tools.
Do I need ML expertise to build this?No. The GenAI Platform is designed for developers and teams without deep machine learning backgrounds. You can use prebuilt tools to create, test, and deploy your support agent with minimal setup.
Can I ask the agent why it made a decision?Yes. With the GenAI Platformâs conversational interface, you can query your agent about how it classified a ticket, what signals it used, and why it routed it the way it didâadding transparency and trust to automated triage.
