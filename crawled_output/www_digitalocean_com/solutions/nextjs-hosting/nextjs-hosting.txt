Next.js is a flexible React framework.
React is a popular open-source JavaScript framework and library originally developed by Facebook. React was created to make it easier for developers to create interactive user interfaces and web applications with fewer lines of JavaScript code than youâd need
using regular JavaScript.
Next.js leverages the full power of React to give you the building blocks youâll need to build a web browser app even faster with deployment directly from GitHub.
Next.js applications are known to enhance:
User interfaces: Next.js allows for richer UI experiences that load and display quickly
Routing: easier navigation between various parts of your application
Data Fetching: faster retrieval of stored data and rapid serving of this data to end users
Rendering: React supports server side rendering, optimal for single-page applications with pages on a unique url in the browser
Integrations: more seamless integration of third-party tools (e.g. payment services, content management systems, folder management, etc.)
Infrastructure: easier deployment of the application (this is where DigitalOcean can help!)
Performance: faster and better performance, so your customers can seamlessly get what they need from your application
Scalability: easily scale your application as your traffic and business grows
Developer Education: improved documentation and resources that enable easier troubleshooting and implementation of advanced features
Next.js (and JavaScript React, which it is built on) can enable your application to be fully interactive, responsive, dynamic, and performant, which can lead to better outcomes for the goals of your business or projects. You can learn more about Next.js and its lead, Tim Neutkens, on the Next.js website.
Sometimes developers can easily confuse Next.js with NodeJS (sometimes referred to as Node for shorthand). If youâre looking to deploy a NodeJS application, check out our 1-click installation NodeJS application.
What React server components will I need to host my Next.js application?
While React and Next.js are modern frameworks, you typically wonât need anything particularly advanced from your hosting provider for applications built with this configuration.
Still, DigitalOcean offers comprehensive features for hosting Next.js applications, including:

Server rendering (or server side rendering) so you can rest assured that your application is rendering the right way to your applicationâs visitors with incremental static regeneration for your static site
