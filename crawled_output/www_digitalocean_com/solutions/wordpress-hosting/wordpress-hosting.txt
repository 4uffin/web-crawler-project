DigitalOcean and Cloudways are each a great WordPress host.
What is WordPress hosting?Web hosts enable you to deploy your applications (from one website to unlimited websites) to the internet. WordPress hosting is when a hosting service is tailored specific to deploying a website built on WordPress to the internet.
What are web hosts?Web hosts or hosting providers are businesses that help you deploy your application (aka WordPress sites) to the internet.
Why do so many websites use WordPress?People choose WordPress for many reasons: the software is free, itâs easy to customize with a huge range of templates and plugins, the platform is regularly updated to protect against security threats, and it supports all media types, not just text. With so many developers, agencies, and businesses using WordPress, there is high demand for cheap WordPress hosting with many looking for the best cheap WordPress hosting out there.
Why should I choose DigitalOcean and Cloudways for WordPress?WordPress hosting may not differ much from platform to platform, but DigitalOcean Droplets are particularly easy to use and simple to navigate, which helps users focus on building their dream website rather than spending hours figuring out hosting. For an even simpler, hands off managed WordPress hosting solution, we also offer Cloudways. Both DigitalOcean and Cloudways provide cheap WordPress hosting, ideal for any business looking for web hosting that is affordable, fast, and reliable.
Who offers the best cheap WordPress hosting? Who are the cheap WordPress hosting providers?There are many cheap WordPress hosting providers out there. We cannot say who offers the cheap WordPress hosting plans that best fit your needs and budget. But DigitalOceanâs Droplet plans are cheap WordPress hosting and Cloudways managing hosting solutions are cheap WordPress hosting. We hope you will consider eachâs cheap WordPress hosting plans as you create your list of affordable WordPress hosting providers under consideration.
We also pride ourselves on being cheap WordPress hosts that also offer some of the fastest WordPress hosting out there. Try both DigitalOcean and Cloudways for free to see if our cheap Wordpress hosting plans are right for you. We may be biased, but we think our DigitalOcean Droplets and Cloudways managed web hosting are some of the best cheap Wordpress hosting options out there.
Try us outâwe hope youâll agree that we are one of the best cheap WordPress hosting providers with the great cheap WordPress hosting services on the internet.
Does DigitalOcean offer a free domain? Does Cloudways offer a free domain?Both our DigitalOcean Droplet offerings and our Cloudways managed hosting donât offer a free domain with purchase plans. Weâre hosting providers (web hosts) who are focused on providing cheap WordPress hosting services.
Selling domain names is not one of our services. While there are some WordPress hosting providers who sell domains or even offer a free domain for some amount of websites (e.g., for up to three websites), we recommend investigating the performance, service, reliability, and security of each web host you review as it is easy to purchase a domain name (or find a free domain), but it is less easy to provide reliable and fast WordPress hosting.
Generally, we always caution our customers and potential customers to look deeper into any hosting plan that includes lots of âfreeâ benefits (e.g., free domain / free domain name, free ssl certificate, free cdn, unmetered bandwidth or unlimited bandwidth, etc.). Benefits such as a free domain or unlimited bandwidth can sound great, but again you need to make sure your actual WordPress websites run as they should with all the WordPress specific features youâre looking for.
No free domain is worth giving up the WordPress hosting performance you need for your website to succeed - you donât want your website visitors to experience a slow site (low site speed). DigitalOcean and Cloudways are cheap WordPress hosts, but also WordPress hosts with high performance, even with our most basic plan.
What are 1-click Marketplace apps?The DigitalOcean Marketplace allows you to build your websites and applications faster with preconfigured, 1-Click Apps for popular content management systems including Wordpress (basically get WordPress pre-installed), Plesk, CyberPanel, Ghost, developer tools such as Docker and Dokku, and databases such as MongoDB and MySQL.
These 1-Click Apps are preconfigured environments with all the prerequisites you need to get started, saving you time on your website hosting.

Where should I go when I need help after installing? (Support & Community)There are two places to go for help if you have questions after installing WordPress on your Droplet:
DigitalOcean Community: Get your question answered by expert developers and see answers to other usersâ questions about nearly every development topic.
DigitalOcean Support: Contact DigitalOcean Support for direct help from our robust, responsive support team who can help you solve specific issues related to your Droplet.
If you are using Cloudways, Cloudways also has great documentation and 24/7/365 support (even for the most basic plan).
How does DigitalOcean and Cloudways compare to WP Engine?WP Engine is also a hosting provider or web host with a hosting plan geared towards WordPress. We believe that our DigitalOcean and Cloudways offerings are very competitive, but weâd encourage you to explore which hosting plan is the right one for you. Sometimes the cheapest web hosting plan isnât necessarily the best plan.
Where can I find the best cheap WordPress plans?We may be biased, but we strongly recommend checking out our Cloudways cheap hosting and our WordPress plans on DigitalOcean virtual machines called Droplets.
