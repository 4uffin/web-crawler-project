What customers think about DigitalOcean hosting
âWhen I was running performance tests when starting DigitalOcean, you were one of few providers using SSDs as the default for images, which provided extra speed. This put you ahead of the competition because half of them were still using HDDs as the standard.â

What is cPanel?
cPanel is a Linux-based control dashboard that enables developers and other website or application builders to manage their web hosting using an intuitive graphical user interface, rather than running complex commands through the Linux command line. While advanced users may be comfortable managing their virtual private server using more advanced tools, for those with less technical knowledge or experience managing and maintaining servers, cPanel provides an easy way for users to manage their hosting solution.
What is cPanel hosting?
cPanel hosting is web hosting on a Linux-based virtual machine or virtual server that includes an installation of cPanel to manage the server. Many shared hosting providers offer cPanel as a way for users to manage their web hosting, and cPanel can also be installed on top of both shared and dedicated servers as a management layer. For example, DigitalOcean offers a Marketplace application that enables users to install cPanel & UHM for an Ubuntu-based server. Once a user spins up a Droplet with cPanel installed, they can utilize the cPanel interface to manage websites, applications, and more.
What are DigitalOceanâs cPanel web hosting plans?
DigitalOcean offers multiple web hosting plans for DigitalOcean Droplets, which cPanel hosting can be installed on. DigitalOcean Droplets come in configurations including virtual machines that are optimized for CPU, optimized for memory, and those that have a balance of memory and CPU power. DigitalOcean cPanel hosting plans start at just $4/month and include a generous amount of bandwidth and a low cost for bandwidth overages. You can choose the cPanel hosting plan that best works for you when you sign up for DigitalOcean and first spin up a Droplet virtual machine.
Is DigitalOceanâs cPanel hosting fully managed or self-managed?
DigitalOceanâs cPanel hosting is self-managed by default. You are responsible for server maintenance, software updates, security configurations, and managing cPanel itself. However, DigitalOcean provides documentation, a 1-click cPanel install via the Marketplace, and optional premium support plans if you need more hands-on help.
Can I install multiple websites on a single cPanel instance?
Yes, you can host multiple websites on a single cPanel instance by using the Add-on Domains or subdomains feature in cPanel. This is especially useful for developers or small businesses managing several sites from one server. Keep in mind that the performance will depend on the underlying Dropletâs resources (CPU, RAM, bandwidth). If youâre managing many resource-intensive sites, you may want to scale up to a larger Droplet.
Does cPanel hosting support email services like Webmail or third-party email hosting?
Yes, cPanel includes built-in support for email services such as Webmail, POP3, IMAP, and SMTP, so you can create and manage email accounts directly from your domain. You can access these emails through cPanelâs Webmail clients like Roundcube or Horde. Alternatively, you can use third-party email providers like Google Workspace or Zoho Mail by updating DNS settings in cPanel. This gives you flexibility depending on your business needs and preference for email tools.
What are the best cPanel hosting solutions?
There are many cPanel hosting solutions available today, and the best cPanel hosting service is the one that best suits your unique needs. Some web hosting providers will come with cPanel already installed as the server management tool, while other web hosting providers including DigitalOcean require you to add cPanel when you set up your server. DigitalOcean also enables you to easily create a cPanel web hosting service through our Marketplace application for cPanel hosting, which installs cPanel on Ubuntu on a virtual machine. To create a cPanel hosting account on DigitalOcean, sign up for our hosting services today.
Does DigitalOcean provide a free domain or free SSL certificates?
DigitalOcean does not provide a free domain for your cPanel hosting, but you can connect your domain from common domain registrars to DigitalOcean easily. DigitalOcean does not provide a free SSL certificate but enables you to use SSL certificates that you have purchased from commercial entities or use Letâs Encrypt which provides free SSL certificates that can be installed on our web servers. While you wonât get a free domain or free SSL certificate using DigitalOcean, DigitalOcean does provide a reliable, cost-effective solution with dedicated hosting plans, unlike other web hosts that may only provide shared hosting plans.
Does DigitalOcean provide WordPress hosting?
DigitalOcean provides WordPress hosting through our Droplet virtual machines, which WordPress can be installed on either manually or through our 1-click application for WordPress Hosting. DigitalOcean also offers managed web hosting for WordPress through Cloudways. Using Cloudways, those looking for WordPress hosting can easily create a server and add WordPress without having to manage or maintain servers yourself.
What products does DigitalOcean offer in addition to cPanel web hosting?
DigitalOcean is a web host that offers a comprehensive suite of solutions in addition to cPanel hosting, including Managed Databases (MongoDB, MySQL databases, PostgreSQL, and Redis), Managed Kubernetes, volume storage, block storage, load balancing, a Platform as a Service solution, and functions or serverless solution. You can use DigitalOcean not only as your cPanel host but also for many of your other cloud computing needs, such as managing your mySQL databases, using storage services to upload files, and more.
Does DigitalOcean provide automatic backups for cPanel hosting?
DigitalOcean offers manual and automated backups for Droplets, but backups for cPanel itself need to be configured separately within your cPanel account. You can enable DigitalOcean Droplet backups for weekly snapshots or use cPanelâs built-in backup tools to schedule and manage site-level backups. Based on your application, you might use both options to ensure redundancy and recovery. Note that DigitalOceanâs backup service incurs an additional cost (20% of the Droplet price).
