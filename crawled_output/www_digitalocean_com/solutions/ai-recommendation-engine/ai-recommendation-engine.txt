In hiring use cases, that means handling both structured data, like job titles, skills, or years of experience, and unstructured data, like resume summaries or job descriptions. Large language models excel at understanding and connecting both types of data to uncover meaningful patterns. This foundation lets you create intelligent, personalized recommendations for both candidates and recruiters.Build your custom recommendation agentHow the GenAI Recommendation Engine WorksTo build this system, youâll orchestrate a set of agents with specialized roles, powered by embeddings, knowledge bases, and functions that work together behind the scenes. Here's how you'd structure it for a job matching site.
Create your own agentAgents coordinate tasksA multi-agent architecture allows different agents to specialize in specific parts of the recommendation pipeline, like extracting resume features or conducting job searches. This structure help to ensure tasks are efficiently delegated and parallelized, improving speed and scalability as your dataset grows.
Embeddings power semantic understandingBy converting job descriptions and resumes into vector embeddings, the system captures the deeper meaning and context of unstructured text. This allows for more accurate matches beyond keyword overlap, enabling recommendations based on similar skills, experiences, or career trajectories.
Knowledge bases store vectorized dataEach agent accesses a dedicated knowledge base that houses pre-processed and vectorized job and resume data. These knowledge bases enable fast, intelligent retrieval during search and recommendation tasks, ensuring responses are both relevant and real-time.
Functions handle structured dataTo complement semantic search, structured dataâsuch as years of experience, job location, or certification, is extracted and stored separately. Dedicated functions ensure this information is always accessible and up-to-date, providing additional precision in matching criteria.

Read tutorialFAQsWhat is a recommendation engine, and how does it work?A recommendation engine is an AI-powered system that analyzes user behavior, preferences, and content to deliver personalized recommendations. These engines often combine collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and real-time data processing to uncover patterns in customer data and make relevant AI suggestionsâlike matching job seekers with roles based on resumes and job descriptions.
What are the potential benefits of using an AI recommendation engine for recruiting?An AI recommendation engine may help you automate and optimize hiring by delivering real-time insights into the best job-candidate matches. It can help reduce manual sorting, accelerate hiring decisions, and improve match quality by combining AI pattern recognition, data gathering, and semantic search. The result: more efficient, AI-driven recommendations that benefit both job seekers and recruiters. Please note that when using AI agents to help you further automate hiring workflows, it is essential to build safeguards and guardrails that mitigate bias and ensure transparency in decision-making, helping to preserve fairness throughout the process.
Can I customize a recommendation engine on DigitalOcean to fit my business needs?Yes, by building a recommendation engine on DigitalOceanâs GenAI Platform, you can fully customize it. You can fine-tune the model using your own data, adjust the parameters, and integrate it with your existing systems to align with your unique business objectives and processes.
How does DigitalOceanâs AI recommendation engine work?DigitalOceanâs GenAI Platform enables the creation of AI agents that leverage large language models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to deliver personalized recommendations. By integrating structured and unstructured data, such as job titles, resumes, and job descriptions, into a knowledge base, the engine can generate context-aware suggestions. Additionally, features like function calling allow the agent to access external APIs or models, enhancing its ability to provide accurate and relevant recommendations.
