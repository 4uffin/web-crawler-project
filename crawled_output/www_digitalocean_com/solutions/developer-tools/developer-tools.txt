Developers building developer tools use a very wide range of tools, all of which we canât cover in a short FAQ. But if your aims are to give your application life on the internet, youâll need to host it somewhere. DigitalOcean has great hosting options for any application youâre seeking to create. We definitely believe that the best way to get feedback on the prototype you and your team is building is to test it in the world and see what user behavior your application garners.
What coding language should I use?
You can achieve your aim of building developer tools with many different coding languages, from simple languages like HTML, to more advanced languages like Python. We canât recommend the language you should code in or or what tool or tools you should use, but DigitalOcean will be here to help you deploy your application once it is ready for real customers or developers to use.
