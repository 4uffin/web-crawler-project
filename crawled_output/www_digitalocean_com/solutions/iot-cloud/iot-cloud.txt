Explore all our DropletsGet started right awayFrequently Asked Questions (FAQ)What is IoT (Internet of Things)?
IoT or the internet of things is a category of technology that pertains to physical devices (e.g., technology embedded in consumer products such as smart appliances). Typically IoT applications will have some unique requirements and needs that other kinds of tech businesses might not have. These needs could include:
Device management tools for the IoT solution user or builder
Device data storage, data transfer, data security, and general IoT data management
General device connectivity across any and all connected solutions
Cloud IoT integration (which is where DigitalOcean can help!)
Stability measures to prevent issues with unplanned downtime or inability to connect
And sometimes even artificial intelligence and machine learning
Many consider IoT applications a major digital transformation of the last few decades, and with this comes the need for improved IoT integration, IoT data management, and device connectivity with the cloud. Again, this is where DigitalOceanâs services and solutions can come in to support your IoT applications and ensure your customers have the best IoT experience possible.
