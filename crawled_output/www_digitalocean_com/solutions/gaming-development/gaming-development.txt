The high availability control plane is a great addition, as it means we can be even more confident in the availability of hardware provided by you. Weâve never had an availability issue from DigitalOcean.Stephen LazarionokCo-founder and CTO, ZingBrain AIThe fact that itâs so easy to configure, administrate and scale with DigitalOcean is something which I love. Iâve worked with Kubernetes before, hands-on, self-hosted, but the DigitalOcean integration and provision of Kubernetes has been the most seamless that Iâve experienced so far.James HookerCTO, Hack the BoxThe cost and time savings DigitalOcean has given us have been critical to our growth. Because weâre such a small team, we can spend our time building features and supporting the rest of the company instead of dealing with infrastructure problems, so thatâs had a big impact on the company overall.Marko Å irecLead Backend Engineer, Blub Blub123Resources for building a successful gameDigitalOceanâs technical tutorials, product documentation, and library of resources can answer common questions about building and scaling your game. Tech Talk: Modern Game Server Infrastructure in the CloudTutorial: How To Install pygame and Create a Template for Developing Games in Python 3Why many network-intensive services run on DigitalOceanFAQsWhat is game server hosting?A game server is a server that acts as a definitive source of events for multiplayer video games. Players use these servers to maintain their own version of the virtual world and transmit data to other players within the game. The player can either host their own server at home or run a game server hosting through a cloud provider.
How do I install a game server on DigitalOcean?
Create a DigitalOcean account.
Choose a Droplet plan that fits your needs. You can also explore using App Platform to easily host static sites.
Install the required software packages and set up the firewall.
Download the latest version of the game to the server.
Open the game runfile and configure any server settings.
Set up a protocol for the server to continuously run
Connect to the gameâs runtime server
What backup options are available for game servers?DigitalOceanâs Droplets can access Volumes block storage for backup options.
How do I optimize my game server for low latency?For low latency, players should ensure their hardware has enough dedicated computing power, such as high-clock speed CPUs with multiple cores, and use solid-state drives (SSD) for more efficient storage. Beyond hardware configuration, having a game server hosted in a data center means traffic is routed through the nearest networking hub, automatically providing low-latency game servers.
How do I reduce lag and tick rate on my game server?Both lag and tick rate can affect the overall user experience and make gaming less enjoyable. Lag is the latency between user command and game action. There are three main types of lag: server lag, client lag, and connection lag. The tick rate is how often the game refreshes itself. The average tick rate changes depending on the specific game, but itâs essential to track for a smooth user experience.
For reduced lag and tick rate on a game server, itâs important to optimize server resources, minimize the number of mod and custom game files, have a stable network connection, and use profiling tools to catch performance bottlenecks.
DigitalOceanâs Droplets can provide dedicated computing power, multi-thread vCPUs, managed load balancers, performance metrics, and regional availability to reduce overall lag and increase tick rate for a smoother gaming experience.
Can I install mods and custom game files?Yes. DigitalOceanâs Droplets can support custom game files and modifications with its various Linux-based operating systems for cloud game servers. The Marketplace also has 1-click apps that you can add to your game server.
How do I set up a modding-friendly game server?A modding-friendly server is a game server that allows gamers to join the game, use current game mods, and add modifications of their own to the server. To ensure that players can have a more customized gaming experience that supports regular mods, be sure to:
Use a reliable hosting provider
Test mods before they are put into production
Regularly monitor performance
Frequently backup files
Talk with the community
