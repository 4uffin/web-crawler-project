Get started with CloudwaysGet started on DigitalOceanFrequently Asked Questions (FAQ)What is e-commerce hosting?
E-commerce hosting is simply web hosting for any online business (including e-commerce website) that sells goods through the web. E-commerce hosting providers are companies like DigitalOcean, and our managed hosting service Cloudways, which provides hosting to these e-commerce businesses. Cloudways is a great hosting platform to quickly launch e-commerce stores.
Is e-commerce hosting different from regular web hosting?
E-commerce hosting is not fundamentally different from web hosting or managed web hosting (web hosting provided by services such as Cloudways by DigitalOcean that manage your hosting for you). E-commerce sites may require more from their e-commerce hosting than other kinds of businesses though. For example better security (e.g., in the form of SSL certificates), better customer support, and better backups.
Who offers the best hosting?
There are many e-commerce web hosts that offer e-commerce web hosting â there is no one best e-commerce hosting solution. We may be biased, but we think DigitalOcean offers great hosting for any e-commerce business either through our virtual machines product, Droplets, or through our managed hosting service, Cloudways.
Do I need e-commerce hosting solutions to launch my online store?
To have an online store, youâll need your online store hosted by a hosting provider who offers e-commerce hosting solutions. Without a hosting provider, you wonât be able to deploy your e-commerce website to the internet and thus begin selling at your online store. But choosing a hosting platform for your online store doesnât need to be an intimidating process. Our Cloudways managed hosting is a great service for anyone launching an online store who wants all the hassle of hosting managed for them by a trusted hosting provider.
Cloudways can help your online store or e-commerce website (or e-commerce websites) run and scale on the web in a few easy clicks!
Is there a difference between e-commerce hosting and WordPress hosting?
While e-commerce hosting refers to web hosting for any e-commerce store, hosting for WordPress specifically refers to e-commerce hosting for a WordPress online store. Cloudways by DigitalOcean offers managed hosting specific to WordPress websites, including online stores that use WooCommerce (so are looking for WooCommerce hosting). Many of Cloudwaysâ users came to us for WooCommerce hosting, and we are excited to offer WooCommerce hosting as a part of our managed hosting offering. Whether you are looking for help with a general e-commerce store, Wordpress, or WooCommerce hosting, DigitalOcean and Cloudways have you covered.
Does DigitalOcean offer free SSL certificates or unlimited bandwidth with your solution?
DigitalOcean offers practically unlimited bandwidth and many security features including SSL certificates and automated backups as well as performance features like a content delivery network (CDN), and much more. A content delivery network might be important for your online business, especially if you have a content-heavy website (a content delivery network is valuable for this). DigitalOcean and Cloudways will provide you these security and performance features (e.g., like the content delivery network) as part of our services.
Other e-commerce hosting plans from other providers might claim to offer benefits like unlimited bandwidth or a free ssl certificate, but often these offers come with hefty fees or other strings attached. If you see another service promoting benefits like unlimited bandwidth, it might be good to do a little bit of research.
