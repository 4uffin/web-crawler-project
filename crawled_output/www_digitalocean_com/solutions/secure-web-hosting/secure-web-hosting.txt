Secure web hosting is web hosting provided by a web hosting service that emphasizes important security features you might need as you grow your business.
Secure web hosting services are not a guarantee with every hosting provider. Research the hosting providers youâre considering to ensure they have the secure hosting features you need.
Some of these security features might include:
A dedicated server offering where you can choose to have dedicated servers just for your business or application
Free SSL certificate or SSL certificates that ensure only the users or admins youâve approved can access your servers and applications
Virtual private server (VPS hosting) that ensures, even if youâre using shared web hosting, that your virtual server allocation is private and protected from others on the shared hosting server.
Web application firewall to block out any undesirable or harmful traffic or access attempts
Other key website security features or advanced security options such as secure sockets layer, secure servers, automatic backups, two-factor authentication, spam protection, DDoS protection (distributed denial of service against unauthorized users aka DDoS attacks), and more.
DigitalOcean is a great secure web hosting option as we offer all of the above web hosting security features and many web hosting services generally.
How do I know if the web hosting service I use is using secure hosting best practices?
There are many great hosting plans and hosting services out there, but not all of them will emphasize secure web hosting. DigitalOcean does, and you can see this in all the secure web hosting service features we offer and include in our hosting service.
If you are considering a different web hosting service, look for the above website security features on the website of that web hosting company. If their web hosting service doesnât cover the best web hosting security practices, and if website security is important to you, consider looking elsewhere for your hosting service.
Secure web hosting is complicated, which is why your web hosting provider needs to have experience in secure hosting. We hope you will consider DigitalOcean for your secure web hosting service as your hosting company.
Beyond secure web hosting, does it matter which website builder I use?
You can build your website from scratch or use popular website builders like WordPress. Either way, youâll want to keep security in mind.
While choosing from secure web hosting services for your web hosting is a critical choice for security, how you build the application itself can greatly impact what features you might need from your secure hosting (e.g., shared server vs dedicated server, hosting plans with a free SSL certificate, VPS hosting, etc.)
What other considerations should I have when choosing hosting services?
There is much more to web hosting than just security. Web hosts can offer many different kinds of web hosting services that emphasize different cloud hosting solutions, for example:
Hosting services with an emphasis on secure hosting: offering hosting plans that include dedicated servers, a web application firewall, a free SSL certificate, DDoS protection, SSH access, two-factor authentication, and other protections meant to deal with security threats such as cyber attacks.
Hosting companies with hosting plans emphasizing reliability or performance: a focus on server location or data centers location and customer support for when you need help from a support team.
Web hosting services focused on cost: offering hosting plans with affordable web hosting deals or discounts, monetary benefits like a money back guarantee. However, it is important to make sure that cost-focused providers are still offering high quality services beyond just savings or a money back guarantee.
Hosting services focused on a specific kind of website builder (e.g., managed WordPress hosting or linux based web servers). WordPress hosting plans are particularly common.
Assess your needs to decide what kind of cloud hosting fits your web applications.

What is the difference between dedicated hosting and shared hosting?
A web host can offer both dedicated hosting and shared hosting (sometimes referred to as same server hosting), and it is important for you to know whether the web host you choose is among web hosting companies with dedicated or shared web hosting offerings.
Dedicated hosting is when an application has a server entirely to itself or a business has dedicated hosting on a server for only its applications.
Shared hosting is when multiple users share the same web server (hence the term âshared hostingâ). Shared hosting can be a great option for businesses looking to reduce the amount theyâre spending with their hosting providers. But with shared hosting comes the important consideration of security and privacy.
The best web hosting deals for shared hosting will typically include web security benefits to ensure the proper security measures are in place to prevent any single business on the shared hosting from accessing any other separate business on the same web server. Many hosting providers offer shared hosting (some as a default for their hosting packages), but youâll want to ensure your plan is shared hosting secure/site secure.
Both dedicated hosting and shared hosting have pros and cons that are worth exploring across the web hosting providers you are considering. Weâd encourage you in either case to consider the security measures in place (especially if you are looking for advanced security features).
What are SSL certificates?
An SSL certificate is a way to authenticate a websiteâs identity and enable an encrypted connection. Thus the SSL certificate ensures that user data is secure and website ownership is verifiedâonly an admin with an SSL certificate can make changes to your application or your cloud hosting.
We highly recommend finding a dedicated hosting provider who will provide an SSL certificate for your use. Many web hosting companies will offer this as part of the advanced security features that come with their hosting packages. DigitalOceanâs hosting packages are no exception.
Which hosting provider offers the best web hosting?
There are so many hosting plans out there and the best one will depend on your businessâs needs.
We hope you will consider the hosting plans offered by DigitalOcean.
