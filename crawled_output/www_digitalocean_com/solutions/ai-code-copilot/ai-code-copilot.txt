Read tutorialFAQsWhat is a code copilot?A code copilot is an AI-powered coding assistant that helps developers write, review, and debug code more efficiently. It uses advanced AI code generation, code analysis, and coding patterns to offer intelligent suggestions, code completions, and even perform AI refactoring. A good AI coding assistant integrates directly into your development workflow and continuously learns from your codebase.
See this diagram to understand how you can implement a code copilot on:
How can I build a code copilot on DigitalOcean?You can use DigitalOceanâs GenAI Platform to create a custom AI code assistant tailored to your repositories. By setting up a knowledge base and choosing a model optimized for AI codingâlike Claude or DeepSeekâyou enable your assistant to support AI code generation, Automated Code Reviews, and Function Calling. It can also integrate with your IDE and Git workflow, giving you a seamless AI powered coding assistant.
How can an AI coding assistant help with debugging and testing?An AI for debugging code can detect bugs through error analysis and suggest precise fixes based on learned coding patterns. It can also execute test scripts, run test cases, and flag problematic code segments. With capabilities like AI refactoring and AI code generation, your assistant becomes a proactive part of your QA process.
Can this AI coding solution integrate with my current development workflow?Yes! Your code copilot can plug into popular IDEs like VS Code and JetBrains through native IDE integration. You can also use Function Calling and webhooks to connect it with your GitHub or GitLab reposâallowing your AI coding assistant to respond to branch merges, review pull requests, and stay synced with your development pipeline.
What models work best for AI code generation and automated reviews?Anthropicâs Claude models are leaders in AI code generation and reasoning, making them ideal for complex code tasks and Automated Code Reviews. DeepSeek is another powerful AI code generation tool with strong logic and code understanding. Both are supported on DigitalOcean and work seamlessly as the backbone of your AI powered coding assistant.
How does knowledge base training improve the AI code assistant?By feeding your AI code assistant with your codebase, style guides, and test examples, you help it learn your teamâs unique approach to development. This enables more relevant AI code completions, better AI debugging, and smarter suggestions that align with your coding standards. It essentially transforms your AI coding assistant into a subject matter expert for your specific environment.
