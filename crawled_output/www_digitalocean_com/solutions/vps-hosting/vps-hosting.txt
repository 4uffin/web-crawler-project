A Virtual Private Server (VPS) is a type of virtual machine that mimics the experience of a dedicated physical server by splitting a physical server âvirtually,â enabling multiple users to create their own virtual servers on one physical server. While multiple Virtual Private Servers are hosted on one physical server, each VPS is completely private, meaning it can run independent operating systems, and has its own dedicated memory. Many VPS hosting solutions include dedicated CPU, or, for low-traffic applications, users can select a shared-CPU VPS for a lower cost. VPS hosting is much more cost-effective for the vast majority of businesses than buying, configuring, and maintaining physical servers. Additionally, users can scale up their virtual private servers quickly by either adding memory to a single VPS or by creating additional VPS instances with their preferred VPS provider.
What is the difference between VPS and shared hosting?
Shared hosting is another popular way of hosting websites and applications, and has a few key differences from VPS hosting. With shared hosting, a user shares the majority of resources, including memory and CPU, with other websites or applications on the host. This can result in a decrease in performance if another application experiences a traffic surge. Using a shared hosting solution also does not give users root access to the server, which means you have less control over your server. VPS hosting providers users a fully dedicated virtual server with root access, so even though your VPS is on the same physical machine as other virtual private servers, you have much more control over the configuration of the server, and do not have to share resources with others.
What projects can I use VPS hosting for?
VPS hosting is private, secure, and gives users dedicated resources and control over their virtual machines. Almost any type of website or application today can benefit from using VPS hosting, especially when utilizing a provider such as DigitalOcean which provides a range of options for CPU-intensive, memory-intensive, and storage-intensive applications. While very low-traffic applications such as personal websites can use shared hosting solutions, VPS hosting gives all users more control over their server configurations. Some common uses for VPS hosting include:
Website and blog hosting
eCommerce stores
Video streaming
Gaming platforms
Software as a Service solutions
Databases
Microservices
Machine learning and artificial intelligence
