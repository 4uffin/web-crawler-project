Dropshipping is a type of order fulfillment where an e-commerce store doesnât hold the products its online business is selling readily available in stock. Instead, online stores will purchase the inventory they need from their wholesaler or manufacturer exactly when they need it to meet the demands and orders from their customers.
Dropshipping businesses are either online retailers utilizing dropshipping, or the e-commerce platforms that serve as the dropshipping vendors to other dropshipping stores.
To end-users (aka the customer making the purchase), it is often not obvious which of the online stores they make purchases from are a dropshipping store or not.
Which ecommerce platform is best for starting a dropshipping business?
There are many e-commerce platforms that support dropshipping. A very common e-commerce platform used for this is WordPress and their payments product WooCommerce. We built Cloudways to serve your e-commerce business no matter what e-commerce platform you choose, but we have a lot of experience with WordPress e-commerce websites.
