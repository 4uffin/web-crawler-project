What is web hosting?
Web hosting is an online service that allows for the website youâve built to be made available on the internet to website visitors. Every website you visit online needs web hosting to store the various files, including code, pictures, videos, and more, that makes up a complete website.
DigitalOcean is a web hosting provider that offers many web hosting services that enable your website to run faster, more securely, and at an affordable price. Cloudways, our managed web hosting offering, makes it even easier for you to launch your website by taking the management of your web hosting infrastructure off of your plate. Digitalocean offers performant and affordable web hosting for freelancers, so you can reliably host your website using a simple cloud solution.
