Apple pay requires a Safari browser. For additional payment options, including wire transfer, purchase orders, and ACH, please contact us. Note that when you add a card, we may send a temporary pre-authorization request to the issuing bank. This pre-authorization charge is immediately released by DigitalOcean but may take a few days to clear from your card depending on the bank.When will my card be charged?DigitalOcean billing cycles are monthly. Typically, on the first day of each month we invoice and automatically charge your account's primary payment method for the previous month's usage. In some cases, we might charge if your usage exceeds a threshold. You can also login and self pay the balance at any time.Am I charged when I enter my credit card?No. Your card is only charged at the end of the billing cycle or upon exceeding a usage threshold. Pre-authorization charge: When you add a card, we may send a preauthorization request to the issuing bank. This is to verify that the card being added has been issued by the bank and that they will authorize any charges in future. These temporary pre-authorizations are typically $1 but can vary in range and are immediately canceled by us. Depending on your bank, it might take a few days for the charge to clear from the card.Will taxes be included in my monthly invoice?We're required by law to apply taxes in some countries. Click here to learn whether we collect taxes in your country, what the tax rate is, etc.How do I destroy my resources?Check out the docs to learn how to destroy Droplets, Kubernetes clusters, Managed Databases clusters (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Caching), Spaces, Volumes , Firewalls , and Load Balancers.Can I be notified if my bill exceeds a threshold?Yes, you can set up billing alerts and we will email you if the monthly spending exceeds an amount you specify.I got a $200 credit when I opened an account. When will my card be charged?Your card will be charged only after you have utilized the free credits. For example, if you received a $200 credit for 60 days, then that $200 credit is automatically applied to your account. If you spend $25 in that timeframe, then your card will not be charged. If you spend $300, then the $200 credit would be fully utilized and your card will be charged only $100. Since the credit is valid for 60 days, you won't be able to use any remaining credit after 60 days.What's the price for the Marketplace 1-Click Apps?We charge you for the underlying compute on which the 1-Click Apps runs.How do I remove my card from the account?To remove a saved payment method, visit the products billing page and click the â¦ menu of the payment method, then click Delete. In the Confirm Delete Card window that opens, click Delete to remove the card. You cannot remove the default payment method on the account.Can I prepay for my resources?If you are interested in prepayment for resources, contact our experts.Can I have a refund?We do not offer refunds.
