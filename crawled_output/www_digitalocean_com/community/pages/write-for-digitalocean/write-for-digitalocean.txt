These authors then receive a personal payout and select a tech-focused charity to receive a donation.What topics are you looking for?Our tutorials help developers at all levels solve problems, answer questions, and do things they couldnât do before with open-source software.For Write for DOnations, weâre looking for practical guides covering open-source software and Linux/Unix-like systems, including production installations, deployments, containers, and automation. Weâre especially interested in:Basic Linux system administrationAre you a whiz at setting up SSH keys? Are you the one people come to when they canât find a file? Is your knowledge of environmental variables the envy of all? Share what you know by submitting a tutorial about system administration.Linux toolsAre you a grep power user? Do you use Rsync to make backups a breeze? Are your systemd service files second to none? Help others reach your level of expertise by proposing a tutorial about Linux tools.Docker tutorialsDo you make YAML files in Docker Compose that are works of art? Do you excel at keeping your Docker images clean ? Does your Docker monitoring leave no container in the shadows? Give the community the benefit of your experience by writing a tutorial about Docker.Security topicsDo you have fun configuring firewalls? Is WireGuard part of your standard toolbox? Have you got Suricata on speed dial? Help others secure their installations by submitting a tutorial about security.TIP: Our tutorials focus on providing a series of steps to solve a specific problem. Each step is explained thoroughly so that readers are always aware of what the code or commands do, and gives them enough information that they can adapt the process to their own situations.As an example, check out the tutorial, Initial Server Setup with Ubuntu 20.04. This tutorial features a set of discrete steps. In each step, the reader is directed to take a specific action, which is given in the step title, and the result is described. The emphasis is on what the reader is doing, rather than describing the technology involved.What is the payout structure?Authors receive $400 per tutorial upon publication. The author then selects a single tech-focused charity or nonprofit or a group of nonprofits united by similar missions to receive a donation from DigitalOcean.New tutorials are paid $400. Updates for existing tutorials, such as distribution changes, are typically paid out at $100. All payouts are at editorial discretion.Additionally, for each new article that is approved and accepted, DigitalOcean will make a $25 donation to the charity selected by the author.What people are sayingI had a great experience writing an article for the DigitalOcean Community. The editors set clear expectations and worked with me to make the tutorial the best it could be. I loved being able to contribute to a resource that I use frequently myself.Radek Pazdera, 2021If you are looking forward to upskilling yourself through writing impactful articles, this is the place to be. The amazing style guide will set you on the right track to start with and then the detailed review and feedback will polish your article to make the best of it.

If weâre interested in your proposal, weâll either accept it as is or work with you to refine it further.Once we agree on the topic and outline, weâll send you a contract to sign which lets us publish your work. Thatâs also when weâll ask for your contact and payment details.Then youâll begin writing in Markdown, turning your outline into a full article. When your article is done, we ask that you thoroughly test it by reading through it and following it as a reader would. We will provide testing credit for this. You wonât have to incur any cost to test your tutorials.When your draft is complete and tested, youâll submit it to us, and the draft will be entered into our editorial queue. All submitted drafts enter the queue in the order we receive them. We sometimes have higher than normal volumes of tutorials, so it may take a little time before an editor can work on your draft.When an editor is available, theyâll contact you to let you know theyâve started working on your tutorial, and will then verify that your tutorial is technically correct by following it as written. Our editors all have technical backgrounds and will look for technical best practices as they test your article.If everything works as written, your editor will then do a thorough review of the structure, tone, and style of your article. When theyâre done, they will provide editorial feedback on your article and send you feedback.When you receive the feedback, youâll address it and send it back.Your editor will then review it again, sending it back to you if there are further revisions necessary. Once there are no more revisions to make, another editor on the team reviews the tutorial for formatting and other issues.Once your article is ready for publication, weâll publish the tutorial, send you the link, and process your payment. Your editor will then encourage you to submit another tutorial idea.I have a tutorial thatâs already published.

We look for clear explanations, strong writing ability, and solid teaching skills. Our tutorials are aimed at all audiences, and we strongly prefer writing samples that follow our tutorial style.
