In a public cloud, cloud providers like DigitalOcean, help deliver your IT resources and manage your infrastructure for you.While choosing a public cloud may mean you are sharing some of your cloud computing resources with other organizations, DigitalOcean offers security and protection to ensure that no one but you has access to your cloud platform even in the public cloud.
