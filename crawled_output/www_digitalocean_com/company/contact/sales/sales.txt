If we were to use AWS for everything, our costs would be around $55,000 more per month than they are with DigitalOcean. We wouldnât be able to compete in certain products.David ShifleyCTO, RouteTrustThe biggest impact on Coursicle â and why weâre staying with DigitalOcean â is the way they flipped typical customer service behavior on its head. DigitalOceanâs support team would spend extra time checking whether we were satisfied. Theyâd send follow ups to make sure everything was good. They cared about building a good experience for us.Joe PuccioCofounder of CoursicleWe partnered with DigitalOcean because of the similarity of our target audiences, the goal of DigitalOceanâs technology partnerships, and the importance of building the best DevOps experience for our customers.Douglas CherryCofounder of Snapt123CompanyAboutLeadershipBlogCareersCustomersPartnersReferral ProgramAffiliate ProgramPressLegalPrivacy PolicySecurityInvestor RelationsProductsOverviewDropletsKubernetesFunctionsApp PlatformGradientâ¢ AI GPU DropletsGradientâ¢ AI Bare Metal GPUsGradientâ¢ AI 1-Click Models Gradientâ¢ AI PlatformLoad BalancersManaged DatabasesSpacesBlock StorageAPIUptimeIdentity and Access ManagementCloudwaysResourcesCommunity TutorialsCommunity Q&ACSS-TricksWrite for DOnationsCurrents ResearchHatch Startup ProgramWavemakers ProgramCompass CouncilOpen SourceNewsletter SignupMarketplacePricingPricing CalculatorDocumentationRelease NotesCode of ConductShop SwagSolutionsWebsite HostingVPS HostingWeb & Mobile AppsGame DevelopmentStreamingVPNSaaS PlatformsCloud Hosting for BlockchainStartup ResourcesMigration AssistanceContactSupportSalesReport AbuseSystem StatusShare your ideasCompanyAboutLeadershipBlogCareersCustomersPartnersReferral ProgramAffiliate ProgramPressLegalPrivacy PolicySecurityInvestor RelationsProductsOverviewDropletsKubernetesFunctionsApp PlatformGradientâ¢ AI GPU DropletsGradientâ¢ AI Bare Metal GPUsGradientâ¢ AI 1-Click Models Gradientâ¢ AI PlatformLoad BalancersManaged DatabasesSpacesBlock StorageAPIUptimeIdentity and Access ManagementCloudwaysResourcesCommunity TutorialsCommunity Q&ACSS-TricksWrite for DOnationsCurrents ResearchHatch Startup ProgramWavemakers ProgramCompass CouncilOpen SourceNewsletter SignupMarketplacePricingPricing CalculatorDocumentationRelease NotesCode of ConductShop SwagSolutionsWebsite HostingVPS HostingWeb & Mobile AppsGame DevelopmentStreamingVPNSaaS PlatformsCloud Hosting for BlockchainStartup ResourcesMigration AssistanceContactSupportSalesReport AbuseSystem StatusShare your ideasÂ© 2025 DigitalOcean, LLC.Sitemap.
