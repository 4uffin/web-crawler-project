SSH keys provide a more secure way to log in to your Droplet.
The Droplet Console provides a secure way to connect to your Droplets through one-click SSH access to your Droplets from the terminal.
Cloud Firewalls are a network-based, stateful firewall service for Droplets provided at no additional cost. Cloud firewalls block all traffic that isnât expressly permitted by a rule.
App Platform
Trusted Sources allow you to securely connect your apps and functions to Managed Databases.
Encrypted Environment variables allows you to add secrets as ENV vars for your app that wonât be exposed through the UI.
We help shield Apps from DDoS attacks at our networkâs edge.
App Platform uses Kata Containers, which results in a more secure container runtime with lightweight virtual machines that feel and perform like containers, but help provide stronger workload isolation using hardware virtualization technology as a second layer of defense.
DigitalOcean Kubernetes
Standard Kubernetes network policies and Cilium network policies can be used to limit network traffic to/from workloads in a DOKS cluster.
All traffic to worker nodes from the internet is blocked by default. Ports are automatically opened when NodePort services are created.
Worker nodes are in a userâs VPC. LB<->worker and worker<->worker communication happens over VPC.
Kubernetes Secrets stored in etcd are encrypted at rest using a per-cluster key.
Etcd data is encrypted at rest.
DigitalOcean is on the Kubernetes Private Distributors List and receives advance notification of critical security issues. We release security fixes as soon as possible.
Users can configure their cluster to receive automatic patch version upgrades.
Users can configure SSL termination or passthrough on DOKS-managed load balancers using annotations.
DigitalOcean Functions
Compute and networking resources isolated for each of your functions.
Functions operate over HTTPS and TLS by default.
Encrypted Environment variables allows you to add secrets asn ENV vars for your functions that wonât be exposed through the UI, CLI or API.
We help functions from DDoS attacks at our networkâs edge.
Managed Databases
The platform is managed to perform updates of software which powers customer instances. This includes database engines and related software.
Backups of customer managed database instances are taken and stored off-site. They are encrypted while stored to prevent unauthorized access to customer database data without the required decryption keys.
Managed Database customer instances connection occur over TLS/SSL, which provides encryption of traffic in transit between the customer applications and the customer managed databases.
Managed Databases support customer-controlled users and permissionsâthe user decides which users connect with which privilege to which database.
Managed Databases support an application firewall which allows the user to configure from which sources a connection can be made to the managed database instance.
Spaces
S3 V4 authentication provides identity verification of the requestor and in-transit data protection.
Each customer has one or more unique identity keys and can use Access Control Lists to control access to the data.
Data is encrypted on the disk. If an attacker obtains physical access to the disks they will not be able to access the data.
Customers can provide temporary, secure access to specific data to other users.
HTTPS ensures that the data is encrypted in transit.
Allows customers to set their own encryption keys.
Spaces is secure by default, reducing the likelihood that data is leaked by accident. For example, by default file listing is restricted only to users with keys, and by default static site hosting is disabled.
Volumes
Data is encrypted on the disk.
Users can enable LUKS encryption, which helps ensure data is inaccessible without a user-provided passphrase or key.
Users can use linux file permissions on a Volume in the same way that they can on the primary/root disk system.
Networking
Virtual Private Cloud is a isolated network for cloud resources, giving you more control over how your resources communicate with isolation, reminiscent of what you might achieve running systems on premises.
Users can secure their infrastructure and define what services are visible on your Droplets.
Users can set up SSL passthrough to send encrypted SSL requests directly to the backend Droplet pool via VPC Network. This helps secure traffic between the Load Balancer and the backend droplets. Integration with Letâs Encrypt Certificate.
Users can set up SSL termination, which decrypts SSL requests at the load balancer and sends them unencrypted to the backend via the Dropletsâ private IP addresses. SSL termination places the slower and more CPU-intensive work of decryption on the load balancer and simplifies certificate management. Traffic between the load balancer and its Droplets is secured by routing over the VPC network.
Marketplace
When images are submitted to the Marketplace they go through an automated image check. This helps check for and fix potential security concerns and verifies the image is compatible with the marketplace. The check also helps identify any configuration issues that would need to be fixed by the image vendor before it goes live in the Marketplace for customers.
API
DigitalOcean has partnered with GitHub to join their secret scanning program to protect our joint customers from leaking API tokens in their code. When GitHub detects a DigitalOcean API token committed to a repository, we are alerted. The token is automatically revoked and we notify the customer.
Custom Scopes for API Tokens and Custom Scopes for OAuth Applications are now available. With this feature release, customers can create personal access tokens that secure workflows by granting only the permissions the token needs and restricting access to other resources.
