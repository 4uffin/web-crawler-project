It was really easy to handle everything, I don't have to be a master DevOps engineer who knows everything just to develop one application. We have around 70 App Platforms now, and it has changed the way we deployâwe have only one DevOps engineer for all of our projects.Andres MurciaCTO, PicapRead the full storyDigitalOcean App Platform's price performance was the bestâit was much much cheaper than Heroku and it also abstracted away a layer of complexity that we just didnât need to deal with because weâre such a small team.Marko Å irecLead Backend Engineer at Blub BlubOf all the services I have tried, the one I like the most is the App Platform and how easy it is to configure everything.Joshua C.G2I needed a platform to host my upcoming AI-based app from frontend to middleware to backend with databases, block storage and machine learning. I didn't want all of my technology in different servers, on different platforms, and custom-created to run on a particular infrastructure. As such, DigitalOcean provided me with all of the above and made it next to seamless to integrate with each other.Carlo W.G2Your app platform is awesome, I've just migrated 2 static sites (previously running on a droplet) and it works great. You're the only cloud that helps me save money.
