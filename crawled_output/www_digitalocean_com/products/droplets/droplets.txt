Each Droplet you create is a new server you can use, either standalone or as part of a larger, cloud-based infrastructure.Which Droplet size should I choose?Choosing the right Droplet plan depends on your workload. Please refer to this article that explains the differences between shared and dedicated CPUs, and goes into detail on each Droplet plan.Can I resize my Droplets?Yes. Resizing a Droplet, also known as vertical scaling, increases the amount of resources a Droplet has. There are two resizing options for Droplets:CPU and RAM only. This option lets you increase or decrease the amount of CPU and RAM available to a Droplet.Disk, CPU, and RAM. This option increases the amount of CPU and RAM available to a Droplet and permanently increases the size of a Droplet's disk.Here are some considerations you should take into account before you resize the Droplets.Do you provide SLA for Droplets?DigitalOcean provides a 99.99% uptime SLA for both Droplets and Volumes Block Storage.How much bandwidth do I get with Droplets?Each Droplet includes free outbound data transfer, starting at 500 GiB/month and scaling up to meet your needs. For users with multiple droplets, outbound data transfer is shared between all Droplets each billing cycle. Additional transfer is billed at $0.01 per GiB. Please refer to our Product Docs for more information.What regions are the Droplets in?Basic Droplets are available in all regions. Most other Droplet types are available in all regions. Learn more about regional availability in our Product Docs.What if I use my Droplet for less than a month, will I still be charged for the whole month?You will never be billed more than the monthly cost of your Droplet. All Droplets are billed hourly up to a monthly cap of 672 hours (the number of hours in 4 weeks). If you use your server for fewer than 672 hours during the month, you will be billed for each hour that you used it. If you use your server for more than 672 hours that month, you will be billed at the monthly cost. For example, if you spin up a $10/mo Droplet and use it for 336 hours, then you would be charged $5 (going by the hourly rate). If you use that Droplet for 700 hours, then you would be charged $10 (capped at the monthly rate).Will I be billed if I power off my Droplets?Yes, when you power off your Droplet, you are still billed for it. This is because your disk space, CPU, RAM, and IP address are all reserved, even while powered off. Therefore, charges are made until you destroy the instance.I spun up a $4 Droplet, but my monthly bill is more than $4. Why is that?Our pricing is based on a single Droplet. You may have created additional resources and this could be the reason for the higher bill. You can check your bill in the control panel to get details on the various resources you are using.
