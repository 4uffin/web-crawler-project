Turning backups on for Droplets enables automatic, system-level backups at daily* or weekly intervals, which provide a way to revert to an older state or create new Droplets from a backup.Are backups full, differential, or incremental?Droplet backups are incremental. The first backup of the Droplet after turning backups on is a full backup. Thereafter, every backup is incremental, which makes backups incredibly fast.How are Backups different from snapshots?Backups and snapshots are both disk images of Droplets. Backups are taken automatically daily or weekly and can be retained for seven days or four weeks respectively. Snapshots are taken manually and retained until you choose to delete them. If you want to keep a backup indefinitely, you can convert it to a snapshot.Can I back up data stored in DigitalOcean products other than Droplets?Check out DigitalOcean Volumes to learn more about snapshots for our block storage product. Managed Databases offer free, daily backups of the databases DigitalOcean manages for you. You can also use SnapShooter for a unified, multi-cloud backup management system which combines backups for servers, volumes, files, Kubernetes clusters, files, apps and databases with flexible retention policies.Still have questions?Have a complex setup or additional questions around pricing?
