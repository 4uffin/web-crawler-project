Kafka is great for businesses in data analytics, the Internet of Things, and streaming which often deploy a complex microservice architecture that relies on large amounts of data to move fast between applications. With Kafka, businesses can make more insightful decisions in real-time, increase data producers like sensors, and add data consumers like customersâwithout worrying about scalability, performance issues, and complex architecture.Predictable pricingAlways know what you'll pay with monthly caps and flat pricing across all data centers, all over the world.View all pricingThree-node cluster - Shared vCPUs$148.8Three-node cluster - Dedicated vCPUs$599.25Trusted by businesses worldwideDigitalOcean's Managed Kafka offering has been a game-changer for us at Datacake.
