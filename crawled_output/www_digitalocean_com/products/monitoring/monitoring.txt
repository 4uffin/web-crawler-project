Each Droplet you create is a new server you can use, either standalone or as part of a larger, cloud-based infrastructure.How can I enable Monitoring?Monitoring on DigitalOcean is automatically enabled when you install the Monitoring agent on your Droplet. To install the Monitoring agent, you just need to select Monitoring on your cloud console. You can also use our API, or a package manager to add the agent to your Droplets.Which operating systems does Monitoring support?Ubuntu, CentOS, Debian, and Fedora.What is the retention period of all metrics?The data for the running Droplets is retained for 14 days. When a Droplet is destroyed, the data associated with the Droplet is also deleted.What is the minimum granularity for the data that the Monitoring service receives and aggregates?The minimum granularity supported by Monitoring is 1 minute data points.What thresholds can I set to trigger an alert?When you create an alert policy, you first choose the Droplet metric you want it to monitor. Next, you choose the evaluation period (e.g. five minutes or one hour). To set a threshold, set a target value and choose whether the alert will trigger when the value is above or below the value.How much does Monitoring service cost?Monitoring services are provided at no additional cost.Do more with MonitoringFind out more about Monitoring and creating highly available infrastructure with the help of step-by-step tutorials.AlertingHow to set up monitoring alertsCheck out alertingGetting startedAn introduction to DigitalOcean's Monitoring.Get StartedGlossaryGlossary of DigitalOcean Monitoring terminology and metrics.View termsGet started for freeSign up and get $200 in credit for your first 60 days with DigitalOcean.*Get started*This promotional offer applies to new accounts only.CompanyAboutLeadershipBlogCareersCustomersPartnersReferral ProgramAffiliate ProgramPressLegalPrivacy PolicySecurityInvestor RelationsProductsOverviewDropletsKubernetesFunctionsApp PlatformGradientâ¢ AI GPU DropletsGradientâ¢ AI Bare Metal GPUsGradientâ¢ AI 1-Click Models Gradientâ¢ AI PlatformLoad BalancersManaged DatabasesSpacesBlock StorageAPIUptimeIdentity and Access ManagementCloudwaysResourcesCommunity TutorialsCommunity Q&ACSS-TricksWrite for DOnationsCurrents ResearchHatch Startup ProgramWavemakers ProgramCompass CouncilOpen SourceNewsletter SignupMarketplacePricingPricing CalculatorDocumentationRelease NotesCode of ConductShop SwagSolutionsWebsite HostingVPS HostingWeb & Mobile AppsGame DevelopmentStreamingVPNSaaS PlatformsCloud Hosting for BlockchainStartup ResourcesMigration AssistanceContactSupportSalesReport AbuseSystem StatusShare your ideasCompanyAboutLeadershipBlogCareersCustomersPartnersReferral ProgramAffiliate ProgramPressLegalPrivacy PolicySecurityInvestor RelationsProductsOverviewDropletsKubernetesFunctionsApp PlatformGradientâ¢ AI GPU DropletsGradientâ¢ AI Bare Metal GPUsGradientâ¢ AI 1-Click Models Gradientâ¢ AI PlatformLoad BalancersManaged DatabasesSpacesBlock StorageAPIUptimeIdentity and Access ManagementCloudwaysResourcesCommunity TutorialsCommunity Q&ACSS-TricksWrite for DOnationsCurrents ResearchHatch Startup ProgramWavemakers ProgramCompass CouncilOpen SourceNewsletter SignupMarketplacePricingPricing CalculatorDocumentationRelease NotesCode of ConductShop SwagSolutionsWebsite HostingVPS HostingWeb & Mobile AppsGame DevelopmentStreamingVPNSaaS PlatformsCloud Hosting for BlockchainStartup ResourcesMigration AssistanceContactSupportSalesReport AbuseSystem StatusShare your ideasÂ© 2025 DigitalOcean, LLC.Sitemap.
