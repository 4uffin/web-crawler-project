Get the raw performance you need for high-traffic applications, large datasets, and CI/CD pipelines.Get startedWork fast and scale up with reliable block storageExcellent performanceVolumes Block Storage is designed for demanding business-critical applications requiring high throughput and IOPS. NVMe is the fastest available storage medium that also provides low latency for reading and writing data.Built for 99.99% uptime and resilienceAlways encrypted at rest and when replicated, your data is protected and maintains high durability and availability even if hardware fails. All your Volumes data is transmitted to Droplets over isolated networks, is stored independently of Droplet storage and can be instantly moved across DropletsAdd Volumes Block Storage to Kubernetes clustersEasily write and access persistent data in Kubernetes clusters with Volumes Block Storage by creating a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) as part of your deployment.Built for scalabilityWith affordable pricing and strategic growth in mind, you can always easily scale block storage up or down and move storage between Droplets.Practical use cases for object storageAugment Droplet storageIncrease Droplet storage capacity independently without paying for a larger, more expensive Droplet and keep your data safely on Volumes even if you destroy your Droplet.Machine learning and Big DataUse Volumes to store the input data you need to train artificial intelligence/machine learning models and to store the output of trained models.Distributed web applicationsVolumes Block Storage is persistent and secure, perfect for distributed web applications like blockchain and NFTs that need high performance storage for many distributed web applications such as âProof of Stakeâ nodes.Store filesSave data such as website files, log files, and backups and access them at high speeds to prevent application failures caused by slow storage.Host databasesConfidently host databases that need to quickly serve the demands of high-traffic applications and services.Backup and duplicate your dataVolumes Snapshots create on-demand disk backups of your Volumes, so you can further protect data and quickly create new volumes with those backups to share across multiple Droplets.Programmatically control Volumes Block StorageOur API enables you to deploy and manage your Volumes Block Storage simply and programmatically.RubyCurlGoDoctlvolume = DropletKit::Volume.new(

Take any number of requests and actionsâincluding creating Volumes, attaching, detaching, and retrieving Volume informationâwith curl commands or the official Ruby and Go API wrappers, all including OAuth support.Explore API DocsGenerally speaking, cost-wise, I estimate we're saving at least a third, to maybe a half, as if we were to go with another cloud provider.Alykhan JethaCEO of MarketcircleLearn more about MarketcircleEverything with DigitalOcean is well documented and logical. My experience with AWS wasn't as great because it's over-complicated with lots of documentation.
