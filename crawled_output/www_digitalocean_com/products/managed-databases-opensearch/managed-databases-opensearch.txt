For our particular use case, this was a huge advantage as it allowed us to keep our OpenSearch-compatible workloads close to the majority of our services, massively reducing latency while also improving security across our platform. As with all Managed Database services DigitalOcean provides, it reduces our exposure and risk in running complex distributed services. Having been long-term consumers of Managed MySQL and Managed Redis, we feel extremely confident in DigitalOcean's ability to provide rock-solid managed services for complex data storage solutions.Mike GoodfellowCo-founder & CTO, RepostExchangeWe use DigitalOcean Managed OpenSearch for putting all our logs together in one place. This combined with the ability to automatically forward all DigitalOcean Managed database logs, is really brilliant and helps us a lot to identify issues or slow DB queries - our database is currently processing 20k operations/sec peak, so having great insights into logs is crucial for us.Lukas BÃ¶hlerCEO & Co-Founder, Gleap12Predictable pricing Always know what you'll pay with monthly caps and flat pricing across all data centers, all over the world.
