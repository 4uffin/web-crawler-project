VPC gives you more control over how your resources communicate, with isolation reminiscent of what you might achieve running systems on premises.SimpleEasily create multiple VPCs through our developer-friendly dashboard, CLI, and API. We automatically create VPCs for your resources when you don't want to customize network settings.CustomizableConfigure your VPC to meet your precise requirements. Specify an IP address range to interconnect another network or configure Firewalls to control traffic in and out.ExtendableDigitalOceanâs VPC Peering helps to enable secure, private communication between VPCs within your account, across different regions or within the same region. Connect resources like Droplets, DBaaS, and DOKS clusters as if theyâre on the same network, with up to 50 peering connections per account (depending on account type).Partner Network Connect is now generally available for all customersSeamlessly connect your multi-cloud and hybrid environments with high-speed, private connectivityâno VPNs, no public internet exposure.Learn moreThe price DigitalOcean came back with was literally 20 to 30% cheaper than what we had been paying at AWS. That gave us a lot of motivation to explore who DigitalOcean is and what services they could provide for us.Shawn PetersenCIO at NoBidLearn moreThe prerequisite for any cloud provider is availability. If your platform isn't reliable and functioning at peak performance, it doesn't matter if your support is great or your prices are low. I'm confident in DigitalOcean's infrastructure, service level, and scale, and I'm willing to vouch for that.DevOps ManagerOriginLearn more12Create a VPC network in secondsCreating a VPC network takes just a few second.
