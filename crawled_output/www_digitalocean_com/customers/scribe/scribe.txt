contentsScribe is on a mission to âuplevel how people do work.â Their Workflow AI platform was created to solve the problem of sharing know-how thatâs trapped in peopleâs heads with other team members. Documentation is usually so painful to create that most teams simply donât do it. Without it, however, colleagues are blocked, Scribe helps organizations document and scale how work gets done, turning processes into playbooks to train colleagues, assist customers, and drive software adoption.
âWe make it effortless for people to capture their work while theyâre doing their work and automatically turn any workflow into a beautiful, self-updating step-by-step guide,â said Mouad Hadji, Head of AI at Scribe. Today, the company serves 4 million users across 600,000 businesses, including 94% of Fortune 500 companies.
As Scribeâs AI team matured, so did their infrastructure needsâparticularly around performance, compliance, and cost. âWe were looking to strengthen our security and compliance requirements while maintaining access to the best hardware,â explained Mouad. âFlexibility was also critical, because weâre growing fast and we need to move quickly.â

Finding the right cloud provider
After evaluating multiple cloud providers, Scribe selected DigitalOcean Gradient GPUs for its unique ability to deliver enterprise-grade GPU infrastructure at a competitive priceâwithout compromising on flexibility or support.
âWe evaluated others,â Mouad said, âbut the lack of flexibility in their offerings and the price points were very dissuasive. For fast-moving ML teams, paying a higher price means less experimentation, less performance.â
Scribeâs AI workloads are powered primarily by two DigitalOcean offerings:
H100 GPUs: Used for everything from small single-GPU experiments to large multi-node, multi-week model trainings.
Encrypted Volume Storage: Ensures that all data remains secure and compliant with enterprise standards.
âWe go from using a single H100 for a small experiment to a node of 8 H100s for multi-day experiments, to multi-node training for multi-week workloads,â Mouad shared. âSo we go from small to large.â This flexibility was key in enabling the team to scale experimentation and accelerate innovation.
A partnership that supports speed and scale
Beyond the infrastructure, Scribe highlighted the quality of support as a differentiator. âWe have a direct Slack channel with the technical team,â Mouad noted. âEvery time we have a question, we get a responsive team behind the scenes. That kind of partner closeness gives us confidence things will run smoothly.â
Mouad also emphasized the advantage of DigitalOceanâs tailored customer experience: âIt feels like DigitalOcean is the right-sized partner for a fast-growing company like us,â he said. âThe team is committed to being close to their customers and offering the right-sized solutions.â
Working with DigitalOcean has enabled Scribe to:
Reduce infrastructure costs with competitive GPU pricing.
Expand R&D capacity by freeing up budget for more experimentation.
Accelerate hiring by scaling infrastructure alongside a fast-growing engineering team.
Maintain enterprise-grade security and compliance.
Whatâs Next for Scribe
As Scribe continues its mission to uplevel how work gets done, AI remains core to its future. âWeâre transforming raw expertise into easy-to-follow, interactive step-by-step guides,â said Mouad. âAI plays a foundational role in this mission. As we build a generational company, we know weâll need partners like DigitalOcean to help us offer unique capabilities that continue to accelerate the pace at which we deliver value to customers.â
