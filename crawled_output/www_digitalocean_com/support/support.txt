Reserved IPs
Can I use my Droplet's IP as a Reserved IP?
You cannot convert a Droplet IP address into a Reserved IP.
Can I preserve my Droplet's IPv4 address when I transfer the Droplet?
You cannot retain a Droplet’s IPv4 when you transfer the Droplet to a new region. Use a reserved IP address to maintain a static IP address.
Can I choose my Droplet's IP address?
You cannot create Droplets with a specific IP address, but you can use reserved IPs for a static address that you can migrate between Droplets.
How do I get a Droplet's dedicated IP address?
Droplets do not have a dedicated IP address, but you can create a Reserved IP, which is a reassignable static IP address.
SnapShooter
I got a Permission Denied error when running a SnapShooter backup.
Either remount the tmp folder with exec permissions or set the backup engine to use the home directory instead.
Snapshots
Can I restore individual files or directories from a snapshot or a backup?
The only way to restore files from an image is to recreate a Droplet or volume from the image and copy the flies from there.
Why can't I create a Droplet from a snapshot?
You cannot create Droplets in certain datacenters due to limited capacity. If you have snapshots in a limited capacity datacenter, transfer them to another datacenter to create Droplets from them.
Can I downsize a Droplet using a snapshot?
You cannot downsize a Droplet from a snapshot. Data is not always stored sequentially in memory, so reducing the size of a disk can result in data loss or corruption.
Why is my snapshot's size different from reported disk usage?
Snapshots of Droplets are a best estimate based on the disk usage. Snapshots of volumes operate at the block storage level, so the snapshot size may not match what the filesystem reports.
How do I fix a "The resource you were accessing could not be found" error when restoring a Droplet from a snapshot?
This error happens when the Droplet you’re trying to restore no longer exists, so try creating a new Droplet from the snapshot instead.
Do snapshots retain the IP address of the Droplet they were created from?
No, but you can use reserved IPs to assign the same address to new or redeployed Droplets.
Can I download a backup or snapshot?
You cannot currently download DigitalOcean backups or snapshots, but you can use third-party tools to save your data locally.
How long will my backup or snapshot take to complete?
Creating a backup or snapshot takes roughly 2 minutes per GB of used space.
Spaces
How do I back up Spaces buckets?
Create another bucket to transfer data to, save your files locally, or use an automatic backup tool.
Teams
Do paid DigitalOcean support plans support multiple teams?
No, each team needs their own plan.
How do I transfer a domain between teams?
We do not support directly transferring domain ownership from one team to another. Instead, you can download a zone file with all of the domain’s DNS information.
Why is my account now a team?
Team collaboration is built into the DigitalOcean experience from sign-up.
How do I transfer a Droplet to someone else?
You can transfer snapshots of Droplets to others by email address or by team.
Third-Party Applications
How can I renew Let's Encrypt certificates?
You can renew your certificate manually using Certbot.
Can I install cPanel or WHM on my Droplet?
You can install cPanel and WHM on AlmaLinux, Rocky, and Ubuntu Droplets.
Can I use Windows on a Droplet?
No, we do not provide Windows images for Droplets or support Windows custom images.
Can I have more than one WordPress instance installed?
Yes, you can serve multiple WordPress instances from a single Droplet.
Volumes
Can I attach a volume to multiple Droplets?
No, but you can mount a remote filesystem on a Droplet with the volume attached using software like SSHFS or NFS.
Why does my Droplet show almost 100% disk usage even after attaching a new volume?
Adding a volume to your Droplet doesn’t increase its main disk size. You need to resize the Droplet to increase its main disk size.
Why is my resized volume smaller than I expected?
Filesystem tools often don’t report the capacity reserved for metadata and the root user, and some report size in different units.
VPC
Can I add an old Droplet to a VPC without changing its IP address?
Older Droplets that did not have VPC enabled prior to October 2020 cannot be added to a VPC network without changing its IP address.
