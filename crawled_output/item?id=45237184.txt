I wonder if they're confusing the cause and effect.Do people who live above 8k feet not die of heart disease or do people with heart disease find it too difficult to live above 8k feet so only people without heart disease live above 8k feet?I live at 7200 feet and I know several people who have moved to lower altitudes because it's "too hard to breath" here.replybix6 11 minutes ago

> The best defense is to start at 5,000 feet and stay there for 3 days, drinking water like crazy and resting. Then, come up to the higher elevation and give yourself a day or two to adjust. That usually works.This is crazy to me as I usually only get 1 acclimation night in before going up. I’m curious how people can find their limits / needs?replytonkinai 10 minutes ago

"Living at high altitude reduces risk of dying from heart disease", but you're litereally locked in your house because the sun takes every chance to fry you. I'm okay with not reducing my risk of dying from heart disease.replykaonwarb 11 minutes ago

As a child I lived for two years at ~11k ft (La Paz, Bolivia). I can vouch for the impact of both Acute Mountain Sickness and the sun at that elevation.replyrc_kas 44 minutes ago
