Wow, @Ghost is killing it today with their newsletter. It may just be me, but it seems like more time and care is being spent every week on it. If you can show me a link about my obsession I didn’t know about yet — that’s something.

Ok, the Ghost newsletter is hands down the best newsletter in my inbox and it is not even close. There's not a single other one that I am going back to read or look forward to getting. Excellent job!
