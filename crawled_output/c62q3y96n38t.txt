So pedestrian from Man Utd. Playing slow, sloppy passes in the middle of the park. Erling Haaland being left on his own as the furthest player forward - that just can't happen. Organisation in possession was awful from Manchester United.

This is the 12th time that both Phil Foden and Erling Haaland have scored in the same Premier League game for Manchester City. Since 2022-23, only Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa (18 for Brentford) and Cody Gakpo and Mohamed Salah (14 for Liverpool) have scored in the same match for a side more often in the competition.

A great strike, left foot volley curling in. A really good fingertip down to Gianluigi Donnarumma's right-hand-side. Donnarumma looks very secure at the back.

Image source, ReutersManchester United's officials have been stressing the aim this season is to qualify for Europe. When Senne Lammens arrived, they said the attraction was he would be at his peak in three years when United hope to be trying to win the major prizes.By definition, that means they are not at that point yet - and the evidence is on show today.They have played well in patches. But City are a different class.On Friday, Pep Guardiola said he wouldn't swap Erling Haaland for anyone. That goal is why. United have no-one at that level.

They are looking for consecutive wins at the Etihad for the first time since March 2021.Since 2015-16, the home team has ended on the winning side in just six out of 20 Premier League meetings in the Manchester derby (D4 L10). Indeed, since then, the only Premier League fixture to see more away wins (10) is Crystal Palace vs Liverpool (12).Manchester City have lost two of their first three Premier League matches for the first time since the 2004-05 campaign (W1), while it is the fewest points (3) ever collected by Pep Guardiola in his first three league games of a season. The last time City lost three of their first four games was in 1995-96, a season they were eventually relegated.Manchester United registered their eighth win in 30 Premier League matches under RÃºben Amorim (D7 L15) thanks to their 3-2 win over newly promoted Burnley on MD3. Half of Amorimâs wins have been against promoted sides, with the Portuguese manager holding just a 16% win ratio against sides not promoted to the division that campaign (4 wins in 25).Manchester United have had 58 shots in the Premier League this season, 14 more than any other side. Itâs their most shots in the first three games of a season since 2017-18 (60).Pep Guardiola has lost 49 of his 345 Premier League matches (W247 D49), with 22% of those coming since the start of last November (11). A defeat in this game would see him take the second largest number of games to lose 50, behind Sir Alex Ferguson, whose 50th defeat wasnât until his 367th match.Manchester United have made the most off-ball runs in behind their opponentâs defensive line in the Premier League this season (131), with forward Bryan Mbeumo responsible for 54 of those â the most of any player. Three of the five most in-behind runs by a player in a match so far in 2025-26 have been Mbeumo, with a high of 22 against Burnley last time out.Man Utd captain Bruno Fernandes has created the most chances in the Premier League this season so far both overall (12) and in open play (8). Fernandes has also scored in each of Unitedâs last three wins against Man City in the competition (March 2021, January 2023, December 2024).Both Man Cityâs Gianluigi Donnarumma and Man Utdâs Senne Lammens could make their Premier League debuts in this game. Excluding MD1 games, in only two Premier League games have both clubs given a debut to goalkeepers: Nottingham Forest (Andy Marriott) vs Spurs (Kevin Dearden) in April 1993 and Charlton Athletic (Darren Randolph) vs Liverpool (Daniele Padelli) in May 2007.HomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCBBC emails for youAdvertise with usCopyright Â© 2025 BBC.
