Manchester United once again, how many defensive players on the pitch? The formation is not working and they're terrible. I believe right now if Forest Green Rovers got to the third round of the FA Cup I would want to draw them at home. Grimsby beat them...I have never said a manager should leave their position. I am a manager and at the minute I am a very, very good one.

Image source, Getty ImagesWhen Foden's standards dropped he was not in the team. Somebody like Cole Palmer, when his standards drop is in the team [at Chelsea] so can play his way back into form.I think he needed that moment [the goal]. He can always get into positions and he wants to get on the end of it. How many times do you see midfielders get the timing of their runs wrong?

There were elements of the game which were working for United. They had a foot of the game, however Man City were clinical in certain moments. But my problem with this system is you're asking players to play in positions they're not used to. And I'd rather have Bruno Fernandes higher up the field. I'd like to have two solid centre backs, and a 4-3-3 is what I believe but we know he doesn't do that. I'm never a fan of changing centre backs, personnel and he tends to do that, it's the same patterns. When you overthink things, he's had a period in the international break where he said he did everything, whereas Pep was the complete opposite. He was out there having a great day and forgot about football. Amorim needs to not do too much sometimes because it can eat into you. It can eat into your personal life. He's really intense and focused on his style and it's all about him. I think he needs to try and relax a little bit. I think the players sense that a little bit and are playing within themselves.

Me as an old number nine I expect more from a number nine playing for United. Josko Gvardiol and Ruben Dias looked like they were on a park playing against Sesko today.

It is all plusses for City. They scored three, they could have scored more. It is like they have had a reset. The international break came at a good time for them. There is definitely a different feel to them today. It was an important win and an important statement.

suffering right now. The lads gave everything. It wasn't a pretty match but it was all for him."On scoring and reacting to outside talk: "There has been a lot of talk. It's impossible [not to hear outside talk]. Everything has been quite negative but that's the world that we live in when you are playing at the highest level. "When you come off winning the player of the season award the standards are higher and I understand that. It's about reading those comments, reacting as well as possible and getting back to my level."On Erling Haaland: "A complete performance, the way he held up the ball when we were struggling. He did everything. Defending, attacking, running in behind and doing the dirty work. It was a full shift and we need that more."

Erling Haaland has started the season in fine goal-scoring form.The 25-year-old has scored 11 goals in six appearances for club and country - including seven in his previous two games.His only blank was against Spurs on 23 August.

both scored hat-tricks in a 6-3 victory here in October 2022 and they did the damage for the hosts once more.Foden's header past the reach of Bayindir in the first half was his seventh goal in a Manchester derby, with the Englishman having only netted more frequently in his career against Brighton with eight.Haaland came into the fixture on the back of scoring an astonishing five goals for his country in the 11-1 thrashing of Moldova during the week but was being made to do his defensive duties for large periods early on.When he got to show of his attacking talent, the two goals he scored were coolly finished to take his tally to five in just four league games this season and 90 in 101 Premier League matches.He should have had more but hit the woodwork from a couple of yards out, while a flicked effort was collected by Bayindir.United were falling apart and City were threatening to rack up another sizeable scoreline against their opponents â Tijjani Reijnders clipping wide after running through having also had a side-footed effort that was kept out by Bayindir in the first half.Guardiola will be smiling tonight after a satisfactory afternoon, but the same cannot be said for counterpart Ruben Amorim, who will face serious scrutiny once again.Man Utd analysis: Is Amorim the right man to solve the problems?BySimon StoneChief football news reporterIn the match build-up , Amorim was asked who had the bigger issues to resolve - him or Guardiola.Amorim was incredulous."To compare me with the situation of Guardiola? Is just a joke. I think we have bigger problems," he said.Amorim's side, who went into the derby ahead of their rivals in the table for the first time since 2020, did well for long periods. Yet it was City who secured a deserved and very comfortable 3-0 win because, when it really mattered, they were a different class to their visitors.They had a couple of opportunities to really threaten the home goal in the first half. Unfortunately, on the first occasion, Amad Diallo's pass to Bryan Mbeumo was overhit and too wide. On the second Benjamin Sesko played Mbeumo into trouble when a better execution would have sent the Cameroon forward clear.On his first Premier League start, Sesko had one opportunity when he was sent running at the City goal, only for the Slovenian to take a heavy first touch and chip his shot into Gianluigi Donnarumma, who had closed the gap right down.Presented with a similar situation in the second half, Haaland forced his way past Matthijs de Ligt and Luke Shaw and then calmly chipped over an advancing Altay Bayindir.Amorim was right. He has much bigger problems than Guardiola. That is the easy bit. The big question is how can he solve them?What next for these two sides?Manchester City: Guardiola's side begin their Champions League campaign by hosting Serie A champions Napoli on Thursday (20:00 BST kick-off).Manchester United: With no European football this season, Amorim's men host unbeaten Chelsea next Saturday (17:30 BST).Have your say on Man City's performanceWhat did you make of Man Utdâs display?The Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.

RightManchester City have won five of their last eight Premier League matches against Manchester United (D1 L2), though they failed to win either game (D1 L1) last season for the first time since 2020-21.Manchester United have inflicted 25% of Pep Guardiolaâs total home Premier League defeats as Man City manager, with the Red Devils winning four times there against the Spaniard (4/16). They are looking for consecutive wins at the Etihad for the first time since March 2021.Since 2015-16, the home team has ended on the winning side in just six out of 20 Premier League meetings in the Manchester derby (D4 L10). Indeed, since then, the only Premier League fixture to see more away wins (10) is Crystal Palace vs Liverpool (12).Manchester City have lost two of their first three Premier League matches for the first time since the 2004-05 campaign (W1), while it is the fewest points (3) ever collected by Pep Guardiola in his first three league games of a season. The last time City lost three of their first four games was in 1995-96, a season they were eventually relegated.Manchester United registered their eighth win in 30 Premier League matches under RÃºben Amorim (D7 L15) thanks to their 3-2 win over newly promoted Burnley on MD3. Half of Amorimâs wins have been against promoted sides, with the Portuguese manager holding just a 16% win ratio against sides not promoted to the division that campaign (4 wins in 25).Manchester United have had 58 shots in the Premier League this season, 14 more than any other side. Itâs their most shots in the first three games of a season since 2017-18 (60).Pep Guardiola has lost 49 of his 345 Premier League matches (W247 D49), with 22% of those coming since the start of last November (11). A defeat in this game would see him take the second largest number of games to lose 50, behind Sir Alex Ferguson, whose 50th defeat wasnât until his 367th match.Manchester United have made the most off-ball runs in behind their opponentâs defensive line in the Premier League this season (131), with forward Bryan Mbeumo responsible for 54 of those â the most of any player. Three of the five most in-behind runs by a player in a match so far in 2025-26 have been Mbeumo, with a high of 22 against Burnley last time out.Man Utd captain Bruno Fernandes has created the most chances in the Premier League this season so far both overall (12) and in open play (8). Fernandes has also scored in each of Unitedâs last three wins against Man City in the competition (March 2021, January 2023, December 2024).Both Man Cityâs Gianluigi Donnarumma and Man Utdâs Senne Lammens could make their Premier League debuts in this game. Excluding MD1 games, in only two Premier League games have both clubs given a debut to goalkeepers: Nottingham Forest (Andy Marriott) vs Spurs (Kevin Dearden) in April 1993 and Charlton Athletic (Darren Randolph) vs Liverpool (Daniele Padelli) in May 2007.HomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCBBC emails for youAdvertise with usCopyright Â© 2025 BBC.
