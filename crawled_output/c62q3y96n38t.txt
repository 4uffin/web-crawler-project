Still failing to see how Man Utd have improved really. New players yes. Same old disconnected messy play. Is there any excuses left?CeironSame old United. No one is even surprised anymore.

Since his Premier League debut for Manchester City in September 2023, no player has more assists from open play for the club in the competition than Jeremy Doku (14).

United are 12th as things stand, which would be an improvement on last year at least...

The pass was far too slow. Bryan Mbuemo has got to be two yards off, but he should know better.

Bryan Mbeumo is saved by the flag in a way. He runs onto a long ball over the top and skies his shot from 16 yards. High and wide. So probably for the best it emerged he was offside.

Image source, Getty ImagesUnited had started well and their shape was good. They have won the ball back well and had good numbers around the ball for the City goal as well, but they have not had a great few minutes since the goal.Their problem is always going to be Ugarte and Fernandes have three City midfielders to pick up, and they need help. We just saw Yoro come across to the middle, and that's the kind of thing that needs to happen more when City have possession.You can hear more from Murphy on MOTD at 22:30 BST on BBC One and the BBC Sport website and app.

City the much better team here. They could do with scoring a second while they're on top.

Only Sergio Aguero and BBC Sport ace Wayne Rooney (both 8) have more goals in the Manchester derby in the Premier League than Phil Foden (7).

United hanging on a bit here. Erling Haaland plays the ball out right to Bernardo Silva and runs into the box to get the return ball but the Portuguese overhits it slightly and Haaland can't control/shoot.

Almost a second, and another assist for Jeremy Doku. The Belgian picks out Tijjani Reijnders, whose first-time side-footed effort is straight at the United keeper.

Doesn't feel like the game has calmed down it is very frantic. A few little triangles played in the corners, but they're being broken down by the defenses.

I never like seeing a team go back to their goalkeeper within about 10 seconds of taking a corner but that's what City do here.

Image source, Getty ImagesThat is absolutely atrocious defending from Man Utd. Half a dozen players watching Foden head it inBenFoden ran off Bruno Fernandes to find himself in acres of space for an absolute age before the ball was crossed to him. Yet ANOTHER game where Bruno playing as one half of a midfield duo has cost Man Utd a goal. He CANNOT play there. Zero discipline when it comes to tracking his man.Nick the Gooner

They are looking for consecutive wins at the Etihad for the first time since March 2021.Since 2015-16, the home team has ended on the winning side in just six out of 20 Premier League meetings in the Manchester derby (D4 L10). Indeed, since then, the only Premier League fixture to see more away wins (10) is Crystal Palace vs Liverpool (12).Manchester City have lost two of their first three Premier League matches for the first time since the 2004-05 campaign (W1), while it is the fewest points (3) ever collected by Pep Guardiola in his first three league games of a season. The last time City lost three of their first four games was in 1995-96, a season they were eventually relegated.Manchester United registered their eighth win in 30 Premier League matches under RÃºben Amorim (D7 L15) thanks to their 3-2 win over newly promoted Burnley on MD3. Half of Amorimâs wins have been against promoted sides, with the Portuguese manager holding just a 16% win ratio against sides not promoted to the division that campaign (4 wins in 25).Manchester United have had 58 shots in the Premier League this season, 14 more than any other side. Itâs their most shots in the first three games of a season since 2017-18 (60).Pep Guardiola has lost 49 of his 345 Premier League matches (W247 D49), with 22% of those coming since the start of last November (11). A defeat in this game would see him take the second largest number of games to lose 50, behind Sir Alex Ferguson, whose 50th defeat wasnât until his 367th match.Manchester United have made the most off-ball runs in behind their opponentâs defensive line in the Premier League this season (131), with forward Bryan Mbeumo responsible for 54 of those â the most of any player. Three of the five most in-behind runs by a player in a match so far in 2025-26 have been Mbeumo, with a high of 22 against Burnley last time out.Man Utd captain Bruno Fernandes has created the most chances in the Premier League this season so far both overall (12) and in open play (8). Fernandes has also scored in each of Unitedâs last three wins against Man City in the competition (March 2021, January 2023, December 2024).Both Man Cityâs Gianluigi Donnarumma and Man Utdâs Senne Lammens could make their Premier League debuts in this game. Excluding MD1 games, in only two Premier League games have both clubs given a debut to goalkeepers: Nottingham Forest (Andy Marriott) vs Spurs (Kevin Dearden) in April 1993 and Charlton Athletic (Darren Randolph) vs Liverpool (Daniele Padelli) in May 2007.HomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCBBC emails for youAdvertise with usCopyright Â© 2025 BBC.
