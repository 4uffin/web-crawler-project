I have been using SVGs for charts on my blog for a couple of months[0] now. Using SVGs satisfied me, but in all honesty, I don't think anyone else cares. For completeness the benefits are below:* The charts are never blurry* The text in the chart is selectable and searchable* The file size could be small compared to PNGs* The charts can use a font set by a stylesheet* The charts can have a builtin dark mode (not demonstrated on my blog)Additionally as the OP shown, the text in SVG is indexed by google, but comes up in the image sections [1].The downside was hours of fiddling with system fonts and webfonts and font settings in matplotlib. Also the sizing of the text in the chart and how it is displayed in your page is tightly coupled and requires some forethought.[0] https://aleyan.com/blog/2025-llm-assistant-census[1] https://www.google.com/search?q=%22slabiciunea+lui+Nicu+fore...replycainxinth 28 minutes ago

That's the kind of thing you do not for the users but because of your own standards, and even if no one else appreciates it, you always do.replyTheodores 6 minutes ago

To complete the test, the website needs an HTML page that is mostly SVG. I think that might stand a chance of getting into the main search results rather than just the image search.Also of interest for me would be whether SVG description markup gets picked up in the index.To complete the search of possibilities, having the SVG generated by Javascript on page load would be of interest, for example, with some JSON object of data that then gets parsed to plot some SVG images.Your SVG graphs are very neat and nobody caring is a feature not a bug. If they were blurry PNGs then people might notice but nobody notices 'perfection', just defects.I noticed you were using 'NASA numbers' in your SVGs. Six decimal places for each point on a path is a level of precision that you can cut down with SVGOMG or using the export features from Inkscape. I like to go for integers when possible in SVG.The thing with SVG is that the levels of optimisation go on forever. For example, I would set the viewbox coordinates so that (0, 0) is where the graph starts. Nobody would ever notice or care about that, but it would be something I would have to do.replyDamnInteresting 5 minutes ago

A few years back I updated my site[1] so all of the UI graphics (e.g., logos, icons in the menus) are SVG sprites baked into the HTML. It resulted in a lot fewer requests per page, lower overall page size, and sharp navigation on any device at any resolution. It works great, though it was a lot of initial work to get it working.[1] https://www.damninteresting.comreplyyomismoaqui 1 hour ago

Apart from using SVG the design of that page has that vintage 2000s feel... don't know why but I love itreplyJadeNB 1 hour ago

The reference to Firefox 3.0 probably helps with the vintage feel.replycf100clunk 1 hour ago

Wow, I didn't know SVG was capable of that, the website looks like a HTML/CSS site from the 2000s, but it's still cool.replyOneDeuxTriSeiGo 44 minutes ago

Yeah this is a big part of the reason SVGs are dangerous if treated like normal image files. They are basically equivalent to HTML w/ embedded CSS and can even execute javascript.If you aren't careful they can be used for XSS and all kinds of nasty stuff.They are also super useful in general though despite that.replyTelemakhos 9 minutes ago

There were some tools that let you do a lot of flash-type things using html5 and svg. I used Tumult Hype for an animation project a few years ago, but I don't think it ever became as popular as Flash.replypanny 43 minutes ago

Svgs are capable of anything. You can draw anything with it as it’s just a format for vector graphics. The vectors can be manipulated so you can even make a 3D game engine from it if you wanted.The only thing that separates it from html and css is that html and css biases towards website styled stuff. HTML is designed for text boxes and that kind of stuff while svgs bias more towards a neutral drawing medium: shapes and vectors.So because it’s more neutral you can even make a html engine from svg if you so wanted.replyaaviator42 1 hour ago

Text selection is a little unintuitive (iOS on iPhone) If I’m not directly over the text I get a little magnified bubble instead. On plain HTML text selection is a little more forgiving if your long presses are not accurate.replyp0w3n3d 12 minutes ago

Text selection is sluggish and wonky in Firefox.
A bit flickery in Chrome and Safari, but otherwise behaves fine.replyjasonjmcghee 42 minutes ago

My experience in a chromium-based browser was multiline text selection was not good.Any time you drag over space between lines, it selects something else.replychuckadams 9 minutes ago
| root | parent | next [–]
I think that's just the standard behavior of the selection algorithm with that particular layout.
FF might be applying some kind of debouncing or hysteresis to keep it from flickering, but if so it's making all selection sluggish.replydylan604 31 minutes ago

I did wonder why they didn't just switch out actionscript for js and use plain html/svg/canvas. I'm kind of glad they didn't but I think there would have been money in doing so.replyPaulHoule 46 minutes ago

Actually they did, Adobe still makes the Flash authoring tool but they call it Animate, it exports files that work with an HTML/JS player that does almost everything Flash did.replypapichulo2023 53 minutes ago

The page is old enough that it wouldn’t surprise me if Google and Bing used to index it and are capable of indexing it, but no longer do. A lot of older stuff where you know exactly what’s there just can’t be found any more.https://www.google.com/search?q=svg.nicubunu.ro seems to surface it, with text; https://www.google.com/search?q=site:svg.nicubunu.ro gets the title, but no more text. I’m curious how it decided what the title was. I wonder if they have some kind of “choose the largest text” heuristic if a title is missing.https://duckduckgo.com/?q=svg.nicubunu.ro and https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site:svg.nicubunu.ro don’t show a result.replylblume 26 minutes ago

I have used an LLM to write code in web servers to generate data plots using SVG embedded directly in web pages. This bypasses the need for PNG generation, Javascript for rendering a plot, and also the need for a plotting library. You can see two examples in the gist d29164051477ce1b2b95b788297a1932.reply
