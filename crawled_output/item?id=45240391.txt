I have been using SVGs for charts on my blog for a couple of months[0] now. Using SVGs satisfied me, but in all honesty, I don't think anyone else cares. For completeness the benefits are below:* The charts are never blurry* The text in the chart is selectable and searchable* The file size could be small compared to PNGs* The charts can use a font set by a stylesheet* The charts can have a builtin dark mode (not demonstrated on my blog)Additionally as the OP shown, the text in SVG is indexed by google, but comes up in the image sections [1].The downside was hours of fiddling with system fonts and webfonts and font settings in matplotlib. Also the sizing of the text in the chart and how it is displayed in your page is tightly coupled and requires some forethought.[0] https://aleyan.com/blog/2025-llm-assistant-census[1] https://www.google.com/search?q=%22slabiciunea+lui+Nicu+fore...replycainxinth 4 hours ago

That's the kind of thing you do not for the users but because of your own standards, and even if no one else appreciates it, you always do.replymk12 2 hours ago

Another thing to watch out for with SVGs is how they appear in RSS readers or browser reader views. If you're using external SVG files then it should be fine. If you've optimized them by embedding into the HTML, then you need to be careful. If they rely on CSS rules in the page's CSS then it's not going to work well. For my website I try to make the SVGs self-sufficient by setting the viewBox, width, and height attributes, using a web safe font, and only relying on internal styles. You can still get some measure of light/dark mode support by setting fill or stroke to currentColor.replycoder543 18 minutes ago

What are you using to produce the graphs?I wrote a small graphing library for mine [1], but it has limitations.[1] https://coffeespace.org.uk/projects/sound-source-delta.htmlreplyTheodores 4 hours ago

To complete the test, the website needs an HTML page that is mostly SVG. I think that might stand a chance of getting into the main search results rather than just the image search.Also of interest for me would be whether SVG description markup gets picked up in the index.To complete the search of possibilities, having the SVG generated by Javascript on page load would be of interest, for example, with some JSON object of data that then gets parsed to plot some SVG images.Your SVG graphs are very neat and nobody caring is a feature not a bug. If they were blurry PNGs then people might notice but nobody notices 'perfection', just defects.I noticed you were using 'NASA numbers' in your SVGs. Six decimal places for each point on a path is a level of precision that you can cut down with SVGOMG or using the export features from Inkscape. I like to go for integers when possible in SVG.The thing with SVG is that the levels of optimisation go on forever. For example, I would set the viewbox coordinates so that (0, 0) is where the graph starts. Nobody would ever notice or care about that, but it would be something I would have to do.replyaleyan 3 hours ago

Oh man, this is a deep mine to dig. I haven't even thought about svg size optimization. The default blog template I used really wants me to use hero images, and the jpgs are already hefty. I just looked at my network panel, and it seems the font files are loaded once per svg on initial load and then are cached.What is the motivation for viewbox coordinates being at (0,0)? I have been thinking about setting chart gutters so that the graph is left aligned with the text, but this seems like an orthogonal issue.replyAndrewSwift 1 hour ago

A few years back I updated my site[1] so all of the UI graphics (e.g., logos, icons in the menus) are SVG sprites baked into the HTML. It resulted in a lot fewer requests per page, lower overall page size, and sharp navigation on any device at any resolution. It works great, though it was a lot of initial work to get it working.[1] https://www.damninteresting.comreplye1gen-v 2 hours ago

Just serving a whole SVG file directly never even crossed my mind as an option, very cool.A while back I used a giant interactive SVG as the UI for a site I was prototyping, albeit wrapped in a normal HTML page.
It was easy to set up and worked reasonably well, but I found that in Firefox performance started to degrade beyond a few thousand elements and so converted everything (except some accessibility features) to use a canvas instead.

Has anyone ever built a document editor with SVG?I realize it's far from a best practice and even explicitly stated as a bad idea somewhere in the SVG spec, but the idea of a document editor where you can individually position each and every character and make detailed, individual glyphs natively without loading fonts is interesting to me.Are there any examples of this? Or perhaps different (better) approaches to a document editor with the advantages I said above?replyyomismoaqui 5 hours ago

SVGs are under explored in generative AI. They are effectively a graphics language of their own. LLMs can write them directly without a vision architecture, and understand them in ways that non-vector graphics cannot.replywhyandgrowth 5 hours ago

Yeah this is a big part of the reason SVGs are dangerous if treated like normal image files.

Svgs are capable of anything. You can draw anything with it as it’s just a format for vector graphics. The vectors can be manipulated so you can even make a 3D game engine from it if you wanted.The only thing that separates it from html and css is that html and css biases towards website styled stuff. HTML is designed for text boxes and that kind of stuff while svgs bias more towards a neutral drawing medium: shapes and vectors.So because it’s more neutral you can even make a html engine from svg if you so wanted.replyyoussefabdelm 3 hours ago

Text selection is sluggish and wonky in Firefox.
A bit flickery in Chrome and Safari, but otherwise behaves fine.replychrismorgan 3 hours ago
| parent | next [–]
I do not observe any performance problem in Firefox (Nightly, Linux/Sway), and I’d say text selection is very good, with these caveats:• Caret mode (F7) doesn’t work at all.• Triple click selects all the text on the page, rather than just that of a single <text> element as I’d have expected (in which model you’d use <text> for a paragraph and <tspan> for its lines, and thus get the normal triple-click behaviour).• Click and drag on a text link starts selection or drags the already-selected text, rather than dragging the link so you can drop it in a new tab or such. And if you mouse up on the same link (regardless of having left it), it activates.• If you start a selection, it is only updated while you’re moving over text. Drag past the end of the line, then down, and it should select more text, but it only actually will when you move back over text.• If text is selected, clicking outside text doesn’t clear the selection. (Probably the same root cause.)• Shift+Up and Shift+Down select to the start or end of the containing <text> element, rather than operating linewise. (Because there’s no such thing logically, it’d require heuristic work. Or for people to implement flowed text, like Inkscape did but sadly then it was pulled out of the spec for some reason.)There are also a couple of issues specific to this document:• Document order is not sensible. For example, it goes title, then side nav title, then footer, then body text, then “Home”, then side nav contents, then magic keyword. But this does show a broader problem: in HTML it’s not the easiest to get stupid document ordering (possible, but you have to go a little out of your way), but in SVG it will happen unless you’re careful.• Also likely to happen unless you’re careful: multiline text sometimes lacks the trailing spaces necessary to separate words once the line break is ignored (since there’s no such thing as a line break in SVG 1.1, only a shifted cursor position). For example, “Inkscapefor” fails, whereas “willing to” succeeds.—⁂—Chromium is interesting. Supports caret browsing (+), Up/Down do something weird (−), triple click only selects that <text> element (+), you can’t start a text selection in a link (±), but you can’t drag the link either (=), and while selecting, any time the pointer is not over text, it’ll shift that selection boundary to something like the start of the document (−), except it’s not actually the start because it excludes the title text for some reason.replyjasonjmcghee 4 hours ago

My experience in a chromium-based browser was multiline text selection was not good.Any time you drag over space between lines, it selects something else.replychuckadams 4 hours ago
| root | parent | next [–]
I think that's just the standard behavior of the selection algorithm with that particular layout.
FF might be applying some kind of debouncing or hysteresis to keep it from flickering, but if so it's making all selection sluggish.replybobbylarrybobby 3 hours ago
