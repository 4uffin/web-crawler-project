Arsenal's match on Saturday against Nottingham Forest is the start of a tough month of fixtures for the Gunners. In September they face Forest, Athletic Bilbao, Manchester City and Newcastle in the Champions League and Premier League. They also travel to Port Vale in the Carabao Cup.

The table in the moment it doesn't matter. I just worry about maintaining the same principles. The way we fight for every ball."

Bournemouth's Adam Smith has a suspected hamstring injury and will be out for a few more weeks.
Liverpool will be missing midfielder Curtis Jones against Burnley as Arne Slot confirmed he picked up an injury in their win against Arsenal before the international break.
Man City manager Pep Guardiola confirmed Omar Marmoush came back from the international break injured but should be back in a few weeks - with Rayan Ait Nouri and Rayan Cherki also out of action.

Ruben Amorim's full quote on why Andre Onana had to leave Old Trafford on loan in the transfer window: "I think we understood that this needed a change and sometimes it is hard to point out why. Sometimes it is the moment, the bad luck in some moments."It is hard on him, on us. Our thinking is to have a change in the goalkeepers but I wish the best for Andre Onana."He was really good at working and trying to help the players, but sometimes you can have all the quality in the world but you need a change."

Ruben Amorim on Manchester United's injured trio Matheus Cunha, Mason Mount and Diogo Dalot: "They are out for this game. I don't know how long it is going to take. We need our guys to be a very competitive team but we have very good players who are eager to play, so we will be competitive on Sunday but they are out. They cannot help us in this game."
On how long they will be out for: "I don't want to say. If you talk to Cunha he will say he is able to play this game. So I don't know. We will manage day-by-day. They are pushing really hard and that is a good thing."

Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim confirmed Altay Bayindir would start in goal for Sunday's derby at the Etihad and explained why new signing Senne Lammens will not:"Altay is going to continue. It is a different league, a different country, different training, different ball. So we will try to maintain that and they will fight for the position but for me in this game is clear, Altay will start."On Lammens: "He is a goalkeeper with a lot of potential. I know that we are in a moment where the goalkeeper needs to be really strong and have a lot of experience. We are also in the moment where we have to look at the present but also with a focus on the future - so it is a little bit of both.
He's a guy with a great potential that is one more option [for us] to play, and he will be ready."On why United plumped for Lammens over Aston Villa's Emi Martinez: "We have an option that can give us different things in the moment but also has a great potential to be our goalkeeper for a lot of years so that was out choice in the end."

I agree with Pep I would put Haaland over Isak too, but then I would have Kane over either of them so...MikeRating Haaland higher than these names at this stage in time is ludicrous. He possesses physical attributes like size, height and speed and hangs around near the goal. Perhaps one of the reasons City are so vulnerable in transition.Max

Results dictate the positions and I have to make a good season. "I will not stay if the club feels it needs change. But right now I want to do it more than ever after what happened last season."I am not saying that just because of what I have done in the past. I like to look forward."But the time I am going to stay? When I first joined and signed for three years I would never expected to have stayed for a decade. I am so proud of that. I want to help the team, the club again and again."
