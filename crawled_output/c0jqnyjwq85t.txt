Image source, Getty ImagesJimmy: After a few average weeks, I have chosen to Wildcard. Who is the one player that is an absolute must-have going forward?Antoine Semenyo. Heâs been in red-hot form in the opening four gameweeks, with three goal involvements. Heâs had the most shots (9) and big chances (5) of any midfielder. He has three home games in his next four, against Brighton, Newcastle United and Fulham, plus a trip to promoted Leeds United. Iâm bringing him in this week for Cole Palmer!

Anyone who does not play FPL may well raise their eyebrows if you try to describe the "fear" of making a misstep, but I know exactly what Holly is talking about. I had a wild idea last gameweek to bring in Chris Wood as a differential when I could have afforded to shell out much more. The pain I felt when that plan backfired was all too real.

Floyd: I'm seeing plenty of people using a Free Hit or a Wildcard this game week. Is it really worth it?In my opinion itâs a little too early to wildcard: it always feels like the season gets properly underway after the first international break, but we need a couple of more gameweeks of information and allow time for players to bed in. Free Hit is a fun chip for this week if youâre facing a number of short-term issues, but only play it if your team needs it. Donât be dragged into it through fear!

Image source, Getty ImagesChris: How likely are the teams involved in Europe to start rotating their squads given that the season is still at such an early stage?The Champions League gets underway this midweek, with six Premier League clubs involved, but then those teams have a natural opportunity to rest their players the following midweek and use squad depth for the League Cup fourth round. We do need to factor in fatigue for players who have had a busy international break and long travel times. Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca alluded to this in his news conference today, referencing the energy-sapping trip his Brazil internationals made to play at high altitude in Bolivia.

Image source, Getty ImagesSebastian: If you had to fit in some budget midfielders around Salah and Haaland, who would be in your line up?I think Jack Grealish is excellent value, particularly with the significance of playing his boyhood club Aston Villa this week. Plus, with Cole Palmer seemingly a doubt once again, Enzo Fernandez should be across set pieces and penalties for Chelsea, enhancing his routes to fantasy points. Antoine Semenyo may have risen in price by Â£0.4m already this season, but he still represents great value with form and fixtures.

Image source, Getty ImagesIsaac: I'm on wildcard, and after Slot's comments I'm not sure if I should invest in Isak or Gapko? Do we think Isak will start and be subbed off early, or will we have to wait longer for minutes?I would avoid buying a Liverpool attacker this week, stick with the ones you own now. Thereâs a good chance that Isak makes his full debut at home to Everton in the Merseyside derby in Gameweek 5, but we need to keep track of his minutes against Burnley and in the Champions League next midweek before making those predictions.

Image source, Getty ImagesI've got long-term concerns about whether Mo Salah will be worth the investment, with the arrival of Alexander Isak and a slow-ish start to the season.But after Slot confirmed the Swede is unlikely to play 90 minutes until he reaches full match fitness, Salah seems a safe choice against a leaky Burnley defence.

The trickiest game to predict this week is the Manchester derby. City are favourites but haven't beaten United since March 2024 and have scored just three times in the past four meetings.So that - and City's form - puts me off Erling Haaland in Gameweek 4's Fantasy Premier League team of the week.That could easily backfire but instead I've gone with a team packed with players against the promoted teams and early-season whipping boys Wolves.Team total: Â£97.9mThe team of the week is selected based on current FPL prices to fit within a Â£100m budget, as if you were playing a Free Hit. NB. This team was selected before news of Yoane Wissa's injury.

Which injury doubts are worth a punt and who are just too risky and should be avoided?

Image source, Getty ImagesPicking an Arsenal defender is pretty much a must these days for FPL managers - the defence is that solid.It's not that long ago that Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta saw a title challenge crumble after William Saliba sustained a late-season injury that saw him miss the run-in. Results tailed off after the rock-solid centre-back pairing of Saliba and Gabriel was broken. Arteta has spent the intervening period steadily bolstering his defence and now boasts an embarrassment of riches in defence, meaning that while the team would still miss Saliba they could now potentially cope better with his absence. Arsenal signed 21-year-old Spain centre-back Cristhian Mosquera from Valencia in the summer, who slotted in when Saliba limped off against Liverpool, as well as Ecuador defender Piero Hincapie from Bayer Leverkusen. The Gunners also have Riccardo Calafiori and Jurrien Timber playing as full-backs who could both fill in in the centre of defence, while Ben White has played at centre-back in the past.
