You never quite know what you will get from Ruben Amorim but there is plenty for the Manchester United head coach to discuss when he speaks to the media this lunchtime. It is the first time he will have spoken since deadline day, when United lined up deals for Emi Martinez and Senne Lammens before eventually paying Royal Antwerp Â£18.1m for the 23-year-old Belgian.Since then, Andre Onana has left to join Turkish club Trabzonspor on loan.Amorim is bound to be asked for his rationale behind the move and who will be in goal at Manchester City on Sunday.There has also been no update on the fitness of striker Matheus Cunha and midfielder Mason Mount, who were both injured during the first-half of United's 3-2 win over Burnley on 30 August.Image source, Getty Images

Their season needs a kick start. They need a bit of fresh energy and injection of pace."

Everton so far with some brilliant performances."
