Pep Guardiola on what Gianluigi Donnarumma will bring to his Manchester City team: "He is so tall. He is so huge. All the keepers save shots, bring personality to the team and be a big presence. He has done that in the biggest games. He is going to concede goals but all of us will help him try not to."On what the signing means for James Trafford: "He is a keeper for Man City. I can only play one keeper, I can play two full-backs, two centre-backs. The season is so long everyone will be involved. They may not believe it but they will"

Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola on his new goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma: "I always try to adapt to the quality of the players. I wouldn't demand Gigi [Donnarumma] do something he is uncomfortable with. We are talking about the best player [goalkeeper] I have ever seen with distribution, short and long passes, in Ederson."We didn't take Gigi to do what Ederson has done. Gigi has another quality."

Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola on whether the changes in the squad makes it feel like when he first arrived in 2016:"I had hair back then. Ten years is a long time. But yes [it does] when you change 10 players who were really important."The club helped to make the first step to change over many, many years. At any club there is always changes and when you change 10 players in four five months everything needs to be settled, fixed and consistent. We are still doing many [good] things but we still need to be more consistent than we have been, but step-by-step we will do it."

I can see Bryan Mbeumo hurting City, with United counter-attacking and him being a thorn in their backline chasing balls in behind. I am also not as convinced by City if James Trafford keeps his place in goal.So, I think United will definitely score, but I still cannot go against City at Etihad Stadium because we know they will create chances there.We don't know at the moment is much about Lammens' character or how he will adapt to the Premier League. Is he ready to be United's keeper or not? If Amorim picks Altay Bayindir over him against City, then people are going to scrutinise that decision and ask why on earth he didn't put Lammens in straight away if he rates him so highly.Sutton's prediction: 2-1

Although the 74 charges from the Football Association (FA) imposed on Chelsea were on the minds of some, selection issues will trouble manager Enzo Maresca much more. Star attacker Cole Palmer has only partially trained, while Maresca fears striker Delap is out for as long as "10 to 12 weeks".The club estimate remains that Delap could be back in November with an view to be ready for a busy festive fixture period in December.
Chelsea also lost midfielder Dario Essugo during the international break for up to four months, while Brazilians Joao Pedro, Andrey Santos and Estevao Willian are a doubtful due to a long trip back from a World Cup qualifier in Bolivia. Similarly, star midfielder Moises Caicedo returned from playing in Ecuador. All those mentioned are either doubtful or ruled out. It remains unconfirmed how fit any of Romeo Lavia, Benoit Badiashile and Wesley Fofana are to face Brentford on Saturday evening. Maresca's options are suddenly very limited.

Image source, Getty ImagesYou suspect Eddie Howe will just be glad to speak about players currently on Newcastle United's books moving forward.Although Newcastle have lost one of the best strikers in the world, in Alexander Isak, it feels like the club's season really starts now following a resolution to the saga.Newcastle will at least have some firepower for the visit of Wolves to St James' Park on Saturday after the black-and-whites previously scored just two goals in games against Aston Villa, Liverpool and Leeds United.New signing Yoane Wissa will miss the match with a knee injury, but record arrival Nick Woltemade looks primed to make his debut.The German will clearly need time to adapt after never playing in the Premier League before.But he may have to be thrown straight in - just as Isak was after joining Newcastle in 2022.

Lee: Good to see Toadie from Neighbours still has a great sense of humour. Whoever United put in goal, they will struggle. Like their manager never being replaced since Fergie left, their keeper has never been properly replaced since Schmeichel. De Gea was good, but not brilliant overall.
