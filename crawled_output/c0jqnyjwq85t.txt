Everton so far with some brilliant performances."

Brighton boss Fabian Hurzeler on Carlos Baleba, who was linked with Manchester United during the summer transfer window: "He demands a lot from himself. He always wants to play perfect. He always wants to do special things. But in these moments, it's very important to focus just on the basics, to focus on the things you can influence. We try to give him the right advice in that case, and then I'm sure that he will be back in the shape as soon as possible, as quick as possible, but it's very important that we don't put too much pressure under him, because I think that's not the right thing to work with."

He's trained well and I'm really pleased with how he has looked in the first days. It's a big change for him, a big opportunity as well. "He's got a great nature and a great character.

Arne Slot is always very careful about his words but it was clear he feels Marc Guehi has been hard done by.The Liverpool manger described the situation as a "pity" for all involved, but stopped short there, saying the England defender is "in a good place playing at Crystal Palace, winning the FA Cup and Charity Shield with a very good manager".As for Alexander Isak - there was plenty of questions on his protracted British-record Â£125m transfer from Newcastle and Slot was happy to field them. I was interested to ask about how much contact they'd had up to now and it would appear, not much. "People may not believe me but I haven't spoken to him that much." Slot said with a smile, adding "although it is very important how someone is because we have a great culture at this club... We mainly sign a player for his qualities."Image source, Getty Images
