Here's the full quotes from Liverpool manager Arne Slot on his attempts to sign Marc Guehi: "I think it would be ridiculous if I was to deny that we were close to signing him. These things happen in football and it has happened to our players in the past that they thought they were so close to signing somewhere else and then at the last moment things changed, this can happen."For me, we would have liked to have signed him of course because we were in for him and if we feel we can strengthen the team with a chance in the market then we will not hesitate to do so and that is what we tried to do."We played Arsenal and [Ibrahima] Konate and [Virgil] van Dijk played an outstanding game and Joe Gomez came in 20 minutes before the end and did good as well. With us signing Giovanni Leoni who had his first international call up, it's not like all of a sudden we don't have options in that position anymore."It is a pity, not only for us but for the player I think. He is in a good place playing at Crystal Palace where he won the FA Cup and Charity Shield with a very good manager as well."Let's see what the future brings for him and for us."

Liverpool manager Arne Slot on deadline day: "A lot of things happened on the last day which is not always the situation as last season we hardly did anything in the whole window."The thing that pleases me most is us getting the deal for Alex [Isak] over the line, everyone involved worked so hard to get the deal done. It's good for the club, for the fans, for the players and for me that all the work they have put in resulted in Alex signing for us."

Andre Onana's loan move to Trabzonspor was confirmed last night.After initially being told by Ruben Amorim he was going to be first choice this season, the Manchester United goalkeeper has now found himself surplus to requirements.The hamstring injury he sustained right at the start of pre-season training, which meant he had no warm-up games prior to the first Premier League game against Arsenal, and the mistake he made in the EFL Cup defeat at League Two Grimsby have not helped in that regard.While the rights and wrongs of Senne Lammens' arrival can be debated, the Belgian has clearly been bought with an eye on the future.It means Onana - whose United contract runs to 2028 - has almost certainly played his last game for the Old Trafford outfit.The Trabzonspor move may be a loan - but I doubt he will return to United in any meaningful capacity.

The transfer window is closed in England but remains open in Turkey until Friday evening - and a notable deal was confirmed late on Thursday.Manchester United keeper Andre Onana has joined Trabzonspor on loan for the rest of season.The Cameroon international has not featured in United's opening three Premier League games. His only appearance was a nervy display in their shock EFL Cup exit at the hands of League Two Grimsby.The 29-year-old was signed from Inter Milan for Â£47.2m in July 2023 by former Old Trafford boss Erik ten Hag to replace David de Gea as United's number one.But his United spell has been punctuated by a number of mistakes and Belgian goalkeeper Senne Lammens, 23, was signed on deadline day from Royal Antwerp in a deal worth an initial 21m euros (Â£18.1m) plus add-ons.Image source, Getty Images

No surprise that Jack Grealish is back with a bang. He is a natural talent, with a great outlook on life. He was never destined for the false starts and disappointments endured by Rashford, Lingard and Sancho.Peter Gilks, Rye

I'm just fascinated to see how it works, they've already got [Florian] Wirtz and [Hugo] Ekitike so it's a very new look front line for Liverpool this season."I'm not exactly sure what the combination of players will be in the front three but he is such a brilliant player and he's proven that at Newcastle United in the last few years."

Sun: Burnley (A)
Wed: Atletico Madrid (H - CL)
20 Sep: Everton (H)
23 Sep: Southampton (H - EFL Cup)

There has been a lot of criticism towards Florian Wirtz so far this season. I believe during the fixtures leading into the next international break everyone will see what all the fuss is about! If Isak hits the ground running as well Liverpool will take some shifting from top spot.Shane Eddy
