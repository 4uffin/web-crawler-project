Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner gave an update on player injuries ahead of Saturday's game against Sunderland: "Fortunately, all the international players came back healthy and fit so that everybody of them is available. The injured players are progressing very well."At the moment it looks like Adam Wharton, Ismaila Sarr and Eddie Nketiah are available at least against Liverpool, so in two weeks. "Tomorrow none of them are available. Millwall [EFL Cup], none of them is available, maybe Adam and Eddie have a chance for West Ham.âAll the new signings will be in the squad tomorrow. There is a good chance that Yeremy Pino will make his starting debut for Crystal Palace tomorrow."He just needed to rest during the international break. The first week of the international break he didn't train. He had a small injury from his last game at Villarreal. But then he started preparing on Monday."

More from Oliver Glasner on the fallout from Marc Guehi's failed move to Liverpool:"I didn't have to threaten anybody. There were no bad tensions between the chairman and myself. It was really just a discussion about sports, and he decided against the money and for the sporting perspective of Crystal Palace. So again, big credit to the chairman, and the same big credit to Marc, who handled it very well."We [Guwhi] talked on deadline day. We talked the day after deadline day, when he was already in the England camp and was always very honest. Everybody could see how he played for England, that he's 100% focused, the same here."And it was written [in media] that he steps back as our captain. Nothing true. He will be our captain as long as he's here, because he's just such a great player and such a great personality and so much noise."That is the truth."

Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner discusses deadline day after Marc Guehi's failed Â£35m Liverpool transfer spurred on rumours of tension between Glasner and his chairman Steve Parish: "I never threatened to leave the club, never."At the end of many discussions it was the chairman who asked me 'Oliver, do you think we can manage the season when we sell Marc?' I said 'honestly we can't manage it in the short-term'"If we buy a 19 year old, fantastic player with about 1000 minutes in the league and sell our captain with about 15,000 minutes in the Premier League. I think we can't manage it short term. And if then we have three centre-backs and with our schedule, and if we have an injury in the back three. I think it's very, very risky."If you want this scenario for Crystal Palace and you are fine with it. Sell Marc, if you don't want to have this, then we have to keep him. And then he decided we keep him."

Aston Villa boss Unai Emery has provided a squad news update ahead of Saturday's match.He says Jadon Sancho, Harvey Elliott and Victor Lindelof will be in the squad this weekend but are all in "different circumstances": "Sancho was not training with the group and physically he will need time. Harvey was training and playing consistently with Liverpool and is more or less fit. Lindelof was training individually and he is available to be with us but he will need time to know us tactically."Elsewhere in the squad, Emery added: "Matty Cash is available. We have some players injured who are close, [Andres] Garcia, [Boubacar] Kamara and [Amadou] Onana. Ross Barkley has a personal issue and I think he will come back and be available soon, but not yet."

"I didn't really want to lose that amount of goals out of the building but at the same time I was very understanding of the way this club works and the medium to long-term future of the club is very important."
