Newcastle United manager Eddie Howe on what lessons the club has learned following the protracted Alexander Isak transfer saga to Liverpool: "That's for another day and for probably people behind the scenes to reflect on. For me I have just got to focus on the future and look forward."On the summer transfer window as a whole, which included big money attacking signings of Nick Woltemade in a deal worth up to Â£69m, as well as Yoane Wissa for Â£55m: "It was a challenging window but also a successful window hopefully. Time will be the best judgement of that. Our clear focus now is just the football. There are no off-the-pitch distractions and we are looking forward to that."He added: "I am excited by the possibilities of this squad."

Eddie Howe was asked what timescale the Newcastle medical staff have put on Yoane Wissa's recovery from injury and whether he could be fit to face Barcelona in the Champions League on 18 September: "I don't know. I think he will go away for tests and maybe see a specialist to see. Unfortunately I can't give you that update."

Newcastle United manager Eddie Howe on Jacob Ramsey being out until after the next international break in October: "Jacob Ramsey is the only other injury concern we have. He will miss the game having suffered from that tackle against Leeds. His ankle swelled up at halftime and he had to come off. Unfortunately I think he will be missing until after the next international break so that is a big blow."On Joelinton's return to fitness: "Joe has trained. He has been fit and available and looked good. Really happy to have him back and he is an important player."Image source, Getty Images

Newcastle United manager Eddie Howe started by looking ahead to a "storm of games" in September: "Hugely important for us. We always knew with the schedule how the early part of this season would look for us, kind of a slow start with week-to-week games then bang. We are going to be into a storm of games and that's what we want.
It's going to be a great period for us in terms of challenges - quick turnarounds. We are going to need the whole squad ready to play."

Newcastle United manager Eddie Howe on whether Yoane Wissa will be fit to face Wolves: "Unfortunately not, no. He won't make this game, I saw him for the first time yesterday. He's feeling the effects of the injury he sustained just before he came off. So we are going to have to see how he is."On why Newcastle were willing to pay Brentford Â£55m to sign him: "An established Premier League goalscorer is very difficult to find and difficult to recruit. He has got great qualities, he had an outstanding year not just last year but before, so he's got a history of scoring goals. "He's done well against us and been a difficult player for us to handle when we have come up against him and I really admire the journey he has been on to get to this point because it has not been easy for him. "He has had big steps to make in his career but he has always adjusted and made them and hopefully he can do the same with us."

Image source, Getty ImagesNewcastle had 34 shots in their opening two games of the season and their lack of cutting edge very much showed.In brand new number nine Yoanne Wissa, they have a Premier League proven goalscorer who found the net 19 times in the league for Brentford last season.For Eddie Howe, the signing of 6ft 6in Nick Woltemade provides a completely different option and will allow Newcastle to head up their attack in two very different ways.With only one striking spot likely to be available in their starting eleven, it seems Wissa may get the nod should Howe choose to give the 23 year old German time to adapt to a new a league.You could be forgiven for thinking Woltemade is a throwback centre forward, but the towering striker is technically gifted - comfortable wriggling it out of tight spaces and linking play - and has even been nicknamed 'Woltemessi' by Bayern Munich goalkeeper Manuel Neuer.He scored 17 goals in 33 games for Stuttgart last season, including the opener in the German Cup final, as the striker won the first major trophy of his career.

Image source, Getty ImagesIn July 2021, a month before he joined Brentford from Lorient, Yoanne Wissa was attacked at his home, with acid thrown in his face. He could have lost his sight. It could have ended his career.But it didn't.He was playing in front of crowds of fewer than 3,000 supporters away at Chambly in the French second division back in 2019.Now he is in line to feature against Barcelona in the Champions League next week after completing a protracted Â£55m move from Brentford to Newcastle United.His rise has not necessarily come as a shock to Pierre-Yves Hamel, who played alongside Wissa at Lorient."After the attack, he never complained," he said. "He immediately wanted to move forward and to blossom today is a just reward for his efforts."Once Yoane has an idea in mind, he will do his utmost to make it happen - no matter how long it takes."

Quite a lot has happened since Newcastle United head coach Eddie Howe last faced the
media following a goalless draw against Leeds United 13 days ago.Yoane Wissa has completed a Â£55m move from Brentford. David
Hopkinson has been appointed as the clubâs new CEO. Oh, and Alexander Isak has
left after sealing a British record move to Liverpool.Isak has kept his counsel on the circumstances surrounding his departure and you suspect Howe wonât necessarily want to go into great
detail, either, when he is asked about a player who is no
longer on the clubâs books today.The big question is: who will lead the line against Wolves
on Saturday?Do Newcastle go with Wissa, who knows the Premier
League well, but who has had a long journey back from international duty with
DR Congo? Or does Howe start record signing Nick Woltemade, who has
had a little more time training with his new team-mates, but will need an
adaptation period?Image source, Getty Images

Liverpool manager Arne Slot on having quality going forward: "Yes [we do have it with the new signings] but if the question is 'is that the first time?' then the answer is no. Last season I could change games around with Diogo [Jota] with Darwin [Nunez] and with Lucho [Diaz], the three players that are not here."That is what a club like Liverpool could do in the past, this is a normal at a club like Liverpool to have options to change the game if necessary."

Image source, Getty ImagesArne Slot on Harvey Elliott: "Another positive thing, not only Harvey [Elliott] but if I look at Luis Diaz and how he hit the ground running at Bayern Munich it is a big compliment for our performance staff and the people that work in this building. "Harvey is in a very good place going to a very nice club in Aston Villa and it is in the interest of everyone as he did not get the playing time he probably deserved for the quality that he has and he conducted himself always so well, he acted inside with him not playing so much. He was always doing whatever was best for the club and he deserves a big compliment for that."Everybody always talks about Mo [Salah] and Virgil [Van Dijk] if we win the league but players like him were the reason we could win it because he was positive even when he would only play five or ten minutes to help the team. That is partly the success of the team and I think he is ready to show his quality at Aston Villa."

Image source, Getty ImagesArne Slot on Alexander Isak making his debut: "The Swedish manager
[Jon Dahl Tomasson] deserves a big, big compliment because he gets maybe the best striker in the world and he needs to play two very important games for his country but understands that if he would play him twice for 90 minutes then the player would be injured for multiple weeks and that is not always easy for a manager that he takes care of the interest of a player."We will treat Alex [Isak] the same as they did so don't expect him to be [playing] every single game 90 minutes on the pitch as that is definitely not going to happen in the upcoming weeks."He missed a proper pre-season and I think he missed three to four months of team sessions so now we have to build him up gradually with us playing so many games. That is going to be a challenge but we have not signed him for the next two weeks we have signed him for six years and the fans have to keep this in mind."

Image source, Getty ImagesHere's the full quotes from Liverpool manager Arne Slot on his attempts to sign Marc Guehi: "I think it would be ridiculous if I was to deny that we were close to signing him. These things happen in football and it has happened to our players in the past that they thought they were so close to signing somewhere else and then at the last moment things changed, this can happen."For me, we would have liked to have signed him of course because we were in for him and if we feel we can strengthen the team with a chance in the market then we will not hesitate to do so and that is what we tried to do."We played Arsenal and [Ibrahima] Konate and [Virgil] van Dijk played an outstanding game and Joe Gomez came in 20 minutes before the end and did good as well. With us signing Giovanni Leoni who had his first international call up, it's not like all of a sudden we don't have options in that position anymore."It is a pity, not only for us but for the player I think. He is in a good place playing at Crystal Palace where he won the FA Cup and Charity Shield with a very good manager as well."Let's see what the future brings for him and for us."
