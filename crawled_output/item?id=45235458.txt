>If the resulting software is so poor you need to hire a human specialist software engineer to come in and rewrite the vibe coded software, it defeats the entire purpose.I don't think this is entirely true. In a lot of cases vibe coding something can be a good way to prototype something and see how users respond. Obviously don't do it for something where security is a concern, but that vibe-coded skin cancer recognition quiz that was on the front page the other day is a good example.replybravetraveler 2 hours ago

Like Red Teams for InfoSec, reliability teams meet developers. Not new, but keep pumping Gig Culture/the fad, I guess.replysshine 45 minutes ago

That’s a good comparison.But at another scale.I tell my CS students who ask if there will be any junior positions for them when they graduate:There will be an entire new industry of people who vibed 1000 lines of MVP and now are stuck with something they can’t debug. It’s not called a junior developer, but it’s called someone who actually knows programming.Also, they will continue to deliver code that is full of security holes, because programming teachers are often not competent to teach those aspects, and IT security professionals who teach tend to be poor programmers or paper pushers.replywesturner 6 hours ago
