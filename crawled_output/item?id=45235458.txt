Well, I'm sure we've all seen code produced by human developers that is 10x worse than what my Claude Code produces (certainly I have), so let's be real. And it's improving scary fast.replynickstambaugh 8 hours ago

I think the bar has raised, for sure. There's code I work on from prior seniors that is worse than what our current juniors write, I'm assuming AI is assisting with that but as long as the PR looks good, it's no different to me.replytrenchpilgrim 6 hours ago

I've noticed that generally OK design patterns and sticking to idiomatic code has increased while attention to small but critical details remains the same or maybe slightly decreased.replydmitrygr 5 hours ago

Hard disagree. Humans fail in ways I know, can predict, and know where to look for. ML coding assistants fail in all sorts of idiotic ways and thus every damn line needs to be scrutinized.replyEkaros 4 hours ago

What actually scares me is the idea that with humans you can manage to follow their train of thought. But if LLM just rewrites everything each time, well that is impossible to follow and then there is same work to be done over and over again each review.replyscrollaway 2 hours ago

>If the resulting software is so poor you need to hire a human specialist software engineer to come in and rewrite the vibe coded software, it defeats the entire purpose.I don't think this is entirely true. In a lot of cases vibe coding something can be a good way to prototype something and see how users respond. Obviously don't do it for something where security is a concern, but that vibe-coded skin cancer recognition quiz that was on the front page the other day is a good example.replyFearNotDaniel 9 hours ago

Exactly… back in 1975 Fred Brooks was advising programmers to “plan to throw the first version away” (The Mythical Man-Month) and it’s still true today. Just the tools to build that rapid prototype that have changed. Once it was Ruby on Rails, once it was Visual Basic 6, very often it’s still Excel macros…replythegrim33 6 hours ago

Wasn't part of throwing away the first version because of all the knowledge you gain while actually building it? So that you could build it much better the second time, with much better abstractions/design? If you had AI code it the first time, you don't gain that same knowledge.replydaanlo 6 hours ago

You still do from operating the software.
You see what problems users have using it, which types of problems they tackle with it.
By the end of running the software for a month you will have typically learned a boat load.replyAnalemma_ 2 hours ago

But you and the parent are both ignoring that, in the real world, prototypes constantly (in fact, nearly always) get shipped straight to production and not updated or rewritten, precisely because they solve a pressing problem, and if they solve it well they get real users right away who start bringing up new feature requests and bugs before the prototype can ever be fixed.This was a constant pattern in software engineering even before LLMs, but LLMs are making it much worse, and I think it's very head-in-the-sand behavior to ignore that. It's akin to going "well, you can't blame the Autopilot because the person should have been fully-attentive ready to react at any millisecond". That's not how humans work, and good engineering is supposed to take real-world human behavior into considerationreplyantonvs 9 hours ago

I've spent a good chunk of my career fixing or rewriting messes created by human developers. A majority of startups that succeed need this at some point, whether it's because of time and resource constraints during initial development, experience and competence issues, poor choices that got baked in, or whatever.Right now, vibe coding just means there might be a lot more of this, assuming vibe coding succeeds well enough to compete with the situations I described.replybravetraveler 15 hours ago

Like Red Teams for InfoSec, reliability teams meet developers. Not new, but keep pumping Gig Culture/the fad, I guess.replysshine 13 hours ago

That’s a good comparison.But at another scale.I tell my CS students who ask if there will be any junior positions for them when they graduate:There will be an entire new industry of people who vibed 1000 lines of MVP and now are stuck with something they can’t debug. It’s not called a junior developer, but it’s called someone who actually knows programming.Also, they will continue to deliver code that is full of security holes, because programming teachers are often not competent to teach those aspects, and IT security professionals who teach tend to be poor programmers or paper pushers.replynpoc 9 hours ago

That will only be a temporary phase while LLMs still produce bugs that LLMs can't predict or fix themselves.replyPhemist 8 hours ago

Probably simultaneously, LLMs will perpetuate faulty MVPs that need fixing for the viber economy, while at the same time, all those AI engineering problems get solved, but only for those who know how to ask.replykarl_p 5 hours ago

As the mythical man month says: never ship the prototype.
Plan to write one and then throw it away.replyforeigner 4 hours ago

I have literally never seen that happen in practice. The prototype code always evolves to become the product.replydatadrivenangel 3 hours ago

From my relevant post last week:> AI now lets anyone write software, but it has limits. People will call upon software practitioners to fix their AI-generated code.https://www.slater.dev/about-that-gig-fixing-vibe-code-slop/replyrighthand 6 hours ago

I get two types of merge requests nowadays. The first is a traditional piece of code. Something simple like a bit of marketing text to a page or a new react component that adds another css effect to some content. The second type is a long complex merge request, for something more complex than a menu (not really though)…tabs, uses new dependencies, none of the old dependencies, is filled with emdashed code comments about personal dev choices (instead of logic flow or business context), and the core file convention is named after the implementers library choice: `react-tabs`. If I bring up any of these issues with the implementer they tell me “we can fix it later and they need to just get it out”.The first type of merge request is one that should be generated by an LLM and the second is one that should be generated by a human.Instead I get neither but I get efficiency so someone can deliver at the last minute. And so I can can go mop up the work later or my job is hell the next time “we just need to get this out the door”.THANK YOU LLMSreplyKinrany 5 hours ago

| root | parent | next [–]
No; it doesn't care when it gives you incomplete garbage.You have to tell it to validate its own work by adding to, refactoring, and running the tests before it replies.Most junior developers do care and would never dump partial solutions on a prompter as though they're sufficient like LLMs.Every time I remember to get `make test-coverage` working and have myself or the LLM focus on lines that aren't covered by tests.Junior or Senior,
an employee wouldn't turn in such incomplete, not compiling assignments that % of the time; even given inadequate prompts as specifications.replyttoinou 8 hours ago

If you’re hiring someone remotely without any trust you could absolutely get random garbage that pretend to be real work from a human.A human software developer doesn't code in the void, he interacts with others.The same when you have an AI coder, you interact with it. It's not fire and forget.replysysguest 12 hours ago

Context limits (regardless of hard limits) are a show stopper IMO, the models completely fail assignments with >= 30k LoC (or so) codebases.You're better off feeding them a few files to work with, in isolation, if you can.replywesturner 8 hours ago

I'd take tests over docs but that's a false dilemma.What does the (Copilot) /tests command do, compared to a prompt like "Generate tests for #symbolname, run them, and modify the FUT function under test and run the tests in a loop until the tests pass"?Documentation is probably key to the Django web framework's success, for example.Resources useful for learning to write great docs:
