Sounds more like "reconstruction" than "restoration". I appreciate many original parts may be too damaged, but it risks becoming an archeological Disneyland.replycm2187 6 minutes ago

I don't see the problem. If a building is damaged we should not reconstruct it? I'd much rather see the Colosseum in its original state, covered in marble, than the current state, after centuries of neglect and looting from the italians.replyaetherspawn 3 hours ago

There is a prophecy in the Bible that says Babylon will never successfully be rebuilt. Isa 13:19, 20.replyeth0up 1 hour ago

'Building yesteryear's history today' for tourism, like so many "historical" sites.replyeth0up 4 hours ago

Screw the tourists, bring in the archeologists, maybe start by resuming excavations at Eridu. 99% of our history is buried or looted. And the one or two Assyriologists in the world need new material to study.replyroshin 3 hours ago

After several years, Iraqi Hezbollah recently released their Princeton researcher hostage (granted, she is a dual Israeli citizen). Maybe that will encourage more archeologists to visit.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Tsurkovreplyeth0up 1 hour ago

Tourism is such a wasteful tax on society. I met an Egyptologist who had been leading tours for two years so he could feed his family but he longed to go back to Egyptology and go and study the ruins even though it didn’t pay wellreplybcraven 2 hours ago

And after meeting that person you thought, "wow I wish this person didn't have an alternative income stream that allows them to feed their family"?Many people in this world wish they could do something different with their lives, but to blame the activity they're currently doing is shortsighted.replynashashmi 2 hours ago

lol. Sure I felt happy that he had something else to keep his family fed. But I as a tourist with more valuable cash come into this country with an artificially low value cash, take up the very resources of that country to … give me a tour!
This guy is probably a skilled archeologist who made a huge effort to learn history of an ancient civilization and was actually able to translate whatever we asked him to translate.And here he is could be doing something so much more valuable … than giving this idiot (me) a “tour”.I am appreciative that I met him. And that he was my guide. But my money didn’t give him an income. It took away the finite resources of his country.replyAlotOfReading 1 hour ago

People generally become tour guides because alternative jobs don't exist. It's extremely common for the local workers who help with excavation to become tour guides for the areas they've helped excavate. Many of these people are more knowledgeable (in certain respects) than the archaeologists they're helping.I'm fairly certain you weren't taking him away from something more valuable that he would have been doing in your absence.reply
