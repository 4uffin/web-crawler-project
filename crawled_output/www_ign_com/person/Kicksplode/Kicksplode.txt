Jesse became part of the IGN staff in 2019, after freelancing for the company since 2007. Jesse's work has also appeared on Fandango, Moviefone and About.com.
Jesse is married with two children, so leisure time is but a distant memory to him. But during those late nights when everyone is asleep, he can usually be found
reading, catching up on superhero shows, listening to music or obsessively watching YouTube videos about watches he can't afford.
