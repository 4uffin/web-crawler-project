She spent most of her life in Kingston, Ontario, before deciding to brave the humidity in Washington, DC.
Blythe’s love of video games stretches back to playing Sly Cooper on PS2 with her brother.

Outside of gaming, she tries to catch every new horror movie in theaters and can't seem to stop watching reality TV.
