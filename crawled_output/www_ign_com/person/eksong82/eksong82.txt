When Eric isn't hunting for deals for other people at work, he's hunting for deals for himself during his free time. The best deal he's recently found was a LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon 751982 kit for about $200 (normally $800) thanks to a Target price error. When he's not racking up freemogems in Genshin Impact or attempting to lose weight with Beat Saber, Eric's out in the Pacific ocean on his kayak fishing for salmon and halibut.Latest from Eric SongLatestVideosArticlesReviewsGuide Edits3h ago3h ago - A great price for an entry level bike with a 32mph top speed and up to 70 mile range.Eric Song3h ago3h ago - The Paper Pro Move has all the features of the Paper Pro in a more pocketable form factor.Eric Song53h ago3h ago - You won't find a less expensive (and still well-made) 3D printer anywhere else.Eric Song14h ago4h ago - It also happens to be on sale today.Alienware m16Eric Song5h ago5h ago - Save $150 compared to buying it from the Apple Store.Eric Song17h ago7h ago - Falling GPU prices are also lowering prices on premium prebuit gaming PCs.Alienware Aurora R16Eric Song18h ago8h ago - Say goodbye to buying compressed air canisters in bulk.Eric Song39h ago9h ago - Perfect for laptops and power hungry gaming handhelds like the Asus ROG Ally X and Legion Go S.AllyEric Song10h ago10h ago - Including new Alienware Area-51 gaming PCs and laptops.Alienware Aurora R15Eric Song10511h ago11h ago - Don't miss this opportunity to save extra on gaming handhelds, PS5 consoles, electric bikes, and more.Eric SongLoad MoreReviews•Editor Columns•News•Guides•Upcoming Sales Events•How to Watch Guides•Board Game Reviews•GTA 5 Cheats•Best Streaming Bundles•IGN Store•Top Deals•Contact Us•IGN YouTube•HowLongToBeat•IGN TikTok•IGN Twitter•Map Genie•Eurogamer•Rock Paper Shotgun•VG247•Maxroll•Privacy Policy•Terms of Use
