He has worked in games media since 2002, spending the first decade of his career at Official Xbox Magazine before joining IGN in 2012. He is the host of Podcast Unlocked and IGN Unfiltered, as well as a co-host of Next-Gen Console Watch. His first console was the original Nintendo Entertainment System.
When he's not playing video games, he's either talking about electric cars on his weekly Tesla podcast, Ride the Lightning, or walking his Boxer dog, Daisy. Follow him on Twitter at @DMC_Ryan.
