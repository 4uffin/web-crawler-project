Right now the Amyet V9-G60 Electric Bike with 1,000W (1,500W peak) motor and 48V 20AH battery is on sale for just $477.47 after you apply $100 off coupon code "USDEAL100" during checkout. You're buying it from Amyet's official store on AliExpress. It ships free locally from the United States and arrives within 1 to 2 weeks. You'd be hard pressed to find a new electric bike for under $500 stateside, especially one that has a 1,000W motor (the least expensive bikes cost more and are usually rated for 750W). The same bike is priced at $500 plus $165 shipping on Amazon, so you'd paying nearly $200 more buying it from there.Amyet V9-G60 Electric Bike for $477.47PRESENTED BY:@AliExpressAmyet V9-G60 1,000W Electric Bike109$899.00 save 47%$477.47 at AliExpressUse code 'USDEAL100'Get an extra $50 cash back on this purchase from RetailmenotThis week only, our sister site Retailmenot is offering an extra 30% off cashback on all purchases at AliExpress up to $50 in maximum rewards.

Retailmenot is reputable; your cashback earnings are deposited into your Retailmenot account, and then you can transfer that balance to PayPal or Venmo and treat it like cash.The Amyet V9-G60 electric bike has a 1,000W (1,500W peak) brushless motor that can push the bike at speeds up to 32MPH. It's powered off a large 48V 20AH (960Whr) battery that provides between 30 to 70 miles on a single charge. An LCD display provides real-time information on your speed, battery level, and more.The bike's lightweight aluminum frame keeps the weight down to about 77 pounds, which is respectable considering the oversized battery (a 960Whr battery is heavy). The weight limit for this bike is 330 pounds. It uses Shimano components for its 7-speed gear shift system and dual suspension. The 20" wheels are equipped with 4" fat tires, which are versatile on soft or rough terrain and they cushion against imperfections in the road for a more comfortable ruide. Safety features include mechanical dual disc brakes, electric horn, headlights, turn signals, and brake lights.The bike comes 90% preassembled so you can take it out for a spin in a matter of minutes. It's also pretty mod friendly in case you wanted to do your own upgrades (like swapping to hydraulic brakes). It's covered by a 12 month warranty. The Amyet G60 is an entry level bike that doesn't quite measure up to the build quality or features of other (far) more expensive e-bikes, but it's an amazing value and a great way for newcomers to try out an assisted bike at home without having to invest thousands of dollars. Just a year ago you'd be paying $700-$1,000 for the same bike.How to Follow IGN Deals RecommendationsThe IGN Deals team has over 30 years of combined experience finding the best discounts and preorders available online.
