Compared to Lumiose City as it appeared in the Pokémon X and Pokémon Y games, released in 2013, more greenery now adorns the city, alongside facilities with a cutting-edge feel.
In Lumiose City, spaces frequented by people—such as shopping arcades, cafés, and restaurants—coexist with more natural areas, such as waterfronts and verdant parks. At the center of Lumiose stands Prism Tower, the very symbol of the city.Content RatingFantasy ViolenceDevelopersGame FreakPublishersNintendo, The Pokemon CompanyFranchisesPokemonInitial ReleaseOct 16, 2025PlatformsGenresAction, RPGHowLongToBeat--Main Story--Story + Sides--Everything--All StylesGame HelpPokemon Legends: Z-A GuideOpen GuideTop Guide SectionsCharactersStarter PokemonMega Dimension DLCNew Mega Pokemon in Legends Z-APokedex (List of Pokemon)Pokemon Legends: Z-A NewsLatestVideosArticlesTrailers11h ago11h ago - Plus some handy advice on how to save up $187.49 when buying.Nintendo Switch 2Robert Anderson23d ago3d ago - Closing out the original Switch era.Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals TimeBlythe Dujardin1963d ago3d ago - Including new amiiboKirby Air RidersChristian Wait23d ago3d ago - Payday.Pokemon Legends: Z-ATom Phillips6720:405d ago5d agoAlien: Rogue Incursiontayo_oyekan + 3 more8:346d ago6d agoDonkey Kong Bananza16d ago6d ago - Shock.Pokemon Legends: Z-ATom Phillips110:436d ago6d agoPokemon Legends: Z-A - Mega Dimension21:296d ago6d agoPokemon Legends: Z-A15:247d ago7d ago - IP lawyers and experts are concerned.BioShockDaemon Hatfield5Load MoreReviews•Editor Columns•News•Guides•Upcoming Sales Events•How to Watch Guides•Board Game Reviews•GTA 5 Cheats•Best Streaming Bundles•IGN Store•Top Deals•Contact Us•IGN YouTube•HowLongToBeat•IGN TikTok•IGN Twitter•Map Genie•Eurogamer•Rock Paper Shotgun•VG247•Maxroll•Privacy Policy•Terms of Use
