In the past, we could have made a version of Signal without this spyware, to be installed as an APK (as I would expect the EU to force Google to ban the non-spying version from the app store). With the upcoming Android developer verification, this will no longer be a possibility.replyuserbinator 5 minutes ago

There are plenty of devices running older versions of Android which are not under Big G's control and won't be subjected to this authoritarianism. Coincidentally they are also likely to be easily rootable, so you can still have full freedom.Just don't "upgrade" and ignore all the propaganda telling you bad things about that. Keep building apps that work on older, less-hostile devices and spread the word to oppose this very deliberate planned obsolescence.replyjofla_net 1 hour ago

The thing that depresses me about offhand references to bilderberg group is it's a missed chance to name real names. I don't know who they are, but from chat gpt'ing it looks like there's some particular agencies regularly behind these. One is "DG Home," an EU department on security that drafts legislation.Another is Europol, a security coordination body that can't legislate but frequently advocates for this kind of legislation.And then there's LEWP, The law enforcement working party, a "working group" comprised of security officials from member EU states, also involved in EU policy making in some capacity.Perhaps targeted reform of these bodies is in order so they don't keep producing this legislation over and over. The blocking minority shouldn't just oppose the legislation itself, but make sure that their representation at those bodies is stopping those recommendations from getting out of those various EU bodies.replyvarispeed 18 minutes ago

The nazis had income tax rates virtually identical to most modern European countries, which was not at all common globally at the time.Also they had wealth exit taxes just like modern Socialists in Europe are fighting for right now: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reich_Flight_TaxI've now listed about 10 different major similarities, but if you'd like I can go on with more similarities.Modern socialists in Europe are also starting to turn against immigration and toward ethnic nationalism as well.This is a fundamental dark truth about socialism; it leads to anti-immigrant backlash. When the collective is paying for a lot of social welfare, they tend to get upset when people they perceive as 'other' come in and start to enjoy the fruits of the collective pie.You can 1:1 map anti-immigrant policy in the US with the rise of the social welfare state starting in the 1930s.replyslater 31 minutes ago

If you think there's a hard definition of socialism that Hitler clearly falls outside of, I'm pretty sure you're wrong. They blamed rich people for all the ills of society (Jewish people for them); they believed in the state running the economy through "corporatism"; they believed in a disarmed population that relies on the state for planning and protection; and they were willing to sacrifice millions of their populace to get there.

Yuck your use of "socialist".Yes I know that in English-speaking countries, especially the USA, it is often a shortcut for communist tyranny.But for f*ck's sake, that obliterates anything political that is driven towards increasing the overall happiness of the society, and not focusing on increasing the material wealth, acknowledging the disconnect between the two.And yes the above uses the adjective "socialist", so that would be totally lost in your usage of the word.replyswinglock 38 minutes ago

Thank you.For others this is the last para of the first link:> The Swedish government has proposed new legislation that would allow police to wiretap children under the age of 15 in an attempt to curb the violence, according to the BBC.So, Chat Control is an attempt by a few politicians to give police some tools to prevent teenagers from shooting each other in gang wars.
It's a real problem, it needs a real solution, this looks to be an honest attempt to come up with one - from someone who doesn't know what they are doing.Interestingly, we've had an uptick in youth violence here in Australia too.
It feels eerily similar.
It's happening in the same demographic, it's happening while crime overall is dropping, and the authorities here too are struggling to control it.
It's so serious it lead to a change of government at the last election.
A right wing mob got in by beating the law and order drum with the slogan "Adult Crime, Adult Time".

> Who, exactly, is so strongly motivated to make such legislation?For the part that Denmark is playing, I think the answer is somewhat readily found in the current national politics of Denmark. We've just had a pretty prominent politician 7 years ago get convicted of being in possession of CSAM. I think that's very personally offensive to our current prime minister. That has to be viewed along with her personal view of herself as the "children's prime minister", to make it into a double whammy.We've also been dealing an inability of the police to investigate some crime, and the investigative committee established to figure out what to do about it recommended an ability for police to more readily be able to investigate digital material.

>(12a) In the light of the more limited risk of their use for the purpose of child sexual abuse and the need to preserve confidential information, including classified information, information covered by professional secrecy and trade secrets, electronic communications services that are not publicly available, such as those used for national security purposes, should be excluded from the scope of this Regulation. Accordingly, this Regulation should not apply to interpersonal communications services that are not available to the general public and the use of which is instead restricted to persons involved in the activities of a particular company, organisation, body or authority.From document 11277/24 [1].
Unless it has changed more recently, the exemption is actually considerably broader, and presents the unusual argument that the system will be secure enough for any private personal communications, yet too insecure for any company's trade secrets (which, apparently, have the same weight as national security).[1]: https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-11277-2024-...replydelusional 58 minutes ago

Officials will still be subject to the law when interacting with anybody else. They will still be subject when interacting on public services.

This thread is going to be 400 comments of people talking about how stupid this is, how it won't work and never will, how no sane person could possibly want this. And you know what, I agree with all of that.But there are a few people asking who is pushing for this legislation so hard. That's mostly police forces who are pointing out that they're unable to track the activities of criminal organisations. For example, in the UK sophisticated gangs steal cars and phones and ship them around the world where they're resold. They locate a buyer anywhere in the world who requests a specific car, find that car, steal it and have it in a shipping container within 24 hours. It's impossible to know who's done it, or track any of the communications involved.In previous eras it wasn't possible to create international criminal organisations of this level of sophistication because it was harder to communicate securely. Now it's possible and we all pay the price of increased criminal activity. Everyone's insurance premiums go up, making everyone poorer. UK car insurance premiums are up 82% between 2021 and 2024 and insurance providers are still making a loss.Just to drive this point home - watch/rewatch The Wire (2002-08), except make it impossible to tap the communications of the drug gangs because they're all using encrypted messengers with disappearing messages. Immediately the people running the organisation become untouchable. The police likely can't even figure out who the lieutenants are, let alone the kingpin. At best you can arrest a few street level dealers and that hardly disrupts the criminals at all.On HN everyone is going to say "everyone has a right to private communication, even criminal empires". And sure, I'm not going to disagree. I'm merely pointing out that private communication allows criminal networks to be much larger, more effective and harder to disrupt. And all of society pays the price when we're victimised by criminals.Edit: I'm not saying breaking encryption is a good thing or that it will work, I'm only pointing out why police forces want access to communication records. They're unable to do their jobs and are being blamed for the rise in crime. To prove that you've actually read my comment till the end, please mention banana in your comment.replyasyx 1 hour ago

This is true of course but the counter argument is that running your own infrastructure is probably not a problem for international criminal gangs but your group chat with the boys is not gunna go through some AI garbage filter and in the end we are still going to get our cars stolen but now the police is knocking because I called Merz a fascist bastard and once the actual fascist win an election they are going to knock on everybody’s door who called Weidel a pick me girl in Turkish.In summary, without stupid jokes about German politics, the actual stated goal is unachievable but the real world consequences in a Europe that is sprinting to the far right are incredibly dangerous.replynickslaughter02 1 hour ago

The replies to this thread cannot be serious, on a web forum populated—I thought—primarily by technologists.
Surely you all remember the variations on, "If you make encryption illegal then only criminals will have encryption"?The next step will surely be to make use of communication programs that law enforcement cannot read illegal, right?
The police find some person who has committed a crime, caught in the ways that criminals are usually caught, such as with forensics, or simply with the guns and drugs in the boot of their car.
Then they can see what forms of communication this person was using, and who was using it with them.
At that point, it doesn't matter what those other people were doing: The use of banned encryption technology is the crime.
You can roll them up for that, or use evidence of this crime to justify further intrusion into their meatspace lives.
And so it goes, on up the chain of a criminal organization.
Theoretically, at least.I don't like this, I don't support this, but as has been said elsewhere in this thread: Let's not pretend this is some insurmountable problem for a government who has already shown an appetite for surveillance.replymtlmtlmtlmtl 57 minutes ago

Sure, you could make unauthorized, fully encrypted communication illegal. But what would be the punishment for using it? Worse than for smuggling, human trafficking, murder? I seriously doubt it. If you're a criminal risking decades in prison for major crimes, using some illegal software is 100% worth it, if it significantly reduces the risk of getting caught for the real crimes you're committing.You can't make laws that govern how criminals behave.

In which case it's probably more productive to raze it to the ground and build it anew than to try to fix it. Especially if your idea of "fix it" involves "give them power to breach chat privacy of every citizen".A randomly initialized police force would outperform the baseline of "sorry, we somehow can't stop criminals from stealing those huge, serialized cars, and shipping them out of our extremely isolated island country - now give us more privacy breaching powers!"Even if you gave them those privacy breaching powers? They'll just use them to jail more people for things they said on Twitter.replyonetimeusename 37 minutes ago

You can still do surveillance in the same way that east germany used to.Get a warrant, put hidden microphones and cameras into their light switches and ceiling lights.Turn one of their members into a double agent and get them to spy for you.Of course that's not as easy as total surveillance.

It's bigger than criminality. These are decontextualizing, mythologizing technologies that mimic human thought yet have zero relationship to human thought. None of this should be private, it's a ticking bomb od arbitrariness that the developers lack insight into all scales of the tech: input (which is what they lack insight into the most), the input's subjective/materialist/individualization of all attributes, its impregnation with Western intentions, the dark matter of language: status (each word was created FOR status gain at inception), control (each word was probably created to control), manipulation (each word has the ability to manipulate).
Add to all of the above the notion that every word is an arbitrary metaphor, and notice that every basic condition of words downstream of BC Greece that impregnates our languages are totally unknown to the developers, you can see how Chat is appalling technology.The whole of AI lacks awareness of the dark matter of language seamlessly and hidden within it: it can't be trained out, we use it for these dark matter purposes everyday, and have little or any idea we are using words for subversion, and the tech lacks any and all ability to filter this out and worse, it spirals into "hallucinations" (a terrible metaphor) from the dark matter, not from the apparent words.

Wow, no mentions of banana.I'm bit more sympathetic to this type of argument than most of HN. Looking at what happens in The Wire, you need a judge to allow the wiretap, right? It's not just a willy-nilly cops-can-see-anything system, right? Though it has happened from time to time that since stuff is digital, people have taken a peek when they weren't supposed to. For instance, there was a case over the summer where someone was looking up people in the Danish CPR database, unauthorized.But I also think this won't be the same as wiretapping. That was based on an old telephone system that was very much tied to the technology of that time. In particular, it wasn't encrypted, being just a straight up analog circuit. The bad guys couldn't do much other than use code words, or security by obscurity.With digital, anyone can encrypt, and the cost of decryption is super high. I'm not sure what Snowden said about it, but I think it's fair to say that very few messages could be decrypted.So what will happen? We will all send our decrypted chat messages to the man, and the bad guys will just write their own chat app, which will be encrypted. Nothing illegal will ever happen on the public channels, which from time to time will have some idiot looking at his ex-girlfriend's messages, while the drug lords just write encrypted messages that probably aren't even recognized as chat text.replynzeid 1 hour ago

Why bother tracking just the cars? Just track every person. When you're born some government agent can implant a tracker in your sphincter. When a car is stolen, they arrest everyone in the area where the crime occurred and then sort it out downtown.If you've got nothing to hide, then you shouldn't object to having a sphincter implant to track your every movement. And if you happen to be in an area during a crime, you'll certainly be vindicated, so just a little inconvenience in order to ensure that no car will ever be stolen again.And just think how environmentally friendly that'll be.

I am perfectly OK with the current level of crime and the current level of freedom. In fact, I'd be OK with slightly more crime in exchange for more freedom. Truth is the police often don't even act on the crimes that are provable using good old-fashioned detective work. So they have no leg to stand on.In fact, freedom to break the law, revolt and even kill people is necessary for a functioning democracy. The fourth box of freedom is the final check and balance. If enough people (over half the population) determine that the government is corrupt, they need to be able to overthrow it.And that required and armed population and the ability to organize. Yes, this also helps criminals. Yes, sometimes innocent people will die because the wrong people also have access to guns. That's all the more reason to be able to fight back, both against bad people and against the government.History repeats itself (with minor variations). People don't value their freedoms, let them be eroded by those who are attracted to power for power's sake, they get abused, and finally either they get fed up and start a revolution or the state functions so poorly it gets invaded.We're at the stage where freedoms are getting eroded more and more noticeably.

They have evil intentions, but they are also idiots. The nature of an authoritarian government is one that requires maximizing control for survival. As a particular country shifts to a more authoritarian government, and those people who enabled dumb ideas fall out of power (right, left, or whatever) those same tools will be used by their political adversaries to control, imprison, or kill them.Why are they idiots? Because western Europe is not yet authoritarian and thus there is little personal benefit to hasten a slide towards it, there are so many other ways to gain power in a free society. (I wouldn't bet money that Europe will remain free in 25 years.)There is a secondary problem here -- anything that decreases the information security of European countries hands more power to the US and China (and to a lesser degree other nations with advanced infosec capabilities like Russia and Israel.)

The proximate goal they're trying to achieve is mostly irrelevant when compared to the broader technical goal. That goal is to force all messaging systems to re-architect so they include a "bump on the wire" that hosts a scanning mechanism sophisticated enough to recognize novel (unknown) image content. This implicitly requires re-architecting these systems to contain neural-network image classifiers that operate over a model that's kept secret (to the user/client.) Everything else is sort of irrelevant compared to the implications of this new architecture.The "good news" for now is that the systems deployed in this model won't classify text, only images and URLs. The bad news is that the current draft explicitly allows that question to be reviewed in the future. And of course, once you've re-architected every E2EE system to make image scanning possible, most of the damage to cybersecurity is likely already done; a year or two down the road, text scanning will probably be viewed as a modest and common-sense upgrade. I expect that folks who object to text scanning on cybersecurity grounds will be informed that the risks are already "baked in" to the image-scanning model, and so there's no real harm in adding text scanning.Leaving aside the privacy issues, this is basically an existential national security risk for Europe.

If the message is flagged, it can be sent over an encrypted HTTPS channel to authorities, on a secondary separate connection. At no point, did it leave the device, in unencrypted form.Is that message encrypted? Yes.The way that you want?

And even the government's definition can be argued, because the adversary is defined by the sender and the receiver, not by anyone else.When there is law, then the definition matters and there is legal stand, but before that, it is just an initiative which tries to mislead.replyzappb 1 hour ago

My above example is end to end encryption compatible, it's just that you don't get to pick the end it might go to. However, the connections between ends are still encrypted. As such, it passes the technical mathematical definition (one end having a direct pipe to the second end, with nothing possibly in between), but not the philosophical one.Governments have never cared about the encryption philosophy; only the math aspects and international risk - which, in this example, are technically satisfied.replyTerr_ 2 hours ago

It is perfectly possible to encrypt a message such that two different keys can decrypt it.
There is nothing in modern encryption that makes that impossible.
See https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~aboldyre/papers/bbks.pdf and many others.So your chat app encrypts your message with the recipient's public key and the state's public key.Hey presto, you have a message which cannot be read by someone who casually intercepts it. If the state seizes your message - or records it for later analysis - they do not need to break encryption. There's no plain-text version laying around for anyone to sniff.Is this a good idea? No. Even ignoring the civil liberties aspect, we know that key management is extremely difficult.

The govt key decrypts everything, real-time and stored/archived, sent in that nation during the time it is in use, and that key is in use in multiple places/machines, and is in an org that is a high-profile target for many other reasons (so could likely be exposed in a crack that initially had other purposes.In contrast, a person's key can decrypt only that person's messages, is used only in one place (usermset of machines), and is a generally low-value target.Insanely huge difference between losing a person's key vs the key to an entire nation's communications, even if it is the key of the nation's president -- still far lower value & consequences (start with: if you have the nation's key you can decrypt the president's comms anyway).replythaumasiotes 45 minutes ago

> It is perfectly possible to encrypt a message such that two different keys can decrypt it. There is nothing in modern encryption that makes that impossible.Not really, any more than it's possible to write a message that says the same thing whether you read it in English or Swahili. You might be able to do it once as a novelty, but the approach won't generalize.There are multiple-recipient schemes, but they don't rely on using two different keys to decrypt the same message. Instead, you encrypt the message (once) using a (single) symmetric key, and you prepend a bunch of different messages saying "the symmetric key is xxxxxxxxxxx", one for each intended recipient. Those are encrypted with keys specific to each recipient, and each recipient has to attempt to decrypt them all and select the one that decrypted successfully.The paper you link appears to be discussing an entirely different problem: its definition of a "multi-recipient encryption scheme" does not contemplate sending the same message to several different recipients:> There are n receivers, numbered 1, ..., n. Each receiver i has generated for itself a secret decryption key sk_i and corresponding public encryption key pk_i. The sender now applies a multi-recipient encryption algorithm to pk_1, ..., pk_n and messages M_1, ..., M_n to obtain ciphertexts C_1, ..., C_n.> Each receiver i can apply to sk_i and C_i a decryption algorithm that recovers M_i.> We refer to the primitive enabling this type of encryption as a multi-recipient encryption scheme (MRES).Note that there is no requirement for anyone other than recipient i to be able to understand message M_i. As described, all encryption schemes are multi-recipient encryption schemes, because you can just consider each message M_k individually and encrypt it to recipient k using a single-recipient scheme.replyThouYS 50 minutes ago

If you don't check ID before giving it to a child, that's a crime, and I expect you to be prosecuted, yes.Actually the California bill seems absurdly weak, and it seems to be enough to just ask if they're 18.The Washington bill is stupid for restricting creatine supplements, which the evidence indicates provides physical and cognitive benefits with no real drawbacks. It's the one muscle building supplement that's actually known to work, and should be excluded like protein powder.

Not often mentioned but violence is the greatest enemy of people in power.They always say stuff like "violence doesn't belong in politics", "violence is always wrong". But look at the French revolution, they had to cut the dictator's ("king's") head off to stop him from trying to get back into power. Look at the US for for independence, how many redcoats had to get shot before the UK decided it's not longer economical to keep oppressing the colony. Look at the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich, a public execution of a mass murderer.And for now we're allowed to celebrate those events. Some are even national holidays. But we can not publicly discuss current events in the same manner. Those supporting recent assassinations or attempts usually get banned and many don't even dare voice their support. But there is some line where the fourth box of liberty _should_ come out. And I don't think we have enough freedom of speech currently to discuss where exactly the line lies. (Note to mods, I don't have an opinion on the recent shooting and this message is not related to it. I would have posted the exact same thing even if it didn't happen and have posted similar messages in the past.)BTW this is funny: Brandon Herrera posted a video reconstructing the headshot by Gary Plauché where it's obvious both him and the commenters support the killing. He also reconstructed the, well, earshot by Thomas Matthew Crooks and denounced it. I wonder if he would support an assassination if it turned out Trump got, say, a massage with a happy ending from an underage girl trafficked by his friend. That would imply being a pedophile is worse than being a fascist[0] in his mind.[0]: https://acoup.blog/2024/10/25/new-acquisitions-1933-and-the-...---Anyway, violence should be used carefully as a last resort but people in power are afraid of it because ultimately, no matter how much power they have, they still need a continuous supply of oxygen to their brain, which can be interrupted in a number of ways and the probability of such an event increases proportionally to the number of people they exploit.replyJ_Shelby_J 2 hours ago
