In the past, we could have made a version of Signal without this spyware, to be installed as an APK (as I would expect the EU to force Google to ban the non-spying version from the app store).

Pretty neat how, out of the blue, two seemingly unrelated efforts manage to tighten together to create the perfect unavoidable storm.I swear those Thursday bilderberg meetings are a thing.replyglenstein 1 hour ago

The thing that depresses me about offhand references to bilderberg group is it's a missed chance to name real names. I don't know who they are, but from chat gpt'ing it looks like there's some particular agencies regularly behind these. One is "DG Home," an EU department on security that drafts legislation.Another is Europol, a security coordination body that can't legislate but frequently advocates for this kind of legislation.And then there's LEWP, The law enforcement working party, a "working group" comprised of security officials from member EU states, also involved in EU policy making in some capacity.Perhaps targeted reform of these bodies is in order so they don't keep producing this legislation over and over. The blocking minority shouldn't just oppose the legislation itself, but make sure that their representation at those bodies is stopping those recommendations from moving forward. The legislating infrastructure needs to be challenged as much as any particular bill.replyvarispeed 1 hour ago

Thank you.For others this is the last para of the first link:> The Swedish government has proposed new legislation that would allow police to wiretap children under the age of 15 in an attempt to curb the violence, according to the BBC.So, Chat Control is an attempt by a few politicians to give police some tools to prevent teenagers from shooting each other in gang wars.
It's a real problem, it needs a real solution, this looks to be an honest attempt to come up with one - from someone who doesn't know what they are doing.Interestingly, we've had an uptick in youth violence here in Australia too.
It feels eerily similar.
It's happening in the same demographic, it's happening while crime overall is dropping, and the authorities here too are struggling to control it.
It's so serious it lead to a change of government at the last election.
A right wing mob got in by beating the law and order drum with the slogan "Adult Crime, Adult Time".

I live in sweden. Police here is extremely incompetent and unwilling to do their jobs.They will not seriously investigate any white collar crime, so corruption is completely unpunished.They focus on gangs and so on, or so they say. What they actually do is aggressively target non violent people who smoke weed and occasionally some small fish dealer. Remember that owning any amount (even trace amounts only detectable by a chemist) of THC is a crime. Yes they do spend resources to go after people who occasionally smoke weed.Meanwhile if you're a 2nd generation immigrant you will be forever subject to daily discrimination, and getting a job that is not hemtjänst or cleaning is going to be very rare.replynickslaughter02 2 hours ago

The nazis had income tax rates virtually identical to most modern European countries, which was not at all common globally at the time.Also they had wealth exit taxes just like modern Socialists in Europe are fighting for right now: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reich_Flight_TaxI've now listed about 10 different major similarities, but if you'd like I can go on with more similarities.Modern socialists in Europe are also starting to turn against immigration and toward ethnic nationalism as well.This is a fundamental dark truth about socialism; it leads to anti-immigrant backlash. When the collective is paying for a lot of social welfare, they tend to get upset when people they perceive as 'other' come in and start to enjoy the fruits of the collective pie.You can 1:1 map the increasingly closed immigration policy in the US with the rise of the social welfare state starting in the 1930s.replyslater 1 hour ago

If you think there's a hard definition of socialism that Hitler clearly falls outside of, I'm pretty sure you're wrong. They blamed rich people for all the ills of society (Jewish people for them); they believed in the state running the economy through "corporatism"; they believed in a disarmed population that relies on the state for planning and protection; and they were willing to sacrifice millions of their populace to get there.

>(12a) In the light of the more limited risk of their use for the purpose of child sexual abuse and the need to preserve confidential information, including classified information, information covered by professional secrecy and trade secrets, electronic communications services that are not publicly available, such as those used for national security purposes, should be excluded from the scope of this Regulation. Accordingly, this Regulation should not apply to interpersonal communications services that are not available to the general public and the use of which is instead restricted to persons involved in the activities of a particular company, organisation, body or authority.From document 11277/24 [1].
Unless it has changed more recently, the exemption is actually considerably broader, and presents the unusual argument that the system will be secure enough for any private personal communications, yet too insecure for any company's trade secrets (which, apparently, have the same weight as national security).[1]: https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-11277-2024-...replyHizonner 45 minutes ago

This thread is going to be 400 comments of people talking about how stupid this is, how it won't work and never will, how no sane person could possibly want this. And you know what, I agree with all of that.But there are a few people asking who is pushing for this legislation so hard. That's mostly police forces who are pointing out that they're unable to track the activities of criminal organisations. For example, in the UK sophisticated gangs steal cars and phones and ship them around the world where they're resold. They locate a buyer anywhere in the world who requests a specific car, find that car, steal it and have it in a shipping container within 24 hours. It's impossible to know who's done it, or track any of the communications involved.In previous eras it wasn't possible to create international criminal organisations of this level of sophistication because it was harder to communicate securely. Now it's possible and we all pay the price of increased criminal activity. Everyone's insurance premiums go up, making everyone poorer. UK car insurance premiums are up 82% between 2021 and 2024 and insurance providers are still making a loss.Just to drive this point home - watch/rewatch The Wire (2002-08), except make it impossible to tap the communications of the drug gangs because they're all using encrypted messengers with disappearing messages. Immediately the people running the organisation become untouchable. The police likely can't even figure out who the lieutenants are, let alone the kingpin. At best you can arrest a few street level dealers and that hardly disrupts the criminals at all.On HN everyone is going to say "everyone has a right to private communication, even criminal empires". And sure, I'm not going to disagree. I'm merely pointing out that private communication allows criminal networks to be much larger, more effective and harder to disrupt. And all of society pays the price when we're victimised by criminals.Edit: I'm not saying breaking encryption is a good thing or that it will work, I'm only pointing out why police forces want access to communication records. They're unable to do their jobs and are being blamed for the rise in crime. To prove that you've actually read my comment till the end, please mention banana in your comment.replyasyx 2 hours ago

It is not possible to declare and import a container into the U.K. within a 24 hour time-frame, so why is it possible to export that quickly?---It is because there is already robust and mature set of controls for imports into the country for drugs, weapons, agriculture/wildlife, food safety or tariff and any number of other reasons, which do mostly work.Export controls on the other hand unfortunately are very weak or don't exist at all in most geographies.Businesses do not want export(or import) friction, so governments find it easier to pass laws and implement policies like monitoring when the alternative is add more friction to non service businesses where job losses grab headlines i.e when a factory shuts down or lays off people it is front page news.---This is also why industries from richer countries so easily are able to dump anything from toxic to bio or plastic and radioactive waste in poorer countries without any scrutiny whatsoever.It is combination of weak export + weak controls in poorer countries makes it easy to get rid off problematic material. Governments are well aware of this, yet will not implement export controls because their votes care about waste disposal only in their country, and business want do it cheaply.---It is certainly possible and doable to control exported asset theft, the question is how much job losses can the government stomach versus loss of support due to diluting right to privacy. It is no different for environmental or worker safety or noise any other regulations.---This entire tradeoff argument presupposes that monitoring will actually help in reducing organized theft, which is unlikely.As long as browsers continue be allowed on a phone, you cannot control what "applications" actually people use, anyone with enough motivation will switch to web applications on the browser fairly simply. With PWA features it looks like an "app" too.Gangs will not just give up when native apps are monitored, they will find alternative means of communication.After all this is their main business, some friction is not enough to stop them, it is not like say downloading a song, making it more easy to do so legally changes user behavior. $10/month versus loosing your primary income.Without robust export controls, only adding pervasive monitoring is just wasted even when privacy rights not a decision factor.replyFateOfNations 42 minutes ago

The replies to this thread cannot be serious, on a web forum populated—I thought—primarily by technologists.
Surely you all remember the variations on, "If you make encryption illegal then only criminals will have encryption"?The next step will surely be to make use of communication programs that law enforcement cannot read illegal, right?
The police find some person who has committed a crime, caught in the ways that criminals are usually caught, such as with forensics, or simply with the guns and drugs in the boot of their car.
Then they can see what forms of communication this person was using, and who was using it with them.
At that point, it doesn't matter what those other people were doing: The use of banned encryption technology is the crime.
You can roll them up for that, or use evidence of this crime to justify further intrusion into their meatspace lives.
And so it goes, on up the chain of a criminal organization.
Theoretically, at least.I don't like this, I don't support this, but as has been said elsewhere in this thread: Let's not pretend this is some insurmountable problem for a government who has already shown an appetite for surveillance.replymtlmtlmtlmtl 1 hour ago

Sure, you could make unauthorized, fully encrypted communication illegal. But what would be the punishment for using it? Worse than for smuggling, human trafficking, murder? I seriously doubt it. If you're a criminal risking decades in prison for major crimes, using some illegal software is 100% worth it, if it significantly reduces the risk of getting caught for the real crimes you're committing.You can't make laws that govern how criminals behave. All chat control will really accomplish is maybe a momentary string of arrests(which is meaningless in the long term; there's always someone to take over), and longer term, worse privacy and security for everyone except the criminals.replybaxtr 2 hours ago

Once Season 3 is over everything about how burners were surveilled is then public record, so criminal gangs switch up once more, making it even harder.Now if you made a show with all the criminals using encrypted, disappearing messages - that would be basically unbreakable.

It's bigger than criminality. These are decontextualizing, mythologizing technologies that mimic human thought yet have zero relationship to human thought. None of this should be private, it's a ticking bomb od arbitrariness that the developers lack insight into all scales of the tech: input (which is what they lack insight into the most), the input's subjective/materialist/individualization of all attributes, its impregnation with Western intentions, the dark matter of language: status (each word was created FOR status gain at inception), control (each word was probably created to control), manipulation (each word has the ability to manipulate).
Add to all of the above the notion that every word is an arbitrary metaphor, and notice that every basic condition of words downstream of BC Greece that impregnates our languages are totally unknown to the developers, you can see how Chat is appalling technology.The whole of AI lacks awareness of the dark matter of language seamlessly and hidden within it: it can't be trained out, we use it for these dark matter purposes everyday, and have little or any idea we are using words for subversion, and the tech lacks any and all ability to filter this out and worse, it spirals into "hallucinations" (a terrible metaphor) from the dark matter, not from the apparent words.

Wow, no mentions of banana.I'm bit more sympathetic to this type of argument than most of HN. Looking at what happens in The Wire, you need a judge to allow the wiretap, right? It's not just a willy-nilly cops-can-see-anything system, right? Though it has happened from time to time that since stuff is digital, people have taken a peek when they weren't supposed to. For instance, there was a case over the summer where someone was looking up people in the Danish CPR database, unauthorized.But I also think this won't be the same as wiretapping. That was based on an old telephone system that was very much tied to the technology of that time. In particular, it wasn't encrypted, being just a straight up analog circuit. The bad guys couldn't do much other than use code words, or security by obscurity.With digital, anyone can encrypt, and the cost of decryption is super high. I'm not sure what Snowden said about it, but I think it's fair to say that very few messages could be decrypted.So what will happen? We will all send our decrypted chat messages to the man, and the bad guys will just write their own chat app, which will be encrypted. Nothing illegal will ever happen on the public channels, which from time to time will have some idiot looking at his ex-girlfriend's messages, while the drug lords just write encrypted messages that probably aren't even recognized as chat text.replytestdelacc1 1 hour ago

I am perfectly OK with the current level of crime and the current level of freedom. In fact, I'd be OK with slightly more crime in exchange for more freedom. Truth is the police often don't even act on the crimes that are provable using good old-fashioned detective work. So they have no leg to stand on.In fact, freedom to break the law, revolt and even kill people is necessary for a functioning democracy. The fourth box of freedom is the final check and balance. If enough people (over half the population) determine that the government is corrupt, they need to be able to overthrow it.And that required and armed population and the ability to organize. Yes, this also helps criminals. Yes, sometimes innocent people will die because the wrong people also have access to guns. That's all the more reason to be able to fight back, both against bad people and against the government.History repeats itself (with minor variations). People don't value their freedoms, let them be eroded by those who are attracted to power for power's sake, they get abused, and finally either they get fed up and start a revolution or the state functions so poorly it gets invaded.We're at the stage where freedoms are getting eroded more and more noticeably.

I agree with you (i.e., I share your belief that the whole "safety" argument is a bold-faced excuse to just gain more control and surveillance power over the population), but I believe that the parent comment was just trying to be extra charitable to those pushing for the bill.I think it is fair to give the opponent's position (which both you and I believe is in the wrong) a steel-man argument treatment, by assuming the best possible interpretation of their argument (even if they don't imo deserve it, and you don't believe in their stated intent).The approach makes sense to me, as attacking and debating genuineness of someone's intentions is an endless rabbithole. So if you have an option to decimate their case, all while assuming their stated intent to be truthful and genuine, that's a pretty solid way to actually move the needle on the argument in a desired direction.replycodeptualize 28 minutes ago

They have evil intentions, but they are also idiots. The nature of an authoritarian government is one that requires maximizing control for survival. As a particular country shifts to a more authoritarian government, and those people who enabled dumb ideas fall out of power (right, left, or whatever) those same tools will be used by their political adversaries to control, imprison, or kill them.Why are they idiots? Because western Europe is not yet authoritarian and thus there is little personal benefit to hasten a slide towards it, there are so many other ways to gain power in a free society. (I wouldn't bet money that Europe will remain free in 25 years.)There is a secondary problem here -- anything that decreases the information security of European countries hands more power to the US and China (and to a lesser degree other nations with advanced infosec capabilities like Russia and Israel.) If you are European (I'm not) the first thing that should be done is investigate the people pushing this stuff.replysoftwaredoug 1 hour ago

The proximate goal they're trying to achieve is mostly irrelevant when compared to the broader technical goal. That goal is to force all messaging systems to re-architect so they include a "bump on the wire" that hosts a scanning mechanism sophisticated enough to recognize novel (unknown) image content. This implicitly requires re-architecting these systems to contain neural-network image classifiers that operate over a model that's kept secret (to the user/client.) Everything else is sort of irrelevant compared to the implications of this new architecture.The "good news" for now is that the systems deployed in this model won't classify text, only images and URLs. The bad news is that the current draft explicitly allows that question to be reviewed in the future. And of course, once you've re-architected every E2EE system to make image scanning possible, most of the damage to cybersecurity is likely already done; a year or two down the road, text scanning will probably be viewed as a modest and common-sense upgrade. I expect that folks who object to text scanning on cybersecurity grounds will be informed that the risks are already "baked in" to the image-scanning model, and so there's no real harm in adding text scanning.Leaving aside the privacy issues, this is basically an existential national security risk for Europe.

It is perfectly possible to encrypt a message such that two different keys can decrypt it.
There is nothing in modern encryption that makes that impossible.
See https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~aboldyre/papers/bbks.pdf and many others.So your chat app encrypts your message with the recipient's public key and the state's public key.Hey presto, you have a message which cannot be read by someone who casually intercepts it. If the state seizes your message - or records it for later analysis - they do not need to break encryption. There's no plain-text version laying around for anyone to sniff.Is this a good idea?

> It is perfectly possible to encrypt a message such that two different keys can decrypt it. There is nothing in modern encryption that makes that impossible.Not really, any more than it's possible to write a message that says the same thing whether you read it in English or Swahili. You might be able to do it once as a novelty, but the approach won't generalize.There are multiple-recipient schemes, but they don't rely on using two different keys to decrypt the same message. Instead, you encrypt the message (once) using a (single) symmetric key, and you prepend a bunch of different messages saying "the symmetric key is xxxxxxxxxxx", one for each intended recipient. Those are encrypted with keys specific to each recipient, and each recipient has to attempt to decrypt them all and select the one that decrypted successfully.The paper you link appears to be discussing an entirely different problem: its definition of a "multi-recipient encryption scheme" does not contemplate sending the same message to several different recipients:> There are n receivers, numbered 1, ..., n. Each receiver i has generated for itself a secret decryption key sk_i and corresponding public encryption key pk_i. The sender now applies a multi-recipient encryption algorithm to pk_1, ..., pk_n and messages M_1, ..., M_n to obtain ciphertexts C_1, ..., C_n.> Each receiver i can apply to sk_i and C_i a decryption algorithm that recovers M_i.> We refer to the primitive enabling this type of encryption as a multi-recipient encryption scheme (MRES).Note that there is no requirement for anyone other than recipient i to be able to understand message M_i. As described, all encryption schemes are multi-recipient encryption schemes, because you can just consider each message M_k individually and encrypt it to recipient k using a single-recipient scheme.replyThouYS 1 hour ago

Not often mentioned but violence is the greatest enemy of people in power.They always say stuff like "violence doesn't belong in politics", "violence is always wrong".

Look at the US for for independence, how many redcoats had to get shot before the UK decided it's not longer economical to keep oppressing the colony. Look at the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich, a public execution of a mass murderer.And for now we're allowed to celebrate those events. Some are even national holidays. But we can not publicly discuss current events in the same manner. Those supporting recent assassinations or attempts usually get banned and many don't even dare voice their support. But there is some line where the fourth box of liberty _should_ come out. And I don't think we have enough freedom of speech currently to discuss where exactly the line lies.

I think that decentralized solutions to the Web mostly suck because they're worse to use for the majority of people. But if the Web becomes useless for things people actually care about, decentralized solutions will creep in. People won't simply give up, the things that work will become better in the ways that serve prospective users.That's kind of the worst case scenario, though, where bad politicians don't get removed from office. We can hope that most people will decide that enough is enough, or politicians will quietly back down when they realize they're dooming their own careers.replylayer8 2 hours ago

The worst case is when only approved hardware and software will be legal, and every level of infrastructure will be enforcing that. You can say good bye to decentralized solutions then.Note how Apple is already a bit like that, banning certain torrenting apps even from alternative app stores [0]. I’m just mentioning that as a demonstration of the feasibility of such closed and controlled ecosystems. Now restrict ISP network traffic to packets signed by approved hardware, and there aren’t that many practical loopholes left.[0] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45098411replybitwize 34 minutes ago

Brazil's senate has already approved a bill, PL 2628, which is broadly similar to the UK's Online Safety Act, but also requires sistemas operacionais de terminais ("terminal operating systems") to implement age checks in a secure, auditable fashion.The days where you could run whatever OS you want on hardware you own will soon be over.

Does it? Some parts of the world have revolutions every other week and are still jot as good as anything we have in the west despite our massive flawshttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepalese_revolutionreplymartin-t 1 hour ago

Revolution simply rolls the dice again. In states which used to have functional institutions and the organizational memory is still present, they can lead to good outcomes. In states which never had them, they cannot be created out of thin air.A historian called Sarah Paine explained this nicely with examples of how the occupation of Afghanistan failed to create democracy but the occupation of post-WW2 Germany succeeded because Germany used to have a democracy whereas Afghanistan never did.replylogicchains 1 hour ago

IMO, the endgame is tyranny that we cannot escape. Something like stasi on hi-tech steroids. Such a tyranny can only be possible if there are no places on earth we can escape to and if domestic survelliance is so comprehensive that potential threats are eliminated before those threats realise what they are up to. In such a state, when there is neither external no internal pressure, the tyrant can rule for centuries. The thing is, there is a nontrivial number of those among us who prefer this way of life, and they are very capable in achieving their goals.replyisaacremuant 2 hours ago

The goal is always to suppress the ability to dissent political.It was trialed during covid and people absolutely cheered for this type of control.Now it's only a matter of time unless people accept that it's never acceptable. Not even with "perceived threats". Covid passes and social scores to do activities where absolutely a wet dream for govs and corporations alike.
The corporations that benefit from government mandated tools love getting free money and governments love control. They know the tools never spy on them, and that's why everytime they're the ones committing crimes or ignoring their rules it's "a mistake or nothing to see here".replyjMyles 3 hours ago

The realistic outcome, most likely, is mDL (mobile driver's license) automatically being passed through from your OS, to your browser, to the website.

From the second link:> The privacy considerations for digital credentials are not static. They will evolve over time as the ecosystem matures, and may be informed by the behavior of other actors in the ecosystem, improvements in other layers of the stack, new threats to user privacy, as well as changing societal norms and regulations.Boil the frog slowly and carefully, and look out for opportune moments that could help to speed up the process.replykoolala 2 hours ago

Nordic cultures are actually substantially different.Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Icelandic and Finnish culture is vastly different. If we include the Dutch or the Estonians the differences become even bigger.As a Swede I'm not afraid of my neighbours seeing into my apartment, because I have order there and I don't see any harm in them seeing into it, and you can of course interpret this as some kind of 'if you have nothing to hide you have nothing to fear', but it's more that I don't see a need for physical privacy. Letters are completely different matter and in others I am intensely secretive, but you can't learn anything I want to keep from you from looking at my houseplants.If I had disorder in my kitchen and people could see into it I would be very unhappy.replyCalRobert 2 hours ago
