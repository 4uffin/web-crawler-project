I want this sizebox widget flexible. Error rendering SizedBox, I tried Expanded, Flex, ad Flexible. Having problem with Parent Tree Structure. Currently SizedBox has fixed size. But this is a mobile responsive website. SizedBox should vary size. You can change the entire structure of widgets if required.
child: Column(
mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
children: [
//some widgets
Padding(
padding: const EdgeInsets.only(right: 30.0, left: 30.0),
child: SizedBox(
height: 50,
child: TabBar(
controller: _tabController1,
labelColor: Colors.blue,
unselectedLabelColor: Colors.lightBlue,
indicatorColor: Colors.redAccent,
tabs: [Tab(text: "Flutter")],
),
),
),
Padding(
padding: const EdgeInsets.only(right: 30.0, left: 30.0),
//This SizedBox
child: SizedBox(
height: 600,
child: TabBarView(
controller: _tabController1,
children: [
Column(
children: [
Padding(
padding: const EdgeInsets.only(
top: 10.0,
right: 30.0,
left: 30.0,
bottom: 10.0,
),
child: Text(
ArticlesConstants.articlesConstants2,
maxLines: 100,
style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.bodyMedium,

),
Align(

maxLines: 100,

?.copyWith(

For this code no error, but minimize the sizedbox size from 600 or use double.infininty with esxpaded parent widget then no height defined error
and screen goes blank

@GOKU, why don't you provide a screenshot and a description of the problem you're facing, and what you want to achieve?

To allow the content to fit the screen automatically, do not use SizedBox(height: 600) – because this sets the height to 600 pixels on every screen, regardless of whether it’s small or large.
Instead, let the content take the available space on the screen using Expanded. Also, use SingleChildScrollView to allow scrolling when the content overflows on smaller screens.
It's should be like this:
LayoutBuilder(
builder: (context, constraints) {
return Column(
mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
children: [
Padding(
padding: const EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 30.0),
child: SizedBox(
height: 50,
child: TabBar(
controller: _tabController1,
labelColor: Colors.blue,
unselectedLabelColor: Colors.lightBlue,
indicatorColor: Colors.redAccent,
tabs: [Tab(text: "Flutter")],
),
),
),
Expanded(
child: Padding(
padding: const EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 30.0),
child: TabBarView(
controller: _tabController1,
children: [
SingleChildScrollView(
child: Column(
crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,
children: [
Padding(
padding: const EdgeInsets.symmetric(vertical: 10.0),
child: Text(
ArticlesConstants.articlesConstants2,
maxLines: 100,
style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.bodyMedium,
),
),
Text(
"Articles on FLUTTER",
maxLines: 100,
style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.bodyMedium?.copyWith(
fontWeight: FontWeight.w700,
color: Colors.redAccent,
),
),
HyperlinkText(
text: "Tic Tac Toe",
url: "",
choice: "web",
),
HyperlinkText(
text: "Tic Tac Toe: Bot vs Player - Player first move",
url: "",
choice: "web",
),
],
),
),
],
),
),
),
],
);
},
)
