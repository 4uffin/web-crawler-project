What is CNN 10?
Today's Show Transcript
NATASHA CHEN, CNN 10 ANCHOR:
Hello and happy Friday, everyone. I'm Natasha Chen, filling in for Coy from CNN's Los Angeles Bureau.
Hope you're having an awesome day. It is Friday, September 12, and we have a lot of news headlines to tell you about, so let's get right to it.
We begin in Qatar, where Israel's deadly strike on the capital of Doha earlier this week shakes up the possibility of a Gaza ceasefire deal. It was the first time Israel struck inside Qatar, a key American ally that has been instrumental in hosting ceasefire negotiations up to this point.
Israel says the strike, which killed five Hamas members, was targeting the terror group's negotiating delegation. Those officials had been visiting Doha for a while to participate in those ongoing ceasefire talks.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has made it clear that Israel will continue to go after the Hamas leaders responsible for the October 7 terror attacks, whether they're in Gaza or abroad.
But the strike in Doha is not only sending shockwaves through the region. It's also now unclear if a deal can be reached, not just for a ceasefire, but for the release of the remaining hostages being held by Hamas. Qatar's prime minister was meeting with the families the very morning of Israel's attack, and has publicly condemned Netanyahu for it. He spoke exclusively to CNN about the situation.

MOHAMMED BIN ABDULRAHMAN BIN JASSIM AL THANI:
They are counting on this mediation. They have no other hope for that. And I think that what Netanyahu has done yesterday, he just killed any hope for those hostages.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CHEN:
A senior Hamas official tells CNN that, quote, "no one is talking about a ceasefire deal now." Now to the Asian nation of Nepal, where the army has taken control of the streets in the capital city of Kathmandu. A curfew is now being enforced after two days of deadly anti-government protests.
Tens of thousands of people poured into the streets, clashing with government forces sent to control them. Protesters set fire to key government buildings, including parliament and the Supreme Court. And Nepal's prime minister and several cabinet members have resigned in the face of the massive demonstrations.
It's the worst unrest the country has experienced in decades. The country's health ministry says at least 30 people have been killed and thousands have been injured so far.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:
We just wanted to prove a point. We don't want corruption. We don't want this. We don't want them to lead our country. And they just killed people. Like, life doesn't matter to them.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CHEN:
The Gen Z-led demonstrations erupted after the government banned Facebook, WhatsApp and other platforms earlier this month. That was a result of previous anti-corruption protests. One eyewitness stresses that the goal of this movement is much bigger than just social media.
Hundreds of South Korean workers detained by the U.S. government last week have been released. They are scheduled to land in Seoul today after boarding a chartered Korean air jet, which departed Atlanta on Thursday. The workers were taken into custody in a massive immigration raid at a plant in southern Georgia, jointly operated by South Korea-based companies Hyundai and LG Energy Solutions.
Korean officials say President Trump offered to allow the workers to stay in the U.S. to train American workers, but only one person chose to do so. Now, to a major update on a story out of the world of medicine. Scientists are making progress on research to improve the performance of pig organ transplants in humans.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, has given the go-ahead for human trials involving kidneys from pigs that have been genetically modified to be more compatible with human recipients. This is important because there are more than 100,000 people in the U.S. alone waiting for organ donations, and 86% of those on the list need a kidney. The average wait time to get one from a human donor is currently three to five years, but depending on the recipient, it can take as many as 10 years.
Time for 10-second trivia.
Which invasive species is a major problem in Florida swamps?
Burmese pythons, Komodo dragons, anacondas, or rattlesnakes?
The answer here is Burmese pythons. The snakes are not native to Florida and were released into the wild primarily as a result of the exotic pet trade. The pythons have drastically reduced populations of native mammals and other wildlife, significantly impacting the ecosystem.
Burmese pythons aren't the only slithery species invading the Sunshine State. Asian swamp eels have also been spreading throughout Florida's thousands of lakes and waterways in recent years, and as their population grows, so do concerns over the potential impact they could have on local ecosystems. But a team of scientists is employing shockingly unique approach in their quest to capture the critters.
Our Wes Bruer got an up-close and personnel look.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
HOWARD JELKS, (RET.) FISH BIOLOGIST, USGS:
Today we're going after Asian swamp eels. These are long, eel-like fishes that will be up in the rocks and vegetation, and they are introduced in potentially thousands of ecological dumps.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:
So, if you get one of those --
JELKS:
Super snappy. Yep, looks like a snake.
DR. WESLEY DANIEL, FISH BIOLOGIST, USGS:
We first discovered them in the central Florida area in 2023, and since that time we've been identifying additional lakes that have established populations in them. This is a multi-partner effort to do this type of surveillance to get an idea of their current distribution in the area.
We'll go one direction, you go the other. We have a tool called the Flood and Storm Tracker where we look at post-flooding conditions and the potential for movement of non-native species like our Asian swamp eels. There is potential once a population is established in one lake, they can be spread to other lakes through those flood actions.
It gives us an idea of potential spread and consequences, the impacts of these introductions by identifying where populations are and potentially how many are there, and are they recruiting, are they reproducing in those lakes. We produce an electrical field around the boat through an anode and a cathode. So, you saw the boom out in the front, and then we have metal wires that trail behind them.
The electricity comes out of the front of the boom and allow that electrical field around the boat to temporarily stun the fish, allowing us to sample them and release them unharmed. It's a small shock that allows them to come to the surface and allow us to sample them. We are continuing to do research on the swamp eels, looking at some diet studies.
Some of our partners including Florida Wildlife Conservation Commission and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, they're also participating, doing various studies to understand more of the life history of these. And prevention is, you know, not releasing animals that don't belong in the wild, either being a pet or through livelihood.
You got one? Good.

Today's story getting a 10 out of 10. One Lego fanatic is getting the chance of a lifetime watching one of his own creations become a piece of history. Lifelong LEGO fan Alex Sahli has quite the collection. He's conquered sets ranging from log cabins to the Millennium Falcon, but over the years he's moved from building sets to designing them. Alex has dreamed up nearly 50 different creations using an online program, and after years of submissions, one of them was approved.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
ALEX SAHLI, LEGO DESIGNER: So, this is the Italian Riviera. It is almost 3,300 pieces. So, my inspiration for this was a trip I was about to take, and I was all excited. I was doing a bunch of research.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CHEN:
Lego designers helped Alex perfect the set, and it officially hit shelves in August. The seaside scene even features a cameo of its creator.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SAHLI:
So, there's a mini figure right here of me with my camera because I'm always taking pictures.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CHEN:
He says putting it together for the first time was a surreal experience. It's also proof that persistence can pay off even if it's one brick at a time.
All right, superstars, before we head out for the weekend, let's get you a very special Friday shout out. This one goes to Ms. Bargfried's 7th graders and all the students at Eckstein Middle School in Seattle, Washington. I had so much fun with you all today. I hope you did too.
Coy will be back on Monday. Have a great weekend. I'm Natasha Chen, and this is CNN 10.
