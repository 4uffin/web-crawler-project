GettyAll the stars showed up in their best and boldest looks for the 77th Emmy Awards red carpet on Sunday. The show, hosted by stand-up comedian Nate Bargatze, is at the Peacock Theater in downtown Los Angeles. Advertisement
Fortunately for attendees, the biggest concern this year is simply choosing what to wear, instead of bracing for any edgy monologue jokes. Bargatze insists he’s going to keep his signature clean humor, and avoid anything mean-spirited. “I would not want to do something that’s just inherently mean, and to really be mean to a person,” he told CNN on Friday. “That would break my heart if I found out anybody was really hurt by anything.” 20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.
