Known for their plush, “cloudlike” cushion, Hoka models like the Clifton 9 have been previously declared hypeworthy by HuffPost shopping writer Lourdes Avila Uribe. But the Cliftons aren’t the only shoes worth buying from the brand — in fact, my favorite model as a Hoka fan is one that tends to fly a little under the radar. And at $125 a pair, they’re one of the cheapest Hoka sneakers available.$125 at Zappos$125 at NordstromAdvertisement
$100+ at HokaHokaThe Hoka Solimar.First introduced in 2022, the Hoka Solimar is officially my favorite walking shoe — and that’s coming from someone who loves Hokas so much, I once asked for a pair for my birthday. The Solimar has a balanced midsole that’s forgiving, but still firm. The extended crash pad absorbs enough impact that I don’t feel like I’m on a trampoline every time I take a walk (definitely a feeling I got wearing my old beloved Rincon 3s, which are now discontinued).Advertisement
I also appreciate the Solimar’s stack height and thinner design. The support is evident, but the shoes don’t look as bulbous from the top as some of the other Hoka models I’ve tried on before like the Bondi 8, whose cushioning flares out on the sides a bit. It gives the Solimars a sleeker appearance, and combined with their light, 6.7-ounce weight, they don’t feel heavy on my feet. In the neutral white colorway I chose, they don’t scream “exercise shoe,” and don’t look out of place paired with a dress or office-appropriate outfit.The soles are a durable, high-abrasion rubber that can last through daily use and are extra-padded in areas more likely to endure wear. The uppers are made of a breathable, recycled mesh, and the collar and tongue have padding that feels soft without rubbing uncomfortably against my ankles.HokaHoka Solimar sneakerAdvertisement
I’ve put these to the test by taking them out for over 10,000-step walks on a pretty regular basis. They’ve served me well as a Manhattanite, from trekking hundreds of city blocks to even trudging up a hill’s worth of old, rough stairs during a day trip to Governors Island. I’ve never had any soreness or foot pain during or after, which has helped me be more willing and motivated to get my steps in.While the Solimar is technically designed for running and training, according to Hoka, reviewers seem to agree that it’s best suited for everyday wear including walking, and is great for people with plantar fasciitis. Some have purchased multiple pairs — and I’m pretty much certain that when I wear mine through, I’ll be buying a second pair, too.You can grab the women’s Solimar at Zappos, Nordstrom and Hoka in up to 11 colors and sizes 5-11, or the men’s in up to nine colors and sizes 7-14 at Zappos, Nordstrom and Hoka. Both have options for regular and wide sizing. Read on for some happy reviews left by Solimar devotees, and be prepared to want to snag a pair for yourself.Advertisement
“I was hesitant with the hype and hefty price of the Hoka brand of shoes. But, I was in need of some serious comfort and durability, unfound in previous brands of shoes I’ve obliterated while paying way too much. So, I took the leap into a pair of Hoka shoes. The first thing you notice when opening the box for the first time is how LIGHT these shoes are. I’m pretty sure a banana weighs more than both shoes combined! Next, was the blackout color style I wanted. I was not disappointed. Very stylish, without being too “over the top” like some shoes out there. Then, oh yes, the absolute best part: slipping into these shoes for the first time (with my fav socks). It’s like bouncing around on 10 1/2 clouds at once! (11 clouds may be too bouncy) In conclusion, I’ve owned these shoes for about a month now and they are the only shoes I wear. My feet don’t hurt at work, and I’ve somehow managed to double my daily steps. I was skeptical with the price tag, but am not regretting the investment. Thanks Hoka for designing a great shoe. Will be more than happy to write more awesome reviews for future purchases!” — TJ“I have so many friends and family members that love their Hokas!! The first pair I tried were not comfortable for me. A friend let me know about the guarantee that they offer, which was amazing! I then found the Solimar style, which is absolutely perfect for me. I have a narrow foot for the most part, but I deal with longer toes, and occasional pain in my feet from plantar fasciitis and bunions. The Solimar offers a nice long toe bed and still gives me enough support to hold my foot in place along with just enough cushion underneath.” — Nicole“My new Hokas were comfortable from the start! No breaking in was needed. Great cushioning and amazing arch support. The front toe area is slightly more rounded than other brands I’ve had, which allows a comfortable, nonrestricted fit, as well as a great look!” — Terri“I’ve enjoyed walking in the HOKA Solimar shoe for over a year now! I ve worn it out, but always in comfort! My latest adventure was walking my HOKA Solimar shoes on the Great Wall in China! The 3-4 miles of walking on the wall wasn’t even a thought, doing 15-18K steps per day! Thanks HOKA…” — Gerry“Wow! These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever put on my feet. Super lightweight and a dream to walk in. This was a great buy. So good in fact that I have ordered a second pair. Time will tell how long they last but I’ve worn them everyday for the past month and I see no wear whatsoever. Size and fit were perfect.” — Joe$125 at ZapposAdvertisement

For daily wear while chasing grandkids and running errands, she likes the Allbirds Wool Runners (which many people in my family own). "Sooo comfy!" she said. "Made of wool. Breathes, repels moisture and lightweight."Versatile kicks that are great for travel or daily use, they are soft and cozy without getting sweaty but will help keep your piggies warm in the cold.

4ZapposHoka BondiMy very sporty mom, a spritely 61-year-old, loves her Hoka Bondi sneakers. "I get a new pair every year, and this is my third pair," she said. "Good arch support and great walking and running shoe. Feels like I’m walking on a cloud." Hokas are a HuffPost favorite, known for their extreme comfort. The Bondi features a light foam sole, with a slightly extended outer heel to help you feel balanced and provide a little more cushion as you stride. These come in a bunch of colors in sizes 5-12. $164 at AmazonAdvertisement
5NikeNike Air Max 270A 41-year-old Facebook user with the display name Persnickety Plates recommended Nike Air Max 270s, saying she owns them in multiple colorways. Previously, surgical assistant Shakira McNeal also recommended these kicks, saying: "For the last year I have been wearing Nike brand 270s! I love them! I do surgery all day and they feel like I’m walking on air! I originally bought them for style and I put them on for work one day and NEVER LOOKED BACK!"

The Ultraventures are my favorite pair!" As cushioned trail runners, these kicks stay comfortable for miles and miles of walking time. The slight platform protects your underfoot and gives you some extra cushion, and the increased toe sweep helps with the transition between steps or strides. Best of all, these offer a Vibram outsole, making them extra tough while still looking nice. These come in four colors in sizes 6-11.$112 at REIAdvertisement
7AmazonAltra Lone PeakLooking for a hiking shoe that you'll find yourself wearing every day? Ann McGregor, 60, likes the Altra Lone Peak Alpine sneakers, saying on Facebook that they have a "Roomy toe box for my wide feet and bunions."
