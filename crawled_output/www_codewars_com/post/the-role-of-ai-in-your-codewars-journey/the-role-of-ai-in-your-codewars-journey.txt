Back to all postsThe Role of AI in Your Codewars JourneyJake HoffnerSeptember 11, 2025â¢5min readAs AI tools have become more common in the developer workflow, weâve started to see them show up more frequently on Codewars. This is a natural and expected evolution, and understanding how best to use these tools is a must for those who are working in a technical field.At the same time, itâs raised new questions: What does responsible use look like here on Codewars? How do we preserve the spirit of practice, problem-solving, learning, and growth that this community values?Weâve updated our Code of Conduct with new AI Fair Use Guidelines to set clear expectations about the use of AI in solving kata. These rules are simple: use AI as a tool to support your learning, not to bypass it.âYou can still use tools like Copilot or ChatGPT to debug, get explanations, or explore different approaches. But using AI tools to generate solutions and submit those solutions without effort, input or understanding, as well as auto-solving katas to game the system for honor or ranking undermines the entire learning experience for you and everyone else.âWeâre also asking for transparency when AI shapes your explanations in discussions, and discouraging public sharing of full AI-generated answers. We want Codewars to remain a space where effort, curiosity, and iteration matter.âWhy Now?âThings are shifting quickly in how developers work. Weâre updating now so Codewars can stay relevant while staying true to the kind of learning this community has always valued.âSince Carrol Chang became CEO of Andela (our parent company) in late 2024, sheâs been focused on making sure human developers arenât left behind as AI becomes a bigger part of how software gets built. Her approach is straightforward: AI is reshaping technical work, and the best way to protect developers is to make sure theyâre ready to lead in that shift. That means having a strong grasp of the fundamentals, practising manually, and using AI tools to assist learning and how you approach problems, not to give you the answers. As we move into planning for the coming year, we are taking a deep look at community feedback, including the pressing items that are logged in GitHub, conversations in Discord, and the recent Codewars Census to help shape what is to come. While the Census is still wrapping up, one thing is clear from this sneak peek of the results â this community is as optimistic as we are about AI tools and the potential they have to improve how we work with responsible and ethical use. Keep an eye out for the full report that will be made available in October.The purpose of Codewars has always been about pushing developers towards mastering their craft. As AI quickly becomes part of the engineering toolkit, we look forward to finding new avenues for incorporating it into the Codewars experience.âThank you for sticking with us through this journey.Â ââ JakeâShare this post
