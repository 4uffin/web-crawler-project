Contributor spotlight
There are many other things I like about MDN: the openness of its
governance, the respect for contributors' work, the professional
conversations, and the always timely reviews. MDN has consistently
demonstrated the ideal form of an open-source project.
Joshua Chen (MDN contributor)
MDN Web Docs has the most up-to-date and accurate information and the
content is presented in an easy-to-understand manner. I also like that it's
available in many languages (very important!).
Yuji (MDN contributor)
There are millions of web developers in China, and many of them begin their
developer journey at MDN Web Docs. Contributing to MDN Web Docs is an
excellent way to help people who are starting out.
