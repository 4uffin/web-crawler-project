We only just put Apple's iPhone 17 launch event behind us, but Bloomberg's Mark Gurman is already glancing into his crystal ball to see what's next for the company. In today's Power On newsletter Gurman says that there are at least 10 more products from Apple that are expected to launch either later this year [&#8230;]

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Disclosure: Penske Media Corporation is an investor in Vox Media, The Verge’s parent company.</em></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Penske Media Corporation, the publisher of <em>Rolling Stone</em> and <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em>, has become the first major American media company to sue Google over its AI summaries. The company claims that the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/14/24155321/google-search-ai-results-page-gemini-overview">AI Overviews</a> that often appear at the top of search results leave users with little reason to click through to the source, hurting traffic and illegally benefitting from the work of its reporters. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">While Penske Media is the biggest name to take on Google over its AI Overviews, it’s not the first. Online education company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/619051/chegg-google-ai-overviews-monopoly">Chegg sued Google</a> in February, as did a group of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/698486/european-publishers-have-beef-with-googles-ai-overviews">independent publishers</a> in Europe. The News / Media Alliance has also spoken out about the feature, calling it the “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/672132/news-media-alliance-google-ai-mode-theft">definition of theft</a>” and seeking action from the DOJ.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Google spokesperson José Castañeda defended the summaries to the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/rolling-stone-publisher-sues-google-over-ai-summaries-3afde408"><em>Wall Street Journal</em></a> saying, “with AI Overviews, people find search more helpful and use it more.” But Penske and other publishers say there is little reason to follow the links provided in search results and, as a result, they have seen <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/google-ai-news-publishers-7e687141?mod=article_inline">significant drops in traffic and revenue</a>. Penske claims in the suit that revenue from affiliate links is down by over 1/3 this year, and it attributes that directly to a drop in traffic from Google.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The company also claims it’s in a tough situation. It can either block Google from indexing its content, essentially removing itself from all search results, which would further devastate its business. Or, it can continue to provide training material to Google for its AI, “adding fuel to a fire that threatens PMC’s [Penske Media Corporation] entire publishing business,” the complaint states, according to the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">This is, of course, just the latest battle between AI companies and the creators of the content they harvest. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/777344/perplexity-lawsuit-encyclopedia-britannica-merriam-webster">Encyclopedia Britannica and Merriam-Webster</a> recently sued Perplexity, as did <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/21/24275924/news-corp-wall-street-journal-perplexity-lawsuit-copyright-infringement">News Corp</a> last year. Meanwhile Microsoft and OpenAI have found themselves in the crosshairs of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/27/24016212/new-york-times-openai-microsoft-lawsuit-copyright-infringement">New York Times</a>, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/30/24145603/ai-openai-microsoft-new-york-daily-news-sue-copyright">New York Daily News, the Chicago Tribune</a>, and others. Google might also have a tougher time defending itself now that it’s been forced to admit that “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/773928/google-open-web-rapid-decline">the open web is already in rapid decline</a>,” as it faces multiple <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/650665/google-loses-ad-tech-antitrust-monopoly-lawsuit">antitrust</a><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23869483/us-v-google-search-antitrust-case-updates"> </a><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23869483/us-v-google-search-antitrust-case-updates">complaints</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Other deals our readers loved this week</h2>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Lego kits are really popular, but the more elaborate types can quickly get pricey. If you just want to brighten up your home and do a quick bit of affordable building, you can get a <strong>pair of Lego sunflowers</strong> for only $7.99 (normally up to $14.99) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09PJ8ZZ1G">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.target.com/p/lego-sunflowers-building-toy-set-40524/-/A-89211146">Target</a>, and <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/2KC0QFWRI1RO">Walmart</a>. If you’d rather spend your entire weekend absorbed in Lego building, you can get <strong>the house from the Pixar movie <em>Up</em></strong> for $38.49 (normally $59.99, a savings of $21.50) at <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/LEGO-Disney-Pixar-Up-House-43217-100-Celebration-Classic-Building-Toy-Set-Kids-Movie-Fans-Ages-9-A-Fun-Gift-Anyone-Who-Loves-Creative-Play/1527935978?wmlspartner=wlpa&amp;selectedSellerId=0&amp;wl13=5447&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;adid=222222222771527935978_117755028669_12420145346&amp;wl0=&amp;wl1=g&amp;wl2=c&amp;wl3=501107745824&amp;wl4=pla-394283752452&amp;wl5=9004345&amp;wl6=&amp;wl7=&amp;wl8=&amp;wl9=pla&amp;wl10=8175035&amp;wl11=local&amp;wl12=1527935978&amp;veh=sem_LIA&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=12420145346&amp;gbraid=0AAAAADmfBIorx9U9OwDWZSwbo11eTgfc1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwiY_GBhBEEiwAFaghvql_ESwqKt4h6iB7RcmCQxLbBf6aHBMtJyvI6o6L5elWIcaaUJ75wxoCwAkQAvD_BwE">Walmart</a>.</li>
<li>Several <em>Verge </em>readers have dug this launch deal on the <strong>Baseus VD1 Pro dash cam</strong>, which is $109.99 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0FJ28QX2C">Amazon</a> (instead of $169.99). The system comes with two components: the front camera has a solar panel that powers its rechargeable battery, allowing it to detect motion and impacts for up to 14 days — without sipping on your car’s battery. It also includes a rear camera that can see what’s happening behind your car.</li>
<li>The college football season is well underway, and if you can’t get enough of seeing your favorite team hit the field every week, we suggest getting <em><strong>EA Sports College Football 26</strong></em> for the PS5 or Xbox Series X. The game was $20 off when we first covered the deal earlier this week, but it has since dropped to almost $30 off at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/EA-SPORTS-College-Football-26-PlayStation/dp/B0F64HM6B5">Amazon</a>, at least for the PS5 version. It’s $49.99 for the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/EA-SPORTS-College-Football-26-PlayStation/dp/B0F646DTXH">Xbox version</a>, which is still a nice deal. </li>
<li>If your chosen way to escape is to take a refreshing run while listening to your favorite tunes, then you may want to check out the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/24/24252192/nothing-ear-open-wireless-earbuds-headphones-available"><strong>Nothing Ear Open</strong></a>, the company’s first pair of open-style earbuds, which are now on sale at&nbsp;<a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.nothing.tech%2Fproducts%2Fear-open%3FColour%3DWhite&amp;xcust=__vg0912awD__772636__________________theverge.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nothing’s online storefront</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nothing-Open-Ear-Headphones-Technology-Compatible/dp/B0DGLL5CWK/?tag=theverge02-20&amp;ascsubtag=__vg0912awD__772636__________________theverge.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon</a>&nbsp;for an all-time low $99 ($50 off) with a Prime membership.</li>
<li>Not every gamer wants a bulky over-ear headset. <strong>Sony’s Inzone Buds</strong> are a great, significantly more compact alternative, and they’re cheaper than ever this week. <a href="https://www.gamestop.com/electronics/audio/headphones/earbuds-in-ear-headphones/products/sony-inzone-buds-truly-wireless-noise-canceling-gaming-earbuds-for-playstation-5-and-pc---white/412019.html">GameStop</a> has them for $143.98 ($86 off), and no other retailers are matching the price.
