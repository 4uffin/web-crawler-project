<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s September, and many among us are dealing with back to school, and anticipating the colder weather that’s on its way (at least, if you live in the northern climes). This, plus a somewhat fraught political atmosphere, means that you might be looking for reliable, affordable ways to escape the doldrums.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">You don’t need us to tell you that a way to do that is by watching some movies and TV shows. Through September 18th, Paramount is offering a doozy of a deal on both tiers of its Plus streaming service. You can save 50 percent on an annual subscription to <a href="https://paramountplus.qflm.net/c/482924/175360/3065?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.paramountplus.com%2F&amp;subId2=[vg0912awD][771361][][][][][][][][][theverge.com]" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paramount Plus Essential, or its mostly ad-free Premium</a> plan. The Essential Plan is down to $29.99 (from $59.99) and a Premium plan goes to $59.99 (from $119.99). The neat thing is that you can take advantage of this whether you’re a new or a returning subscriber (but be careful to mark your calendar; it will renew after that year at full price).</p>
<div class="product-block"><h3>Paramount Plus Essential (annual subscription)</h3>
<div class="product-description">Essential gets you ad-supported access to TV shows and movies. You won’t be able to download content, but you get many of the same benefits as Premium.</div>
<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.paramountplus.com/?cbscidmt=nfl"> <strike>$59.99</strike> $29.99 at <strong>Paramount Plus</strong></a></li></ul></div>
<div class="product-block"><h3>Paramount Plus Premium (annual subscription)</h3>
<div class="product-description">The Premium tier allows for downloads, and content can be viewed without ads (except during live TV). You’ll also get access to Showtime series and CBS.</div>
<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.paramountplus.com/?cbscidmt=thechi"> <strike>$119.99</strike> $59.99 at <strong>Paramount</strong></a></li></ul></div>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s a tempting deal, whether you go for the ad-supported Essential or the skip-the-ads Premium. The latter also lets you download your shows, which could be very handy when you’re traveling with kids, and from its library of Showtime Originals. Either way, you not only get recent shows like <em>Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em>, the entire <em>Yellowston</em>e catalog, <em>Top Gun: Maverick</em>, <em>Star Trek: Strange New Worlds</em>, and <em>Bob Marley: One Love</em>, but animation series like <em>South Park</em> and <em>SpongeBob</em> <em>Squarepants</em>, and live NFL games. Also, it hosts every <em>Mission Impossible</em> movie, aside from the latest one, <em>The Final Reckoning</em>.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Other deals our readers loved this week</h2>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Lego kits are really popular, but the more elaborate types can quickly get pricey. If you just want to brighten up your home and do a quick bit of affordable building, you can get a <strong>pair of Lego sunflowers</strong> for only $7.99 (normally up to $14.99) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09PJ8ZZ1G">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.target.com/p/lego-sunflowers-building-toy-set-40524/-/A-89211146">Target</a>, and <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/2KC0QFWRI1RO">Walmart</a>. If you’d rather spend your entire weekend absorbed in Lego building, you can get <strong>the house from the Pixar movie <em>Up</em></strong> for $38.49 (normally $59.99, a savings of $21.50) at <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/LEGO-Disney-Pixar-Up-House-43217-100-Celebration-Classic-Building-Toy-Set-Kids-Movie-Fans-Ages-9-A-Fun-Gift-Anyone-Who-Loves-Creative-Play/1527935978?wmlspartner=wlpa&amp;selectedSellerId=0&amp;wl13=5447&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;adid=222222222771527935978_117755028669_12420145346&amp;wl0=&amp;wl1=g&amp;wl2=c&amp;wl3=501107745824&amp;wl4=pla-394283752452&amp;wl5=9004345&amp;wl6=&amp;wl7=&amp;wl8=&amp;wl9=pla&amp;wl10=8175035&amp;wl11=local&amp;wl12=1527935978&amp;veh=sem_LIA&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=12420145346&amp;gbraid=0AAAAADmfBIorx9U9OwDWZSwbo11eTgfc1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwiY_GBhBEEiwAFaghvql_ESwqKt4h6iB7RcmCQxLbBf6aHBMtJyvI6o6L5elWIcaaUJ75wxoCwAkQAvD_BwE">Walmart</a>.</li>
<li>Several <em>Verge </em>readers have dug this launch deal on the <strong>Baseus VD1 Pro dash cam</strong>, which is $109.99 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0FJ28QX2C">Amazon</a> (instead of $169.99). The system comes with two components: the front camera has a solar panel that powers its rechargeable battery, allowing it to detect motion and impacts for up to 14 days — without sipping on your car’s battery. It also includes a rear camera that can see what’s happening behind your car.</li>
<li>The college football season is well underway, and if you can’t get enough of seeing your favorite team hit the field every week, we suggest getting <em><strong>EA Sports College Football 26</strong></em> for the PS5 or Xbox Series X. The game was $20 off when we first covered the deal earlier this week, but it has since dropped to almost $30 off at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/EA-SPORTS-College-Football-26-PlayStation/dp/B0F64HM6B5">Amazon</a>, at least for the PS5 version. It’s $49.99 for the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/EA-SPORTS-College-Football-26-PlayStation/dp/B0F646DTXH">Xbox version</a>, which is still a nice deal. </li>
<li>If your chosen way to escape is to take a refreshing run while listening to your favorite tunes, then you may want to check out the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/24/24252192/nothing-ear-open-wireless-earbuds-headphones-available"><strong>Nothing Ear Open</strong></a>, the company’s first pair of open-style earbuds, which are now on sale at&nbsp;<a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.nothing.tech%2Fproducts%2Fear-open%3FColour%3DWhite&amp;xcust=__vg0912awD__772636__________________theverge.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nothing’s online storefront</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nothing-Open-Ear-Headphones-Technology-Compatible/dp/B0DGLL5CWK/?tag=theverge02-20&amp;ascsubtag=__vg0912awD__772636__________________theverge.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon</a>&nbsp;for an all-time low $99 ($50 off) with a Prime membership.</li>
<li>Not every gamer wants a bulky over-ear headset. <strong>Sony’s Inzone Buds</strong> are a great, significantly more compact alternative, and they’re cheaper than ever this week. <a href="https://www.gamestop.com/electronics/audio/headphones/earbuds-in-ear-headphones/products/sony-inzone-buds-truly-wireless-noise-canceling-gaming-earbuds-for-playstation-5-and-pc---white/412019.html">GameStop</a> has them for $143.98 ($86 off), and no other retailers are matching the price.

It takes the rules and structure of the game - which strands players inside of a looping hallway in a Tokyo subway station - and then builds on them with actual characters and a story.

While interviewing OpenAI CEO Sam Altman this week, former Fox News host Tucker Carlson brought up his belief in a conspiracy theory that former OpenAI researcher Suchir Balaji was “definitely murdered.” The researcher’s death in November 2024, which was ruled a suicide by the San Francisco police, followed his release of statements online and in [&#8230;]

<p class="has-text-align-none">While <a href="https://tuckercarlson.com/tucker-show-sam-altman">interviewing OpenAI CEO Sam Altman</a> this week, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/9/23717488/tucker-carlson-fox-news-twitter-free-speech">former</a> Fox News host Tucker Carlson brought up his belief in a conspiracy theory that former OpenAI researcher Suchir Balaji was “definitely murdered.” The researcher’s death in November 2024, which was ruled a suicide by the San Francisco police, followed his release of statements online and in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/technology/openai-copyright-law.html"><em>New York Times</em></a> article calling out OpenAI’s tech for alleged copyright violations. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In their back-and-forth about a half-hour into the chat, Carlson bluntly explains his reasons for believing the theory, and that “[Balji’s] mother claims he was murdered on your orders.” Altman brings up the police reports and their findings after an investigation, later remarking, &#8220;I feel strange and sad debating this, and having to defend myself seems totally crazy, and you are a little bit accusing me,” even as Carlson denies doing so.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Balaji had <a href="https://suchir.net/fair_use.html">said</a> that he was able to, using mathematical analysis, support the conclusion that “OpenAI’s use of copyrighted data violated the law and that technologies like ChatGPT were damaging the internet.” He had been set to testify in the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/27/24016212/new-york-times-openai-microsoft-lawsuit-copyright-infringement"><em>Times</em>’ lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft</a>. However, intellectual property lawyers cited in a report by <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/02/08/openai-whistleblower-suchir-balaji-death-police-investigation-san-francisco-family-questions/#:~:text=And%20one%20intellectual%20property%20lawyer"><em>Fortune</em></a> said his arguments appeared to misunderstand copyright law, and it notes that he hadn’t released new inside information about the company, which some former employees turned whistleblowers have.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Balaji’s mother <a href="https://sfstandard.com/2025/01/08/openai-whistleblowers-death-sparks-dark-conspiracy-theories/">has said she believes he was murdered</a> to benefit OpenAI and other artificial intelligence companies, citing the absence of a note and findings of experts she’s hired. She appeared on Carlson’s show <a href="https://tuckercarlson.com/tucker-show-poornima-rao">earlier this year</a>, in an episode titled “Mother of Likely Murdered OpenAI Whistleblower Reveals All, Calls for Investigation of Sam Altman.” Her view has been promoted since Balaji’s death by Elon Musk and many people around him, as well as several elected officials.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">You can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KmpT-BoVf4&amp;t=2068s">watch the relevant segment of the interview here</a>, but this is what Carlson and Altman said that stuck out:</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Carlson:</strong> “…he was definitely murdered, I think… there were signs of a struggle, of course. The surveillance camera, the wires had been cut. He had just ordered take-out food, come back from a vacation with his friends on Catalina Island. No indication at all that he was suicidal. No note and no behavior. He had just spoken to a family member on the phone.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">And then he&#8217;s found dead with blood in multiple rooms. So that&#8217;s impossible. Seems really obvious he was murdered. Have you talked to the authorities about it?”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Altman:</strong>  I have not talked to the authorities about it. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Carlson: </strong>“Um, and his mother claims he was murdered on your orders. “</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Altman:</strong> “Do you believe that?”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Carlson: </strong>“I- I&#8217;m, Well, I&#8217;m I&#8217;m asking.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Altman: </strong>“I mean… you, you just said it, so do you, do you believe that? </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Carlson:</strong> “I think that it is, um, worth looking into. And I don&#8217;t… I mean, if a guy comes out and accuses your company of committing crimes, I have no idea if that&#8217;s true or not, of course. Um, and then he is found killed, and there are signs of a struggle. I… I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s worth dismissing it…I don&#8217;t think we should say, well, he killed himself when there&#8217;s no evidence that the guy was depressed at all. Um, I think… and if he was your friend, I would think he would want to speak to his mom or…</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Altman: </strong>“I did offer, she didn’t want to.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Carlson: </strong>“So, do you feel that, you know, when people look at that and they&#8217;re like, you know, it&#8217;s possible that happened. Do you feel that that reflects the worries they have about what&#8217;s happening here? Like people are afraid that this is like…”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Altman: </strong>“I haven&#8217;t done too many interviews where I&#8217;ve been accused of, like…”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Carlson:</strong> “Oh, I&#8217;m not accusing you at all. I&#8217;m just saying his, his mother says that.”</p>

Elon Musk is pressing Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella to look into Blizzard employees who criticized Charlie Kirk after his death. Musk’s post quotes an X thread listing names and screenshots of the developers. “What’s going on here, @satyanadella?” Musk said. “These are Microsoft employees,” he added in another post. Musk’s direct question to Nadella follows [&#8230;]

<p class="has-text-align-none">Musk’s direct question to Nadella follows a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/776840/charlie-kirk-death-social-media-jawboning">broader censorship crackdown</a> from Republicans targeting individuals celebrating Kirk’s death or criticizing him. Rep. Clay Higgins (R-LA) said he would use “Congressional authority and every influence with big tech platforms to mandate immediate ban for life of every post or commenter that belittled the assassination of Charlie Kirk.”&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Former Blizzard developer Mark Kern, who goes by “Grummz” online and frequently posts about right-wing issues on X, quoted the <a href="https://x.com/bifuriousum/status/1966337179241886120">original thread</a>, claiming that the screenshotted posts showed Blizzard employees “trashing” Kirk. Musk then quoted the post himself with his question to Nadella.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“We&#8217;re aware of the views expressed by a small subset of our employees regarding recent events,” Microsoft said <a href="https://x.com/Microsoft/status/1966626714148368766">in a post on X</a>. The post is not a reply to Musk but was shared on its main @Microsoft page. “We take matters like this very seriously and we are currently reviewing each individual situation. Comments celebrating violence against anyone are unacceptable and do not align with our values.” (The screenshots in the thread shared by Musk do not celebrate the shooting against Kirk.) Nadella has not replied to Musk publicly as of this writing.</p>
