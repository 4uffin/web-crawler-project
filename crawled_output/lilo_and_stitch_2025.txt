Lilo & Stitch
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Recapturing the adorable charm of the original if not quite matching its rambunctious sense of imagination, Lilo & Stitch emerges out of the crate as one of the better live-action remakes of a Disney classic.

In theory, I should be pro-change... except that Lilo & Stitch doesn’t really commit to its big alterations.

Empire Magazine
Fleischer Camp brings a light touch and a good human cast to this reverently faithful effort, but it’s never as clear and bright as its source material.
Rated: 3/5

Jake Wilson
Sydney Morning Herald
The director Dean Fleischer Camp isn’t trying to recapture the arthouse audience who went for the sophisticated faux-naivety of his 2021 Marcel the Shell With Shoes On. But he does ground the whimsy in a baseline level of realism...
Rated: 3/5

Mac the Movie Guy
While it doesn’t make a case for longevity, Lilo and Stitch is entertaining enough to justify the curiosity of seeing for yourself if this Ohana can be a part of your family. probably not, but it is worth a shot.
Rated: 73/100

We may not have needed a live-action version of Lilo & Stitch, but at least it keeps the spirit of ‘Ohana’ alive through a product that blends nostalgia with a fresh appeal to new generations. [Full Review in Spanish]

Every part of this film provided that same sense of ohana and warmness I felt as a kid, if not more.

I wanted to escape my kids acting up only to see Lilo & Stitch get yelled at for 2 hours! I could've stayed home and yelled at them for free.

I liked the live action. Graphics were great but disney messed up the story line not adding one of the main characters gantu. the sequels and the rest of the story line won't hold up without this character. there will be plot holes and jumba and plikly cant be the uncle figures to lilo and nani and lilo are apart. Disney keeps messing up there live actions since snow white came out and im sure they will mess up moana too and I hate that they paused or scrapped aristocats just give us a new story and stop doing remakes or actually give us what we ask for and stop trying to act "WOKE". it would be better to follow the same story line and add new songs as they see fit or more detail in certain scenes to make it a little more exciting but us as viewers just want the same movie as it is just live action how hard is that.
