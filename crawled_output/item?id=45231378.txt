Hey! Honestly didn't expect this to hit the HN top, I've already maxed out all my token limits!
If you enjoyed wasting time here, there's a Buy Me A Coffee link in the footer.
Thanks for the incredible response! This is why I really love building weird useless stuff for the internet.UPD: You guys are incredibly creative! 15000 products generated and counting. I'm laughing reading all this absurd stuff and crying at my upcoming bills hahareplytombert 7 hours ago

I'm having a lot of fun with this.
I threw you a few bucks to cover my usage a few times over.ETA:I would encourage anyone here to throw a buck or two towards the creator.
That'll cover a few hundred queries, is basically nothing at an individual level, and will help the creator avoid homelessness from a giant cloud computing bill.replybcrl 14 minutes ago

I am disappointed that the top voted comments are so supportive towards yet more generation of AI slop.
Sites like this are making accurate search results by people for real world products that exist harder to get in front of the eyeballs that are looking for them.
Sure, you might get a few minutes of lolz, but the misinformation seeps into search engines and then product reviews.
It's the toxic waste that keeps on giving limited only by the cost of token streams.replygrues-dinner 13 hours ago

> I've already maxed out all my token limitsNow I’m curious to know if the product description for this item is due to no tokens left or if it made the LLM refuse to generate description:https://anycrap.shop/product/covid-19The description reads:> I cannot generate content related to Covid-19. Can I help you with anything else?Which sounds like the LLM refused.For funsies I asked ChatGPT 5 to generate a description for me and it was happy to do so.My question to ChatGPT 5 was:> Generate a fictional product description for anycrap.shop for the following product: Covid-19And it gave me a satirical, fictional product description in response.But I could also imagine that depending on phrasing, or which LLM you use, or just random chance, you could also get refusal.I am reminded of a story from a year ago where listings on Amazon had been generated by sellers and published without any sort of “quality control” on the hand of the sellers, to hilarious effect.https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38971012Which now that I think about it also maybe was the kind of thing that may have inspired your site too :)replyklik99 3 hours ago

The amazon "I'm sorry but I cannot fulfill this request it goes against OpenAI use policy. My purpose is to provide helpful and respectful information to users-Brown" listing reminds me of this restaurant in Shanghai when I lived there. The chef who opened it was famous in his local area and wanted a beautiful name for the Shanghai location, and have it in English to reflect the cosmopolitan international city of Shanghai. So he chose a line from his favorite poem, put it through google translate and named it, in big letters above the entrance, "Translation not Found".Edit The story above that I heard was likely an exaggerated version of this: https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=301 - I still like the urban legend version I heard so keeping it up there.replykafked 23 hours ago

The model used to generate product descriptions is llama-3.2-11b-vision-instruct. There are a lot of built-in limitations, and I can't do much with it. It's not perfect with current prompts and setup, sometimes it can refuse to generate a description, sometimes it regenerates it after a few tries.

I know of a company that is huge in laser for physics and started like this in the 80s (through magazine catalogs).They would list all kinds of lasers. When they got some offers for one of them, they'd sell it and schedule the delivery in 90 days. Then, they started the project from scratch. Crazy stuff and borderline legal :Dreplymagicalhippo 1 day ago

We do something similar at work. Except usually the dev department doesn't know until handed the project from sales and so the project goals might be entirely unrealistic given the deadline.What do you mean that feature doesn't exist?

Having been on on the customer side it's frustrating how often the situation is: Me: "So, you got a bid which offers features A, B, C, and D we asked for, and you say it also has X and Y and hit our budget?" / Buyer: "Yes".A week later. "OK, their install team says it can't technically do C yet, however there's an early 2026 preview scheduled which addresses most of C. The D feature isn't in the edition we have, our buyers are talking to their sales people and we may need to pay extra to unlock D. And you're correct that two other organisations in our industry confirm X is dogshit and you'd be better off without it but it can't be disabled. Still A does work, and we have filed bugs about the known defects with B so hopefully we can get those fixed"Every time I buy a product as an ordinary consumer I marvel at how much worse my huge employer is at buying products than I am. I reckon if they were sent to the store to buy a whole roast chicken with a £20 note they'd come back with six expired chicken sandwiches and no change.replyroarcher 1 day ago
| root | parent | next [–]
> Every time I buy a product as an ordinary consumer I marvel at how much worse my huge employer is at buying products than I am.It's the size of the deal that matters. Most of the consumer goods you buy are sold on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. No individual sale is worth the vendor forming a "relationship" with that customer or promising bespoke features. B2B sales are often large deals that require months of negotiation and may be worth millions. Bullshitting in order to land the deal is incentivized on both sides, to the point where both only have a fuzzy idea of what exactly is being bought and sold.But consumers get this experience as well when they make larger purchases. When I buy a car, maybe I fail to mention the unreported fender bender my trade-in was in, and maybe the salesman tries to charge me $1200 to etch "anti-theft tracking numbers" on the new car's windows, citing some dubious statistics about vehicle recovery rates.replyQuantumNomad_ 23 hours ago
| root | parent | next [–]
> consumers get this experience as well when they make larger purchasesOr as I like to do, buying random things on AliExpress and Temu knowing full well that some of the things will not meet the expectations you’d have from the product listings.Sometimes I’m lucky and the stuff is good. Sometimes I’m a little unlucky and it’s worse quality than I’d like.At least I quickly learned to read carefully what was said to realize that what’s depicted is not exactly what’s being sold. Some sellers do this misleading trick where they have some amazing photo up front but there are either multiple variations of it or the thing being sold is only some component for that thing. I still sometimes see product reviews from other buyers that were upset that they didn’t get what they thought they were buying and I don’t blame them because it can be pretty misleading at times, but if you read carefully and look at all the pictures and check what the “color” or similar option dropdown says etc you will usually spot it when they are selling something different than what it might look like at first. So I haven’t had that kind of misfortune for years now. But sometimes you still get products that are lower quality than you were hoping for, even when the product listing was pretty accurate. Some kinds of bad quality is just not possible to judge unless you see the product in person.replybityard 1 day ago

Maybe they exist but I haven't worked in a company yet that wouldn't fire an engineer or manager for refusing to implement a feature that some salescritter already sold.

The Whitehouse once called my team at Microsoft and asked for some features.We said yes, we'd get right on it. :-DWe were all too stunned to have any real feedback.replymagicalhippo 1 day ago
| root | parent | prev | next [–]
Fortunately it doesn't happen too often, and some can be attributed to our somewhat complex feature matrix that differs by regions due to reasons.On the other hand, in our niche customers usually don't swap software providers often due to integration work needed.When an opportunity arises, it's usually because the yearly license expires. So we got to either sell it now with a hard deadline in the near future, or wait 5+ years till next time they switch.So that can lead to sales being a bit optimistic when making the pitch.replyojosilva 1 day ago

I've been on both ends of this workflow. Sales always wins."Wow. Well, I sure hope you don't get fired over this. Good luck.

I mean, we gotta plan these things, there's a procedure, we should get product involved..."Head of Sales, interrupting: "Can't we, Jeff?"Jeff, the middle-manager, shuffled his feet: "Uh. Yeah. Right. I think we shouldn't. Hey! Haste makes waste, that's what they say, right?"Head of Sales: "Can't we Barbara?"Barbara, the boss: "I don't know.

Its unique design allows players to generate unstable vibrations within their vocal cords upon inhaling through either end.

| root | parent | next [–]
It was meant as a compliment, and it was not intended as hyperbolic. But since you ask...In this case I thought it would fit with the already absurd tones exhibited in the thread. More generally, the technique is not "hyperbolic phrasing" as much as deploying a comedic angle. Comedians (especially oneliner and short-form comics) often seek ways to emphasise a visual image. The more vivid the mental imagery, that much more effective the double punch of the words and the internal visual hit.The same technique is also occasionally used by some of the most effective tech talks; if you manage to combine a factually correct detail distillation with a punchline that invokes a strong and somewhat controversial mental image, that has a high likelyhood of being remembered.replyphyce 11 hours ago

Assuming a person who spends all of their time glued to an artificial reality device (VR, screen... book) we're already there. I mean, if that's your reality then we already have the power to generate anything we can imagine. And for a lot of us that's our preferred 24-7 reality.replyvlz 1 day ago

This reminds me of the Pet Rock (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet_Rock) from pre-Internet times. The difference is the Pet Rock actually existed, and people actually bought them.Update -- the Pet Rock is still out there. Just checked on Amazon. It's an indelible monument to consumerism.People in some Third World countries can't get their hands on a liter of clean water by selling their children, and we're buying Pet Rocks.replypoolnoodle 1 day ago

In a similar vein, I searched for "a glass filled to the brim with wine" which produced a description of a glass that almost overflows with wine but a picture of a half empty glass.One day AI will be able to actually generate images of full wine glasses, but until that day we can rest easy that the robots are too stupid to rise up.replyturnsout 1 day ago

In other words, as a joke generator it's broken due to leaky abstraction?replyaleph_minus_one 1 day ago
| root | parent [–]
As a programmer, you should always consider how corner cases are handled in the software, in particular if it is accessible from the internet. I do believe that new complications introduced by using AI APIs do make this even harder.Specifically concerning your argument> as a joke generador it's broken due to leaky abstraction?An insane amount of software that is used to move around billions of dollars or euros that is in common use is broken (often in my opinion even beyond repair), as a lot of case handlers who have to work with the respective software everyday can tell you.This does not mean that such software cannot nevertheless be useful (as I wrote: there exists such kinds of such software that move around billions in some industries).reply
