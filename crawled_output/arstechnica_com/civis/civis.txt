The Server Room
New
This forum is dedicated to the "bigger picture" topics--high-level systems that don't easily fit in the other forums. Before you can build a server room, there must be understanding of the requirements and technologies. This forum, then, is for the architects, the designers, and the decision makers for IT systems.
