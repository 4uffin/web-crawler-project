`__str__` of a subclass is not called in an f-string

I wrote a subclass of Decimal to represent an amount of money. I wrote a custom __str__ to display the currency along with a sign format. My method works when calling str() but in a f-string somehow my custom __str__ is not used. What is happening here?
More than workarounds, I'm interested in understanding what is happening here. Something is going on that defies my current understanding of
__str__, __format__ and inheritance. I thought the default behavior of format with no format specified was to delegate to str, but here it sends it to str of the parent class instead.
Here is the minimal code to reproduce:
from decimal import Decimal
class Money(Decimal):
CURRENCY = "€"
def __new__(cls, number):
return super().__new__(cls, Decimal(number).quantize(Decimal("0.01")))
def __str__(self):
return f"{self:+}{self.CURRENCY}"
m = Money(10)
print("Test 1 - str():", str(m))
print("Test 2 - print():", m)
print(f"Test 3 - f-string: {m}")
print("Test 4 - f-string str():", f"{str(m)}")
This results in
Test 1 - str(): +10.00€
Test 2 - print(): +10.00€
Test 3 - f-string: 10.00 # only here is my custom str not called
Test 4 - f-string str(): +10.00€
Python version is 3.13.7
Edit:
The solution I found that work is the following:
def __str__(self):
return super().__format__("+") + self.CURRENCY
def __format__(self, _):
return str(self)
Yet I don't fully understand why this work and not my original solution.

f-strings in Python prioritize __format__ over __str__. Since Money inherits from Decimal, you need to add __format__ to your class for expected behavior.
from decimal import Decimal
class Money(Decimal):
CURRENCY = "€"
def __new__(cls, number):
return super().__new__(cls, Decimal(number).quantize(Decimal("0.01")))
def __format__(self, format_spec: str) -> str:
if not format_spec:
format_spec = "+.2f"
formatted_number = super().__format__(format_spec)
return f"{formatted_number}{self.CURRENCY}"
def __str__(self) -> str:
formatted_number = super().__format__("+.2f")
return f"{formatted_number}{self.CURRENCY}"

your solution makes my four test calls give the same result, but gives me a double currency sign. have you tried it yourself?

@AntoineGallix I did, but focused only on the output relevant to the issue. Missed the redundant symbol. Answer has been updated. Please let me know if results are not as expected.
Also of note the issue was due to how str and format interact. self.CURRENCY was used 2x causing the issue.
