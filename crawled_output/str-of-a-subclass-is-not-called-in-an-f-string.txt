`__str__` of a subclass is not called in an f-string

I wrote a subclass of Decimal to represent an amount of money. I wrote a custom __str__ to display the currency along with a sign format. My method works when calling str() but in a f-string somehow my custom __str__ is not used. What is happening here?
More than workarounds, I'm interested in understanding what is happening here. Something is going on that defies my current understanding of
__str__, __format__ and inheritance. I thought the default behavior of format with no format specified was to delegate to str, but here it sends it to str of the parent class instead.
Here is the minimal code to reproduce:
from decimal import Decimal
class Money(Decimal):
CURRENCY = "€"
def __new__(cls, number):
return super().__new__(cls, Decimal(number).quantize(Decimal("0.01")))
def __str__(self):
return f"{self:+}{self.CURRENCY}"
m = Money(10)
print("Test 1 - str():", str(m))
print("Test 2 - print():", m)
print(f"Test 3 - f-string: {m}")
print("Test 4 - f-string str():", f"{str(m)}")
This results in
Test 1 - str(): +10.00€
Test 2 - print(): +10.00€
Test 3 - f-string: 10.00 # only here is my custom str not called
Test 4 - f-string str(): +10.00€
Python version is 3.13.7.

f-strings in Python prioritize __format__ over __str__. Since Money inherits from Decimal, you need to add __format__ to your class for expected behavior.
from decimal import Decimal
class Money(Decimal):
CURRENCY = "€"
def __new__(cls, number):
return super().__new__(cls, Decimal(number).quantize(Decimal("0.01")))
def __format__(self, format_spec: str) -> str:
if not format_spec:
format_spec = "+.2f"
formatted_number = super().__format__(format_spec)
return f"{formatted_number}{self.CURRENCY}"
def __str__(self) -> str:
formatted_number = super().__format__("+.2f")
return f"{formatted_number}{self.CURRENCY}"

First, you should know the whole process
1. F-strings use `_format_()` method**, not directly `_str_()`
2. When `_format_()` is not defined**, Python falls back to `str()`
3. If a parent class defines `_format_()`, it takes precedence over the subclass's `_str_()`
4. Use `!s` specifier to force string conversion: `f"{obj!s}"`
5. The most robust solution is to override `_format_()` in your subclass
So you can use these solutions to fix your problem
1,Override `_format_` method
class Parent:
def __str__(self):
return "Parent string"
def __format__(self, format_spec):
return str(self)
class Child(Parent):
def __str__(self):
return "Child string"
def __format__(self, format_spec):
return str(self)
# This ensures __str__ is called
# Test
child = Child()
print(f"{child}")
# Output: Child string

The __format__ method is not meant to be called explicitly as pointed out in this post
I would suggest:
from decimal import Decimal
class Money(Decimal):
QUANT = Decimal("0.01")
FORMAT = "+.2f"
def __new__(cls, number):
return super().__new__(cls, Decimal(number).quantize(Money.QUANT))
def __format__(self, format_spec):
return super().__format__(format_spec or Money.FORMAT) + "€"
def __str__(self):
return f"{self:{Money.FORMAT}}"
money = Money("1.123")
print(f"{money}")
print(f"{money:+.4f}")
print(money)
Output:
+1.12€
+1.1200€
+1.12€
