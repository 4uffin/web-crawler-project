Radheyan Simonpillai
CBC Radio
Emily Blunt is the heavyweight performer delivering an electric charge to a somewhat dramatically flat answer to Raging Bull.

Peter Howell
Toronto Star
Supporting performances from real UFC legends and a Kerr cameo add to the palpable naturalism of this sweat fest, which aims for the heart rather than the head.

Mark Hanson
Slant Magazine
Despite the retro vérité aesthetic that Benny Safdie employs to give Mark Kerr’s story a stylish new coat of paint, all that his version ultimately does is whip up a feeling of déjà vu.
Rated: 2/4

Joonatan Itkonen
Toisto.net
A tremendous piece of directing and acting working together to remind us that beyond the glamour and showmanship, Dwayne Johnson is a bonafide actor waiting to break out of his shell.
Rated: 4/5

That Shelf
A compelling work that often defies convention, The Smashing Machine is a revelation.

Ruben Peralta Rigaud
Cocalecas
one of the most honest films of the year. Because it dares to look at glory from the other side, to tell a story where muscle isn't enough, where strength doesn't save. [Full review in Spanish]
