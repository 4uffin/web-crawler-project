Affordable and reliable. Easy to use and install. Consistent response times. Compatible with voice-control systems including Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and August Smart Locks. Good selection of add-ons. Other things to know: Optional monitoring plan is slightly cheaper than that of our top pick, but doesn’t provide video storage. Kit includes base station, keypad, motion sensor, eight entry sensors, two outdoor cameras. Costco membership required; limit of two per member.Read the reviewThe Best Home Security SystemPosted 4 hours agoCopy linkEditTop pickOXO Good Grips 3-Tier Aluminum Shower Caddy$42 $52 Save $10Buy from The Container Store Price reflects in cart, with store pickupWhat we like: Our longtime top pick for the best shower caddy. High-quality and durable. The easiest of our picks to install. Grippy rubberized hook and suction cups add stability. Keeps bottles of varying sizes tidy and accessible. Holds more than most others we tested. Other things to know: Doesn't adjust up and down. Top shelf may be too high to reach for some. Generally, suction cups don’t work well on uneven or porous tile surfaces. Lifetime guarantee. Price reflects in cart; select store pickup to avoid shipping fees.  Read the reviewThe Best Shower CaddyPosted 5 hours agoCopy linkEditWorth consideringKenmore SpotLite Portable Carpet Spot & Pet Stain Cleaner Vac$89 $100 Save $11Buy from Amazon What we like: A portable carpet and upholstery cleaner worth considering as an alternative to Bissell. Gets the job done. Scored slightly higher on our carpet-cleaning test than our best-for pick, and beat that model by a whisker on coffee and red-wine stains. Other things to know: A bit clunky. Inflexible hose. Comes with a trial size of Kenmore’s cleaning solution, but it can’t be purchased online; a Kenmore spokesperson told us that any cleaning formula can be used with the machine.Read the reviewThe Best Portable Carpet and Upholstery CleanerPosted 5 hours agoCopy linkEditWorth consideringAluratek Streamcast Pro Wireless HDMI Video Transmitter$60 $80 Save $20Buy from Amazon With delayed shippingWhat we like: A wireless HDMI video transmitter worth considering if you want an affordable in-room option that’s good for travel. Wi-Fi–based system that can transmit 1080p 60 Hz video and stereo audio. Transmitter and receiver units are basic HDMI dongles with no other connections beyond USB-C power ports. Other things to know: Has no HDMI or IR pass-through, as you get with our picks. To send a signal from a computer that lacks HDMI, you need either a USB-C–to–HDMI or Lightning-to-HDMI adapter cable (sold separately). Despite the claimed specs, this system is not good for broadcasting over longer distances. Delayed shipping.Read the reviewThe Best Wireless HDMI Video TransmitterPosted 5 hours agoCopy linkEditBest for...Windmill AC with WhisperTech$400 $450 Save $50Buy from Walmart What we like: The best air conditioner for easy installation. One of the nicest-looking options we’ve ever tested, with rounded corners and subtle indicator lights that won’t keep you up at night. Pre-installed frame fits right in the window with a stylish plastic cover over the back. Inverter compressor is just as efficient as our top pick. Other things to know: You can’t open your window while using it. Typically more expensive than our top pick and a little louder. Window support bracket not included. You can’t control the direction of the fan.Read the reviewThe Best Air ConditionerPosted 6 hours agoCopy linkEditTop pickLeatherman Skeletool CX Multi-Tool$72 $90 Save $18Buy from Public Lands Free Public Lands membership required, single-use discount reflects in cartWhat we like: Our longtime top multi-tool pick. Lightweight and slim. Built to last. Has all essentials you'll likely need day-to-day, including needle-nose and regular pliers, wire cutters, two Phillips screwdrivers, two flat screwdrivers, and a handy carabiner clip. Other things to know: Odd asymmetrical design, but it works well ergonomically. Some tools, like scissors, not included. Handles may spread a little too wide for those with smaller hands. Pricey, a worthy investment. Blunt plier tips. 25-year warranty.

Very sturdy and supportive. Features a tensioned fabric seat, a rock-solid frame, and wide feet that don’t sink in sand. With four reclining positions, it’s an easy chair to fall asleep in. Built for a lifetime. Other things to know: Wide enough (25 inches) to accommodate a range of body types without feeling cramped. Heavier and more expensive than our other picks.

Recycled polyester shell and lining that insulate against the cold. Coated with a durable water repellent to protect against moisture. Handy cinch feature customizes sleeping area based on your child's size. Other things to know: Bulky when packed, so better suited to car camping and sleepovers than backpacking. Stuff sack is permanently attached to the bag, making it easy to pack and keep track of. Deal on green or clay. Ships free for REI members; others can select store pickup to avoid shipping fees.Read the reviewThe Best Kids Sleeping BagsPosted 7 hours agoCopy linkEditBest for...Leatherman Signal Multi-Tool$112 $140 Save $28Buy from Public Lands Free Public Lands membership required, single-use discount reflects in cartWhat we like: The best multi-tool for the outdoorsperson. Same set of basic tools as our top pick with additional outdoor and emergency-oriented tools, such as an effective whistle and fire starter. Versatile and durable enough for camping or hiking. Other things to know: Heavier and bulkier than our top pick, but also more robust. Knife is partially serrated, which isn't our favorite. An investment, but we consider it to be a lifetime tool. Single-use discount reflects in cart when signed in with free Public Lands account.Read the reviewThe Best Multi-ToolPosted 7 hours agoCopy linkEditBest for...Yeti Crossroads 22″/35L Wheeled Carry-On Luggage$280 $350 Save $70Buy from Public Lands Free Public Lands membership required, single-use discount reflects in cartWhat we like: The best carry-on for tough conditions. Polycarbonate back and rugged two-wheel design are ideal for rougher travel over difficult surfaces, such as broken streets and uneven curbs. Well-organized and a pleasure to pack. Easy-to-repair parts. Other things to know: Somewhat unwieldy to handle. Weather-resistant, but not waterproof. Front-facing laptop organizer is unshielded. Limited three-year warranty.

The absolute toughest, most durable duffle we recommend. Waterproof even when submerged completely. Solid metal hardware. Includes a plethora of lash points. Comfortable to carry. Also works as a backpack. Other things to know: All that weatherproofing isn’t light — this is the heaviest bag we tested, weighing more than five pounds empty. Pricey, even on sale. Single-use discount reflects in cart when signed in with free Public Lands account.Read the reviewThe Best Duffel BagsPosted 8 hours agoCopy linkEditTop pickLego Classic Medium Creative Brick Box 10696$18 $20 Save $2Buy from Target With store pickup or Circle CardWhat we like: Our top pick for the best bulk box of Lego bricks for kids. Comes with a large variety of shapes in 35 colors, all housed in a distinctive Lego-shaped yellow box. A time-tested choice that offers instructions for a few basic projects and endless possibilities for more. Other things to know: The plastic tote container has room for more as your collection grows. The lid doesn't latch, which could lead to spills. 484 pieces. Recommended for ages four and up. Choose store pickup, use Target Circle Card, or add to an order of $35 or more to avoid shipping fees. Read the reviewThe Best Lego Sets for KidsPosted 8 hours agoCopy linkEditStaff pickClinique Almost Lipstick in Black Honey$13 $25 Save $12Buy from Sephora Free Sephora Beauty Insider membership requiredBuy from Ulta With store pickupBuy from Amazon What we like: A sheer, black cherry–colored lip balm staff pick. Buildable pigment flatters a vast array of skin tones. A cult favorite. Reviewers on the Clinique website also rave about this lip color’s versatility, longevity, hydration, and subtle sheen. Other things to know: Not as pigmented as traditional lipsticks, and on the expensive side, especially compared to what you can find at the drugstore. Fragrance-free and allergy-tested. Select store pickup at Ulta. Ships free with free Sephora Beauty Insider membership.Read the reviewWe Tried to Find a Perfect Dupe for the Black Honey Almost Lipstick. We Couldn’t.Posted 8 hours agoCopy linkEditBudget pickDreo HM311S Smart Humidifier$41 $50 Save $9Buy from Dreo Free Dreo membership required, use promo code BTS10%OFFWhat we like: Our budget humidifier pick. A simple, straightforward humidifier with smart-home capabilities and a built-in night-light. One of the rare ultrasonic models that won’t over-humidify your room. Other things to know: Small tank will still last most of a day. Overall construction doesn’t feel quite as durable as that of our other picks. Lacks a handle, but still relatively portable. On sale in black. Deal price with promo code BTS10%OFF and free Dreo membership. Not the lowest price we've seen; has been $45 for most of September.Read the reviewThe Best HumidifierPosted 9 hours agoCopy linkEditBest for...Beautyblender Original Makeup Sponge$10 $20 Save $10Buy from Sephora Free Sephora Beauty Insider membership requiredBuy from Ulta With store pickupWhat we like: The best makeup sponge. Creates an almost airbrushed finish. Its curves fit all facial contours. Foam expands when wet without feeling mushy and waterlogged. Moistening this sponge creates a barrier that keeps makeup from sinking in and wasting product. Other things to know: Damp sponges can harbor mold. Cleaning the sponge—lathering, rinsing, blotting repeatedly—is a process, but essential. Store pickup required to avoid shipping fees. At Sephora, free Sephora Beauty Insider membership is required for free shipping.Read the reviewThe Best Makeup BrushesPosted 10 hours agoCopy linkEditgift pickUrban Decay Naked3 Soft Pink Eyeshadow Palette$30 $59 Save $29Buy from Sephora Free Sephora Beauty Insider membership requiredBuy from Kohl's With store pickupWhat we like: An eyeshadow palette gift pick in our guide to the best birthday gifts for her. Intensely pigmented but blendable colors. Versatile. Features 12 mostly pink-hued neutrals in a variety of matte and shimmery finishes. Other things to know: Supervising beauty editor Hannah Morrill credits this palette with teaching her how to use eyeshadow. Free Sephora Beauty Insider membership is required for free shipping from Sephora; at Kohl's, choose store pickup to avoid shipping fees.Read the reviewThe 11 Best Birthday Gifts for HerPosted 10 hours agoCopy linkEditTop pickDeuter Kid Comfort Carrier$240 $310 Save $70Buy from Enwild What we like: Our top hiking baby carrier pick. Cushy, easy-to-adjust, and suited for all body types. Kids found it to be a cozy ride. Holds up to a 3L hydration pack and lower zipper compartment can store as much the typical diaper bag. Includes a sunshade, foot stirrups, and a kickstand. The easy-access pockets were the biggest hit among our panel of testers. Other things to know: Once our testers got the hang of it, the single-pull tightening system was fast and easy, but a higher, more convenient buckle could make using the harness more intuitive. The sunshade is easy to lose. Recommended child weight maximum is 48 lbs. Pack alone weighs just over 7 lbs. Lifetime manufacturer warranty.Read the reviewThe Best Hiking Baby CarriersPosted 10 hours agoCopy linkEditLightning DealWorth consideringAnker SOLIX C1000 Portable Power Station$450 $650 Save $200Buy from Amazon What we like: A lightweight portable power station worth considering. Lighter and often cheaper than our upgrade pick. Kept a fan running for 19 hours in our tests. Sturdily built. Has two ergonomic handles and a handy light bar. Comes with cables to recharge itself. Made by a brand we trust with good customer support. Other things to know: Shorter runtime, lower output, and fewer USB-A ports than our upgrade pick, but has a better (five-year) warranty. Weighs 28.4 pounds. A solid deal, but not as good as Prime Day prices.Read the reviewThe Best Portable Power StationPosted 10 hours agoCopy linkWirecutterWirecutter is the product recommendation service from The New York Times.
