Creates smooth contours, with high-back design, seamless edges, and removable molded cups. Soft enough for lounging and supportive enough for active days. Inclusive (and surprisingly spot-on) sizing. Other things to know: Not the cutest, and not ideal for low-cut or strappy tops. Some testers found it too hot and stifling. Not the easiest to pull on. Removable cups may slip out in the wash. Sizes S to 3XL (C to K cup, 30- to 52-inch band). Use code WIRECUTTER25.Read the reviewThe Best, Most Comfortable BrasPosted less than 1 hour agoCopy linkEditTop pickCB2 Pavo Double Floor Lamp$400 $500 Save $100Buy from CB2 With store pickupWhat we like: Our top pick for a statement floor lamp that does double duty. A striking two-in-one lamp. The downward-facing lamp swivels and pivots, so it’s ideal for reading. The upward-facing shade provides indirect light for the rest of the room. Made of sturdy materials that have held up well in our long-term tests. Other things to know: The lamps don’t operate independently. The heavy base prevents the lamp from tipping over, but the poles wiggle a little. Prone to fingerprints. Choose store pickup to avoid shipping fees. Read the reviewThe Best Floor LampsPosted 1 hour agoCopy linkEditUpgrade pickApple MacBook Air (15-Inch, M4, 2025, 16 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD)$1000 $1050 Save $50Buy from Amazon What we like: Our upgrade MacBook pick. The bigger sibling to our top pick, with a larger screen, larger touchpad, and better speakers. With the latest M4 processor, it also keeps cooler and performs better than the 13-inch version during long, intensive tasks like exporting large videos. Sports an upgraded 12-megapixel webcam. Other things to know: Has the same two USB-C Thunderbolt 4 ports, MagSafe port, and headphone jack as its smaller sibling. Street price has dropped significantly since release.Read the reviewThe Best MacBooksPosted 1 hour agoCopy linkEditTop pickApple MacBook Air (13-Inch, M4, 2025, 16 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD)$800 $900 Save $100Buy from Amazon What we like: Our top pick for the best MacBook. Sleek design and an upgraded 12-megapixel webcam. Fast enough for most people, even those who want to code or edit 4K video footage. Has a bright, high-resolution display, a comfortable keyboard and trackpad. Comes with two Thunderbolt 4 USB-C ports, a headphone jack, and a MagSafe port. Other things to know: Can power two external displays. Comes with our recommended specs of 16 GB RAM and 256 GB SSD. We recommend using an external drive or cloud storage rather than spending more for extra internal storage. Deal on all colors.Read the reviewThe Best MacBooksPosted 2 hours agoCopy linkEditPick Accessory$50 Nintendo eGift Card$45 $50 Save $5Buy from Newegg Use promo code SSE595What we like: A nice-to-have gift card for owners of a Nintendo Switch, the most flexible pick in our game console guide.

Outside has a sturdy hard shell with raised panels on the front cover. Effectively prevented us from pushing the Switch’s joysticks down through the case when it was closed. Inner compartment has a mesh zipper pocket that fits the charger and a couple of Joy-Cons. Other things to know: Best if you don't need to take many accessories with you. Separate inner flap holds up to 10 game cards. Several colors on sale.Read the reviewThe Best Nintendo Switch and Switch Lite AccessoriesPosted 2 hours agoCopy linkEditUpgrade pickInsta360 Link 2 Webcam$150 $200 Save $50Buy from Amazon Buy from Best Buy What we like: Our upgrade webcam pick. Provided the best balance of image quality, white balance, and subject tracking. 4K video resolution with solid automatic white balance and exposure control right out of the box. Nifty hand-gesture-activated smart features. Other things to know: Because camera tilts and turns to track your movement, it feels more fragile than other options and we don't recommend it for travel. Deal matches low.Read the reviewThe Best WebcamsPosted 2 hours agoCopy linkEditRunner-upAqara Temperature and Humidity Sensor$16 $20 Save $4Buy from Amazon What we like: Our runner-up temperature sensor pick from our guide to the best smart sensors. Affordable and offers best-in-class temperature responsiveness (nearly real-time). Has an especially compact design. Native Apple Home support. Other things to know: Compatible with Amazon Alexa, Apple Home, Google Home, and Samsung SmartThings. A little more challenging, and more convoluted, than our Tapo top pick. Requires a branded hub (which is not included).Read the reviewThe Best Smart SensorsPosted 2 hours agoCopy linkEditTop pickMzoo Sleep Mask$10 $23 Save $13Buy from Amazon With clipped on-page coupon (deal on black)What we like: Our top padded, contoured sleep mask pick. Soft, adjustable, and comfortable. Drops the world into complete darkness as soon as you put it on. Goggle-like design keeps a little space between the mask and a wearer's eyes. Stays put all night. Best for side- and back-sleepers. Other things to know: Also recommended in our travel gear guide. Compression of memory foam isn't for everyone, as it puts some pressure on orbital bone and eye socket. Hand-wash only. Deal price for the black color with clipped on-page coupon.Read the reviewThe Best Sleep MaskPosted 3 hours agoCopy linkEditUpgrade pickApple iPad Air (11-Inch, M3, 128 GB)$450 $525 Save $75Buy from Target Buy from Amazon What we like: Our upgrade tablet pick. Delivers iPad Pro power without the iPad Pro price. Same powerful M3 processor as the last-gen MacBook Air. FaceTime camera is great for work calls. Compatible with Apple’s more full-featured accessories. Linking a mouse, keyboard, and monitor unlocks a macOS-like desktop. Other things to know: Also our budget pro tablet pick. We found a much larger difference between the iPad Air’s display and the iPad Pro’s display than we did between that of the Air and that of the entry-level iPad. Solid 128 GB base storage.Read the reviewThe iPad Is the Best TabletPosted 17 hours agoCopy linkEditBest for...Cordinate Décor Extension Cord with 3 Grounded Outlets$10 $14 Save $4Buy from Walmart With store pickupWhat we like: Our extension cord pick best for low-power indoor use.

Easy to set up. Provides 2K HD resolution. Offered the best image quality of any webcam we tested under $70. Has a switch to use the privacy screen.

Delivers a superb blend of functionality and looks, offering both a standard reflection and a magnifying attachment. Highly adjustable, offering three dimmable light temperatures and a choice of two views. Has a long-lasting, rechargeable battery. Other things to know: It’s not cheap (even on sale). Doesn’t come with a wall charger, just a cable, but it's compatible with most USB-A wall chargers. Requires some assembly. Shuts off automatically after 30 minutes. Deal price with promo code FALL.Read the reviewThe Best Lighted Makeup MirrorsPosted 3 days agoCopy linkEditGift pickEnno Vatti National Parks Scratch-Off Poster$14 $17 Save $3Buy from Amazon What we like: An outdoor bucket list gift pick for retirees. This handsome poster of the United States’ 63 national parks—from Acadia to Zion—lets adventurers scratch off each locale they’ve visited. Reveals vintage-style illustrations. Other things to know: 16-by-20-inches. For a winning pairing, gift this poster alongside the National Parks and Federal Recreational Lands Pass that's also recommended in our retirement gift guide.Read the reviewThe 29 Best Retirement GiftsPosted 3 days agoCopy linkEditBest forFirst Alert SM210 10-Year Sealed Battery Smoke Alarm with Slim Profile Design$24 $30 Save $6Buy from Amazon What we like: The best basic smoke alarm for locations with a 10-year battery requirement. Built to the most recent UL standards. Has a fully sealed 10-year lithium-ion battery. Offers the same smoke-sensing effectiveness as our other picks. Offers a higher degree of tamper resistance. Other things to know: Can’t interconnect like our other picks. Research has shown that 10-year batteries may not actually last 10 years and still requires testing on a regular basis. Not the lowest price we've seen, but the street price has risen by a few bucks since the beginning of the year.Read the reviewThe Best Basic Smoke AlarmPosted 3 days agoCopy linkEditBest for...Tubbs Xplore Women’s Snowshoes$97 $130 Save $33Buy from Sportsman's Warehouse What we like: The best snowshoes for powder or if you weigh more than 180 pounds. Longer length design than our top pick helps keep you afloat on top of the snowpack. Robust and secure boot-attachment system and steel spikes underfoot. Other things to know: Not as great an attachment system fit as our top pick. Lacks a heel lift. Available in 21-inch and 25-inch sizes.Read the reviewThe Best SnowshoesPosted 3 days agoCopy linkWirecutterWirecutter is the product recommendation service from The New York Times.
