Powerful suction comparable to models twice as expensive. Creates a secure double seal with vacuum-sealer bags, and can also seal things like chip bags (though the vacuum function won’t work). Simple, streamlined design. Controls are useful and intuitive. Features a bag storage slot and accessory port. Other things to know: Machine automatically stops if you open the lid. Can’t seal liquids in bags. If liquid works its way into the vacuum-chamber channel, you’ll have to clean it out manually. It’s loud, about the same noise level as a vacuum cleaner.Read the reviewThe Best Vacuum SealerPosted less than 1 hour agoCopy linkEditBest for...Too Faced Better Than Sex Volumizing Mascara$15 $29 Save $14Buy from Ulta With store pickupWhat we like: The best vampy, dramatic mascara. Rich, structured formula. Curvy fibrous brush leaves lashes full at the base and defined at the tips. Great longevity. One coat gives a natural boost; extra coats intensify lashes without looking heavy or goopy. Other things to know: Chunky brush can be unwieldy. Some testers noticed a touch of under-eye smudging after a full day of wear (but not full-on raccoon circles). We've seen better per-tube prices, especially on holiday two-packs, but this is a good deal if you need mascara now. To avoid shipping fees, choose store pickup or add to a larger order. A two-pack is also on sale at Amazon.Read the reviewThe Best MascaraPosted less than 1 hour agoCopy linkEditTop pickInstant Pot Duo Mini 3-Quart Electric Pressure Cooker$45 $80 Save $35Buy from Amazon What we like: Our top pick for the best small electric pressure cooker for college dorms. One of the most affordable electric cookers we tried. Makes the perfect amount for one to two people. Easy to store in a small kitchen. Makes hands-off cooking easy. Other things to know: The smallest version of our former top electric pressure cooker pick. Don’t expect to get a week’s worth of leftovers from any meals you prepare in this.Read the reviewThe Best College Dorm EssentialsPosted less than 1 hour agoCopy linkEditTop pickCuisinart CDF-200 Deep Fryer$56 $110 Save $54Buy from Amazon What we like: Our top deep fryer pick. Consistently produced perfectly crunchy, golden-brown food in our tests. Reliable thermostat maintains set oil temperature. Features clearly labeled temperature-control dial, wind-up 30-minute timer, and spacious frying basket. Ideal for frying lots of food or as a standalone machine for parties. Other things to know: None of the deep fryers we tested could maintain a set temperature as well as a pot of oil over a gas range. Lid window is pretty useless. Has a lot of parts that require cleaning.Read the reviewThe Best Deep FryerPosted less than 1 hour agoCopy linkEditTop pickBaby Jogger City Mini GT2 All-Terrain Stroller$300 $400 Save $100Buy from Amazon (deal on black)What we like: Our rugged, all-terrain stroller top pick in our guide for the best full-size strollers. A three-wheeled stroller that’s excellent at taking on tricky terrain. Sturdy and wide with adjustable handlebar and larger wheels with all-wheel suspension. Very light and simple to fold one-handed. Has the longest toddler seat of any of our upcoming picks. Other things to know: Uses a hand brake that's somewhat inconvenient. Skimpy storage. Non-reversible seat. Lifetime warranty for frame defects, and limited one-year warranty for the sseat fabric and other components, with the exception of the tires. Policy does not cover normal wear and tear or accidental damage. Deal on black.Read the reviewThe Best Full-Size StrollersPosted less than 1 hour agoCopy linkEditTop pickCuisinart CPK-17P1 PerfecTemp Cordless Electric Kettle$51 $59 Save $8Buy from Amazon What we like: Our top electric kettle pick. Has been our top pick since 2013 because of its consistent performance and easy-to-use interface. Little variation in the amount of time it takes to boil a full kettle of water (1.7 L). Great accuracy in holding water at a set temperature. Other things to know: Cuisinart warranty. Some reviewers complain that button labels wear off over time and that the kettle breaks within a year or two, but we don't think these are widespread problems.Read the reviewThe Best Electric KettlePosted less than 1 hour agoCopy linkEditanother good optionAnker 555 USB-C Hub (8-in-1)$36 $50 Save $14Buy from Anker Use promo code ANKERWIRECUTTER1What we like: Another good option if you prefer a name-brand USB hub. A solid option with two USB-A ports and support for a single 4K 60 Hz monitor. In our tests those ports worked as well as expected. Can be used at your desk full-time. Small enough to take on the go. Other things to know: Our previous top pick. Sells for less than our new top pick from Baseus but has cheaper-feeling plastic enclosure and fewer ports. The two side-by-side USB-A ports are somewhat cramped. Gets hot during use, but not to a dangerous level. Use code ANKERWIRECUTTER1 to get the deal price.Read the reviewThe Best USB HubsPosted 18 hours agoCopy linkEditTop pickGorilla Grip Cat Litter Trapping Mat (Large)$15 $20 Save $5Buy from Amazon What we like: Our top pick for the best cat litter mat. Traps fine-grain scattered litter particles well. More comfortable for cat paws than most other mats we tested. Less likely to skid across a hardwood floor. Comes in over a dozen colors and seven sizes. Other things to know: Tight coils on mat's surface make it harder to clean gunk and liquid than most others we tested. We've seen a few reviews complaining of durability and lack of skid resistance. Recurring deal is for the large size (35-by-23-inch) in gray.Read the reviewThe Best Cat Litter MatPosted 20 hours agoCopy linkEditBest for...Kitsch Rice Water Shampoo Bar for Hair Growth$11 $14 Save $3Buy from Amazon What we like: The best solid shampoo bar for most hair types. Lathers and rinses easily. Made with only eight ingredients. Leaves hair clean, soft, and moisturized, but not weighed down. Citrusy fragrance is pleasant but not overbearing. Grooved S shape makes bar less slippery. Other things to know: None of our testers experienced extra hair growth, nor did we expect any to. Not moisturizing enough for everyday use on curly strands. Contains added fragrance, which some people avoid due to health concerns, such as migraines.Read the reviewOur Favorite Solid Shampoo BarsPosted 21 hours agoCopy linkEditBudget pickEufy Robovac 11S Max Robot Vacuum (Refurbished)$79 $130 Save $51Buy from eBay (refurbished) What we like: Our budget robot vacuum pick available refurbished. Quiet, nimble, and affordable. Best for small spaces with bare floors and short-pile rugs. Rarely gets stuck. A basic, bump-and-run bot. Comes with a remote control for scheduling it to clean and directing it to missed spots. Other things to know: Doesn't seem built to last for more than a couple of years, and we’ve heard about unrepairable breakdowns that happen sooner. Struggles with debris in rugs, especially softer, thicker types. Anker-certified refurbished. Two-year Allstate warranty. This model will soon be phased out by Roborock, but this is a good deal for those not seeking the latest model.Read the reviewThe Best Robot VacuumPosted 21 hours agoCopy linkEditStaff pick‎Anker 548 Power Bank$80 $115 Save $35Buy from Amazon What we like: A staff-pick portable charger that’s also a lantern, from our guide to cheap(ish) solar lights for home. Shaped like an ordinary lantern, but has two USB-C ports, two USB-A ports, a solar input port, and a built-in battery that can charge both a laptop and phone. Easy-to-read LED display. Lamp is collapsible when not in use. Other things to know: You'll have to supply your own wall charger or solar panel (this comes with USB-C charging cable). Rated capacity of 192 watt-hours, higher than our portable laptop charger picks. Lantern has two brightness levels and a flashing emergency mode. Was $5 lower during Prime Day, but still a good deal.Read the review5 Cheap(ish) Solar Lights to Brighten Your HomePosted 21 hours agoCopy linkEditBest for...Evelyn Bobbie Defy Bra$65 $98 Save $33Buy from Evelyn Bobbie Use promo code WIRECUTTER25What we like: The best supportive wireless bralette for larger breasts. Creates smooth contours, with high-back design, seamless edges, and removable molded cups. Soft enough for lounging and supportive enough for active days. Inclusive (and surprisingly spot-on) sizing. Other things to know: Not the cutest, and not ideal for low-cut or strappy tops. Some testers found it too hot and stifling. Not the easiest to pull on. Removable cups may slip out in the wash. Sizes S to 3XL (C to K cup, 30- to 52-inch band). Use code WIRECUTTER25.Read the reviewThe Best, Most Comfortable BrasPosted 23 hours agoCopy linkEditTop pickCB2 Pavo Double Floor Lamp$400 $500 Save $100Buy from CB2 With store pickupWhat we like: Our top pick for a statement floor lamp that does double duty. A striking two-in-one lamp. The downward-facing lamp swivels and pivots, so it’s ideal for reading. The upward-facing shade provides indirect light for the rest of the room. Made of sturdy materials that have held up well in our long-term tests. Other things to know: The lamps don’t operate independently. The heavy base prevents the lamp from tipping over, but the poles wiggle a little. Prone to fingerprints. Choose store pickup to avoid shipping fees. Read the reviewThe Best Floor LampsPosted 23 hours agoCopy linkEditUpgrade pickApple MacBook Air (15-Inch, M4, 2025, 16 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD)$1000 $1050 Save $50Buy from Amazon Buy from Best Buy What we like: Our upgrade MacBook pick. The bigger sibling to our top pick, with a larger screen, larger touchpad, and better speakers. With the latest M4 processor, it also keeps cooler and performs better than the 13-inch version during long, intensive tasks like exporting large videos. Sports an upgraded 12-megapixel webcam. Other things to know: Has the same two USB-C Thunderbolt 4 ports, MagSafe port, and headphone jack as its smaller sibling. Street price has dropped significantly since release.Read the reviewThe Best MacBooksPosted 24 hours agoCopy linkEditTop pickApple MacBook Air (13-Inch, M4, 2025, 16 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD)$800 $900 Save $100Buy from Amazon Buy from Best Buy What we like: Our top pick for the best MacBook. Sleek design and an upgraded 12-megapixel webcam. Fast enough for most people, even those who want to code or edit 4K video footage. Has a bright, high-resolution display, a comfortable keyboard and trackpad. Comes with two Thunderbolt 4 USB-C ports, a headphone jack, and a MagSafe port. Other things to know: Can power two external displays. Comes with our recommended specs of 16 GB RAM and 256 GB SSD. We recommend using an external drive or cloud storage rather than spending more for extra internal storage. Deal on all colors.Read the reviewThe Best MacBooksPosted 1 day agoCopy linkEditTop pickFintie Carrying Case for Nintendo Switch 2$20 $26 Save $6Buy from Amazon What we like: Our top pick for an affordable slim case for the Nintendo Switch 2. Outside has a sturdy hard shell with raised panels on the front cover. Effectively prevented us from pushing the Switch’s joysticks down through the case when it was closed. Inner compartment has a mesh zipper pocket that fits the charger and a couple of Joy-Cons. Other things to know: Best if you don't need to take many accessories with you. Separate inner flap holds up to 10 game cards. Several colors on sale.Read the reviewThe Best Nintendo Switch and Switch Lite AccessoriesPosted 1 day agoCopy linkEditUpgrade pickInsta360 Link 2 Webcam$150 $200 Save $50Buy from Best Buy What we like: Our upgrade webcam pick. Provided the best balance of image quality, white balance, and subject tracking. 4K video resolution with solid automatic white balance and exposure control right out of the box. Nifty hand-gesture-activated smart features. Other things to know: Because camera tilts and turns to track your movement, it feels more fragile than other options and we don't recommend it for travel. Deal matches low.Read the reviewThe Best WebcamsPosted 1 day agoCopy linkEditRunner-upAqara Temperature and Humidity Sensor$16 $20 Save $4Buy from Amazon What we like: Our runner-up temperature sensor pick from our guide to the best smart sensors. Affordable and offers best-in-class temperature responsiveness (nearly real-time). Has an especially compact design. Native Apple Home support. Other things to know: Compatible with Amazon Alexa, Apple Home, Google Home, and Samsung SmartThings. A little more challenging, and more convoluted, than our Tapo top pick. Requires a branded hub (which is not included).Read the reviewThe Best Smart SensorsPosted 1 day agoCopy linkWirecutterWirecutter is the product recommendation service from The New York Times.
