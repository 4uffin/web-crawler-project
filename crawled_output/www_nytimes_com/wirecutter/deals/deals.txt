Sturdy, but not stiff (they're soft enough to wear while driving). Offer some of the best traction on firm ice that we’ve tested, plus they meet our warmth requirements and are waterproof. Other things to know: Our former pick for walking on ice. More hiking-specific than our current picks. Cuff height is shorter than ideal for deep snow. Our testers found them aesthetically versatile, but they do give off an outdoorsy look. Deal for the gray color. Free Danner membership required for free shipping.Read the reviewThe Best Winter BootsPosted 5 hours agoCopy linkEditBudget pickOXO Brew Conical Burr Coffee Grinder$77 $100 Save $23Buy from Amazon (deal on silver)What we like: Our budget pick for the best coffee grinder. Great for daily drip or French press coffee drinkers. Best model we tested in its price range. Features a simple timer and 12-ounce hopper that can be easily removed, even when loaded with beans. Other things to know: Less repairable than our picks. Grind isn't as even or fine as some of our other picks. Two-year warranty. Not cheap, but offers a nice balance of convenience, quality, and price. Deal on silver. Read the reviewThe Best Coffee GrinderPosted 8 hours agoCopy linkEditBest forHohem iSteady V3 Gimbal$103 $129 Save $26Buy from Amazon What we like: The best gimbal for when you need to be farther from your phone. Features a compact design that extends when needed, as well as a built-in tripod. Includes a removable fill light that draws power from the gimbal. Effective stabilization. Other things to know: Lacks the 360-degree rotation of our top pick, nor does its app have as many features. Battery life is slightly longer than our top pick.Read the reviewThe Best Android and iPhone GimbalPosted 8 hours agoCopy linkEditgift pickDiptyque Roses Extra-Large Candle$344 $430 Save $86Buy from Bluemercury Price reflects in cartWhat we like: Our most luxurious (and pricey) gift pick for someone who also loves the aroma of roses. Made by hand from a blend of waxes and fragrances taken from nature. Smells like taking a walk through an English rose garden without the cloying, overpowering artificial floral odor you get with many scented candles. Other things to know: Designed for indoor and outdoor use. Has five wicks and a burn time of 120 hours. The pink terra-cotta vessel is also handmade, and designed to be reused once the candle is gone. Comes gift-ready in a Diptyque hat box. Price reflects in cart.Read the reviewWirecutter’s 32 Most Luxurious (and Pricey) GiftsPosted 8 hours agoCopy linkEditStaff pickGehwol Wooden Pedicure File$22 $26 Save $4Buy from Nordstrom What we like: A staff pick grooming tool we love. Ergonomic and durable. Each use feels like a pedicure, and it takes only a few seconds on each foot to work its magic. The wooden handle is comfortable to hold. Waterproof. Other things to know: Expensive, but worth it. 10.5 inches long. Made in Switzerland.Read the reviewBathroom Accessories and Grooming Tools We LovePosted 8 hours agoCopy linkEditTop pickShark CryoGlow LED Face Mask$280 $350 Save $70Buy from Shark Use promo code SHARK20What we like: Our top pick for the best comfy and customizable hard red-light mask. Multistasks with LED treatments for aging and acne-prone skin, and has cold panels for under-eye puffiness. Two straps adjust for a custom fit. Remote control is intuitive and clear, and keeps track of your sessions. The red lights have an irradiance on the high side of what the dermatologists we spoke with recommended. Other things to know: The internal fan that whirs when the eye-cooling pads are on is noisy. Its clunkiness gets in the way of portability. To charge, you have to plug in the entire mask. Use code SHARK20 to get the deal.Read the reviewThe Best Red-Light DevicePosted 9 hours agoCopy linkEditUpgrade pickBlueair Blue Pure 211i Max Air Purifier$200 $280 Save $80Buy from Blueair Use promo code 211WCWhat we like: Our upgrade pick for the best air purifier. Stellar performance for large spaces around 500 square feet. Reduced smoke levels in our test room by more than 99.9 percent on its high and high-medium settings. Has air an quality sensor, child lock controls, and a display shutoff option, plus an app for more features. Other things to know: The relatively high price is backed up by the performance, but this much purifier is overkill for medium and small rooms. Filters have a shorter replacement cycle than many of our other picks, at six to nine months (versus a typical year). Use code 211WC.Read the reviewThe Best Air PurifierPosted 9 hours agoCopy linkEditgift pickKate McLeod Daily Stone Solid Moisturizer$41 $48 Save $7Buy from Nordstrom What we like: A solid moisturizer bar we recommend as a gift. Formulated with cocoa butter plus almond, apricot, avocado, and coconut oils to keep skin supple and glowing, yet not greasy. Smooth, stone-like orb feels great in hand. Softens and melts when it meets the heat of skin. Other things to know: A splurge, even on sale. Starter kit comes with a reusable glide-top bamboo canister for storage. Deal is for the Daily Stone unscented bar starter kit, but all scents and sizes are discounted. A solid deal that's a bit short of what we expect to see in December sales, but this product has also seen a recent price increase.Read the reviewThe 23 Best Self-Care Gifts to Buy YourselfPosted 9 hours agoCopy linkEditGift pickKate Mcleod Sleep Pebble Tray$36 $42 Save $6Buy from Nordstrom What we like: A gift pick we like for people who love to sleep. Each pebble dissolves in a warm bath to release a hydrating blend of cocoa seed butter and jojoba, baobab, and kukui oils, plus a mellow, lavender-forward scent. The slide-out box tray is a joy. Other things to know: These can be used on skin in the shower, too. We found the lavender scent isn't heady or obtrusive. Box of 20. The list price has increased by $4 recently; we expect to see better deals in December, but this is a decent price if you want to grab a set now.Read the review14 Gifts for People Who Love to SleepPosted 9 hours agoCopy linkEditTop pickElvie Pump Wearable Breast Pump (Double)$385 $480 Save $95Buy from Elvie What we like: Our top pick the best wearable breast pump. Lightweight, effective, easy to use, and made from higher-quality components. Gentle suction pattern. Easy to transfer milk without spills. Allows you to pump from anywhere—quietly and fairly discreetly—without having to change out of your normal bra. Elvie offers great customer support across all channels. Other things to know: Double the cost of many traditional electric pumps. Some online reviews report that the pump can leak at its central connection point, though we didn't have this issue. Limited warranty covers the original purchaser for two years for the main unit and 90 days for the components and any accessories. Deal for the double pump.Read the reviewThe Best Wearable Breast PumpsPosted 9 hours agoCopy linkEditTop pickRumpl Original Puffy Blanket$72 $100 Save $28Buy from Rumpl Use promo code WCPUFFY72What we like: Our top puffy blanket pick. Plush construction, warm fill, and strong materials. Solidly built and cozy. Wipes down easily, dries quickly, repels dirt, and is easy to throw in the wash. Synthetic fill also stays warm even when it gets wet. Weighs only 2 pounds and fits into a convenient roll-top stuff sack. Other things to know: Not the most water-resistant of the blankets we tested, but does a good job shrugging off spills. Bulkier than our budget pick and harder to wear as a cape. Covered by a one-year warranty. Use code WCPUFFY72.Read the reviewThe Best Puffy BlanketPosted 9 hours agoCopy linkEditTop pickArne Jacobson Station Alarm Clock$104 $130 Save $26Buy from The Container Store Price reflects in cartWhat we like: Our top pick for the best classy yet casual alarm clock. Timeless design features a sturdy aluminum base with gold finish. Touch sensitive; functions include a tap to snooze function. Doesn’t emit a shrill high-pitched beep like other analog models. Other things to know: You'll need nimble fingers and a firm grip to adjust the settings. In a silent room, you can hear a slight noise. Comes in five colors. Requires two AA batteries (not included). Two-year limited warranty. Price reflects in cart.Read the reviewThe Best Alarm ClocksPosted 10 hours agoCopy linkEditStaff pickShark Flexstyle Multipurpose Styling Tool$176 $270 Save $94Buy from Shark Choose three accessories and use promo code SHARK20What we like: Wirecutter's favorite multipurpose hairstyling tool. A powerful hair dryer, straightener, and curler. Essentially eliminates the need for a separate hair dryer. Uses Coanda airflow technology. Dries hair just as fast, and is an overall a better value than the Dyson Airwrap. Base can twist 90 degrees. Other things to know: The Dyson Airwrap is easier to use. Storage box not included. Two-year warranty. Eight accessory and attachment options available; select three. We've seen other drops to $200 for bundles with five attachments, but this is still a good value. Use code SHARK20 to get the deal.Read the reviewShark FlexStyle or Dyson Airwrap: Which Styling Tool Is for You?Posted 10 hours agoCopy linkEditBest for...Jenny Patinkin Sustainable Luxury Powder/Bronzer Brush$34 $40 Save $6Buy from Nordstrom What we like: The best bronzer and powder makeup brush. Has sophisticated, grippy matte bristles and a pretty metallic handle with a satisfying heft. Dome head is silky-soft and fluffy, with an elegant taper. The entire brush is made of recycled materials. Other things to know: Performs perfectly, whether you want just a whisper of powder or a sharper look. Pricey, and may not be in everyone's budget.Read the reviewThe Best Makeup BrushesPosted 10 hours agoCopy linkEditTop pickShark FlexBreeze Outdoor & Indoor Fan$100 $180 Save $80Buy from Shark Buy from Amazon What we like: Our top pick for the best cordless fan. Offers a wide range of power settings and actually useful oscillation settings. Works as pedestal or tabletop fan. Surprisingly quiet. Comes with 4,000 mAh battery that runs for 4-6 hours. Comes with misting attachment in case you want to use it during the summer. Other things to know: Strong magnetic remote control sticks to back of fan for convenient storage. Cleaning process is frustrating, but at least it can be disassembled (not true for all fans). Battery life could be better. Available in white or gray.Read the reviewThe Best Cordless FansPosted 10 hours agoCopy linkEditNew LowTop pickMzoo Sleep Mask$6 $23 Save $17Buy from Amazon (deal on blue)What we like: Our top padded, contoured sleep mask pick. Soft, adjustable, and comfortable. Drops the world into complete darkness as soon as you put it on. Goggle-like design keeps a little space between the mask and a wearer's eyes. Stays put all night. Best for side- and back-sleepers. Other things to know: Also recommended in our travel gear guide. Compression of memory foam isn't for everyone, as it puts some pressure on orbital bone and eye socket. Hand-wash only. Lowest price we've seen. Deal price for the blue color.Read the reviewThe Best Sleep MaskPosted 11 hours agoCopy linkEditStaff pickHero Cosmetics Mighty Patch Original Patch (144-Count, FINAL SALE)$20 $44 Save $24Buy from MorningSave FINAL SALE, use promo code FSDEALS, with delayed shippingWhat we like: A quick pimple remedy from our drugstore beauty guide. Also recommended as a stocking stuffer gift. Round, translucent hydrocolloid stickers help heal zits and prevent below-the-surface pimples from erupting by absorbing fluid and protecting blemishes from bacteria. Other things to know: Also useful if you have trouble keeping your hands off a pimple. Not as fun as cuter, more sticker-y options out there, but very effective. Deal for 144 patches with 02/20/2026 expiration date. FINAL SALE with delayed shipping. Click the price to add to cart and use code FSDEALS.Read the reviewThe Best Drugstore Makeup, Skin Care, and Other Beauty ProductsPosted 11 hours agoCopy linkEditTop pickBoy Smells Hinoki Fantôme Candle$33 $44 Save $11Buy from Bloomingdale's Free Bloomingdale's Loyallist account requiredWhat we like: One of our top warm, woodsy scented candle picks that we also like as a gift. Earthy and elegant fragrance isn't overpowering. Top note of Japanese cypress (hinoki) smoke with hints of warm amber, sweet vanilla, florals, and fresh moss. Handsome black glass jar. Burn time was about 55 hours in our tests. Other things to know: After a rebrand, the company is using a new, supposedly stronger-scented wax formulation; if you loved the original, this new version looks a bit different and smells slightly sweeter, but we still think still smells nice. Not the best deal we've seen, but still solid. Free Bloomingdale's Loyallist account required.Read the reviewOur Favorite Scented CandlesPosted 11 hours agoCopy linkWirecutterWirecutter is the product recommendation service from The New York Times.
