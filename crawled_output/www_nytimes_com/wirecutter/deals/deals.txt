Formulated with proven hydrators like glycerin, sodium hyaluronate, and hyaluronic acid. Rubbery algae sheet mask cools and aids absorption. Stays put even while you sip your coffee. Other things to know: You will look like a member of the Blue Man Group for the 30-40 minutes you need to leave this mask on. Has a two-step application process: first apply the ampoule (serum) to skin, then put on the sheet mask. Free Sephora Beauty Insider membership is required for free shipping.Read the reviewSheet Masks Don’t Do Very Much. We Love These Anyway.Posted less than 1 hour agoCopy linkEditRunner-upThruNite Archer 2A V3 Flashlight$22 $30 Save $8Buy from Amazon (deal on black neutral white)What we like: Our runner-up flashlight pick. Also recommended as a gift for dads and to stock a go bag. Waterproof and compact (picture a thick Crayola marker). Stands upright on its end; doesn't roll on — or off — flat surfaces. Widest range of brightness settings of any AA-battery-powered model we've tested. Other things to know: Not the absolute brightest option we've tested. Flimsy belt clip. On sale in black neutral white. Not the lowest price we've seen, but within $2.Read the reviewThe Best FlashlightPosted 3 hours agoCopy linkEditNew LowAnother good optionCapresso 560 Infinity Conical Burr Grinder$56 $87 Save $31Buy from Amazon (deal on stainless steel)What we like: Our former budget coffee grinder pick. We still like the Capresso for its finer grinding and small countertop profile. Good alternative to our current budget pick at this price. Other things to know: Not as good at coarse grinding. Available in stainless steel finish. Down to the lowest price we've seen so far.  Read the reviewThe Best Coffee GrinderPosted 3 hours agoCopy linkEditupcoming pickDove Sensitive Beauty Bar (6-Pack)$8 $10 Save $2Buy from Amazon (pack of six) With clipped on-page couponWhat we like: A pick in our upcoming bar soap guide. An iconic soap-free beauty bar. Creates a veil of sheer, silky suds. Neutral pH leaves skin feeling clean and nourished. Testers overwhelmingly favored the feel, effectiveness, and lasting moisture, and liked that it doubled as a facial cleanser. Other things to know: Gets mushy and erodes far more quickly than others; you'll need to store in a well-drained soap dish. Despite being fragrance free, has a slight scent. Fully vegan formula since 2023, but some bars on shelves may still contain animal byproducts. Clip on-page coupon to get deal for a 6-pack.Posted 4 hours agoCopy linkEditanother good optionThermoWorks Smoke Probe Thermometer$57 $106 Save $49Buy from ThermoWorks Use promo code TW1M79G52, price includes $8 shippingWhat we like: Another good wireless probe meat thermometer for grilling. Operates via a wireless receiver. Two channels accommodate multiple probes. Allows you to set the minimum and maximum temperatures for each probe. Maintained wireless connection for an unobstructed distance of 350 feet. Other things to know: Considering how much pricier this model is compared with our top probe thermometer pick (about $30 more even on sale), we think it only makes sense for grilling and smoking enthusiasts. Price includes $8 shipping. Use code TW1M79G52.Read the reviewThe Best Meat ThermometersPosted 4 hours agoCopy linkEditBest for...Acer Aspire 3 15.6" Touchscreen Laptop (A315-24PT-R288, Refurbished)$304 $465 Save $161Buy from eBay (refurbished) What we like: The best touchscreen laptop under $500 available refurbished. Solid AMD Ryzen 5 7520U processor and double the memory of many laptops in this price range. Its 15.6-inch 1920×1080 touchscreen has a matte coating to prevent reflections. Can be opened with one hand. Other things to know: Heavy, at nearly four pounds. Display, keyboard, trackpad, and 8-hour battery life are merely passable. Lots of bloatware (but it's removable). Specs include 16 GB RAM and 1 TB SSD. Two-year warranty.Read the reviewThe Best Cheap Laptops Under $500Posted 5 hours agoCopy linkEditpick accessoryThermacell Mosquito Repellent Refill$14 $20 Save $6Buy from Amazon What we like: A cartridge refill compatible with some of our Thermacell mosquito repeller picks, including the E90 and EX90. Because these cartridges are clear and the repellent is in liquid form, it’s not too difficult to monitor the remaining repellent. Other things to know: Also compatible with our former pick, Thermacell's older Radius models. Deal for one 40-hour refill isn't as good as previous deals per unit we've posted for sets of three.Read the reviewThe Best Mosquito Control Gear for Your Patio or YardPosted 5 hours agoCopy linkEditTop pickRubbermaid Brilliance Pantry Food Storage Containers (16-Cup Set of 3)$30 $35 Save $5Buy from Amazon (16-cup set of three) What we like: Our top dry food storage container pick. A durable, well-sealed plastic container that fits easily in most cabinets. Held up through multiple drop tests and trips through the dishwasher. Stacks neatly and efficiently into cabinets. Easy to scoop and pour from. Lids are completely watertight. Other things to know: Only recommended for storing dry ingredients. If the container hits the floor lid-first, the lid can sometimes pop off. Plastic clasps on the lids require multiple steps to open and close. One-year warranty. Deal for set of three 16-cup containers.Read the reviewThe Best Dry Food Storage ContainersPosted 5 hours agoCopy linkEditBudget pickREI Co-op 650 Down Vest - Women’s$50 $100 Save $50Buy from REI With store pickup or REI membership (deal on olive)What we like: Our budget insulated vest pick. As warm as or warmer than all but our top pick. Half the price of our picks. Stylish and well-constructed. Spacious outer pockets. Comes in a variety of sizes. Ideal for commuting, urban walks, and the occasional outdoor adventure. Repels water well. Packable, durable and made of ethically-sourced down. Other things to know: Zippers aren't as sturdy as our top pick, and may get caught on the fabric. Select store pickup or add to an order of $60 or more to avoid shipping fees. REI members get free shipping. Deal on olive.Read the reviewThe Best Insulated VestPosted 5 hours agoCopy linkEditBest for...Too Faced Better Than Sex Volumizing Mascara$15 $29 Save $14Buy from Ulta With store pickupBuy from Sephora Free Sephora Beauty Insider membership requiredWhat we like: The best vampy, dramatic mascara. Rich, structured formula. Curvy fibrous brush leaves lashes full at the base and defined at the tips. Great longevity. One coat gives a natural boost; extra coats intensify lashes without looking heavy or goopy. Other things to know: Chunky brush can be unwieldy. Some testers noticed a touch of under-eye smudging after a full day of wear (but not full-on raccoon circles). We've seen better per-tube prices, especially on holiday two-packs, but this is a good deal if you need mascara now. To avoid shipping fees at Ulta, choose store pickup or add to a larger order. At Sephora, get free shipping with free Beauty Insider membership. A two-pack is also on sale at Amazon.Read the reviewThe Best MascaraPosted 5 hours agoCopy linkEditTop pickBaby Jogger City Mini GT2 All-Terrain Stroller$300 $400 Save $100Buy from Amazon (deal on black)What we like: Our rugged, all-terrain stroller top pick in our guide for the best full-size strollers. A three-wheeled stroller that’s excellent at taking on tricky terrain. Sturdy and wide with adjustable handlebar and larger wheels with all-wheel suspension. Very light and simple to fold one-handed. Has the longest toddler seat of any of our upcoming picks. Other things to know: Uses a hand brake that's somewhat inconvenient. Skimpy storage. Non-reversible seat. Lifetime warranty for frame defects, and limited one-year warranty for the sseat fabric and other components, with the exception of the tires. Policy does not cover normal wear and tear or accidental damage. Deal on black.Read the reviewThe Best Full-Size StrollersPosted 6 hours agoCopy linkEditanother good optionAnker 555 USB-C Hub (8-in-1)$36 $50 Save $14Buy from Anker Use promo code ANKERWIRECUTTER1What we like: Another good option if you prefer a name-brand USB hub. A solid option with two USB-A ports and support for a single 4K 60 Hz monitor. In our tests those ports worked as well as expected. Can be used at your desk full-time. Small enough to take on the go. Other things to know: Our previous top pick. Sells for less than our new top pick from Baseus but has cheaper-feeling plastic enclosure and fewer ports. The two side-by-side USB-A ports are somewhat cramped. Gets hot during use, but not to a dangerous level. Use code ANKERWIRECUTTER1 to get the deal price.Read the reviewThe Best USB HubsPosted 23 hours agoCopy linkEditTop pickGorilla Grip Cat Litter Trapping Mat (Large)$15 $20 Save $5Buy from Amazon What we like: Our top pick for the best cat litter mat. Traps fine-grain scattered litter particles well. More comfortable for cat paws than most other mats we tested. Less likely to skid across a hardwood floor. Comes in over a dozen colors and seven sizes. Other things to know: Tight coils on mat's surface make it harder to clean gunk and liquid than most others we tested. We've seen a few reviews complaining of durability and lack of skid resistance. Recurring deal is for the large size (35-by-23-inch) in gray.Read the reviewThe Best Cat Litter MatPosted 1 day agoCopy linkEditBest for...Kitsch Rice Water Shampoo Bar for Hair Growth$11 $14 Save $3Buy from Amazon What we like: The best solid shampoo bar for most hair types. Lathers and rinses easily. Made with only eight ingredients. Leaves hair clean, soft, and moisturized, but not weighed down. Citrusy fragrance is pleasant but not overbearing. Grooved S shape makes bar less slippery. Other things to know: None of our testers experienced extra hair growth, nor did we expect any to. Not moisturizing enough for everyday use on curly strands. Contains added fragrance, which some people avoid due to health concerns, such as migraines.Read the reviewOur Favorite Solid Shampoo BarsPosted 1 day agoCopy linkEditBudget pickEufy Robovac 11S Max Robot Vacuum (Refurbished)$79 $130 Save $51Buy from eBay (refurbished) What we like: Our budget robot vacuum pick available refurbished. Quiet, nimble, and affordable. Best for small spaces with bare floors and short-pile rugs. Rarely gets stuck. A basic, bump-and-run bot. Comes with a remote control for scheduling it to clean and directing it to missed spots. Other things to know: Doesn't seem built to last for more than a couple of years, and we’ve heard about unrepairable breakdowns that happen sooner. Struggles with debris in rugs, especially softer, thicker types. Anker-certified refurbished. Two-year Allstate warranty. This model will soon be phased out by Roborock, but this is a good deal for those not seeking the latest model.Read the reviewThe Best Robot VacuumPosted 1 day agoCopy linkEditStaff pick‎Anker 548 Power Bank$80 $115 Save $35Buy from Amazon What we like: A staff-pick portable charger that’s also a lantern, from our guide to cheap(ish) solar lights for home. Shaped like an ordinary lantern, but has two USB-C ports, two USB-A ports, a solar input port, and a built-in battery that can charge both a laptop and phone. Easy-to-read LED display. Lamp is collapsible when not in use. Other things to know: You'll have to supply your own wall charger or solar panel (this comes with USB-C charging cable). Rated capacity of 192 watt-hours, higher than our portable laptop charger picks. Lantern has two brightness levels and a flashing emergency mode. Was $5 lower during Prime Day, but still a good deal.Read the review5 Cheap(ish) Solar Lights to Brighten Your HomePosted 1 day agoCopy linkEditBest for...Evelyn Bobbie Defy Bra$65 $98 Save $33Buy from Evelyn Bobbie Use promo code WIRECUTTER25What we like: The best supportive wireless bralette for larger breasts. Creates smooth contours, with high-back design, seamless edges, and removable molded cups. Soft enough for lounging and supportive enough for active days. Inclusive (and surprisingly spot-on) sizing. Other things to know: Not the cutest, and not ideal for low-cut or strappy tops. Some testers found it too hot and stifling. Not the easiest to pull on. Removable cups may slip out in the wash. Sizes S to 3XL (C to K cup, 30- to 52-inch band). Use code WIRECUTTER25.Read the reviewThe Best, Most Comfortable BrasPosted 1 day agoCopy linkEditTop pickCB2 Pavo Double Floor Lamp$400 $500 Save $100Buy from CB2 With store pickupWhat we like: Our top pick for a statement floor lamp that does double duty. A striking two-in-one lamp. The downward-facing lamp swivels and pivots, so it’s ideal for reading. The upward-facing shade provides indirect light for the rest of the room. Made of sturdy materials that have held up well in our long-term tests. Other things to know: The lamps don’t operate independently. The heavy base prevents the lamp from tipping over, but the poles wiggle a little. Prone to fingerprints. Choose store pickup to avoid shipping fees. Read the reviewThe Best Floor LampsPosted 1 day agoCopy linkWirecutterWirecutter is the product recommendation service from The New York Times.
