Play as the ghost of a haunted house whose purpose is to help others find love. Each day's action points allow you to enjoy adorable meddling and meet-cutes from beyond the grave. Other things to know: In a sense, you play an invisible, overbearing landlord with good intentions; move tenants into vacant rooms in your manor, with the goal of matching them up with other single, compatible housemates. Digital download for PC.Read the review13 Spooky Video Games We Love for HalloweenPosted 8 hours agoCopy linkEditTop pickRubbermaid Brilliance Pantry Food Storage Containers (10-Piece Set)$48 $60 Save $12Buy from Amazon (10-piece) Buy from Target (10-piece) What we like: Our top dry food storage container pick. Durable Tritan plastic containers with a tight seal. Held up through multiple drop tests and trips through the dishwasher. Stack neatly and efficiently into cabinets. Other things to know: Only recommended for storing dry ingredients. Includes two half-cup, two 1.3-cup, two 3.2-cup, one 6.6-cup, one 7.8-cup, one 12-cup, and one 16-cup container with corresponding lids.Read the reviewThe Best Dry Food Storage ContainersPosted 8 hours agoCopy linkEditLightning DealTop pickSoundAsleep Dream Series Air Mattress (Queen)$120 $150 Save $30Buy from Amazon (deal on blue or black)What we like: Our top air mattress pick. One of the most comfortable options we tested. Taller than cheaper models. Built-in pump is quieter than any other motor we tried. Automatic shutoff feature prevents over-inflating or popping. Sheets fit it well. Inflates in about 4 minutes. Excellent customer service and owner satisfaction. Other things to know: Like all air mattresses, there's some creaking and jiggling, which is more noticeable with two sleepers. 500-pound weight limit. Storage bag included. One-year warranty. Deal for the queen size in the blue or black colors.Read the reviewThe Best Air MattressPosted 9 hours agoCopy linkEditNew LowStaff pickHades (Nintendo Switch, Digital Download)$6 $15 Save $9Buy from Nintendo (Nintendo Switch, digital download)What we like: An action-heavy roguelike game beloved by Wirecutter staffers. Play as Zagreus, son of Hades. Fight your way out of the depths of Tartarus. Rich and immersive storytelling, or ignore the story and just enjoy one of the best roguelike games ever made. Other things to know: Different weapons and buffs make each run unique. A “God Mode” makes the game easier after each failed attempt. We're excited to play Hades II next week (release date is currently set for September 25, for PC and Nintendo Switch 2). This is the lowest price we've seen for a digital copy of Hades for the Switch, so it's a great time to pick it up.Read the reviewDon’t Be Scared. Play a Roguelike.Posted 9 hours agoCopy linkEditUpgrade pickApple iPad Air (13-Inch, M3, 128 GB)$650 $700 Save $50Buy from Amazon What we like: The larger version of our budget pro tablet pick that we recommend for a bigger digital canvas. Same powerful M3 processor as the last-gen iPad Pro, plus an improved FaceTime camera. Solid, bright screen. Works with most iPad Pro accessories including the Pencil Pro. Other things to know: More expensive than its predecessor. Doesn’t support Apple's Magic Keyboard. Lacks iPad Pro features like 120 Hz OLED screen and FaceID; unlocks via fingerprint sensor instead. Deal on all colors with 128 GB of storage.Read the reviewThe iPad Is the Best TabletPosted 9 hours agoCopy linkEditupcoming pickamFilm OneTouch Glass Screen Protector for iPhone 17 Pro$5 $9 Save $4Buy from Amazon Use promo code EUZWG92JWhat we like: An upcoming iPhone 17 pro screen protector pick. Quality glass that's hard and covers the entirety of an iPhone’s display. We've been recommending the amFilm OneTouch Glass Screen Protectors for years and the design (other than the size) is unchanged. Other things to know: Still in testing but we're confident this screen protector will remain a pick. Applicator tool isn’t quite as easy to use as that of our top pick (although it’s still far superior to most others). The regular iPhone 17 screen protector is also available on sale. Use code EUZWG92J.Read the reviewThe Best iPhone Screen ProtectorsPosted 9 hours agoCopy linkEditupcoming pickamFilm OneTouch Glass Screen Protector for iPhone 17$5 $9 Save $4Buy from Amazon Use promo code EUZWG92JWhat we like: An upcoming iPhone 17 screen protector pick.

Provides a long-lasting (over 10 days!), foolproof, salon-quality manicure. A full manicure took us only 22 minutes start to finish, including removal of existing nail polish. Other things to know: Only available online or in salons. Comes in a wide range of shades. Expensive, but this deal helps. Kit includes mini bottles of everything needed for the four-step process — nail prep, base coat, top coat, and polish — plus polish thinner. Use code FREESHIP.Read the reviewWe’re in a New Age of Quick-Dry Nail Polish. But They’re Not All Created Equal.Posted 11 hours agoCopy linkEditTop pickEverlane The Dream ’90s Shift Dress (FINAL SALE)$52 $95 Save $43Buy from Everlane FINAL SALE, price includes $8 shippingWhat we like: Our top pick for the best versatile, well-priced black minidress. Simple, fitted A-line cut looks great on lots of bodies. Soft, stretchy double-knit material is especially comfortable. A blank slate that you can layer and accessorize to suit many settings and climates. Other things to know: May be too simple for some tastes — though if you ask us, that’s part of what makes it so versatile. Armholes are cut a bit deep, so a bra with higher sides may show. Might be too “mini” if you’re tall. Sizes XXS to XL. Deal price includes $8 shipping. FINAL SALE.Read the reviewThe Best Little Black DressesPosted 14 hours agoCopy linkEditTop pickCorelle Winter Frost Dinnerware Set (18-Piece, Service for 6)$39 $50 Save $11Buy from Amazon (18-piece set)What we like: Our top pick for the best budget dinnerware set. Tougher than china. Nearly as lightweight as plastic. Comes with impressive three-year warranty. Stacks compactly. Other things to know: Made of Vitrelle (a proprietary type of durable glass laminate) and has a noticeable green hue. This collection includes only plates and bowls. Some testers thought this set didn’t seem “grown-up” or sophisticated enough for hosting. 18-piece set serves six.Read the reviewThe Best Dinnerware SetsPosted 14 hours agoCopy linkEditStaff pickFull Circle Tiny Team Mini Brush & Dustpan Set$9 $12 Save $3Buy from The Container Store Price reflects in cart, with store pickupWhat we like: An ever-useful mini brush and dustpan set we like. Makes quick (and adorable) work of sweeping up an abundance of small household messes. Perfect for post-DIY project clean-up, dust bunny extermination, or clearing dry messes off your desk or counters. Other things to know: Too small for cleaning larger spaces like a kitchen floor. Broom doesn’t fit especially snugly into the dustpan, so there’s no satisfying click. Set tends to come apart while in storage. Price reflects in cart when you opt for store pickup.Read the reviewMy Partner Thinks My Mini Dustpan and Broom Set Is Pointless. I Think It’s Perfect.Posted 14 hours agoCopy linkEditBest for...Iuga FlexTight High Waist Tummy Control Leggings with Pockets$20 $25 Save $5Buy from Amazon What we like: The best leggings for under $25. Fit and felt better than other leggings we tried in the same price range. Soft, comfy, and generally flattering cut. Gentle but supportive compression. Functional, convenient pockets. Other things to know: Some may find the one-inch elastic waistband to be constricting. A little loose at the ankle for some testers. We found that the fabric lost its shape a bit over time. Recurring deal price. On sale in several colors.Read the reviewThe Best Leggings for Workouts and Everyday WearPosted 15 hours agoCopy linkEditTop pickEmbark Breed + Health DNA Test$118 $140 Save $22Buy from Embark Select Breed + Health Test, use promo code WIRECUTTER What we like: Our top dog DNA test pick. Comprehensive database of more than 350 breeds. Screens for more than 200 genetic health conditions and traits, and twice as many genetic markers as the competition. Reliable customer service. Other things to know: The company says its breed results are 95% to 99% accurate. No government oversight of the industry, so tests aren’t independently verified. Select the Breed + Health Test and use code WIRECUTTER at checkout.Read the reviewThe Best Dog DNA TestPosted 16 hours agoCopy linkEditTop pickApple Mac Mini (M4, 2024, 24 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD)$700 $800 Save $100Buy from B&H (24 GB RAM) What we like: Our top pick for best mini desktop PC. Tiny and powerful. Operates silently without fans. USB-C ports on the front make it even more desk-friendly. M4 processor is fast enough to compile code or do some light video editing. More ports than a MacBook and great for everyday tasks. Other things to know: Just five inches wide. You need your own monitor, mouse, and keyboard. Memory and storage can't be upgraded after purchase. Comes with more than our recommended specs with 24 GB of RAM, but you'll likely still need an external hard drive.Read the reviewThe Best Mini Desktop PCsPosted 16 hours agoCopy linkEditStaff pickUni USB-C to HDMI Adapter$10 $13 Save $3Buy from Amazon With clipped on-page couponWhat we like: A staff pick for the best USB-C-to-HDMI adapter. Made of high-end nylon and aluminum materials, it doesn’t take up much room in a bag and comes with a carrying pouch. Supports HDMI 2.0, 4K video at 60 Hz. Other things to know: Not as good for gaming or higher resolution since it doesn't support HDMI 2.1, is limited to 60 Hz refresh rate. Recurring deal. Clip on-page coupon to get deal price.Read the reviewThe Best USB-C Video Cables and AdaptersPosted 1 day agoCopy linkEditRunner-upThruNite Archer 2A V3 Flashlight$22 $30 Save $8Buy from Amazon (deal on black neutral white)What we like: Our runner-up flashlight pick. Also recommended as a gift for dads and to stock a go bag. Waterproof and compact (picture a thick Crayola marker). Stands upright on its end; doesn't roll on — or off — flat surfaces. Widest range of brightness settings of any AA-battery-powered model we've tested. Other things to know: Not the absolute brightest option we've tested. Flimsy belt clip. On sale in black neutral white. Not the lowest price we've seen, but within $2.Read the reviewThe Best FlashlightPosted 2 days agoCopy linkEditupcoming pickDove Sensitive Beauty Bar (6-Pack)$8 $10 Save $2Buy from Amazon (pack of six) With clipped on-page couponWhat we like: A pick in our upcoming bar soap guide. An iconic soap-free beauty bar. Creates a veil of sheer, silky suds. Neutral pH leaves skin feeling clean and nourished. Testers overwhelmingly favored the feel, effectiveness, and lasting moisture, and liked that it doubled as a facial cleanser. Other things to know: Gets mushy and erodes far more quickly than others; you'll need to store in a well-drained soap dish. Despite being fragrance free, has a slight scent. Fully vegan formula since 2023, but some bars on shelves may still contain animal byproducts. Clip on-page coupon to get deal for a 6-pack.Posted 2 days agoCopy linkEditBest for...Acer Aspire 3 15.6" Touchscreen Laptop (A315-24PT-R288, Refurbished)$304 $465 Save $161Buy from eBay (refurbished) What we like: The best touchscreen laptop under $500 available refurbished. Solid AMD Ryzen 5 7520U processor and double the memory of many laptops in this price range. Its 15.6-inch 1920×1080 touchscreen has a matte coating to prevent reflections. Can be opened with one hand. Other things to know: Heavy, at nearly four pounds. Display, keyboard, trackpad, and 8-hour battery life are merely passable. Lots of bloatware (but it's removable). Specs include 16 GB RAM and 1 TB SSD. Two-year warranty.Read the reviewThe Best Cheap Laptops Under $500Posted 2 days agoCopy linkWirecutterWirecutter is the product recommendation service from The New York Times.
