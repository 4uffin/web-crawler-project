Built to the most recent UL standards. Has a fully sealed 10-year lithium-ion battery. Offers the same smoke-sensing effectiveness as our other picks. Offers a higher degree of tamper resistance. Other things to know: Can’t interconnect like our other picks. Research has shown that 10-year batteries may not actually last 10 years and still requires testing on a regular basis.

Decadent, almost plush texture was unanimously loved by our testers. Comfortable and notably well constructed. When on sale, it's a good value if you can find a fit that you like. Other things to know: Fit was somewhat off for multiple testers — the body was too wide for one, and it was too long to wear untucked for another. Comes in five colors, three cuts (classic, slim, and tall), and sizes XS to XXL. Free J.Crew Passport account required. Use code SHOPFALL.Read the reviewThe Best Men’s White T-ShirtsPosted 4 days agoCopy linkEditTop pickOXO Good Grips Pro Swivel Peeler$12 $16 Save $4Buy from Amazon What we like: Our top pick for the best straight swivel peeler.
