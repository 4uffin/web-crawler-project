A solid option with two USB-A ports and support for a single 4K 60 Hz monitor. In our tests those ports worked as well as expected. Can be used at your desk full-time. Small enough to take on the go. Other things to know: Our previous top pick. Sells for less than our new top pick from Baseus but has cheaper-feeling plastic enclosure and fewer ports. The two side-by-side USB-A ports are somewhat cramped. Gets hot during use, but not to a dangerous level. Use code ANKERWIRECUTTER1 to get the deal price.Read the reviewThe Best USB HubsPosted 10 hours agoCopy linkEditLightning DealRunner-upXgimi MoGo 4 Portable Mini Projector$425 $500 Save $75Buy from Amazon What we like: Our runner-up portable mini projector pick if you prefer a more stylish, capsule design. 1080p LED projector with a fun, capsule-shaped design with a rotatable stand. Runs Google TV and has a built-in battery that ran for over 2.5 hours at 50% brightness in our tests. Adds some fun, whimsical features, like colored lights and a supplied sunset filter. Other things to know: Does not match our top pick in picture, sound, or build quality. It had similar brightness, but the contrast was much lower and the black level much higher. Produces notably less bass than our top pick. The gimbal-style stand is more susceptible to damage.Read the reviewThe Best Portable Mini ProjectorPosted 11 hours agoCopy linkEditLightning DealBudget pickEarFun Air Pro 4 Earbuds$52 $68 Save $16Buy from Amazon Use promo code EFPR04AB (deal on black)What we like: Our budget noise-cancelling earbuds pick. Good sound quality. Active noise cancellation is on a par with pricier sets. 11-hour battery life. Customizable touch-based controls. Three sets of microphones deliver clear phone calls, even when it's windy or noisy. Other things to know: May take time to memorize the series of taps and holds necessary to access the full suite of controls. Lacks the clarity and sense of space of our top pick. May not stay in place if you have very small or deep-set ears. Recurring sale for the black color; use code EFPR04AB.Read the reviewThe Best Noise-Cancelling HeadphonesPosted 12 hours agoCopy linkEditTop pickGorilla Grip Cat Litter Trapping Mat (Large)$15 $20 Save $5Buy from Amazon What we like: Our top pick for the best cat litter mat. Traps fine-grain scattered litter particles well. More comfortable for cat paws than most other mats we tested. Less likely to skid across a hardwood floor. Comes in over a dozen colors and seven sizes. Other things to know: Tight coils on mat's surface make it harder to clean gunk and liquid than most others we tested. We've seen a few reviews complaining of durability and lack of skid resistance. Recurring deal is for the large size (35-by-23-inch) in gray.Read the reviewThe Best Cat Litter MatPosted 12 hours agoCopy linkEditBest for...Kitsch Rice Water Shampoo Bar for Hair Growth$11 $14 Save $3Buy from Amazon What we like: The best solid shampoo bar for most hair types. Lathers and rinses easily. Made with only eight ingredients. Leaves hair clean, soft, and moisturized, but not weighed down. Citrusy fragrance is pleasant but not overbearing. Grooved S shape makes bar less slippery. Other things to know: None of our testers experienced extra hair growth, nor did we expect any to. Not moisturizing enough for everyday use on curly strands. Contains added fragrance, which some people avoid due to health concerns, such as migraines.Read the reviewOur Favorite Solid Shampoo BarsPosted 13 hours agoCopy linkEditBudget pickEufy Robovac 11S Max Robot Vacuum (Refurbished)$79 $130 Save $51Buy from eBay (refurbished) What we like: Our budget robot vacuum pick available refurbished. Quiet, nimble, and affordable. Best for small spaces with bare floors and short-pile rugs. Rarely gets stuck. A basic, bump-and-run bot. Comes with a remote control for scheduling it to clean and directing it to missed spots. Other things to know: Doesn't seem built to last for more than a couple of years, and we’ve heard about unrepairable breakdowns that happen sooner. Struggles with debris in rugs, especially softer, thicker types. Anker-certified refurbished. Two-year Allstate warranty. This model will soon be phased out by Roborock, but this is a good deal for those not seeking the latest model.Read the reviewThe Best Robot VacuumPosted 13 hours agoCopy linkEditStaff pick‎Anker 548 Power Bank$80 $115 Save $35Buy from Amazon What we like: A staff-pick portable charger that’s also a lantern, from our guide to cheap(ish) solar lights for home. Shaped like an ordinary lantern, but has two USB-C ports, two USB-A ports, a solar input port, and a built-in battery that can charge both a laptop and phone. Easy-to-read LED display. Lamp is collapsible when not in use. Other things to know: You'll have to supply your own wall charger or solar panel (this comes with USB-C charging cable). Rated capacity of 192 watt-hours, higher than our portable laptop charger picks. Lantern has two brightness levels and a flashing emergency mode. Was $5 lower during Prime Day, but still a good deal.Read the review5 Cheap(ish) Solar Lights to Brighten Your HomePosted 14 hours agoCopy linkEditBudget pickVerilux HappyLight Luxe Light Therapy Lamp$60 $70 Save $10Buy from Amazon What we like: Our budget light therapy lamp pick. Compact and packs well for travel. 9-by-6-inch light surface offers three color temperatures to choose from (more than our top or also great pick). Comes with a useful countdown timer. Other things to know: Significantly lower light output than our other picks. Fixed position can be slightly awkward. Three-year warranty does not cover bulbs and parts. Not the lowest price we've seen. Hoping to see it back to $56 over the next major sales event.Read the reviewThe Best Light Therapy LampPosted 14 hours agoCopy linkEditBest for...Evelyn Bobbie Defy Bra$65 $98 Save $33Buy from Evelyn Bobbie Use promo code WIRECUTTER25What we like: The best supportive wireless bralette for larger breasts. Creates smooth contours, with high-back design, seamless edges, and removable molded cups. Soft enough for lounging and supportive enough for active days. Inclusive (and surprisingly spot-on) sizing. Other things to know: Not the cutest, and not ideal for low-cut or strappy tops. Some testers found it too hot and stifling. Not the easiest to pull on. Removable cups may slip out in the wash. Sizes S to 3XL (C to K cup, 30- to 52-inch band). Use code WIRECUTTER25.Read the reviewThe Best, Most Comfortable BrasPosted 15 hours agoCopy linkEditTop pickCB2 Pavo Double Floor Lamp$400 $500 Save $100Buy from CB2 With store pickupWhat we like: Our top pick for a statement floor lamp that does double duty. A striking two-in-one lamp. The downward-facing lamp swivels and pivots, so it’s ideal for reading. The upward-facing shade provides indirect light for the rest of the room. Made of sturdy materials that have held up well in our long-term tests. Other things to know: The lamps don’t operate independently. The heavy base prevents the lamp from tipping over, but the poles wiggle a little. Prone to fingerprints. Choose store pickup to avoid shipping fees. Read the reviewThe Best Floor LampsPosted 16 hours agoCopy linkEditUpgrade pickApple MacBook Air (15-Inch, M4, 2025, 16 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD)$1000 $1050 Save $50Buy from Amazon Buy from Best Buy What we like: Our upgrade MacBook pick. The bigger sibling to our top pick, with a larger screen, larger touchpad, and better speakers. With the latest M4 processor, it also keeps cooler and performs better than the 13-inch version during long, intensive tasks like exporting large videos. Sports an upgraded 12-megapixel webcam. Other things to know: Has the same two USB-C Thunderbolt 4 ports, MagSafe port, and headphone jack as its smaller sibling. Street price has dropped significantly since release.Read the reviewThe Best MacBooksPosted 16 hours agoCopy linkEditTop pickApple MacBook Air (13-Inch, M4, 2025, 16 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD)$800 $900 Save $100Buy from Amazon Buy from Best Buy What we like: Our top pick for the best MacBook. Sleek design and an upgraded 12-megapixel webcam. Fast enough for most people, even those who want to code or edit 4K video footage. Has a bright, high-resolution display, a comfortable keyboard and trackpad. Comes with two Thunderbolt 4 USB-C ports, a headphone jack, and a MagSafe port. Other things to know: Can power two external displays. Comes with our recommended specs of 16 GB RAM and 256 GB SSD. We recommend using an external drive or cloud storage rather than spending more for extra internal storage. Deal on all colors.Read the reviewThe Best MacBooksPosted 16 hours agoCopy linkEditPick Accessory$50 Nintendo eGift Card$45 $50 Save $5Buy from Newegg Use promo code SSE595What we like: A nice-to-have gift card for owners of a Nintendo Switch, the most flexible pick in our game console guide. Essentially $5 of free money toward your next Nintendo eShop purchase. Keep for yourself or send to someone else as a gift. Wirecutter also has an ever expanding catalog of video game recommendations. Other things to know: Redeemable from a single Nintendo account through the Nintendo eShop on the Nintendo Switch, Wii U, and Nintendo 3DS family of systems. Recurring deal. Non-returnable and non-refundable. Email delivery. Use promo code SSE595.Read the reviewThe Best Nintendo Switch and Switch Lite AccessoriesPosted 17 hours agoCopy linkEditTop pickFintie Carrying Case for Nintendo Switch 2$20 $26 Save $6Buy from Amazon What we like: Our top pick for an affordable slim case for the Nintendo Switch 2. Outside has a sturdy hard shell with raised panels on the front cover. Effectively prevented us from pushing the Switch’s joysticks down through the case when it was closed. Inner compartment has a mesh zipper pocket that fits the charger and a couple of Joy-Cons. Other things to know: Best if you don't need to take many accessories with you. Separate inner flap holds up to 10 game cards. Several colors on sale.Read the reviewThe Best Nintendo Switch and Switch Lite AccessoriesPosted 17 hours agoCopy linkEditUpgrade pickInsta360 Link 2 Webcam$150 $200 Save $50Buy from Amazon Buy from Best Buy What we like: Our upgrade webcam pick. Provided the best balance of image quality, white balance, and subject tracking. 4K video resolution with solid automatic white balance and exposure control right out of the box. Nifty hand-gesture-activated smart features. Other things to know: Because camera tilts and turns to track your movement, it feels more fragile than other options and we don't recommend it for travel. Deal matches low.Read the reviewThe Best WebcamsPosted 17 hours agoCopy linkEditRunner-upAqara Temperature and Humidity Sensor$16 $20 Save $4Buy from Amazon What we like: Our runner-up temperature sensor pick from our guide to the best smart sensors. Affordable and offers best-in-class temperature responsiveness (nearly real-time). Has an especially compact design. Native Apple Home support. Other things to know: Compatible with Amazon Alexa, Apple Home, Google Home, and Samsung SmartThings. A little more challenging, and more convoluted, than our Tapo top pick. Requires a branded hub (which is not included).Read the reviewThe Best Smart SensorsPosted 17 hours agoCopy linkEditTop pickMzoo Sleep Mask$10 $23 Save $13Buy from Amazon With clipped on-page coupon (deal on black)What we like: Our top padded, contoured sleep mask pick. Soft, adjustable, and comfortable. Drops the world into complete darkness as soon as you put it on. Goggle-like design keeps a little space between the mask and a wearer's eyes. Stays put all night. Best for side- and back-sleepers. Other things to know: Also recommended in our travel gear guide. Compression of memory foam isn't for everyone, as it puts some pressure on orbital bone and eye socket. Hand-wash only. Deal price for the black color with clipped on-page coupon.Read the reviewThe Best Sleep MaskPosted 17 hours agoCopy linkEditUpgrade pickApple iPad Air (11-Inch, M3, 128 GB)$450 $525 Save $75Buy from Target Buy from Amazon What we like: Our upgrade tablet pick. Delivers iPad Pro power without the iPad Pro price. Same powerful M3 processor as the last-gen MacBook Air. FaceTime camera is great for work calls. Compatible with Apple’s more full-featured accessories. Linking a mouse, keyboard, and monitor unlocks a macOS-like desktop. Other things to know: Also our budget pro tablet pick. We found a much larger difference between the iPad Air’s display and the iPad Pro’s display than we did between that of the Air and that of the entry-level iPad. Solid 128 GB base storage.Read the reviewThe iPad Is the Best TabletPosted 1 day agoCopy linkWirecutterWirecutter is the product recommendation service from The New York Times.
