We make documentary films, argued video shorts and video guest essays (formerly known as video Op-Eds) that allow voices from outside The Times to speak directly to our audiences. We also acquire and commission videos made by external creators, including filmmakers, animators, YouTubers and studios.
Our department also includes Op-Docs, a series of short documentaries by independent filmmakers around the world.
In 2022 Opinion Video won the first Academy Award for The Times. Since 2021, Opinion Video has won seven news and documentary Emmy Awards and two Peabody Awards, along with 23 Emmy and four Oscar nominations.
Our mission is to convene rich discussion and debate and to help our audience better understand the world. We are a space for people who aren’t journalists and who often have no institutional affiliation with The Times to speak directly to audiences. By design, these arguments and voices often diverge from those of The Times’s Opinion columnists, editorials and Opinion text essays.
