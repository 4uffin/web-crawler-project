Stars have begun arriving at the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles for the 2025 Emmy Awards. Although the Creative Arts Emmys were held on last weekend, the biggest awards are yet to be given out during a live, prime-time ceremony hosted by the comedian Nate Bargatze. With 27 nominations — the most of any show this year — “Severance” is entering in a strong position, but HBO favorites like “The Pitt” and “The White Lotus,” as well as the “Star Wars” spinoff series “Andor,” are also strong contenders for recognition. But before that gets underway, here’s what stars from the year’s buzziest shows wore to walk the red carpet on Sunday. See 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 of 6 Saved Looks
