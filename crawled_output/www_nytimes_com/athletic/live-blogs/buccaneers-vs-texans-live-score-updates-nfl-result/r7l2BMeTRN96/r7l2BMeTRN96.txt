That looked laughably low out of the gate, as the first four drives yielded three touchdowns and a field goal. Four straight punts cooled things off, though, and the adjusted halftime mark got a modest bump up to 44.5 on BetMGM.With a 14-10 lead and the kickoff coming back to them after the break, Baker Mayfield's Bucs are now -160 on the moneyline. A Texans comeback is listed as +130.AdvertisementSeptember 15, 2025 at 8:31 PM EDTLukas Weese·Live Reporter at Flushing MeadowsYour first half viewsBelow are some of your thoughts on the first half between the Houston Texans and Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Chelsea S.: Stroud looks better than he did in Week 1!Abe C.: How many players are going to get hurt? Jeez.Jorge L.: The Baker Mayfield career resurgence is one of the greatest I’ve ever seen.Jim S.: Keep giving it to Bucky, will wear that defense down.John L.: Officials have been killing the Texans.September 15, 2025 at 8:30 PM EDTDaniel Shirley·Senior Editor, LiveBucs’ defense woke up through first halfTampa Bay gave up 10 points and 133 yards on the first two drives, but it woke up after that and kept the Texans off the board the rest of the half. Houston had 42 yards on its next two drives before kneeling out the half.September 15, 2025 at 8:28 PM EDTAustin Green·Live ReporterImpressive from Baker Getty ImagesIs Baker Mayfield underrated?Here’s what he just did in the first half against a Houston defense widely considered one of the best in the NFL:13-for-18 passing109 yardstwo touchdown passesOh, and a 2-yard first down run on a key third-and-1, beating star Texans pass-rusher Will Anderson Jr. to the marker.Not bad!September 15, 2025 at 8:26 PM EDTDaniel Shirley·Senior Editor, LiveRunning game gets going for BucsIt was nice to see the Bucs get the running game going a bit in the first half. Quarterback Baker Mayfield was the team’s leading rusher last week, and that is not sustainable. Bucky Irving has seven carries for 41 yards, and Rachaad White has five carries for 25 yards. The Bucs have 68 yards on 13 carries, an average of 5.2 yards per carry.September 15, 2025 at 8:24 PM EDTLukas Weese·Live Reporter at Flushing MeadowsFirst half stats First downs: Tampa Bay: 12Houston: 7Total plays: Tampa Bay: 32Houston: 23 Total yards: Tampa Bay: 169Houston: 160 Passing yards: Tampa Bay: 101Houston: 123Rushing yards: Tampa Bay: 68Houston: 37 Time of possession: Tampa Bay: 18:42Houston: 11:18AdvertisementSeptember 15, 2025 at 8:21 PM EDTLukas Weese·Live Reporter at Flushing MeadowsHALFTIME: Bucs up 4  Getty ImagesQ2 0:00 - Bucs 14, Texans 10 At the half, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers are up four against the Houston Texans.

September 15, 2025 at 8:17 PM EDTDaniel Shirley·Senior Editor, LiveIt looked like we were headed for a shootout at the start of this game with three touchdowns and a field goal on the first four drives. But the two defenses have come alive, forcing three straight punts, and I would bet the Bucs run out the half after this short break.September 15, 2025 at 8:16 PM EDTLukas Weese·Live Reporter at Flushing MeadowsTexans puntQ2 0:38 - Bucs 14, Texans 10The Texans don’t take advantage coming out of the two-minute warning.

Jalen Pitre, the Texans safety, is questionable to return with a rib injury. September 15, 2025 at 8:02 PM EDTAdam Coleman·Staff Editor, NFL Getty ImagesWhile the opening offensive drive showed promise, they’ve missed opportunities on subsequent drives. C.J. Stroud put his improvisation skills to the test and almost had an open Harrison Bryant for what would’ve been a big gain. But Bryant tripped.On the other end Baker Mayfield, Emeka Egbuka, Mike Evans and Bucky Irving have proven to be a handful for this defense, too. This is where it gets dangerous for the Texans.September 15, 2025 at 8:00 PM EDTDaniel Shirley·Senior Editor, LiveAnother injury for BucsCalijah Kancey was just shown on the broadcast walking gingerly to the locker room.
