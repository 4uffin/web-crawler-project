WHO at the United Nations General Assembly 2025
9 – 28 September 2025
New York, USA
The World Health Organization and partners will raise global awareness during the 80th United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) on progress in addressing a range of critical issues impacting people’s health worldwide, and urgent work that needs to be scaled up.These will include protecting people from noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) like cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, and chronic respiratory diseases; advocating for scale up of mental health services; addressing the common risks caused by tobacco, unhealthy diet, alcohol, physical inactivity and climate change; and finding solutions to raise resources to finance national health systems. Promoting peace as the best medicine to protect health and end conflicts in various parts of the world will also feature prominently during UNGA.On 25 September, the Fourth UNGA High-level Meeting on NCDs and mental health will be held, with the aim of setting a new vision to protect people from the world's leading killers. NCDs account for nearly 75% of all deaths globally, and over a billion people are living with mental health conditions. The WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, is expected to address the opening of this event, joined by leadership of the United Nations, Member States and other key partners.In addition, strategic events held on 24 September, in collaboration with partners, including the
Bloomberg Philanthropies Global Forum, will focus on how pro-health taxes on harmful products such as tobacco can protect people’s health and raise needed resources for national health services. The challenge of the global obesity epidemic will also be a subject of major attention. In addition, WHO will release the Global Hypertension Report during the Assembly, warning that uncontrolled high blood pressure remains one of the world’s leading causes of premature death.This year’s General Assembly takes place at a critical time for the multilateral system as it adapts to a range of new realities. WHO has been working closely with fellow UN agencies, through the UN80 Initiative, to improve efficiencies in its operations while remaining committed to deliver on its mission of advancing health for all.WHO and partners will also be advocating for action to reduce the threats to health that people face worldwide from the impacts of conflicts, such as those in Gaza, Sudan and Ukraine, climate change and diseases such as polio. WHO events at UNGA 8022 September 15:00–17:30 | 20 years of the WHO FCTC – Driving Global Action on Tobacco Control & NCDSCo-organized: WHO FCTC Secretariat, Cancer Research UK, Global Alliance for Tobacco Control, NCD AllianceLocation: Bryant Park Modern Aesthetics Loft Event Space, New York City (15 West 39th Street, New York, NY 10018)Register 22 September 18:00–20:00 | Sustaining joint actions, coherent policies and inclusive programmes on NCDs and mental health: fourth multistakeholder gatheringCo-organized: NCD Alliance, WHO, World Diabetes FoundationMore information 23 September 08:00–09:00 | High blood pressure, high stakes: translating commitment into lifesaving action (launch of WHO hypertension report)Co-organized: WHO, Bloomberg Philanthropies, RESOLVE, Ethiopia, Dominican Republic, Philippines, Republic of Korea, India, Mohammed bin Zayed FoundationRegister | watch live 23 September 17:00–20:00 | Global obesity forum 2025 – for half of humanity: four billion reasons we need urgent action on obesityCo-organized: World Obesity Foundation, WHO, UNICEFRegister 23 September 18:00–20:00 | No health without mental health: a shared commitmentCo-organized: WHO, Antigua and Barbuda, United for Global Mental Health, Wellcome Trust, UNICEFIn-person event 24 September 13:15–14:30 | A global movement to improve survival and reduce suffering for children with cancer and other catastrophic diseasesCo-organized: St Jude, WHO, Uzbekistan, Zamin FoundationRegister | watch on UN Web TV 25 September 13:15–14:30 | High-Level Ministerial Meeting: launch of the Global Autism Advocacy CoalitionCo-organized: Qatar, UNICEF, WHO, Autism SpeaksIn-person event 25 September 10:00–18:00 | the Fourth United Nations General Assembly High-Level Meeting (HLM4) on the prevention and control of NCDs and the promotion of mental health and well-being, under the theme of “Equity and integration: transforming lives and livelihoods through leadership and action on noncommunicable diseases and the promotion of mental health and well-being”More information For real time updates on WHO and global health activities during UNGA, follow WHO and the Director-General’s social media accounts:X: @WHO @DrTedrosFacebook: World Health Organization (WHO) Tedros Adhanom GhebreyesusLinkedIn: World Health Organization Tedros Adhanom GhebreyesusInstagram: @who @drtedrosBlueSky: @who.int @drtedros.who.intThreads: @who @drtedrosTelegram: Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus
