Disabilities from snakebite envenoming:  The Hidden CrisisSnakebite envenoming is a neglected tropical disease affecting poor people in rural communities, particularly people of working age and children. Each year, nearly 5.4 million people are bitten by snakes worldwide, resulting in over 80,000 deaths and leaving three times that number of survivors with disabilities. Prompt administration of antivenoms can save lives and limit the long-term consequences of envenoming. The theme this year is Disabilities from snakebite envenoming.  Disabilities from snakebite envenoming may be:Physical — amputations, infections, pain, disfigurement, impaired mobilityNeurological — paralysis, nerve damage, seizures, cognitive impairmentPsychological — post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, anxietyDisabilities from snakebite envenoming is severely underreported.It is time to call for action to have better estimates and understanding of these disabilities to uncover the true impact of snakebite disabilities and follow up with the victims to make sure their stories are heard.
