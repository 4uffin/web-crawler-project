REPORT WRONGDOING
The World Health Organization saves lives. The work of the Office of Internal Oversight Services (IOS) is vital to this endeavour. Serving as a check on the balance to the projects and programmes WHO implements, IOS ensures that the maximum number of resources supplied to WHO are provided to those in need and are used for their intended purpose. The Office achieves this through the delivery of objective and independent audits and investigations.  Guided by its Charter, IOS may review all systems, processes, operations, functions and activities of WHO to ensure that the Organization operates with efficiency and economy; that its workforce abides by established rules, regulations and code of conduct; and that any credible allegations of misconduct are reported and investigated to ensure that a duty of care is provided to the workforce and those WHO works alongside.  IOS maintains regular contact with WHO departments and collaborates closely with the accountability functions, which further contributes to strengthening the Organization’s corporate values.
