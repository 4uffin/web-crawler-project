Hello.
We bring together funders and high impact health initiatives to further the mission of the World Health Organization (WHO).
About us
How do we achieve this?
We are here to help the World Health Organization and its partners to aid critical health projects across the world – protecting children from disease; helping women to give birth safely in emergencies; and supplying hospitals with essential medicines.
But that’s not all we do. We bring together the people trying to solve the world’s most urgent health challenges with those who are able to fund their work. This funding paves the way for innovations in health technology and more sustainable health systems. All with the single goal of saving more lives, in more places.
