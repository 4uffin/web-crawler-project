Our workWe put science to work to build a healthier, safer worldThe World Health Organization leads and champions global efforts to achieve better health for all. By connecting countries, people and partners, we strive to give everyone, everywhere an equal chance at a safe and healthy life.From emerging epidemics such as COVID-19 and Zika to the persistent threat of communicable diseases including HIV, malaria, Ebola, Marburg and tuberculosis and chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease and cancer, we bring together 194 countries and work on the
frontlines in 150+ locations to confront the biggest health challenges of our time and measurably advance the well-being of the world’s people.
Triple Billion TargetsWHO's agenda for progress
WHO tracks the world’s progress toward the three Triple Billion targets set out in our Thirteenth General Programme of Work (GPW 13), which was extended until 2025. The Fourteenth General Programme of Work (GPW 14), guides WHO’s work in support of Member States and partners for the period 2025–2028. It is expected to reinvigorate actions needed to get the health-related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) back on track, and to help health-care systems prepare to meet the challenges of the future.The new Strategy recognizes that the world has dramatically changed since the adoption of the SDGs, and sets an ambitious agenda for global health in the face of key challenges including climate change, an ageing population, migration and a rapidly changing geopolitical environment, as well as the opportunities afforded by advancing science and technology.
One billion more people benefit from universal health coverage
Good health care is needed at all stages of life. That’s why universal health coverage (UHC) is vital to WHO's efforts to ensure access to health as a human right. Our programmes and partnerships emphasize:access to primary and preventative health care;ensuring access to the medicines and health products that people need;sustainable financing and financial protection for people and communities; andworkforce training and labour protection for health workers.

One billion more people are better protected from health emergencies
WHO plays an essential role supporting countries to prepare for, detect, respond to and recover from health emergencies, including pandemics, disease outbreaks, natural disasters and humanitarian crises. Amid a growing need for rapid response, we build
global systems that:predict, prevent and contain emerging risks;support countries and communities to respond to disease outbreaks, disasters and humanitarian crises;rapidly assess the availability, safety, and efficacy of emergency health products;marshall resources and health services for fair global access to vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics and supplies; andsupport on-the-ground care in fragile settings to protect the most vulnerable.

One billion more people enjoy better health and well-being
Because good health goes beyond treating illness, WHO mobilizes all sectors of society to address the root causes of health problems, promote wellness and address physical, psychosocial and environmental health risks. WHO’s healthier populations target tracks the social and environmental factors that play a pivotal role in shaping health, such as: clean air and water;safe roads;healthy eating and exercise; andviolence and injury prevention.

Key areas of workEvery day, WHO's experts are dedicated to creating a world free from disease and addressing the social conditions that influence human health and well-being. There are six key programmatic divisions at the WHO headquarters that drive action towards the Triple Billion targets.
Universal health coverageCurrently, at least half of the world’s people do not receive the health care they need, and out-of-pocket health care costs push about 100 million into extreme poverty every year. Universal health coverage ensures health as a human right.
LIFE COURSEWHO aims to improve the health and well-being of populations through the life course with a special focus on women, children and adolescents.Life course
