A world in crisis: confronting the drivers of health emergencies
Increasingly intense and prolonged humanitarian crises require urgent action to protect the world’s most vulnerable. In 2025, an estimated 305 million people will require humanitarian assistance. The growing scale of global challenges – such as the climate crisis, conflict, and infectious disease outbreaks – is outpacing available resources.

WHO’s Health Emergency Appeal 2025 – When health is at risk, everything is at risk
Every humanitarian crisis is a health crisis
Health is profoundly affected during crisesFrom trauma care to maintaining essential health services, humanitarian crises increase health needs and place extraordinary pressure on local health services. With such wide-ranging impacts, health must be at the heart of any humanitarian response. Without the quick and effective provision of health services, humanitarian crises can have profound and catastrophic health impacts on affected communities. In the darkest moments of a crisis, health services offer a lifeline, giving individuals and communities the strength to endure and the foundation to rebuild.
"Supporting WHO’s Health Emergency Appeal is a powerful act of global solidarity. Together we will save lives, safeguard health as a universal right, and help communities rebuild in the wake of crisis. We do this vital work out of necessity, while knowing that in the long-term, the best medicine is peace."– Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization

WHO’s 2025 funding requirements for responding to emergencies
WHO provides health services where others cannot. As humanitarian funds are increasingly reduced and resources are restricted, the need to increase investment, coordinate action and provide vital life-saving services has never been greater.To meet this challenge in 2025, WHO urgently needs US$ 1.5 billion to respond to 42 ongoing health emergencies, including the 17 grade 3 emergencies requiring the highest level of intervention from WHO.
