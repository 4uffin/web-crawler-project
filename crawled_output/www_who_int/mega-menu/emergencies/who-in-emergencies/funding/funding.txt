Funding for emergencies
WHO thanks all of the contributors that provide funding or in-kind contributions to support our work preventing and responding to emergencies.
WHO Health Emergency Appeal

Contingency Fund for Emergencies
The Contingency Fund for Emergencies (CFE) allows WHO to respond rapidly to disease outbreaks and health emergencies – often in 24 hours or less. The CFE is not earmarked, giving WHO the crucial flexibility it needs to act quickly in response to disease outbreaks, natural disasters, and humanitarian emergencies.
