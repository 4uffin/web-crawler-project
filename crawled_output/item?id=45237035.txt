(For those of us who remember what runs on a bank with your savings in it feel like) What if any protection is there, that you will be able to withdraw your money when a massive dunk in Bitcoin crashes a bunch of major holders and you want your savings back?replykrrishd 28 minutes ago

It's a good question - Stripe's Stablecoin Account documentation is good reference here (they denominate balances in USDB, one of these "custom stablecoins" from Bridge): https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/stablecoin-financial-accounts..."It’s always backed one-to-one by the equivalent value of US dollars held in cash and short-duration money market funds at BlackRock."So while there are other (potentially novel) sorts of counterparty risks - the backing is definitely more robust than (and pretty much entirely decoupled from) Bitcoin/the rest of the crypto sphere, and is closer to dropping funds off in a Fidelity money market.Another good (early - 2023) read on this topic: "There are now two types of PayPal dollars, and one is better than the other

I'm not sure if I'm missing the point here, but stablecoins could be exchanged for something of value at a fixed price. The USD used to be this - you could exchange it for gold. But it was more convenient to give paper money than exchange gold.A Big Mac may cost $5 now, $10 in the future. But I would like a Big Mac Coin that lets me exchange it for one Big Mac in any time in the future. It has value as long as McDonald's exist and is willing to accept the coins, which is better than you can say of most crypto.It may be a different sized burger, it may have somewhat different ingredients. Even our "classic coke" is nothing like the original coke. But this is what I'd expect from branded stablecoins.replykrrishd 3 minutes ago

I think you have a much cooler, futuristic vision of a "branded stablecoin" than what I'm talking about :) Almost like a more practical/feasible version of the "flatcoin" concept Balaji Srinivasan (of Coinbase/a16z/etc) had a while ago: https://x.com/balajis/status/1422993084002934788.Frankly also my initial source of disappointment when I found out what this _actually_ is.But yeah - in the case of this post / Bridge's offering, "branded" stablecoins are still redeemable for 1 USD, the only point of the "branding" is who is entitled to the yield and for how much "program management" around the stored value (relative to eg. a "stored value" program at a partner bank).replyhahahacorn 1 hour ago

Seems like a really inefficient way to do points… my CC company gives me 3 points and I eventually redeem them for USD.
Is that not the L1 L2 network stuff, but just far less efficient than a DB write?replykrrishd 53 minutes ago

From the consumer perspective totally - but those credit card points come from the interchange the issuer makes from issuing the card / your card txns (ie. as a proportion of your _spend_ using the card).The sort of rewards you get for storing your business's cash at eg. Mercury, or using a wallet like Cash App - have to come from yield generated by the actual cash deposits, which is the sort of program that is much harder to operate / requires close ongoing partnership with partner banks / etc.If I'm eg. Mercury, storing the dollars you (business) deposit into my platform in a "branded" stablecoin will get me the same rewards - bc it's backed 1:1 by eg. a money-market fund at Blackrock - for much less of the operational burden, _because_ I'm not participating in a stored value program at an actual bank. The alternative today is that Mercury does store it at a bank, does have to maintain a "stored value" program with that bank, and the yields are standard bank interest (rather than eg. MMF).Moreover - through Bridge, I can withdraw fiat USD and deposit fiat USD into that "branded stablecoin", and it's just an in-app balance in the fintech app - so the fact that it's a stablecoin doesn't change my experience at all other than in conferring standard rewards. If you look at how eg. Stripe Stablecoin Account labels the balance, it just calls it "Digital dollars" - so it's not much more than a backend implementation detail, really.replysalomonk_mur 1 hour ago
