I’m yet to see these models produce anything actually good yet, paid or otherwise.
On the bright side the movie industry seems to have actually been smart and still makes extensive use of unions which should help protect actual artists.JumpCrisscross 0 minutes ago

This is tragic for both the child and the family. The child’s complications came “from a measles infection they acquired when they were an infant who was too young to be vaccinated.”Avicebron 0 minutes ago

on: Designing user interfaces with bots not buttons
When someone first pitched Distributed ID (DIDs) to me, I had this thought that if the user agent was some kind of chat bot/personalized navigation agent, preferably customizable, that would be a really neat way to package increasingly complex identity and auth toolchains.softwaredoug 0 minutes ago

“The Left” as a bunch of educated elites clustered in cities has and will always be fairly impotent (at least electorally, maybe not culturally)“The Left” as defined by a broad, class-base coalition independent of urban/rural has historically been formidable. But as the initial Obama coalition erodes, it becomes less formidable.Really The Left (the Democratic Party) needs to rebuild an electorally successful coalition. The leaders that could die that aren’t obvious to me yet.zahlman 0 minutes ago

> responding to false glorifications of himThat is not a fair characterization of what they are doing, no. (Besides which, "glorification" is subjective. People thinking Kirk was a virtuous person because of things they consider virtuous but you don't, is not "false".)> These comments obviously aren't directed at the family but the news publications and media's handling of his passing.None of the example comments I have been shown reference supposed news or media bias. Many of them have straight up described the murder as a good or morally just action. Some have even expressed a desire for the same to happen to others in Kirk's orbit.CapitalistCartr 1 minute ago

This is not a serious conversation. One party pays lip service while simultaneously trying to appease people who want lower gas prices by approving more drilling and pumping. The other side actively wants to drive us off a cliff. No candidate for president in either party has ever offered even a serious evaluation about the threat global warming poses our way of life, instead assuming that we can technology our way out of it.chairmansteve 1 minute ago

on: The PC was never a true 'IBMer'
I remember eyebrows being raised even at the time over the Chaplin ads, but I suppose they're memorable enough even today that they couldn't have been all that off the mark.
Certainly wasn't the worst of the missteps around the PCjr (and I'd forgotten they ran the same flavor of ads for the PC AT!)aquir 1 minute ago

Isn't this what they have been doing? What nationally prominent democrats are vocal proponents of progressive social policies now? I certainly don't remember harris running on any of the things being implied here.> cut some dead weightThis "dead weight" is the rights of minorities to participate in public life plain and simple. This is exactly why leftists are so skeptical or even hostile to "centrists." Once you're calculating whose rights you can drop for political convenience you share a lot more ideologically with the far right than with historic liberalism.vvpan 2 minutes ago

Also interesting how sites like this are mainstream whereas a link to a site hosting an mp3 of pirated music wouldn’t be tolerated in discussion forums like this.I think a big difference is that there’s no micro transactions or compulsory licensing for content, so it always feels patently unfair to buy a subscription to read one article.ysnp 2 minutes ago

>This was later obsoleted by the OS adding that feature natively, which is an interesting angle to consider; directly supporting the things people root for definitely helps, but you're unlikely to ever get everything so it's not a panacea.For what it's worth, my understanding is that this has always been the position of GrapheneOS too. Given the resources and enough benefit/cost to allocate, the project would rather integrate or implement usability features at the OS level instead of encouraging people to expose attack surface. Specifically because GrapheneOS is a project meant to be primed to defend some of the most intimate and personal aspects of a person's life.whatevaa 3 minutes ago

Corecting others. I'm not hateful, I don't like nitpicking and searching for problems when there aren't any. Yes, I believe pronouns are invented problem, and thus will dismiss this as not important. If you think is is hate, you haven't experienced hate.A lot of people think the same, even if they don't express that online. The only person who hates anything here is you.sneak 3 minutes ago

I do this but annotate books heavily by writing in the margins (digitally through my remarkable) and only very rarely ever revisit them.Writing while reading is a way of focusing on what either resonates with me or confounds me.giantg2 3 minutes ago

Unlike other religions, it said a lot of things that have come true:1. Jerusalem would get destroyed with the temple, the Jews scattered, persecuted, then Israel recreated, big exporter of produce, many trees, survives all its enemies, and yet wouldn't be able to rebuild the temple on one piece of land. All came true and it's the only country to ever re-appear like that.2. Revelation says they will try to build a world government with one currency. They'll financially cut off, or cancel, dissenters. The elites have been repeatedly trying to do that for decades.3. Society itself would change. People would be godless, apathetic, focus on money/pleasure, disobedient to their parents (family disintegration), violent, etc. People would listen to whoever tickled their ears, or told them what they wanted to hear. Famous preachers would be false teachers, perform fake miracles, and do it for ego and money.4. Revelation talks of a new Babylon that was a huge, imperialist nation (or religion) that gets most of the world under its influence, is one of the richest in history, and (strangely) exports sexual immorality to other nations. Aside from imperialisma and capitalism, the U.S. exported sexual immorality worldwide through porn industry, Hollywood movies, and funding LGBT promotion. Whatever it is, God destroys the new Babylon likely via the consequences of its own worldviews.I put more of these up here:https://gethisword.com/signsofthetimes.htmlI'll be glad if Babylon is never raised. It deserved to be destroyed for all the cruel things it did which it never repented of. Over there, they still chase the false religions and practices that tore their country to pieces. If the repent, and turn to Christ, we will see a transformation of the nation like the people of Ninevah saw in Jonah's day.DrewADesign 4 minutes ago

And one hundred million more people voted then watched that debate. And of the people that watched it, I’ll bet most people couldn’t name half the topics discussed that weren’t in their list of top voting issues. I’m not saying they were deceived or didn’t have access to the information, I’m saying that the things they didn’t care about were easily drowned out by what they did. That’s how the human brain works. Nobody’s seeking out reasons to dislike someone they’re excited about and being emotionally validated by. Saying someone supports something just because it didn’t stick out enough to kill their support for someone doesn’t make sense. That’s no different than saying anyone that voted for Harris because trans rights were extremely important to them also supports Israel’s massacre. The world just isn’t that black-and-white.codethief 4 minutes ago

on: MIT-MC CP/M archive files, 1979-1984
The archive has info-cpm mailing list content as well as code; a surprising amount of the mailing list traffic is complaining about the mailing list, if you thought that sort of thing had changed in the last 40 years.
(The archive itself is "a little before my [online] time" but I recognized names like Jerry Pournelle, Lauren Weinstein, Bandy, and James Gosling...)zhouzhao 4 minutes ago
