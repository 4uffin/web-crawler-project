on: Why you’d issue a branded stablecoin
This is a great question, I actually don't even think it's strictly a matter of "more" yield.To dig into your example a bit deeper, there are a few general differences with an (eg.) Unit vs. Bridge.- With a BaaS like unit, you're often actually forming a partnership _not just_ with Unit (a software provider), but the partner banks Unit works with. More specifically, you're operating two sorts of programs with the partner bank: programs around "money transmission" (_moving_ money on behalf of customers) and around "stored value" (_storing_ money on behalf of customers). Each of these programs tends to be pretty involved.- With Bridge: Bridge is your single partner. Bridge _itself_ has partner banks for the sake of both banking + money movement, but when you store customer funds as stablecoins in a crypto "wallet" Bridge spins up, it is operationally different than if you were to store them as fiat in a customer-specific bank account at Bridge's partner bank, under a classic "stored value" program. The partner bank is more involved in the money _transmission_ piece, when you want to receive customer funds in as fiat, or push customer funds out as fiat - but the funds being stablecoin at rest would seem to impact the burden here.(Some of the details above may be wrong / vary by providers / etc - but having worked with both of these sorts of providers, this is the "felt" different and also my high-level understanding).zahlman 1 minute ago

on: Myocardial infarction may be an infectious disease
"The most unique finding in our study was that viridans streptococci seemed to colonize the lipid core and wall of an atheroma as a biofilm and that this biofilm was not recognized by cells of the innate immune system. "This is a pretty cool finding. Biofilms are also beyond reach of antibacterials usually. And seing a commensal become a problem due to "location, location, location" is also cool.Nice article.

> No way. I'm shocked.Please don't do this. Criticizing and thinking about the outlines of new solutions is a necessary first step. Details can be figured out after people agree on what the problems with the current systems are. Obviously I'm aware of the problems of previously attempted systems and don't wish to repeat them. If we can't figure out better details than those tried before, then of course I would prefer the current system.> people don't want to be equal as humans are hierarchical creaturesSure, humans have many kinds of needs and wants, and climbing the social hierarchy is just one of them. Why should we base our governance and our economic system on that need instead of something less destructive? There can still be hierarchies, just not the kind of hierarchies that give people power over others. An olympic gold medalist is at the top of a hierarchy, but doesn't have much power to control other people. Hierarchies like that could still remain to satisfy the people who have a strong need for such a thing.Also, as I've said in other comments, I do believe there might be a need for some level of differences in rewards, as not all jobs are such that enough people would want to do them purely from intrinsic motivation. In such cases there should first be attempts to find rewards that don't provide control over other people, and if that is not enough, then we should figure out if the job is absolutely necessary and increase the rewards little by little until we have enough people doing it. Not all power differential can or should be avoided, but creating them should be the last resort and as small as possible.> You can't EVER equalize outcomes because everyone is born differently and will have different physical and metal abilities and will max out at different skill levels.Maybe not entirely, but we could do much much better than what is happening now. It's important that we have a system where people are encouraged to use their abilities to improve society, but the huge differences in the resources people get is surely not the only way to achieve that. A lot of scientists do science not because the pay is great, but because they're interested in the topic and there's fame and knowledge to be had. Also the rewards that people expect are relative. In a society where someone gets paid 300 times more than others the most skilled people won't want to do the work for less than that, but in a society where the highest reward is 5 times more than others the most skilled people would still gravitate towards that work. Maybe personal interests would have a larger part in deciding what a person chooses to work on, but I don't think that would be a bad thing.> try to equalize opportunities so that everyone gets a shot at the same opportunities regardless of birth RNG, but you still want the best one to win regardless, if you want society to progress through fairness.But this will eventually lead to the winners taking more and more, we end up with a system similar to what the soviet union was and we will crash. The direction we are heading in is plainly visible. The capitalist system is better than the soviet one, as it's slower to centralize power, but eventually the power differentials and resulting corruption will be large enough that the system no longer functions, and we are very close to it I think.We can continue this way and crash and reset every few hundred years, or we can acknowledge that it is the centralization of power that causes these issues and try to build a system that avoids it as much as possible.hx8 3 minutes ago

on: Recreating the US/* time zone situation
Here the problem is that past "time" values and future "time" values should be different data types.A past time value (e.g. the times of logged events) actually is a time value that is known and it should be stored as a TAI or UTC value and when desired it can be converted to any date/time format for presentation purposes.In most cases, a future time value is not a known time value yet and it must be stored as a more complex data type, at the minimum including the local time and the time zone, but for more distant future dates preferably also including the exact geographic location, for the eventuality of changes in the time zone laws.IncreasePosts 4 minutes ago

on: Safe C++ proposal is not being continued
Spot on, since C++11 the committee has increasingly started to design and add features to the standard without any kind of implementation, only after the standard gets ratified, the implementers eventually find out that the design is broken, or has flaws.A strange phenomenon akin to the Algol 68 days, and no other ISO based language is taking, where standardising existing practice or having a full test implementation is still pretty much what it being done.How many export templates, GC, type traits defect fixes, volatile behaviour changes, modules, contracts,.... can implementers still put up with?CheeseFromLidl 5 minutes ago

on: If my kids excel, will they move away?
This is the first in a very long time that I’ve seen my thoughts written down by someone else. Unfortunately I didn’t get out and thanks to 2 burnouts & counting I’m stuck in a shithole country doing shithole jobs.If you’re young and want to get out, get out. Don’t take my path of studying and working until a path emerges. If I could do it again I don’t think I’d even finish secondary education and just pack my bags at 17.procaryote 6 minutes ago

I’ve been wondering the same thing about meditation: it is “known” that is is good for you in the long-term, but I wonder if spending time focused on a point in your mind is a very good idea for people that spend a lot of time stuck in their own minds and thoughts. In periods of solitude, I’ve found meditation to increase feelings of depersonalisation and solipsism, that I can easily imagine could precipitate into psychosis for some people. I don’t do much of it any more, and for people like me, I believe physical exercise to be a much better counterweight to too much thinking.We push these one-size-fits-all suggestions, but we are never told who have they modeled from; not everybody is the same, and our minds are even more diverse than our biology.Also, re: running on autopilot: the goal of mindfulness is to be aware of every waking moment, yet our biology is very much tuned to running on autopilot because it is so much more efficient and frees CPU time for higher processing—you don’t want to be focusing on every muscle when you walk now, do you? Is it such a great idea to overrule our energy conservation protocols our brains depend upon?(Sorry for the off-topic, your comment was too interesting)mrtesthah 7 minutes ago

on: Safe C++ proposal is not being continued
I do want C++ to be a safer language, but I don't think inheriting the Rust safety model is the way to go. It is in a way revolutionary but has major downsides like inability to deal with cyclic data structures without clumpsy workarounds.I don't want to play with a plastic sword, just put it in a sheath.IshKebab 7 minutes ago

on: Safe C++ proposal is not being continued
I think D failed to gain widespread traction for other reasons though:1. The use of garbage collection. If you accept GC there are many other languages you can use. If you don't want GC the only realistic option was C++. Rust doesn't rely on GC.IIRC GC in D is optional in some way, but the story always felt murky to me and that always felt like a way of weaseling out of that problem - like if I actually started writing D I'd find all the libraries needed GC anyway.2. The awkward standard library schism.3. Small community compared to C++. I think it probably just didn't offer enough to overcome this, whereas Rust did. Rust also had the help of backing from a large organisation.I don't recall anyone ever mentioning its improved safety. I had a look on Algolia back through HN and most praise is about metaprogramming or it being generally more modern and sane than C++. I couldn't find a single mention of anything to do with safety or anything on your list.Whereas Rust shouts safety from the rooftops. Arguably too much!abstractspoon 8 minutes ago

on: Myocardial infarction may be an infectious disease
While you're not technically wrong, I find this whole approach to be not good.And actually, if as a lot of science is now suggesting, inflammation and damage due to eating oxidization-prone lipids (aka refined oils) in combination with refined sugar is a big part of the cause of arterial damage and heart disease, that could be easily be the biggest root cause in most of these cases.
The bacteria if they even play a causal role at any point, could be a result of previous damage due to diet (and lack of exercise).The paper's idea of treating heart disease by giving patients antibiotics seems really problematic to me.
Destroy your health with poor diet and lack of exercise, and then once you start to feel the effect of this, take antibiotics and destroy your gut health too.krrishd 8 minutes ago

Yeah that's a good flag.To be even more specific though, "cash equivalent" and the sorts of treasuries that implies are specifically short-duration ones (ie. this cash cannot be parked in a 10-year US treasury either)Cash equivalents are short-term commitments "with temporarily idle cash and easily convertible into a known cash amount"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cash_and_cash_equivalentsMisterBastahrd 8 minutes ago
