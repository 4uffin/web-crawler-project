Considering the core utils have even been ported to Windows, I don’t really see what you would lose.The Unix don’t really share much between each other apart from the small core.jerf 0 minutes ago

You're focusing on what you can't do. Count how many places have a search on a website that let you run "((A and B) or (C and D) XOR E) AND NOT F". It's not many.The very complaints you are making are kind of my point; that you can even consider making them means they've put a lot of work into a search interface that few other search interfaces have.general1465 0 minutes ago

> zooming in shows the gritty details, like Google Maps for codeThat's how KiCAD and other CADs for electronics make PCBs. You will put big parts (that's usually hardware design driven), then you will put smaller parts around it and then you are trying to connect each smaller part with correct signal without crossing each other.mapontosevenths 0 minutes ago

WNBA players are about as famous as C-tier youtubers. At the time of this event, WNBA games were averaging 379k viewers [1].Biden did it for personal electoral ambitions. Polls showed him rapidly losing more of the black vote, which would be critical for his electoral success, to Trump. And indeed this shift is one of the many reasons Trump was able to not only win, but able to win the popular vote as well, which no Republican had done in 20 years.Trading her for Viktor Bout (the guy who the movie Lord of War was based on) was idiotic in every way imaginable, even including electoral ambitions as it seemed to have had no meaningful effect whatsoever besides getting rid of one of the US's most valuable 'cards.'[1] - https://www.wnba.com/news/wnba-delivers-most-watched-regular...noir_lord 0 minutes ago

They were also clever being on the first line supporting Linux back in the 2000's.Nowadays not only they own one of the few UNIX proper left standing, they also own everything Red-Hat contributes for.sbinder 0 minutes ago

I think the data presented at ASCO this year showed an increase in adenomas (benign, potential precursors of colon cancer) among marathoners. It’s unknown yet whether the that translates into an increase incidence of colon cancer in this population, though it would be prudent to assume so for now. The study was smallish n=100 IIRC so more research is warranted. Interesting to consider the biological mechanisms if this relationship holds up.rpdillon 1 minute ago

This sounds in awful lot like a cousin of the broken window fallacy.The fallacy being that when a careless kid breaks a window of a store, that we should celebrate because the glazier now has been paid to come out and do a job. Economic activity has increased by one measure! Should we go around breaking windows? Of course not.VeejayRampay 2 minutes ago

on: Gemini (2023)
It is rather easy to have one running alongside the other and the gemtext syntax is such it is quite easy to make automatic converters. Did you encounter issues maintaining both?I mean I truly believe anyone can do small websites using HTML standards so for the actual content producer Gemini doesn't have much appeal. On the other hand using Gemini provide the user/visitor a guarantee he will not end up following a link and ending up in a bloated, privacy and ad nightmare. So I think it is sane to offer that even if you believe in small web.ASalazarMX 2 minutes ago

You should stay away from this, in case you haven't figured it out. You're not even in the ballpark of a correct understanding of this situation. Better to just think you could argue your way out of this with a deficient understanding of the law than to put it to the test and find out how wrong you are in a courtroom.ndsipa_pomu 2 minutes ago

on: ‘Overworked, underpaid’ humans train Google’s AI
> Glad to learn from your post that the labor market has recently become perfectly competitive and efficient.Underpaid just isn't a useful term. If it's their best option for a job in the whole world then their employer is the best it could possibly be. Describing that situation as "underpaid" is just manipulative.classichasclass 3 minutes ago

(author) Just because I'm used to 6.5, no other reason particularly. Any of the SCSI emulators are generally fine but I now gravitate to the ones that let you run multiple devices from image files because that makes it very easy to do backups. Here I used a ZuluSCSI, which is also one of the ones where if you have an existing drive, it will clone it for you in initiator mode.The power supplies are a bigger question, but some work has been done on this already with other systems, notably the Fuel. There is at least a way to repair the Impact supplies' caps, though that's not all that can go wrong. I expect we'll eventually see conversion kits for these other big systems at some stage.pessimizer 3 minutes ago

It's only "it's" if it is "it is."If it is not "it is," but possessive, it's "its."-----Or to be clear (lol),1) The possessive of "it" is "its."2) "It's" is a contraction of "it is."hyperman1 3 minutes ago

on: Safe C++ proposal is not being continued
I've been on the edge to try out D a few times now, and always decided for No in the end.For me, it was missing presence in the IT news that did it. D might be great, but it makes no noise.Rust or go had a lot of articles and blog posts going deep into specific posts, appearing at a regular rate.
They tended to appear on e.g this hacker news, or reddit, etc...
This caused a drip feed of tutoring, giving me a slow but steady feel for these languagee.
There were people tirelessly correcting misinformation.
There were non stop code examples of people doing stuff with the language, proving the language usable in all kind of situations.npteljes 3 minutes ago

on: Charlie Kirk killed at event in Utah
Yes, I posted that quote, as an example of what kind of statements he was making. And again, I'm not against his positions per se - I'm highlighting that with Charlie, there is a lot more going on under the surface, than over the surface. On the surface, he says things that are at least somewhat defensible. But the way of phrasing, the overall direction of where his things are going are different than what he is formulating.tremon 3 minutes ago

“Memory movement”? None of the instructions you list involve memory.I find the perfect hash implementation a bit weird; it seems to obfuscate that you simply look at the lowest two bits (since they differ between the four values). You can do the x + 3 and 3 - expr at the very end, once, instead of for every element.pjmlp 3 minutes ago

I believe there have been other studies showing people with a history of depression develop dementia at higher rates. There are some that have shown the structural/signal changes that happen after longterm depression as well. These are things that occur years or decades before the dementia.More
