Those are just slogans. But in terms of arguments, I would say he had one major negative argument "Her Emails" and two major positive arguments "Make America Great Again" "Build a Wall".The most important thing is that these are points that are so simple even an idiot can understand them.I can't even keep track of all of trump's controversies because they are so numerous. But if I was a democrat I would just stick to one or two points that even moderates can resonate with like the "Epstein Files" or Palantir or something.greyb 1 minute ago

on: Four-year wedding crasher mystery solved
My father, a blue collar immigrant worker, did the same thing in his 40s. His CEO had an open door policy so he went in and expressed concerns. That day, he learnt that an open door policy is a massive red herring and got reamed for disturbing the CEO. It was all performative - they don't actually care.charcircuit 1 minute ago

The issue is, the current administration seems to be hell bent on speed running the course to a similar destination. The overt attempts to politicize the Fed and key govt institutions has sown the seeds to distrust in US govt data and monetary policy.Whether we water and fertilize the seeds, or let them dry and wither will decide the level of credibility we get in the future.Strong institutions are absolutely critical for long term economic success. Enforcement of the rule of law, accurate data and credible monetary policy are the bedrock on which long term economic prosperity is built. Right now, we seem to be taking a jackhammer to that foundation.like_any_other 2 minutes ago

Not disingenuous, I think. I did vote for Trump, and even if I had a crystal ball in November and knew then what I know now, I would still prefer him to Harris. On the other hand, I have been quite vocal in my criticism of him -- but the circle of friends and acquaintances who have heard my criticisms is pretty small.mayneack 5 minutes ago

I would find it hard to imagine they wouldn't welcome foreign students just for the fact that there are so few in comparison to start with. Even if tons of US kids started going to China for college, they would always remain a tiny fraction of students due to the population size disparity.UltraSane 5 minutes ago

Why are you, in one post, talking about how you will never stop pirating, while in this thread you're calling for executions for that very action?https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45236861>
IlikeKitties 2 hours ago | unvote | parent | prev | next [–]Just to be clear: There are people like me that will NEVER EVER stop pirating media. I've done it my whole life and I will do it for the rest of my life. You can now chose to accept that because I and others like me exist, your freedoms must be destroyed or recognize that freedoms necessarily allow for "abuse" and realize that these media conglomerates would rather see the internet, the only truly global technology, fundamentally destroyed before giving you just enough freedom to maybe abuse it.bruceb 6 minutes ago

You're essentially encouraging people to give up and leave it broken.Sure, a lot of code changes need to happen, but they only need to happen once. There's no real reason to discourage people from stepping closer to the end goal.porridgeraisin 7 minutes ago

on: Wayland breaks the tools I use to make a living
> Two things: First, yes, a lot of Wayland's missing features absolutely were intentional omissions in the name of security. This is even almost understandable; the only difference between a vital a11y tool and horrible malware is whether the software acts on behalf of the user or against them, there is no technical distinction. Second... Wayland is almost 17 years old. If it was 2010, I would readily accept that it was early WIP software, but we're past the point where 'they just haven't gotten there yet' is convincing.Firstly, the problem is when you put it this way, people think that Wayland can't do accessibility, or screen capture, or automation. It is true that it is intentional that a Wayland program can't simply expect there to just be the ability to go and read screen contents (or inject inputs, or intercept input, or ...) without permission, but that's not just security, I think that's also somewhat a result of the fact that the Wayland core protocol is really not applicable to any specific use cases, and is really just the bare bones necessary for programs to talk to a compositing system. For example, you can't really do proper desktop applications as we know them without something like xdg-shell, which isn't part of the core Wayland protocols, and yet it's totally possible to have Wayland protocols that do things like screen capture, and they can be as "standard" as the ecosystem wants. (Unfortunately that stuff usually gets relegated to DBus presumably because nobody actually wants to support authorization on the Wayland side, but oh well.) To put it more clearly, there is absolutely no reason that Wayland desktop systems can't just expose every bit of functionality X.org allowed to all apps if they want to, security be damned, and the protocols can be standardized; wlroots compositors usually do basically this after all, and I think these days the protocols are all ext protocols upstreamed to wayland-protocols. (And in practice, secure alternatives that allow for proper automation/accessiblity/etc. are very likely to exist and be supported by all major desktops in the long run.) I think people get the wrong idea that Wayland is telling them they can't ever do this, but it's really just telling application developers they can't absolutely count on being able to do it like they can in X.org.Secondly, the "Wayland is x years old" thing just doesn't make sense, this has to stop. This isn't a project with full time employees like at your job, it's a distributed open source effort. The investments are incredibly uneven both over time and for specific areas of interest. Until about 10 years ago, Wayland was basically not usable at all for almost anybody, and until the last few years the vast majority of Linux users were using NVIDIA GPUs and couldn't really use Wayland without pretty terrible bugs (XWayland was especially broken. AFAIK to this day NVIDIA is working through XWayland issues that never existed on AMD/Intel.) The momentum Wayland had back when nobody could really use it was pretty damn bad. This isn't really terribly unusual for open source projects of this nature though; I mean look at how catastrophically long it took for GIMP 3.0 to come out, and that is a lot less complex and multifaceted than entire desktop systems.I'm not saying that the initial work done on Wayland was bad or not important, but the majority of work done on making Wayland usable in real life happened in the past few years. 17 years ago or so, all that existed of Wayland in practice were some ideas about how to design a graphical interface system to succeed X.org. (and at that time, Wayland's design was probably too radical anyways: I don't think it's clear that all Linux users would've accepted things about Wayland that hardly anyone complains about today, like the pervasive use of compositing without a traditional fallback. Today X.org is basically the only commonly used windowing system that can properly operate without some form of compositing.)branko_d 8 minutes ago

on: 486Tang – 486 on a credit-card-sized FPGA board
I found 10 Intel Galileo dev kits, new in box, left at our local recycling center on the "Free: Take Me Home" shelf.And just today, I received the Intel Edison dev kit that I'd purchased on eBay.The Galileo is a Quark X1000 SoC, two P54C cores. In-order, original 32-bit Pentium.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Galileo.The Edison is a modern System On Module about the size of an SD card but about 3x the thickness of one. It's far more capable: dual 64-bit Silvermont Atom cores, Super scalar out of order. And an additional Quark core as a system monitor, running an independent RTOS. There's also 4GB eMMC, 1GB RAM, WiFi, and Bluetooth on the module. Its quite a remarkable curiosity.Ten years ago, Intel tried to catch up to ARM in tablets and smartphones, but it was already too late, and this entire segment of Intel was cancelled within a year or two.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_EdisonNext up is building more recent Linux images for these via the Yocto Project and the now cancelled Intel Board Support Packages (BSP).If you like low power tiny systems, there's a strange amount of fun to be had.kelnos 10 minutes ago

antirez's success doesn't mean anything since antirez is far, far above average as a developer and is able to wield AI very effectively because of his talents and knowledge.
Most developers are not remotely close to antirez's skill level (half are below average, by definition) and are likely going to suffer the problems that skeptics are already seeing.RajT88 11 minutes ago

on: High Altitude Living – 8,000 ft and above (2021)
I wonder if they're confusing the cause and effect.Do people who live above 8k feet not die of heart disease or do people with heart disease find it too difficult to live above 8k feet so only people without heart disease live above 8k feet?I live at 7200 feet and I know several people who have moved to lower altitudes because it's "too hard to breath" here.More
