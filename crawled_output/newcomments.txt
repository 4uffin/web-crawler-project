on: Pass: Unix Password Manager
I have a different approach I’ve used for about 10 years that I like a lot.
All password metadata is stored in a plain JSON file indexed by name (usually site name). Each entry contains at the minimum a username. Optionally it has a version number and some password rules like the length (20 if absent) and the character classes that are allowed, along with how many of each character class are required. None of this data is sensitive, so if you look at the file you see my list of sites.
The actual passwords are not stored, because my tool is actually a deterministic password generator, which prompts me for a passphrase and generates a password from the passphrase and a hash of all the metadata.
One nice feature is that if I just change the version number I get a whole new password, and the “history” is still available by changing the version back.The one major downside to it is that it is absolutely unusable for sharing passwords because obviously that would require sharing my passphrase, and there is no way to “store” a password that someone else set. I’ve thought about writing a mode that would encrypt a string (eg a shared password) with the metadata-generated password and store it in a separate piece of metadata for that purpose, but the number of times I’ve needed that has been extremely small.daneel_w 1 minute ago

on: AMD’s RDNA4 GPU architecture
Are the 10- and 40- series similar? Before the 1650 I had the 1060 in the same PC, and for a while I had an RTX 4060 in it as well (which I bailed on because the model emitted terrible coil noise). Neither really made any mentionable difference in idle power. I'm personally convinced that besides "NUCs" and running on only a 25-35W AMD APU with no discrete graphics card, the days of low-power stationary PCs are long over.bawolff 1 minute ago

I think the bar has raised, for sure. There's code I work on from prior seniors that is worse than what our current juniors write, I'm assuming AI is assisting with that but as long as the PR looks good, it's no different to me.Keyframe 1 minute ago

This gets you mice that are better at navigating mazes. The connection between that and general cognition or learning capacity is not as robust as you would hope. Just as likely they simply have better peripheral vision or something.mdasen 2 minutes ago

on: macOS Tahoe is certified Unix 03 [pdf]
There isn't much downside, but it probably involves a small amount of money (paid for the certification) and it means spending time making sure that everything remains 100% within spec. There's lots of little edge cases where BSDs differ from the spec and it means that Apple needs to take care not to drift from the spec.MangoToupe 2 minutes ago

on: EU court rules nuclear energy is clean energy
Irrational, perhaps, but also totally understandable and unlikely to change.People fly because it requires a huge amount of trust to put yourself in someone’s hands like that, where if something goes wrong the results are catastrophic. People have faith in the regulations, they trust that the pilots are well-trained and the planes well-maintained, to the point where the chances of catastrophe are so small it overcomes their natural fears.The same is true of the nuclear industry. The only thing making nuclear a remotely popular option is the extensive regulation which makes the risk to the consumer so small it outweighs their fears.And the trouble is that it is up against solar and wind, where the cost is much smaller, and the absolute risk - if you discount people who choose to working to install them - really is very close to 0.XzetaU8 3 minutes ago

> My second thought is how badly Chinese communism must be doing that they need such a massive effort in order to prevent their citizens from accessing information and voicing dissent.I don't quite understand why the first impulse is that it covers up government incompetence. There are other incentives for mass social control of discourse and information.analog31 3 minutes ago

I assume you mean "defund."Another thing people are unaware of is that the majority of scientists are experimentalists, not theoreticians. Why would we want to be experimental scientists at all?

Governments aren’t banning or restricting it because “god said it was bad”. Nor is the GGGP arguing that we should take it seriously because governments do so. Those would be specific appeals to authority. The GGGP argument uses examples of cases where social media has been taken seriously enough to result in government regulation to directly rebut the GGGGP’s claim that social media is only being discussed on substack and not more broadly.thedrbrian 3 minutes ago

on: The value of bringing a telephoto lens
>One day, after "seeing" some good shots in my head and totally missing them due to phone camera limitations, I decided I had to fix it.That was my problem. Went to an air show and used my iPhone 13 and got some good pictures.
iPhone 16 comes out and it’s got a 5x zoom and the best camera ever. You’re gonna love it. And the pictures were better but still ok.So I’ve gone all in and bought a proper Canon mirrorless and a selection of lenses including a 100mm to 400mm and it’s miles better.I tell the camera what to focus on , I set everything and I control what it does no software second guessing me and taking a lovely picture of a tree and not the eurofighrer in the background.I love that it’s got one job and it does it brilliantly.mapontosevenths 3 minutes ago

To be clear, I'm saying that Biden fought for Griner because she was famous, not because she enjoyed cannabis and liked the ladies or whatever it is Kirk seems to think. Spies aren't famous by definition.It's reasonable to disagree with Bidens choice, but it's rage bait to make it about her skin color and toilet-part preferences.That's what Kirk did for a living though.westurner 3 minutes ago

I'd take tests over docs but that's a false dilemma.What does the (Copilot) /tests command do, compared to a prompt like "Generate tests for #symbolname, run them, and modify the FUT function under test and run the tests in a loop until the tests pass"?Documentation is probably key to the Django web framework's success, for example.Resources useful for learning to write great docs:

“The prevalence of cognitive disorders is increasing year by year, placing a heavy burden on patients, families, and society. It is estimated that the total annual cost of dementia disease in China will reach $1.89 trillion in 2050 [4]. However, there is no drug that can stop or reverse the progression of dementia.”That is my own RNT. If only there were a way to escape from this reality. Death, taxes and global population collapse while a huge proportion of the voting population loses their ability to do basic tasks while still clinging to political hegemony in the nations they destroy. What a great time to be alive.pas 5 minutes ago

on: OrioleDB Patent: now freely available to the Postg...
Ah, I completely support your righteous anger against the tragicomedy of US "IP colonisation", though note that it has not much to do with my comment about the possibility of an open source patent.The fact that most of the world was just laying down belly up to accept the negative consequences of the ridiculous cottage industry of churning out patents "for later" is truly enraging if someone gets to see how little value it produces. (It's very convenient for large conglomerates, VC fueled startups, and ... that's it.)When it comes to specifics, ie. with pharma, it's hard to really disentangle the mess from other ugly facts, like the post-WWII global economy which and the very misregulated US healthcare industry (R&D including).The US is subsidizing R&D for the world, because the other rich countries have sane "collective bargaining", but this leaves the small not so rich markets out in the fucking cold, because they have a weak bargaining position (market access doesn't worth that much to pharma companies) and also usually no internal R&D (so no local companies filing for these trivial parents). But because of all this in effect the world is buying R&D at the worst price!(Though of course the picture is more complicated than this, but R&D is definitely waaay too inefficient in the US, but also all over the world too.)scloudfox 5 minutes ago
