on: My thoughts on renting versus buying
I live in a traditional middle class neighborhood and half the houses are rentals for college kids and people who can't buy. I'm not sure who to agree with here.wavemode 0 minutes ago

> If you rent you're left with nothing.Well, no. You're left with the cash you would've spent buying a house.Whether that's financially better or worse, depends entirely on the mortgage interest, taxes, and maintenance costs of the house, as well as the money you could have earned investing the cash elsewhere, compared to the rent you would have spent over the same time period.al_borland 0 minutes ago

on: My thoughts on renting versus buying
I saw this when I lived in the Chicagoland area. A co-worker was giving me the business for renting instead of buying something. The he let it slip that his property tax alone was $35k/year, almost 2x what I was paying in rent, and that didn’t even include the mortgage.LtWorf 0 minutes ago

I think I disagree with this sentiment. I’ve found AI to be poor at one-shotting rust but give it a short agentic loop running `cargo check` and it can often produce code more solid than that created with a dynamically typed language.moduspol 1 minute ago

Me, too, and I agree it has helped in my marriage. I don't think it'd be helpful in all marriages, though. Particularly if you are in a career that puts you in high-temptation situations.542458 1 minute ago

The argument, which doesn't seem insane, is that this film is useful because it is particularly optically clear. I agree 17 days is too short, but that seems like an interesting opportunity for future research.theptip 2 minutes ago

on: My thoughts on renting versus buying
Unfortunately, a bit of a one-sided article.The most convincing argument for buying housing is that it hedges you from potential large future cost of living increases. If you can’t afford repeated rent increases then the consequences will ripple through your life.I’ve heard this pithily stated as “you are naturally short housing”.https://thezikomoletter.wordpress.com/2012/12/10/you-are-nat...Another newer argument is that if you think inflation could be much higher in the future, then a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is a very attractive instrument; it’s a government-financed option. May as well benefit from it while it lasts. (If rates go down you can just re-fi.)foota 2 minutes ago

on: My thoughts on renting versus buying
Making that much, I wouldn’t want to put anymore than 25% of my take-home toward rent. That would mean making $312k take-home… after taxes, retirement, etc.Maybe I’m conservative, but being house poor while making $300k is insane.I’m thinking someone would need to be pushing $400-500k for household income. That would put them in the top 3%. I don’t get the supply and demand curve on it. Making that much, and renting. It’s an even smaller market than the full 3%.AfterHIA 2 minutes ago

on: My thoughts on renting versus buying
> People obsess over granite countertops, open floor plans, stainless steel appliances, and walk in closets. These might make you happy but they don’t make you rich.Money is a means to an end, and being happy is a fine end. I only live once and if I can be happy, well then I've pretty much won. Also you're not going to "get rich" by renting, if (and it's a huge if) you can somehow make renting work in your financial favor compared to buying, it's going to be a tiny bit better. You're not going to 10X your income renting.He also completely discounts the cost of moving constantly (aka "flexibility"), movers, deposits, furnishings... it's not cheap. Yeah you can move yourself (add in the cost of vehicle to make that happen) but it's going to take time, and time is money.This is not a well thought out article.gnabgib 2 minutes ago

on: Models of European metro stations
Are there at least multiple entrances? Dublin's main station, Connolly, is actually the amalgamation of two stations, one terminal station and one through station, which were originally owned by different companies before the rail system was nationalised. The only entrances are through the terminal station, so to get to the through lines, you need to walk for about 10 minutes through the terminal station (making them mostly pointless; it's usually quicker just to get on/off at the next station, which has a proper entrance).They are, apparently, _finally_ going to open a new entrance directly to the through lines, but they've been talking about it for years and I'll believe it when I see it.bjtitus 3 minutes ago

I've used contacts for about 20 years and I prefer them to glasses doing anything active and generally traveling. I would be very worried about navigating the world without being able to read things 3 feet away with my prescription of -4 so I always travel with a pair of glasses.AfterHIA 3 minutes ago

> Buying a Home Isn’t Really an InvestmentThat's... really not correct.
And the section that follows the heading doesn't talk about (or even try to define) "investments" at all.A home mortgage is a heavily (!) subsidized, very safe, easily-acquired and extremely leveraged investment in an asset class that tends over long terms to grow as well as anything else.A young professional looking at a putting $100k into stocks or as downpayment on a $500k (!) mortgage is just a no brainer.
Fast forward 20 years and the 5x is applied to all the appreciation.Buy homes, folks.
Worry about renting only when you're old and are making the decision as to whether to by your fifth home for cash or to finance and put the money into another asset class.
The only time you decide not to is when you know a priori you can't hold the property long enough to cover the purchase overhead.(That said: there are lots of macroeconomic and environmental reasons to think a culture where everyone should buy a home is a bad thing.
But in our culture, everyone should buy a home.)lippihom 3 minutes ago
