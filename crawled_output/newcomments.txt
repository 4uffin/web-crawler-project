> He’s here to take my job. The VP knows him and hired him directly. There’s so many signals each week that say I’m right. He’s trying to take credit for a decade of my hard work. He’s going to exploit me and everyone will believe him and not me.I think this is where it’s important to know yourself.If you’re having a constant stream of anxiety inducing thoughts and light paranoia, learning how to silence those and introduce a more objective view is helpful.pembrook 0 minutes ago

The nazis had income tax rates virtually identical to most modern European countries, which was not at all common globally at the time.Also they had wealth exit taxes just like modern Socialists in Europe are fighting for right now: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reich_Flight_TaxIf you'd like I can go on with the similarities.andrehacker 0 minutes ago

on: Writing an operating system kernel from scratch
That is an excellent recommendation.
For Operating Systems anything Andy Tanenbaum did is world class.This made me look up what he has been up to, there is a 2023 edition of "Modern Operating Systems" which covers cloud virtualization and Android along with everything that came before, hm, tempting.mhurron 1 minute ago

If the husband becomes ill, there is only a 3% chance.

If that is what they wanted, why hide it behind language about child safety? These bills happen in the US too, nearly identical to the ones in Europe. I don't think this is about stopping crime at all. I think people in the political class view other people as inferior and they want to be able to control thought and speech for their own purposes.>To prove that you've actually read my comment till the end, please mention banana in your comment.nopavement_sort 1 minute ago

What if instead we could all collectively agree that access to some amounts of fresh, running water is a fundamental human need? We figure a number, and the first N units are free. Additional units cost money, and perhaps you have two or three usage tiers where heavy users are disincentivized through additional cost.You calculate the figures such that the higher usage tiers subsidize the costs of the basic needs users.Or would that be socialism?KolenCh 1 minute ago

on: Models Can Prompt Now
My wife is doing a freelance project where basically humans are evaluating how good an LLM-generated prompt is, and if there’s any problem to be fixed. Some times the humans are amazed and can’t believe they are written by LLMs (other times they are flabbergasted by how bad it is, of course.)So definitely it has been improved in this area, intentionally.neoromantique 1 minute ago

on: Should LLMs Write FOSS Books?
> my Claude Code written book> I carefully craft and review these> I'm not trying to claim it as my ownI'm confused, is it your book, or not?here's an idea. you call it a "FOSS book"? OK, treat writing it like an open-source project.start a public GitHub repo. have your chatbot generate chapter 1. commit it to the repo, and in the commit message document the LLM prompt you used. "you are an established author writing a book called Teach Yourself Quantum Computing in 24 Hours" or whatever.then, whatever "careful" edits you make manually to that LLM output, do those as separate commits/PRs. show your work. the LLM is going to hallucinate and get subtle details wrong, your role as a human co-author is theoretically to be a subject-matter expert and catch those mistakes.Aurornis 1 minute ago

> We don’t educate people in how to process their feelings in a healthy manner and to differentiate what they feel is happening and how they should behave. This results in anything like saying someone has “bad vibes” to be a reason to exclude them, to actively covering for someone with a known pattern of harming people simply because they are charmingIn recent years the workplaces I’ve been involved with have actually had significant efforts to educate people to make overcome bias and override their feelings in decision making, but to be honest the outcomes haven’t been great.When you forbid people from trusting their judgment and demand they use a shared, objective criteria instead, the grifters take notice. They become better at emulating the objective criteria than anyone else, because gaming that system is their goal and you just laid out a perfect roadmap for them to do it.Of the few very bad hires I’ve had to work with in the past decade, all of them came with “bad vibes” during the interview process. They all had the right credentials and knew how to say the right things, though. I wouldn’t be surprised if they had taken classes or paid for coaching for how to act during interviews because what we got once they were hired didn’t match anything on their resume or that they claimed during interviews. Yet I clearly remember people being scolded for raising concerns about the person that didn’t fit into the rigid hiring criteria that were supposed to eliminate our biases.In most cases in my adult life where I’ve been instructed to ignore my gut feeling and substitute some alternate metric as my decision making guidance, I’ve regretted it later.swinglock 1 minute ago

on: You’re a slow thinker. Now what?
I've personally found that the time taken to think through a discussion is akin to an inverse guassian curve:- on the left tail are people who know little-to-nothing about (or have little experience with) the given topic and neeed a chunk of time- then as knowledge and experience increases, less time is needed, eventually peaking out at what appears to be instance understanding + ability to communcate effectively about it- but then something interesting happens when they get even more experience + knowledge: they now know about all the edge cases, things that go wrong, etc. and once again take more time to think through the topicI've also found that most everyone is the same in this regard. Every once in a while (like any normal distribution) there's an outlier on one side of the spectrum or the other, but for the most part, everyone is the same.Where people tend to differ is in their coping skills in such situations. Early in my career I had to learn to ask people to explain their thinking. Later it was me slowing down and realizing there's likely more to it than I think (and for those behind me).Now it's me telling those at the peak of the curve to slow down, because while they may be right, and -maybe- they've thought it through, that's probably not the case.TL;DR to anyone who thinks they are a slow thinker - you probably aren't (like imposter syndrome), and just need to learn to slow the room down. Doing so will help you, others behind you, and those in front of you.hereme888 2 minutes ago

on: AI coding
I'm so confused. So now you're an elitist gatekeeper to the world of programming? I entered w/o knowledge, and my apps are pretty useful to myself and some others.
They're not "little pieces of software". They are fully-working, self-contained,
apps with lots of unique code. Some are better than many apps that existed 10 years ago, but you seem to resent that. Also, whatever you do is relatively "high-level" programming on top of the work of those who created hardware and engineered programming languages, compilers and SDKs.lisbbb 2 minutes ago

I had a similar issue with lenses. Those appointments are hell and counter-productive. Firstly, it's a difficult thing to do under pressure. Secondly the more you attempt it the more your eyes get irritated and the more difficult it becomes. Eventually I managed to sort of just shove it in when the optometrist wasn't looking. Then they gave me some to take home and I was able to practice in a less stressful environment and finally got the hang of it. Saying that, if I stop for a while and then go back to them it can take a couple of days to get the reflexes to slow down again. If you can order a pack online without a prescription I'd say it's relatively safe to do that and practice at home provided they've already explained the hygiene basics and you know how to put them in/out, you're just having issues with the blinking.henearkr 3 minutes ago

You just proved my point: you use the radical variant of the meaning of the word "socialist", without even acknowledging that it is not the only one.Have you heard of SocDem, or "social democracy"?It is everywhere.

A lot of the comment seem to ignore Hotelling's Law [0].When applied to politics the game plan is:- In a two party system, start by framing your message to the middle of your party- This means you capture everyone from middle of your party to the political middle of the population (we'll call these the "closest to center") AND get a few folks farther out from your middle- This will help you win the "primaries"- After that, you want to slowly drift towards the middle of the population. This allows you to pull most of the "close to center" folks from your party AND people from the other sideNOTE: the other side should be doing the exact same but coming from the other direction.Now, people may also ask "Why not start out in the population middle??". The reason is that you:a. don't win any primaries this wayb. you get "crowded out" by the winners of the two party primaries0 - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotelling%27s_lawduxup 4 minutes ago

Let’s just keep assuming they’re simple-minded maniacs foaming at the mouth driven by blind hate, with no valid concerns or perspectives. Let’s also keep marginalizing any populists that bubble up on the left to ensure our dispassionate resolve to return to the status quo. It’s proven very successful over the past decade, so what more validation do we need? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it!justinyee17 5 minutes ago

on: How do you build friendships online?
I can share some thoughts, as I pondered the same question a few years back, as someone in solitude for much of my life. Social media seemed like the go-to answer, but due to past mistakes and experiences with mental health, I'd become starkly against ever participating in it again.Through endless searching, I eventually discovered the existence of "digital pen pal" apps, where you can send letters to people directly.Some correspondences lasted just a few weeks, and many went nowhere. I got a lot of copy-pasted, two-sentence letters. But two have lasted over two years and counting. We've shared life stories, triumphs and adversity, and photos of everyday life, even a world apart.People reach out because they want to know about you, and vice versa. A lack of point systems and an audience watching means less ulterior motives, and with bio information, you can get to know someone before you even start corresponding.Interpersonal relations often grow from proximity, repetition, and shared experiences. But online, I feel it's mostly just posting a broadcast into a fragmented void. Interactions are motivated by the headline or content, rather than the person, and once the discussion's done, so is the contact.It's the promise of connection gone unfilled. The interactions of one-to-many, many-to-one, largely end up being none-to-none.I think there's sites better tailored to build true connections. But regardless of an overarching system, I think just putting oneself out there (the keyword being "oneself") - in situations to meet people, is the greatest determinator.My friends from penpalling told me they reached out because my bio, describing my journey and stories, stood out to them because they could relate. It was euphoric to hear I wasn't alone in my problems. Asking questions, sharing experiences only deepened the connection.I recently joined HN, partly for these reasons. Ironically, in alignment with these statements, I responded due to the thread's topic and have largely focused on just the ideas.I'm curious to know more about your background - do you have any projects you're working on? What interests do you have outside tech? I notice your "about" section is blank - let's hear more about you!j7ake 5 minutes ago
