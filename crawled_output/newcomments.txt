https://accountinginsights.org/how-to-abbreviate-million-in-...
The abbreviation “M” for million can lead to confusion in finance. Historically, “M” derives from the Latin word “mille,” meaning “thousand.” As such, it has traditionally been used in some accounting or construction contexts to denote a thousand. For example, $5M could historically represent $5,000, creating ambiguity.
To represent one million in finance, the abbreviation “MM” is widely used. This notation originates from “mille mille,” meaning “thousand thousands” in Latin, equating to one million. This clarity makes “MM” a preferred choice in financial statements and reports.
Other abbreviations for million, such as “mn” or “mln,” are also encountered, though less frequently in formal financial documents compared to “MM.” The Financial Times, for example, adopted “mn” for millions to improve accessibility for text-to-speech software. While these alternatives exist, “MM” remains a prevalent and widely understood abbreviation for million in American finance.karmakaze 0 minutes ago

on: Refurb Weekend: Silicon Graphics Indigo² Impact 10...
Where was this machine made?I was using these in the UK at the time and ours were 'Made in Switzerland', which I liked.You mention the Crimson in the article, another machine I knew in period. I was showing someone around one day and they rudely said that it was a 'very large box for a single CPU'.My introduction to SGI was the Indigo and I usually had whatever was latest until I had O2s and a massive Onyx2 with Infinite Reality3. No machines have had the impressive presence that these machines had in period. Although nice hardware has came out since then, nothing just makes civilians drop their jaws in awe and wonder.By analogy, it is like the difference between one of those vast organs that you get in cathedrals and the synthesisers you get in a music shop. Musicians would probably prefer the latter, but normies like me just don't get that wow feeling.Although newer machines were better, I always felt that something was compromised each time. For example, the wonderful OG keyboards and ALPS mice, they got a little bit creaky and plastic over time. It was also the same with cases. I appreciated the design goals of O2 but it was very creaky and there was not the usual choice of video breakout boxes with genloc and all those fun things that we had back then.For reference, my Onyx had 256Mb of RAM and 64Mb of graphics RAM, if I can remember correctly. This was less than the 384Mb I had in Indigo2 machines, which we had to boost due to a software memory leak just to get the runtime. This level of RAM was huge in period (when office PCs had 32K of video RAM, if you were lucky) and yet today a single tab running YouTube will take more than a gig of RAM.I would like a mini-museum of SGI machines, however, without the hardware specific applications that I used these machines for, I feel that it would be a case of 'never meet your heroes'.ranger_danger 1 minute ago

The media would have a much harder time collecting ad dollars if they didn't use strawman arguments and misrepresentation to lock in an audience.Ask a liberal about conservatives or a conservative about liberals and they have abso-fucking-lutely no idea what the ideals of the other side are. None whatsoever. Thanks silo'd media.atm3ga 1 minute ago

> the US Government is making the decisions they are in order to crush the population into submission.See now you've gone fully off the deep end and betrayed what this is really about - some tinfoil hat conspiratorialising where the US government is out to mind control its population (or something). At least if you aren't hiding behind telling me to read a subversive Socialist novel it saves us both the time of trying to figure out what you really mean.I'm not a fan of the Trump admin, I've never voted for him, and I'm fully aware of the US government's long history of pulling dodgy shit vis-a-vis medical research (pretending to treat syphilis in black people, anyone?) Nevertheless, I don't see everything that happens in the world, even things involving US law, as necessarily emanating from farsighted and devious governmental planning. If anything the last 10 years have demonstrated that federal governments are less competent and more inept than we ever thought they were.tjpnz 3 minutes ago

>Not in trouble, it's the Chinese and Russians money laundering. Every Russian has had their accounts suspended, this was about half a year ago, now they are slowly doing the Chinese and Brits too. Vietnam is not much better, also suspending all foreigners accounts until you can prove you have a trc here.They also do this in Japan. A minor inconvenience to have to resubmit paperwork every five years, but necessary to prevent ex-residents selling their accounts to fraudsters (yes - this was actually happening).jajko 3 minutes ago

Unlimited amount? Sure, I can easily see some non-standard situation where its very beneficial (ie once-a-decade home reconstruction). But only on a limited account having only the amount I don't mind exposing, which normally is very low.adrr 3 minutes ago

The conservative masquerading as an independent blaming the left for fake issues of why as you can't support them. Trope is as old as time.Strongest economies are from blue states.
Poorest are red states.

on: PyPI mirror proxy that injects code and bypasses p...
Yes, if you control the index, you can lie to pip about what the package's hash should be. This is why you have to opt in to using a different index, and why the connection to PyPI has been properly secured since forever (https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/425 ; note the date).Once pip supports installation from a PEP 751 lockfile (should be very soon, by my understanding), presumably this won't work, unless the lockfile is already compromised.The clearly AI-generated README is also confused about how this works. It claims:> Intercepts package index requests and rewrites URLs to point to the malicious mirrorbut it's actually implementing a malicious mirror by forwarding requests to PyPI and then serving a modified version of the PyPI result. "Preserves and updates SHA256 hashes for modified packages" is also an incoherent description; preserving something and modifying it are mutually incompatible.macawfish 4 minutes ago

on: EU court rules nuclear energy is clean energy
Source please. That truly does not make sense given that renewable subsidies are being phased out around the world and renewables are the fastest growing energy source in human history.In contrast nuclear power is backsliding, and the few projects which get green lit have insanely large subsidies attached.dylan604 5 minutes ago

The reason is stated! The source article links to the request they sent to the court, explaining in detail why the EPA is doing this. Perhaps you think they’re not being honest, but Occam’s Razor doesn’t demand that we should spin grand unifying theories of government behavior in preference to evaluating the stated motivations of individual actions.nickjj 5 minutes ago

on: Pass: Unix Password Manager
I didn't like the idea of pushing a pass git repo to a private GitHub repo.For now I just temporarily drop the DB onto Google Drive manually (through the web site since I don't use the app) to quickly share it to the other devices without worrying about USB cables or running native apps on each device.I'm hesitent to use "sync" type of tools that run on each device because I don't have a central server and I really don't like the idea of running any type of cloud hosted network storage desktop app on each device to have a network drive.We'll see how it goes I suppose.I wonder if it'll involve writing a tiny shell script that I run on my desktop machine to handle syncing it across devices and it always ensures the latest copy makes its way onto each device. That would allow me to freely add new entries on any device and worry about syncing it across devices when I am 100% sure all devices are on the same local network. I think that will work out in the end.I don't need real-time replication because if I'm on the road using my phone, I can't mind my desktop being outdated until I get back home.lordleft 5 minutes ago

on: Writing an operating system kernel from scratch
I will never not find this kind of project incredibly impressive. It’s interesting to think that Linux, after all, is really just the kernel — and yet getting that work done paved the way to getting an open source version of Unix installed on billions of machines. Great stuff!scarface_74 5 minutes ago

You didn’t need “sources of information”.
Trump was in office for four years before he was re-elected.
It’s copium to think that people aré ignorant when in actuality, they are actively
hostile to minorities, non straight, the college educated and non Christians.They would rather feel the fallout of Republican policies
as long as it doesn’t help or actively
hurts people not like them.
In my former home state GA, the Republican governor spent years
and tens of millions of dollars trying to get the Hyundai plant to GA that would have created 8500 jobs directly and no telling how many indirect jobs.ICE invaded the plant and the opportunity is now lost potentially.
The governor
still can’t bring himself to criticize the President and the Republicans in GA are cheering the raid.
