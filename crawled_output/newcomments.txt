on: How to get samples back from Mars
Afaik it is very unlikely anything from mars can affect us in any way. All our bacteria and viruses have millions of years of coevolution.Best example is how almost all cat and dog infections do not affect humans. And cats and dogs are mammals!blackjack_ 0 minutes ago

I don't know why this isn't talked about that often, but a lot of people who smoke weed end up needing to smoke weed to be able to eat. Which probably is part of the thing that leads to reduced BMI.andy99 0 minutes ago

on: Betty Crocker broke recipes by shrinking boxes
What a beautiful story. This - generally, a journey through the drift of recipe fidelity over time, and specifically grounded in your story - would make a great book. Mark Kurlansly has some lovely books that weave the history of recipes with history generally. His history of Salt is truly captivating.IncreasePosts 0 minutes ago

on: My thoughts on renting versus buying
Sure, but on the other hand, when you have a mortgage (generally fixed interest rate for 20+ years), your biggest expense is guaranteed to stay static. What will your rent be in 10 years? Who the heck knows?kuschku 1 minute ago

Would you swap your $2M house for a $2M motorhome?No.
Homes flucuate in value but could go up.
Motorhomes do not appreciate in value.
Motorhomes are significantly more costly to maintain, especially the expensive ones.
I would instead buy a much more affordable home and a very affordable flat bed off-road truck and bolt a camper add-on on top of it.
I could then take said camper to many more remote places and more scenic views usign less fuel and not having to navigate a bus.
Oh yeah, the truck with simple modifications can get 25mpg.
The $2M bus conversion will get about 6mpg on a good day.malnourish 2 minutes ago

I would kill for this for when I’m buying fresh produce at the shops. Right now I just raw dog the produce into my basket as putting 4 apples into a plastic bag to ease the weighing and transport home seems like a selfish thing to do to the environment, but something that starts to break down soon after that sounds great.xbar 3 minutes ago

Try having vision worse than 20/200 and getting around without glasses. When I traveled, pre-contacts, I always packed a spare and a repair kit. With contacts, I pack one pair of glasses, a repair kit and spare contacts, its essentially the same prep and experience. Except now I have peripheral vision and can wear whatever sunglasses I have on hand. They also don't fog up like glasses do, which makes the transition in and out of buildings in hot, humid climates where AC is prevalent less annoying.cjensen 4 minutes ago

The tollhouse recipe is amazingly fragile. Slight variations in temperature can make the cookies "go flat" or end up with a thick skin. No surprise there is a variation of outcomes using older ovens that were very imprecise.kjkjadksj 4 minutes ago

on: Writing an operating system kernel from scratch
Yep, agreed. Don't get me wrong, the Intel/AMD docs are amazing. But even getting the hardware to a usable state (where I define usable as "something that can enumerate PCI devices on the system, even without PCIe") is an absolute pain that really just shouldn't exist. I know that RISC-V ahs it's own tough spots but... IMO it's a lot faster to get up and running with because it doesn't have 10000 execution modes with tons of different requirements you need to do for each mode, and on and on and on and on. (Yes, I'm exaggerating a bit.)malshe 4 minutes ago

on: My thoughts on renting versus buying
> Here where I live the minimum price for rent is monthly mortgage installement, meaning that you'll pay for rent at least as much as you'd pay for mortgage.When you own, the mortgage payment is the floor on your monthly cash outlay. by contrast, when you rent, the rent is the ceiling on your monthly cash outlay. So even when they are identical, homeownership is way costlier because of all the other costs one "forgets" to consider while making this comparison. HOA dues, home insurance, property tax, maintenance, etc. add up to thousands of dollars each year. As a renter, you don't have to consider any of these beyond your rent.3willows 4 minutes ago
