> different case by a different organization means this case is also political.It's the same issue - the DOJ is going after companies and their ads. In SpaceX's case, the ads said citizen/LPR only due to export control, and DOJ got mad that it would exclude asylees and refugees for some of these positions which may not actually have export control requirements. Your complaint is also about ads and whether they are in print media or online etc. If you think that ads in print media violate the law, which itself predates the internet and the tech industry at large, you need to prove that in a court of law. The government doesn't think that there is positive EV in taking it to trial, and hence settles. You, as an individual, can still pursue a civil suit if you are injured.>For all I know you might not even know what does "good faith" meanThere are thousands of bogus laws in the books and the government is not your friend. Good faith in this context means doing the minimal amount of work needed to comply with the law. Innocent until proven guilty, and the government has the burden of proof. This is how I view all interactions with the state.ZhongDongLong 0 minutes ago

Life saver! New version lacks OpenKeychain integration (they discuss in issues that it is also no longer maintained). Abandoned version of Android Password Store had some issues with embedded PGP manager and was not working for me.

> Isn’t it obvious that a heart attack could be caused by a myriad of issues?I think you not only missed the point but also are doubling down on your mistake by conflating correlation with causality. You don't conclude that burger craving is caused by owning a car by observing drive-through restaurants.nice_byte 2 minutes ago

Doing KYC is somewhat against the whole idea of like "no government involvement" but it doesn't negate that the government controls the currency.You lost all interest because Bitcoin became attractive to people who deal with companies who insist on KYC? How is that in any relation to the underlying code or mantra that Bitcoin is about?gavmor 3 minutes ago

> hearing it from a host on the most popular “news” station in the country, with neither of his co-hosts even pausing to go “uh, haha, wait now” is… something else.Meanwhile, another Fox News host has been promoted to Secretary of "War", and is busy drone striking random boats and straight up murdering people.While yet another Fox News host has been charging people with crimes that juries refuse to indict because they're so preposterous.It seems we have a serious problem with Fox News hosts and podcaster bros running this government and directing policy. Remember, Fox News isn't just talking to its audience -- it's talking to the President, he watches religiously. He pays more attention to them than all his cabinet and advisors combined.Aloisius 3 minutes ago

on: Recreating the US/* time zone situation
The reason why cities get entries is because the regions they are in sometime after 1970 changed when DST starts/ends and those need to be recorded in the timezone database.Boise has its own entry is because in 1974, the Emergency Daylight Time Act that shifted when DST began in Southern Idaho and eastern Oregon. Boise is the largest city in the region.Technically, if you're in Salt Lake City, you should be using America/Denver, not Boise because of this, otherwise if you say, opened a calendar from 1974, everything will be off by an hour.So if Salt Lake City wants an entry, Utah change when DST begins.westurner 4 minutes ago

on: High Altitude Living – 8,000 ft and above (2021)
Very asymmetrically, too. There's a (relatively) small impact on cooking grains and pasta and stuff, but even at 5000 ft where I live beans can easily take 2x as long to cook. It's a challenge.WalterBright 6 minutes ago

on: High Altitude Living – 8,000 ft and above (2021)
My dad visited Machu Picchu. He was doing poorly and the guides put him on oxygen. They were well prepared for it, as it happens a lot and is not very predictable.It's at 8,000 feet.I remember staying overnight at Estes Park, 7500 feet. I got a headache. I didn't try anything strenuous.I recall reading about Mt Everest climbs. Even on supplemental oxygen, your brain measurably dies a little. No thanks. People who climb it repeatedly are, in my not-so-humble opinion, idiots.Void_ 6 minutes ago

I have mixed thoughts about audio journaling.At first I was in love - I made an app around Whisper transcription model the weekend it came out. (Still working on it - https://whispermemos.com)But when I try to read those recordings, they seem long and uninteresting.As if recording audio captures too much noise.Maybe using this Socratic method will help me record more focused entries, but for now I’m back to keyboard.What are your thoughts on this?nurettin 6 minutes ago

This is funny, at one point I became convinced 50mm is too "boring" of a focal length, and almost sold mine. Then I realised some of my best shots were taken at 50mm. It's a good neutral perspective

on: Why you’d issue a branded stablecoin
It's a good question - Stripe's Stablecoin Account documentation is good reference here (they denominate balances in USDB, one of these "custom stablecoins" from Bridge): https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/stablecoin-financial-accounts..."It’s always backed one-to-one by the equivalent value of US dollars held in cash and short-duration money market funds at BlackRock."So while there are other (potentially novel) sorts of counterparty risks - the backing is definitely more robust than (and pretty much entirely decoupled from) Bitcoin/the rest of the crypto sphere, and is closer to dropping funds off in a Fidelity money market.Another good (early - 2023) read on this topic: "There are now two types of PayPal dollars, and one is better than the other

on: Pass: Unix Password Manager
There's a ton of positivity here, but on the balance there are some significant issues with pass that I think bear mention:- The fact that it's essentially unstructured data makes it hard to work with generically. If you have a username + password and need to use those in a script, you'll need to implement your own parser in your shell language in every script you need it in.- `pass generate` to generate new passwords, maybe thanks to the above, replaces everything in the pass value by default.
So if you had e.g. a password + secret question answers, if you use `generate` to get a new password it'll wipe out your secret question answers.- It's very difficult to review history. I stopped using it a while ago, but since everything's encrypted `git diff` won't give you anything useful and IIRC the command line tools were very hard to use for reviewing/restoring passwords when you mess up updates, etc.- The name makes it nearly impossible to search forI've been working on something similar... although with slightly larger scope (intended to be used within containers/sandboxes) https://github.com/andrewbaxter/passworthpetre 9 minutes ago

on: EU court rules nuclear energy is clean energy
Not only designed decades ago (which the PWR also was) but the designers also cut corners, ignored its faults and pushed it through politically because it was cheap and the Soviet governments could meet their 5 year targets easier. Early incidents were treated with cover-ups."The RBMK was considered by some in the Soviet Union to be already obsolete shortly after the commissioning of Chernobyl unit 1. Aleksandrov and Dollezhal did not investigate further or even deeply understand the problems in the RBMK, and the void coefficient was not analyzed in the manuals for the reactor. Engineers at Chernobyl unit 1 had to create solutions to many of the RBMK's flaws such as a lack of protection against no feedwater supply. Leningrad and Chernobyl units 1 both had partial meltdowns that were treated, alongside other nuclear accidents at power plants, as state secrets and so were unknown even to other workers at those same plants."https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RBMKatonse 9 minutes ago

on: Pass: Unix Password Manager
I store my passwords on an encrypted file partition sqlite database. My script grabs the pass and immediately closes the partition afterwards.You can also just encrypt your passwords into individual encrypted files (one for each password) and have your script clear the gpg agent after a passfile is decrypted.More
