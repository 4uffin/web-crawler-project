I have a different pubkey per device. I store all the pubkeys in the pass repo, and have a shell script to re-encrypt everything with those keys. So when I add a new device, I just need to add its pubkey, and then re-encrypt on an existing device.metalman 0 minutes ago

It would be far more facinating to fund something like the ongoing construction of a true mideval castle in France, where they are re creating the teqcniques used by building and then testing for accuracy, and refining there methods by letting thins weather and be used in daily operations to be able to compare wearmarks and longevity to original archiological evidence, in France there work and workers have directly been used in the rebuilding of the great chapell burned down in paris a decade ago.
So a full on mesoptaimian city on the banks of the Euphraties, and maybe we can find out what on earth

Sorry, but yes, when your app crashes there could be two issues. The C++ library that you use is shit, or your engineers don't understand the underlying concept of allocating/deallocating things because for Swift they had never to learn them. With Rust the code just wouldn't compile at all, that the only difference.larrry 1 minute ago

I’ve been building up animations for a main character sprite. I’m hoping one day AI can help me make small changes quickly (apply different hairstyles mainly). So far I haven’t seen anything promising either.Otherwise I have to touch up a hundred or so images manually for each different character style… probably not worth ittaurath 1 minute ago

My advice would be to not listen to anyone who’s primary advice is to avoid one of the most commonly in demand skillsets and denigrates everyone who practices it as being expert beginners.TiddoLangerak 2 minutes ago

The beauty of pass is that there's a distinction between giving access to the encrypted vault vs giving access to decryption, and you can leverage this.How I've been doing this is that I have 2 (sets of) backup people. The first set has access to the repo, but can't decrypt. The second set can decrypt (i.e. I have their pubkeys imported), but don't have access to the repo. I've chosen the people such that it's unlikely they collude against me, but in case something happens it's likely they'll be able to get in touch with each other.There's also other possible approaches: e.g. instead of building a dead man's switch based on the encryption, you can build a dead man's switch based on the data. I.e. you'll use their pubkeys for encryption, but the repo itself is behind a dead man's switch.Rendello 2 minutes ago

I first learned about La Paz and its even higher-elevation sibling city El Alto from this video [1] about their new cable car transportation network [1][2]. I then spent a few hours on Google Maps and Youtube looking at El Alto up close, what a fascinating and different world up there.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5126u88E7Ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mi_Telef%C3%A9ricosafety1st 3 minutes ago

Paper is best. I love flipping through my notebooks. I do it a lot more often, even if only to find the next empty page. I revise my paper sketches a lot more often because I see them again and again.Digital is faster and more convenient. My journal is in obsidian. My work notes are on my iPad. Everything is synced and backed up. However it's missing the chronological anthology that is a paper notebook.That being said, I try not to overthink things. The map is not the territory, and my notes are not a perfect capture of my mind at a given time. I don't need to perfectly observe and process everything. Sometimes it's good to just live in the moment.Nervhq 3 minutes ago

on: Why you’d issue a branded stablecoin
Aren't futures all backed by some financial entity? The first problem is it's a third party. That party may go bankrupt. Plus, it's probably in another country. McDonald's is in all the countries.It's also best when it's backed by the company honoring it. If Ronald Bank decides that they're one day no longer in partnership with McDonald's, they might choose to swap it with Whoppers, which are not quite equivalent, but that's a flexibility that some people might want to have.I don't want a thousand Big Macs worth of futures though. I just want maybe 10. Or a hundred. If I'm broke or get labeled a terrorist or refugee, I can trade one for food. If say, any McDonald's accepts them, they'd be more liquid than USDC.Plus McDonald's has plans lasting for decades. My futures may no longer be valid in 6 years.fulafel 4 minutes ago

>To be explicit: one of the "features" this advertises is equivalent to saying "if you stop compiling your code with `-Wall`, you don't have to deal with all those pesky warnings!"You're still not being explicit. Are you referring to the error recovery? Do you disagree that this is useful in real world applications? A C++ parser with `-Wall` would do error recovery and keep going on syntax errors.ackfoobar 5 minutes ago

My question is a few math operations away from "how much batteries capacity can we deploy to support how much % of renewables in the short-medium term, while still having a stable grid". My "100%" phrasing was sloppy, no need to index too much on it.Since you're in the industry, maybe you can answer this question and change my mind.nicbou 6 minutes ago

I also find that the act of writing regularly highlights some patterns, and some unaddressed emotions.You might find yourself writing about the same thing for a few days and notice how it affects your feelings. You may also notice reluctance in committing certain thoughts to paper because you won't admit them to yourself.Having prompts to highlight such things is a good idea.FirmwareBurner 6 minutes ago

GPG is a big detractor, at least for me. Working with the GPG agent is usually a subpar, if not outright confusing, experience. I’d happily take a version that uses ssh-agent instead to achieve the same.pessimizer 6 minutes ago

Reconstruction is great provided archaeologists are done with the site and at least some of the tourism revenue generated is put towards archaeology.Ancient Mesopotamia is, in my view, one of the most exciting fields out there, simply because their written records are imperishable.
There's thousands of years of history, not pre-history, there.
Much of it has already been discovered but, for want of money, not yet fully studied.
Not yet deciphered.
Not yet understood.We know the approximate locations of important cities that have yet to be found.
We know roughly where they are, but they're not in easy places to access due to remoteness as well as political instability and violence.
We currently only have records from other places to tell us they exist, but we could find entire libraries and hear from these ancient people in their own words.There are few other frontiers in all of archaeology that offer such potential for gaining intimate knowledge of ancient human societies.
Anything that can inject a little much-needed funding into the field is welcome.motorest 7 minutes ago

People are wanting to make a living by making art, not to get rich.I highly recommend reading the book I mentioned as you don’t seem to have a particularly nuanced understanding of the actual struggles at play.Perhaps an analogy you’ll understand is what happens to the value of a developer’s labour when that labour is in many ways replicated by AI and big AI companies actively work to undermine what makes your labour different by aggressively marketing that anyone can so what you so with their tools.krater23 7 minutes ago

You may spend a few hours struggling with the borrow checker, but that saves you countless days of debugging highly non-trivial defects, especially in a larger codebase.How often do you had issues like that in the last 10 years of your work? Questionable if it's really cheaper for everyone. Other question, is there any really large Rust codebase out there thats older than 10 years? That had time to gather crust of tons of developers to compare with the appropriate C++ codebases? I don't think so.rbanffy 7 minutes ago
