I think Harris was a good candidate who did stand for something, but she didn't get enough time to run her own campaign :)But I'm not interested in having a "she wasn't pure enough for my brand of politics" debate, I was only
pointing out that almost half of those who voted did in fact vote for her – not Trump.tsoukase 1 minute ago

While in decline or development of a country, education comes first, the rest sectors follow and currency as world reserve comes last.We seem to be at the middle stage for US and China, the former going down, the latter up. Top world currency change will come sometime.atombender 1 minute ago

Pilocarpine has been already approved in the US since 2021 under the trade name Vuity (pilocarpine hydrochloride 1.25%), which was discussed on HN [1]. Another version, Qlosi (pilocarpine HC 0.4%), was approved in 2023.It seems that this formulation differs by adding naproxen, an NSAID. I'm not sure why they believe this is needed.[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29509163more_corn 1 minute ago

on: You’re a slow thinker. Now what?
Now take your time. Most of the important thoughts in life are ones you can take your time with. It’s all good as long as you get there eventually.In fact we might all be slow thinkers. Wisdom might mean thinking slowly and carefully, with acknowledgment of as many external factors as possible.Heck that might be what life is about, getting to the highest possible point of wisdom even if it takes a long time.ffsm8 1 minute ago

1984 playing out in front of us. Again.Politicians like Peter Hummelgaard are ghouls. They want their eyes in your home, watching you at all moments. And then they want to control what you do and see and think.Defending our liberties and privacy is a never-ending battle.edent 2 minutes ago

It's really hard to say whether something like that is impossible.I'm not aware of, for example, Google's private signing keys for Android being leaked.
Sure, plenty of CAs have been breached - but not all. That suggests it is possible to key these keys secure.blibble 2 minutes ago

If you add an AGENTS.md, the AI agent will work more efficiently, and there will be far fewer problems like the ones you’re facing. You can include sections such as Security, coding style guidelines, writing unit tests, etc.buildbot 2 minutes ago

The PA-RISC processor are really cool - the C8900 has a 64MB external shared L2, and a 768KB I & D cache per core. That's more I & D cache than any modern processor I am aware of, and more last level cache than basically anything but an AMD X3D or the last 5-10 years of X86 server chips. It's much slower of course than any modern cache.The older 8500 has an article available with a die shot: https://ardent-tool.com/CPU/docs/MPR/19971117/111505.pdf
It's like 75% cache even back then. (Fast SRAM With Integrated CPU is extremely accurate, lol).cprayingmantis 3 minutes ago

Are there any labs in the US that a regular joe could use to get their water tested? I’ve got quite a few properties with natural springs and I can send the water to get tested for bacteria and mineral content but I don’t know of anywhere that tests for PFAS.ponector 3 minutes ago

I find this a curious hypothesis, to say the least.So I'm a marathon runner (ran a 3:08 marathon this morning, actually, at age 55). The carbs I eat are neither excessive, nor low fibre.And all the endurance athletes I know are extremely aware of their diets and the importance of eating the right mix of high quality foods.alde 3 minutes ago

Yuck your use of "socialist".Yes I know that in English-speaking countries, especially the USA, it is often a shortcut for communist tyranny.But for f*ck's sake, that obliterates anything political that is driven towards increasing the overall happiness of the society, and not focusing on increasing the material wealth, acknowledging the disconnect between the two.And yes the above uses the adjective "socialist", so that would be totally lost in your usage of the word.EGreg 3 minutes ago

It’s right there in the name: Chat Control. Take them at their word!Look at Australia’s “hacking” bill. It was about letting the government hack (take over) your account and post as you.

on: Read to forget
I highlight as a way to categorize my annotations. I highlight in Zotero as I go, and in the highlight's comment section briefly jot down why (e.g. something to follow up on, or whether this reminded me of something else it contrasts with). I dedicate a certain colour to "background references I should have", another to ~ "things I disagree with" etc., which I find useful when coming back over the paper to type up my notes.In a sense the highlighting is just a way to localize my thoughts to a particular passage of the text, and the colours (or even highlighting at all) are secondary.There's some considerable duplication of effort (notes in Zotero, then I type up notes in Obsidian, then also extract out some of those ideas into their own files). But, much like the recent posts about "outsourcing thinking" and GP noting that people sometimes do nothing with their highlights, I find that the work is useful for understanding and remembering.Out of interest, why have you been considering Logseq?mvanbaak 4 minutes ago

Just because something is in a bill, doesn’t mean it has any chance of getting passed.It’s not the sort of thing that would go through reconciliation and thus it has roughly zero chance of becoming law anytime soon.layer8 4 minutes ago

The worst case is when only approved hardware and software will be legal, and every level of infrastructure will be enforcing that. You can say good bye to decentralized solutions then.Note how Apple is already a bit like that, banning certain torrenting apps even from alternative app stores [0]. I’m just mentioning that as a demonstration of feasibility of such closed and controlled ecosystems.[0] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45098411convolvatron 4 minutes ago

on: Writing an operating system kernel from scratch
that is a pain. oswiki is a good resource, and there are also a huge number of examples. but it still takes a day. context save and restore and interrupts is another speed bump. but its no different than any other development banging your head against the wall exercise, and its pretty rewarding to have smoothed all that over and go to town on bespoke scheduler design.fruitworks 5 minutes ago

>If the message is flagged, it can be sent over an encrypted HTTPS channel to authoritiesokay, but how do you prevent me from intercepting that communication.Or even running my own copy of the local model and determing ahead of time whether it will trip the alarm. If the attacker has access to the model, they can effectively make a GAN to modify images to get past the filter.cluckindan 5 minutes ago

PFAS were first determined to be harmful by internal industry scientists in the early 1960s, with documented evidence showing animal toxicity (including liver damage) and warnings of human health risks by the late 1960s and 1970s.npteljes 5 minutes ago
