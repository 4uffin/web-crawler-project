What an appalling comment. You can’t possibly justify what you’re doing so you pretend it’s something “the left” did first. Did the left deport students because they wrote an op-ed article, or went to a protest? Did senior administration officials call for jailing opponents for thought crimes?manwe150 0 minutes ago

Apparently there is no known limit, so we could vaccinate for everything, repeatedly, without risking forgetting. Unlike getting the illness or antibiotic use, where there is limits and fragility as a possible resultbeeflet 0 minutes ago

The currently latest release of Debian (13.1) ships a broken version of systemd-networkd whichay break networking completely for affected users. Upstream response is less than encouraging: https://bugs.debian.org/1112535> There was absolutely no need to disturb RT and waste your time, as you have much more important things to take care of, as this is just a minor issue with a particular corner case of a custom config of an optional component. Anybody who is unable to deal with that should just stick to the default Debian components. The next stable update in ~2 months will contain a fix.freshtake 1 minute ago

The problem is that our thoughts, opinions, and ultimately actions are the product of our exposure. Social media gives a small number of companies (and their algorithms) unparalleled and unchecked control over our exposure.We should be educating children at a young age about the benefits and risks of social media. We haven't adapted the way we educate society in light of massive tech changes.This will likely be a topic that future humans look back on and wonder why we did this to ourselves.Fade_Dance 1 minute ago

Except there weren't really any mass harassment, rape and death threat, and firing campaigns being coordinated against ordinary people for not sufficiently mourning someone. Most of the "cancel culture" stuff was overblown nonsense, the few real events were against massive public figures credibly accused of heinous things like Weinstein.Pretending this is in any way equivalent betrays either an intense naivete or a supporter of this pre-pogrom behavior.Aunche 1 minute ago

> I am prepared to accept aspects of social media are bad. Clearly identify why and how and perhaps we can make progress addressing each thing.Companies intentionally design social media to be as addictive as possible, which should be enough to declare them as bad. Should we also identify each chemical in a vape and address each one individually as well before banning them for children? I think such a ban for social media would probably be overkill, but it should not be controversial to ban phone use in school.KPGv2 1 minute ago

on: Safe C++ proposal is not being continued
> Geoff's stuff is mostly about heuristics.That's not true at all.- The bounds safety part of it prevents those C operations that Fil-C or something like it would dynamically check. You can to use hardened API instead.- The cast safety part of it prevents C casts except if they're obviously safe.- The lifetime safety part of it forces you to use WebKit's smart pointers except when you have an overlooking root.Those are type safety rules. It's disingenuous to call them heuristics.It is true, however, that Geoff's rules don't go to 100% because:- There are nasty corners of C that aren't covered by any of those rules.- WebKit still has <10% ish code that isn't opted into those rules.- WebKit has JITs.beeflet 2 minutes ago

My first thought was unfortunately wether the UK and other Western nations would copy this to build their own Firewalls. To be honest i still don't think it's a goal anyone is actively working towards and that's a bit of an hyperbolic take. But the truth is that we are moving more towards such a system then
we are moving away.My second thought is how badly Chinese communism must be doing that they need such a massive effort in order to prevent their citizens from accessing information and voicing dissent. We are lucky to be living in such a free society. Internet seems to be losing the battle against government interference and censorship and that is more of a bad
thing then a good thing.cramsession 3 minutes ago

I get my IP through work, but another way of obtaining one would be subscribing to a business account with a regular ISP. Normally, this also allows you to set a reverse DNS. You will likely have to pay more for your Internet, but considering that you won't have to pay for any cloud service anymore, you will probably still come out ahead and gain a huge amount of sovereignty over your computing. A VPS could be an option, but many (cheap ones) may have tainted IPs or outright filter the SMTP port.staticautomatic 4 minutes ago

on: ‘Overworked, underpaid’ humans train Google’s AI
Curious about attempting something like this in my area as well since I’m remote. Are you doing both or does one have to give way to the other eventually?Also im seeing the same trend as you at my company, roles replaced overseas while people only focus on AI taking the jobs i think this is the more sinister thing happening quietly (by that i mean not getting much news coverage)plaidfuji 5 minutes ago

on: Is This Thing On?
The thing I've yet to grasp about the AI hype is that I thoroughly enjoy thinking. The last thing I would want to offload on to a machine is my thinking.Even really hard software problems (for me) bring me joy when I finally understand enough to determine an appropriate solution.Maybe it's because I largely identify myself through my capacity for both abstract and concrete thought.andrewinardeer 5 minutes ago

on: Recreating the US time zone situation
Even abbreviations have issues. PST (UTC+8) is also Philippine Standard Time. EST could mean Eastern Standard Time in Australia, granted that nowadays is AEST.Timezones are such a headache. Obviously even UTC for a location varies depending on the time of year.Even the International Space Station shifted timezones from Houston time to UTC+0.Curiosity and Perseverance's clocks are UTC but operations run on LMST (local mean solar time) Gale Crater and LMST Jezero Crater- their landing locations. That point is moot until humans start spinning up VMs on Mars which they will one day.anigbrowl 5 minutes ago

Says a lot that the very first person listed on that 'charliesmurders.com' site isn't condemning or mocking
Kirk at all but just expressing anxiety about the likelihood of a political backlash following his death. Even the people on 4chan were expressing confusion about this and saying her remarks seemed wholly innocuous.atmavatar 6 minutes ago

Our entire society suffers because a bunch of people want to freeload on mediaThe freeloaders also include the copyright holders.
Copyright was originally 28 years, but now it's life of the author plus 70 years, which from a consumer's perspective is effectively indefinite.The purpose of copyright was to secure a limited monopoly so creators can profit off their works and be incentivized to create more.
Nowadays, the copyright is no longer limited, and the copyright holders are most often not those creating the works.
The social contract with copyright has long since been broken.zamalek 6 minutes ago

One reason is that the JIT needs info on the types passed to the method, which are only available after a few calls. Per the article, a+b could refer to any type of a and b. The only way to know what was used is profiling.almostgotcaught 6 minutes ago

The style of thinking in this piece is interesting but relies, understandably, on all the historical precedents and the rationalizations around them. But it’s different this time :). One way I think it actually is different is this: we don’t really understand how this thing, created by humans, really works. What other advancement has that property?
I can’t think of one. Perhaps certain important medicines?
Other new technologies: nuclear power, solar cells, etc., say, were fully engineered by a scientific understanding that was basically complete. Things like locomotives, or flight, or even the internet were fully understood in scientific and engineering terms.
They were extrapolations.
Forseeing how people would use it was, of course, difficult, and that is shared with AI.But it does seem a singular property of AI (this generation anyway) that even though “we” made it, we don’t understand it. That it works so well (e.g. next token prediction at scale) is unexpected even by the people who did it (at least that’s my relatively uninformed take … there’s a great book of scientific history to be written on that topic imo). In that sense AI is almost like an alien intelligence that landed here. It’s more of a discovery than an invention. Maybe superconductivity or quantum phenomena are analogues.In any case, what is the consequence of this for predicting how it will play out?More
