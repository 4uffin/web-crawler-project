on: Ask HN: Is GPT-5 a regression, or is it just me?
I saw the significant difference in gpt5. If someone were using mostly or just gpt4 before, then it might be a culture shock of difference type situation.Me who actively uses claude, gemini, perplexity, and a whole gamut of local LLMs.The personality of the models are different and so when gpt5 came along, it wasnt really a surprise to me.m-hodges 0 minutes ago

No. I hold my reaction even with OP’s “given”. You can, in fact, read a text more than once, given the number of compelling works and the limited time available to us.mapontosevenths 0 minutes ago

That may just be a regional thing. I certainly couldn't name a single X league player.Regardless, she was certainly more famous than some spy whose job required that he not be famous or even memorable. Right choice or not, Biden likely just made the choice that got him the most positive attention, as one does when they're a politician.qwertygnu 0 minutes ago

When I was in college I bought an iMac G4, threw Debian on it, and used it for homework. I wrote a lot of OCaml on that thing but didn't do much web browsing because the lack of hardware graphics acceleration and 700Mhz clock made the then-modern web a bit of a struggle.tuna74 0 minutes ago

Saying people that confess they *say they were only there because of AA* are obviously only there because of AS is a pretty reasonable point. Linking to the video (with someone’s angry wrapper) directly: https://x.com/alluring_nyc/status/1965931096539017536?s=46I wasn’t aware they said they were there because of AA, this is worthwhile information.ysnp 1 minute ago

Everyone is on their own journey and there are so many reasons a person might think a particular way.The comment you are responding to is just trying to explain their own situation and say the person who wrote the article might want to investigate a similar experience compared to their own. I read the article as one where someone is exploring and ADHD is would be exploration. I would specify that ADHD inattentive type is the one that it reads most like to me.I don't see why you'd want to knock someone's choice of treatment for a particular condition. You might not see a need for a particular treatment option, but many folks get relief from anxiety or other things such as RSD while being medicated for ADHD. They can make their own decisions.mschuster91 2 minutes ago

> Abuse is way more prevalent than most people realize.Frankly, abuse and childhood trauma has always been a staple of human history. Even in the Bible, so at least a few thousand years ago, physical punishment against children is described. Sexual abuse was rampant as well, the Quran documents marriages at age 9. Wars and all the horrors that came with them were all too common - Europe only got actually peaceful after WW2.Just ask in your own family if you still got really really old people left alive... they will all report from some uncle, aunt or godknowswhat that just went loony. Or tell horror stories about rape, beatings, bullying...Nothing is new, the only thing that is new is that abuse gets called out and, at least in some cases, perps get punished.erikpukinskis 2 minutes ago

> You either build a debug image, so you just have it,It is my understanding that that only gives root to adb, not apps, so no.> or you add your own patches adding this capability (in exactly the same way the project modifies stock aosp), and build it.If we're at the point of patching source trees, then no, we've left the realm of "very easy" behind. Installing Magisk is easy. Building Android from source, let alone patching it, is not.> It's not disconnected from the project, but it's inherently within the project. SURE you can consider these two separate skills, but within the context of "getting the root on the GOS build" it's one. If you don't know how to make it happen, you don't have a skill to safely use it.I really disagree. Knowing when to click the allow button or not is a separate skill from building/patching a ROM from source.> Now let's consider the risks of that, - https://cybernews.com/security/rooted-android-ios-devices-su... - https://www.talsec.app/blog/what-is-rooting-and-how-to-prote...I'd love to, but you'll have to mention what they might be. Both of those links treat root as nearly synonymous with compromise but never bother to explain how that compromise would occur, just 1. root 2. ??? 3. malware. That's fear-mongering, not a threat model.> I mean, if you're a security researcher with a considerable reputation, you can certainly argue with authority, but I don't see the angle.Or, we could avoid Appeal to Authority and talk threat models. The only one I've seen yet in this thread is people claiming that malware can fake out permission dialogs and that this is a problem for root permissions but somehow leaves the rest of Android's permission model in a usable state, which is... an interesting claim.> Is the risk high? The consensus is that it is. I agree, you don't, I'm okay with it.Many people making vague claims might technically be a "consensus" but it's not actually meaningful. If you've got an actual threat model, let's hear it, otherwise there's not much point to this.skinkestek 2 minutes ago

"an opiate"? You do not get constipation from one pill that is "so bad".Plus it depends on the opioid. Hydrocodone and oxycodone for example leaves the system pretty quickly (ER, too), and once it does, you can defecate without issues. Morphine on the other hand causes awful constipation but can be treated with proper diet. Hydrate, plum jam, magnesium citrate, or laxatives if serious. You can skip a dose or two so you can defecate.mapontosevenths 3 minutes ago

> Do you think this was just a coincidence?Yes, and there is no reason to believe otherwise that I am aware of.I provided many quotes showing that Kirk played the race, sexuality, and religion cards frequently. I beleive he did so to provoke rage and engagement, and the evidence seems to support my stance.Can you provide even a single quote that shows Biden considered her lesbianism, blackness, or other 'controversial' characteristics as the deciding factor here? From where I sit it looks like he just did what his constituency demanded. Kirk on the other hand made unsubstantiated claims about all of the above to drive engagement.> I'll pretend to believe you. Let me ask you something else then.I'm only discussing this particular case because you chose it as the most defensible from my long list. Even then, you are struggling to justify the divisive language Kirk chose. Had you chosen the one about black pilots this would be even more open and shut.Kirk wasn't stupid, but he was kind of a jerk.Waterluvian 4 minutes ago

on: Why We Spiral
I think a big part of maturing professionally is how I’ve gotten a better handle on not trusting my gut.He’s here to take my job. The VP knows him and hired him directly. There’s so many signals each week that say I’m right. He’s trying to take credit for a decade of my hard work. He’s going to exploit me and everyone will believe him and not me.The more likely reality: he’s new here and I’ve been here for a decade. He was hired to basically replicate my success for sibling teams. He’s feeling immense pressure. He’s probably terrified of failing. I probably make him feel threatened.
My defensive posture makes this worse.
I give him signals all the time that he probably reads as me wanting him to fail or not liking him.Analemma_ 4 minutes ago

But you and the parent are both ignoring that, in the real world, prototypes constantly (in fact, nearly always) get shipped straight to production and not updated or rewritten, precisely because they solve a pressing problem, and if they solve it well they get real users right away who start bringing up new feature requests and bugs before the prototype can ever be fixed.This was a constant pattern in software engineering even before LLMs, but LLMs are making it much worse, and I think it's very head-in-the-sand behavior to ignore that. It's akin to going "well, you can't blame the Autopilot because the person should have been fully-attentive ready to react at any millisecond". That's not how humans work, and good engineering is supposed to take real-world human behavior into considerationnowittyusername 4 minutes ago

Oh for sure. Ask questions, just not annoying whiteboard questions. Also I hate this “ask us anything” part of the interview. It’s so performative.It should be rephrased as “the jeopardy round” since it’s still about the candidate, but phrased backwards. And it’s not a time for REAL questions, it’s a time to show you’re smart and attentive but not TOO smart, you want the interviewer to feel good about themselves so they can feel good about you.> what my response would beI don’t ask candidates to do anything I wouldn’t put up with. It would be unusual but I would be game (if they were serious). Fundamentally that’s what my fantasy is about: a world where interviewer and interviewee have mutual respect for each other.In the recent past I’ve asked candidates to walk me through code they’ve written. I’m super happy to reciprocate for 15 min and I think the candidate (if they’re working with me directly) would get a lot out of it.ants_everywhere 4 minutes ago

I resonate highly with this. Especially when brainstorming ideas with my manager. He's very quick with suggestions, and I am always saying ehhh I don't know let me think about it. I have realized that him giving me ideas quickly to iterate on is beneficial because I am always able to refine it.
I still do think it is a deficiency in some sense as I would have loved to be one of those guys who could just grok stuff instantly and contribute quickerDougN7 5 minutes ago
