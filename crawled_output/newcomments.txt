on: RIP pthread_cancel
I feel like the entire pthread_cancel and cancellation point feature is only really useful when your application is exiting and resource management doesn't matter anymore. If you want to use it on a long running process, the thread that gets canceled must effectively be completely free of any resource allocation....Unless of course you're making use of shared memory between processes, then you could still leak even when the entire process is shut down.divialex 0 minutes ago

Holy shit! This is an incredible piece of work.And they are almost all drawn “manually”! I am SO impressed by the dedication> For the last 10 years I have been able to draw around 2,547 stations> A pen, a notebook, a bit of spatial vision and the willingness to navigate all the staircases, corridors, platforms and mezzanines are enough to draw a station> Due to the boredom provoked by the COVID-19 lockdown in 2020, I decided to digitalize all the sketches I had drawn in since the early 2010sxyzzy123 1 minute ago

Parser combinators are very slow in languages without a sufficiently optimising compiler, I wouldn't recommend them here.In Gleam pattern matching and the "splitter" package is the go-to for text parsing.zemvpferreira 3 minutes ago

on: Perceived Age (2024)
Counterpoint: I've been semi-retired for almost 10 years. No money pressure. I spend most of my days on light hobbies and a few hours of work on a hobby business. I still feel like the years are going extremely quickly.I think our brains are addicted to novelty, and memory formation / time perception is intrinsically linked to variety. Personally I have a very nice life close to family and a good daily routine, I have little desire to change how I live. But I still recognise I'm missing out on perception of time past. I'll probably move my work hours up and take on more responsibility just to solve this problem. It's that or have a kid.krrishd 3 minutes ago

on: Why you’d issue a branded stablecoin
I see, I misread: that’s interesting. I would assume the issuer would still be liable to resolve the backing, but yeah I could see how that poses systemic risk.I also don’t think such a risk could realistically remain hidden - this is still going to be heavily regulated and audited, and industry will wise up to the sorts of risk that emerge.bitwize 3 minutes ago

> we would have been better off had Wayland just been a X11 extension.That would have never happened. From a functionality standpoint, Wayland is "the parts of X11 modern toolkits actually use".
Give clients a buffer, have them locally render into that buffer, then composite the buffers together into a final display. Xorg can do all this. It's just a question of, do we want the maintenance burden of all the other stuff that Xorg has, like obsolete graphics primitives, obsolete visuals, etc.? And do we want the architectural decisions of X11, which seemed sensible in the 80s, but make far less sense in light of modern GPUs and modern applications with modern display needs?The point of Wayland always was to start from scratch.somenameforme 4 minutes ago

So would your opinions be inciting violence by your own definitions? You mentioned above wanting to send weapons to Ukraine. Those weapons will be used to kill people, and have frequently been used to intentionally target victims with no military connection whatsoever. They will also be used to prolong a conflict that's not only increasingly obviously hopeless, but at this only being sustained exclusively by locking people inside of a country, making it impossible for them to leave, and then replenishing mass deaths on the front line by dragging random people in off the streets, often through violence.The overwhelming majority of Ukrainians want the war to end immediately by settlement, which obviously will include large scale territorial concessions. [1] The headline for that article is "Ukrainian support for war effort collapses", while you're here claiming we should perpetuate the war as much as possible, implicitly suggesting you're taking the Ukrainian side. This, by the way, is way free and open debate is so important. You obviously have not really thought to imagine how things might look from somebody else's perspective because you probably simply have not been exposed to that much, if at all.And it seems it's literally dangerous to expose certain groups contrary view points at this time in society, as they respond to words with bullets.[1] - https://news.gallup.com/poll/693203/ukrainian-support-war-ef...lemonberry 4 minutes ago

on: Will AI be the basis of many future industrial for...
I can see AI helping some businesses do really well. I can also see it becoming akin to mass manufacturing. Take furniture for example, there's a lot of mass produced furniture of varying quality. But there are still people out there making furniture by hand. A lot of the hand built furniture is commanding higher prices due to the time and skill required. And people buy it!I think we'll see a ton of games produced by AI or aided heavily by AI but there will still be people "hand crafting" games: the story, the graphics, etc. A subset of these games will have mass appeal and do well. Others will have smaller groups of fans.It's been some time since I've read it, but these conversation remind me of Walter Benjamin's essay, "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction".ImHereToVote 4 minutes ago

Apparently a lot of money is flowing into AI.Looking around, can find curious things current AI can't do but likely can find important things it can do.
Uh, there's "a lot of money", can't be sure
AI won't make big progress, and even on a national scale no one wants to fall behind. Looking around, it's scary about the growth -- Page and Brin in a garage, Bezos in a garage, Zuckerberg in school and "Hot or Not", Huang and graphics cards, ....
One or two guys, ... and in a few years change the world and $trillions in company value???
Smoking funny stuff?Yes, AI can be better than a library card catalog subject index and/or a dictionary/encyclopedia.
But a step or two forward and, remembering 100s of soldiers going "over the top" in WWI, asking why some AI robots won't be able to do the same?Within 10 years, what work can we be sure AI won't be able to do?So people will keep trying with ASML, TSMC, AMD, Intel, etc. -- for a yacht bigger than the one Bezos got or for national security, etc.While waiting for AI to do everything, starting now it can do SOME things and is improving.Hmm, a SciFi movie about Junior fooling around with electronics in the basement, first doing his little sister Mary's 4th grade homework, then in the 10th grade a published Web site book on the rise and fall of the Eastern Empire, Valedictorian, new frontiers in mRNA vaccines, ...?And what do people want?
How 'bout food, clothing, shelter, transportation, health, accomplishment, belonging, security, love, home, family?
So, with a capable robot (funded by a16z?), it builds two more like itself, each of those ..., and presto-bingo everyone gets what they want?"Robby, does P = NP?""Is Schrödinger's equation correct?""How and when can we travel faster than the speed of light?""Where is everybody?"rwyinuse 5 minutes ago

I guess I just don't feel like it's really my self-expression, if I just told a generative AI model to create it. I do sometimes create AI art, but I rarely feel like it's worth keeping, since I didn't really put any effort into creating it. There's no emotional connection to the output. In fact I have a wall display which shows a changing painting generated by stable diffusion, but the fun in that is mainly the novelty, not knowing what will be there next time.Still, I do think you're probably right. Most new music one hears in the radio isn't that great. If you can just create fresh songs of your own liking for every day, then that could be a real threat to that kind of music. But I highly doubt people will stop listening to the great hits of Queen, Bob Marley etc because you can generate similar music with AI.balamatom 5 minutes ago

Nice bloody try, guv, I mean "blitz_skull".Tell me now will ya, who will effect "the real weight of social consequence" over anonymous 1-to-1M connections, other than other humans, the same kind that by your premise are not "capable of responsibly wielding [...] power" over such things?(Or are there multiple kinds? Eh?)Would "the real weight of social consequence" work the way you want it to when embodied by a commission? When codified by law? In the form a bot? As crowd? A corp? Me? Nah, you of course.It's ever telling how the legitimacy of millions of strangers being able to decide the fate of any one individual is hardly ever called into question - only ever the ability of one to talk back.namdnay 6 minutes ago

People wank about "stability and convertibility" for reserve currency, but the real story is USD strong because USD profitable. US can internationalize domestic crisis, blow up countries, stir foreign instability "paradoxically" global investors pile into the dollar safe haven. The foundation of that is investors trust FED will ensure USD more profitable on stabilized basis than alternatives, regardless of problems, foreign or domestic, and overtime this accumulates into uncontestably deep liquidity that sustains reserve currency. But that's also mechanism of baseline Triffin bind: the U.S. runs deficits to supply dollars abroad to maintain reserve status, if Trump (because that's what he's signalling) deliberately abandons USD ROI credibility and sustains it, like weak-dollar policy (for muh exports, how how investors lose 30c on the dollar), reserve demand unravels or debt servicing increases even more. AKA USD can survive almost any external crises, but internal sabotage i.e. sustained deliberate devaluation will erode profitability (safety) / liquidity premium -> feedback loop of weaker demand, higher yields, both bad. Reserve demand only works when the FED isn't captured for policy that undermines USD premium / mercantilist FX gaming and US eats Triffin that may or may not be good for Americans.At end of the day PRC doesn't want RMB as reserve, they don't want Triffin either. They just want insulation from USD weaponization while the U.S. is sanction-happy and forced into erratic policy trying to "solve" its structural bind by making foreigners eat the cost. The real Chinese play is to build RMB strength at home while the U.S. either burns the dollar to dig out of the debt hole, imposing losses on global investors, or keeps digging until debt service alone paralyzes U.S. policy capacity, already visible in constraints on defense procurement, i.e. airforce / naval capitalization. That paralysis is the bigger strategic win than simply ending USD reserve status.rickydroll 8 minutes ago

Interesting perspective on meditation. I was fortunate enough to have had good teachers through the Cambridge Insight Meditation Center and the Insight Meditation Society. As you would expect, my experience differs from what you described.In my opinion, breath-focused meditation is not thinking. It is being aware of the physical sensations of breathing and being aware of emotions and thoughts that arrive, but not engaging with them. Breath awareness and letting thoughts and emotions come into your mind is the easy part. Not engaging with them is the tricky part.You are right to point out that suggestions like meditation are not one-size-fits-all. Some people aren't ready to commit to the changes meditation brings about, just as others are not ready to undertake weight loss or personal improvement. No blame. When you're ready, the practice will be there.RE: Running on autopilot. Yes, there are parts of the body that need to function on autopilot, such as breathing and heartbeat. I appreciate that my stomach and intestines run on autopilot. At the same time, I think running on autopilot is dangerous because that is what gets hijacked by social media and misled by advertising. It's why you miss a turn and drive the way you always drove and why you write down the wrong date when the year changes. I consider running an automatic as a possible reason why using AI "makes people stupider."Meditation (walking, breath, flame) taps into a semi-universal part of the brain, below the level of consciousness, and provides a mechanism for reducing brain chaos, also known as the monkey mind. In my experience, developing the skill of reducing monkey mind-generated chaos becomes a semi-automatic process reinforced through daily meditation practice.Most mindfulness practices focus on being aware of your body and mind at a low level all the time. It's not an active engagement; it's simply being aware. The monkey mind burns a lot of cycles, and I would rather spend those cycles being aware of the monkey mind triggers and not engaging with them.tomatocracy 9 minutes ago

I think you've missed a big part of maths - yes knowing those things is necessary. But then you also need to be able to see how a difficult or complex problem could be restated or broken down in a different way which lets you use those techniques. Sometimes this is something as trivial as using the right notation or coordinates, sometimes it's much more involved.vips7L 9 minutes ago

I disagree with your conclusion, but my argument is rather about why a strong censorship and surveillance apparatus exists in UK and PRC and why USA merely has mass surveillance apparatus without concomitant mass censorship. Another feature of American memetic ecosystem is some immunization against manipulation, in that memes such as “Russia is manipulating elections” or “university professors are indoctrinating students” are widespread if not universal. You will note that in nature the most effective rate of immunity in a population is never 100%.I am a humble HN poster, and this is simply food for thought, and I appreciate your attention.ankitnayan 10 minutes ago

You’re strengthening OP’s point instead of undermining it.The “some governments banned it for kids” argument is an appeal to authority, a logical fallacy.The actions of tech-reactionist leftist governments absolutely do not constitute sound science or evidence in this matter.And if you’re claiming the French government only makes government policy based on sound data, I will point you to their currently unraveling government over the mathematically impossible social pension scheme they’ve created.undebuggable 12 minutes ago

Their point is that if the money held in reserve are proceeds from criminal activity, it is possible for the assets to be seized or frozen by the feds (which would render them no longer backed 1-to-1 even if they were before then). The text of the law you quoted doesn't really change anything.More
