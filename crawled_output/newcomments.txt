on: EU court rules nuclear energy is clean energy
> The money Germany "wasted" on renewables brought down prices a lot,It massively increased the price of electricity in Germany.
And the same holds true of pretty much every other location that tried it.And it did remarkably little for CO₂ emissions, massively increased our dependence on cheap Russian Gas thus emboldening Putin, cemented our fossil fuel dependence for reliable base load, entrenched our dependence on China.On the whole, "wasted" is putting it kindly.Yes, the prices of the generating equipment have come down from truly astronomical to only "not competitive without massive subsidies".Had we spend the same money on nuclear power plants, we would have long been done with the decarbonization of our electricity sector, and probably well into the electrification and ensuing decarbonization of the other sectors as well.Except we would have found it difficult to spend that much on nuclear power plants, because even at the price of the messed up EPR prototypes, the same money would have bought us over 50 reactors.
At the price of the first three Konvois, around 100, adjusted for inflation and some increases.
But when you build 50-100 reactors of the same kind (that's important: don't make every new one different like we used to do), the cost does go down.France is increasing its fission fleet again, after repealing a law that made such expansion illegal beyond the then existing generating capacity 63.2 GW.The goal of a reduction of the nuclear share to below 50% was also repealed.
I do believe that the share of nuclear in France will decrease somewhat, because intermittent renewables can let the nuclear plants run at higher efficiencies by taking up some of the variability that is currently handled by the nuclear plants.lostlogin 1 minute ago

I was literally experimenting with this today.Use Google Nano Banana to generate your sprite with a magenta background, then ask it to generate the final frame of the animation you want to create.Then use Google Flow to create an animation between the two frames with Veo3Its astoundingly effective, but still rather laborious and lacking in ergonomics. For example the video aspect ratio has to be fixed, and you need to manually fill the correct shade of magenta for transparency keying since the imagen model does not do this perfectly.If I was not super busy with family and work, I'd build a wrapper around these toolsMattJ100 2 minutes ago

on: UTF-8 is a brilliant design
For example, modern Python internally uses three forms (Latin-1, UTF-16 and 32) depending on the contents of the string. But this can be done for all encodings and also for things like file names that do not follow Unicode. The Unicode standard does not dictate everything must take the same form; it can be used to keep existing forms but make them compatible.rdm_blackhole 4 minutes ago

on: China is ditching the dollar, fast: Officials beli...
People trust powerful states who might occasional do shitty things because they tend to assert their dominance when necessary.You can see that clearly now with how the EU completely messed up their negotiations with Trump regarding the tariffs.If you are an investor and you are given the chance to invest in two companies, one of them located in a country that is not afraid of throwing it's weight around to get things done or defend it's interests and the other who might have a better record in terms of human rights but doesn't want to appear too aggressive, which one do you pick?If the only thing you care about is ROI then the answer is easy. Is it right? Probably not but that is just the world we live in and the system that we are all part of.Obviously this is a simplified example but you get the gist.Personally I think that the problem with the USD is that it can be used as a weapon against other countries. Why would China risk being cut off from the global banking system like Russia was? It simply makes no sense.Cutting Russia from SWIFT was major mistake.It only reinforced what China and other countries already knew, that is, that it can be weaponized in an instant. That in turns means that we should see a decrease in the USD dominance and a shift away from the traditional big players like SWIFT in favor of other home grown systems like CIPS.sandworm101 4 minutes ago

on: SkiftOS: A hobby OS built from scratch using C/C++...
Sure it can all be solved, FUSE is an example of doing that for less important ancillary filesystems. I'd actually just make the protocol stateless and store fd state in the clients. My point is more general - the people who design operating systems know all about these tradeoffs and have to decide what to spend time on within a limited budget.Consider: crash bugs are finite. Do you spend your time on complex rearchitecting of your OS to try and fail slightly less hard when some critical code crashes, or do you spend that time fixing the bugs? If the code is big, fast changing and third party then it might make sense to put in the effort, hence FUSE and why graphics drivers often run a big chunk of code out of kernel. If the code is small, stable and performance sensitive, like a core filesystem where all your executables reside, then it doesn't make sense and stays in.Browsers also use a micro-kernelish concept these days. But they're very deliberate and measured about what gets split out into extra processes and what doesn't.The microkernel concept advocates for ignoring engineering tradeoffs in order to put everything into userspace all the time, and says precious little about how to ensure that translates into actual rewards. That's why it's an academic concept that's hardly used today.jddj 7 minutes ago

on: Why you’d issue a branded stablecoin
I think there is plenty of counter-evidence in how this is being approached:- The obvious: these are stablecoins, whose value is pegged to and 1:1 backed by fiat currency / is not capable of the cliche pump&dump dynamics of other crypto tokens.- To the extent that (eg. today) they are coupled to a network like ETH or Solana (whose holders stand to gain) - both Stripe and Circle are building L1 blockchains right now whose native gas tokens are stablecoins, and are therefore also decoupled from any of the bagholder stuff. Merits of those chains aside: the big players want to further eliminate that dynamic and are putting their money where their mouth is.- Stripe (and other legitimate fintechs) want to use stablecoins specifically because they legitimately make cross-border payments much easier, and because there is serious/earnest usage emerging. SWIFT actually does suck (not just to the cliche engineer-who-wants-better-APIs way, but even a banking professional would tell you), international payments are more unsolved than you think outside of a few fintechs who are basically just managing massive ledgers + a ton of liquidity around the world.(In short: I think your take is something that may have made more sense 5-10 years ago, when Stripe themselves ditched crypto for the reasons that it didn't work for anything useful and was primarily a means of gambling)tomhow 7 minutes ago

on: The value of bringing a telephoto lens
Interestingly, it was what pushed me back into it. Even just capturing family stuff, the limitations of smartphone cameras were always niggling, the article gives one example of why, but focal length is just one of the things you gain more control over with a real camera.I realised a big reason I defaulted to my phone was simply that it's always there in my pocket, while my "real" camera was a burden to carry around. Related to the popular photography maxim that "the best camera is the one you have with you".One day, after "seeing" some good shots in my head and totally missing them due to phone camera limitations, I decided I had to fix it. I started with an RX100 (I got the M3 secondhand at a decent price), which is as pocketable as a phone and immediately improved things for me.Eventully that reminded me how much I enjoyed real photography, and now I often cart a big camera and multiple lenses around with me again. Oh well :)tsimionescu 8 minutes ago

on: Legal win
Trademark law exists to protect consumers from counterfeit goods. Basically, it exists to allow consumers to recognize the goods of someone they have established trust with. If I know I like Coca Cola, I can just buy any bottle that has the Coca Cola trademark and know what I'm getting, instead of worrying I'll get a completely different beverage.This gets more complicated when multiple companies are selling services for the same open source software, because you want all of them to be able to say what their services are for, but you don't want one of them to tarnish the reputation of the software itself. But as long as all the companies are actually selling services for the same software, like in the case of WPEngine and the other company here, consumers are better served and informed if both call it WordPress.0xDEAFBEAD 8 minutes ago

Best of luck to you.I worked with Japanese and Germans in the field, so I guess you don't know what you're talking about and are projecting your biases.

The apparatus we call GFW is really a Chinese CDC for memes. The CDC expects novel strains of bird flu every year, it’s okay, they closely monitor the situation, research the novel strains, cull risky populations, and develop vaccines for worst case scenarios. GFW expects novel strains of anti-CCP viral memes every year, it’s okay, they closely monitor the situation, they analyze the meme for spreaders and origin, they use the new meme to gauge changes in public sentiment, they fine or jail or imprison particularly quarrelsome netizens, and in the worst case scenario they prepare narrative shifts or outright censorship to maintain a net that is deemed healthy. It’s meme epidemiology, with mind viruses instead of RNA viruses.burnt-resistor 11 minutes ago

on: Debian 13, Postgres, and the US/* time zones
In many systems it is reasonable not to include a zone. Usually that goes hand-in-hand with the desire to use a more compact representation, such as storing a numerical timestamp with a customary interpretation (usually UTC or TAI). If you must store a string, you may as well include a zone. Using ambiguously-zoned timestamps is an invitation for bugs. I feel your pain.jbs789 12 minutes ago
