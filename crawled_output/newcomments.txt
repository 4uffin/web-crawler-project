Higher UV…Theoretically solar cells designed for more more UV intensity could produce quite a lot more electricity.I imagine solar panels for space craft are designed with this in mind.Of course the economics of this, that there’s only a few places where this is useful wouldn’t justify it all.tombert 0 minutes ago

I don't like him anymore because I think he's a perverted creep, but in the streaming space Destiny was reasonably good at this. I haven't watched him in years, but I remember reading about a few people that he managed to talk out of the more radical conservatism.Insanity 0 minutes ago

In EU we by and large don’t eat what America produces though. The same products like Doritos etc will have different ingredients in EU compared to US.US typically gets the cheaper and worse option (less safe). Same for American coke w/ Cane Sugar instead of actual sugar.Americans will regularly consume chemicals that are potentially carcinogenic and banned in EU.framel 0 minutes ago

Drop counterproductive and unpopular Culture War issues and instead fight about very stupid ideas pushed by Trump et all.Part of problem is that the most unproductive and unpopular and poor ideas are the most loved ones among their elites.DaveZale 0 minutes ago

on: Get Out of Technology
I was just about to post the same question.I thought the problem was billions of social media users giving it all away for free to the big platforms.What else is left to give?
They already give away content, privacy including location data and social circles, possibly even the film roll on their phones.. what else is there to give away?greenie_beans 1 minute ago

i mean the right literally voted for epsteins BFF and also the most prominent partner in child trafficking. Hiring minor under pretense of internship, drugging/spiking then and then trafficking them to private island. The difference between right and left is like night and day.in case someone's feeling got hurt. Throughout the history of world not USA, right ideology has also blindly supported deregulation that people will die but regulation will naturally take place( ? ) like free markertdavidw 1 minute ago

I think in this case you're actually advocating for "the devil" - that man is not using his money or voice for a better society, to put it mildly.I mean just a few days ago, we got "the left is the party of murder" - super helpful in terms of turning down the heat in the US. And of course that was without knowing what we now know about that situation...randomNumber7 1 minute ago

Energy is so cheap it's not really worth the effort (economically).And if it would be more expensive stuff like cooking or washing clothes would still hurt more than downloading a file with a big PC.Minor49er 1 minute ago

on: Two Slice, a font that's only 2px tall
You're right. The capitals look fine, but the lowercased versions look swapped. I think this is because the creator decided to cut the spines for the uppercases and crop out the arms for lowercases. Since the arms and spine point in opposite directions for "s" and "z", it really hurts their identificationbitlax 1 minute ago

I get two types of merge requests nowadays. The first is a traditional piece of code. Something simple like a bit of marketing text to a page or a new react component that adds another drop down menu somewhere. The second type is a long complex merge request, for something more complex than a menu (not really though)…tabs, uses new dependencies, none of the old dependencies, is filled with emdashed code comments about personal dev choices (instead of logic flow or business context), and the core file convention is named after the implementers library choice: `react-tabs`. If I bring up any of these issues with the implementer they tell me “we can fix it later and they need to just get it out”.The first type of merge request is one that should be generated by an LLM and the second is one that should be generated by a human.Instead I get neither but I get efficiency so someone can deliver at the last minute. And so I can can go mop up the work later or my job is hell, the next time “we just need to get this out the door”.THANK YOU LLMSrapawel 2 minutes ago

There are occasional false positives, but querying different Cloudflare data centers usually resolves this. I've found that switching VPN servers (which routes through different CF edge locations) eventually gives the correct result.tombert 2 minutes ago

Being critical of the news is good, but I don't think we want the lefty equivalent of the "Do Your Own Research" conspiracy crowd.The problem with undermining trust in the news media is that people will just replace that with blind trust with something else, and we have no way of really knowing if that something else will be worse.
This is what happened with conservatives and led to the rise of Infowars.Atlas667 3 minutes ago

The lack of images made Gemini unworkable for me. I know it's by design, but illustrations are an important part of my writing.It's more sensible to build the sort of websites I want to see, and to use Reader Mode for other people's websites.sindriava 3 minutes ago

It's also important to note that one party wants to drill while also greatly increasing development of renewables so we can reduce the need for future drilling, increase regulatory limits on emissions over time, provide incentives to adopt more energy efficient appliances, and recognizes that the world needs to reach net zero sometime in the next few decades and is trying to reach that gradually.The other party wants to drill while doing everything it can to discourage renewables, is eliminating as many limits on emissions as it can and stopping enforcement of those it cannot yet eliminate, and their views on addressing global warming are a superposition of {it is a hoax by the Chinese to harm the US, it may be happening but humans have no way to influence it, it is good, even if global warming is as bad as predicted and we get a few degrees rise it is no problem because we can increase fossil fuels enough to make cheap air conditioning available so we can get by fine just like Dubai gets by fine with an average temperature of 35F higher than that [1]}. They also want to eliminate funding for satellites that monitor the climate and eliminate emissions reporting requirements for the industries that do most of the emitting.[1] https://www.heritage.org/environment/commentary/how-fossil-f...michaelterryio 3 minutes ago

The human brain can not handle social media. It has melted our brains and completely controls the Main Signal with its algorithms. The right is better at controlling the media in such a system, and is ascendant. We live in meme world now. Nothing is serious. It's all just memes.DrewADesign 3 minutes ago

Do you consider designers part of “we” or is it only the computer people that count?It’s definitely not better for the general public. Designers can’t even be replaced by AI as effectively as authors. They make things sorta ’look designed’ to people that don’t understand design, but have none of the communication and usability benefits that make designers useful. The result is slicker-looking, but probably less usable than if it was cobbled together with default bootstrap widgets, which is how it would have been done 2+ years ago. If an app needs a designer enough to not be feasible without one, AI isn’t going to replace the designer in that process. It just makes the author feel cool.soared 4 minutes ago

Dismantling the us in its current state would be a massive opportunity to gain more power/wealth/control/etc.Risk reward is dead simple. You’re already rich and powerful, you fail and become slightly less rich
and powerful. You succeed and have absolute control over the most powerful country in the worlddeadbabe 4 minutes ago
