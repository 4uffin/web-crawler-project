on: Java 25's new CPU-Time Profiler
There's always legacy systems; it's part of the natural lifecycle of software. Also, what you buy is any kind of support, regardless of the version you're on. Support doesn't mean access to patches but an SLA for the tickets you file.s20n 1 minute ago

on: Recreating the US/* time zone situation
This is a false analogy. Currencies are volatile whereas timezones are static and rule based.Converting timestamps between time zones is perfectly reversible while there is a loss of information when you convert a value to a new currency.FirmwareBurner 1 minute ago

It's not my imagination. It's my experience with benchmarking it.
The implementation I linked to is 2x (or even more on relatively short arrays) faster than standard library C++ sort. Is Rust sort as fast?mezod 2 minutes ago

on: SpikingBrain 7B – More efficient than classic LLMs
To me it sounds like sparse matrix multiplication repackaged as "event-driven spiking computation", where the spikes are simply the non-zero elements that sparse GPU kernels have always been designed to process.The supposedly dynamic/temporal nature of the model seems to be not applied for GPU execution, collapsing it into a single static computation equivalent to just applying a pre-calculated sparsity mask.Perhaps a bit cynical of me, but it feels like wrapping standard sparse computing and operator fusion in complex, biological jargon...spankibalt 3 minutes ago

on: Models of European Metro Stations
In London that’s also mostly true due to the patchwork history of different companies building different lines… however when King’s Cross/St Pancras was redeveloped a few years ago the “official” interchange route between Piccadilly and Victoria lines became much, much longer - minutes of walking compared to seconds. This site doesn’t cover that station, but does link to TfL’s own diagrams via IanVisits, and the reason is clear: at one end the platforms of both lines are almost touching - and I believe that shortcut staircase is still there if you ignore the signs and know where to find it - but the tourist friendly route is much more circuitous, going up to the mainline station and back again. I assume it helps to relieve congestion in an extremely busy station, I remember more than one occasion when they just have to close entry to the platforms during rush hour due to overcrowding.19h 5 minutes ago

on: ChatGPT Sent Me to the ER
Anecdotal evidence:I am currently in the hospital for a lung disease with a near perfect blood screen, only slightly impaired lung capacity parameters -- walking 30 meters made me feel like I'm suffocating. There were almost 12 pneumologists, thorax surgeons, and other related doctors, involved; when they ran out of options I wrote a program that processed the CT DICOM images and produced a 3d image of the lungs where the inflamed tissue is highlighted [0]. I requested all blood test results, biolab sample results extracted via branchoscopy, digitalised them, provided a clear timeline of symptoms, blood tests and results, and the medical imaging at each specific point in time. GPT5 Pro the proceeded to analyze the data, imagery (which it ... understood the first time it saw them), test results, and provided its interpretation [1].Granted, everyone in my family is working as a doctor, so I have background to know what to look for, but with the review by GPT5 Pro we were able to identify the correct lung condition, treat it and I am able to breathe normally again, I was even able to jog all around the hospital today![0] https://imgur.com/a/7mhcLBD[1] https://imgur.com/a/Zs8PdMPfwiw, I use this "trait" customization / system prompt for ChatGPT: https://gist.github.com/19h/648db3765d8af986e8ccaebd530493b8.michaelt 5 minutes ago

When it comes to fan art of Disney characters, the legal position is "Disney could sue you for that, but chooses not to as suing fans would be bad PR, don't do anything commercial with it though or they'll sue you for sure"So - yes, as I understand things it can indeed be illegal even if a human does the learning.HPsquared 5 minutes ago

I don't see the logic in this argument. What's the difference from your argument if I state that murder is a characteristic of our humanity? If people are to be allowed to be fully expressive as humans they need to be able to murder.IshKebab 6 minutes ago

I do value self expression, that’s why I play multiple instruments, paint, draw, sculpt. I fail to see how prompting a machine to make music for you is self expression, even if it’s to your exact specifications.QuantumNomad_ 7 minutes ago

Most beat it, e. g. the aesthetically much superior UI of the Canon Cat, which one can admire on the same website. Aside from that, many SGI computer cases look tacky, sort of like the N64 of the computer world; they remind me a bit of Colani's case designs. Well, at least the guts were/are impressive.dustingetz 8 minutes ago

on: Visual programming is stuck on the form
i think you’re looking for the term “computational structure”, as in, “what is the computational structure of a user interface” i.e. what typeclasses does the computation reify. To avoid impedance mismatches the authoring notation must align exactly to and emerge from the underlying computational structure. So as a starting point: modern applications have a frontend and a backend, they are reactive, async, and concurrent, they perform network IO and manage resources. Or at least they have components that do, which means the computational structure as a whole must encode these capabilities. if the computational structure is not uniform, i.e. the frontend and backend are treated separately, or the database is relational but the backend-for-frontend needs dynamic graph walking, then you will have seams between modules and arbitrary glue code cruft will accumulate and this will violate the alignment between authoring notation and underlying structure. Now your ORM needs XML configs to inject additional knowledge about the data access patterns that can’t be reflected from the notation.franze 8 minutes ago
