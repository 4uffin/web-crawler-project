on: Models of European Metro Stations
Love this project. Back in my transit blogging days, one of the themes was short and long transfers. And here this idea immediately starts surfacing just looking at the stations - the crazy mazes with long tunnels are cool to explore on paper, but suck for actual transfers. It adds slogs in the middle of the trips, and kind of discourages transit use because trips seem longer and more work.When scrolling down, the author actually includes a long discussion on the best possible transfer layouts! Many of the terrible stations over time are of course historically grown, evolved over time, and weren't the result of some maniac evil genius deciding to create miserable transfers. Systems are built sometimes over a hundred years, so a later station is added mostly where it can fit, not a as a result of some master plan.But there's also ways to deal with these issues, which can be found in Berlin.1) for opened "Unter den linden" station, a transfer between a new extension (u5) and a 100-year-old line (u6), a station on the old line was actually moved by 180m so that the transfer would be good. (That is, the old station was closed a a new station built a bit a distance away)2) in Berlin, especially after WWII, a lot of the subway construction followed a very long term master plan (to the extend that West Berlin actually planned a network for all of Berlin, even though the East was in another country behind the iron curtain). When stations were built, the planners "knew" it would be a transfer some day, so they added in accomodations ("Bauvorleistung" or preparations ahead of actual construciton), often whole station shells for the future line it would connect to. This resulted in a lot of short transfers even when lines were built decades apart. And it also resulted in a bunch of ghost stations, which have yet to be connected to lines.somenameforme 0 minutes ago

The point of debate is not to change the other person's mind. That's very rarely going to happen, and even less commonly immediately. The point of debate is to provide context and information that somebody may not have been aware of. The reason for this is that the views we decide to adopt are not entirely conscious. They're driven by a large number of issues that coalesce on a subconscious level, but that takes time to change.For instance people trend more conservative as they age, but there's no real simple point where you wake up one day and like 'ok, I now officially love guns, babies, and 'Merica.' It's a very gradual process that's driven by things like life experience and the accumulation of knowledge, all processed on a subconscious level. As you age you'll find that you often will think the 'you' of 10 years ago was a naive idiot, and this never really seems to stop. Yet if the 'you' of 10 years from now talked to you today, it's unlikely he could change your mind on a single thing, even though he is literally you.oleksandr_l5 0 minutes ago

on: Life, work, death and the peasant: Rent and extrac...
Its tricky, though. There might be people who are doing a perfectly good job and kicking them arbitrarily might be suboptimal.Then there is room for quite a lot of direct or indirect corruption. e.g. if you know you won't have a job in 4-8 years major corporations and other organizations offering you a cushy job if you do the "right things" might become quite a bit more appealing.But yes, having a distinct class of career politicians has some significant downsides as well..> The opposite is requiring people to ascend through the ranks (perhaps starting as low as a mayor of a town)Might work fine or there might be a lot of gatekeeping if you just want to get on the first step since that will likely be controlled quite tightly by the established parties/cliques.dan-robertson 2 minutes ago

on: Microsoft is officially sending employees back to ...
Not having access to land you had a right to farm (and therefore needing to be a tenant farmer of some kind or – even worse – a wage labourer) was pretty bad for a peasant. It was also hard/impossible to escape from on the back of one’s labour. It is in this sense that land (or associated rights) was worth significantly more than one could make through labour.DiabloD3 3 minutes ago

on: I don't like curved displays
Optimal viewing distance for most media (including text found in programs and websites made in the "Vista" and "Retina OSX" era to today, but also all movies and TV shows cut for modern 16:9 displays) is between 30 (SMPTE rec.) and 40 (THX rec.) degrees.THX's recommendation is based purely on the viewing angle of the fovae (the inner part of the retina that is "high res"), and trying to optimize full coverage of it (ie, pixels on the screen should not fall outside of the fovae).Microsoft, during Vista, and Apple, during the evolution of OSX, both standardized font sizes as a little larger to make all text sizes comfortable at the 30 to 40 degree range. 30 degrees is * 1.6 diagonal size, 40 degrees is * 1.2 diagonal size.So, if you have a standard 24" 1080p monitor, that is 28.8 to 38.4 inches, not 20.SMPTE and THX did not change recommendations for 4k, as the view angle of visual media (ie, the focal length in movies/TV shows) did not change, and text doubles in (pixel) size (but not apparent size) to accommodate it; ergo, do math as if you're on a 100% DPI display. Ergo, 24" 4k would be the same.Also, for completeness sake, 27" 1440p are rare, but a bit more common with gamers, and their math works out to be between 32.4 and 43.2 inches. This is assuming you adjusted your DPI to 133% and/or you're purely focused on movies/TV and games; if you consume only text and stay at 100% and never view media, you may wish 24.3 to 32.4 inches instead.d1sxeyes 3 minutes ago

There are plenty of layoffs and firings in European countries too. You must have been incredible lucky if have never witnessed it. Each country has different laws regarding employment and it varies a lot between them. Making this Europe vs USA is frankly weird.pjaoko 7 minutes ago

on: If my kids excel, will they move away?
If you can’t afford to live on 150k/year even in SF, that’s just poor financial planning…It’s not like McDonald’s or Target don’t exist in SF. Those workers get paid way less than big tech and somehow they make rent every month. Yea, you might have to commute instead living within walking distance of the campus where you work, but that’s just being a responsible adult imo.ahoka 7 minutes ago

on: Why you’d issue a branded stablecoin
Cross border payments with stable coin is way easier and faster than with USD. When crypto is in a bull cycle demand for stable coins raise as short term interest, sometimes up to 50%/year (for a few hours or a day). Stable coins generate yield for their operators, they won’t run with your money due to the same reasons why a bank CEO won’t.evrimoztamur 8 minutes ago

on: EU court rules nuclear energy is clean energy
Which means you need a return on the investment for it to work. Creating self sustaining industries that don’t need subsidies.Tossing an absolutely mindbogglingly large subsidy to the 70 year old nuclear industry which never has delivered competitive products is not a good use of money. It is like saying we create value by going around breaking windows and paying people to fix it.France’s problem is that if they don’t fix the spending issue on their own the bond market will do it for them. Maintaining the debt will be a larger and larger portion of the budget until the only option is solving the issue.Cutting spending will lower GDP and push up debt as a percent of GDP. But it wasn’t real income when the debt you took on did not lead to productive outcomes. Just polishing a pig.dottjt 10 minutes ago

on: Safe C++ proposal is not being continued
I can't rationalize how "prevents... except" isn't still just heuristics.r/cpp is full of people with such heuristics, ways that they personally have fewer safety bugs in their software. That's how C++ got its "core guidelines", and it is clearly the foundation of Herb's profiles. You can't get to safety this way, you can get closer than you were in a typical C++ codebase and for Geoff that was important.More
