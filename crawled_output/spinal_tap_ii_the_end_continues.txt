Forty-one years after the release of the groundbreaking mockumentary This Is Spinal Tap, the now estranged bandmates David St. Hubbins, Nigel Tufnel, and Derek Smalls (Michael McKean, Christopher Guest, and Harry Shearer) are forced to reunite for one final concert. Spinal Tap II: The End Continues also marks the resurrection of documentarian Marty Di Bergi (Rob Reiner), who once again tries to capture his favorite metal gods as they contemplate mortality--and the hope that their 12th drummer doesn't join them in The Great Beyond. Joined by music royalty Paul McCartney and Elton John, Spinal Tap wrestles with their checkered past to put on a concert that they hope will solidify their place in the pantheon of rock 'n' roll.

Spinal Tap II: The End Continues
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Getting the band back together for an encore, Spinal Tap II's dry sense of humor doesn't reach the heights of the original's comedic brilliance but still hits the right nostalgia chords while wisely acting its own age.

Little White Lies
At best, this is a late-period diversion that most fans will either ignore or try to forget, while at worst, it does reach the point where you feel as if it might be actively working against the band’s legacy.
Rated: 1/5

This collection of tired jokes is enough to prompt the question, “What day did the Lord create Spinal Tap II: The End Continues, and couldn’t he have rested on that day too?”
Rated: 2/5

Is Spinal Tap II funny? I’ll give you a qualified yes. The sensation of a new comic universe popping into being is absent, because you can do that only once, but the original elements are still vital.

“Spinal Tap: The End Continues” keeps the momentum going with a story that’s not trying to retread on the past, and isn’t interested in cheap nostalgia jokes by making a story for the band set in this time.

Film Feeder
Reiner and his bandmates rely too much on the classics to bring anything new to the stage, leaving it a low-energy encore that nobody asked for.

Denerstein Unleashed
Spinal Tap perfectly met its moment in 1984. The same can’t be said of this sequel...Still, the sequel offers enough laughs to justify its existence, even if it's a bit shocking to see the long-haired versions of this group as men in their 70s.

Not as good as the first one, but there’s still a lot of funny moments. Definitely worth seeing at least once.

Super funny and true to the energy of the original, with a loving amount of reverence for the time gone by. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing these rock gods back on stage and back on the screen.
