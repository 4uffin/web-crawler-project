Forty-one years after the release of the groundbreaking mockumentary This Is Spinal Tap, the now estranged bandmates David St. Hubbins, Nigel Tufnel, and Derek Smalls (Michael McKean, Christopher Guest, and Harry Shearer) are forced to reunite for one final concert. Spinal Tap II: The End Continues also marks the resurrection of documentarian Marty Di Bergi (Rob Reiner), who once again tries to capture his favorite metal gods as they contemplate mortality--and the hope that their 12th drummer doesn't join them in The Great Beyond. Joined by music royalty Paul McCartney and Elton John, Spinal Tap wrestles with their checkered past to put on a concert that they hope will solidify their place in the pantheon of rock 'n' roll.

Spinal Tap II: The End Continues
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Getting the band back together for an encore, Spinal Tap II's dry sense of humor doesn't reach the heights of the original's comedic brilliance but still hits the right nostalgia chords while wisely acting its own age.

At best, this is a late-period diversion that most fans will either ignore or try to forget, while at worst, it does reach the point where you feel as if it might be actively working against the band’s legacy.

This collection of tired jokes is enough to prompt the question, “What day did the Lord create Spinal Tap II: The End Continues, and couldn’t he have rested on that day too?”

Is Spinal Tap II funny? I’ll give you a qualified yes. The sensation of a new comic universe popping into being is absent, because you can do that only once, but the original elements are still vital.

“Spinal Tap: The End Continues” keeps the momentum going with a story that’s not trying to retread on the past, and isn’t interested in cheap nostalgia jokes by making a story for the band set in this time.

Reiner and his bandmates rely too much on the classics to bring anything new to the stage, leaving it a low-energy encore that nobody asked for.

Spinal Tap perfectly met its moment in 1984. The same can’t be said of this sequel...Still, the sequel offers enough laughs to justify its existence, even if it's a bit shocking to see the long-haired versions of this group as men in their 70s.

11/10 movie. Adorable plot, star studded cast that lives up to the 40 year hype. Excellent and stunning arrays of lighting and film squashed up into an hour and thirty minutes of heaven. Hits after hits after hits. Every guest star that appears you think no way, every new scene is a laugh. My stomach still hurts. I love Spinal Tap and Spinal Tap 2.

As a massive fan of the original film I was cautiously optimistic but entered Spinal Tap 2: The End Continues with relatively low expectations since some old beloved films have recently had terrible sequels in recent years, such as Anchorman and the Texas Chainsaw Massacre requel. Oh man did this movie exceed my expectations! McKean, Guest, Shearer, and Reiner still have their comedic improv charm that made the first film really hilarious. First and foremost they are the center of the story and it’s a hilarious tale, but to address the rock royalty guest list they are all in reverence of these guys and do a really great job adding to the comedy of each scene. And may I say I really do love their music. It’s funny and technically well made for rock standards. Elton John was powerful in his rendition of Stonehenge. Spinal Tap has not so quietly become their own rock institution. Many have followed in their footsteps, like the mighty Tenacious D. The banter in this movie is amazing, it’s a fun ride. I highly recommend seeing this if you’re a fan of the first film, it is faithful in style and tone.

I remember seeing the original This Is Spinal Tap as a midnight movie in college. This is a great sequel, lots of familiar faces and surprising guest appearances. The tone is right on target with absurd humor and consistent logical storytelling. The music is great and the Stonehenge sequence is a wonderful reference to the original film. My friend hasn’t seen the original movie but he really enjoyed this one and looks forward to seeing how it started.
