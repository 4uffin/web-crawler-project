I know of a Thai person who fell for an "e-work" scam over the last year.The hook was that you pre-pay some amount, do some trival work, then get like 500% return on your "investment".
So they filter+train their mark by having them sign up for whatever financial transfer workflow, and figure out how gullable they are by giving them some payouts.
A big part of this is some chat-group where lots of other fake-workers post comments saying how nervious/risky it seems and how sometimes the payment is delayed but they all eventually get paid.
Eventually they let the mark sign up for some high-value amount, like equivalent of a few thousand USD.
When the mark doesn't get paid, they contact the "technical support" team that then tries to social engineer the victim to loose even more money transferring funds the wrong direction (the scammers picked financial apps that make this mistake easiest).I kind of find it unbelievable that people fall for this stuff, but the obvious proof is that enough people do :(replythephyber 2 hours ago

> I kind of find it unbelievable that people fall for this stuffI remember reading a headline that being poor is equivalent to losing about 5 IQ points. Don’t know how true that is, but my intuition tells me that most people financially struggle, spend a lot of extra time worrying about money, and in general act a little more desperate and would be a little more aware/skeptical if their stress + financial situation allowed it.After a few years working in cybersecurity, I viewed EVERYTHING through the lens of “is someone lying to me?”. Emails, text messages, downloading software from a website/App Store, job offers, investment opportunities, etc.the surface area is limitless. There’s exactly zero chance that even an experienced professional with excellent eyesight, who reads up on the newest scams, who doesn’t have lots of family / social events to care for, etc will never get hacked/scammed.Even in the cybersecurity industry, almost all companies have abandoned the idea that there will never be a breach, and have moved towards thinking about resiliency, where any breaches that do happen are minimized or closed quickly/automatically.That’s a lot of words to say: even though I thought I would never get scammed, once I spent more time educating myself about how it happens, it seems obvious to me that scams work a percentage of the time and the scale of attempts is enormous.replymiduil 10 minutes ago

Most software download sites have so many UI elements saying "Download", on their downloads page, but only one of them is the legit software you want, and others are some random software that paid money to the website to be there to... probably try to get themselves installed and scam you some more.I just checked the Google "play" store: searching for "Temu" (I know, dumb, but there was an ad on the main screen of the store), in the page of search results, the first install button is for the sponsored Alibaba app...Even billion dollar businesses are... trying to scam you.

I think the subtext of what I wrote in that paragraph was about the additional cognitive load of having to worry about every little action. For most people who are less informed about scams/cybersecurity, there is a lower cognitive load tax on their mind/attention. Or put another way, the heuristics they use are at a different point on the tradeoff curve between effort/resources and accuracy.replybdangubic 1 hour ago

A few years ago, I wrote a blog post about my approach to risk management[0].I generally look at risk as a two-dimensional graph, with the axes being Probability and Severity, and the action strategies as being Prevention, Mitigation, and Remedy.If we get realistic about likelihood and impact, we can figure out how to reduce the damage.One trick a wealthy friend of mine uses, is keeping a small checking account, that he fills with just enough cash from his brokerage, so that even if his cards/accounts get pwned, he can't lose that much.[0] https://littlegreenviper.com/risky-business/replybdangubic 5 minutes ago

I have followed one simple principle for the last 16 years and have been incident-free. The communication with every business I am affiliated with in any way is one-way - I contact them. I never answer any calls or texts and I never answer any emails. no exceptions. It is amazing how much this simple rule just works.

> I remember reading a headline that being poor is equivalent to losing about 5 IQ points.Poor people also spend a lot of time using cash equivalents rather than credit.There is a big advantage to using credit.
For example, I don't worry too much about fraud on my credit card as the reversibility means that the banking system is taking care of it.
If a suspicious transaction hits my ATM card, the bank absolutely jumps on it since it simply doesn't match my patterns of usage.On the other hand, if you are using your ATM card or cash transfer apps all the time, you're a ripe target for getting scammed.
The protections are much weaker and the reversibility (if any) is much worse.This doesn't even get into the fact that, as a poor person, the people you are transacting with are also stuck in the same system for various reasons of various levels of dubiousness.replythephyber 1 hour ago

Different take:At the risk of accidentally demonizing the poor, I remember reading a think piece that could be summarized as “morals/ethics are a luxury only the rich can afford.” The gist is that if you can’t afford to quit your job on the spot and not worry about paying rent this month, you will always be victim to your boss’s unethical actions lowering your ethical standards.As an engineer, I have frequently challenged myself to empathize with the VW emissions scandal engineers, who were pressured to meet unrealistic emissions and deadlines. The managers didn’t have to explicitly tell them to build emissions testing defectors — they came up with that as an engineering solution to the requirements they were given. I ask myself: at what point would you have quit, and hopefully told the authorities?Also more recent example is the staff of the submarine that went down to the site of the Titanic and imploded. The CEO was apparently an unbelievable bully and took extraordinary risks, but the staff didn’t quit. One of them was a Scottish immigrant who moved his whole family to take the job. He was also worried about being blacklisted from the entire private sector submarine industry. There was a lot of friction to being able to exercise his highest ethical standards.Thailand is more or less at war with Cambodian war lords, who have tens of thousands of poor English speakers from around the world living in captivity, their passports taken away, running long term scams over the internet. When they have no money and no power to run, is it fair to blame the low level scammers for having fallen for a job scam months or years ago?The more financial pressure you are under, the more likely you are to tolerate an unethical environment.replyveeti 54 minutes ago

IIRC they chat group was using LINE, where the scammers can delete messages / kick people at will.
So more people joining just to make a few bucks from the initial payout just increases the credibility of the operation.Also the initial "tasks" the mark performs are worth only like a few USD.

Even the best of people can fall for scams. It depends on how much you need the money. No one starts off thinking they are going to be scammed. The design ensures people enter this trap slowly. When people are hesitant they are given a taste of success - the 500%. Some people tap out here. Others want to continue to try their luck. But often they are stopped with reverse psychology that there are no low pay jobs and they need to pitch in more money.replymlinhares 6 hours ago

It's probably one of the biggest criticism about PIX, the Brazilian method of transferring money: it's too easy.

Criminals always find a way Decades ago, there was a popular activity called "Paseos Millonarios" (More or less, Millionare Rides) where criminals at night picked up a victim coming out of an ATM, and took him to several other ATMs around, everytime drawing non-suspicious amounts of money. The criminals didn't even need the PIN. They neither entered the ATM hut because only the card holder was sent in.The final solution was disabling the ATM network durimg night, except the ones located in safe places. Showing you are drawing money in a hurry in a lone hut in the night was a bad idea, anyways.replyrobocat 37 minutes ago

I live in Thailand, many expat accounts have been closed down, making it very hard to pay bills etc. in the country. That will form part of the 3 million. Huge overreaction that will dent the economy and will no doubt be flip-flopped on in a few months time.replybjcy 5 hours ago
| parent | next [–]
It’s important to note that many of the expat accounts have been closed down due to the laxity of individual bank branches in enforcing their own policies, which were taken advantage of by nefarious actors. Many expats attempt to open bank accounts on tourist visas (which include the recently popular Destination Thailand Visa for digital nomads) without proper identification, and though allowed in the past, is now being restricted. One can argue about the classification of visas and the dissonance between economic goals and immigration policy, but for Thais, this is a long overdue enforcement action especially as it regards to scams targeting an older generation. Yes, it significantly impacts honest expats looking to stay beyond the short-term, but there is a way to doing things in Thailand that requires guests to adapt to their hosts, of which accepting the reality of Thailand’s political situations is an important part.replyJumpCrisscross 5 hours ago

1. The kind that is looking at visiting Thailand as a cheap way to booze, party, smoke weed, and do other stuff. They do not spend enough money to move the needle economically in a country where the majority of the economy is connected to automotive and electronics manufacturing2. The kind that try to reside in Thailand long term but don't want to file for immigration, so using various loopholes like the "Visa dash" or paying for Thai language classes with no attendance or requirements to attend the class. Lots of drop shippers are doing this and are dodging incorporation taxes in Thailand3. The kind that come to only train Muay Thai or BJJ, but don't contribute to the rest of the economy (I'm guilty of this). Living and training exclusive at a Fairtex or a Sityodong isn't percolating capital in the rest of Thailand.All 3 of these types of expats and tourists are barely spending $500/mo in Thailand after rent or hotel spend, and simply don't contribute to the Thai economy to the same degree the other sectors of the economy are. The only reason those 3 types of tourists are tolerated is because the businesses they patronize are overwhelmingly owned by local politicians and give them pocket change, but aren't actually useful from an economic perspective, because it has depressed wages, and exacerbated organized crime.Heritage and upscale tourism is a separate story, because the premiums that can be demanded and the wages and skills needed incentivize upskilling as well as building a white money local ecosystem.replysomenameforme 4 hours ago

This is tangential but relevant - Thailand's current fertility rate has fallen to 1, substantially less than Japan even. And this fertility collapse happened long enough that they've already entered into the population decline phase - with accelerating declines over the past 4 years.It's still the early stages, but Thailand is going to unavoidably be entering into demographic collapse over the coming decades. So tourism, especially when it results in attracting lawful/educated/etc long-term residents, provides more than however much money people can spend.Of course Thais themselves just need to start having a lot more babies, but it's not looking like that's going to happen. The whole world is going to look so different in 50 years, even if literally nothing whatsoever changed from a technological POV. Fertility issues are going to radically reshape the entire world and the balance of powers, perspectives, even religions, and much more.replylogicchains 2 hours ago

Also worth thinking about inflation with this one.The $10,000 figure originated with the 1970 Bank Secrecy Act[1].
Back then, that was a lot of money.If it had kept up with plain old vanilla government-reported inflation, the number would be closer to $83,000 today[2].---[1] https://www.fincen.gov/resources/statutes-and-regulations/ba...[2] https://www.dollartimes.com/inflation/inflation.php?amount=1...replypetermcneeley 1 hour ago

What's the real reason? Fraud has been around forever now. How is it that people were able to create so many mule accounts in the first place? What sort of KYC was going on? Why start limiting bank accounts without warning?So many questions...Update: my Thai friend just wrote me this:"Not in trouble, it's the Chinese and Russians money laundering.
Every Russian has had their accounts suspended, this was about half a year ago, now they are slowly doing the Chinese and Brits too. Vietnam is not much better, also suspending all foreigners accounts until you can prove you have a trc here."Update2: just saw this on IG… https://www.instagram.com/p/DOZM0ZOkUAy/replycharlieyu1 1 hour ago

Sadly, people who would fall into this are not hard to find in Thailand.> What sort of KYC was going on?There are accounts that are grandfathered in and don’t require KYC but have been able to access online banking, etc. Mine is such, and my bank (BAY) is discontinuing that particular loophole at the end of this month.

We've been having a similar fraud issue here in South Korea as well. These criminals call vulnerable people, impersonate bankers or government officials, and social-engineer them into trasferring money. Some even pretend to have kidnapped your child, play AI-generated voice of a sobbing kid, and demand ransom.Fraud has always been around, but I think a few recent developments have exacerbated the problem. KYC has been relaxed a lot since Covid, so you can open a whole bunch of accounts with just an image of an ID card. Lots of elderly people now have access to mobile banking, so they don't have to visit a physical branch where a clerk can flag suspicious transfer requests.Bank accounts in South Korea now start with a daily transfer limit of 1 million won (about $700), even lower than the 50k bhat limit that the Thai government has instituted.replywalterbell 5 hours ago

Does "MM" usually stand for "million"? In German we have "Millionen" and then "Milliarden", but in English that is "Billion", so "MM" cannot stand for "Milliarden" either. And "Mega" already is *10^6, but only has 1 "M". So at first naturally I read "Million Million", but then thought: "What? There is no way they have that many accounts!"It is a very confusing way to write the number and no explanation seems to fit, other than "There is a second 'M' to avoid clash with the company name '3M'.". Is that the explanation?replywalterbell 5 hours ago

To represent one million in finance, the abbreviation “MM” is widely used. This notation originates from “mille mille,” meaning “thousand thousands” in Latin, equating to one million. This clarity makes “MM” a preferred choice in financial statements and reports.replylotsofpulp 4 hours ago

I’m in finance and exclusively use the M and K to reference millions and thousands. Everyone says the MM is more accurate and I get that from a Roman numeral perspective it may be (if you ignore that it actually means 2000), yet I’ve never once encountered anyone using M as a thousand in the writing or reading of financial figures. I think it’s primarily a financial news, journalism/writing style, I rarely see it in business at all. Sometimes I see MM from the PE/banker guys and that’s about the only time I see it IRL.replychowells 4 hours ago

Ok, I see where the "actually 2000" misconception would come from. A mile is 2000 steps, and "mile" comes from "mille".But "mille" means 1000. Specifically, it was the distance covered by 1000 paces from a marching Roman soldier. It's more consistent to measure paces than steps in the face of left/right asymmetries, so it's the unit implied when you just say you're marching 1000.replyIndrekR 5 hours ago

I’ve never seen ‘mm’ nor ‘mn’ used in British English, where ‘m’ is a common abbreviation for “million”. But this might be a localisation.Wikipedia does recognise ‘m’ as an abbreviation: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1,000,000It’s definitely open to confusion but generally if you already known that abbreviation exists then one can usually deduce how to interpret that abbreviation from the context of the sentence. In this case, it’s a financial headline so I assumed it was “million”.replyJumpCrisscross 5 hours ago

The abbreviation “M” for million can lead to confusion in finance. Historically, “M” derives from the Latin word “mille,” meaning “thousand.” As such, it has traditionally been used in some accounting or construction contexts to denote a thousand. For example, $5M could historically represent $5,000, creating ambiguity.
To represent one million in finance, the abbreviation “MM” is widely used. This notation originates from “mille mille,” meaning “thousand thousands” in Latin, equating to one million. This clarity makes “MM” a preferred choice in financial statements and reports.
Other abbreviations for million, such as “mn” or “mln,” are also encountered.. The Financial Times, for example, adopted “mn” for millions to improve accessibility for text-to-speech software. While these alternatives exist, “MM” remains a prevalent and widely understood abbreviation for million in American finance.replymmh0000 5 hours ago
