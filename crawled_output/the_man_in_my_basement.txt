Peter Bradshaw
Guardian
The story feels like a supernatural horror or a ghost story, and yet doesn’t conform to either... It’s an eerie, disquieting experience.

Financial Times
The nerves are kept at a steady jangle, but the movie also hums with ideas. Too many for one story, some may say, though from where I’m sitting, better that than too few.
Rated: 4/5

New York Times
Charles is an interesting character, and so, for that matter, is Anniston, and Narciss too. But they feel a little more like stand-ins for ideas than like three-dimensional people.

Carla Renata
The Curvy Film Critic
Although, The Man in the Basement suffers at times as a muddled psychological thriller whose subtext, in many instances takes over, it's the beautifully anchored performances by the  Dafoe and Hawkins, that make this adaptation worth the watch.

Daily Mail (UK)
The acting is fine but the plot is convoluted and the dialogue over-written.
Rated: 2/5

Jim Vorel
Paste Magazine
For far too much of its bloated runtime, it becomes an incomprehensible slideshow of trauma and weakly executed horror imagery, only occasionally revealing the far more effective, character-driven psychological thriller it’s clearly yearning to be.
Rated: 6.0/10

Interesting storytelling and solid acting w a decent build up that didnt end up revealing anything to the audience they dont already know, so the ending ends up half hearted.
