Build Apps with Google AI Studio: AI-Powered Ingredient Analysis for Smarter Shopping
#devchallenge

This is a submission for the Google AI Studio Multimodal Challenge
What I Built
ShopHealth Assistant is an AI-powered mobile application that revolutionizes how consumers understand product ingredients. By simply uploading an image or using live camera capture, users can instantly analyze packaged products to identify potential health risks, allergens, and additives. The app provides a comprehensive health score (0-100) with color-coded risk indicators and detailed ingredient breakdowns, making informed shopping decisions effortless.
The problem this solves is critical: most consumers struggle to understand complex ingredient lists and identify potential health concerns in packaged foods. ShopHealth Assistant democratizes this knowledge by providing instant, intelligent analysis that anyone can understand.
Demo
Github Repo: https://github.com/mr-teslaa/ai-shop-health-assistant/
The application features a clean, intuitive interface with three main interaction modes:
Upload Image: Traditional image upload functionality for analyzing product labels
Take Picture: Camera integration for capturing product images on-the-go
Realtime Scan: Live camera preview with real-time analysis and audio feedback
Key features demonstrated:
Risk score calculation with color-coded badges (green/yellow/red)
Detailed ingredient categorization (additives, sweeteners, allergens, etc.)
Statistical breakdown showing total ingredients, additives, and sweeteners
Interactive drawer interface for seamless user experience
Audio narration for accessibility and hands-free operation
Note: The screenshots show the app's sophisticated UI with risk scoring, ingredient analysis, and the three-tab navigation system for different scanning modes.
How I Used Google AI Studio
Google AI Studio's multimodal capabilities power the core functionality of ShopHealth Assistant through several key implementations:
Vision API Integration: Utilized Gemini's vision models to extract text from product packaging images with high accuracy OCR capabilities
Natural Language Processing: Leveraged Gemini's language understanding to parse and normalize ingredient lists from raw OCR text
Structured Data Extraction: Implemented prompt engineering to consistently return JSON-formatted results matching our scan_result schema
Real-time Processing: Optimized API calls for live camera analysis with minimal latency
Confidence Scoring: Utilized Gemini's built-in confidence metrics to provide reliable analysis results
The application architecture uses Google AI Studio as the primary ML backend, handling complex multimodal tasks that would require multiple specialized models if built from scratch.
Multimodal Features
The Gemini 2.5 Pro capabilities significantly enhance the user experience:
Vision + Language Processing:
Combines OCR text extraction with semantic understanding using Gemini Pro Vision to identify ingredients even when product labels have complex layouts, multiple languages, or poor image quality
Processes barcode information alongside ingredient text for comprehensive product identification
Real-time Multimodal Analysis:
Live camera processing with instant visual feedback powered by Gemini Pro Vision
Audio narration feature that speaks analysis results, making the app accessible for visually impaired users or hands-free scenarios
Contextual understanding that can differentiate between ingredient lists and other text on packaging
Intelligent Content Understanding:
Recognizes ingredient categories (allergens, additives, sweeteners) using Gemini Pro Vision without requiring extensive training data
Normalizes ingredient names across different naming conventions and languages
Provides confidence scores for each detected element, ensuring users know the reliability of the analysis
The Gemini Pro Vision multimodal approach transforms what would traditionally be a cumbersome manual process into an intuitive, accessible, and highly accurate automated solution. Users can now make informed health decisions in seconds rather than minutes, regardless of their technical expertise or familiarity with ingredient terminology.
Built with React (Vite) for the frontend, containerized with Docker and served through Nginx, powered by Google AI Studio's Gemini models. The application demonstrates practical AI implementation for consumer health and wellness, with a production-ready containerized deployment setup for scalability and reliability.
