For some reason the VibeVoice model from Microsoft (which is also able to clone voices and is also very good) has been deleted from GitHub 10 days ago even tough it was released under a MIT license. But this post shows that the cat is out of the bag for some time already now (post is from 2021) and we have to live with this technology.replyqwertox 1 hour ago

Cloning the repo isn't enough, because Microsoft/Github still control the platform, and can delete all copies they have control over.replydceddia 38 minutes ago

Cloning the repo (running git clone on your computer) is enough because it makes a local copy. Forking merely makes a copy under your account on GitHub though which is not going to survive if they go on a deleting spree.replymacawfish 2 hours ago
