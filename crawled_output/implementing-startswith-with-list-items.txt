The goal of the snippet is to check each item for "# ", if found I'd like to then use the rest of the item will become the directory that new files will be saved to. This will be a markdown parser with the ability to update existing files, so i need to be able to turn the files into lists to compare and insert or just create a new document
This is where ive become stuck, i do have a working parser but it only works if creating new files, adding in the ability to merge has been a wall
fileA_contents = []
fileA_read = file.readlines()
fileA_contents.append(fileA_read)
print(fileA_contents)
for item in fileA_contents:
if item[0:1] == "# ":
print("found")
current_directory = folder+item[2:]+"/"
#os.makedirs(folder+item[2:], exist_ok=True)
print(current_directory)
