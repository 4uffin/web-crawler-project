It is my go to when a whiteboard demonstration is not powerful enough! Great to balance out more formal assignments. I've noticed much higher motivation from students to complete Brilliant tasks (and retention of ideas is also notable).Yegor Z.High school computer science teacherFor students that are eager to learn, Brilliant is a great way to give them that opportunity to explore advanced math concepts or other areas of interest. For struggling students, it allows them to visually see new ways to approach problems. I have gotten so much great feedback from students!Kennedy M.10th grade math teacherI use Brilliant with 70+ students in Pre-Algebra and Algebra. Mainly as an enrichment assignment the day after a quiz. I really love the content and structure. It gets away from 'process' and into why and how concepts are connected.AnonymousMiddle school math teacherIt's is easy to access, tracks progress, and adds gamification elements to keep students engaged. It's also brilliant (pun not intended) for those high-flyers who need a bit of stretch and challenge.William D.Middle school computer science teacherI love using Brilliant to expose my students to ideas and concepts that I do not get to teach in my classes. I recommend teachers preview and share lessons that make sense for them but also give students the freedom to complete lessons in whatever topic interests them.Garrett M.9th grade science teacherStudents range in ability and experience with concepts, and Brilliant works great for inspiring those students who might have thought of math as boring. The wide ranging courses are great for offering enrichment at many levels.AnonymousHigh school math teacherWe love Brilliant! I use the logic puzzles as our warm up. We are currently using the 'Solving Equations' lessons to introduce two step equations.Jennifer H.Middle school math teacherEvery [class] begins with students working through Brilliant problems for 20-30 mins and they love it. They can work alone or in pairs/threes to solve a problem. It is an excellent way to start lessons.Carl M.7th grade technology teacherI use Brilliant as a scaffolding tool and for individual intervention.
