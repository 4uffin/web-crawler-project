We focus on adults learning quantitative skills – especially in math, data, and CS/AI – and deliver a best-in-class interactive learning experience across web and apps.Our courses teach you what you need to know, while skipping the stuff you don't – so expect more about solving equations, statistical analysis, logical deduction, neural networks, and generative AI, and less about abstract theorems and integrating complicated trig functions.We serve hundreds of thousands of paid subscribers, and we're hoping you might be the right person to contribute to accelerating our footprint to millions of customers (and changed lives).We have always prioritized building a healthy business as the backbone of achieving our mission. We are default alive (will be profitable before needing to raise), don't over-hire, and are growing usage at an exciting pace.We believe that real-time collaboration and human connection are necessary ingredients in building a high-velocity, creatively-oriented consumer product. We maintain core hours (9:30am – 2:30pm Pacific) where everyone is online, regardless of timezone. Over half of us are located near our hubs in SF and NYC, and folks outside of those cities travel to attend team offsites once-per-quarter.To learn more about our business and product, visit our About page.What's the vibe like?Our vibe is more like this:Imagine and propose the best possible outcomes.Grow in a relatively autonomous way.Work in an environment with high intensity and velocity (but where we also take plenty of vacation).Be adventurous.
