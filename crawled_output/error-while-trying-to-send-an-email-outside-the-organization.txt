I'm a newbie in this field. I've been creating a mail server with HCL Domino in 1 week for a project. But now, I'm facing a problem when sending out a mail outside like outlook and gmail. However I can only receive incoming emails from outside. Here is my error logs:
Server Error Logs
The log tells me the error messages:

I have followed the instruction to create keyfile.kyr with kyrtool, and edit the ports section in configuration tab. Can someone help me to solve this problem. Thank you
