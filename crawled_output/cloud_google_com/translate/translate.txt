Cloud Translation | Google CloudPage ContentsDocumentationCourse: translate textRelease notesArchitecture CenterTry Gemini 2.5, our most intelligent model now available in Vertex AITranslation AIAccelerate global growth with quality translation at scale, powered by GeminiTranslate websites, apps, documents, and media across 189 languages. You can leverage pre-trained and custom translation models instantly, as well as achieve nuanced accuracy with Gemini-powered Adaptive Translation, all through Cloud Translation API.Try Translation freeRequest a demoHighlightsWhat is adaptive translation?How to use Vertex AI for translation?How to use custom LLMs for translation?What's new with Translation AICheck out our latest Translation AI advancementsOverviewAdaptive translationAdaptive Translation helps you create nuanced, high-quality translations that capture the unique style, tone, and voice of your content. By combining the power of large language models (LLMs) with your own small datasets, Adaptive translation delivers results that are often on par with custom-built models – but without the complexity of training or maintaining them.Here are the languages supported by Adaptive Translation.Cloud Translation APICloud Translation API uses Google's neural machine translation technology to let you dynamically translate text through the API using a Google pre-trained, custom model, or a translation specialized large language model (LLMs). It comes in Basic and Advanced editions. Both provide fast and dynamic translation, but Advanced offers customization features, such as domain-specific translation, formatted document translation, and batch translation.The first 500,000 characters sent to the API to process (Basic and Advanced combined) per month are free (not applicable to LLMs).Model selectionFor advanced translations, you're not limited to a one-size-fits-all solution, ensuring the highest quality and accuracy for your specific content. You can choose from the following models, based on your needs:Neural Machine Translation (NMT) for general text in everyday use cases like website content or news articles.Translation Large Language Model (LLM) for conversational text like messages or social media posts. You can use "Adaptive" mode to fine-tune translations based on your own examples for an even closer match to your unique style.Media file translation, subtitling and voice-over solutionsFor a simple translated transcript of a video or audio, Speech-to-text API transcribes your video or audio with high accuracy into a text file that can be translated by the Translation API into different languages.To subtitle your videos after transcription and translation, use Transcoder API to add subtitles.To voice-over your videos in different languages, transcribe and translate, then use Cloud Text-to-speech API to synthesize custom, lifelike speech in 380+ voices across 50+ languages.Multilingual contact center solution for global marketsCombining Customer Engagement Suite and Translation API allows you to assist a customer interaction happening in two different languages seamlessly across phone and chat, all in real-time. CCAI helps break language barriers by natively supporting both customer sentiment and call driver analysis, across many different languages. These analyses can be fed back to agents, in their preferred language, for better call outcomes and customer experience.Data privacy and securityGoogle Cloud has industry-leading capabilities that give you—our customers—control over your data and provide visibility into when and how your data is accessed.As a Google Cloud customer, you own your customer data. We implement stringent security measures to safeguard your customer data and provide you with tools and features to control it on your terms. Customer data is your data, not Google’s.
