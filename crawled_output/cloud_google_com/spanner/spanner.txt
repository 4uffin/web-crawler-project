It is a highly scalable database that combines unlimited scalability with relational semantics, such as secondary indexes, strong consistency, schemas, and SQL providing 99.999% availability in one easy solution. Hence, it’s suitable for both relational and non-relational workloads.Does Spanner use SQL?Spanner provides two ANSI-based SQL dialects over the same rich set of capabilities: GoogleSQL and PostgreSQL. GoogleSQL shares syntax with BigQuery for teams standardizing their data management workflows. The PostgreSQL interface provides familiarity for teams who already know PostgreSQL and portability of schemas and queries to other PostgreSQL environments. For more information about the Spanner PostgreSQL interface, see our documentation.How do I migrate databases to Spanner?Migrating existing workloads to Spanner ensures a foundation for future growth, without having to compromise on reliability or price-performance. Spanner‘s multi-model interface is used today by innovative organizations across industries with operational workloads coming from relational databases, like MySQL and SQL Server, key-value stores, such as Cassandra or DynamoDB, along with graph, search, and document tools. The specific approach for a migration will depend on requirements around data volume, performance SLOs, and availability. Spanner migration tool provides end-to-end assessment, schema and data migration, and low-downtime cutover for sharded MySQL and Cassandra databases as well as assessment and migration for PostgreSQL. A qualified network of technology and services partners can accelerate migrations from just about any source.What are the key considerations for operating Spanner?Spanner is a fully managed database so it automatically provides comprehensive infrastructure management features, but there are some application-specific management actions that may be required depending on your workload. You will need to make sure that you have set up proper alerting and monitoring and that you are watching those closely to ensure production is always running smoothly. You need to understand what actions to take when traffic grows organically over time, or if there is peak traffic expected, or how to handle data corruption due to application bugs, and last but not least, how to troubleshoot performance issues and understand what components are responsible for increased latencies.Other resources and supportSpanner EcosystemAsk the
