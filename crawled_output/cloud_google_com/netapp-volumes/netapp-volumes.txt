Normally, we don't land all three. But with Google Cloud Netapp Volumes, we were able to. Wayfair is an e-commerce company. And for us, that's connecting a catalog of 20 million products to tens of millions of customers, and having a technology platform that can drive and support that layer of personalization. Our previous storage solution was still one of our free cloud legacy implementations, and it wasn't letting our experience teams take full advantage of Google Cloud and the proper distributed and scalable workloads...Google Cloud Netapp Volumes lets us put that data closer to our customer experience. It lets us distribute it closer to where our compute and software solutions live, and it builds more of a geographic diversity to our platform.Watch videoRelated ContentAkumin leverages technology from Google Cloud to stay at the forefront of innovation in healthcare.

It also excels with high-performance demands like EDA. Performance varies by service level (Flex, Standard, Premium, Extreme), offering up to 30 GiB/s throughput for single volumes on Premium and Extreme. Flex provides independent capacity and performance scaling, reaching 5 GiB/s throughput and 160K IOPS, ensuring optimal resource allocation.How does Google Cloud NetApp Volumes help with data protection, business continuity, and disaster recovery? It offers robust data protection via automated, space-efficient snapshots for rapid recovery and integrated backup for long-term retention. Cross-region volume replication enables strong disaster recovery and business continuity. Flex Regional protects against zonal outages and rapid cloning for dev/test environments further reduce downtime and accelerate development. These features minimize RPOs and RTOs, crucial for enterprise-grade data resilience.What about security and compliance? Can Google Cloud NetApp Volumes help my organization meet its regulatory obligations?Absolutely. Data is secured with encryption at rest and in transit, supporting Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK). Access is controlled by Google Cloud IAM and integrated with Active Directory. All data access occurs via private VPC connections. Critically, it supports Google Cloud Assured Workloads to help meet stringent compliance requirements (e.g., ISO, SOC, HIPAA) with pre-configured environments and detailed audit logging, simplifying regulatory adherence.How does Google Cloud NetApp Volumes help reduce costs and optimize storage in the cloud? It optimizes costs through consumption-based pricing and flexible service levels, allowing you to right-size performance and capacity. The Flex service level uniquely allows independent scaling of capacity and performance for precise resource allocation. Additionally, Auto-Tiering (available on Flex Zonal, Premium and Extreme service levels) will provide customers an option to automatically move infrequently accessed data from a high-performance, high-cost storage tier (hot tier) to a lower-cost, lower-performance storage tier (cold tier). Furthermore, Committed Use Discounts (CUDs) offer significant savings for predictable usage, and as a fully managed service, it reduces operational overhead.Explore documentationGo to
