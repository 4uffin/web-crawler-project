It’s powered by the same engine that underlies the cloud-based AlloyDB service and provides the same functionality. AlloyDB Omni is a fraction of the cost of legacy databases, so it’s an attractive way to modernize to an enterprise-grade version of PostgreSQL with support from a Tier 1 vendor.AlloyDB Omni on GCE5:34AI-driven development and operationsSimplify all aspects of the database journey with AI-powered assistance, helping your teams focus on what matters most. AlloyDB Studio offers a query editor where you can use Gemini to write SQL and analyze your data using natural language prompts. Database Center provides a comprehensive view of your database fleet with intelligent performance and security recommendations, and you can enable Gemini for an easy-to-use chat interface to ask questions and get optimization recommendations.Supercharge your management with AI3:25Real-time business insightsThanks to its built-in columnar engine, AlloyDB is up to 100x faster than standard PostgreSQL for analytical queries*, with zero impact on operational performance when running business intelligence, reporting, and hybrid transactional and analytical workloads (HTAP). You can also stream data or use federated queries with BigQuery and call machine learning models in Vertex AI directly within a query or transaction.Under the hood: columnar engineHow it accelerates your analytical queriesRead the blogFully managed database serviceAlloyDB is a fully managed database service with cloud-scale architecture and industry-leading performance, availability, and scale. It automates administrative tasks such as backups, replication, patching, and capacity management, and uses adaptive algorithms and machine learning for PostgreSQL vacuum management, storage management, memory management, data tiering, and analytics acceleration, so you can focus on building your applications.Bayer Crop Science unlocks harvest data efficiency2:07PostgreSQL compatibilityPostgreSQL has emerged in recent years as a leading alternative to legacy, proprietary databases because of its rich functionality, ecosystem extensions, and enterprise readiness. AlloyDB is fully compatible with PostgreSQL, providing flexibility and true portability for your workloads. It’s easy to migrate existing workloads and bring your existing PostgreSQL skills over.Is AlloyDB compatible with PostgreSQL?2:37High availabilityAlloyDB offers a 99.99% uptime SLA, inclusive of maintenance. It automatically detects and recovers from most database failures within 60 seconds, independent of database size and load. The architecture supports non-disruptive instance resizing and database maintenance, with planned operations incurring less than 1 second of application downtime. Read pools are updated with zero downtime.ScalabilityScale AlloyDB instances up and down to support almost any workload and deploy up to 20 read replicas for read scalability. You can also create secondary clusters in different regions for disaster recovery, have them continuously replicated from the primary region, and promote them in case of an outage. Regional replicas deliver more than 25x lower replication lag than standard PostgreSQL for high throughput transactional workloads. They also improve read performance by bringing data closer to your users.Character.ai scales its growing gen AI platform2:46Secure access and connectivityAlloyDB encrypts data in transit and at rest. It supports private connectivity with Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) for secure connectivity to your applications, and allows you to access your database instances via private IP without going through the internet or using external IP addresses. You can manage your own encryption keys to encrypt data at rest for your database and your backups, and you can choose between Identity and Access Management (IAM) and PostgreSQL user roles for database authentication.Customer-friendly pricingEliminate your dependency on high-cost, proprietary databases, and take advantage of transparent and predictable pricing with no proprietary licensing or opaque I/O charges. Storage is automatically managed and you're only charged for what you use, with no additional storage costs for read replicas. An ultra-fast, automatically provisioned cache allows you to maximize the price-performance ratio. Committed use discounts offer additional savings for one to three year commitments. And AlloyDB Omni offers another simple and affordable deployment option.AlloyDB vs. the competitionBenchmarking AlloyDB's performance and value for moneyRead the reportContinuous backup and recoveryProtect your business from data loss with point-in-time recovery to any point within your defined retention window. Restore the database to a specific date and time for development, testing, and auditing purposes, or recover your production database from user or application errors. You no longer need expensive hardware and software solutions to achieve enterprise-level data protection.Under the hood: business continuityBuild highly resilient applications with AlloyDBRead the blogEasy migrationsNo matter where your source database is located—whether on-premises, on Compute Engine, or in other clouds—Database Migration Service (DMS) can migrate it to AlloyDB securely and with minimal downtime. DMS leverages native PostgreSQL replication capabilities and automated schema and code conversion, as necessary, to maximize the reliability of your migration. Gemini adds AI-powered assistance for heterogeneous database migrations, helping you review and convert database-resident code and offering full explanability.
