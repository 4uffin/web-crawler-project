Users can explore existing tiles, asking new questions, expanding filters, and drilling down to row level detail to fully understand the data behind a metric.Looker Studio offers interactive, collaborative, and ad hoc reports and dashboards, with access to over 800 data sources and connectors and a flexible drag-and-drop canvas. You have the option to perform ad hoc analysis on both governed and unmodeled data. It's free, fast, and easy to start. Simplify and secure your analytics with Looker on Google CloudLooker on Google Cloud takes the existing powerful capabilities from the Looker platform and seamlessly integrates it into the secure Google Cloud ecosystem. Features our customers have come to love and expect in all Google Cloud products are now also available with Looker on Google Cloud, including SSO with Google Cloud IAM, private networking, seamless integration with BigQuery, and a unified Terms of Service.Build custom data experiences and data apps with Looker’s powerful embedded capabilitiesEmbedded analytics goes beyond placing dashboards in apps. It's about transforming data into deeply integrated, value-driving experiences. With Looker, fully interactive dashboards can be seamlessly integrated into your applications. The robust API coverage allows you to do just about anything from the UI through API. This unlocks limitless possibilities to create data experiences beyond a Looker dashboard. In addition, Looker extensions integrate directly with Vertex AI, enabling powerful custom AI workflows and advanced analytics within your Looker instance.View all featuresHow It WorksLooker is Google for your business data and enables you to make your organization's information accessible and useful. Looker Studio enables you to tell impactful, insightful stories with engaging reports and data visualizations.Together, you put inspiration and opportunity into the hands of the people who make things happen.Get started with LookerLooker: Google for your business dataCommon UsesReduce cross-cloud spendingTutorials, quickstarts, & labsLooker for cloud cost managementMany large companies now use multiple cloud platforms (multicloud or hybrid cloud). This leads to complex billing from multiple providers, and current solutions often lack transparency or are too expensive. Companies need a cost-effective way to gain insights into their cross-cloud spending and optimize their costs.With Looker, you get robust out-of-the-box reporting for your day-to-day needs and long-term optimization initiatives. Looker helps you easily identify the one-off high cost problems faster and slow burn global inefficiencies sooner.Looker for cloud cost managementTutorials, quickstarts, & labsLooker for cloud cost managementMany large companies now use multiple cloud platforms (multicloud or hybrid cloud).
