Built on Google’s deep expertise and decades of experience in semantic search technologies, Vertex AI Search delivers more relevant results across your content, both structured and unstructured.Get started in minutes and tailor search experiences to your specific needs with extensive customization abilities.Getting started can be as easy as simply adding a search widget for an improved website search experience.If you are building generative AI applications, Vertex AI Search can function as a grounding or Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system using your data.Vertex AI Search is designed for enterprise environments, offering seamless scalability, robust privacy controls, and comprehensive governance features.Optimized for industriesVertex AI Search has specialized offerings tuned for unique industry requirements like searching product catalogs, media libraries, and clinical data repositories. Vertex AI Search for commerce offers retailers the ability to improve the search, product recommendations, and browsing experience on their channels.Vertex AI Search for media offers media and entertainment companies the ability to provide more personalized content recommendations powered by generative AI, increasing consumer time spent on their platforms, which can lead to higher engagement, revenue, and retention. Vertex AI Search for healthcare and life sciences is a medically tuned search that improves patient and provider experience.Solution for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) in the enterprise Today, there is a lot of excitement about RAG, an architecture that combines LLMs with a data retrieval system, or in other words, a search engine. Grounding LLM responses in your company's own data improves the accuracy, reliability, and relevance of generative AI apps, something that's critical for real-world business applications. You could build your own RAG system but this can be a highly complex process. Vertex AI Search functions as an out-of-the-box RAG system for information retrieval. Under the hood with Vertex AI Search, we’ve simplified the end-to-end search and discovery process of managing ETL, OCR, chunking, embedding, indexing, storing, input cleaning, schema adjustments, information retrieval, and summarization to just a few clicks. This makes it easy for you to build RAG-powered apps using Vertex AI Search as your retrieval engine. Vertex AI also offers a comprehensive set of APIs that help developers create bespoke RAG solutions. These APIs expose the underlying components of Vertex AI Search's out-of-the-box RAG system, empowering developers to address custom use cases or serve customers who want granular control. These include the Document AI Layout Parser API, ranking API, grounded generation API, and check grounding API.Vector search for embeddings based applications Vertex AI Search lets organizations and developers set up search engines out of the box. These search engines offer adequate customization for most enterprise needs and even offer automatic fine-tuning for embeddings. In some cases, you may have custom embeddings, and Vertex AI Search works fine with your own embeddings. However, more advanced developers who need direct control of a highly performant vector database to power niche use cases like recommendations and ad serving can use vector search, the vector database used by Vertex AI Search as a component for their use cases. We’ve recently updated Vector Search’s user experience so developers can create and deploy indexes without coding. We’ve also significantly reduced indexing latency from hours to minutes for smaller datasets.AI for document understanding Vertex AI search benefits from the document processing capabilities of our Document AI suite. With document understanding you can easily turn structured and unstructured documents into actionable data to increase operational efficiency, simplify business processes, and make better decisions.Industry-compliant data privacy and securityWhen you use Vertex AI Search from Google Cloud, your data is secure in your cloud instance. Google does not access or use your data to train models or for any other purpose you have not explicitly authorized. Vertex AI Search also meets specific industry compliance standards like HIPAA, ISO 27000-series, and SOC -1/2/3. We’re expanding support for access transparency to provide customers with awareness of Googler administrative access to their data. Virtual Private Cloud Service Controls prevent customers or employees from infiltrating or exfiltrating data. We are also offering Customer-managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) in Preview, allowing customers to encrypt their core content with their own encryption keys. Data freshness through connectorsVertex AI Search can connect to your first-party, Google, and third-party applications through Vertex AI extensions and data connectors. Vertex AI extensions help in ingesting data and drive transactions on the users' behalf while data connectors ingest data with read-only access to key applications like Jira, Confluence, and Salesforce. Together, Vertex AI extensions and data connectors ensure your data is fresh across your search engines. View all featuresHow It WorksWith Vertex AI Search, you can go from frustrating keyword matching to modern conversational search experiences. You can also improve the quality of your generative AI applications by grounding them in your enterprise data using Vertex AI Search as an out of the box system for Retrieval Augmented Generation or RAG.
