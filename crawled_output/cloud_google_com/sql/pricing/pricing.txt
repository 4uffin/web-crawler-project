Cloud SQL pricing | Google CloudPage ContentsCloud SQL pricingYou can create an account to evaluate how Cloud SQL performs in real-world scenarios. New customers also get $300 in free credits to spend on Cloud SQL to run, test, and deploy workloads. You won't be charged until you upgrade.Sign up to try Cloud SQL for free.This page contains information about pricing for Cloud SQL.Cloud SQL offers two editions, Enterprise and Enterprise Plus. These editions provide different levels of availability, performance and data protection. The pricing for the vCPUs and memory for each edition varies. Cloud SQL Enterprise edition and Cloud SQL Enterprise Plus edition are supported by Cloud SQL for MySQL, Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL, and Cloud SQL for SQL Server.Pricing for Cloud SQL depends on your instance type:MySQL and PostgreSQLSQL ServerMySQL and PostgreSQL pricingCloud SQL pricing is composed of the following charges:CPU and memory pricingStorage and networking pricingInstance pricingCloud DNS pricingExtended support pricingCPU and memory pricingFor dedicated-core instances, you choose the number of CPUs and the amount of memory you want, up to 96 CPUs and 624 GiB of memory for Enterprise edition and up to 128 CPUs and 864 GiB of memory for Enterprise Plus edition. For Cloud SQL Enterprise Plus edition for SQL Server instances, you can also choose from performance-optimized machines (up to 128 CPUs and 864 GiB of memory) and memory-optimized machines (up to 16 CPUs and 512 GiB of memory). Pricing for CPUs and memory depends on the region where your instance is located. Select your region in the dropdown on the pricing table.Read replicas and failover replicas are charged at the same rate as stand-alone instances.HA prices are applied for instances configured for high availability, also called regional instances. Learn more about high availability.Cloud SQL also offers committed use discounts (CUDs) that provide deeply discounted prices in exchange for your commitment to continuously use database instances in a particular region for a one- or three-year term. In the pricing tables on this page, the prices for CUDs are listed as commitments.

Cloud SQL uses seconds as the time unit multiplier for usage. This means that each second of usage counts toward a full billable minute.

If usage is under half a second, (499ms or less), it rounds down to zero and does not count toward billable usage.For example:If you use an instance for 499ms, you are not billed for that second.If you use an instance for 500ms or 1.49 seconds, in both cases, you are billed for 1 second.If you use an instance for 1.5 seconds or 2.49 seconds, in both cases you are billed for 2 seconds.Serverless export pricingServerless export prices depend on the region where the instance is located. Select your region using the dropdown on the pricing table.Note: Committed use discounts don't apply to serverless export prices. If you perform frequent exports of a subset of your Cloud SQL instance (for example, by using the database, table, or query parameter), then it's more cost effective for you to create a read replica for your primary instance and perform your exports from that instance. You avoid impacting your database with your exports, and lower your costs because you're paying for the read replica only, and not for each export.In the following table, select your region from the dropdown menu to see the price for that region.Iowa (us-central1)Johannesburg (africa-south1)Taiwan (asia-east1)Hong Kong (asia-east2)Tokyo (asia-northeast1)Osaka (asia-northeast2)Seoul (asia-northeast3)Mumbai (asia-south1)Delhi (asia-south2)Singapore (asia-southeast1)Jakarta (asia-southeast2)Bangkok (asia-southeast3)Sydney (australia-southeast1)Melbourne (australia-southeast2)Warsaw (europe-central2)Finland (europe-north1)Stockholm (europe-north2)Madrid (europe-southwest1)Belgium (europe-west1)Berlin (europe-west10)Turin (europe-west12)London (europe-west2)Frankfurt (europe-west3)Netherlands (europe-west4)Zurich (europe-west6)Milan (europe-west8)Paris (europe-west9)Doha (me-central1)Dammam (me-central2)Tel Aviv (me-west1)Montreal (northamerica-northeast1)Toronto (northamerica-northeast2)Mexico (northamerica-south1)Sao Paulo (southamerica-east1)Santiago (southamerica-west1)Iowa (us-central1)South Carolina (us-east1)Northern Virginia (us-east4)Columbus (us-east5)Alabama (us-east7)Dallas (us-south1)Oregon (us-west1)Los Angeles (us-west2)Salt Lake City (us-west3)Las Vegas (us-west4)Phoenix (us-west8)ItemPrice (USD)Serverless export pricing$0.01 / 1 gibibyteNote: The price per GiB is calculated based on the disk size of the offload instance, which is the same as the disk size of the primary instance. This price isn't based on the amount of data exported.Cloud DNS pricingWith Cloud DNS pricing, the charge is per zone per month (regardless of whether you use your zone), and you also pay for queries against your zones. For more information, see Cloud DNS pricing.Extended support pricingNote: From February 1, 2025 through April 30, 2025, Google has waived charges for extended support. Starting on May 1, 2025, all instances running on major versions that have reached end of life (EOL) will be charged for extended support.Extended support pricing applies to Cloud SQL instances that are running major versions in extended support. Refer to the Database version policies documentation for the extended support timelines of Cloud SQL major versions.For dedicated-core instances, extended support is priced per vCPU per hour and charged for every second that the instance is running. For shared-core instances, extended support is priced per instance per hour and charged for every second that the instance is running. Extended support is charged in addition to regular instance pricing. For more details, see Billing on partial seconds. Pricing depends on the region where your instance is located.

High availability, or regional instances, will only incur the cost for a single license for the active resource.Note: As a managed service, Cloud SQL does not support BYOL (Bring your own license).You can learn more about instance creation here.Note: Committed Use Discounts do not apply to licenses.LicensePrice per Core Hour (USD)Enterprise$0.47Standard$0.13Web$0.01134Express$0Microsoft SQL Server licensing requires a core license to be assigned to each virtual CPU on your instance, with a four core minimum for each instance. Instances with fewer than 4 vCPUs will be charged for SQL Server at 4 times the license rate to comply with these requirements. For instances with 4 or more vCPUs, you will be charged for the number of SQL Server licenses that is equal to the number of vCPUs.Disabling simultaneous multithreading (SMT) reduces the number of virtual CPUs (vCPUs) per core from 2 to 1, which in turn might reduce your SQL Server licensing costs. Disabling SMT doesn't change the compute engine price for SQL Server. You are billed for the number of vCPUs defined in the SQL Server CPU configuration. The following examples show how disabling SMT affects your billing:UserSMT: enabled or disabledNumber of vCPUs on the instanceNumber of vCPUs the SQL Server licensing fees are calculated forNumber of vCPUs the compute charges are calculated forUser1Enabled888User2Disabled848User3Disabled646Note that despite disabling SMT, User3's SQL Server license fees are calculated for 4 vCPUs because SQL Server licensing requires a core license to be assigned to each virtual CPU on your instance, with a minimum of four cores for each instance.SQL Server instance licenses are charged a 1 minute minimum. After 1 minute, SQL Server instance licenses are charged in 1 second increments.Cloud DNS pricing﻿With Cloud DNS pricing, the charge is per zone per month (regardless of whether you use your zone), and you also pay for queries against your zones.
