BigQuery | Google CloudPage ContentsBigQuery pricingBigQuery is a serverless data analytics platform. You don't need to provision individual instances or virtual machines to use BigQuery. Instead, BigQuery automatically allocates computing resources as you need them. You can also reserve compute capacity ahead of time in the form of slots, which represent virtual CPUs. The pricing structure of BigQuery reflects this design.Overview of BigQuery pricingBigQuery pricing has two main components:Compute pricing is the cost to process queries, including SQL queries, user-defined functions, scripts, and certain data manipulation language (DML) and data definition language (DDL) statements.Storage pricing is the cost to store data that you load into BigQuery.BigQuery charges for other operations, including using BigQuery Omni, BigQuery ML, BI Engine, and streaming reads and writes.In addition, BigQuery has free operations and a free usage tier.Every project that you create has a billing account attached to it. Any charges incurred by BigQuery jobs run in the project are billed to the attached billing account. BigQuery storage charges are also billed to the attached billing account. You can view BigQuery costs and trends by using the Cloud Billing reports page in the Google Cloud console.Key Point: Pricing models apply to accounts, not individual projects, unless otherwise specified.Compute pricing modelsBigQuery offers a choice of two compute pricing models for running queries:On-demand pricing (per TiB). With this pricing model, you are charged for the number of bytes processed by each query. The first 1 TiB of query data processed per month is free.Capacity pricing (per slot-hour). With this pricing model, you are charged for compute capacity used to run queries, measured in slots (virtual CPUs) over time. This model takes advantage of BigQuery editions. You can use the BigQuery autoscaler or purchase slot commitments, which are dedicated capacity that is always available for your workloads, at a lower price.For more information about which pricing to choose for your workloads, see Workload management using Reservations.Gemini in BigQuery pricingSee Gemini in BigQuery Pricing Overview for information about pricing for Gemini in BigQuery.On-demand compute pricingBy default, queries are billed using the on-demand (per TiB) pricing model, where you pay for the data scanned by your queries.With on-demand pricing, you will generally have access to up to 2,000 concurrent slots, shared among all queries in a single project. Periodically, BigQuery will temporarily burst beyond this limit to accelerate smaller queries. In addition, you might occasionally have fewer slots available if there is a high amount of contention for on-demand capacity in a specific location.On-demand (per TiB) query pricing is as follows:Iowa (us-central1)Johannesburg (africa-south1)Taiwan (asia-east1)Hong Kong (asia-east2)Tokyo (asia-northeast1)Osaka (asia-northeast2)Seoul (asia-northeast3)Mumbai (asia-south1)Delhi (asia-south2)Singapore (asia-southeast1)Jakarta (asia-southeast2)Bangkok (asia-southeast3)Sydney (australia-southeast1)Melbourne (australia-southeast2)Europe (eu)Warsaw (europe-central2)Finland (europe-north1)Stockholm (europe-north2)Madrid (europe-southwest1)Belgium (europe-west1)Berlin (europe-west10)Turin (europe-west12)London (europe-west2)Frankfurt (europe-west3)Netherlands (europe-west4)Zurich (europe-west6)Milan (europe-west8)Paris (europe-west9)Doha (me-central1)Dammam (me-central2)Tel Aviv (me-west1)Montreal (northamerica-northeast1)Toronto (northamerica-northeast2)Mexico (northamerica-south1)Sao Paulo (southamerica-east1)Santiago (southamerica-west1)US (us)Iowa (us-central1)South Carolina (us-east1)Northern Virginia (us-east4)Columbus (us-east5)Alabama (us-east7)Dallas (us-south1)Oregon (us-west1)Los Angeles (us-west2)Salt Lake City (us-west3)Las Vegas (us-west4)Phoenix (us-west8)OperationPrice (USD)DetailsQueries (on-demand)0 tebibyte to 1 tebibyteFree per 1 month / account1 tebibyte and above$6.25 / 1 tebibyte, per 1 month / accountThe first 1 TiB per month is free.If you pay in a currency other than USD, the prices listed in your currency on Cloud Platform SKUs apply.Pricing detailsNote the following regarding on-demand (per TiB) query charges:BigQuery uses a columnar data structure. You're charged according to the total data processed in the columns you select, and the total data per column is calculated based on the types of data in the column. For more information about how your data size is calculated, see Estimate query costs.You are charged for queries run against shared data. The data owner is not charged when their data is accessed.You aren't charged for queries that return an error or for queries that retrieve results from the cache. For procedural language jobs this consideration is provided at a per-statement level.Charges are rounded up to the nearest MB, with a minimum 10 MB data processed per table referenced by the query, and with a minimum 10 MB data processed per query.Canceling a running query job might incur charges up to the full cost for the query if you let the query run to completion.When you run a query, you're charged according to the data processed in the columns you select, even if you set an explicit LIMIT on the results.Partitioning and clustering your tables can help reduce the amount of data processed by queries. As a best practice, use partitioning and clustering whenever possible.On-demand (per TiB) pricing is referred to as analysis pricing on the Google Cloud SKUs page.When you run a query against a clustered table, and the query includes a filter on the clustered columns, BigQuery uses the filter expression to prune the blocks scanned by the query. This can reduce the number of scanned bytes.BigQuery provides cost control mechanisms that enable you to cap your query costs. You can set:User-level and project-level custom cost controlsThe maximum bytes billed by a queryFor detailed examples of how to calculate the number of bytes processed, see Query size calculation.Capacity compute pricingBigQuery offers a capacity-based compute pricing model for customers who need additional capacity or prefer a predictable cost for query workloads rather than the on-demand price (per TiB of data processed). The capacity compute model offers pay-as-you-go pricing (with autoscaling) and optional one year and three year commitments that provide discounted prices. You pay for query processing capacity, measured in slots (virtual CPUs) over time.To enable capacity pricing, use BigQuery reservations.BigQuery slot capacity:is available in 3 editions: Standard, Enterprise, and Enterprise Plus.applies to query costs, including BigQuery ML, DML, and DDL statements.does not apply to storage costs or BI Engine costs.does not apply to streaming inserts and using the BigQuery Storage API.can leverage the BigQuery autoscaler.is billed per second with a one minute minimum.Optional BigQuery slot commitments:are available for one or three year periods.are available in Enterprise and Enterprise Plus editions.are regional capacity.

You pay for active storage and long-term storage.Active storage includes any table or table partition that has been modified in the last 90 days.Long-term storage includes any table or table partition that has not been modified for 90 consecutive days. The price of storage for that table automatically drops by approximately 50%. There is no difference in performance, durability, or availability between active and long-term storage.Iowa (us-central1)Johannesburg (africa-south1)Taiwan (asia-east1)Hong Kong (asia-east2)Tokyo (asia-northeast1)Osaka (asia-northeast2)Seoul (asia-northeast3)Mumbai (asia-south1)Delhi (asia-south2)Singapore (asia-southeast1)Jakarta (asia-southeast2)Bangkok (asia-southeast3)Sydney (australia-southeast1)Melbourne (australia-southeast2)Europe (eu)Warsaw (europe-central2)Finland (europe-north1)Stockholm (europe-north2)Madrid (europe-southwest1)Belgium (europe-west1)Berlin (europe-west10)Turin (europe-west12)London (europe-west2)Frankfurt (europe-west3)Netherlands (europe-west4)Zurich (europe-west6)Milan (europe-west8)Paris (europe-west9)Doha (me-central1)Dammam (me-central2)Tel Aviv (me-west1)Montreal (northamerica-northeast1)Toronto (northamerica-northeast2)Mexico (northamerica-south1)Sao Paulo (southamerica-east1)Santiago (southamerica-west1)US (us)Iowa (us-central1)South Carolina (us-east1)Northern Virginia (us-east4)Columbus (us-east5)Alabama (us-east7)Dallas (us-south1)Oregon (us-west1)Los Angeles (us-west2)Salt Lake City (us-west3)Las Vegas (us-west4)Phoenix (us-west8)HourlyHourlyMonthlyMonthlyOperationPrice (USD)DetailsActive logical storage$0.000031507 / 1 gibibyte hour, per 1 month / accountThe first 10 GiB is free each month.Long-term logical storage$0.000021918 / 1 gibibyte hour, per 1 month / accountThe first 10 GiB is free each month.Active physical storage$0.000054795 / 1 gibibyte hour, per 1 month / accountThe first 10 GiB is free each month.Long-term physical storage$0.000027397 / 1 gibibyte hour, per 1 month / accountThe first 10 GiB is free each month.If you pay in a currency other than USD, the prices listed in your currency on Cloud Platform SKUs apply.See the physical storage documentation for eligibility criteria.Pricing details﻿Storage pricing is based on the amount of data stored in your tables. Temporary session tables and temporary multi-statement tables are charged for active storage only. There are no charges for time travel and failsafe storage. There are no storage charges for temporary cached query result tables.The size of the data is calculated based on the data types of the individual columns. For a detailed explanation of how data size is calculated, see Data size calculation.Storage pricing is prorated per MiB, per second. For example, if you are using active logical storage in us-central1:For 512 MiB for half a month, you pay $0.00575 USDFor 100 GiB for half a month, you pay $1.15 USDFor 1 TiB for a full month, you pay $23.552 USDStorage usage is calculated in gibibytes months (GiB months), where 1 GiB is 230 bytes (1,024 MiB). Similarly, 1 tebibyte (TiB) is 240 bytes (1,024 GiB). The final usage value is the product of data size in gibibytes and storage use time in months.If the data in a table is not modified or deleted within 90 consecutive days, it is billed at the long-term storage rate. There is no degradation of performance, durability, availability, or any other functionality when a table is considered long-term storage.Each partition of a partitioned table is considered separately for long-term storage pricing. If a partition hasn't been modified in the last 90 days, the data in that partition is considered long term storage and is charged at the discounted price.If the table is edited, the price reverts back to the regular storage pricing, and the 90-day timer starts counting from zero. Anything that modifies the data in a table resets the timer, including:ActionDetailsLoading data into a tableAny load or query job that appends data to a destination table or overwrites a destination table.Copying data into a tableAny copy job appends data to a destination table or overwrites a destination table.Writing query results to a tableAny query job that appends data to a destination table or overwrites a destination table.Using data manipulation language (DML)Using a DML statement to modify table data.Using data definition language (DDL)Using a CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE statement to replace a table.Streaming data into the tableIngesting data using the tabledata.insertAll API call.All other actions do not reset the timer, including the following:Querying a tableCreating a view that queries a tableExporting data from a tableCopying a table (to another destination table)Patching or updating a table resourceFor tables that reach the 90-day threshold during a billing cycle, the price is prorated accordingly.Long-term storage pricing applies only to BigQuery storage, not to data stored in external data sources such as Bigtable, Cloud Storage, and Google Drive.Data size calculationWhen you load data into BigQuery or query the data, you're charged according to the data size. Data size is calculated based on the size of each column's data type.The size of your stored data and the size of the data processed by your queries is calculated in gibibytes (GiB), where 1 GiB is 230 bytes (1,024 MiB). Similarly, 1 tebibyte (TiB) is 240 bytes (1,024 GiB).For more information, see Data type sizes.Data Transfer Service pricingThe BigQuery Data Transfer Service charges monthly on a prorated basis.

Costs can be incurred outside of Google Cloud by using the BigQuery Data Transfer Service, such as AWS or Azure data transfer charges.Teradata migrations4. Data is not automatically deleted from your Cloud Storage bucket after it is uploaded to BigQuery. Consider deleting the data from your Cloud Storage bucket to avoid additional storage costs. See Cloud Storage pricing.Third-party Connectors5. Costs apply for connectors provided by third-party partners. The pricing model differs for different partners and connectors. For more pricing details, refer to individual connectors when enrolling in Marketplace.Google Play Package NameEvery Android app has a unique application ID that looks like a Java package name, such as com.example.myapp. The Installs report contains a column of "Package Name". The number of unique package names is used for calculating usage of transfers.Each transfer you create generates one or more runs per day. Package names are only counted on the day a transfer run completes. For example, if a transfer run begins on July 14th but completes on July 15th, the package names are counted on July 15th.If a unique package name is encountered in more than one transfer run on a particular day, it is counted only once. Package names are counted separately for different transfer configurations. If a unique package name is encountered in runs for two separate transfer configurations, the package name is counted twice.If a package name appeared every day for an entire month, you would be charged the full $25 for that month. Otherwise, if it appeared for a part of the month, the charge would be prorated.Example#1: If we sync for 1 application - com.smule.singandroid, will it cost us $25 per month + storage price for BigQuery?The answer is $25 per month (prorated) + storage/querying costs from BigQuery.Example#2: If we sync all historic data (for 10 years), will we be charged for 120 months or for 1 month, because we transferred them at once?The answer is still $25 per month (prorated) + storage/querying costs from BigQuery, since we charge $25 per unique Package Name in the Installs_country table, regardless of how many years the historic data goes back to for that unique Package Name.BigQuery Omni pricingBigQuery Omni offers the following pricing models depending on your workloads and needs.On-Demand compute pricingSimilar to BigQuery on-demand analysis model, BigQuery Omni queries, by default are billed using the on-demand (per TiB) pricing model, where you pay for the data scanned by your queries.With on-demand pricing, you will generally have access to a large pool of concurrent slots, shared among all queries in a single project.

Cross-region load jobs are billed for network usage under Network Data Transfer SKUs.Load jobs by default use a shared pool of slots. BigQuery does not make guarantees about the available capacity of this shared pool or the throughput you will see. Alternatively, you can purchase dedicated slots to run load jobs. You are charged capacity-based pricing for dedicated slots. When load jobs are assigned to a reservation, they lose access to the free pool. For more information, see Assignments.Once your data is loaded into BigQuery, it is subject to BigQuery storage pricing. If you load data from Cloud Storage, you are charged for storing the data in Cloud Storage. For details, see Data storage on the Cloud Storage pricing page.Data extraction pricingBigQuery offers the following modes of data extraction:Batch export. Use an an extract job to export table data to Cloud Storage. There is no processing charge for exporting data from a BigQuery table using an extract job. Cross-region extract jobs are billed under General Data Transfer Networking Traffic for Google Cloud Cross Region SKUs.Export query results. Use the EXPORT DATA statement to export query results to Cloud Storage, Bigtable, or Spanner. You are billed for the compute cost to process the query statement.Streaming reads. Use the Storage Read API to perform high-throughput reads of table data. You are billed for the amount of data read.

With on-demand pricing, BigQuery charges for the number of bytes processed (also referred to as bytes read). On-demand pricing is solely based on usage, with a bytes read free tier of 300 TiB per month for each billing account. Bytes scanned as part of reads from temporary tables are free and do not count against the 300TiB free tier. This free bytes read 300 TiB is on the bytes-read component, and does not apply to associated outbound data transfer.Note the following regarding Storage Read API charges:You are charged according to the total amount of data read. The total data read per column is calculated based on the type of data in the column, and the size of the data is calculated based on the column's data type. For a detailed explanation of how data size is calculated, see Data size calculation.You are charged for any data read in a read session even if a ReadRows call fails.If you cancel a ReadRows call before the end of the stream is reached, you are charged for any data read before the cancellation. Your charges can include data that was read but not returned to you before the cancellation of the ReadRows call.As a best practice, use partitioned and clustered tables whenever possible. You can reduce the amount of data read by using a WHERE clause to prune partitions. For more information, see Querying partitioned tables.When using Interconnect, Cloud Interconnect pricing applies instead of BigQuery Storage Read API General Network Usage prices.Data replication pricingBesides copy operations within the same region, BigQuery offers two modes of replicating (copying) data between regions. You can perform a one-time copy operation, or use incremental, ongoing replication. Your options for copying data across regions include the following:Cross-region copy. One time or scheduled copy of table data to between regions or multi-regions, see copy datasets or copy tables. Cross-region copy is billed under General Data Transfer Networking Traffic for Google Cloud Cross Region SKUs.Cross-region replication. Ongoing, incremental replication of a dataset between two or more different regions or multi-regions, see cross-region dataset replication.Cross-region Turbo replication. High performance, ongoing, incremental replication of a dataset between two or more different regions or multi-regions. Available only with managed disaster recovery.Both cross-region replication and cross-region Turbo replication are billed under the BigQuery Network Egress Replication SKUs.Storage for replicated dataReplicated data stored in the destination region or multi-region is charged according to BigQuery storage pricing.Data transfer pricing for replicated dataYou are charged for data transfer for the volume of data replicated.

The default Colab Enterprise runtime consumes compute and disk (both SSD and PD) resources.Billing for these resources is metered as pay-as-you go slots as outlined below. These slots are billed under the BigQuery Standard Edition SKU.Notebooks that use a non-default runtime are billed under Vertex SKUs.The default notebook runtime is a Google-provisioned virtual machine (VM) that can run the code in your notebook (IPYNB file).

BigQuery ML built-in models are trained within BigQuery, such as linear regression, logistic regression, k-means, matrix factorization, PCA, and ARIMA models. The pre trained TimesFM model is also considered a built-in model. BigQuery ML external models are trained utilizing other Google Cloud services, DNN, boosted tree and random forest (which are trained on Vertex AI) and AutoML models (which are trained on the Vertex AI Tables backend). BigQuery ML model training pricing is based on the model type and your usage pattern, as well as your pricing model: editions or on-demand. BigQuery ML prediction and evaluation functions are executed within BigQuery ML for all model types, priced as explained below.BigQuery ML editions pricingBigQuery ML is available in Enterprise and Enterprise Plus Editions for customers who prefer a compute capacity (number of slots) based pricing model over the on-demand (number of bytes processed) model. Customers can use Enterprise or Enterprise Plus reservations to use all features of BigQuery ML. BigQuery ML usage will be included in the BigQuery Editions usage.Reservations to create built-in modelsBigQuery has three job types for reservation assignment: QUERY, PIPELINE, and ML_EXTERNAL. QUERY assignments, which are used for analytical queries, are also used to run CREATE MODEL queries for BigQuery ML built-in models. Built-in model training and analytical queries share the same pool of resources in their assigned reservations, and have the same behavior regarding being preemptible, and using idle slots from other reservations.Reservations to create external modelsBecause external models are trained outside of BigQuery, these workloads are not preemptible. As a result, to ensure other workloads are not impacted, only reservations with ML_EXTERNAL job type assignment can be used for these external jobs. Reservations workload management describes how to create reservations for external model training jobs. The slots usage per job is calculated to maintain the price parity between BigQuery slots and external Google Cloud service costs.Note: You can add a ML_EXTERNAL job type assignment to reservations that you want to use for building BigQuery ML external models. When slots in the reservation are shared by both QUERY/PIPELINE and ML_EXTERNAL jobs, QUERY/PIPELINE jobs can use the slots only when they are available. Thus, it is important to ensure all critical QUERY and PIPELINE jobs run in their own reservations, as ML_EXTERNAL jobs are not preemptible. ML_EXTERNAL jobs cannot use idle slots from other reservations. On the other hand, if slots in this reservation (with ML_EXTERNAL assignment) are available, jobs from other reservations (with ignore_idle_slots=false) can use them.Note: To create an AutoML Tables model, you need approximately 1000 ML_EXTERNAL slots. The number of slots is subject to change based on Vertex AI Tables backend pricing. Meanwhile, the number of external slots used to train other BigQuery ML external models (such as DNN, Boosted Tree, Random Forest etc.) is dynamically determined in order to scale the training job horizontally. More specifically, the Vertex AI training scale tier (Virtual Machine configurations for chief worker, parameter servers and workers) is determined at runtime based on the training data size and model type. The BigQuery ML service then reserves a number of slots equivalent to the total VM price from your ML_EXTERNAL reservations.BigQuery ML on-demand pricing﻿BigQuery ML pricing for on-demand queries depends on the type of operation: model type, model creation, model evaluation, model inspection, or model prediction. For the models that support it, hyperparameter tuning is billed at the same rate as model creation. The cost of the model training associated with hyperparameter tuning is the sum of the cost of all executed trials.Note: Matrix factorization models are only available to editions customers or customers with reservations.BigQuery ML on-demand pricing is as follows:Iowa (us-central1)Johannesburg (africa-south1)Taiwan (asia-east1)Hong Kong (asia-east2)Tokyo (asia-northeast1)Osaka (asia-northeast2)Seoul (asia-northeast3)Mumbai (asia-south1)Delhi (asia-south2)Singapore (asia-southeast1)Jakarta (asia-southeast2)Bangkok (asia-southeast3)Sydney (australia-southeast1)Melbourne (australia-southeast2)Europe (eu)Warsaw (europe-central2)Finland (europe-north1)Stockholm (europe-north2)Madrid (europe-southwest1)Belgium (europe-west1)Berlin (europe-west10)Turin (europe-west12)London (europe-west2)Frankfurt (europe-west3)Netherlands (europe-west4)Zurich (europe-west6)Milan (europe-west8)Paris (europe-west9)Doha (me-central1)Dammam (me-central2)Tel Aviv (me-west1)Montreal (northamerica-northeast1)Toronto (northamerica-northeast2)Mexico (northamerica-south1)Sao Paulo (southamerica-east1)Santiago (southamerica-west1)US (us)Iowa (us-central1)South Carolina (us-east1)Northern Virginia (us-east4)Columbus (us-east5)Alabama (us-east7)Dallas (us-south1)Oregon (us-west1)Los Angeles (us-west2)Salt Lake City (us-west3)Las Vegas (us-west4)Phoenix (us-west8)OperationPricingDetailsLogistic regression model creation1Linear regression model creation1K-means clustering model creation1PCA model creationTime series model creation1,2﻿Contribution analysis model creation$312.50 / 1 tebibyte, per 1 month / accountAn additional label is added to the billing record to distinguish between BigQuery ML model creation and regular BigQuery costs.The key is bigquery.googleapis.com/bqml, and the value can be one of the following:bqml_linear_reg_trainingbqml_logistic_reg_trainingbqml_kmeans_trainingbqml_pca_trainingbqml_matrix_factorization_trainingbqml_arima_plus_trainingbqml_arima_plus_xreg_trainingbqml_contribution_analysis_trainingAutoML Tables model creation1DNN model creation1Wide-and-Deep model creation1Boosted tree model creationRandom forest model creationAutoencoder model creation1$6.25 / 1 tebibyte, per 1 month / accountThe total cost of a job is the sum of the following two costs:BigQuery data processing cost (for preprocessing)Passthrough Vertex AI cost (for training)The cost is converted to BigQuery ML bytes processed, and two billing records with different labels are reported for the job:For BigQuery cost, the key is bigquery.googleapis.com/bqml and the value is bqml_analytic.

This applies to both on-demand and editions pricing.2For time series models, when auto-arima is enabled for automatic hyper-parameter tuning, multiple candidate models are fitted and evaluated during the training phase. In this case, the number of bytes processed by the input SELECT statement is multiplied by the number of candidate models, which can be controlled by the AUTO_ARIMA_MAX_ORDER training option for ARIMA_PLUS or the AUTO_ARIMA_MAX_ORDER training option for ARIMA_PLUS_XREG. This applies to both on-demand and editions pricing. The following notes apply to time series model creation:For single time series forecasting with auto-arima enabled, when AUTO_ARIMA_MAX_ORDER is (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), the number of candidate models is (6, 12, 20, 30, 42) respectively if non-seasonal d equals one; otherwise, the number of candidate models is (3, 6, 10, 15, 21).For multiple time series forecasting using TIME_SERIES_ID_COL, the charge is for (6, 12, 20, 30, 42) candidate models when AUTO_ARIMA_MAX_ORDER is (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) respectively.Note that this model selection only applies to model creation. For model evaluation, inspection, and prediction, only the selected model is used, with regular query pricing.3See BigQuery ML Remote Model Inference for details.BigQuery ML remote model training, inference, and tuningBigQuery ML lets customers create a remote model that targets a Vertex AI foundation model, a Vertex AI online prediction endpoint, or a Cloud AI API, for example Cloud AI Vision API.The pricing for BigQuery ML remote model inference has the following parts:The bytes processed by BigQuery are billed according to standard pricing such as on-demand or editions pricing.In addition, costs are incurred for the remote endpoint as follows:Remote Model typesInference functionsPricingGoogle models hosted on Vertex AIML.GENERATE_TEXTML.GENERATE_EMBEDDINGGenerative AI on Vertex AI batch pricing.Anthropic Claude models enabled on Vertex AIML.GENERATE_TEXTGenerative AI on Vertex AI pricingOpen models deployed to Vertex AIML.GENERATE_TEXTVertex AI pricingVertex AI endpointsML.PREDICTVertex AI pricingCloud Natural Language APIML.UNDERSTAND_TEXTCloud Natural Language API pricingCloud Translation APIML.TRANSLATE﻿Cloud Translation API pricingCloud Vision APIML.ANNOTATE_IMAGECloud Vision API pricingDocument AI APIML.PROCESS_DOCUMENTDocument AI API pricingSpeech-to-Text APIML.TRANSCRIBESpeech-to-Text API pricingFor remote endpoint model pricing, you are billed directly by the above services.

These charges are billed from BigQuery to your project.The GPU or TPU usage to tune the LLM. These charges are billed from Vertex AI to your project. For more information, see Vertex AI pricing.BigQuery ML dry run﻿Due to the nature of the underlying algorithms of some model types and differences in billing, the bytes processed will not be calculated for some model types until after training is completed due to the complexity of calculating the initial estimate.BigQuery ML pricing example﻿BigQuery ML charges are not itemized separately on your billing statement. For current models, if you have BigQuery Editions, BigQuery ML charges are included.If you are using on-demand pricing, BigQuery ML charges are included in the BigQuery analysis (query) charges.BigQuery ML jobs that perform inspection, evaluation, and prediction operations incur the same charges as on-demand query jobs. Because CREATE MODEL queries incur different charges, you must calculate CREATE MODEL job costs independently by using the Cloud logging audit logs. Using the audit logs, you can determine the bytes billed by the BigQuery ML service for each BigQuery ML CREATE MODEL job. Then, multiply the bytes billed by the appropriate cost for CREATE MODEL queries in your regional or multi-regional location.For example, to determine the cost of a query job in the US that includes a BigQuery ML CREATE MODEL statement:Open the Cloud Logging page in the Google Cloud console.Verify that the product is set to BigQuery.Click the drop-down arrow in the "Filter by label or text search" box and choose Convert to advanced filter.

In this example, the CREATE MODEL job processed 100873011200 bytes. To calculate the cost of this job in the US multi-regional location, divide the billed bytes by the number of bytes per TiB, and multiply it by the model creation cost:100873011200 / 1099511627776 x $312.5 = $28.669Note: Currently, Cloud logging metrics are not available for BigQuery ML. When available, Cloud logging metrics will allow you to view BigQuery ML bytes billed in graphs with custom aggregations.BI Engine pricingBI Engine accelerates SQL queries by caching BigQuery data in memory. The amount of data stored is constrained by the amount of capacity you purchase. To purchase BI Engine capacity, create a BI Engine reservation in the project where queries will be run.When BI Engine accelerates a query, the query stage that reads table data is free. Subsequent stages depend on the type of BigQuery pricing you're using:For on-demand pricing, stages that use BI Engine are charged for 0 scanned bytes. Subsequent stages will not incur additional on-demand charges.For editions pricing, the first stage consumes no BigQuery reservation slots. Subsequent stages use slots from the BigQuery reservation.BI Engine pricing is as follows:Iowa (us-central1)Johannesburg (africa-south1)Taiwan (asia-east1)Hong Kong (asia-east2)Tokyo (asia-northeast1)Osaka (asia-northeast2)Seoul (asia-northeast3)Mumbai (asia-south1)Delhi (asia-south2)Singapore (asia-southeast1)Jakarta (asia-southeast2)Bangkok (asia-southeast3)Sydney (australia-southeast1)Melbourne (australia-southeast2)Europe (eu)Warsaw (europe-central2)Finland (europe-north1)Stockholm (europe-north2)Madrid (europe-southwest1)Belgium (europe-west1)Berlin (europe-west10)Turin (europe-west12)London (europe-west2)Frankfurt (europe-west3)Netherlands (europe-west4)Galaxy Frankfurt (europe-west5)Zurich (europe-west6)Milan (europe-west8)Paris (europe-west9)Doha (me-central1)Dammam (me-central2)Tel Aviv (me-west1)Montreal (northamerica-northeast1)Toronto (northamerica-northeast2)Mexico (northamerica-south1)Sao Paulo (southamerica-east1)Santiago (southamerica-west1)Iowa (us-central1)Oklahoma (us-central2)South Carolina (us-east1)Northern Virginia (us-east4)Columbus (us-east5)Alabama (us-east7)Dallas (us-south1)Oregon (us-west1)Los Angeles (us-west2)Salt Lake City (us-west3)Las Vegas (us-west4)Phoenix (us-west8)HourlyHourlyMonthlyMonthlyResourcePricingDetailsMemory capacity$0.0416 / 1 gibibyte hourYou are charged per GiB/hour for each project in which you have reserved capacity.If you pay in a currency other than USD, the prices listed in your currency on Cloud Platform SKUs apply.Editions commitment bundleWhen you are using BigQuery capacity compute pricing with BigQuery editions commitments, you are eligible to receive a limited amount of BI Engine capacity as part of your editions price, at no extra cost, as shown in the following chart. To receive BI Engine capacity at no additional cost, follow the instructions to reserve capacity in a project within the same organization as your editions reservation. To ensure a particular project’s BI Engine reservation is discounted toward this bundled capacity, there should be some slots assigned to the project. BI Engine reservation in an 'on-demand analysis' project will not be counted towards the free capacity. Free capacity is shown in your Billing Reports as a normal cost, but it is discounted as a "Spending-Based Discount".Number of slots purchasedNo-cost, additional BI Engine capacity (GiB)1005500251000501500752000100 (maximum per organization)Free operationsThe following BigQuery operations are free of charge in every location. Quotas and limits apply to these operations.If you are copying tables across regions, you are charged for data replication.OperationDetailsBatch load dataYou are not charged for batch loading data using the shared slot pool. You can also create a reservation using editions pricing for guaranteed capacity. Once the data is loaded into BigQuery, you are charged for storage. For details, see Batch loading data.Copy dataYou are not charged for copying a table, but you do incur charges for storing the new table. For more information, see Copying an existing table.Export dataYou are not charged for exporting data using the shared slot pool, but you do incur charges for storing the data in Cloud Storage. You can also create a reservation using editions pricing for guaranteed capacity. When you use the EXPORT DATA SQL statement, you are charged for query processing. For details, see Exporting data.Delete operationsYou are not charged for deleting datasets or tables, deleting individual table partitions, deleting views, or deleting user-defined functions.Free usage tierAs part of the Google Cloud Free Tier, BigQuery offers some resources free of charge up to a specific limit. These free usage limits are available during and after the free trial period. If you go over these usage limits and are no longer in the free trial period, you will be charged according to the pricing on this page. You can try BigQuery's free tier in the BigQuery sandbox without a credit card.ResourceMonthly free usage limitsDetailsStorageThe first 10 GiB per month is free.BigQuery ML models and training data stored in BigQuery are included in the BigQuery storage free tier.Queries (analysis)The first 1 TiB of query data processed per month is free.BigQuery Editions pricing is also available for high-volume customers that prefer a stable, monthly cost.Flat-rate pricingNote: The BigQuery flat-rate pricing model is no longer offered as of July 5, 2023. It is described here for customers who have existing flat-rate commitmentsFlat-rate compute pricingWhen you use the flat-rate compute pricing model, you purchase dedicated query processing capacity, measured in BigQuery slots. Your queries consume this capacity, and you are not billed for bytes processed. If your capacity demands exceed your committed capacity, BigQuery will queue up queries, and you will not be charged additional fees.Flat-rate compute pricing:Applies to query costs, including BigQuery ML, DML, and DDL statements.Does not apply to storage costs or BI Engine costs.Does not apply to streaming inserts and using the BigQuery Storage API.Is purchased as a regional resource. Slot commitments purchased in one region or multi-region cannot be used in another region or multi-region and cannot be moved.Is available in per-second (flex), monthly, and annual commitments.Can be shared across your entire organization.
