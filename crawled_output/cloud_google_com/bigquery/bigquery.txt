BigQuery supports all data types, works across clouds, and has built-in machine learning and business intelligence, all within a unified platform. With native Vertex AI integration, you can easily connect your data to Google's industry leading AI without leaving BigQuery.What is an enterprise data warehouse?An enterprise data warehouse is a system used for the analysis and reporting of structured and semi-structured data from multiple sources. Many organizations are moving from traditional data warehouses that are on-premises to cloud data warehouses, which provide more cost savings, scalability, and flexibility.How secure is BigQuery?BigQuery offers robust security, governance, and reliability controls that offer high availability and a 99.99% uptime SLA. Your data is protected with encryption by default and customer-managed encryption keys.How can I get started with BigQuery?There are a few ways to get started with BigQuery. New customers get $300 in free credits to spend on BigQuery. All customers get 10 GB storage and up to 1 TB queries free per month, not charged against their credits. You can get these credits by signing up for the BigQuery free trial. Not ready yet? You can use the BigQuery sandbox without a credit card to see how it works. What is the BigQuery sandbox?The BigQuery sandbox lets you try out BigQuery without a credit card. You stay within BigQuery’s free tier automatically, and you can use the sandbox to run queries and analysis on public datasets to see how it works. You can also bring your own data into the BigQuery sandbox for analysis. There is an option to update to the free trial where new customers get a $300 credit to try BigQuery.What are the most common ways companies use BigQuery?Companies of all sizes use BigQuery to consolidate siloed data into one location so you can perform data analysis and get insights from all of your business data. This allows companies to make decisions in real time, streamline business reporting, and incorporate machine learning into data analysis to predict future business opportunities.Other inquiries and
