It enhances the security of development environments while accelerating developer onboarding and productivity, including a native integration with Gemini for Google Cloud.Go to consoleAccess secure and fast development environments anytime using browser or local IDEEnable administrators to easily provision, scale, manage, and secure development environmentsCustomize development environments with your preferred IDE and through custom container imagesBuild applications faster with AI-powered assistance from Gemini Code AssistVideo52:10BenefitsEnhance security of your development environmentsExtend your security posture to your IDEs with centrally managed, yet configurable, security mechanisms based on industry best practices. Mitigate exfiltration by preventing the storage of source code locally.Increase developer productivity with custom toolsImprove developer productivity with secure and fast development environments accessible using browser or local IDE, while supporting multiple popular IDEs, customizable developer tools, and Gemini Code Assist. Simplify onboarding for new and remote developersOnboard your developers faster no matter where they are located, with managed cloud-based development environments, while ensuring replicability and consistency using container-defined environments.Key featuresKey featuresRun code in your real environment, inside your VPCCloud Workstations can run inside your VPC, allowing you to develop and run code inside your private network and in your staging environment, so you don’t need to emulate your services. You can also enforce “no source code on local devices” policies and bring the same security mechanisms used for production workloads to your development environments, such as VPC Service Controls (VPC SC), private ingress/egress, Cloud Audit Logs, and granular IAM controls.Multi-IDE supportCloud Workstations supports any code editors and applications that can be run in a container. IDEs can also be personalized and support extensions. Enjoy the benefits of remote development without needing to change your IDE or workflow using our managed IDEs such as Code OSS for Cloud Workstations, or multiple JetBrains IDEs such as IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, Rider, and CLion through JetBrains Gateway, as well as Posit Workbench (with RStudio Pro).Dev environments ready to go in minutesQuickly onboard developers using the Google Cloud console, and use shared workstation configurations to enable consistent development environment definitions, which can be easily updated and synchronized across all developers with a single action. Developers can create and start a workstation in minutes, where the workstation configuration will be automatically applied, addressing “works on my machine” and configuration drift problems.Consistent environments across teamsCloud Workstations provides a managed experience using predefined or custom containers to specify your environment configuration, such as pre-installed tools, libraries, IDE extensions, preloaded files, and start-up scripts. You can also ensure all developers get the latest versions and patches when they start working by setting a session limit and simply updating your container images. Cloud Workstations will then handle ensuring that they are all updated according to the container image you specified.Built-in Gemini Code Assist integrationsCloud Workstations supports Gemini Code Assist, which provides AI-powered assistance to developers, such as auto code completion, code generation, and chat. Developers can leverage these Gemini Code Assist capabilities directly in Cloud Workstations to build applications faster and more efficiently.View all featuresLearn more about Cloud Workstations, its benefits and use cases.7:38CustomersCheck out the stories from our customersBlog postL’Oreal uses Cloud Workstations to increase its developer productivity and security5-min readVideoCommerzbank chose Cloud Workstations to protect its development environmentsVideo (17:49)Blog postHow DZ BANK improved developer productivity5-min readSee all customersCloud Workstations removes the technical barriers by providing a powerful and scalable solution for all the developers we have across the world.Sebastian Moran, Head of Data Engineering, L’OréalCheck out the storyWhat's newWhat’s newSign up for Google Cloud newsletters to receive product updates, event information, special offers, and more.VideoIncrease developer productivity and security with cloud-based developmentWatch videoEventTwitter Space: Increase developer velocity with cloud-based app developmentLearn moreVideoHow to accelerate developer velocity with Cloud WorkstationsWatch videoVideoManaged and secure development environment on Google CloudWatch videoBlog postRemote Development in JetBrains IDEs now available in Google Cloud Workstations Learn moreDocumentationCloud Workstations quickstart, guides, and moreGoogle Cloud BasicsCreate a workstationLearn how to create your first workstation in Cloud Workstations. Learn moreArchitectureCloud Workstations architectureLearn about the architecture and resources used by Cloud Workstations.Learn moreGoogle Cloud BasicsBase editor overviewLearn about the Cloud Workstations base editor, its components, and helpful features. Learn moreGoogle Cloud BasicsDevelop remotely with JetBrains IDEsLearn about the plugin for JetBrains Gateway, which lets you develop with JetBrains IDEs, such as IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, Rider, CLion, PhpStorm, and WebStorm.Learn moreGoogle Cloud BasicsConfigure private clustersLearn how private clusters work and how to set them up in Cloud Workstations using Private Service Connect and VPC Service Controls. Learn moreTutorialCode with Gemini Code Assist Check this tutorial on how to create an application with Gemini Code Assist in Cloud Workstations.Learn moreNot seeing what you’re looking for?View all product documentationExplore more docsGet a quick intro to using this product.Learn to complete specific tasks with this product.Browse guides and tutorials for this product.View APIs, references, and other resources for this product.Release notesRead about the latest releases for Cloud WorkstationsGenerate a solutionWhat problem are you trying to solve?Generate solutionshuffleSurprise meWhat you'll get:check_smallStep-by-step guidecheck_smallReference architecturecheck_smallAvailable pre-built solutionsThis service was built with Vertex AI.
