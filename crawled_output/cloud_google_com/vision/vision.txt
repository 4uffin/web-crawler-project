Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers and systems to interpret and analyze visual data and derive meaningful information from digital images, videos, and other visual inputs. Some of its typical real-world applications include: object detection, visual content (images, documents, videos) processing, understanding and analysis, product search, image classification and search, and content moderation.Advanced multimodal gen AIGoogle Cloud's Vertex AI offers access to Gemini, a family of cutting-edge, multimodal model that is capable of understanding virtually any input, combining different types of information, and generating almost any output. While Gemini is best suited for tasks that mix visuals, text, and code, Gemini Pro Vision excels at a wide variety of vision related tasks, such as object recognition, digital content understanding, and captioning/description. It can be accessed through an API.Vision focused gen AIImagen on Vertex AI brings Google's state-of-the-art image generative AI capabilities to application developers via an API. Some of its key features include image generation (restricted GA) with text prompts, image editing (restricted GA) with text prompts, describing an image in text (also known as visual captioning, GA), and subject model fine-tuning (restricted GA). Learn more about its key features and launch stages.Ready-to-use Vision AIPowered by Google’s pretrained computer vision ML models, Cloud Vision API is a readily available API (REST and RPC) that allows developers to easily integrate common vision detection features within applications, including image labeling, face and landmark detection, optical character recognition (OCR), and tagging of explicit content. Each feature you apply to an image is a billable unit—Cloud Vision API lets you use 1,000 units of its features for free every month. See pricing details.Document understanding gen AIDocument AI is a document understanding platform that combines computer vision and other technologies such as natural language processing to extract text and data from scanned documents, transforming unstructured data into structured information and business insights. It offers a wide range of pretrained processors optimized for different types of documents. It also makes it easy to build custom processors to classify, split, and extract structured data from documents via Document AI Workbench.Intro to Document AI4:37Ready-to-use Vision AI for videosWith computer vision technology at its core, Video Intelligence API is an easy way to process, analyze, and understand video content. Its pretrained ML models automatically recognize a vast number of objects, places, and actions in stored and streaming video, with exceptional quality. It’s highly efficient for common use cases such as content moderation and recommendation, media archives, and contextual advertisements. You can also train custom ML models with Vertex AI Vision for your specific needs. Demo: How to use Video Intelligence API to create a searchable video archive6:21Visual Inspection AIVisual Inspection AI automates visual inspection tasks in manufacturing and other industrial settings. It leverages advanced computer vision and deep learning techniques to analyze images and videos, identify anomalies, detect and locate defects, and check missing and defect parts in assembled products.You can train custom models with no technical expertise and minimum labeled images, efficiently run inference at production lines, and continuously refresh models with fresh data from the factory floor.Demo - How does Visual Inspection AI work?5:15Unified Vision AI PlatformVertex AI Vision is a fully managed application development environment that lets developers easily build, deploy, and manage computer vision applications to process a variety of data modalities, such as text, image, video, and tabular data. It reduces time to build from days to minutes at one tenth the cost of current offerings.You can build and deploy your own custom models, and manage and scale them with CI/CD pipelines. It also integrates with popular open source tools like TensorFlow and PyTorch.Demo - How Vertex AI Vision works58:59Data privacy and securityGoogle Cloud has industry-leading capabilities that give you—our customers—control over your data and provide visibility into when and how your data is accessed.As a Google Cloud customer, you own your customer data.
