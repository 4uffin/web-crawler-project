Maintain workload continuity during planned and unplanned events with live migration. When a VM goes down, Compute Engine performs a live migration to another host in the same zone.Automations and recommendations for resource efficiencyAutomatically add VMs to handle peak load and replace underperforming instances with managed instance groups. Manually adjust your resources using historical data with rightsizing recommendations, or guarantee capacity for planned demand spikes with future reservations.All of our latest compute instances (including C4A, C4, C4D, N4, C3D, X4, and Z3) run on Titanium, a system of purpose-built microcontrollers and tiered scale-out offloads to improve your infrastructure performance, life cycle management, and security.Transparent pricing and discountingReview detailed pricing guidance for any VM type or configuration, or use our pricing calculator to get a personalized estimate.To save on batch jobs and fault-tolerant workloads, use Spot VMs to reduce your bill from 60-91%.Receive automatic discounts for sustained use, or up to 70% off when you sign up for committed use discounts.Security controls and configurationsEncrypt data-in-use and while it’s being processed with Confidential VMs. Defend against rootkits and bootkits with Shielded VMs.Meet stringent compliance standards for data residency, sovereignty, access, and encryption with Assured Workloads.Workload ManagerNow available for SAP workloads, Workload Manager evaluates your application workloads by detecting deviations from documented standards and best practices to proactively prevent issues, continuously analyze workloads, and simplify system troubleshooting.VM ManagerVM Manager is a suite of tools that can be used to manage operating systems for large virtual machine (VM) fleets running Windows and Linux on Compute Engine.Sole-tenant nodesSole-tenant nodes are physical Compute Engine servers dedicated exclusively for your use. Sole-tenant nodes simplify deployment for bring-your-own-license (BYOL) applications. Sole-tenant nodes give you access to the same machine types and VM configuration options as regular compute instances.TPU acceleratorsCloud TPUs can be added to accelerate machine learning and artificial intelligence applications. Cloud TPUs can be reserved, used on-demand, or available as preemptible VMs.Linux and Windows supportRun your choice of OS, including Debian, CentOS Stream, Fedora CoreOS, SUSE, Ubuntu, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, FreeBSD, or Windows Server 2008 R2, 2012 R2, and 2016. You can also use a shared image from the Google Cloud community or bring your own.Container supportRun, manage, and orchestrate Docker containers on Compute Engine VMs with Google Kubernetes Engine.Placement policyUse placement policy to specify the location of your underlying hardware instances. Spread placement policy provides higher reliability by placing instances on distinct hardware, reducing the impact of underlying hardware failures. Compact placement policy provides lower latency between nodes by placing instances close together within the same network infrastructure. View all featuresChoose the right VM for your workload and requirementsOptimizationWorkloadsOur recommendationEfficientLowest cost per core.Web and app servers (low traffic)Dev and test environmentsContainerized microservicesVirtual desktopsGeneral purpose E-SeriesE2FlexibleBest price-performance for balanced and flexible workloads. Web and app servers (low to medium traffic)Containerized microservicesVirtual desktopsBack-office, CRM, or BI applicationsData pipelinesDatabases (small to medium sized)General purpose N-SeriesN4, N2, N2D, and N1PerformanceBest performance with advanced capabilities.Web and app servers (high traffic)Ad serversGame serversData analyticsDatabases (any size)In-memory cachesMedia streaming and transcodingCPU-based AI/MLGeneral purpose C-SeriesC4A, C4, C3, C3D, C4DComputeHighest compute per core.Web and app servers Game serversMedia streaming and transcoding Compute-bound workloads High performance computing (HPC)CPU-based AI/MLSpecialized H-SeriesH3, H4D (preview)MemoryHighest memory per core.Databases (large)In-memory cachesElectronic design automationModeling and simulationSpecialized M-Series X4, M3, M4 (preview)Storage﻿Highest storage per core.Data analyticsDatabases (large horizontal scale-out, flash-optimized, data warehouses, and more)HypervisorsSpecialized Z-SeriesZ3, Z3H Bare Metal (preview)Training, inference, and HPC with GPUs and TPUsHighest performing accelerators.AI model training and fine-tuning including large language models (LLM), Mixture of Experts (MoE), deep learning, computer visionHigh-performance AI inference including real-time LLM, generative AI, recommendation systems, conversational AI, natural language processing (NLP)HPC including climate modeling, molecular dynamics (drug discovery), and scientific visualizationSpecialized A-seriesA4, A3Custom-designed TPUsV6e, v5pGraphics and inference with GPUsBalanced performance and efficiency GPUs.AI inference including computer vision, BERT NLPVideo streaming and analyticsVideo encoding, decoding, and transcodingGraphics rendering and visualizationVirtual workstationsSpecialized G-seriesG4, G2Documentation: Machine families resource and comparison guideEfficientLowest cost per core.WorkloadsWeb and app servers (low traffic)Dev and test environmentsContainerized microservicesVirtual desktopsOur recommendationGeneral purpose E-SeriesE2FlexibleBest price-performance for balanced and flexible workloads. WorkloadsWeb and app servers (low to medium traffic)Containerized microservicesVirtual desktopsBack-office, CRM, or BI applicationsData pipelinesDatabases (small to medium sized)Our recommendationGeneral purpose N-SeriesN4, N2, N2D, and N1PerformanceBest performance with advanced capabilities.WorkloadsWeb and app servers (high traffic)Ad serversGame serversData analyticsDatabases (any size)In-memory cachesMedia streaming and transcodingCPU-based AI/MLOur recommendationGeneral purpose C-SeriesC4A, C4, C3, C3D, C4DComputeHighest compute per core.WorkloadsWeb and app servers Game serversMedia streaming and transcoding Compute-bound workloads High performance computing (HPC)CPU-based AI/MLOur recommendationSpecialized H-SeriesH3, H4D (preview)MemoryHighest memory per core.WorkloadsDatabases (large)In-memory cachesElectronic design automationModeling and simulationOur recommendationSpecialized M-Series X4, M3, M4 (preview)Storage﻿Highest storage per core.WorkloadsData analyticsDatabases (large horizontal scale-out, flash-optimized, data warehouses, and more)HypervisorsOur recommendationSpecialized Z-SeriesZ3, Z3H Bare Metal (preview)Training, inference, and HPC with GPUs and TPUsHighest performing accelerators.WorkloadsAI model training and fine-tuning including large language models (LLM), Mixture of Experts (MoE), deep learning, computer visionHigh-performance AI inference including real-time LLM, generative AI, recommendation systems, conversational AI, natural language processing (NLP)HPC including climate modeling, molecular dynamics (drug discovery), and scientific visualizationOur recommendationSpecialized A-seriesA4, A3Custom-designed TPUsV6e, v5pGraphics and inference with GPUsBalanced performance and efficiency GPUs.WorkloadsAI inference including computer vision, BERT NLPVideo streaming and analyticsVideo encoding, decoding, and transcodingGraphics rendering and visualizationVirtual workstationsOur recommendationSpecialized G-seriesG4, G2Documentation: Machine families resource and comparison guideHow It WorksCompute Engine is a computing and hosting service that lets you create and run virtual machines on Google infrastructure, comparable to Amazon EC2 and Azure Virtual Machines.

What can it do?Compute Engine is an Infrastructure-as-a-Service product offering flexible, self-managed virtual machines (VMs) hosted on Google's infrastructure. Compute Engine includes Linux and Windows-based VMs running on KVM, local and durable storage options, and a simple REST-based API for configuration and control. The service integrates with Google Cloud technologies, such as Cloud Storage, App Engine, and BigQuery to extend beyond the basic computational capability to create more complex and sophisticated apps.What is a virtual CPU in Compute Engine?On Compute Engine, each virtual CPU (vCPU) is implemented as a single hardware hyper-thread on one of the available CPU Platforms. On Intel Xeon processors, Intel Hyper-Threading Technology allows multiple application threads to run on each physical processor core. You configure your Compute Engine VMs with one or more of these hyper-threads as vCPUs. The machine type specifies the number of vCPUs that your instance has.How do App Engine and Compute Engine relate to each other?We see the two as being complementary. App Engine is Google's Platform-as-a-Service offering and Compute Engine is Google's Infrastructure-as-a-Service offering. App Engine is great for running web-based apps, line of business apps, and mobile backends. Compute Engine is great for when you need more control of the underlying infrastructure. For example, you might use Compute Engine when you have highly customized business logic or you want to run your own storage system.How do I get started?Try these getting started guides, or try one of our quickstart tutorials.How does pricing and purchasing work?Compute Engine charges based on compute instance, storage, and network use. VMs are charged on a per-second basis with a one minute minimum. Storage cost is calculated based on the amount of data you store. Network cost is calculated based on the amount of data transferred between VMs that communicate with each other and with the internet. For more information, review our price sheet.Do you offer paid support?Yes, we offer paid support for enterprise customers. For more information, contact our sales organization.Do you offer a Service Level Agreement (SLA)?Yes, we offer a Compute Engine SLA.Where can I send feedback?For billing-related questions, you can send questions to the appropriate support channel.For feature requests and bug reports, submit an issue to our issues tracker.How can I create a project?Go to the Google Cloud console. When prompted, select an existing project or create a new project.Follow the prompts to set up billing. If you are new to Google Cloud, you have free trial credit to pay for your instances.What is the difference between a project number and a project ID?Every project can be identified in two ways: the project number or the project ID. The project number is automatically created when you create the project, whereas the project ID is created by you, or whoever created the project. The project ID is optional for many services, but is required by Compute Engine. For more information, see Google Cloud console projects.What steps does Google take to protect my data?See disk encryption.How do I choose the right size for my persistent disk?Persistent disk performance scales with the size of the persistent disk. Use the persistent disk performance chart to help decide what size disk works for you. If you're not sure, read the documentation to decide how big to make your persistent disk.Where can I request more quota for my project?By default, all Compute Engine projects have default quotas for various resource types. However, these default quotas can be increased on a per-project basis. Check your quota limits and usage in the quota page on the Google Cloud console. If you reach the limit for your resources and need more quota, make a request to increase the quota for certain resources using the IAM quotas page. You can make a request using the Edit Quotas button on the top of the page.What kind of machine configuration (memory, RAM, CPU) can I choose for my instance?Compute Engine offers several configurations for your instance. You can also create custom configurations that match your exact instance needs. See the full list of available options on the machine types page.If I accidentally delete my instance, can I retrieve it?No, instances that have been deleted cannot be retrieved. However, if an instance is simply stopped, you can start it again.Do I have the option of using a regional data center in selected countries?Yes, Compute Engine offers data centers around the world. These data center options are designed to provide low latency connectivity options from those regions. For specific region information, including the geographic location of regions, see regions and zones.How can I tell if a zone is offline?The Compute Engine Zones section in the Google Cloud console shows the status of each zone. You can also get the status of zones through the command-line tool by running gcloud compute zones list, or through the Compute Engine API with the compute.zones.list method.What operating systems can my instances run on?Compute Engine supports several operating system images and third-party images. Additionally, you can create a customized version of an image or build your own image.What are the available zones I can create my instance in?For a list of available regions and zones, see regions and zones.What if my question wasn’t answered here?Take a look at a longer list of FAQs here.More ways to get your questions answeredAll Compute FAQsAsk us a
