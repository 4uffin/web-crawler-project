This makes latency-sensitive workloads like personalization a perfect fit for Bigtable. Distributed counters and high read and write throughput per dollar makes it also a great fit for clickstream and IoT use cases, and even batch analytics for high-performance computing (HPC) applications, including training ML models.How Segment drives real-time personalization with Bigtable41:18Write and read scalability with no limitsBigtable decouples compute resources from data storage, which makes it possible to transparently adjust processing resources. Each additional node can process reads and writes equally well, providing effortless horizontal scalability. Bigtable optimizes performance by automatically scaling resources to adapt to server traffic, handling the sharding, replication, and query processing.SQL and continuous materialized viewsBigtable SQL empowers users to build fully-managed, real-time applications using familiar SQL syntax, with specialized features that preserve Bigtable's flexible schema. You can also use the SQL interface to build incremental materialized views that simplify the creation of real-time metrics. A Bigtable materialized view will automatically keep data up to date by processing the changes as they arrive without impacting your write and read performance and scales automatically in response to the traffic. Data model flexibilityBigtable lets your data model evolve organically. Store anything from scalars, JSON, Protocol Buffers, Avro, Arrow to embeddings, images, and dynamically add/remove new columns as needed. Deliver low-latency serving or high-performance batch analytics over raw, unstructured data in a single database.Solana stores the world's largest blockchain ledger on Bigtable1:22Easy migration from NoSQL databasesBigtable offers Apache Cassandra and HBase APIs and migration tooling that enables faster and simpler onboarding by ensuring accurate data migration with reduced effort. HBase Bigtable replication library and Cassandra Proxy allow for no-downtime live migrations while Bigtable Data Bridge simplifies migrations from Amazon DynamoDB.Zero-downtime HBase to Bigtable migrations12:42From a single zone up to eight regions at onceApps backed by Bigtable can deliver low-latency reads and writes with globally distributed multi-primary configurations, no matter where your users may be. Zonal instances are great for cost savings and can be seamlessly scaled up to multi-region deployments with automatic replication. When running a multi-region instance, your database is protected against a regional failure and offers industry-leading 99.999% availability.High-performance, workload-isolated data processingBigtable Data Boost enables users to run analytical queries, batch ETL processes, train ML models, or export data faster without affecting transactional workloads. Data Boost does not require capacity planning or management. It allows directly querying data stored in Google’s distributed storage system, Colossus using on-demand capacity letting users easily handle mixed workloads and share data worry-free.Rich application and tool supportEasily connect to the open source ecosystem with the Apache HBase API. Build data-driven applications faster with seamless integrations with Apache Spark, Hadoop, GKE, Dataflow, Dataproc, Vertex AI Vector Search, and BigQuery. Meet development teams where they are with SQL and client libraries for Java, Go, Python, C#, Node.js, PHP, Ruby, C++, HBase, and integration with LangChain.No hidden costsNo IOPS charges, no cost for taking or restoring backups, no disproportionate read/write pricing to impact your budget as your workloads evolve.Real-time change data capture and eventingUse Bigtable change streams to capture change data from Bigtable databases and integrate it with other systems for analytics, event triggering, and compliance.

Go to the partner directory.FAQExpand allWhat type of database is Bigtable?Bigtable is a NoSQL database service, specifically a key-value store that allows for very wide tables with tens of thousands of columns, hence also referred to as a wide-column database or a distributed multi-dimensional map. Bigtable is a NoSQL database in the "Not only SQL" sense, rather than "zero SQL." It supports many capabilities beyond key-value lookups including aggregations and global secondary indexes.Bigtable is most similar to popular open source projects it inspired, such as Apache HBase and Cassandra, and hence is the most common destination for customers that deal with large data volumes looking for a high-performance, cost-effective, fully managed NoSQL database solution on Google Cloud.Does Bigtable support SQL?In addition to its key-value APIs, Bigtable also supports SQL queries in three different ways:For low-latency application development, Bigtable offers a SQL query API that builds upon GoogleSQL with extensions for the wide-column data model resembling Cassandra Query Language (CQL). It supports 100+ functions including aggregations (GROUP BY), JSON processing functions and vector search (kNN).For data science use cases or other kinds of batch processing and ETL, Bigtable supports SparkSQL using its Spark client.For users who want to do post-hoc exploratory analysis or blend data from multiple sources for batch analytics, Bigtable data can also be accessed from BigQuery. Simply register your Bigtable tables in BigQuery and query like any other BigQuery table without any ETL or data duplication.How do I migrate databases to Bigtable?Bigtable offers Apache Cassandra and HBase APIs and migration tooling that enables faster and simpler onboarding by ensuring accurate data migration with reduced effort. Bigtable’s HBase replication library and Cassandra migration tools allow for no-downtime, live migrations. Bigtable also offers utilities to simplify migrations from DynamoDB.Is Bigtable serverless?Bigtable storage is billed per GB used similar to a serverless model. Bigtable also offers linear horizontal scaling and can automatically scale up and down compute resources in response to demand fluctuations. Hence it doesn’t require a long term capacity commitment for storage or compute. However, pricing for low-latency compute is capacity-based and billed per node, not per request where each node can serve up to 17K requests per second. This makes Bigtable price more favorable for larger workloads but less ideal for small applications, which may be more suitable for Google Cloud databases such as Firestore.For batch data processing Bigtable offers Data Boost, which bills in Serverless Processing Units (SPU).Learn moreDiscover more user storiesAsk the communitymenuOverviewSolutionsProductsPricingResourcesDocsSupportContact
