Axion processors are the latest innovation in a long line of custom Google silicon, from Tensor Processing Units for AI, to Video Coding Units for YouTube, and Tensor chips for Pixel devices. Each of these significantly improved performance and efficiency for resource-intensive applications used by businesses and consumers everywhere.Cost efficientGet up to 65% better price-performance than other instances available on Google Cloud for a range of general purpose workloads like Java and MySQL. You can also use C4A with Cloud SQL and AlloyDB for PostgreSQL managed databases, now available in Preview, providing significant price-performance advantages for database workloads.Energy efficientGoogle Cloud data centers are 1.5X more efficient than the industry-average. Axion reduces consumption even more, using up to 60% less energy than other CPUs on Google Cloud. Choice and flexibilityGoogle has a long history of leadership in open source. Before we built Axion, we co-created open software and firmware standards that ensure Arm-based applications will run smoothly on any participating cloud, often with zero code changes needed, giving you the flexibility to build and run apps anywhere with a broad partner and open source software support.Google Cloud customers can use Axion in Google Compute Engine, Google Kubernetes Engine, Dataproc, Cloud Batch, Cloud SQL and AlloyDB for PostgreSQL, with more coming soon.Built on TitaniumUnderpinning every Axion instance is Titanium, a system of purpose-built microcontrollers and tiered scale-out offloads to improve your infrastructure performance, life cycle management, and security.View moreInstances powered by Axion processorsGoogle Axion ProcessorWorkloadsShapesC4AWeb and app servers (high traffic)Ad serversGame serversData analyticsDatabases (any size)In-memory cachesMedia streaming and transcodingCPU-based AI/MLNetwork appliancesProcessors for cloud workloadsUp to 72 vCPUs, 576 GB RAM, and 100 Gbps networking.Configurations:Standard: 1:4 vCPU to memoryHigh memory: 1:8 vCPU to memoryHigh CPU: 1:2 vCPU to memoryStandard and High-memory configurations also offer Titanium SSD options with up to 6 TB in local storage capacity.Learn more: Axion documentationC4AWorkloadsWeb and app servers (high traffic)Ad serversGame serversData analyticsDatabases (any size)In-memory cachesMedia streaming and transcodingCPU-based AI/MLNetwork appliancesProcessors for cloud workloadsShapesUp to 72 vCPUs, 576 GB RAM, and 100 Gbps networking.Configurations:Standard: 1:4 vCPU to memoryHigh memory: 1:8 vCPU to memoryHigh CPU: 1:2 vCPU to memoryStandard and High-memory configurations also offer Titanium SSD options with up to 6 TB in local storage capacity.Learn more: Axion documentationHow It WorksLearn about seven possible migration paths from x86 or other Arm-based CPUs to Axion, from Google managed services to containerized workloads, Linux-interpreted languages (Java, Python, PHP, Ruby), and more.Watch the video7 ways to migrate to Arm-based CPUs on Google CloudCommon UsesCreate your first VMHow-tosThree ways to get startedComplete a tutorial.
