Fill out this form to get contactedProduct highlightsGet to know Gemini Code Assist Enterprise0:50FeaturesAI assistance at terminalGemini Code Assist gives you access to Gemini CLI, an open source AI agent that brings the power of Gemini directly into your terminal. Gemini CLI provides powerful AI capabilities, from code understanding and file manipulation to command execution and dynamic troubleshooting, offering a fundamental update to your command line experience. While Gemini CLI provides a generous free tier with high usage limits for individual developers, you can supercharge your experience by using a Gemini Code Assist license. Gemini CLI is currently in Preview.Agents for development tasksGemini Code Assist's agent mode, currently in preview, pairs you with agents capable of performing a wide range of tasks across the software development lifecycle. It expands the capabilities of simple command-response interactions inside chat, with support for multiple file edits, full project context, built-in tools, and integration with ecosystem tools using MCP, all while incorporating Human in the Loop (HiTL) for needed oversight.AI code assistanceGemini Code Assist completes your code as you write, and generates whole code blocks or functions on demand. Code assistance is available in many popular IDEs, such as Visual Studio Code, JetBrains IDEs (IntelliJ, PyCharm, GoLand, WebStorm, and more), Cloud Workstations, Cloud Shell Editor, and supports most programming languages, including Java, JavaScript, Python, C, C++, Go, PHP, and SQL.Natural language chatThrough a natural language chat interface, you can quickly chat with Gemini Code Assist to get answers to your coding questions, or receive guidance on coding best practices. Chat is available in all supported IDEs.Usage metricsMetrics and observability logging along with a dashboard to monitor daily active use, chat exposures, code suggestions, acceptance rates, and lines of code accepted.Measuring the impact of Gemini Code Assist in your businessRead the blogCode customizationCustomize Gemini Code Assist using your organization’s private codebases for more tailored assistance. Your developers can get code suggestions more pertinent to your private codebases.Local codebase awarenessGemini Code Assist generates code that’s more relevant to your application by grounding responses with context from your local codebase and current development session. Perform large-scale changes to your codebase, including adding new features, updating cross-file dependencies, helping with version upgrades, comprehensive code reviews, and more.Code transformationGemini Code Assist comes with contextual smart actions and smart commands, quick shortcuts to automate tasks such as fix code errors, generation, and code explanation. You can also just select your code and use natural language to quickly take action on the code selected. Because these smart actions and commands are available right in the IDE, it minimizes the context switching of copying/pasting, making the user experience much smoother for developers. Additionally Gemini is in your IDE, it has the context of all your files, and can assist you in a more personalized way.API development Using Gemini Code Assist in Apigee, you can create APIs consistent with your enterprise standards without specialized expertise. If an existing API specification in API Hub doesn’t meet your requirements, you can create a new one with just a prompt. Gemini Code Assist considers artifacts such as your security schemas or API objects in API Hub, and uses them to suggest a specification tailored to your enterprise, saving time in review cycles and development. Furthermore, Gemini assists you to easily spin up a mock server for simulating real-world behavior and to build a proxy from your specification. This feature is currently in preview.App development in FirebaseGemini Code Assist provides access to Gemini in Firebase, which is integrated within the Firebase console to help streamline your development process. Chat with Gemini to plan and design your application, generate code, troubleshoot issues, and get recommendations based on best practices. Get insights into your app's crashes with AI assistance in Crashlytics, which provides crash summaries, possible root causes, and suggested fixes.Gemini and Firebase10:59BigQuery data insightsUnlock deeper insights from your data with a library of queries generated from the metadata of your tables.App integration and workflow automationUsing Gemini Code Assist in Application Integration, you can build end-to-end automation flows from prompts or one-click suggestions. Using the prompts and existing enterprise assets like APIs or applications, Gemini Code Assist suggests multiple flows tailored for your use case. Automatically create variables, preconfigure tasks, and complete documentation in accordance with your enterprise context. Get suggested optimizations and extend existing flows in a single click, to significantly reduce your maintenance efforts.Gemini Cloud Assist Gain access to the premium paid features of Gemini Cloud Assist, such as Application Design Center for AI-assisted infrastructure design, and Investigations for AI-assisted troubleshooting and issue resolution. Currently available at no charge during preview.Enterprise security and privacyOur data governance policy helps ensure customer code, customers' inputs, as well as the recommendations generated will not be used to train any shared models nor used to develop any products. Customers control and own their data and IP. Gemini Code Assist also comes with security features like Private Google Access, VPC Service Controls, and Enterprise Access Controls with granular IAM permissions to help enterprises adopt AI assistance at scale without compromising on security and privacy.Respect intellectual property Gemini Code Assist provides source citation so that code suggestions are automatically flagged when directly quoting at length from a source to help enterprises comply with license requirements. Google’s IP indemnification policy helps protect Gemini Code Assist licensed users from potential legal ramifications concerning copyright infringements.Industry certificatesGemini Code Assist has achieved multiple industry certifications such as SOC 1/2/3, ISO/IEC 27001 (Information Security Management), 27017 (Cloud Security), 27018 (Protection of PII), and 27701 (Privacy Information Management). More details are at Certifications and security for Gemini.View all featuresHow It WorksGemini Code Assist uses large language models (LLMs) from Google. The LLMs are fine-tuned with billions of lines of open source code, security data, and Google Cloud documentation and sample code. These models paired with Gemini Code Assist give developers code completion, code generation, natural language chat, and more, in their IDE, and Google Cloud services including Firebase, Colab Enterprise (Vertex AI), Databases BigQuery, Apigee, and Application Integration.Setup guide Learn how to prompt Gemini Code Assist Common UsesCode faster with AI assistanceTutorials, quickstarts, & labsExpedite coding with AI code completion, generation, and chat Application developers can use Gemini Code Assist to auto-complete code inline while coding in IDEs, or generate code blocks using natural language comments.
