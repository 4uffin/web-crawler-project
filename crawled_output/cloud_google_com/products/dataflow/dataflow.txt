Build streaming AI with Vertex AI, Gemini models, and Gemma models, run remote inference, and streamline data processing with MLTransform. Enhance MLOps and ML job efficiency with Dataflow GPU and right-fitting capabilities.BlogHow Shopify improved consumer search intent with real-time ML using DataflowRead the storyEnable advanced streaming use cases at enterprise scale Dataflow is a fully managed service that uses open source Apache Beam SDK to enable advanced streaming use cases at enterprise scale. It offers rich capabilities for state and time, transformations, and I/O connectors. Dataflow scales to 4K workers per job and routinely processes petabytes of data. It features autoscaling for optimal resource utilization in both batch and streaming pipelines.Learn more about Apache Beam and Dataflow5:39Deploy multimodal data processing for gen AIDataflow enables parallel ingestion and transformation of multimodal data like images, text, and audio. It applies specialized feature extraction for each modality, then fuses these features into a unified representation. This fused data feeds into generative AI models, empowering them to create new content from the diverse inputs. Internal Google teams leverage Dataflow and FlumeJava to organize and compute model predictions for a large pool of available input data with no latency requirements.Accelerate time to value with templates and notebooksDataflow has tools that make it easy to get started. Dataflow templates are pre-designed blueprints for stream and batch processing and are optimized for efficient CDC and BigQuery data integration. Iteratively build pipelines with the latest data science frameworks from the ground up with Vertex AI notebooks and deploy with the Dataflow runner. Dataflow job builder is a visual UI for building and running Dataflow pipelines in the Google Cloud console, without writing code.Save time with smart diagnostics and monitoring toolsDataflow offers comprehensive diagnostics and monitoring tools. Straggler detection automatically identifies performance bottlenecks, while data sampling allows observing data at each pipeline step. Dataflow Insights offer recommendations for job improvements. The Dataflow UI provides rich monitoring tools, including job graphs, execution details, metrics, autoscaling dashboards, and logging. Dataflow also features a job cost monitoring UI for easy cost estimation.Built-in governance and securityDataflow helps you protect your data in a number of ways: encrypting data in use with confidential VM support; customer managed encryption keys (CMEK); VPC Service Controls integration; turning off public IPs. Dataflow audit logging gives your organization the visibility into Dataflow usage and helps answer the question “Who did what, where, and when?" for better governance.View all featuresHow It WorksDataflow is a fully managed platform for batch and streaming data processing. It enables scalable ETL pipelines, real-time stream analytics, real-time ML, and complex data transformations using Apache Beam's unified model, all on serverless Google Cloud infrastructure.Try Dataflow freeLearn Dataflow in a minute, including how it works and common use casesCommon UsesReal-time analyticsTutorials, quickstarts, & labsBring in streaming data for real-time analytics and operational pipelinesStart your data streaming journey by integrating your streaming data sources (Pub/Sub, Kafka, CDC events, user clickstream, logs, and sensor data) into BigQuery, Google Cloud Storage data lakes, Spanner, Bigtable, SQL stores, Splunk, Datadog, and more.
