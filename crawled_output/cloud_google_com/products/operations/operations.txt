Get advanced performance, troubleshooting, security, and business insights with Log Analytics, integrating the power of BigQuery into Cloud Logging. Built-in metrics observability at scaleCloud Monitoring provides visibility into the performance, uptime, and overall health of cloud-powered applications. Collect metrics, events, and metadata from Google Cloud services, hosted uptime probes, application instrumentation, and a variety of common application components. Visualize this data on charts and dashboards and create alerts so you are notified when metrics are outside of expected ranges.Stand-alone managed service for running and scaling PrometheusManaged Service for Prometheus is a fully managed Prometheus-compatible monitoring solution, built on top of the same globally scalable data store as Cloud Monitoring. Keep your existing visualization, analysis, and alerting services, as this data can be queried with PromQL or Cloud Monitoring.Monitor and improve your application's performanceApplication Performance Management (APM) combines the monitoring and troubleshooting capabilities of Cloud Logging and Cloud Monitoring with Cloud Trace and Cloud Profiler to help you reduce latency and cost so you can run more efficient applications.View all featuresData governance: Principles for securing and managing logsGet the whitepaperCustomersLearn from customers using operations toolsBlog postHow The Home Depot gets a single pane of glass for metrics across 2,200 stores4-min readBlog postHow Lowe’s evolved app dev and deployment with Google Cloud6-min readBlog postHow Lowe’s meets customer demand with Google SRE practices4-min readCase studyGannett improves observability with Google Cloud's Observability7-min readVideoNiantic shares best practices for custom metric telemetry on Google CloudVideo (3:22)VideoShopify analyzes distributed trace data to identify performance bottlenecksVideo (5:35)See all customersWhat's newWhat's newSign up for Google Cloud newsletters to receive product updates, event information, special offers, and more.EventListen to a recent Twitter Space event about Log Analytics from Cloud LoggingLearn moreBlog postThe digital forecast: 30-plus cloud computing stats and trends to know in 2023Read the blogBlog postLog Analytics in Cloud Logging is now GALearn moreBlog postTop 10 reasons to get started with Log Analytics todayRead the blogBlog postIntroducing a high-usage tier for Managed Service for PrometheusRead the blogBlog postGoogle Cloud Managed Service for Prometheus is now GARead the blogDocumentationDocumentationTutorialObservability documentationView all documentation for the Observability.Learn moreTutorialGet started with Cloud MonitoringLearn about metrics scopes, the monitoring agent, uptime checks, and other features.Learn moreTutorialGet started with Cloud LoggingGuides and set-up docs to help you get up and running with Cloud Logging.Learn moreGoogle Cloud BasicsMonitoring and logging support for GKELearn about Google Kubernetes Engine’s native integration with Cloud Monitoring and Cloud Logging.Learn moreArchitectureGoogle Cloud metricsSee which metrics Cloud Monitoring supports.Learn moreTutorialHands-on labs: Google Cloud’s ObservabilityIn this skill badge, you’ll learn the ins and outs of Google Cloud's Observability to generate insights into the health of your applications.Learn moreTutorialDashboard API: Build your own Cloud Monitoring dashboardTips for shareable and reusable dashboard creation.Learn moreTutorialCloud Audit LogsLearn how Cloud Audit Logs maintains three audit logs: admin activity, data access, and system event.Learn moreArchitectureHybrid and multi-cloud deploymentsThis document discusses monitoring and logging architectures for hybrid and multi-cloud deployments.Learn moreNot seeing what you’re looking for?View all product documentationExplore more docsGet a quick intro to using this product.Learn to complete specific tasks with this product.Browse guides and tutorials for this product.View APIs, references, and other resources for this product.Release notesRead about the latest releases for the Observability Use casesUse casesUse caseMonitor your infrastructureCloud Logging and Cloud Monitoring provide your IT Ops/SRE/DevOps teams with out-of-the box observability needed to monitor your infrastructure and applications.

All logs, including audit logs, platform logs, and user logs, are sent to the Cloud Logging API where they pass through the log router. The log router checks each log entry against existing rules to determine which log entries to discard, which to ingest, and which to include in exports.Proactive monitoringCloud Monitoring allows you to create alerting policies to notify you when metrics, health check results, and uptime check results meet specified criteria. Integrated with a wide variety of notification channels, including Slack and PagerDuty.Prometheus as a managed serviceOffload the scaling and management of Prometheus infrastructure, updates, storage, and more with Managed Service for Prometheus. Avoid vendor lock-in and keep all of the open source tools you use today for visualization, alerting, and analysis of Prometheus metrics.Custom visualizationCloud Monitoring provides default out-of-the-box dashboards and allows you to define custom dashboards with powerful visualization tools to suit your needs.Health check monitoringCloud Monitoring provides uptime checks to web applications and other internet-accessible services running on your cloud environment. You can configure uptime checks associated with URLs, groups, or resources, such as instances and load balancers.Service monitoringService monitoring provides out-of-the-box telemetry and dashboards that allow troubleshooting in context through topology and context graphs, plus automation of health monitoring through SLOs and error budget management.Latency managementCloud Trace provides latency sampling and reporting for App Engine, including per-URL statistics and latency distributions.Performance and cost managementCloud Profiler provides continuous profiling of resource consumption in your production applications, helping you identify and eliminate potential performance issues.Security managementCloud Audit Logs provides near real-time user activity visibility across Google Cloud.PricingPricingThe pricing for Google Cloud's Observability lets you control your usage and spending.

Your bill might refer to the old pricing language.6 For pricing purposes, all units are treated as binary measures, for example, as mebibytes (MiB, or 220 bytes) or gibibytes (GiB, or 230 bytes).† Google Cloud Managed Service for Prometheus uses Cloud Monitoring storage for externally created metric data and uses the Monitoring API to retrieve that data. Managed Service for Prometheus meters based on samples ingested instead of bytes to align with Prometheus' conventions. For more information about sample-based metering, see Pricing for controllability and predictability. For computational examples, see Pricing examples based on samples ingested.# Samples are counted per billing account.‡ Executions are charged to the billing account in which they are defined. For more information, see Pricing for uptime-check execution.* Executions are charged to the billing account in which they are defined. For each execution, you might incur additional charges from other Google Cloud services, including services, such as Cloud Functions, Cloud Storage, and Cloud Logging.
