Storage Intelligence eliminates manual storage management practices. This unified management product offers multiple powerful features to analyze large storage estates and easily take actions. Analyze object and bucket metadata to derive cost and security insights about your data through Insights Datasets. Use Gemini Cloud Assist to generate insights with natural language conversations. Perform actions at-scale on millions of objects with zero or no code with Batch Operations and minimize application downtime by moving entire buckets with just two commands, while preserving bucket name with Bucket Relocation.Manage your storage at scaleAccelerate your data accessEnhance the performance of demanding applications with Anywhere Cache, a fully managed, intelligent SSD-backed read cache for Region, Dual-region, or Multi-region buckets. Combined with Multi-region buckets, Anywhere Cache brings your data closer to compute resources in any zone where your TPUs/GPUs are available, giving you low latency and high throughput of up to 20 Tbps for AI/ML and data analytics workloads. Benefit from minimizing your network egress costs when accessing data across a continent without the need for provisioning or managing a separate storage tier.Object- and bucket-level permissionsCloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) allows you to control who has access to your buckets and objects.Leading analytics and ML/AI toolsOnce your data is stored in Cloud Storage, easily plug into Google Cloud’s powerful tools to create your data warehouse with BigQuery, run open source analytics with Dataproc, or build and deploy machine learning (ML) models with Vertex AI. Start querying Cloud Storage data with BigQueryAutomatic storage class transitionsWith features like Object Lifecycle Management (OLM) and Autoclass you can easily optimize costs with object placement across storage classes. You can enable, at the bucket level, policy-based automatic object movement to colder storage classes based on the last access time. There are no early deletion or retrieval fees, nor class transition charges for object access in colder storage classes.  IDC projects that Cloud Storage customers can realize average annual benefits worth $86,500 per petabyte. Read report.Continental-scale and SLA-backed replicationIndustry leading dual-region buckets support an expansive number of regions. A single, continental-scale bucket offers nine regions across three continents, providing a Recovery Time Objective (RTO) of zero. In the event of an outage, applications seamlessly access the data in the alternate region. There is no failover and failback process. For organizations requiring ultra availability, turbo replication with dual-region buckets offers a 15 minute Recovery Point Objective (RPO) SLA. Use Cloud Storage as a local filesystemCloud Storage is a common choice for storing training data, models, and checkpoints for machine learning projects in Cloud Storage buckets. With Cloud Storage FUSE, you can take advantage of the scale, affordability, throughput, and simplicity that Cloud Storage provides, while maintaining compatibility with applications that use or require filesystem semantics. Cloud Storage FUSE also now offers caching, which provides up to 2.2x faster time to train and 2.9x higher training throughput, compared to native ML framework dataloaders.Learn how Cloud Storage FUSE is optimized for GKE and AI workloadsFast and flexible transfer servicesStorage Transfer Service offers a highly performant, online pathway to Cloud Storage—both with the scalability and speed you need to simplify the data transfer process. For offline data transfer our Transfer Appliance is a shippable storage server that sits in your datacenter and then ships to an ingest location where the data is uploaded to Cloud Storage.VIDEOIntroducing Google Cloud’s Transfer Appliance2:54Default and configurable data securityCloud Storage offers secure-by-design features to protect your data and advanced controls and capabilities to keep your data private and secure against leaks or compromises. Security features include access control policies, data encryption, retention policies, retention policy locks, and signed URLs.Object lifecycle managementDefine conditions that trigger data deletion or transition to a cheaper storage class.Object Versioning	Continue to store old copies of objects when they are deleted or overwritten.Soft deleteSoft delete offers improved protection against accidental and malicious data deletion by providing you with a way to retain and restore recently deleted data.Retention policiesDefine minimum retention periods that objects must be stored for before they’re deletable.Object holdsPlace a hold on an object to prevent its deletion.Customer-managed encryption keysEncrypt object data with encryption keys stored by the Cloud Key Management Service and managed by you.Customer-supplied encryption keys	Encrypt object data with encryption keys created and managed by you.Uniform bucket-level accessUniformly control access to your Cloud Storage resources by disabling object ACLs.Requester paysRequire accessors of your data to include a project ID to bill for network charges, operation charges, and retrieval fees.Bucket LockBucket Lock allows you to configure a data retention policy for a Cloud Storage bucket that governs how long objects in the bucket must be retained.Pub/Sub notifications for Cloud Storage	Send notifications to Pub/Sub when objects are created, updated, or deleted.Cloud Audit Logs with Cloud StorageMaintain admin activity logs and data access logs for your Cloud Storage resources.View all featuresStorage optionsStorage typeDescriptionBest forStandard storageStorage for data that is frequently accessed ("hot" data) and/or stored for only brief periods of time."Hot" data, including websites, streaming videos, and mobile apps.Nearline storageLow cost, highly durable storage service for storing infrequently accessed data.Data that can be stored for 30 days.Coldline storageA very low cost, highly durable storage service for storing infrequently accessed data.Data that can be stored for 90 days.Archive storageThe lowest cost, highly durable storage service for data archiving, online backup, and disaster recovery.Data that can be stored for 365 days.Learn more about storage classes.Standard storageDescriptionStorage for data that is frequently accessed ("hot" data) and/or stored for only brief periods of time.Best for"Hot" data, including websites, streaming videos, and mobile apps.Nearline storageDescriptionLow cost, highly durable storage service for storing infrequently accessed data.Best forData that can be stored for 30 days.Coldline storageDescriptionA very low cost, highly durable storage service for storing infrequently accessed data.Best forData that can be stored for 90 days.Archive storageDescriptionThe lowest cost, highly durable storage service for data archiving, online backup, and disaster recovery.Best forData that can be stored for 365 days.Learn more about storage classes.How It WorksTo use Cloud Storage, you’ll first create a bucket, a basic container that holds your data in Cloud Storage. You’ll then upload objects into that bucket—where you can download, share, and manage objects.View documentationWhat is Cloud Storage? (2:05)Common UsesBackups and archivesTutorials, quickstarts, & labsUse Cloud Storage for backup, archives, and recoveryCloud Storage's nearline storage provides fast, low-cost, highly durable storage for data accessed less than once a month, reducing the cost of backups and archives while still retaining immediate access. Backup data in Cloud Storage can be used for more than just recovery because all storage classes have ms latency and are accessed through a single API.Learn more about nearline storageTutorials, quickstarts, & labsUse Cloud Storage for backup, archives, and recoveryCloud Storage's nearline storage provides fast, low-cost, highly durable storage for data accessed less than once a month, reducing the cost of backups and archives while still retaining immediate access.

Cloud Storage is a service for storing objects in Google Cloud. An object is an immutable piece of data consisting of a file of any format. You store objects in containers called buckets. All buckets are associated with a project, and you can group your projects under an organization.
