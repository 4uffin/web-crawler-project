Intelligence teams use credible insights from multiple sources to create actionable context on the threat landscape, threat actors and their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). The effective use of CTI allows organizations to make the shift from being reactive to becoming more proactive against threat actors.How can CTI be used to make security more
proactive?Credible threat intelligence can be used to understand the malware and TTPs threat actors use and the vulnerabilities they exploit to target specific industries and regions. Organizations use this intelligence to implement, configure, and adjust security tools, and train staff to thwart attacks.What is a threat actor?A threat actor is a person or group of people who conduct malicious targeting or attacks on others. Typically motivated by espionage, financial gain, or publicity, threat actors may conduct a full campaign alone or work with other groups who specialize in specific aspects of an attack.How can you identify active threats?Assuming we all agree that a “threat” is defined as a plan or inclination to attack as opposed to an “attack” which is an existing or previously successful breach. Identifying active threats can be done using threat intelligence which will help provide context into the threat actors and malware impacting your specific region or industry. Another method to identify active threats is by scanning the open, deep, and dark web for chatter around your organization, personnel, technology, or partners. By identifying these threats, security professionals can proactively adjust their defenses to block or reduce the impact of a potential attack.What are the three types of CTI?Strategic – High level trends used to drive business decisions and security investments.Operational – Contextual information on impending threats to the organization, used by security professionals to understand more about threat actors and their TTPs.Tactical – Understanding of the threat actor TTPs, used by security professionals to stop incidents and make defensive adjustments.menuOverviewSolutionsProductsPricingResourcesDocsSupportContact Ussearch_sparksend_sparkDocsSupportConsoleSign inIncident Response AssistanceSecurityThreat IntelSecOpsCloud
