My wordpress site is taking payments on desktop but not mobile. I use the theme "Hello Elementor," WooCommerce, and take payments with Square. Might I ad I used Elementor as the theme builder.
When I attempt to checkout on mobile, upon placing order, it loads for a while then remains static. NOT the problem on desktop.
Has anyone had this problem, or know a solution?
Any help is much appreciated.
