"Council Members ignored when the United States made clear that this resolution was unacceptable. The Council instead opted for a performative action -- designed to draw a veto -- that extends Hamas terrorists and those who fund them and support them, and gives them a lifeline," U.S. United Nations Counselor Morgan Ortagus said in a statement delivered to the USSC before the vote. "It is beyond time that Hamas release every single hostage now and surrender immediately. The United States will continue to work with its partners to bring an end to this horrific conflict for the sake of the people of Gaza, who deserve a future free from Hamas, and of the whole Middle East, which is ready to move to a new chapter of peace and prosperity," Ortagus added. -ABC News' Shannon K.
