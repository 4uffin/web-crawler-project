"It is beyond time that Hamas release every single hostage now and surrender immediately. The United States will continue to work with its partners to bring an end to this horrific conflict for the sake of the people of Gaza, who deserve a future free from Hamas, and of the whole Middle East, which is ready to move to a new chapter of peace and prosperity," Ortagus added. -ABC News' Shannon K.

"Despite numerous warnings on the humanitarian impact of a Gaza City takeover, the International Rescue Committee (IRC) and our partners have been forced to close all of our programming. The solution is tragically simple," Bob Kitchen, vice president of emergencies at the humanitarian aid organization, said in a statement."Nutrition treatment for malnourished children and pregnant women has stopped, and our protection services for women and children who have experienced violence have been interrupted -- though we continue to monitor cases as families relocate," he wrote.
