"And importantly, we have to talk about this incredibly destructive movement of left-wing extremism that has grown up over the last few years and, I believe, is part of the reason why Charlie was killed by an assassin's bullet."Since Kirk was fatally shot at a college campus event in Utah on Sept. 10, President Donald Trump and top officials have sought to predominately blame the "radical left" for political violence in the country despite attacks against both Democrats and Republicans in recent years.FBI Co-Deputy Director Dan Bongino said Monday on Fox News that the suspect arrested in Kirk's fatal shooting -- 22-year-old Tyler Robinson -- had an "obsession" with the conservative influencer, based on the alleged shooter's digital footprint. Robinson was tracking Kirk's events and public appearances through open-sourced information on the internet, according to law enforcement officials familiar with the investigation.Bongino said Robinson "had become more political" before the shooting, though the motivation for the shooting is still not clear.Federal and state law enforcement officials are going through Robinson's electronic devices and are continuing to interview family, friends and associates as they seek more evidence to bolster their case and also establish a motive.MORE: Republicans blame 'radical left' for Kirk shooting, Democrats reject that claimVance and White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, on Monday's show, described how the administration intends to take action against groups they say are responsible for inspiring political violence."We're going to go after the [non-governmental organization] network that foments, facilitates and engages in violence," Vance said. "That's not OK. Violence is not OK in our system, and we want to make it less likely that that happens."Vance later claimed, "This is not a both sides problem. If both sides have a problem, then one side has a much bigger and malignant problem and that is the truth."Vice President JD Vance hosts an episode of 'The Charlie Kirk Show' at the White House, following the assassination of the show's namesake, in Washington, Sept, 15, 2025.The Charlie Kirk ShowMiller, who on Fox News last month called the Democratic Party a "domestic-extremist organization," said the administration is going to "channel all of the anger that we have over the organized campaign that led to this assassination to uproot and dismantle these terrorist networks.""It is a vast domestic terror movement, and with God as my witness, we are going to use every resource we have at the Department of Justice, Homeland Security and throughout this government to identify, disrupt, dismantle and destroy these networks and make America safe again for the American people. It will happen, and we will do it in Charlie's name," Miller said.Miller didn't point to any specific groups.Popular ReadsAlleged shooter in Charlie Kirk killing had 'obsession' with influencer: FBI2 hours agoTrump admin live updates: Bessent says 'framework' for TikTok deal has been reached2 hours agoHere are the states banning cellphones in schools and what it means for studentsSep 15, 5:19 AMOn Fox News' "Hannity" last Friday, Miller suggested the government could pursue charges under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) or conspiracy charges against certain groups.A video feed is displayed in the White House Briefing Room as Vice President JD Vance hosts a podcast episode of 'The Charlie Kirk Show' following the assassination of the show's namesake, at the White House, September 15, 2025 in Washington.Kevin Dietsch/Getty ImagesMORE: Trump doubles down on blaming 'radical left' after vow to go after political violenceTrump on Sunday suggested his government was already working to follow through on his vow to target those he claims contribute to political violence."They're already under major investigation.

Some instances have been recorded of institutions or companies firing workers who allegedly posted such sentiments on social media.Vance, on Kirk's show on Monday, encouraged listeners to respond to such social media posts."When you see someone celebrating Charlie's murder, call them out. And hell, call their employer," Vance said.In his closing remarks, Vance said the best way to honor Kirk was to "shine the light of truth like a torch.""I can't promise you this is gonna be easy. Can't promise you that all of us will avoid Charlie's fate. Can't promise you that I will avoid Charlie's fate, but the way to honor him is to shine the light of truth like a torch in the very darkest places," Vance said.Related TopicsCharlie Kirk shootingJD Vance Sponsored Content by TaboolaPopular ReadsAlleged shooter in Charlie Kirk killing had 'obsession' with influencer: FBI2 hours agoTrump admin live updates: Bessent says 'framework' for TikTok deal has been reached2 hours agoHere are the states banning cellphones in schools and what it means for studentsSep 15, 5:19 AMBritish politicians condemn Elon Musk's comments at anti-migrant rallySep 15, 5:52 AMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContact Us Â© 2025 ABC News
