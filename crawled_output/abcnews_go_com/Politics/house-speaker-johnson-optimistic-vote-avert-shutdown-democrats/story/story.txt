Annabelle Gordon/ReutersHouse Republicans plan to vote Friday morning on a short-term measure to fund the government as a shutdown deadline nears, hoping to keep pressure on Democrats who have signaled they will vote to shut down the government if Republicans don't cave to Democratic demands to restore cuts to Medicaid and extend Obamacare subsidies set to expire at the end of the year.House Majority Leader Steve Scalise announced Thursday afternoon that the House would vote on the measure at 10:20 a.m. Friday.House Speaker Mike Johnson expressed cautious optimism Thursday that Republicans will pass their 52-day continuing resolution on Friday -- a week ahead of the Sept. 30 deadline to fund the government."I think we have the votes and I think it's just very unfortunate the Democrats are trying to play partisan games when we're in good faith trying to fund the government," Johnson told reporters as he arrived at the Capitol on Thursday. "So, this is a clean, short-term CR. There's no tricks to this at all. It's a total good faith effort to allow appropriators on both sides of the aisle to continue their work. I don't know how they can object to it. I really don't."MORE: Democrats set fight over health care as possible government shutdown loomsWith a narrow 219-213 edge over Democrats, Johnson can afford to lose just two Republican defectors in a vote on passage. Several hardline Republicans have signaled they intend to vote against it -- though the speaker has repeatedly overcome last-minute holdouts -- even if President Donald Trump's arm-twisting is required to bring the final votes to heel.Speaker of the House of Representatives Mike Johnson waits for Ecumenical Patriarch and Archbishop of Constantinople Bartholomew I to join him in a photo op on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., Sept. 17, 2025.Annabelle Gordon/ReutersFor his part, Trump urged House Republicans to support the "clean" funding bill Thursday afternoon."Every House Republican should UNIFY, and VOTE YES!" Trump posted to his social media platform. He also repeated his claim that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Democratic lawmakers want a government shutdown.The funding plan proposes $30 million in additional member security over a more than seven-week stretch -- giving each member of Congress around $7,500 each week to spend on security -- more than double their own congressional salary. The package also includes $58 million to meet the Trump administration's request for supplemental funding for the executive and judicial branches.That funding supplants a pilot funding program that lawmakers had utilized for member security in the wake of the shooting targeting state lawmakers in Minnesota over the summer.Popular ReadsTrump admin live updates: Trump says he wants Bagram base in Afghanistan 'back'3 hours agoTrump admin updates: Trump plans to issue executive order to require voter IDAug 31, 2:39 PMTrump greeted by king, thousands of protesters in UK visitSep 17, 4:56 PMMinority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has expressed opposition to the funding bill and Democrats are likely to follow his lead and vote against it."We will not support a partisan spending bill that Republicans are trying to jam down the throats of the American people that continues to gut health care.

This plan is a non-starter with Republicans who control majorities in both chambers.The GOP plan, however, presents a real challenge in the Senate -- if it passes the House -- requiring at least seven Democratic votes to reach 60 votes for passage.Senate Majority Leader John Thune has urged Senate Democrats to support the short-term measure, arguing the bill is a clean extension of funding."There's nothing in here about President Trump," Thune said on the Senate floor this week. "This is a clean funding resolution, bipartisan funding resolution, short-term, to allow the Appropriations Committee to do its work."Related TopicsGovernment ShutdownSponsored Content by TaboolaPopular ReadsTrump admin live updates: Trump says he wants Bagram base in Afghanistan 'back'3 hours agoTrump greeted by king, thousands of protesters in UK visitSep 17, 4:56 PMCharlie Kirk leaves behind wife, 2 kids: What to knowSep 18, 1:07 PMTrump admin updates: Trump plans to issue executive order to require voter IDAug 31, 2:39 PMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContact Us Â© 2025 ABC News
