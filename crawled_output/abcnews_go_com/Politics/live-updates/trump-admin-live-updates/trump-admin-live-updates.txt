They don't want to deny it. They said, ‘Well, I'd rather not talk.’ I said– ‘What do you mean? You'd rather not. That means you're guilty, right?’ Yeah, no, they agree.”Trump again claimed that he was ready to impose secondary sanctions on Russia despite bypassing his own self-imposed deadline to implement them, but needed Europe to contribute equally.“Well, I'm ready to move ahead, but they have to do it. I think they will. But right now they're talking and they're not doing,” said Trump.“I'm willing to do sanctions, but they're going to have to toughen up their sanctions, commensurate with what I'm doing.”The president also sounded less confident that a trilateral meeting between him, Putin and Zelenskyy is on the horizon. Arguing that Putin and Zelenskyy hate each other so much, they’re “incapable of talking.”“Whether you call it a summit or just a get-together, it doesn't matter, but I'll probably have to get involved. They hate each other so much they almost can't talk. They're incapable of talking to each other.”1 hour and 15 minutes agoTrump doesn’t rule out strikes on mainland VenezuelaDuring his press gaggle Sunday evening, President Donald Trump was asked if he would consider strikes against mainland Venezuela. He didn’t rule out the possibility of striking parts of the country.“We’ll see what happens. Look, Venezuela is sending us their gang members, their drug dealers and drugs. It's not acceptable,” Trump said.Asked if he’ll order more strikes on Venezuela’s vessels, Trump said he’ll see what happens.“There's certainly not a lot of boats out there, I'll tell you, since the first strike, and then, to a lesser extent, the second, we don't see any. I mean, we almost see no boats out there, which is fine. As far as I'm concerned, there's been very little boat traffic.”Trump told reporters he’s been briefed about Venezuela, accusing the United States Navy of boarding a fishing vessel in their own waters. While answering the question, Trump touted his efforts to stop drugs from coming into the U.S. from Venezuela.-ABC News' Lalee Ibssa and Hannah Demissie 4:17 PM EDTTrump wants additional $58M to boost securityThe Trump administration requested that Congress approve an additional $58 million to boost security for members of the executive and judicial branches following the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, multiple sources familiar with the matter told ABC News.In the formal request, the administration also outlined its support to increase security and protective measures for the legislative branch but is deferring to Congress on the implementation, sources say.
