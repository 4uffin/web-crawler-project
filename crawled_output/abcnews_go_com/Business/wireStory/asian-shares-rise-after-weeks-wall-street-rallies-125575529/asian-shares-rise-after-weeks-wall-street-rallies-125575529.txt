(AP Photo/Lee Jin-man)The Associated PressTOKYO -- Asian shares were mostly higher Monday, after Wall finished the previous week near their record levels.Hong Kong's Hang Seng added 0.4% to 26,505.18. The Shanghai Composite edged up 0.2% to 3,878.57. Worries are simmering about China's economy, as analysts say the data for August aren't strong enough to reflect ongoing dynamic growth, especially given the damage from U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies. China's retail sales rose 3.4%, and factory output was up 5.2%. “The underlying flow is shifting. For years, Beijing leaned on exports as the carry trade that kept growth rolling even as property cracked. But with Trump’s tariffs slicing through supply chains, that leg of the trade is gone,” said Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 lost 0.3% to 8,836.50, while South Korea's Kospi gained 0.4% to 3,409.94. Stock trading was closed Monday for a national holiday in Japan.Wall Street ended Friday with the S&P 500 edging down by less than 0.1% from the all-time high set Thursday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 273 points, or 0.6%, while the Nasdaq composite added 0.4%. The recent rallies are coming because of expectations the Federal Reserve will cut its main interest rate
for the first time this year at its meeting next week. That means that, if the interest rate cuts don't happen, the market could drop in disappointment.
