Serial Productions makes narrative podcasts whose quality and innovation transformed the medium.
Listen to The Retrievals, Season 2 ›
We launched the “Serial” podcast in 2014 as a spinoff of the revered public radio show “This American Life.” The series was an instant, unprecedented hit and set a new standard for investigative audio reporting and storytelling. We followed that up with “S-Town,” another blockbuster, and Serial Productions was born.In 2020, after releasing two more seasons of the “Serial” podcast, we joined The New York Times Company. Together with The Times, we launched “Nice White Parents,” a provocative series about the powerful forces shaping public schools; “The Improvement Association,” a true story about election fraud in North Carolina; and “The Trojan Horse Affair,” an investigation into the mystery at the heart of a scandal that rocked Britain.Our shows have reached many millions of listeners, and have won nearly every major journalism award for audio, including the first-ever Peabody Award given to a podcast.We continue to experiment with the podcast form, making deeply reported stories that feel surprising, emotional and personal. We're currently at work on a slate of new shows, releasing throughout the year.
