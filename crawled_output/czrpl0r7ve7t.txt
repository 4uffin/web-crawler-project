Trouble for Richie Ramsay who has been putting together a gutsy round.He goes virtually nowhere with his third shot out of the greenside bunker, leaving it stuck in the rough flanking the green.He'll have to go again and leaves himself 12 feet for bogey. Oh, it's missed. What a shame. He'll drop two shots.

Current leader Adrien Saddier is safely onto the 16th green as the sun now bathes Wentworth Golf Club in golden light.He's a long way back from the pin, 52 feet or so, but having drained from 48 feet on the previous hole, who knows what will happen next.

Fine work from Tyrrell Hatton after laying up at the par-five 18th, lofting his approach onto the green and teeing up a birdie chance from seven feet or so.He'll have a tasty uphill putt to set the target.

Lengthy putt here for Viktor Hovland to save bogey and he doesn't. It's a brutal double bogey for the Norwegian.Amid the carnage of Hovland's hole, Justin Rose has quietly set up an eagle chance to really turn his round back on its head.He leaves it short but it's a welcome birdie for the Englishman who is still three over so far today.

23Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingPostpublished at 16:24 BST16:24 BSTHovland -13 (11)
More clumsiness from Viktor Hovland down this 12th hole and very soon Tyrrell Hatton could be in the lead.The Norwegian is at the front of the green chipping on with his fourth shot and he's hugely overcooked it, bumping it way over the back.And that'll be for par.The leader unravelling somewhat here.
