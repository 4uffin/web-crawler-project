Angry reaction from Justin Rose as he completely skews his tee shot at the par-three fifth.Some rare colourful language from the Englishman as he contemplates chipping onto the green from the path.

Ah, hit it Ludvig!It's a lengthy putt for the Swede so a two-putt par is just fine. Still he had the line and it just came up short.
03Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingHovland stretches lead, birdie for Rosepublished at 14:16 BST14:16 BSTMatusyama -10, Hovland -14, Rose -10 (4)
Much better news for Justin Rose as he cleans up for his first birdie of the day. He joins Hideki Matsuyama at 10 under.The leader is stretching away though. Viktor Hovland's third birdie of the opening four holes sees him take a two-shot lead.
10Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingDouble bogey for Matsuyamapublished at 14:15 BST14:15 BSTMatsuyama -10 (4)
Ugly for Hideki Matsuyama at the fourth. After scraping himself to limit the damage to bogey, he misses from four feet and it's the first double here today. Away he drops from the lead.
10Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingPostpublished at 14:11 BST14:11 BSTMatusyama -12, Hovland -13, Rose -9 (3)
Justin Rose is just behind the fourth green with his third shot on this hole, chipping out of the rough to set up a birdie chance.Beautifully judged and he should be able to tidy up.I'd imagine Viktor Hovland will also get himself a shot - terrifically played out of the sand from the Norwegian.

Plenty of people helping Hideki Matsuyama forage in the undergrowth for his ball down the left side of the fourth fairway.He gets three minutes to find it and it looks like the search has been abandoned.A hole that has been the easiest on the course today is going to pass him by - and could be costly.
01Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingAberg settles for birdiepublished at 14:01 BST14:01 BSTAberg -12 (4)
Speaking of eagle opportunities, one here for Ludvig Aberg would see him join Viktor Hovland at the top.Five feet and he's missed it. As emotional a look as Ludvig ever gives follows (the slight downturn of the mouth) and then a tap-in birdie.It moves him one off the lead.

Hello, here comes another Brit up to 10 under par - and it's a Scotsman getting an eagle at the fourth!As Ewen Ferguson did about 10 minutes ago, Richie Ramsay has tickled his putt in to pick up two shots - and join Aaron Rai three off the lead.

As one Englishman slips away from -10, another is making his own move.A birdie for Aaron Rai moves him up to fourth, three back off the lead.
12Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingHovland seizes leadpublished at 13:52 BST13:52 BSTMatusyama -12, Hovland -13, Rose -9 (3)
Remember when I told you the third was a tricky hole?Not for Viktor Hovland. He's grabbed the lead outright with an excellent 14-foot birdie putt.Big move from the Norwegian today.More frustration for Justin Rose though as he gifts another shot back.

Weather update for you after that dark cloud opened up its wares about half an hour ago.Wentworth is now bathed in sunshine.Welcome to England.
40Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingEagle alert for Fergusonpublished at 13:49 BST13:49 BSTFerguson -8 (4)
It's not been a fun start for Ewen Ferguson, dropping three shots over his first three holes, but that should cheer him up.A fine eagle at the fourth gets his scorecard moving in the right direction.
22Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingBogey for Abergpublished at 13:43 BST13:43 BSTAberg -11 (3)
The difficult third has had its way with Ludvig Aberg and he's trudging off the green after making bogey and dropping out of the lead.Must have known I'd put him in the headline and image on this live.So now I'll have to go and change that.

Image source, Getty ImagesLoud cheers reverberate around the 13th green as Rory McIlroy goes back-to-back on the birdie train.That's three shots picked up in four holes for last week's Irish Open champ, and the crowd loved it.A chance for a good finish too.

The par-three second is playing very short today at just 136 yards.Our final group all get themselves birdie putts but none of the trio can convert.And in fact, Justin Rose sloppily gives away a shot there to drop a couple back. An unusual mistake from the Englishman.
29Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingLowry picks up the pacepublished at 13:34 BST13:34 BSTLowry -7 (12)
We're not seeing anything of Shane Lowry but the popular Irishman is assembling a fine round.Four under and no bogeys on the card through 12 holes, he's climbed into the top 20.
61Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingAberg also leads the waypublished at 13:23 BST13:23 BSTAberg -12 (2)
We have a three-way tie at the top. Strap in, this is how it's going to be today.Ludvig Aberg produces a divine tee shot at the second and buries the birdie putt to move to -12.
50Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingHovland into share of leadpublished at 13:23 BST13:23 BSTMatusyama -12, Hovland -12, Rose -11 (1)
Marker laid down by Viktor Hovland at the first! He's just downed a 30-foot putt for birdie and he joins Hideki Matsuyama at -12 after the overnight leader makes par.A scrambling Justin Rose gives himself a chance and he saves from eight feet. Gutsy.
60Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingNiemann signs for seven-under 65published at 13:20 BST13:20 BSTNiemann -9 (65)
Image source, Getty ImagesThe best player on the course today has been Joaquin Niemann and he's got a chance to sign for a 64 at the 18th.He plays it beautifully out of the bunker and should capitalise with the short putt. No - missed!Still, it's been a cracking day for the Chilean who closes three back from the lead.
