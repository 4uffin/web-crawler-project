Urgh, poor Justin Rose. It's kissed the side of the hole, rolled round and then rolled out.Ever the gentleman, he touches his cap to the crowd and thanks them but there is a steely glare in his eyes.Four over for the day and that's 10 shots worse than yesterday for the Englishman.

Nicely done Justin Rose and he's warmly applauded by the punters around the 18th green as he clips over the water and to about eight feet.Now then, Viktor Hovland has eagled this hole twice already this week. Do it again and he's back in business.He'll have to manage it from 34 feet though. Ah it comes up short.

Doesn't that sum up Saturday for Justin Rose?He takes aim at the 18th but his ball ends up in the water. Bet he can't wait to get home.Viktor Hovland is still in this tournament though and he's got 215 yards with his second shot.Onto the putting surface - and perhaps he can close out in style.

It's been a lot of fun watching Richie Ramsay and it feels like he has not got his just rewards.That is summed up by his birdie putt staying short at the last and he'll tap in for par.A level-par 72 for the Scot.

Ludvig Aberg shot 64 on Thursday and looked imperious.Six back by the end of the round three wasn't part of the plan.He's got an eagle putt on 18 to trim it and he drags it wide but at least will pick up a birdie.Plenty of food for thought for the Swede.
