We're not seeing anything of Shane Lowry but the popular Irishman is assembling a fine round.Four under and no bogeys on the card through 12 holes, he's climbed into the top 20.

We have a three-way tie at the top. Strap in, this is how it's going to be today.Ludvig Aberg produces a divine tee shot at the second and buries the birdie putt to move to -12.

Marker laid down by Viktor Hovland at the first! He's just downed a 30-foot putt for birdie and he joins Hideki Matsuyama at -12 after the overnight leader makes par.A scrambling Justin Rose gives himself a chance and he saves from eight feet. Gutsy.

Image source, Getty ImagesThe best player on the course today has been Joaquin Niemann and he's got a chance to sign for a 64 at the 18th.He plays it beautifully out of the bunker and should capitalise with the short putt. No - missed!Still, it's been a cracking day for the Chilean who closes three back from the lead.

Yep, it's raining.
21Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingPostpublished at 13:16 BST13:16 BSTMatusyama -12, Hovland -11, Rose -11 (13:00 BST)
An iffy start for Justin Rose, whose ball is buried in the rough and only travelled 240 yards.He bashes his second shot out but it pulls up well short of the green and in more clumpy grass.Hideki Matsuyama misses the green too but Viktor Hovland is safely on - and scurries under his umbrella.
22Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingPar start for Abergpublished at 13:12 BST13:12 BSTAberg -11 (1)
Early chance for Ludvig Aberg to join Matsuyama on top of the pile.No, he's pulled his putt right of the hole at the first.He'll stay one back.

Another player climbing the leaderboard is South Africa's Erik van Rooyen and his rather fine moustache.He's closed out for 66 as well, joining Matt Wallace at eight under for the tournament.
01Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingPostpublished at 13:10 BST13:10 BSTMatusyama -12, Hovland -11, Rose -11 (13:00 BST)
Right then,final group. Justin Rose goes first and flings it left into the trees.Viktor Hovland goes off in a similar direction but works it back for a nice lie on the fairway.The leader Hideki Matsuyama missed this fairway on days one and two but likes this one and bosh, he's in prime spot.
40Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingPostpublished at 13:07 BST13:07 BSTWallace -8 (66)
Another Englishman has also just ended his round.It's a 66 for Matt Wallace with a clean card and a significant move away from the cut line he squeaked over yesterday.Will be a much later start tomorrow.

Midway down the first fairway, we catch up with Pablo Larrabal taking aim at the green.What's caught my eye though is the blackest of black clouds lurking behind the trees.We were forecast rain for this afternoon. That could make things interesting.

Image source, Getty ImagesAt the other end of the course, Rose's Ryder Cup team-mate Tommy Fleetwood is finishing up.It's a bogey at the last for the Englishman to leave him at three under for the tournament. Not in the mix, but not in any trouble of missing out on Sunday.

No doubting the home favourite in the final group.Terrific reception for the grey-jumpered Justin Rose as he strides onto the first tee.Plenty of whistles, cheers and excitement reverberates around the stands.

Image source, Getty ImagesDo you like your golf with a slice of jeopardy?Not content with a cut yesterday, the DP World Tour have put in an additional chop today to get the field down to 78 players for tomorrow's final round.That leaves nine or so players facing an early out and is projected to be at -2. Rory McIlroy and Bob MacIntyre currently at -3 on the back nine just need to make sure they limit mistakes coming home.

Image source, Getty ImagesLudvig Aberg is just one shot back here at Wentworth but it's not enough to get him in the final three-ball today.He's playing alongside Spain's Pablo Larrazabal and Scotland's Richie Ramsay and has just thundered his opening drive down the hill at the first.He'll be taking his second out of the rough.

Image source, Getty ImagesWhat a year it has been for Justin Rose.The evergreen 45-year-old finished second at the Masters in April and won the St Jude Championship on the PGA Tour last month.Now, he's very much in contention for what he described as a "bucket-list win" on his 20th appearance at Wentworth.Undoubtedly the elder statesman of Team Europe, at the moment he is one of its most in-form players.

Tidy start for Matt Fitzpatrick as he picks up a birdie at the second.Playing partner Darren Fichardt of South Africa has begun even better - he's two under through two.Fichardt and Fitzpatrick playing together is a live texter's nightmare.

There are scores out there so far in the sunshine at Wentworth.LIV golfer Joaquin Niemann has been on fire. He only just made this on the line yesterday but a tap-in birdie at the 16th has put him to seven under for his round and up to -9 for the tournament.Playing partner Matt Wallace is also looking good - he's at five under today.Plenty to encourage the leaders.

Just teeing off is three-time winner on the DP World Tour Ewen Ferguson.A 67 and a 68 to start the tournament have put in contention - although he's in some trouble here off the first, down in the trees.He'll be followed down the opening hole by compatriot Richie Ramsay who has got himself into the penultimate group.This is the first cut he's made in six tournaments, but he's in the mix here.
