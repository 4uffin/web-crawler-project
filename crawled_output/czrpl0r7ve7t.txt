One player who refuses to go away is Scotland Richie's Ramsay.After a bogey at the 11th, he's bounced back with a birdie at the 12th to return to 11 under par.Just two shots back.

Some tree trouble incoming for Viktor Hovland at the par-five 12th as he sweeps his drive into the big ones flanking the fairway.A shake of the head as the leader trundles down the hole after it.Hideki Matsuyama will be a lot happier with his - neatly on the fairway.

It's sunny again.What a bizarre day.

âItâs a fascinating day â Iâm enjoying every minute. "The
deluge of rain in a way makes it easier as it makes the greens softer. "Itâs not
pleasant at the time but itâs good if you get through it without taking too
much damage.â

Lovely effort from Hideki Matsuyama out of the rough fringing the 11 the green, his chip just skimming the hole.It's a tidy par for leader Viktor Hovland too.

While all that was going on at the top, some more movement was happening in the top 10.English duo Tyrrell Hatton and Aaron Rai have both nudged up to 11 under par, and very much on the coattails of leader Viktor Hovland.

We're used to the metronomic play of Ludvig Aberg but he is ragged today.He's just made double bogey at the 11th to slip back to nine under par.Fairway bunker, bushes, short of the green. It's entertaining, but it's not helping him close in on this golf tournament.
43Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingNoren par to stay in secondpublished at 15:56 BST15:56 BSTNoren -12 (12)
Will there be two at the top?Alex Noren hopes so as he eyes a 24 footer at the 12th for birdie. No, it's missed.He'll stay in second.
21Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingHovland back in frontpublished at 15:55 BST15:55 BSTMatsuyama -9, Hovland -13, Rose -7 (9)
Lovely for Viktor Hovland as he tidies up. He's back as the solo leader.There's no bounceback birdie for Hideki Matsuyama but it is a par settler after the horror show on the ninth.
51Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingPostpublished at 15:50 BST15:50 BSTHovland -12 (9)
How will Hovland respond at the par-three 10th to losing his lead?In a pretty fine way.One bounce in the rough off the tee, a kick back onto the green and a trundle down to within three feet.Terrific from the Norwegian.

Sunshine. Torrential rain.Get me some footage of a rainbow please.
51Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingHovland slips backpublished at 15:45 BST15:45 BSTHovland -12 (9)
Well, well.A clumsy finish to the front nine for Viktor Hovland as he misses the green with his second and then can't get up and down for par.That's back-to-back bogeys - and he's lost the solo lead.
44Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingTriple bogey for Matsuyamapublished at 15:43 BST15:43 BSTMatsuyama -9 (9)
Just when Hideki Matsuyama had hauled himself back into the mix, he's had a bit of a nightmare down the ninth.Out of bounds with his second shot, he has to take a drop and ends up on the green needing 17 feet to save double bogey.It doesn't go in - and it's a triple for the overnight leader.
64Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingPostpublished at 15:42 BST15:42 BSTRose -7 (9)
Well that's nice to see as Justin Rose takes aim from 14 and a half feet and buries his par putt.Out in 39 for the Englishman but at least that's a good way to finish the front half of his third round.
32Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingSaddier misses birdie chancepublished at 15:41 BST15:41 BSTSaddier -12 (12)
Real chance for Adrien Saddier to join Viktor Hovland at the top but he's missed it.Feels like he would fancy that having that seven-foot birdie putt again.
20Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingNoren up to joint secondpublished at 15:37 BST15:37 BSTNoren -12 (12)
Alex Noren is continuing his hot streak around the turn. Delicious approach and a confident birdie putt from eight feet.The Swede joins the bunch at 12 under, one back from Viktor Hovland.
21Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingBirdie for Abergpublished at 15:35 BST15:35 BSTAberg -11 (10)
Nice work from Ludvig Aberg as he pounds in a birdie at the 10th. That's his 17th of the week - and he'll return to -11 for the tournament.
40Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingPostpublished at 15:34 BST15:34 BSTRamsay -11 (10)
Inches from another birdie for Richie Ramsay over at the 10th - and the disappointment is clear.That just skids by and he'll have to settle for par.

I'm enjoying that little skip from Ludvig Aberg after teeing off on the 10th.He's made a break for the umbrella. It's hosing down at the moment.
40Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingPostpublished at 15:31 BST15:31 BSTFichardt -11 (12), Hall -10 (16)
Just keep the contenders coming. South Africa's Darren Fichardt is four under today and up to -11 while England's Harry Hall is even better at five under for his round and at -10.Leader Viktor Hovland perhaps starting to feel the breath of his pursuers on his neck.
