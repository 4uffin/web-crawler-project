They only seem to be testing individual bees though, not the hive mind.replyfolkrav 4 hours ago

Is there any scientific basis for some kind of shared collective thought I don’t know about? In other words, what’s the “hive mind” if not the collective result of individual minds?replyAlecSchueler 3 hours ago
| root | parent | next [–]
Changes in behaviour in the individual level might result in an apparent cognitive decline for that individual, but could still benefit the hive as a whole.replykbelder 58 minutes ago

If human society changed so that average individual intelligence decreased, but the human race as a whole acted more intelligently, did human intelligence increase or decrease?replyfolkrav 2 hours ago

I was asking about the concept of “hive mind”. Is the concept accepted as a “thing”, has it ever been measured in any way, and if yes, what is it?replyAlecSchueler 1 hour ago
| root | parent | next [–]
Yes, it's the idea that the colony exhibits behaviour with a level of intelligence impossible for any of the single bees. Things like choosing the location of the nest or managing the temperature of the nest, there's various decisions "made" by the colony as a kind of emergent property of the behaviour of the individual bees who themselves don't have the capacity to think at that level. The various aspects of colony behaviour have all been individually studied by quite a few people and groups, yes.replys1artibartfast 1 hour ago
| root | parent | next [–]
I think you are missing the point of the question, and it revolves around calling it a mind capable of decisions.replyAlecSchueler 39 minutes ago
| root | parent | next [–]
Am I? I just mentioned there's research that shows a colony of bees can make decisions that individual bees are incapable of. What am I misunderstanding?replylupire 3 hours ago

Why are they testing a whole brain instead of individual neurons? What is a brain if not the collective result of individual neurons?replyfolkrav 2 hours ago
| root | parent | next [–]
The comparison only works if the concept of a “hive mind” is as accepted and defined as the concept of a brain, which is quite literally what I was asking.replycollingreen 39 minutes ago
| root | parent | next [–]
"Hive mind" conjures ideas of an omnipresent, all-controlling intelligence to me like startrek's borg, but I think this is more about the idea of a "superorganism" [0] like some bees and most ants where the group exhibits traits and "behavior" and "decisions" as a whole, beyond the ability of any single, specialized individual. Less superintelligence and more emergent behavior and complexity.[0] https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superorganismreplyalex_suzuki 7 hours ago

Nitpick: the article mentions that the bees are tracked with QR Codes, but I find that hard to believe, given the space constraints. In one photo it looks like it is an ArUco marker.replydiggan 7 hours ago
| parent | next [–]
2mm QR codes according to the article:> The protocol used at Fukushima is automated. Each bee is equipped with a 2-mm-wide QR Code which is read by a camera, activating the opening of the maze.But yeah, doesn't look like a QR code at all, are there possibly different variations of QR codes? Haven't heard about that myself.replyblueflow 6 hours ago

I can imagine the journalist referring to all Matrix Codes as "QR".replywanderingstan 5 hours ago
| root | parent | next [–]
This is it. All matrix codes are now commonly referred to as “QR Codes”. I’ve noticed this especially at airports where both passengers and gate agents refer to the “QR codes” on boarding passes. (Which are IIRC Aztec codes)replyalex_suzuki 4 hours ago
| root | parent | next [–]
Boarding passes are typically Aztec, but don‘t have to be. IATA allows other types as well:

is a barcode a one-dimensional code?replycollingreen 37 minutes ago
| root | parent | next [–]
Yes - even though it obviously has visual height the data only runs in one dimension. For the 2D codes like QR the data is in both directions, which is why orientation often comes up in their design.replyChrisMarshallNY 4 hours ago

We have something similar in Barcelona (maybe entire Spain? Apparently called NaviLens, colored squares rather than triangles) all around public transit points. They're used for blind people to navigate the public transit system :)> As users sweep their environment with a smartphone, audio cues allow them to find and center the tag in the phone’s field of view. A shake of the wrist prompts the details contained within the tag to be read out (visually impaired people are often holding a guide dog or cane with their other hand). https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/06/06/135057/these-col...replyalex_suzuki 4 hours ago

Never saw one of those in the wild. But I have seen NaviLens codes (on cereal packaging), they use color as well:

Have we tried increasing cognition by selective breeding. Get mice best at maze to breed 100 descendants and repeat it few times, with varying food supply and survival difficulties.replygiraffe_lady 6 hours ago

This gets you mice that are better at navigating mazes. The connection between that and general cognition or learning capacity is not as robust as you would hope. Just as likely they simply have better peripheral vision or something.replyTraubenfuchs 7 hours ago
