Nitpick: the article mentions that the bees are tracked with QR Codes, but I find that hard to believe, given the space constraints. In one photo it looks like it is an ArUco marker.replynumpad0 51 minutes ago

TIL: Wikipedia does not have a standalone article for ArUco markers: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARTagreplydiggan 1 hour ago

2mm QR codes according to the article:> The protocol used at Fukushima is automated. Each bee is equipped with a 2-mm-wide QR Code which is read by a camera, activating the opening of the maze.But yeah, doesn't look like a QR code at all, are there possibly different variations of QR codes? Haven't heard about that myself.replyblueflow 54 minutes ago

Have we tried increasing cognition by selective breeding. Get mice best at maze to breed 100 descendants and repeat it few times, with varying food supply and survival difficulties.replygiraffe_lady 32 minutes ago

This gets you mice that are better at navigating mazes. The connection between that and general cognition or learning capacity is not as robust as you would hope. Just as likely they simply have better peripheral vision or something.replyTraubenfuchs 1 hour ago
