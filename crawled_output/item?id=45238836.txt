They only seem to be testing individual bees though, not the hive mind.replyfolkrav 2 minutes ago

Is there any scientific basis for some kind of shared collective thought I don’t know about? In other words, what’s the “hive mind” if not the collective result of individual minds?replyfhars 2 hours ago

Yeah. How could 1950's science fiction be so wrong?replycbdevidal 2 hours ago

Nitpick: the article mentions that the bees are tracked with QR Codes, but I find that hard to believe, given the space constraints. In one photo it looks like it is an ArUco marker.replydiggan 3 hours ago

2mm QR codes according to the article:> The protocol used at Fukushima is automated. Each bee is equipped with a 2-mm-wide QR Code which is read by a camera, activating the opening of the maze.But yeah, doesn't look like a QR code at all, are there possibly different variations of QR codes? Haven't heard about that myself.replyblueflow 2 hours ago

I can imagine the journalist referring to all Matrix Codes as "QR".replywanderingstan 1 hour ago
| root | parent | next [–]
This is it. All matrix codes are now commonly referred to as “QR Codes”. I’ve noticed this especially at airports where both passengers and gate agents refer to the “QR codes” on boarding passes. (Which are IIRC Aztec codes)replyalex_suzuki 51 minutes ago

Boarding passes are typically Aztec, but don‘t have to be. IATA allows other types as well:

Never saw one of those in the wild. But I have seen NaviLens codes (on cereal packaging), they use color as well:

There‘s MicroQR, which is just a single finder pattern of a regular QR code, with some adjoining data. But it doesn’t look like one.replynumpad0 2 hours ago

Nitpick: QR code is widely used as a generic term for matrix barcodes.replyThorrez 3 hours ago

I can see a direct relation in this test, but it may be my lack of imagination or knowdledge...Anyway, animals in islands without predators lose escape hability, in particular the dodo.replyIAmBroom 2 hours ago

Scientific research causes cancer in mice.That's actually a fact; there are specific bloodlines prone to cancers.replyblackoil 3 hours ago

Have we tried increasing cognition by selective breeding. Get mice best at maze to breed 100 descendants and repeat it few times, with varying food supply and survival difficulties.replygiraffe_lady 2 hours ago
| parent | next [–]
This gets you mice that are better at navigating mazes. The connection between that and general cognition or learning capacity is not as robust as you would hope. Just as likely they simply have better peripheral vision or something.replyTraubenfuchs 3 hours ago
