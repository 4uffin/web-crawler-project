They only seem to be testing individual bees though, not the hive mind.replyfhars 1 hour ago

Nitpick: the article mentions that the bees are tracked with QR Codes, but I find that hard to believe, given the space constraints. In one photo it looks like it is an ArUco marker.replytokai 3 minutes ago

Nitpick: QR code is widely used as a generic term for matrix barcodes.replynumpad0 1 hour ago

2mm QR codes according to the article:> The protocol used at Fukushima is automated. Each bee is equipped with a 2-mm-wide QR Code which is read by a camera, activating the opening of the maze.But yeah, doesn't look like a QR code at all, are there possibly different variations of QR codes? Haven't heard about that myself.replyblueflow 1 hour ago

I can imagine the journalist referring to all Matrix Codes as "QR".replywanderingstan 5 minutes ago
| root | parent | next [–]
This is it. All matrix codes are now commonly referred to as “QR Codes”. I’ve noticed this especially at airports where both passengers and gate agents refer to the “QR codes” on boarding passes. (Which are IIRC Aztec codes)replyThorrez 2 hours ago

I can see a direct relation in this test, but it may be my lack of imagination or knowdledge...Anyway, animals in islands without predators lose escape hability, in particular the dodo.replyIAmBroom 1 hour ago

Scientific research causes cancer in mice.That's actually a fact; there are specific bloodlines prone to cancers.replyblackoil 2 hours ago

Have we tried increasing cognition by selective breeding. Get mice best at maze to breed 100 descendants and repeat it few times, with varying food supply and survival difficulties.replygiraffe_lady 1 hour ago
| parent | next [–]
This gets you mice that are better at navigating mazes. The connection between that and general cognition or learning capacity is not as robust as you would hope. Just as likely they simply have better peripheral vision or something.replyTraubenfuchs 2 hours ago
