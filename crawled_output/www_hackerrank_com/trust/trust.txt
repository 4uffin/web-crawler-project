Trust at HackerRank
We are committed to ensuring a safe and secure experience for our users – so we leverage the most reliable and secure technology and processes to ensure your data is always protected.
Reliability
HackerRank is reliable to the core.
Built on industry-leading AWS infrastructure, HackerRank delivers optimal performance with geo-redundancy and rapid failover options around the world to ensure that you always have access to a highly available and resilient service. With AWS, we can quickly respond to increases in user load, allowing us to provide reliable, predictable performance that scales with business of all sizes.
Our service is supported by multiple, redundant data centers that deliver 99.9% service availability. We constantly monitor key measures such as load times, search responsiveness, attachments, and data delivery. Our performance dashboard provides users with a constant view into operational uptime.
Security
We deliver enterprise-grade protection.
We are committed to providing the highest levels of security to ensure that your most critical and sensitive data, applications, and infrastructure remain safe. The HackerRank platform is built on Amazon Web Services (AWS), a secure cloud services platform that complies with all major security standards including ISO 27001, SOC 1/SOC 2/SSAE 16/ISAE 3402.
HackerRank has implemented proactive security procedures, such as perimeter defense, network security monitoring, network intrusion prevention systems, and extensive policies and process controls. We engage third-party security experts to conduct independent internal and external network, system, and application vulnerability assessments. We provide end-to-end encryption of all customer data using 128-bit SSL encryption.
Visibility & Control
We provide total visibility and control.
HackerRank empowers your administrators with fine-grained role-based access controls to customize who has access to data and resources in HackerRank based on content, location, or device. We streamline authentication by providing single sign-on (SSO) capabilities via our SSO partners or your preferred SAML 2.0-compliant solution.
Our APIs automate repetitive tasks such as test administration and fetching results. Customers can use our APIs to generate dashboards, audit user actions, integrate with their HR systems, or leverage our pre-built integrations with the most popular Applicant Tracking Systems.
Privacy & Compliance
We provide privacy protection you can trust.
HackerRank's privacy program includes strict policies and procedures regarding access to and the use, disclosure, and transfer of customer data to ensure confidentiality of your data. We comply with the most widely accepted standards and regulations, validated by independent third-party audits, in order to help you meet your privacy obligations.
We comply with major global privacy standards, including ISO 27001, a globally recognized, standards-based approach to security, and the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). HackerRank has implemented numerous privacy and security practices to ensure we are fully compliant with GDPR and provide product functionality that enables our customers to remain compliant.
