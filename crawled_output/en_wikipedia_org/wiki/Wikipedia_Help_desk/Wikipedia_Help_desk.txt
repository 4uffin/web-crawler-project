Maejor[edit]
Maejor
Hi, I am not sure what is the right place to report this, but this article is unlikely to be OK. There is almost no reference, and it was extensively changed by one editor in the last few days: [1]. I deleted the lead image from Commons, as it is a copyright violation. Thanks for your attention. Yann (talk) 17:39, 7 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Well, major WP:SPA case, we can say that much:[2]. And there is a leadimage again. Gråbergs Gråa Sång (talk) 22:35, 7 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Yann, @Gråbergs Gråa Sång
Doesn't that article need some sources?
At least one source? David10244 (talk) 23:48, 7 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I deleted again all images uploaded by this user. I guess they will be blocked soon. Yann (talk) 18:57, 8 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Yann Fine, but I was asking about the article,
which has almost no inline sources in the prose. David10244 (talk) 05:49, 9 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Yes, it does need sources. Yann (talk) 16:18, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Need page patrol for new article: Arman Mnatsakanyan[edit]
Could a patroller please review the article Arman Mnatsakanyan?
It is a new biography with multiple reliable sources.
A review would help lift the noindex status so it can be indexed. Thank you! AnnaYerits (talk) 17:01, 9 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Do you have a particular need for the article to appear in search results quickly?
New Page Patrol is an entirely volunteer run process, we cannot guarantee a speedy review.
It would have been better if you had submitted it for a review as a draft instead of moving it yourself, especially as this is the first topic you've edited. 331dot (talk) 18:13, 9 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
One of the volunteers in the Wikipedia:New pages patrol will get to it when they can, or else it will be automatically made indexable after 90 days from creation. There is currently a backlog of over 12,000 articles – is there some special reason that Arman Mnatsakanyan should be able to 'jump the queue'?
You realise that a patroller might instead judge that the article does not yet meet Wikipedia's standards and delete or Draftify it rather than lifting the noindexing? {The poster formerly known as 87.81.230.195} 94.1.98.196 (talk) 18:15, 9 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Your article doesn't establish any notablity so is at risk of being sent to WP:AFD. Theroadislong (talk) 18:23, 9 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
As you were saying: Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Arman Mnatsakanyan.
@AnnaYerits: It's really bad form for a new editor to move an article from draft to mainspace without proper review. A good guide is to refrain from moving any drafts into mainspace until you can get one approved via WP:AFC, so that you can learn what a mainspace article requires. ~Anachronist (talk) 22:43, 9 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
"It's really bad form for a new editor to move an article from draft to mainspace without proper review". Nope. If that were not allowed, we would make it impossible for them to do so. As it is, once an account reaches a certain level of activity, we explicitly allow such moves, and using AfC becomes a purely optional process for such accounts. Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 10:45, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I didn't say it wasn't allowed, I said it's really bad form. And it is. It's even worse form for a new editor to move a draft into mainspace anyway after it's been declined, and I've seen that often, but not in this case.
It's a good idea to practice writing articles by submitting them for review until you can demonstrate that you're capable of writing something acceptable. This good practice isn't required, and often isn't followed. ~Anachronist (talk) 15:32, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I know what you said; I even quoted it. Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 15:58, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Audio translation[edit]
Hi! So can we use a recording of a Google audio translation? On the one hand, Google isn't CC-BY-SA, but on the other (perhaps) per WP:TRANSLATE "A translation is a derivative work", and mechanical? —Fortuna, imperatrix 12:00, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Fortuna imperatrix mundi: can you give a more specific example, i.e. what audio is being translated and how would the translated audio be used? There are two issues, firstly what is the copyright status of the original audio and secondly what are the terms of use of Google audio translation.
Thanks TSventon. My question(s) stem from this discussion. The text itself is 13th-century Latin, so there aren't any copyright concerns with it. But on the technical side, I'm not so sure! —Fortuna, imperatrix 15:24, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Fortuna imperatrix mundi: I think it is highly unlikely that audio generated by Google from a text would be freely usable for all purposes as required by Wikipedia. According to support.google.com, Translate service is governed by Google TOS; You can use the service for your own personal needs, not for commercial usage. TSventon (talk) 15:47, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Yes, I suspected as much... I wonder if there is an open-source option somewhere else. —Fortuna, imperatrix 17:08, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
You could always record yourself speaking the translation, and upload that. ~Anachronist (talk) 17:50, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Kmouth is a good option, though it is exclusive to GNU/Linux and possibly other UNIX systems mgjertson (talk) (contribs) 19:17, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Does Kmouth speak 13th-century Latin with an authentic pronunciation? TSventon (talk) 19:25, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Even if the original Latin is not in copyright there may be copyright in the translation. A translation by a nineteenth century translator-Robert Browning for instance will also be out of copyright but a translation written this year will be in copyright. The two translations will not be the same and the 2025 translatpr will be entitled to payment for his or her work. A machine translation will probably not be worth reading but there may be a copyright.A recording of a person reading the work whether in the in 13th century Latin or in English may well have its own copyright. I may be wrong but this is the law so far as I understand it.. Spinney Hill (talk) 22:11, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
What is this weird entry that showed up in my filter log?[edit]
What is this? I checked my filter log, and found a weird entry in the log. It said:
12:54, September 9, 2025: RaptorsFan2019 (talk · contribs) triggered an edit filter, performing the action "edit" on User talk:RaptorsFan2019/User warning sandbox. Actions taken: none; Filter description: LTA (long-term abuse) 1133
The edit that triggered the filter was actually just me experimenting with creating custom user warning templates in a sandbox. After I was unsuccessful with the experiment due to issues trying to set up templates and arrange the code, I gave up and requested deletion of the sandbox by tagging it with {{Db-u1}}, which removed the edit that triggered the filter. Don't worry, these edits were made in good faith. RaptorsFan2019 (talk) 14:40, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
We don't typically give out details of private filters, nor sanction people just because they hit one, but I will offer the explanation that your editing is highly unusual for an account which is 7 days old. Honestly, I'd have expected more filter hits. Anyway, false positives can happen. -- zzuuzz (talk) 14:56, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@RaptorsFan2019: There are public filters which can be seen by everybody and private filters which are hidden from most users to prevent them from seeing the filter conditions and work around them. This one is private so we are not giving details. Let me just say that LTA means long-term abuse so the filter was designed to look for patterns by a specific user. The filter doesn't block the edit and you don't have to worry about it. Nobody has ever mentioned my filter log which is a lot longer and has many public filters if you want to see examples of that. PrimeHunter (talk) 15:49, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Creating a new page for Dena Davida[edit]
Before beginning I would like to confirm that I am permitted to create this page, as I know this person professionally as an advisor for my artistic work. Maria Mantia Papathanasiou (talk) 15:48, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Maria Mantia Papathanasiou You should formally disclose a conflict of interest on your user page; you are permitted to create and submit a draft via Articles for Creation.
Writing a new article is the most difficult task to perform on Wikipedia, and it is even harder with a conflict of interest.
It is highly recommended that you not dive right in to creating articles, and instead first gain experience and knowledge by editing existing articles as well as using the new user tutorial.
To succeed, you need to set aside everything you know about this person, everything their associates say about them, all materials from the person, and limit yourself to summarizing what independent reliable sources choose on their own to say about them.
You need to show that they meet the definition of a notable person broadly, or a notable artist narrowly. 331dot (talk) 15:52, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Thank you for the answer. May I use the subject's website? Maria Mantia Papathanasiou (talk) 16:00, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Also, if I create an initial page that is not too elaborate, might the subject be then allowed to edit and add to it? Or is this also "not reliable"? Maria Mantia Papathanasiou (talk) 16:07, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The subject's own website is not an independent source.
Please see WP:42 for a metric you may use to evaluate sources.
The person themselves should review the autobiography policy.
They should avoid directly editing any article about themselves in most cases, but they may propose edits in the form of an edit request to (this so far hypothetical) article about them. 331dot (talk) 16:09, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
It depends on what it's used for. If it's used to back up basic things such as name or date of birth, It's allowed as per WP:ABOUTSELF mgjertson (talk) (contribs) 19:22, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The subject may not be a reliable source for date of birth; there's over a century of history of cinema performers, in particular, falsifying DOB in order to fake an age. --Orange Mike | Talk 22:14, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Assistance with Edits and Publishing an Article[edit]
I recently made some edits to a write-up on my Wikipedia page, but most of those edits were removed. I would like to understand why this happened and how I can make improvements that comply with Wikipedia’s guidelines.
In addition, I have already written an article on my user page and would like to know the correct process for publishing it into the main encyclopedia. Could you please guide me on the proper steps to follow?
Thank you for your time and assistance.
Here is the article link: User:Prince Kayode Oyetunde Bayewuwon. Prince Kayode Oyetunde Bayewuwon (talk) 18:29, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The whole url is not needed when linking, I fixed this for you.
You have edited your user page, which is not article space.(note the "User:" in the title) It is a place for the account operator to tell about themselves as a Wikipedia user, not anything and everything about themselves. New accounts cannot directly create articles and need to use Articles for creation to create and submit a draft.
Writing about yourself is highly discouraged, please see the autobiography policy. Your text cites no sources. A Wikipedia article must summarize what independent reliable sources with significant coverage have chosen on their own to say about the topic, not what the topic or its associates say about it. It needs to be shown how the person is a notable person. You are not a notable politician as you do not hold public office or have not won election to public office. 331dot (talk) 18:36, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Did you take the image of yourself? It appears to be professionally taken, in which case the copyright belongs to the photographer and is not yours to release. If the photographer assigned you the copyright, you need to go to Commons and work with the editors there to indicate that. 331dot (talk) 18:38, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@331dot, @Prince Kayode Oyetunde Bayewuwon The the upload comment on the file says "Uploaded a work by Kayode..." which is confusing... David10244 (talk) 01:06, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Yeah, I saw that too- it is confusing. 331dot (talk) 08:30, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
"Noteworthy"[edit]
The Daily Vault (www.dailyvault.com) is a music review website with over 11,000 reviews completed over the past 28 years. It is cited as a source in more than 8,000 Wikipedia articles. And yet there is no entry for it on Wikipedia, and my understanding is that when one was proposed in the past, the site was dismissed as "not noteworthy." This seems inconsistent with the facts. Burgher25 (talk) 20:06, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
hello @Burgher25.
Notability and reliability are completely separate concepts. There are certainly many sources which are notable without being reliable (for example, iMDB and the Daily Mail); and it is no surprise that there might be reliable sources which are not themselves notable.
Notability is basically about whether there is enough independent
reliably published material about a subject to base an article on; Reliability is about whether the source has an editorial policy that encourages fastfact checking and responsible publishing.
The Daily Vault only seems to have been discussed once in the archives of WP:RS, in 2009, and the discussion was not conclusive, so arguably it should not be cited. But that has no bearing on whether it not it is notable. If the sources exist, then somebody could write an article about it. ColinFine (talk) 21:31, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@ColinFine
I'm sure you mean "fact checking". David10244 (talk) 01:09, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
David10244: You're right of course. Corrected. Thanks. --ColinFine (talk) 09:02, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Burgher25: The Daily Vault is not cited in more than 8,000 articles. I guess you did a search on Daily Vault without quotation marks. This gives 8,471 results but like most search engines, it returns pages which contain each word somewhere. The vast majority are irrelevant hits. "Daily Vault" with quotation marks searches the words together and only gives 346 results. insource:"dailyvault.com" gives 348. PrimeHunter (talk) 11:20, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Duplicate references, one of them being transcluded[edit]
In the page Suicide methods, two references are duplicated with the DOI doi:10.101/j.aap.2015.04.012. However, one of these comes from a section transclusion from Rail suicide. How best should I resolve this? I don't want the article to break if the ref is removed from the transcluded article. Is it customary in this case to use template syntax in the transcluded article and wrap the offending reference in {{{1|reference code...}}}, and would that even work? Thanks, OutsideNormality (talk) 22:42, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Use a named reference in both articles and manage the citation centrally to avoid duplication Editor1769 09:00, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Referencing errors on Louisiana (1984 film)[edit]
Reference help requested.
Thanks, RupertNY245 (talk) 00:22, 11 September 2025 (UTC)
Don't know what you mean[reply]
Hello @RupertNY245, could you clarify your question? GoldRomean (talk) 03:50, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hello, @RupertNY245. "9/10/2025" is not an acceptable date format (probably because it is ambiguous - where I live, it means 9th October, not 10th September). See WP:Date#Consistency. ColinFine (talk) 09:09, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
You did not add a title to your reference, instead putting the title incorrectly in the "last1" parameter. However, there is a bigger problem, and that is that you have only cited a random eBay listing's image, which is not a reliable source as it is user-generated. See Wikipedia:Reliable sources. Someone reverted your edits for this reason; see the page history. OutsideNormality (talk) 01:14, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
No English Page available for Gopal Patha[edit]
Why there is no page available for Mr Gopal Chandra Mukherjee (Gopal Patha) in Wikipedia, he is hero of Direct action day happened in Bengal in 1946, he should get a dignified page on Wikipedia
please consider my request
Regards
Rajeev Agrawal Raj wip (talk) 05:00, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
There was briefly an article about Gopal Chandra Mukherjee, but it was deleted as an unauthorized resuscitation of an article deleted as the result of WP:AfD/Gopal Chandra Mukhopadhyay. That AfD was closed as "delete" by Joyous!. An "extended confirmed" user believing (i) that Gopal Chandra Mukherjee is notable and (ii) that they (the user) are capable of creating a draft that (a) demonstrates this and (b) is a neutral account of his life would be able to make a fresh start at Draft:Gopal Chandra Mukherjee and to submit this for promotion to article status. This would require the approval of Joyous! and is unlikely to be an easy task. -- Hoary (talk) 08:31, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
No dedicated article exists in the English Wikipedia due to its deletion in February 2023 after an Articles for Deletion discussion. Editors cited insufficient significant coverage in reliable, independent sources and reliance on partisan ones, failing WP:GNG. He is briefly noted in the Direct Action Day article for his defensive efforts. Editor1769 08:52, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hello, @Raj wip. The criterion for whether there could be an article about somebody is what Wikipedia calls notability - which isn't quite the same as what people usually mean by the word. It's not about being important, or famous, or popular, or influentia.: it's about whether there is enough published information about the person to base an article on (remembering that Wikipedia has little interest in what the subject of an article says or wants to say about themselves, or what their associates say about them. Wikipedia is almost exclusively interested in what people who have no connection with the subject, and who have not been prompted or fed information on behalf of the subject, have chosen to publish about the subject in reliable sources. If enough material is cited from independent sources to establish notability, a limited amount of uncontroversial factual information may be added from non-independent sources. )
As others have said, if there is enough independent reliably published material to base an article on, then somebody could write one. But there isn't some sort of editorial board that you can address request to, as you have tried to do above. (Well, there is a page called requested articles, but requests there hardly ever get picked up). This is a volunteer project, where people work on what they choose. ColinFine (talk) 09:17, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Quoting single sources that merely repeat factual statements by others[edit]
I've been an editor for about 3 years now, but I've noticed some editors reverting or downplaying what I have written based on only a single source being used to note something. This is despite the fact said source accurately quotes the individual it is reporting on.
For instance, Michael Parenti, a political scientist, denied the existence of genocide in Bosnia in the 1990s in the 2000 volume of Project Censored, as well as the number of victims at Srebrenica. Despite this, the website Balkan Witness, who accurately noted that Parenti had said these things, with URLs as proof, the statements were then attributed, rather than being kept as fact.
Similarly, Sara Flounders, who in a 1995 article denied Serbian atrocities in the Bosnian War, was instead only written to be accused of doing so in a statement attributed to Pulse Media, which linked her denial.
Craig Murray, who as shown by OSINT for Ukraine had promoted Russian propaganda regarding the alleged genocide in the Donbass and that Euromaidan was a coup, was reverted based on the biases of the website, despite presenting a screenshot of his blog.
I don't understand why things like these happen, although I will note that all three of these examples are self described left-wing personalities, which I think might be a problem of bias on this website.
What are other editors opinions on this? Is a single biased source accurately reporting on a documented fact not sufficient for articles on living people? JPHC2003 (talk) 08:14, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Contentious material requires high-quality, reliable sources WP:BLP, and WP:DUE emphasises that a single source may not establish sufficient weight for such claims, even if it accurately quotes the subject. The sources used seem verifiable but may be seen as non-independent or advocacy-based, which WP:RS cautions against for BLPs without corroboration.
I propose citing the primary source directly to confirm the quote, supplemented by any additional reliable secondary sources. This aligns with WP:PRIMARY for direct statements while meeting WP:VERIFY. If the source’s reliability is disputed, we can discuss it at WP:RSN or seek consensus on the article’s talk page.

October 2022 German railway attack[edit]
October 2022 German railway attack
Hi,
this incident (rail traffic outage due to communications outage) ultimately was found to be not deliberate sabotage but the unfortunate occurrence of two cases of attempted copper cable theft at about the same time and in just the right/wrong places, according to de:GSM-R-Ausfall bei der Deutschen Bahn am 8. Oktober 2022 and the references given there. I'd like to update the English version to reflect that, but need some guidance.
- Does this re-framing change the notability of the event, as far as the English article is concerned? Should there be a new AfD?
- Because of the months- or years-long time gap from the indicent, the later findings were barely deemed newsworthy even in Germany, so there may well be no English RSs to reference. Is that a problem?
- The page title would need to be changed, clearly. Should the new one be a direct translation of the new German one, or is that too clunky?
Thanks,
- 2A02:560:4D22:8700:F4FE:FCB:26FB:9AD (talk) 10:26, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Sources do not have to be in English, they are just preferred when available. As for the notability of the event: imho, as WP:GNG was given then, it is still given now. Lectonar (talk) 11:22, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
As for the title...something like October 2022 German railway incident or such might be ok, but that would be a question for article talk I think. Lectonar (talk) 11:31, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

You should discuss issues with an article on its associated talk page, in this case, Talk:Suicide methods. However, its outright removal is extremely unlikely, as Wikipedia is not censored for any reason. The topic is a legitimate effort to summarize with a neutral point of view what independent reliable sources choose to say about the topic. 331dot (talk) 16:14, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Our company's page[edit]
Someone else has a closed connection to our company's page
Hello,
I am the Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) of iMusician Digital, and I am disclosing this conflict of interest (COI) openly.
The article about our company already exists on French Wikipedia (fr:IMusician Digital).
I would like to improve and expand it with independent, neutral sources.
However, it seems that someone closely connected to the page is preventing edits or reverting changes.
As a COI editor, I understand I should not directly make promotional edits myself.
I would therefore like guidance on the proper way forward:
Should I propose suggested changes on the article’s Talk page in French?
Or would it be better to prepare a draft (in English or French) and ask uninvolved editors to review it?
My goal is simply to ensure that the French Wikipedia article is accurate, neutral, and properly sourced.
Could an uninvolved editor please advise on next steps, or assist in reviewing the draft I have prepared?
Thank you for your time and assistance. Breno iM (talk) 16:18, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The French Wikipedia is a separate project from the English Wikipedia, with its own policies, you should discuss your issue there. 331dot (talk) 16:22, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
If you wish to edit here, you will need to formally disclose your status as an employee, please see WP:PAID. 331dot (talk) 16:23, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hello, @Breno iM. I can't speak for French Wikipedia, which is a different project, with its own policies.
But as regards the English Wikipedia, it's not enough to be "accurate, neutral, and properly sourced" (or, rather, it is enough, but most people who are not well-versed in English Wikipedia's policies usually misunderstand "properly sourced").
Wikipedia has little interest in what the subject of an article says or wants to say about themselves, or what their associates say about them. Wikipedia is almost exclusively interested in what people who have no connection with the subject, and who have not been prompted or fed information on behalf of the subject, have chosen to publish about the subject in reliable sources. If enough material is cited from independent sources to establish notability, a limited amount of uncontroversial factual information may be added from non-independent sources.
So unless most of the sources are completely independent of the subject, the article will not be acceptable. See WP:42.
My earnest advice to new editors is to not even think about
trying to create an article until you have spent several weeks - at least - learning about how Wikipedia works by making improvements to existing articles. Once you have understood core policies such as verifiability, neutral point of view, reliable, independent sources, and notability, and experienced how we handle disagreements with other editors (the Bold, Revert, Discuss cycle), then you might be ready to read your first article carefully, and try creating a draft. If you don't follow this advice but try to create an article without this preparation, you are likely to have a frustrating and disappointing experience with Wikipedia. And that is even without a conflict of interest. ColinFine (talk) 22:20, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
"Should I propose suggested changes on the article’s Talk page in French?" Yes; or, in case you don't speak French, you may do so in English at fr:Wikipédia:Bistro des non-francophones.
Either way, you need first to state in your French-Wikipedia userpage who you work for. Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 16:13, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Name of an new wiki page[edit]
Hi, I am planning to create a new Wikipedia article about Diella , an AI virtual assistant developed in Albania that in 2025 was appointed as the country’s first AI “virtual minister” in public procurements, also first AI virtualy minister in the world.
Could you please advise:
Is the title "Diella (virtual minister)" appropriate? or other name?
Is the article structure (Infobox officeholder, lead, background, ministerial role) correct for a software/AI system with governmental functions?
Thank you, i welcome your suggestions.
Lanceloth345 (talk) 10:47, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Lanceloth345 As you know, Diella is currently a small article about a village and that has a hatnote to the main eAlbania article where the AI assistant is described. Neither articles are currently very large and I would have thought that expansion of eAlbania is the correct way to go. If you have many new sources and feel that the AI assistant is more likely to be what readers will be seeking when they search for "Diella", then you could switch the hatnote to be the other way round, giving the AI as the WP:MAINTOPIC. Mike Turnbull (talk) 11:03, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I understand, but since yesterday it has global media coverage also as first Ai Virtual Minister in the world some of sources are provided in current article alsoz this "intrigued" me to create an separate dedicated article.

Notability issue for Leonisa[edit]
I’m a declared paid editor working on behalf of Leonisa. The current article has a notability tag and a new tag for nomination of deletion. I have prepared a sandbox draft with significant independent sources including Forbes, El Tiempo, INSEAD, and The Best of Intima. These demonstrate coverage in multiple independent, reliable outlets. I believe this addresses notability concerns. Please see here: User:Leonisa3/sandbox.

El Niño event renames[edit]
The renaming of the pages back to 1988-1990 La Niña event and back to 1991-1994 El Niño events, though with en dash and not with the hyphen
I'm having some serious troubles trying to prove for the fact the La Niña event that started in 1988 lasted up until the very first halves of 1990 and the fact El Niño events, three of them for exact, didn't really begin until Spring 1991 and didn't end until the late meteorological Summer in 1994-following which ENSO-Neutral periods dominated the period between Autumn 1994 until Spring 1995-at which latter time a weak La Niña event started to develop. I would rather comment on the content than the people who refuse to accept the references I was using, although they say these references are inaccurate and inappropriate (I'm talking the references I was using).

trying to replace an infobox photo.[edit]
The infobox photo that I uploaded to Robert I. Misbim page is a selfie by Dr. Misbin, but the page keeps disappearing.
I think I (the page editor) have 3 problems:
1. Something has to be sent to Dr. Misbin to verify that he took the photo as a selfie, but I don't know the procedure for that.
2. Something must be put somewhere to tell editors that we are in the process of authentifying the photo -- but I don't what this process is.
3. I erroneously listed the date of the photo as in August 2025.
How do I change to the correct date, Nov. 29, 2022?

Shanthophile, your title is Referencing errors on [[Special:Diff/1295625433|Social Repose]]. It seems that you're asking not about the article as a whole but instead about a slingle diff. This adds {{cite web |url=https://www.nataliezworld.com/2014/09/blood-on-dance-floor-announces.html |website=https://www.nataliezworld.com}} which, contrary to what you seem to be saying, lacks the title attribute. (You've specified the title of the website but not that of the particular page.) As for the article as a whole, this has a vast number (currently 490) of what are presented as references, but many of which merely point to where (on Youtube, etc) one may find this or that song.

TinyNny (talk) 01:09, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I'm assuming the logo you want to replace is the picture used on this page. Whether it is or not, you should consider this:
There is a concept in copyright law called threshold of originality (Wikimedia Commons: c:Threshold of originality) which says that some logos are too simple to be eligible for copyright, but this threshold varies country by country. If it's below the threshold you can use a copyright tag like {{PD-ineligible}} or {{PD-textlogo}} when uploading. However, I'm not sure if the logo is below the threshold of originality, so you might be better asking at c:Commons:Village pump/Copyright since the people there are more experienced with copyright.
If it turns out to be above the threshold of originality, it has to be uploaded locally on Wikipedia under fair use, see Wikipedia:Non-free content for that, but keep in mind that requirements to upload non-free content is quite strict, and may be rejected if requirements are not met.

@ColinFine: Wild guess: The IP presumes that we are one of those websites (pretty common tbh) were you get a limited number of appeals (common are 1 or 1.5) after wich you are - short of being friends with the site owner or similar back door stuff - simply screwed. @IP You can always make another appeal, at least after a while and a good read of WP:GAB, wether via talkpage or WP:UTRS.

I think that for the second question, it doesn't matter whether the username contains the editors' real name or not, they get the same response regarding where to appeal.

jobs could type wikipedia.org/user:SURNU to see if they vnadalized wikipedia 223.24.191.47 (talk) 02:44, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Will you offer exceptions for not allowing blocked usernames to rename or vanish like digital footprint 223.24.191.47 (talk) 03:38, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
No. If someone doesn't want to be seen as acting a certain way, then they shouldn't act that way. There is an explicit notice about presumed permanence of all edits and giving up certain rights when publishing any text on this website. We are not in the business of helping create non-authentic reputations. DMacks (talk) 05:59, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
what if they were immature when they vnadalized, regretted vandalism, and their appeals got rejected anyways 49.237.20.174 (talk) 08:38, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
They they should live with that and move on to something else. Actions have consequences. 331dot (talk) 08:41, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
if jobs found out about the wikipedia account with irl name that vandalized wikipedia they should aplogize but not appeal if their appeals got rejected? 49.237.20.174 (talk) 08:59, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I get the sense that you are talking about yourself? If so, you are evading your block by posting here and making it harder to be unblocked later. We're willing to forgive and move past immature activities, but if you have no intentions of editing again, there's no need to do anything with your account as blocks only prevent editing. Again, actions have consequences. Feel free to tell your employer/potential employers that your past immaturity does not reflect who you are now. 331dot (talk) 09:14, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
im not talking about myself but will you also unblock sockpuppets
if john davis is sockpuppet of mack davis and mack davis got unblocked will you unblock john davis 49.237.20.174 (talk) 09:52, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Page redirected[edit]
Hi my personal page for Lazaros Kalemis is being redirected to my companies page Simpay US. I tried to find the original page to request someone to droete the redirect command. I cannot get yo the talk page to list the request. Can someone delete the redirect 100.11.17.87 (talk) 12:18, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The page was redirected by User:Curb Safe Charmer, because they felt that as a topic, you did not meet the requirements described at WP:NBUSINESSPERSON. I am inclined to agree.
If you disagree, on what basis?
Did you pay someone to write that about you? And about your company? Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 14:00, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Erika Kirk[edit]
I could not find a place on your webpage where I could express concerns. Please forward to the appropriate persons.
I am really assuming it is fake news from the unreliable right wingers, but when I heard that Wikipedia was considering removing Erika Kirk's biography was Wikipedia, I thought that it was in extremely poor taste and utterly poor timing. If she warranted a biography before his assassination, then why remove it now? It is inflamatory, sexist, and politically motivated. I thought Wikipedia was above such things. I definitely did not agree with everything Charlie Kirk said or believed, but he was courageous to go onto college campuses to provide an alternative opinion. Colleges must be a place where diverse opinions can be discussed and considered. Erika Kirk is planning to carry on his legacy, and it is way too early for a decision to delete her. I faithfully supported Wikipedia financially. If Wikipedia stoops this low, I will have to reconsider my support and my encouragement of my friends to continue their support. If this is fake news, get in front of this distasteful attempt by right winger antagonists to discredit your important website.

Hello @Nelson Huseby. You can view the deletion discussion for the Erika Kirk article at Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Erika Kirk. From the current consensus, it looks like the article will not be deleted. Please note deletion discussions on Wikipedia are not a majority vote, but instead a nuanced discussion among Wikipedia contributors. qcne (talk) 19:29, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I really hope the right person closes that. Quite a lot of votes in there shouldn't be counted because they are mere opinions with no justification. Electricmemory (talk) 20:01, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The discussion has obviously been canvassed off-Wiki. qcne (talk) 20:08, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
That's what I'm saying. Whoever goes and closes it eventually better be someone who knows what they're doing or a deletion review will come up, and the whole discussion will drag on for even longer. Electricmemory (talk) 21:17, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I's very likely an experienced admin will take it on. There may be challenges etc anyway, but that day, that sorrow. Gråbergs Gråa Sång (talk) 08:02, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Nelson Huseby: Erika Kirk's biography was started after the shooting of Charlie Kirk.[8] Special:Statistics says Wikipedia has more than 100,000 active registered users. Anyone can nominate an article for deletion and create a discussion about it. Her biography is unlikely to actually be deleted. PrimeHunter (talk) 19:53, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Donation debited twice[edit]

Page Update Suggested[edit]
Here is an update for Citation #11 on the "Self-Image" page:
Self-image#cite note-11
This is the correct citation:
Walker, Jeffrey M. (2004) "Squid-heads and Coppertops: Discursive Power in the Postmodern Filmic Dystopia"; Literature and Psychology, 49(4), 43-81 97.120.99.91 (talk) 20:30, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hello, IP user. You're welcome to go in and correct it yourself, if you feel able (note that the section you'll need to edit is the section where the reference is cited (Residual) not the section where it actually appears (References).
If you don't feel confident in doing that, then the article's talk page Talk:self-image is the best place to suggest it. ColinFine (talk) 21:48, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Wiki-buddy needed[edit]
I am having visual problems which make it difficult for me to edit. I can still provide text and even insert it at the correct spot. However, I would welcome a wiki-buddy to sort out problems with references and other more technical aspects of editing. I'm sure I am not the first to be in this position. Is there a mechanism for such help?

Maldivian dictators category[edit]
I recently nominated the category Maldivian Dictators for deletion and an overwhelming consensus was reached to delete it. I found that the category hasn't been deleted and I figured I'd ask here because I've never encountered this before. UnilandofmaTalk 10:31, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Unilandofma: I think the closer @GoldRomean: didn't do the close properly. There is a similar request on their talkpage from earlier today. TSventon (talk) 10:49, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
That would make sense yeah. UnilandofmaTalk 10:54, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Unilandofma and GoldRomean: actually the closure is listed at Wikipedia talk:Categories for discussion/Working#Non-admin closure requests (12 September 2025), but has not yet been actioned. TSventon (talk) 11:03, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
^ what TSventon said. There's a slight backlog, so it might take a bit for an admin to get to it. That being said, I do make mistakes sometimes, so if it hasn't been actioned and isn't listed at WT:CFDW feel free to come yell at me on my talk page :D. GoldRomean (talk) 18:10, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@GoldRomean: from a conversation on your talk page, I think you wrongly removed the AfD template from Category:Maldivian dictators. TSventon (talk) 18:17, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Thanks. Fixed. GoldRomean (talk) 18:22, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Game theorists: sub-categorisation[edit]
At present the Category:Game theorists category has two sub-categories Category:American game theorists and Category:Combinatorial game theorists Can other sub-categories be added for game theorists from other countries and for other game theorists working in other application areas?

Charlie Kirk[edit]
Why does't the Charlie Kirk page speak the truth about his death; he was assassinated not merely killed by a "gunshot".
Fix it!!!! 2600:6C47:A100:3C26:EA35:29F7:874D:1B52 (talk) 16:52, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Demands to "fix it" by random IPs carry little weight. Please discuss any concerns you have with the article at Talk:Killing of Charlie Kirk. Please review the discussions that already exist there, and express your concerns in a civil manner there. 331dot (talk) 16:58, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
In fact, the FAQ at the top of the page addresses your very question. 331dot (talk) 16:58, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
There is an extensive discussion occurring on the talk page regarding moving the article to Assassination of Charlie Kirk rather than Killing of Charlie Kirk, where it is now.
I would encourage you to read the discussion to better understand the issues. ~ ONUnicorn(Talk|Contribs)problem solving 16:59, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Charlie Kirk[edit]
hello I was looking at Charlie Kirk wiki info and the beginning should be changed to Founder not “co-founder”. Also cause of death should be assassination
or assassination by gunshot. Under Movement, “trumpism” should be removed as it’s not a thing and Charlie Kirk has never identified with “trumpism”. OnlyTruthShallSetYouFree (talk) 19:34, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
These are all article related issues, so they should be raised at Talk:Charlie Kirk.--♦IanMacM♦ (talk to me) 19:39, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
(edit conflict) Hi OnlyTruthShallSetYouFree! The article's talk page is the location that you'd typically go to in order to discuss things like this. However, the talk page is currently semi-protected due to being the target of a high number of disruptive edits. You'll need to wait until your account becomes autoconfirmed before you can edit there. This happens once your account reaches four days in age and after you've made at least 10 edits to Wikipedia. After your account become autoconfirmed, you'll be able to add your input and thoughts to the page. Please let us know if you have any more questions, and we'll be happy to answer them and help you. :-) Best - ~Oshwah~(talk) (contribs) 19:40, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

@OnlyTruthShallSetYouFree: The debate over whether to use the term "Assassination" is more-or-less being debated at Talk:Killing of Charlie Kirk#Requested move 11 September 2025; I don't doubt the article text will be edited once that debate concludes if a consensus emerges to use "assassination". —Jéské Couriano v^_^v threads critiques 19:56, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
