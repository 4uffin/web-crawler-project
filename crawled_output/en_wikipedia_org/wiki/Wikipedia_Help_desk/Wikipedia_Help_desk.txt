Maejor[edit]
Maejor
Hi, I am not sure what is the right place to report this, but this article is unlikely to be OK. There is almost no reference, and it was extensively changed by one editor in the last few days: [1]. I deleted the lead image from Commons, as it is a copyright violation. Thanks for your attention. Yann (talk) 17:39, 7 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Well, major WP:SPA case, we can say that much:[2]. And there is a leadimage again. Gråbergs Gråa Sång (talk) 22:35, 7 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Yann, @Gråbergs Gråa Sång
Doesn't that article need some sources?
At least one source? David10244 (talk) 23:48, 7 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I deleted again all images uploaded by this user. I guess they will be blocked soon. Yann (talk) 18:57, 8 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Yann Fine, but I was asking about the article,
which has almost no inline sources in the prose. David10244 (talk) 05:49, 9 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Yes, it does need sources. Yann (talk) 16:18, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Creating a new page for Dena Davida[edit]
Before beginning I would like to confirm that I am permitted to create this page, as I know this person professionally as an advisor for my artistic work. Maria Mantia Papathanasiou (talk) 15:48, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Maria Mantia Papathanasiou You should formally disclose a conflict of interest on your user page; you are permitted to create and submit a draft via Articles for Creation.
Writing a new article is the most difficult task to perform on Wikipedia, and it is even harder with a conflict of interest.
It is highly recommended that you not dive right in to creating articles, and instead first gain experience and knowledge by editing existing articles as well as using the new user tutorial.
To succeed, you need to set aside everything you know about this person, everything their associates say about them, all materials from the person, and limit yourself to summarizing what independent reliable sources choose on their own to say about them.
You need to show that they meet the definition of a notable person broadly, or a notable artist narrowly. 331dot (talk) 15:52, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Thank you for the answer. May I use the subject's website? Maria Mantia Papathanasiou (talk) 16:00, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Also, if I create an initial page that is not too elaborate, might the subject be then allowed to edit and add to it? Or is this also "not reliable"? Maria Mantia Papathanasiou (talk) 16:07, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The subject's own website is not an independent source.
Please see WP:42 for a metric you may use to evaluate sources.
The person themselves should review the autobiography policy.
They should avoid directly editing any article about themselves in most cases, but they may propose edits in the form of an edit request to (this so far hypothetical) article about them. 331dot (talk) 16:09, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
It depends on what it's used for. If it's used to back up basic things such as name or date of birth, It's allowed as per WP:ABOUTSELF mgjertson (talk) (contribs) 19:22, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The subject may not be a reliable source for date of birth; there's over a century of history of cinema performers, in particular, falsifying DOB in order to fake an age. --Orange Mike | Talk 22:14, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Referencing errors on Louisiana (1984 film)[edit]
Reference help requested.
Thanks, RupertNY245 (talk) 00:22, 11 September 2025 (UTC)
Don't know what you mean[reply]
Hello @RupertNY245, could you clarify your question? GoldRomean (talk) 03:50, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hello, @RupertNY245. "9/10/2025" is not an acceptable date format (probably because it is ambiguous - where I live, it means 9th October, not 10th September). See WP:Date#Consistency. ColinFine (talk) 09:09, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
You did not add a title to your reference, instead putting the title incorrectly in the "last1" parameter. However, there is a bigger problem, and that is that you have only cited a random eBay listing's image, which is not a reliable source as it is user-generated. See Wikipedia:Reliable sources. Someone reverted your edits for this reason; see the page history. OutsideNormality (talk) 01:14, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Remove this page[edit]
Can you remove this page? It indirectly impacts people with mental weakness.
Suicide methods.2603:8080:CA06:FE40:C199:37:D760:AC65 (talk) 16:10, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
You should discuss issues with an article on its associated talk page, in this case, Talk:Suicide methods. However, its outright removal is extremely unlikely, as Wikipedia is not censored for any reason. The topic is a legitimate effort to summarize with a neutral point of view what independent reliable sources choose to say about the topic. 331dot (talk) 16:14, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Our company's page[edit]
Someone else has a closed connection to our company's page
Hello,
I am the Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) of iMusician Digital, and I am disclosing this conflict of interest (COI) openly.
The article about our company already exists on French Wikipedia (fr:IMusician Digital).
I would like to improve and expand it with independent, neutral sources.
However, it seems that someone closely connected to the page is preventing edits or reverting changes.
As a COI editor, I understand I should not directly make promotional edits myself.
I would therefore like guidance on the proper way forward:
Should I propose suggested changes on the article’s Talk page in French?
Or would it be better to prepare a draft (in English or French) and ask uninvolved editors to review it?
My goal is simply to ensure that the French Wikipedia article is accurate, neutral, and properly sourced.
Could an uninvolved editor please advise on next steps, or assist in reviewing the draft I have prepared?
Thank you for your time and assistance. Breno iM (talk) 16:18, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The French Wikipedia is a separate project from the English Wikipedia, with its own policies, you should discuss your issue there. 331dot (talk) 16:22, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
If you wish to edit here, you will need to formally disclose your status as an employee, please see WP:PAID. 331dot (talk) 16:23, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hello, @Breno iM. I can't speak for French Wikipedia, which is a different project, with its own policies.
But as regards the English Wikipedia, it's not enough to be "accurate, neutral, and properly sourced" (or, rather, it is enough, but most people who are not well-versed in English Wikipedia's policies usually misunderstand "properly sourced").
Wikipedia has little interest in what the subject of an article says or wants to say about themselves, or what their associates say about them. Wikipedia is almost exclusively interested in what people who have no connection with the subject, and who have not been prompted or fed information on behalf of the subject, have chosen to publish about the subject in reliable sources. If enough material is cited from independent sources to establish notability, a limited amount of uncontroversial factual information may be added from non-independent sources.
So unless most of the sources are completely independent of the subject, the article will not be acceptable. See WP:42.
My earnest advice to new editors is to not even think about
trying to create an article until you have spent several weeks - at least - learning about how Wikipedia works by making improvements to existing articles. Once you have understood core policies such as verifiability, neutral point of view, reliable, independent sources, and notability, and experienced how we handle disagreements with other editors (the Bold, Revert, Discuss cycle), then you might be ready to read your first article carefully, and try creating a draft. If you don't follow this advice but try to create an article without this preparation, you are likely to have a frustrating and disappointing experience with Wikipedia. And that is even without a conflict of interest. ColinFine (talk) 22:20, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
"Should I propose suggested changes on the article’s Talk page in French?" Yes; or, in case you don't speak French, you may do so in English at fr:Wikipédia:Bistro des non-francophones.
Either way, you need first to state in your French-Wikipedia userpage who you work for. Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 16:13, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Draft:A.L. Kekin Gymnasium[edit]
review lasts too long - please check it
Hello. I created the Draft page: Draft:A.L. Kekin Gymnasium.
First time it was rejected cause of insufficient amount of inline citations. I fixed it immediatelly. Please review it cause it lasts too long, more that 8 weeks. Sportsmentos (talk) 08:27, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
You submitted the draft on August 4. As the header says "Review waiting, please be patient. This may take 8 weeks or more, since drafts are reviewed in no specific order. There are 2,373 pending submissions waiting for review." Meters (talk) 08:32, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hi @Sportsmentos. We have a limited amount of volunteer reviewers, and even less who can speak Russian.
It might be helpful for you to list here what the three strongest sources are that cover the history of this building in significant detail? qcne (talk) 09:12, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Name of an new wiki page[edit]
Hi, I am planning to create a new Wikipedia article about Diella , an AI virtual assistant developed in Albania that in 2025 was appointed as the country’s first AI “virtual minister” in public procurements, also first AI virtualy minister in the world.
Could you please advise:
Is the title "Diella (virtual minister)" appropriate? or other name?
Is the article structure (Infobox officeholder, lead, background, ministerial role) correct for a software/AI system with governmental functions?
Thank you, i welcome your suggestions.
Lanceloth345 (talk) 10:47, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Lanceloth345 As you know, Diella is currently a small article about a village and that has a hatnote to the main eAlbania article where the AI assistant is described. Neither articles are currently very large and I would have thought that expansion of eAlbania is the correct way to go. If you have many new sources and feel that the AI assistant is more likely to be what readers will be seeking when they search for "Diella", then you could switch the hatnote to be the other way round, giving the AI as the WP:MAINTOPIC. Mike Turnbull (talk) 11:03, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I understand, but since yesterday it has global media coverage also as first Ai Virtual Minister in the world some of sources are provided in current article alsoz this "intrigued" me to create an separate dedicated article.

Inappropriate video content – real-life murder[edit]
There is an ongoing discussion at Talk:Killing of Iryna Zarutska#Which video should we use in the article? which the questioner is welcome to join once protection is lifted. Be aware that The contentious topics procedure applies, as detailed at the top of that page. Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 16:25, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The following discussion is closed. Please do not modify it. Subsequent comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page. No further edits should be made to this discussion.
The article contains a video showing the real-life murder of Iryna Zarutska.
This content is highly inappropriate and violates Wikipedia’s policies on graphic or sensitive material.
Please remove the video to protect readers from exposure to violent content.
I cannot provide the link, but the video can be found under the article: Killing of Iryna Zarutska. 86.24.90.241 (talk) 13:45, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Links are provided this way [[Killing of Iryna Zarutska]] which appears as Killing of Iryna Zarutska.
The captions on that article claim that the actual act of killing is not in the video; if that is not the case, please discuss this on the article talk page. 331dot (talk) 13:48, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I tried, but the page is protected, and only extended confirmed users and administrators can edit it. 86.24.90.241 (talk) 13:59, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I will add that while Wikipedia is not censored, the actual act of killing should not be depicted, and I would wonder if the video should be in the infobox. 331dot (talk) 13:53, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Personally I don't think this should be in the infobox, even though the part with the killing is blurred. However, the article is currently under full protection.--♦IanMacM♦ (talk to me) 14:05, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The discussion above is closed. Please do not modify it. Subsequent comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page. No further edits should be made to this discussion.
Notability issue for Leonisa[edit]
I’m a declared paid editor working on behalf of Leonisa. The current article has a notability tag and a new tag for nomination of deletion. I have prepared a sandbox draft with significant independent sources including Forbes, El Tiempo, INSEAD, and The Best of Intima. These demonstrate coverage in multiple independent, reliable outlets. I believe this addresses notability concerns. Please see here: User:Leonisa3/sandbox. I'm unsure if an editor has reviewed the sandbox with improved references before the deletion nomination and I would like the opportunity to provide further references if these are not adequate. Thank you. Leonisa3 (talk) 14:39, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The best place to check this is at the deletion discussion. Mikenorton (talk) 15:06, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Accuracy of "Charlie Kirk"[edit]
I want to challenge the accuracy of "Political positions and activities" entries in the Charlie Kirk page, namely the sections "False Claims and Conspiracy Theories" and "COVID-19 misinformation."
In recent months, documents have become available showing that several of the claims against Kirk are themselves suspect. Buddy the wild geek (talk) 20:27, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

El Niño event renames[edit]
The renaming of the pages back to 1988-1990 La Niña event and back to 1991-1994 El Niño events, though with en dash and not with the hyphen
I'm having some serious troubles trying to prove for the fact the La Niña event that started in 1988 lasted up until the very first halves of 1990 and the fact El Niño events, three of them for exact, didn't really begin until Spring 1991 and didn't end until the late meteorological Summer in 1994-following which ENSO-Neutral periods dominated the period between Autumn 1994 until Spring 1995-at which latter time a weak La Niña event started to develop. I would rather comment on the content than the people who refuse to accept the references I was using, although they say these references are inaccurate and inappropriate (I'm talking the references I was using). These references are not only appropriate, they are very strong evidence pieces with these articles in question. Angela Kate Maureen Pears 03:27, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hello, @Tropical Storm Angela. Please be aware of the policy of Common name - articles are named from what the bulk of the reliable sources call them, not from their official name, or a more accurate name. ColinFine (talk) 12:25, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

trying to replace an infobox photo.[edit]
The infobox photo that I uploaded to Robert I. Misbim page is a selfie by Dr. Misbin, but the page keeps disappearing.
I think I (the page editor) have 3 problems:
1. Something has to be sent to Dr. Misbin to verify that he took the photo as a selfie, but I don't know the procedure for that.
2. Something must be put somewhere to tell editors that we are in the process of authentifying the photo -- but I don't what this process is.
3. I erroneously listed the date of the photo as in August 2025.
How do I change to the correct date, Nov. 29, 2022?
Thanks in advance for answering. Wikiedit888y (talk) 12:06, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hello, @Wikiedit888y. This needs to happen on Commons, not on Wikipedia. Try C:COM:VP.

Delete an image[edit]
How does one go about placing an AfD on an image at WIKIMEDIA COMMONS? This image: [4] states that it is in the public domain, but it is not. The original song itself may be (1939, 1942, 1955), but this actual arrangement (and image) isn't. It's currently published by living arranger Keith Young [5] at https://www.jwpepper.com/ publishing. The date given is 1955 and author is Crawford (original song), but the actual image is Young's arrangment through jwpepper. Thanks. Maineartists (talk) 17:54, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

How to change email to gain access to old account[edit]
The email address associated with my Wikipedia account is no longer active, and it's making me confirm my account to access even though I did not forget my password.
I visited Wikipedia:Request an account/ACC Wizard/Existing, but the link which states "If you'd like to change or remove the email address that you associated with your account, you can do so by clicking here" no longer works.
How do I got about regaining access to my account, if I can no longer confirm an active email address to get back into account? I don't want to create two accounts. 2600:4040:5013:4800:617D:90A2:9D5B:DD55 (talk) 19:26, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Referencing errors on Social Repose[edit]
Social Repose
Reference help requested.
None of the references are in red, indicating a missing title, and I scanned them manually, so I'm not sure where there is a title missing
Thanks, Shanthophile (talk) 20:49, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Shanthophile, your title is Referencing errors on [[Special:Diff/1295625433|Social Repose]]. It seems that you're asking not about the article as a whole but instead about a slingle diff. This adds {{cite web |url=https://www.nataliezworld.com/2014/09/blood-on-dance-floor-announces.html |website=https://www.nataliezworld.com}} which, contrary to what you seem to be saying, lacks the title attribute. (You've specified the title of the website but not that of the particular page.) As for the article as a whole, this has a vast number (currently 490) of what are presented as references, but many of which merely point to where (on Youtube, etc) one may find this or that song. It's not obvious where among these are the substantive sources on Giese ("Social Repose") himself that are reliable and also independent of him. -- Hoary (talk) 22:18, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I'm looking at that citation and it has a title in it, so I'm not sure what to do here?
"BLOOD ON THE DANCE FLOOR ANNOUNCES THE RECKONING TOUR". Natalie's World. 4 May 2015. Retrieved 14 June 2025.
So just to check, when I do the listing of singles, covers, etc., I can just list them and don't need anything to support that?
I can pull the links if they aren't necessary to prove that it is what it is.

Can I upload PlanEx image[edit]
I noticed on the Wikipedia page for Futurama that the planet express logo is not correct, and I am trying to change it. I found the correct image on fandom, but I do not know if I am allowed to change it, as it is on the fandom page and copyrighted by Fox, and the only option when uploading is "This is my image", i just would like to know if i am allowed to upload their image.
TinyNny (talk) 01:09, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I'm assuming the logo you want to replace is the picture used on this page. Whether it is or not, you should consider this:
There is a concept in copyright law called threshold of originality (Wikimedia Commons: c:Threshold of originality) which says that some logos are too simple to be eligible for copyright, but this threshold varies country by country. If it's below the threshold you can use a copyright tag like {{PD-ineligible}} or {{PD-textlogo}} when uploading. However, I'm not sure if the logo is below the threshold of originality, so you might be better asking at c:Commons:Village pump/Copyright since the people there are more experienced with copyright.
If it turns out to be above the threshold of originality, it has to be uploaded locally on Wikipedia under fair use, see Wikipedia:Non-free content for that, but keep in mind that requirements to upload non-free content is quite strict, and may be rejected if requirements are not met.

Yes, but only under very limited circumstances. Firstly, they need to meet our notability requirements. Then you need to declare your conflict of interest, and work through the process described at WP:AFC to make a draft article and have it reviewed by somebody independent.

vanishing or renaming blocked accounts[edit]
Why do you not offer vanishing or renaming for blocked accounts
What if the blocked account has real life name as username, before you say "they must appeal first" what if their appeals got rejected 49.237.38.203 (talk) 11:45, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Because blocking is for the person, not the account. I don't understand your second question. ColinFine (talk) 14:34, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@ColinFine: Wild guess: The IP presumes that we are one of those websites (pretty common tbh) were you get a limited number of appeals (common are 1 or 1.5) after wich you are - short of being friends with the site owner or similar back door stuff - simply screwed. @IP You can always make another appeal, at least after a while and a good read of WP:GAB, wether via talkpage or WP:UTRS. And in the (AFAIK exedingly rare, if that ever happened) case that you'll get a your talkpage revoked and banned from UTRS for no good reason there is always arbcom, still. Victor Schmidt (talk) 15:29, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I think that for the second question, it doesn't matter whether the username contains the editors' real name or not, they get the same response regarding where to appeal. That is unless the username match those of notable/famous people in which case, they have to follow the instructions at {{Uw-ublock-wellknown}}. Or if the username violates the username policy.

Are you asking "What if somebody using their real name as their username [let's call this person 'SURNU'] got blocked for being a sockpuppet of a username blocked for vandalizing Wikipedia, yet SURNU then became notable?"? If so, nothing in particular. If they break Wikipedia's rules, people who get articles can be or remain blocked. If people who are blocked become famous while they're blocked, they remain blocked.

I get the sense that you are talking about yourself? If so, you are evading your block by posting here and making it harder to be unblocked later.

Erika Kirk[edit]
I could not find a place on your webpage where I could express concerns. Please forward to the appropriate persons.
I am really assuming it is fake news from the unreliable right wingers, but when I heard that Wikipedia was considering removing Erika Kirk's biography was Wikipedia, I thought that it was in extremely poor taste and utterly poor timing. If she warranted a biography before his assassination, then why remove it now? It is inflamatory, sexist, and politically motivated. I thought Wikipedia was above such things. I definitely did not agree with everything Charlie Kirk said or believed, but he was courageous to go onto college campuses to provide an alternative opinion. Colleges must be a place where diverse opinions can be discussed and considered. Erika Kirk is planning to carry on his legacy, and it is way too early for a decision to delete her. I faithfully supported Wikipedia financially. If Wikipedia stoops this low, I will have to reconsider my support and my encouragement of my friends to continue their support. If this is fake news, get in front of this distasteful attempt by right winger antagonists to discredit your important website.

Hello @Nelson Huseby. You can view the deletion discussion for the Erika Kirk article at Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Erika Kirk.

Photo shopped photos[edit]
Robert F. KENNEDY Jr.'S photo is clearly doctored.
Are you allowing AI photos, or photo shopped pictures allowed? Pjtawney (talk) 23:27, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
It's flattering, but isn't necessarily photoshopped or AI. You'd be amazed by what old-school photographic lens choice, lighting and darkroom development techniques can do.
That said, I think the fact that it's (allegedly) an 'official photograph' and therefore in the public domain probably counts for a great deal in favour of its use in Wikipedia.
Incidentally, you say "Are you allowing . . .", but as an Account-registered editor of Wikipedia, you have exactly as much say in this matter as any other (and arguably more that myself, who remains accountless after 20+ years of activity) so you are free to bring this up and argue the case for disallowing it. You may want to peruse Wikipedia:Image use policy (including its Talk page) and Wikipedia:Photoshopped images.

I added the template to Category:Texas college and university user templates and users who have the template on their userpage will appear in Category:Wikipedians by alma mater: Stephen F. Austin State University. DMacks (talk) 04:54, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
if i make a wikipedia acount do I get to edit, delete, create, or change any page?[edit]
if i make a wikipedia acount do I get to edit, delete, create, or change any page? 36.255.112.138 (talk) 03:07, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Not necessarily. Among other things, pages might be protected from editing, or there might be other considerations. Your question is rather broad in scope though. DonIago (talk) 03:44, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Having a wikipedia account enables you to eventually be authorized to edit certain pages that you wouldn't otherwise be authorized to edit.
But with or without an account, pages may only be edited in accordance with the rules.
Creating a Wikipedia article, in particular, has a special set of rules, in that the subject must meet specific criteria, such as WP:Notability.
Article authors also need to be aware of the conflict of interest rules.
In general, I would say that if you are on some sort of mission that you are trying to accomplish on Wikipedia, I would be wary. If you're here to fix typos, improve articles, such as by verifying claims using appropriate citations, add appropriate content along with supporting citations, these are good things, but if you jump in without exercising caution, you may get burned. Fabrickator (talk) 03:51, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Only adminstrators can actually delete articles and other pages. Other editors can ask for pages to be deleted in various ways. For example, an editor blanking a page in their own userspace is interpreted as a request to delete that page. Cullen328 (talk) 06:11, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
See Wikipedia:User groups for details about what different users can do. You can already use Wikipedia:Articles for creation to submit an article for review but it's difficult for new users to make an acceptable article. PrimeHunter (talk) 09:18, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
How to request deletion of multiple empty redirect talk pages?[edit]
IP 88.251.82.151 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/88.251.82.151) created 19 blank talk pages of redirects, stopping when told that this was pointless. What is the correct procedure for requesting deletion? Speedy? Proposed deletion? --Guy Macon (talk) 04:06, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Is myheritage a reliable source?[edit]
I personally do not think so but I was just wondering. I think it was covered at WP:RSP but i typed in WP:MYHERITAGE and manually check RSP and I couldn't find any results. It is used a bunch of Wikipedia pages (usually for minor things) so it might be important to reach consensus on its reliability 🇪🇭🇵🇸🇸🇩 Easternsahara 🇪🇭🇵🇸🇸🇩 04:53, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Easternsahara There was an earlier discussion you missed at WP:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard/Archive_231#myheritage.com pointing out that it is user-generated but sometimes mentions underlying sources that could be OK. Mike Turnbull (talk) 10:50, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I've redirected WP:MYHERITAGE to that discussion, for now.We could perhaps do with a FAQ page about such sites in general. Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 11:32, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
'Part of a series' templates[edit]
Hi. I have a question regarding the criteria for templates that appear on articles all related to a similar thing. They normally say 'Part of a series on...'. Examples are Template:Formula One and Template:Homicide.
What is the criteria for a collection of articles to get one of these? Are there any rules regarding them, like the number of articles needed before a series can get a template? Or can I make one for any series of related articles and put it on each of the pages? Thanks! SnowyRiver28 (talk) 05:27, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@SnowyRiver28: I only know WP:SIDEBAR and WP:SERIES. Many things are better suited for navigation templates at the bottom of articles. If you post an idea for a sidebar then we may evaluate it. PrimeHunter (talk) 09:13, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Thank you for the links, this seems to be the most relevant documentation on this topic. As per WP:SIDEBAR, I'll raise this on the relevant talk page for the subject of the navbox I'm proposing, which is Talk:Red Dead Redemption 2 SnowyRiver28 (talk) 09:29, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Bolding of items in navbox[edit]
Is there some guideline that states that pages in a navigation box should display as bold when selected? --Jax 0677 (talk) 06:14, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Jax 0677: I guess you refer to selflinks where a link to the page itself is automatically bolded but not if it links via a redirect. See the first bullet at WP:BRINT. PrimeHunter (talk) 09:03, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Timmy Woulfe[edit]
I want to research and document the life of my father Timothy(Timmy) Woulfe who made a huge contribution to the lives of people in Athea, Co. Limerick, Ireland and beyond in educational, sporting cultural and many other areas. How should I go about this and how could Wikipedia perhaps help with this? Michael Woulfe. 51.37.124.94 (talk) 06:52, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
You should first review conflict of interest and understand that writing a new article is the most difficult task to attempt on Wikipedia(especially without prior experience in editing); but, you are permitted to create a draft using the Article Wizard in which you summarize what independent reliable sources with significant coverage have chosen on their own to say about your father and what makes him a notable person as Wikipedia uses the word. 331dot (talk) 08:13, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hello, Michael. My earnest advice to new editors is to not even think about
trying to create an article until you have spent several weeks - at least - learning about how Wikipedia works by making improvements to existing articles. Once you have understood core policies such as verifiability, neutral point of view, reliable, independent sources, and notability, and experienced how we handle disagreements with other editors (the Bold, Revert, Discuss cycle), then you might be ready to read your first article carefully, and try creating a draft. If you don't follow this advice but try to create an article without this preparation, you are likely to have a frustrating and disappointing experience with Wikipedia.
Note that a lot depends on what you mean by "research and document". If your work is primarily finding information in reliable published sources, then you may well be able to do this in Wikipedia, as long as enough of the sources are also independent of him (see WP:42) to establish notability. But if your research is finding and documenting unpublished sources (eg letters) or non-reliably published sources (eg newsletters, privately published books), then your work would be original research and not accepted in Wikipedia. ColinFine (talk) 09:53, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
If you simply want to research your father's life and work, you might do better to ask for help at your local library. Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 11:29, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Wiki Page Review Clarification[edit]
Hello,
I created an article recently and ensured that the article meets the Wikipedia standards. Some editors have also improved the article but it hasn't been approved till now.
What could be the cause please? Greatben001 (talk) 09:23, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
It would help to know which article you are referring to and to what approval you are seeking; I think you mean a New Pages Patroller's approval; that's an entirely volunteer run process.
Please be patient. 331dot (talk) 09:30, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Yes, I am referring to a New Page Patroller's approval. Here is the article: Derrick Lui. Thank you! Greatben001 (talk) 09:38, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I see that you took a picture of him, are you associated with him in some way(in order to get access to him to take his picture)? You've also only edited about him or his work.
Yes, a Patroller will eventually review the draft, but this may not be done quickly. 331dot (talk) 09:55, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
No, I am not associated with him. A colleague with whom I discussed my recent article is familiar with his short films and was the one who sent me a picture, from which I only cropped his image. My knowledge of him and his work is limited to information available from secondary sources. I would appreciate it if anyone with additional information about his life and work could improve the article. Greatben001 (talk) 10:12, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Greatben001 If you personally did not take the picture, nor your colleague(it sounds like), you must immediately without delay request deletion of the image from Commons, unless you can clearly show that the image was released with a license compatible with Wikipedia's(allowing for reuse by anyone for any purpose with attribution). You cropping it makes no difference in this regard. 331dot (talk) 13:30, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Somebody has already marked the image for possible copyright violation, which I believe is not fair. I confirmed with my colleague about the issue, and he explained that he personally took the picture on the red carpet at an event. I was cautious before uploading it because I had a similar experience recently. Greatben001 (talk) 13:54, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Greatben001 We take copyright really seriously on Wikipedia: your colleague must release the photo to Commons under a compatible license. You can't just upload a photograph your colleague took just because you say he said you can. qcne (talk) 14:15, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Please, guide me on how he can do that. Should I ask him to send me a To Whom It May Concern as evidence or what? Greatben001 (talk) 14:21, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Greatben001 The easiest thing would be for him to create an account on Wikimedia Commons himself, then upload the photo. Note that by uploading the photo he is releasing it under a license that permits anyone to reuse and remix the photo for any reason, including for commercial purposes. Please see Commons:First_steps/Contributing qcne (talk) 14:27, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Greatben001 See WP:A picture of you. Gråbergs Gråa Sång (talk) 15:46, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Thanks Greatben001 (talk) 16:16, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Greatben001 Is your colleague associated with the subject? I assume he wasn't at the "red carpet event" at random; he also seemed to have pretty good access to the event. 331dot (talk) 15:58, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
He is not associated with the subject but has good access to the event.
Greatben001 (talk) 16:16, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Indeed, it seems to be beyond what most ordinary people would have. Thank you 331dot (talk) 16:26, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Measuring navbox use[edit]
The navboxes at the bottom of articles: Is there a way to determine how much each navbox is being used by readers? Donald Trump is approaching the WP:PEIS limit, and the easiest solution would be to remove the least-used navboxes. ―Mandruss ☎ IMO. 10:01, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Mandruss we do not have such analytics unless the link is an unique on on the page. I would suggest condensing the content on the page further as an easier way out. – robertsky (talk) 10:54, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I agree, but your suggestion has been a point of contention for years, like eight of them. I said "easiest", not "best". You're welcome to join the article on our side. Thanks for the reply. ―Mandruss ☎ IMO. 11:02, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Mandruss: you have inspired me to propose an edit to the article. Has anyone suggested splitting the article into Donald Trump, Part 1 and Donald Trump, Part 2? TSventon (talk) 22:10, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Actually, I suggested that years ago. I was joking. I don't think Wikipedia does that. Anyway, not even Donald Trump merits that much coverage in his BLP. The problem is too much detail for post-2015, and the refusal of editors to accept that fact. ―Mandruss ☎ IMO. 02:12, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Grenada station to Grenada Depot[edit]
Hi, I have been trying to find evidence of Grenada depot being the common name for Grenada station, and I finally might have proof of it being the common name https://grenadastar.newspapers.com/image/1191146055/, I want to know if this is enough proof of it.
IC 9612 (talk) 19:35, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Considering the arguments made against your proposal at the RM earlier this year @ Talk:Grenada station#Requested move 28 April 2025, I doubt that clipping will change other editors’ opinions. The discussion is better had on the talk page. Sam Sailor 20:42, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Special:Mute[edit]
I just noticed a "Mute this user" option in the toolbox when viewing someone else's userpage.
What does it do?
If you go to Special:Mute, it just says The username requested could not be found.
Return to Main Page, and I ran a Google search and got a similar page at mediawiki.org.
Nothing at WP:Mute.
My Google search found Phabricator pages for this tool (phab:T359677 and phab:T339813), but they don't explain what it's for.
Nyttend (talk) 20:09, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Nyttend:, try WP:MUTE, I haven't read it myself yet. TSventon (talk) 20:39, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Maybe Special:Mute should have a box to enter a username. See Special:Mute/PrimeHunter for
what the toolbox link does. There is a selection and confirmation step so don't worry about clicking the link. You can also use the bottom of Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-echo. It has a link to mw:Special:MyLanguage/Help:Notifications#mute. PrimeHunter (talk) 20:44, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Thanks, PrimeHunter, I've muted you as a test.
Could you mention me in a comment here, and then could you leave a note on my talk page?
I still use the OBOD, so I'll definitely notice your note.

It does like I thought.
Thanks!

Google doesn't show any obvious sourcing for this, nor does the Brown Daily Herald, so it shouldn't be included. See also WP:ONEDAY. SarekOfVulcan (talk) 20:59, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
