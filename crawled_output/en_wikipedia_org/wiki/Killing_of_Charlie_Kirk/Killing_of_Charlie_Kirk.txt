On September 10, 2025, Charlie Kirk, an American right-wing political activist, was fatally shot while addressing an audience on the campus of Utah Valley University (UVU) in Orem, Utah, United States. The outdoor event was the first stop of the season for his American Comeback Tour, a speaking and debate series organized by Turning Point USA, a conservative organization he co-founded.
While engaging with an audience member about mass shootings in the United States, Kirk was shot in the neck by a gunman who was on the roof of a building some 142 yards (130 m) away; he was pronounced dead at a nearby hospital. A suspect, 22-year-old Tyler James Robinson, was arrested on September 12 and is believed to be the only person involved. Bullets recovered nearby were inscribed with various messages from video-gaming and internet culture, leading to varied speculation about the shooter's motive.
The killing was highlighted as an instance of increasing political violence within the United States and prompted widespread condemnation of the killing from public figures globally. President Donald Trump and some congressional Republicans recieved criticism for immediately blaming Democrats and left-wing or liberal beliefs in general.[1][2][3] Influential conservatives called for retribution.[4][5][6] Video footage of the shooting spread rapidly on social media, and reactions featured heartfelt messages from the left and right, anguish about political violence, and sharply partisan commentary.[7] Government agencies and private organizations sought to compile lists of people reacting to Kirk's death in ways deemed inappropriate that soon expanded to policing general criticism of Kirk unrelated to his death,[8] resulting in firings and death threats.[9]
Background
Kirk speaking at University of Florida during an earlier stop of his "American Comeback Tour" on February 27, 2025
Charlie Kirk was an American conservative political activist, author, and media personality, known for co-founding and serving as CEO of Turning Point USA.[10] A close ally of United States president Donald Trump, Kirk utilized his skills in social media and campus organizing to become a highly influential figure in the "hard-right movement".[11] Described as "something of a kingmaker" by The New York Times, Kirk was able to rally support to protect embattled Trump cabinet nominees and against Republican Party figures he deemed insufficiently supportive of Trump.[11] The Washington Post described him as "one of the most prominent voices on the right" in recent years.[12] Axios described Kirk as a "driving force" in Trump's presidential campaigns.[13]
Kirk's killing occurred during a period of deepening division and increasingly frequent violence in American politics.[14][15][16] It followed a series of violent political incidents, including the June 2025 shootings of two Minnesota legislators and their spouses,[17][18] the May 2025 killing of two Israeli embassy staffers in Washington, D.C.,[19][20] the April 2025 arson attack on Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro's residence,[21][22] the December 2024 killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson,[23][24] and assassination attempts on Trump in July and September 2024.[16][25] At a campaign event in June 2025, Kirk himself spoke about the potential for violence: "We're on the front lines where it's not always safe."[26]
Since 2016, there has been a large increase in attacks on politicians and government employees.[27] START researcher Michael Jensen recorded 150 politically motivated attacks in the first half of 2025, almost twice the number in the same period in 2024.[28] The majority of political violence in recent years has been committed by right-leaning perpetrators.[29][27][30][31][32] The Anti-Defamation League found that from 2022 through 2024, all of the 61 political killings in the U.S. were committed by right-wing extremists.[33] Counter-terrorism experts described Trump's previous pardon of the January 6 attackers as creating a permission structure for them to commit political violence.[34][33] Most perpetrators do not belong to any formal organization; instead, extremist ideologies spread on social media, where "a crude language of memes, slang and jokes blurs the line between posturing and provoking violence, normalising radical ideologies and activities".[30]
Kirk's scheduled appearance at UVU
Turning Point USA announced on August 27 that Kirk would be visiting several college campuses during September–October 2025 as part of a speech and debate series titled the American Comeback Tour.[35] Kirk's appearance at UVU was scheduled to be the first stop on the tour.[10] A petition was circulated calling on the university to cancel his appearance, but university officials permitted the speech, citing free speech and open discussion policies.[36] Approximately 3,000 people attended the event,[37] which was secured by six police officers and Kirk's private security personnel.[38][37] Although the event was ticketed, the ticketing was not enforced. Metal detectors were not used for entry to the event.[39]
Shooting
The shot was reportedly fired from the roof of the Losee Center.
Kirk was under a tent in the grassy amphitheater at bottom left; the shot reportedly came from the roof of the building at upper right.
Map of locations: (1) suspect at 11:50 a.m., (2) pedestrian tunnel, (3) parking garage, (4) shooter on roof, (5) Charlie Kirk, (6) suspect drops to ground, (7) rifle found in wooded area
The suspected gunman arrived on campus in a gray Dodge Challenger at 8:29 a.m. MDT (UTC–6).[40] Security camera footage examined by investigators showed he was dressed differently than he was around the time of the shooting.[40]
Investigators said that the suspect reappeared on video at around 11:50 a.m., when he moved through a grassy area into a parking lot near the campus. Video posted by TMZ on Twitter appears to show the suspect in the area described by the investigators.[40] At 11:53 a.m., he stopped at the top of some stairs and "pulled out his phone" before proceeding into a pedestrian tunnel.[40] Still images released by the FBI show him ascending a stairwell in a parking garage adjacent to the tunnel.[40] The speaking event began at noon.[41] Authorities said he was seen at 12:02 p.m. walking on the north side of the Losee Center, where they said he would later shoot Kirk from the roof.[40] According to an affidavit, the suspect entered the Losee Center from the southeast side and was seen ascending the stairs next to the building 13 minutes later.[40] Investigators said that by 12:22 p.m., he was on the roof, lying on his stomach, facing the location where Kirk was speaking.[40]
Sitting under a tent displaying the tour title, Kirk engaged in a back-and-forth exchange with UVU student Hunter Kozak about mass shootings in the United States.[42][43][44] At 12:23 p.m., a single shot was fired from the roof of the Losee Center,[40][45][46] 142 yards (130 m) from Kirk, hitting him in the neck.[41][47][48][49] Emma Pitts, a Deseret News reporter who witnessed the event, told NPR, "I just saw so much blood come out of the left side of Charlie's neck, and then he went limp."[44] Former U.S. representative Jason Chaffetz, who was in attendance, said, "As soon as the shot went out, everybody hit the deck and everybody started scattering and yelling and screaming."[37]
Video footage also surfaced of the suspected shooter running from the south corner of the Losee Center roof, where he purportedly shot Kirk, to the north corner, where the ground was higher and he could hang from the edge of the roof and drop to the ground, which occurred at about 12:24 p.m.[41] Palm prints were later found at the edge of the roof, as well as smudges from which samples were collected to look for DNA evidence, and a footprint was found on the ground, which showed he was wearing Converse sneakers. He then moved into a wooded area north of the campus, where a rifle with a scope on top and containing inscribed bullet casings was later found.[41][50]
According to police audio, the first report of the shooting occurred at 12:26 p.m. At 12:31 p.m., an officer then reported "gunshots heard near the library". At 12:35 p.m., the officer added "maybe the CS building", before describing the shooter as "wearing jeans, black shirt, black mask, long rifle". A minute later, the officer elaborated, "on top of the building on the far north side, just east of the library".[51] Kirk was carried by six men to an SUV, which took him to Timpanogos Regional Hospital in Orem,[52][37][53] where he underwent surgery.[54][55] His death was announced by Donald Trump at 2:40 p.m. on Truth Social.[56][57] At 12:37 p.m., the university closed the campus and urged everyone to leave.[58] At 2:01 p.m., the university instructed those remaining on campus to "secure in place until police officers can escort you safely off campus".[59] Classes and activities at all campuses, including satellite locations, were suspended until September 15.[60][61]
Investigation
FBI-released CCTV footage of a suspect jumping from the rooftop of a building following the shooting. The jumping starts at 18 seconds into the video.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) assisted in the investigation.[55]
Initial arrests
Two people were arrested soon after the shooting.[62] One was conservative-libertarian activist George Zinn. He was arrested on campus grounds after claiming to have shot Kirk,[63] but was released soon after. Authorities later clarified that Zinn's arrest was for potential obstruction of justice. It was also reported that Zinn had a history of mental health issues and of disrupting public events.[63] Within hours of the shooting, FBI director Kash Patel announced on social media that "the subject" in Kirk's killing had been apprehended; Utah governor Spencer Cox said that a "person of interest" was being detained. Within two hours of Patel's initial announcement, he said that the subject had been "released after an interrogation by law enforcement".[64][62]
Evidence and leads
Law enforcement recovered an older-make Mauser-type bolt-action hunting rifle chambered in .30-06,[65][66] from a wooded area near the shooting,[67] engraved bullets, and "a footwear impression, a palm print, and forearm imprints for analysis".[68][69] In a press conference on September 11, officials said that they had "good video footage" and were applying facial recognition technology to it.[68][67] Later that day, the FBI indicated that facial recognition efforts had been unsuccessful, released photos of a person of interest,[70] and offered up to $100,000 for information in the case.[71][72][69]
Bullet inscriptions
Bullets found in the rifle were inscribed with various messages and internet memes. The spent case was inscribed with "Notices bulges OwO what's this?", a reference to furry online roleplay.[73] Three unfired rounds were engraved with: "Hey fascist! Catch! ↑→↓↓↓", the arrows referring to a sequence of game controller inputs used to summon a bomb in the video game Helldivers 2; "Oh bella ciao bella ciao bella ciao ciao ciao", a reference to the Italian anti-fascist song "Bella ciao"; and "If you read this, you are gay LMAO."[73][74][75] The song "Bella ciao" remains widely known as an anti-fascist anthem; however, it had also resurfaced in popular media since the mid-2010s through the television series Money Heist and the video games Hearts of Iron IV and Far Cry 6.[76][77][78]
Suspect
Tyler James Robinson (born 2003)[79] was identified as a suspect by his father who recognized him as the alleged shooter and confronted him. Robinson's father informed the bishop of his Mormon congregation,[80] who contacted the United States Marshals Service.[81] Robinson was arrested at his residence on September 12,[82] whereupon an affidavit of probable cause was filed;[83] Governor Cox said later that day that Robinson was the only suspect.[84][85] After his arrest, Robinson was transferred to a Utah County jail in Spanish Fork, where a judge ordered him held without bail.[86] He is scheduled to make his first court appearance on September 16, 2025.[87]
At the time of his arrest, Robinson was 22 years old and living in St. George, Utah, a 3+1⁄2-hour drive from Utah Valley University.[88] He was in his third year of an electrical apprenticeship program at Dixie Technical College.[89] He had previously enrolled at Utah State University but dropped out after one semester.[89] From 2019 to 2021, while still in high school, he earned college credit from Dixie State University.[89] Robinson's family were members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,[90] and Robinson's grandmother said the entire family are Republicans and Trump supporters.[91] Robinson was registered to vote but not affiliated with any party, and there is no record of him voting in Washington County (of which St. George is the county seat).[92] Robinson had no criminal record prior to his arrest.[93]
Investigators interviewed Robinson's transgender roommate, whom Utah governor Spencer Cox said was in a romantic relationship with him. The roommate's name has been kept secret as authorities do not believe they were involved in the crime.[94] Additionally, the roommate was described as being "aghast" and "shocked" by the shooting and claimed to have had no knowledge about the crime.[95][96][94] Moreover, Cox said that the roommate has been "very cooperative" with investigators[96] and has turned over private messages incriminating Robinson which discussed the "need to retrieve a rifle from a drop point, leaving the rifle in a bush, messages related to visually watching the area where a rifle was left, and a message referring to having left the rifle wrapped in a towel." The messages also referenced a scope and engraved bullets.[82] After the shooting, in a private Discord group chat where someone said he looked like the man in the initial suspect images, Robinson reportedly joked that he had a doppelgänger who was trying to frame him, that the group should give him a cut of the FBI reward money for turning him in, that he would avoid going to McDonald's (a reference to the location of Luigi Mangione's arrest), and that he would get rid of his manifesto and rifle.[97][94] A recovered message also read: "Hey guys, I have bad news for you all. It was me at UVU yesterday. im [sic] sorry for all of this." Discord suspended his account.[98]
On September 14, Governor Cox alleged that Robinson had "very different" political views than those of his conservative family and "clearly" adhered to "leftist ideology".[99][100][101] According to Cox, Robinson appears to have "radicalized" after dropping out of Utah State University and may have been influenced by aspects of Internet culture. Cox also said that one of Robinson's relatives had told investigators that during a family dinner, Robinson had expressed dislike of Kirk and discussed his upcoming visit at Utah Valley University.[81]
On September 15, the FBI announced that Robinson's DNA matched that found on a towel wrapping the suspected rifle and on a screwdriver found on the roof from where the shot was fired.[102] The FBI is also investigating several social media accounts, at least one of which has a link to Robinson's roommate, that indicated potential foreknowledge of the date and circumstance of Kirk's shooting.[103]
Reactions and analysis
Domestic response
United States president Donald Trump addressed the nation from the Oval Office about the shooting, recorded September 10, 2025.
The shooting saw bipartisan condemnation from politicians.[104] Messages of sympathy came from United States president Donald Trump, vice president JD Vance,[105] and first lady Melania Trump,[106] House speaker Mike Johnson, Senate majority leader John Thune,[107] and former president George W. Bush,[108] among other Republicans.[37] Democratic politicians also condemned the shooting, including former presidents Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, and Joe Biden,[37][109] Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries,[110] California governor Gavin Newsom, and Minnesota representative Ilhan Omar.[111]
Some politicians responded to the shooting by linking it to broader political debates. Some congressional Republicans blamed Democrats and accused liberals of "inciting violence with rhetoric".[1][6][5] Democrats and some news media pushed back against the claim, describing Trump's divisive rhetoric as also a factor in coarsening public debate and that political violence had impacted both parties. Democrats also cited the killing to further discussions of gun safety legislation.[112] Some Republicans used the killing to condemn liberal beliefs and ideology as evil.[3] On September 11, a letter was published online from 16 Congressional Republicans to House Speaker Mike Johnson calling for a statue to be erected in Kirk's memory in the United States Capitol.[113]
The New York Times described Trump as condemning political violence but only on the left, while downplaying or seemingly excusing political violence on the right;[114][115] it described him as abandoning the traditional presidential role as a unifier to instead blame his opponents and vow revenge.[2] In his nationwide address, Trump solely blamed the radical left for Kirk's and other recent deaths, saying they "compared wonderful Americans like Charlie to Nazis"; Trump did not express concern about recent Democratic victims of violence.[116][112] The Atlantic criticized the response for blaming his political opponents as accessories to murder,[117] and NBC News called Trump's response "far more polarizing than many of the other messages offered by politicians and representatives of both parties".[112] The Economist noted that contrary to Trump's accusations, most perpetrators of political violence in recent years have been right-leaning.[27] Trump ordered all Federal government flags to be flown at half-staff until September 14 at 6 p.m. in Kirk's honor.[37] Critics noted that Trump had not done the same when Democratic Minnesota representative Melissa Hortman was killed in her home in June.[118][17][119] Trump later released a video tribute to Kirk and announced he would be posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.[120]
In response to Trump, Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro, himself the target of an arson attack, said: "The president shouldn't cherry-pick what counts and what doesn't count. When he does that, it gives a pass to some. We can't have that. This is a moment where leaders need to speak and act with moral clarity, where we need to condemn this type of violence in our communities, in our politics."[121] The next day, Trump stated: "We have radical left lunatics out there and we just have to beat the hell out of them", but later said he hoped his supporters would be nonviolent.[122] During a Fox & Friends interview on September 12, when asked by co-host Ainsley Earhardt how he would fix the country and about the presence of radical individuals on both sides of the political aisle, Trump responded: "I'll tell you something that's going to get me in trouble, but I couldn't care less. The radicals on the right oftentimes are radical because they don't want to see crime", adding: "The radicals on the left are the problem."[123][124] On September 15, Trump called the left "scum", and stated that "If you look at the problem, the problem is on the left. It's not on the right".[125] Experts on political violence described the rush to assign blame as potentially leading to more conflict.[33]
Johnson held a 30-second moment of silence in the U.S. House of Representatives for Kirk, observed by all House members. Following disagreements on the floor, the event descended into partisan rancor and accusations by both sides.[126] Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said that The Pentagon is "tracking ... very closely" any civilian and military employee who is a Kirk detractor or who celebrated his death, to impose punishment.[127][128] Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau urged social media users to turn in foreign residents of the U.S. who mocked or celebrated Kirk's death.[129] The U.S. State Department said it would review the legal status of immigrants found to be "praising, rationalizing, or making light" of Kirk's killing.[130] White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy Stephen Miller said Kirk's killing was the result of an "ideology" that is "at war with family and nature ... that leads, always, inevitably and willfully, to violence", and must be defeated.[131][132] He reiterated his position on Fox News, and said that Kirk's final message to him urged him to "dismantle and take on the radical left organizations in this country that are fomenting violence." Miller promised to do so using "the power of law enforcement, under President Trump's leadership".[133][134][135] Elon Musk claimed leftists were celebrating Kirk's death.[136][137]
International responses

Kirk's death garnered messages of condolence from world leaders and foreign politicians. British prime minister Keir Starmer, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Canadian prime minister Mark Carney, Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni, Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán, Czech prime minister Petr Fiala, Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese, Georgian prime minister Irakli Kobakhidze, Argentine president Javier Milei, Polish president Karol Nawrocki, New Zealand acting prime minister David Seymour, Swedish deputy prime minister Ebba Busch, Scottish First Minister John Swinney, the Vatican City secretary of state Cardinal Pietro Parolin, and Mexican president Claudia Sheinbaum offered their condolences and condemned the shooting.[138] Salvadoran president Nayib Bukele criticized the media's coverage of the event.[139] Paraguayan president Santiago Peña paid tribute to Kirk during a speech commemorating the 138th anniversary of the ruling Colorado Party.[140]
On September 11, the European Conservatives and Reformists Group (ECR Group) and Europe of Sovereign Nations Group (ESN Group), the right-wing and far-right political groups in the European Parliament, put forward a motion to hold a minute of silence to honor Kirk. The motion was rejected by Parliament president Roberta Metsola, though Swedish ECR Group MEP Charlie Weimers was permitted to make a statement on Kirk's shooting before the voting session began. Weimers' attempt to yield part of his time for a moment of silence was interrupted by Parliament vice president Katarina Barley.[141]
Vox and Patriots.eu president Santiago Abascal paid tribute to Kirk during the party's annual convention, Europa Viva 25 [es], in Madrid, by wearing a shirt similar to the one Kirk had been wearing when he was shot.[142] Appearing via video at the Unite the Kingdom rally in London, organized prior to the shooting of Kirk by far-right anti-Islam activist Tommy Robinson, Elon Musk described the killing as "cold blood" and alleged that "the left is the party of murder".[143][144]
Media
News of Charlie Kirk's shooting and subsequent death dominated the day's news agenda, with major news networks entering into "breaking news mode" around 2:50 p.m. ET, upon receiving word that Kirk had been shot in the neck area, with rolling coverage continuing throughout the day.[145] Significant public interest in the event saw Fox News, MSNBC, and CNN all "drawing larger audiences than usual". On September 10, 2025, the three networks collectively averaged 6.9 million viewers, a 65% jump from the 4.2 million who watched a week earlier. September 11 saw the three networks draw a combined audience of 6.2 million, up 72% from the prior week's 3.6 million.[146] On September 12, Fox News hosted a primetime special titled Charlie Kirk: An American Original.[147] Publications including The National, The Nation, and The New Republic have accused the mass media of "whitewashing" Kirk's career by opting for a "sympathetic coverage" of his death rather than "critically engaging with his ideology".[148][149][150]
Analyst Matthew Dowd was fired by MSNBC after he appraised Kirk as "one of the most divisive, especially divisive younger figures in this, who is constantly sort of pushing this sort of hate speech or sort of aimed at certain groups. And I always go back to, hateful thoughts lead to hateful words, which then lead to hateful actions."[151][152] A reporter in Florida was suspended for asking Congressional Representative Randy Fine if the shooting would prompt him to rethink his opposition to gun control.[153] Karen Attiah was fired from The Washington Post after posting a quote of Kirk on social media stating that Black women such as Michelle Obama and Shelia Jackson Lee did not have "the brain processing power to be taken seriously".[154]
Fox News host Jesse Watters said, "They are at war with us ... We're going to avenge Charlie's death in the way he would want it avenged ... Charlie would want us to put as much pressure on these people as possible."[155][156] Progressive streamer Hasan Piker, who had been due to debate Kirk later in September, called the killing a "terrifying incident", and said: "The reverberation of people seeking out vengeance in the aftermath of this violent, abhorrent incident is going to be genuinely worrisome."[157]
On September 11, Comedy Central announced that it would be cancelling all scheduled re-runs of the South Park episode "Got a Nut", in which the character of Eric Cartman portrayed a parodic version of Kirk.[158] This followed an online campaign to have the show cancelled over its satirical portrayal of Kirk so close to his death.[159] Kirk himself had expressed appreciation for his parody in the episode, describing it as "hilarious".[160] DC Comics cancelled Gretchen Felker-Martin's Red Hood book series one day after its debut, after the writer celebrated Kirk's death on Bluesky.[161][162]
On September 12, during Coldplay's concert at Wembley Stadium, Chris Martin asked the audience to 'send love' to Charlie Kirk’s family.[163]
Several National Football League and Major League Baseball teams paid tribute to Kirk in their games following his death, though teams in both leagues faced criticism from fans for either honoring Kirk due to his beliefs or not honoring Kirk despite having honored other people and causes in years past.[164][165][166]
Social media
News of Kirk's death prompted fervent reactions on social media.[167][168][169] The New York Times described social media as featuring heartfelt messages from the left and right, anguish about political violence, and sharply partisan and political takes.[7] A remark Kirk had made following the 2023 Nashville school shooting – "It's worth to have a cost of, unfortunately, some gun deaths every single year so that we can have the Second Amendment to protect our other God-given rights" – was reposted numerous times on social media after the shooting.[7]
According to the Associated Press, uncensored videos of Kirk being shot spread across social media with "lightning speed".[170] U.S. representative Anna Paulina Luna called on social media platforms to remove the video. The Tech Transparency Project, a nonprofit watchdog organization, reported that Instagram's teen accounts, which are designed with additional safety features for teens, could readily find videos of the shooting. Organizations that monitor media for children, including Common Sense Media and parental controls app Bark, reported spikes in traffic following the shooting as parents sought out advice on how to talk to their kids about it and prevent them from seeing the video. The day after the shooting, most of the graphic videos had been removed from social media, though they still showed up in searches and algorithmic feeds, particularly on Twitter and TikTok.[171]
Several far-right figures encouraged retaliatory violence against Democrats and saw the death as a recruiting event.[1][172][4][131] Before the shooter's identity and motivations were known, several influential right-wing voices called for vengeance and war.[1][6][5] A website called "Expose Charlie's Murderers" invited users to submit links to people celebrating his murder.[111][4] Three days after the shooting, the site had accumulated 30,000 submissions; cybersecurity experts characterized the site as a means to coordinate harassment, and as an echo of Turning Point USA's Professor Watchlist.[173][157] Reuters reported that some right-wing influencers who encouraged reporting social media posts had previously mocked political violence; Reuters cited comments from a number of right-wing activists, including Kirk, about past events including the attack on Paul Pelosi, the husband of Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.[174]
Several news outlets noted that in the days after the shooting, multiple people—including teachers, firefighters, and members of the military and U.S. Secret Service—were fired from their jobs for social media posts that celebrated Kirk's killing or were seen as disparaging of his legacy, and many received death threats.[173][9][174] The Oxford Union initiated disciplinary proceedings against its then-president-elect George Abaraonye, who had debated Kirk earlier in the year, after he posted comments appearing to celebrate Kirk's killing.[175][176] Social media companies including Meta, YouTube, Reddit and Bluesky issued statements denouncing posts that glorified Kirk's killing, which in extreme cases included incitement to violence against other right-wing commentators.[177]
On September 15, JD Vance called on Americans to report those allegedly celebrating Kirk's killing to their employers and promised to use the federal government to investigate and punish liberal organizations and donors. The Associated Press described the campaign as having "broadened to include even those whose statements were critical of Kirk without celebrating his assassination". Adam Goldstein of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression described the shift as a form of right-wing cancel culture, noting that people were being targeted for simply quoting Kirk or failing to mourn his passing adequately. Goldstein said that "government involvement in this does inch this closer to looking like McCarthyism".[8]
Public reaction
Opinion polling
Public concern about political violence was high after Kirk's killing. In a YouGov poll, 87% agreed that political violence is a problem today. However, a minority—7% of conservatives and 18% of liberals—said that political violence "can sometimes be justified". Of those aged 18–29, 22% agreed, while only 3% over 65 did. YouGov said that public attitudes have varied over time depending on the identity of the victims, with concern rising more after an attack on a member of one's own party.[178] Other outlets noted earlier polls with differing results: in a May 2025 poll, roughly 20% of both parties considered violence "acceptable",[30] while in two polls from 2023 and 2024, roughly 10% of Democrats and 30% of Republicans said that violence may be "necessary".[179][180] Similarly, a September 2025 poll by FIRE found that over 30% of college students supported the use of violence to stop a speaker—an 80% increase since 2020.[181] According to G. Elliott Morris, such polling exaggerates approval of political violence. Asking more precise questions, less than 5% condone violent felonies, with little difference between parties.[182] Furthermore, individuals tend to significantly overestimate approval of violence within the other party, and are less likely to support it themselves when correctly informed.[183]
The day after the shooting, a YouGov poll asked several thousand of American adults if it was acceptable to be happy at the death of a public figure; 56% said it was never acceptable (including 77% of Republicans and 38% of Democrats), 22% said it was usually unacceptable, 6% said it was usually acceptable, and 3% said it was always acceptable.[184]
A subsequent YouGov poll, conducted on September 14, found that a majority (51%) of Americans think the person who assassinated Charlie Kirk was driven by political beliefs. Republicans were more likely to say the killer was driven by political views, with 63% of Republican respondents saying this, compared to less than half of Democrats (44%) and independents (46%) saying the same. On September 15, a plurality of respondents (40%) said they were not sure of the political affiliations of the killer, 24% said they believed he was a Republican, 21% a Democrat, and 15% affiliated with neither. Members of each party were most likely to believe that he was a affiliated with the other.[185][186]
Vigils and donations
Following Kirk's death, a mural and memorial site was set up on Utah Valley University campus, close to the site of the shooting.[61] A number of candlelight vigils mostly, but not exclusively, organized by Turning Point, have taken place in various cities across the United States.[187] Similar vigils have also been held in Australia,[188][189] France,[190] Germany,[191] Italy,[191] Spain,[191] South Africa,[190] and the United Kingdom.[188][192] Several online fundraisers were set up in Kirk's name, in order to honor his legacy and provide financial support for the family. By September 14, all of the different fundraisers saw donations of over $6 million.[193]
Speculation and conspiracy theories
A lack of initial information sparked mass speculation about the killing.[194] Misinformation about the suspect was also widely shared on social media, including a doctored photo of him wearing a pro-Trump shirt, and false claims he was a registered Republican, had donated to Trump's campaign, or was a registered member of the Democratic Socialists of America.[195][196] Artificial intelligence tools such as Grok, Perplexity AI, and AI Overviews also disseminated misinformation.[197]
Hours after the shooting right-wing media and commentators began speculating that the shooter was transgender because Kirk was in the middle of answering a question about transgender people when he was shot.[198][199] The New York Times noted that this was "a grim coincidence that has fed into online conspiracies and speculation" and Hunter Kozak, who asked Kirk the question, later said: "I couldn't have asked a worse question."[200]
Before the identity of the shooter was known, misinformation on social media attempted to link multiple trans people to the shooting including Skye Valadez, a trans musician from Ogden, Utah, who reportedly uploaded a song to SoundCloud a month prior that seemed to predict Kirk's death, but has since removed it.[201][202] At the same time, an X user with the handle @NajraGalvz who claimed to be a UVU student by the name of "Omar" allegedly made a post the day before the shooting saying "something big" would happen the next day at Utah Valley University. A screenshot of the post along with a photo of a trans women that was edited to be under the account's handle went viral. However, fact checkers revealed that the photo had been stolen from another unrelated account belonging to a trans women named Michaela from Seattle, Washington, who had nothing to do with the shooting. Despite this, Michaela reported receiving hundreds of messages containing death threats and harassment from right-wing social media users accusing her of being the shooter. Michaela contacted the FBI to report the harassment, but expressed doubt that law enforcement could protect her from the attacks.[203][204] Meanwhile, @NajraGalvz later changed their username after denying involvement in the crime and another person adopted the handle to stop it from being hijacked for scams.[203] Other online conspiracies falsely attempted to claim Skye Valadez and @NajraGalvz were the same person.[205][204]
Early reporting, notably in The Wall Street Journal, falsely reported that the inscriptions on the bullets were found as having "transgender ideology" messaging, citing what they claimed was an internal bulletin of the ATF.[206] These reports were met with calls for caution from trans journalists - who said that "transgender ideology" was a term commonly used in right-wing circles to frame transgender identity as a political choice - and The New York Times reported that a senior law enforcement official with knowledge of the case said that the alleged bulletin had not been verified, and that it did not match other summaries of evidence; however, prominent conservative figures still seized on The Wall Street Journal's report to call for further action against the trans community.[207][206][208] Following these reports, Google searches for "transgender ideology" spiked throughout the country, especially in Utah.[198] When the details of the actual messages, which did not contain any such references, were made public, the Human Rights Campaign published an open letter demanding a retraction and a public apology for publishing of the misinformation, saying: "This reporting was reckless and irresponsible, and it led to a wave of threats against the trans community from right-wing influencers—and a resulting wave of terror for a community that is already living in fear."[206][209][210] The Wall Street Journal later amended the story with a note from the editor, however they did not issue a retraction.[209][211][212]
More transgender conspiracy theories abound after the reveal that the suspected shooter, Tyler Robinson, had a transgender girlfriend whom he was living with, with some speculating that Robinson may have been motivated to kill Kirk because of Kirk's views and rhetoric on transgender people, despite no motive being confirmed at the time. Jacey Thornton, an executive director of the LGBTQ advocacy group Rainbow Utah, noted that "It sounds like [they're] really stretching to find a way to tie this in to the trans community", adding that this is "very harmful to this ongoing dialogue that's happening, especially on social media".[94][95]
It was also speculated that one of the inscriptions found on the bullets could be a reference to the far-right Groyper culture.[76] The latter interpretation was based in part on the adversarial stance that the Groypers had towards Kirk, such as during their 2019 heckling campaign (the "Groyper War").[213] Groyper leader and far-right commentator Nick Fuentes rejected this speculation, stating that his followers were being "framed".[213]
Numerous conspiracy theories about the attack were posted online.[214] Political consultant Roger Stone said the attack appeared to have been "a professional hit either by a nation state, rogue elements of our own government or a terrorist organization".[194] One theory, promulgated by Russian state media RT, centered on people standing near Kirk, who were purported to have made "unusual gestures" before he was killed.[214][194] Several senior Russian officials, including former president Dmitry Medvedev and Kremlin negotiator Kirill Dmitriev, speculated on social media without evidence about a connection between Kirk's murder and United States support for Ukraine, because Kirk had been a critic of Western financial and political support for Ukraine in its conflict with Russia.[215][216] New Zealand-based news website Stuff refuted a theory that the video of Kirk's death was purportedly faked due to Kirk's ring appearing to switch fingers, reporting that the ring "appeared to be hinged, meaning a latch opens and closes the ring on the finger".[217]
In the days immediately following the killing, conspiracy theories also emerged about the involvement of Israel.[218][219][220] According to The New Republic, some commentators attempted to link the event to the Israeli Mossad and to Kirk's comments about the Epstein files.[221][219][220] The Forward reported that Maram Susli resurfaced an August 2025 post by an Infowars host claiming that Kirk believed "Israel will kill [him] if he turns against them".[220] Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected the theories, calling them "insane".[219]
Funeral
On September 11, Kirk's casket, accompanied by United States vice president JD Vance, second lady Usha Vance, and Kirk's widow Erika Kirk,[222] was transported on Air Force Two from Salt Lake City, Utah, to Phoenix, Arizona.[223] The memorial service is planned for September 21 at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.[87]

Then he tossed the playbook aside, angrily blaming the murder on the American left and vowing revenge. That was stark even for some viewers who might normally be sympathetic.
