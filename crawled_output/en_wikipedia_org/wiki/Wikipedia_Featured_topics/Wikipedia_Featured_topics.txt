Featured topics in Wikipedia
This star symbolizes the featured topics on Wikipedia.
A featured topic is a collection of inter-related articles in which at least half are featured articles or featured lists. The remaining articles must be at least good quality.
A featured topic represents Wikipedia's best work by thoroughly covering all parts of that topic through several high-quality articles that share a similar structure and are well-linked with each other.
To become featured, a topic must meet a set of criteria.
Featured topics are nominated and discussed at the Wikipedia:Featured and good topic candidates page, where they are either accepted or rejected.
Additions to existing featured topics are also discussed there. Do not add an article directly to a featured topic without nominating it first.
