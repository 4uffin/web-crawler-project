Where is the error? An exact quotation using {{!xt}} of the text in question helps.
Offer a correction if possible using {{xt}}.
References are helpful, especially when reporting an obscure factual or grammatical error.
Time zones. The Main Page runs on Coordinated Universal Time (UTC, currently 13:22 on 16 September 2025) and is not adjusted to your local time zone.
Can you resolve the problem yourself? If the error lies primarily in the content of an article linked from the Main Page, fix the problem there before reporting it here. Text on the Main Page generally defers to the articles with bolded links. Upcoming content on the Main Page is usually only protected from editing beginning 24 hours before its scheduled appearance. Before that period, you can be bold and fix any issues yourself.
Do not use {{edit fully-protected}} on this page, which will not get a faster response. It is unnecessary, because this page is not protected, and causes display problems. (See the bottom of this revision for an example.)
No chit-chat. Lengthy discussions should be moved to a suitable location elsewhere, such as the talk page of the relevant article or project.
Actual errors only. Failures of subjective criteria such as interestingness are not errors.
Respect other editors. Another user wrote the text you want changed, or reported an issue they see in something you wrote. Everyone's goal should be producing the best Main Page possible. The compressed time frame of the Main Page means sometimes action must be taken before there has been time for everyone to comment. Be civil to fellow users.
Reports are removed when resolved. Once an error has been addressed or determined not to be an error, or the item has been rotated off the Main Page, the report will be removed from this page. Check the revision history for a record of any discussion or action taken; no archives are kept.
Administrators: Clear all reports

Errors with "In the news"
Australia / PNG
Australia and Papua New Guinea have not signed the treaty yet, this story must be immediately pulled.Also, why did who ever posted the blurb go with "...that will integrate the Australian and the Papua New Guinean Defence Forces" instead of the actual proposed blurb "...that will integrate the Australian Defence Force and the Papua New Guinea Defence Force"? "Defence Force" is not a proper noun, so the current blurb would have to read "...that will integrate the Australian and the Papua New Guinean defence forces" in lowercase if we're to follow MOS:MILTERMS. Nice4What (talk · contribs) – (Thanks ♥) 03:50, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Stephen: Letting you know since I see you made the edit that shortened the blurb. Just for the future when the blurb gets reposted. Nice4What (talk · contribs) – (Thanks ♥) 03:53, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
If an admin is hesitant about pulling, changing "sign" to "announce" is an alternative/stopgap. CMD (talk) 04:17, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Changed to announce by Stephen. —Bagumba (talk) 07:03, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
What's really going on here is the anniversary of Papua New Guinea independence.
Notice that the main page is full of PNG articles – DYK, OTD, TFP – and so the ITN entry seems to be part of this.
I'm not convinced that it's really in the news or such a big deal, especially if the formalities have not been completed.
The defence pact extends existing arrangements and doesn't seem to be a marriage of equals, which rather belies the idea that PNG is fully independent. Andrew🐉(talk) 06:56, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Yeah I agree, I don't think this should have been posted when there's little concrete evidence of what it really entails and it's not in force yet, but that's a matter for ITN/C rather than ERRORS.  — Amakuru (talk) 07:57, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
What does "integrate the Australian and the Papua New Guinean defence forces" actually mean?
From the headline I assumed it meant they would merge together, which would indeed be big news.
This doesn't seem to be the case and the article is very vague on specifics, giving examples only that citizens of either country can enlist in their militaries (which is already the case in Australia for eg. British, NZ, Canadian and US citizens). It might be better to focus on the mutual defence aspect of the treaty - Dumelow (talk) 08:18, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
...last-minute roadblock explains that the delay is due to lack of approval by the PNG cabinet.
The Australian PM insists that it will still happen but he doesn't rule PNG, or does he?
I don't think we should be posting this until it's a reality.
There are many examples of parties agreeing to integrate their armed forces as part of a political peace process and it often ends in tears when powerful generals fail to fall in line. Andrew🐉(talk) 09:25, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Pulled per above (replaced with the black hole merger, which was the highest-up hook previously) -- I see serious concerns that "integrate" is a misleading headline (it seems to be a buzzword used within to play up the extent of the treaty, not the conventional meaning of "there will be one military force that covers both territories") and, more seriously still, that the treaty may not actually happen. Per many previous precedents, we wait until treaties, peace deals, appointments etc actually happen, rather than posting announcements that they will. If it can be worked up into usable fashion, it can always be re-posted. UndercoverClassicist T·C 09:42, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Regarding Charlie Kirk, and the Recent Deaths section.
I came on here the day Charlie Kirk was shot and killed at UVU, and he was listed in the Recent Deaths section of the main page.
48 hours later, he's gone from the Recent Deaths entry, but people who have been there two or three days are still in that section.
Is there any reason why Kirk was removed from that part of the main page please?
Dane|Geld 18:39, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
He has a full prose entry if you look a bit above there. We don't do RD items for people who also get prose blurbs.
-- Tamzin[cetacean needed] (they|xe|🤷) 18:42, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Because there's a whole blurb about it in In The News above, if the death is big enough for a blurb it goes there instead of Recent Deaths – filelakeshoe (t / c) 🐱 18:43, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
DYK today
Just curious, is there any reason in particular all the hooks and articles are Papua New Guinea-related? Chorchapu (talk | edits) 01:51, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Sometimes Wikipedia has themes running throughout Did You Know or even the Main Page on days that are significant to that theme. In this case, today is the 50th anniversary of Papua New Guinea's independence. Art LaPella (talk) 04:59, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oh, cool. Thank you! Chorchapu (talk | edits) 13:22, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
