This page provides a place to discuss new items for inclusion on In the news (ITN), a protected template on the Main Page (see past items in the ITN archives). Do not report errors in ITN items that are already on the Main Page here— discuss those at the relevant section of WP:ERRORS.
This candidates page is integrated with the daily pages of Portal:Current events. A light green header appears under each daily section – it includes transcluded Portal:Current events items for that day. You can discuss ITN candidates under the header.

Glossary[edit]
Blurbs are one-sentence summaries of the news story.
Altblurbs, labelled alt1, alt2, etc., are alternative suggestions to cover the same story.
A target article, bolded in text, is the focus of the story. Each blurb must have at least one such article, but you may also link non-target articles.
Articles in the Ongoing line describe events getting continuous coverage.
The Recent deaths (RD) line includes any living thing whose death was recently announced. Consensus may decide to create a blurb for a recent death.
All articles linked in the ITN template must pass our standards of review. They should be up-to-date, demonstrate relevance via good sourcing and have at least an acceptable quality.
Nomination steps[edit]
Make sure the item you want to nominate has an article that meets our minimum requirements and contains reliable coverage of a current event you want to create a blurb about. We will not post about events described in an article that fails our quality standards.
Find the correct section below for the date of the event (not the date nominated). Do not add sections for new dates manually – a bot does that for us each day at midnight (UTC).
Create a level 4 header with the article name (==== Your article here ====). Add (RD) or (Ongoing) if appropriate.
Then paste the {{ITN candidate}} template with its parameters and fill them in. The news source should be reliable, support your nomination and be in the article. Write your blurb in simple present tense. Below the template, briefly explain why we should post that event. After that, save your edit. Your nomination is ready!
You may add {{ITN note}} to the target article's talk page to let editors know about your nomination.
The better your article's quality, the better it covers the event and the wider its perceived significance (see WP:ITNSIGNIF for details), the better your chances of getting the blurb posted.
Purge this page to update the cache
Headers[edit]
When the article is ready, updated and there is consensus to post, you can mark the item as (Ready). Remove that wording if you feel the article fails any of these necessary criteria.
Admins should always separately verify whether these criteria are met before posting blurbs marked (Ready). For more guidance, check WP:ITN/A.
If satisfied, change the header to (Posted).
Where there is no consensus, or the article's quality remains poor, change the header to (Closed) or (Not posted).
Sometimes, editors ask to retract an already-posted nomination because of a fundamental error or because consensus changed. If you feel the community supports this, remove the item and mark the item as (Pulled).
Voicing an opinion on an item[edit]
Format your comment to contain "support" or "oppose", and include a rationale for your choice. In particular, address the notability of the event, the quality of the article, and whether it has been updated.
Please do...[edit]
ShortcutWP:ITNCDOWP:ITNCDO
Pick an older item to review near the bottom of this page, before the eligibility runs out and the item scrolls off the page and gets abandoned in the archive, unused and forgotten.
Review an item even if it has already been reviewed by another user. You may be the first to spot a problem, or the first to confirm that an identified problem was fixed. Piling on the list of "support!" votes will help administrators see what is ready to be posted on the Main Page.
Tell about problems in articles if you see them. Be bold and fix them yourself if you know how, or tell others if it's not possible.
Please do not...[edit]
ShortcutWP:ITNCDONTWP:ITNCDONT
Add simple "support!" or "oppose!" votes without including your reasons. Similarly, curt replies such as "who?", "meh", or "duh!" are not helpful. A vote without reasoning means little for us, please elaborate yourself.
Oppose an item just because the event is only relating to a single country, or failing to relate to one. We post a lot of such content, so these comments are generally unproductive.
Accuse other editors of supporting, opposing or nominating due to a personal bias (such as ethnocentrism). We at ITN do not handle conflicts of interest.
Comment on a story without first reading the relevant article(s).
Oppose a recurring item here because you disagree with the recurring items criteria. Discuss them here.
Use ITN as a forum for your own political or personal beliefs. Such comments are irrelevant to the outcome and are potentially disruptive.
Suggesting updates[edit]
There are two places where you can request corrections to posted items:
Anything that does not change the intent of the blurb (spelling, grammar, markup issues, updating death tolls etc.) should be discussed at WP:Errors.
Discuss major changes in the blurb's intent or very complex updates as part of the current ITNC nomination.

Article updatedRecent deaths of any person, animal or organism with a Wikipedia article are always presumed to be important enough to post (see this RFC and further discussion).

Article: Robert Redford (talk · history · tag)Recent deaths nominationBlurb:  American actor and filmmaker Robert Redford (pictured) dies at the age of 89.
(Post)News source(s): NYTimes The Guardian VarietyCredits:
Nominated by Masem (talk · give credit)
Updated by ItsShandog (talk · give credit), CheAjlt (talk · give credit), Thriley (talk · give credit) and TDKR Chicago 101 (talk · give credit)
Article updatedRecent deaths of any person, animal or organism with a Wikipedia article are always presumed to be important enough to post (see this RFC and further discussion). Comments should focus on whether the quality of the article meets WP:ITNRD.Nominator's comments: Redford's very much in reasonable territory of being a major figure in Hollywood, though I feel the article could do a bit more on legacy for this point, but I'm going to consider a blurb already here since I know it would otherwise be added later.
However, the article is unsourced in several places, so its not ready for RD yet. Masem (t) 12:19, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I agree; a major figure in Hollywood. Sxg169 (talk) 12:39, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support only for RD, well respected hollywood actor. QalasQalas (talk) 12:47, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support RD Article is well-developed and in a good enough state although the Personal life and death section is a little proselineish.
Since that covers the substantive update it could probably do with fleshing out a little.
Not supporting a blurb but not violently against one either, over the course of his career yes he really is one of the greats, but his heyday was several decades ago and I'm not sure that he reaches the requisite threshold of current popular notability, i.e. are enough readers going to actively click through to justify a blurb? 3142 (talk) 12:43, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
We don't make a distinction if a person's significance was well in the past or more recent, only that it is well demonstrated. Masem (t) 13:10, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
You may not; I do.
Notability for this purpose is a different threshold to general articles.
ITN is supposed to be a service to the readership, to enable readers to easily find articles of interest.
It is not our role to tell the reader what they should be interested in, and if no-one is the coverage is entirely pointless.
Rather it is better directed to something people are interested in. 3142 (talk) 16:35, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
"he reaches the requisite threshold of current popular notability, i.e. are enough readers going to actively click through to justify a blurb?" this is not a requirement for blurb, because we have blurbed people who are not that well-known, but yes, enough readers will actively click.

Oppose at present: too much unsourced material for MP inclusion. Would support RD only once the article is up to spec.

Support blurb. Has two Academy Awards, created Sundance. "In his ’70s heyday, few actors possessed Redford’s star wattag", "as a movie star in his prime, few could touch him". "A godfather for independent film". [1]. Has starred in three films that won Academy Award for Best Picture. That is a shoe-in for blurb.
BilboBeggins (talk) 14:05, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Simply having won or starred in award winning films is not sufficient, but it is noted that he was considered one of the great actors in part because he won those awards, in addition to the other stuff he did to promote indie films and establishing Sundance. Masem (t) 14:19, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I know that being Oscar winner only does not automatically qualify for blurb. But winning competitive Oscar and getting Honrary Award is rare, and he won almost every major award.

Comment @3142:, @The Kip:, @Masem:, @SchroCat:, @NoonIcarus:: I've expanded the legacy section which depicts Redford's impact not only as a Hollywood icon, but for his impact on Independent films and how influential he was as an activist/environmentalist. I've also beefed up the article with sources so there's no more cn tags. The argument of the blurb can be seen for his impact not just towards Hollywood films, but also for independent filmmaking and for his environmentalism efforts. --TDKR Chicago 101 (talk) 16:45, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Oppose blurb Redford was obviously a big star in his 1970s heyday but I wouldn't say he's the very most recognised and transformative US film actor of his generation. Now, one could say he doesn't need to be - he was huge, much-awarded, features in some highly-acclaimed films - but I think we as users ought to be thinking about the long game with figures like this. I don't wish to sound morbid but there are a *lot* of very notable living North American film actors in their seventies, eighties and nineties that we are likely to discuss blurbing here in the next ten years or so, most of whom made their mark at a similar time to Redford. Dick Van Dyke, Mel Brooks, Clint Eastwood, William Shatner, Robert Duvall, Alan Alda, Shirley MacLaine, Woody Allen, Warren Beatty, Jack Nicholson, Morgan Freeman, Dustin Hoffman, Jane Fonda, Elliott Gould, Jon Voight, Harvey Keitel, F. Murray Abraham, Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Faye Dunaway, Sylvester Stallone, Barbra Streisand, Harrison Ford, Goldie Hawn, Christopher Walken, Michael Douglas, Steve Martin, Tommy Lee Jones, Susan Sarandon, Diane Keaton, Arnold Schwarzenegger (he is Austrian and American), Richard Dreyfuss, Samuel L. Jackson, Meryl Streep, Sigourney Weaver, Richard Gere and John Travolta are just a few names that spring to mind. There's also various Hollywood directors (Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese, George Lucas, Steven Spielberg, James Cameron), composers (John Williams) and non-American actors nevertheless associated with US film (Rita Moreno, Julie Andrews, Michael Caine and many more). All of these people are elderly, most of them are octogenarians or older, and I think it's fair to say that quite a few of them are dead certs for blurbs. Will all of their deaths be blurbed? Perhaps not but I think it's fair to say that most of them would be proposed and that a great many of them would get through ITN with the system and attitudes we have currently. There is going to be a real deluge of these figures, for many reasons (if I was to offer a pithy summary, Hollywood boomed in the 1960s and 70s and its hits were kept alive by television and home media, becoming part of a collective experience that is less achievable today) and with that in mind, I think we perhaps need to be somewhat brutal with who gets in and who doesn't.Humbledaisy (talk) 18:19, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Elliout Gould, F. Murray Abraham, Goldie Hawn, Steve Martin are nowhere near. Dick Van Dyke never won an Oscar, so did Harvey Keitel.
And I don't see any sense of discussing the blurbs for persons who are alive. Some of persons you mentioned will be blurbed, so I don't know how them possibly being on the same scale is argument for not blurbing Redford. BilboBeggins (talk) 18:43, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
If you're not interested in discussing the blurbs for alive people, why did you tell me which ones you think are nowhere near? As I said, "I think it's fair to say that most of them would be proposed and that a great many of them would get through ITN with the system and attitudes we have currently". I didn't say I think they'll all be blurbed. I just wanted to demonstrate the sheer amount of notable, award-winning US film actors of a certain vintage and the problem it may pose to ITN.Humbledaisy (talk) 19:26, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
"If you're not interested in discussing the blurbs for alive people, why did you tell me which ones you think are nowhere near?"
I am simply saying you can't compare with Redford people you can't compare with him.
Blurb discussions taking place won't hurt anyone, if we don't want them to happen, then we should make some definite rules for blurbing. BilboBeggins (talk) 19:48, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Let's say that's 50 ppl in that list, all with a likely chance to die from old age over the next ten years. That's five whole blurbs a year, which in no way weighs down ITN, but that also assumes quality is there and that it's clear of their legacy to the industry. That last part, I don't know how true that is for all on the list., as just being a star from that period is not a indicator of being a major figure. Redfprd's significance has been demonstrated but I'm not sure if that can be said for all of them listed. Masem (t) 19:15, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I'd suggest that five US film actors a year would be quite a significant weight on ITN. Combine it with UK film actors of the same vintage and it's going to be a great amount of one kind of notable person. That's all I'm trying to say. As I say, the names were off the top of my head and to make a point - I'm by no means suggesting they'll all be nominated or all be blurbed.Humbledaisy (talk) 19:26, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
A lot of actors at RD and blurb discussions fail on sourcing, so that alone will likely cut down that list. I also doubt all of the actors you mention could get consensus to be blurbed even if the quality is sufficient. I see a few names on there that would be shoe-ins, a few that I highly doubt would make it, and a lot that could go either way. We're not going to have that much of a problem here. QuicoleJR (talk) 20:29, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support blurb based on his tangible impact on the film industry, his enduring fame, and the fact that he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom. That Legacy section is impressive. QuicoleJR (talk) 20:31, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support RD; oppose blurb – Per Humbledaisy. Arguments based on his accolades are not entirely convincing as it's somewhat expected that a high-profile actor will receive a medal or two at some point; what matters is Redford being "transformative" within his field. Not exactly a household name in the 2020s either. Nice4What (talk · contribs) – (Thanks ♥) 21:21, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Nice4What: Redford was transformative in the film industry as the founder of the Sundance Institute, whose Sundance Film Festival played a key role in the rise of indie films. QuicoleJR (talk) 21:35, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
He is one of three founders of that festival (the most high profile name of the three), so I don't think we can really call him transformative by association. The reason we are considering him for a blurb is surely about acting and I don't think we've established that he was a transformative actor. Humbledaisy (talk) 22:14, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support blurb Iconic actor worldwide. Seeing the list above convinces me that we should blurb him. It is OK to have a healthy number of blurbed deaths to balance all the sports news and the accidents news. I would argue that iconic peoples bios are more encyclopedic than minor sports or random accidents. Tradediatalk 21:51, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Very weak oppose if only because I personally believe the ICJ case to be the metaphorical “big one” that we should post, but I’m willing to strike my vote if the community disagrees. If that happens, I prefer ALT1 - ALT2 has some superfluous bits and the original blurb is awkwardly-worded. The Kip (contribs) 13:16, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose - so what? It's not like the UN will do anything about it. EF5 13:16, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support alt1 (though switch to present tense). Whether the war in Gaza constitutes a genocide has been controversial and different bodies have made different assessments. This is the closest we're ever going to get to an 'official' determination. Genocide is enormously important and recognition of one certainly merits posting as an ITN blurb, in addition to the war itself being in the ongoing section. The article is an example of our best work, very well referenced and has been carefully updated. Modest Genius talk 13:37, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Modest Genius What about the ICJ case (albeit it’ll likely be a while before the ruling is even formulated, let alone released)? The Kip (contribs) 13:41, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I am not an expert on international law, but as I understand it the ICJ is responsible for determining whether a specific person is guilty of the crime of genocide, not the broader issue of whether a genocide occurred at all. The ICJ will likely take years or decades to bring anyone to trial (if it ever happens). For example, it was clear in the late 90s that there had been a genocide in Bosnia, but it took until 2016 for the ICJ to convict Karadžić of the crime, and the ICJ's own determination was of a much narrower legal sense that excluded many aspects of the conflict. So while an ICJ conviction would be big news in itself, I don't think it's the determining factor of whether genocide occurred. As an analogy: if someone is murdered, we don't wait years for a court conviction of the specific murderer before reporting that the death was a murder. Modest Genius talk 14:10, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Modest Genius I believe what you’re defining is the ICC, not the ICJ - the ICC prosecutes individuals, the ICJ nation-states. The Kip (contribs) 14:28, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
You're right, I mixed up the courts. For Bosnia, the relevant ICJ case was in 2007 - still more than a decade after the events. So I don't think that difference fundamentally changes the reasoning. Modest Genius talk 14:50, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Question of how binding this is or what actions this triggers. With the UN declaration of famine, that seemed to establish the need for more humanitarian programs to Gaza. This is a report by a three person panel and doesn't seem to have any immediate impact or even confirmation by the UN as a whole, so it seems less significant at this point.

Strongly oppose.
The Gaza genocide article has significant verifiability issues. -- mikeblas (talk) 14:25, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Mikeblas: This was a false-positive error and due to usage of {{invoke}} for short inline references.
See the response in your topic: Talk:Gaza_genocide#missing_citations
Unless you have other concerns, can you please strike down your assertion? Bogazicili (talk) 19:01, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Verifiability concerns remain. Dozens of footnotes show warnings for footnotes that don't have matching citations. There's no realistic way to tell which of those are false alarms and which are not, other than manually visiting each. Indeed, the use of {{invoke}} seems to cause false alarms in the code that indicates a footnote has no target. The use of {{invoke}} is required because the Wiki markup parser has a limitation in the amount of text it can handle (or generate?). The article has gone through a wave of changing how it annotates its references and then uses this {{invoke}} trick, ignoring the problems it causes for verifiability.
That the workaround is necessary is a bug: an undesired limitation in functionality. The house of cards that implements -- templates, invoke, LUA scripts, code in the parser, ... -- is Byzantine and falls over easily when stressed. This is just one such article with problems.
Verifiability is one of the fundamental tenets of the encyclopedia, but the Wiki itself makes it extremely difficult to implement. The main page (and its sub features like "In the News") should not be used to showcase articles that are struggling with the parser implementation. Particularly for pages that cover sensitive and controversial subjects and must rely on easy verifiability to maintain balance and objectivity.
And so I reiterate my Strongly oppose not-vote. -- mikeblas (talk) 21:16, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Mikeblas: I am not sure if you checked the page again after recent edits. Your comment may be outdated.

Oppose, in part because of the contentious topic implications as well as the significant unaddressed question of why this report and not others meets the threshold for WP:ITNSIGNIF. Coining (talk) 17:23, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose: From the linked Reuters article (bolding by me): "The commission's 72-page legal analysis is the strongest U.N. finding to date but the body is independent and does not officially speak for the United Nations. The U.N. has not yet used the term 'genocide' but is under increasing pressure to do so." Cambalachero (talk) 17:33, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The altblurbs specify that it is an independent commission, not the UN as a whole.
–DMartin 22:03, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I Support the Alt1 blurb as concise and accurate. This has been all over the world's main news outlets and is the news lede [2] for the BBC's "flagship international news and current affairs radio programme" Newshour (for example). The other similar determinations made for instance by B'Tselem, Amnesty International, and the Médecins Sans Frontières only give further weight to the UN Commission's determination; this assessment is reflected in the editorial decisions of global newspapers to highlight their findings on their front pages. Our decision should disregard clearly false arguments that the report fails WP:ITNSIGNIF (belied by international reporting) or that the article has WP:V arguments, already resolved on the talk page. -Darouet (talk) 18:10, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
You seem to fail to get what WP:ITNSIGNIF is about. International reporting is Necessary But Not Sufficient, a story also needs consensus. Many people have pointed that, although the blurb may suggest otherwise to the unaware reader, this body is not the UN nor what it says is an official UN view on the topic.
If you want to change that, you should explain if we got it wrong somehow and this Commission is really the big deal you seem to think it is. Cambalachero (talk) 18:47, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I'm glad you brought this up. The language of Alt1 is identical to that of the most reputable news organizations. The BBC states, "a UN investigation has concluded that Israel has committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza."[3] Compare that to Alt1: "A UN Commission of Inquiry has concluded Israel has committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza." I agree with you that an editor could be, personally, confused about what that means. But the UN investigation's findings are consistent with determinations of most international and Israeli human rights organizations, which are remarkably unified in their consensus. -Darouet (talk) 19:01, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support. Prefer alt1. The report was titled: "Legal analysis of the conduct of Israel in Gaza pursuant to the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide" [4] The inquiry was headed by Navi Pillay [5], president of International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda relevant to Rwandan genocide. I don't know what does not officially speak for the United Nations means. UN is composed of different countries. Some UN bodies or officials may refrain until an official ICJ ruling in several years. But I don't think that's a reason to omit this from the news. Alt1 says A UN Commission of Inquiry, it doesn't say "The UN". So I am not sure where the confusion is in. Bogazicili (talk) 19:35, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Comment: I have just tagged the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory article for lack of NPOV, and explained it at the talk page. In short, it only mentions what the reports say and never the criticisms of such reports, even when those criticisms are already in the news pieces being cited. Cambalachero (talk) 19:36, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Question at what point does this become something that could be in the "Ongoing" with Patel saying it will "extend for years"[1] so is there a set amount of time it has to be to going on for?

Wait/Oppose Borrowing the words of Masem from the previous time this happened:
If this wasn't a cartel vessel and turns out the US hit a civilian ship, as to start a larger conflict, that might be a reason to post, but there's no indication that anything has been massively escalated due to this. Currently, I feel this lacks any impact to post. 5.57.242.223 (talk) 15:38, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

I just noticed 2025 US Caribbean naval deployment is the target article for this blurb. Wouldn't 2025 United States strikes on Venezuelan boats be a better target article seeing how the article focuses on the strikes themselves rather than just describing them in passing like 2025 US Caribbean naval deployment does?

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez publicly supported the protests. Turini2 (talk) 13:15, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I feel the focus here is less about the results and more on the race's disruption by the protestors, given that the race itself isn't ITNR and best as I can tell hasn't been posted before. Masem (t) 14:08, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Support usually this wouldn't meet WP:ITNSIGNIF as not usually as much coverage as the Tour de France.

Joseph2302 (talk) 14:24, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Strong support per Joseph; this is getting enough coverage to be worthy of being put in the news. Also, let’s put “Vuelta a España” in bold, per 2604’s vote (which is now deleted). 64.114 etc 15:44, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Just a procedural note that I deleted the IP vote due to ECR - given the context of the race’s cancellations/protests, I figured it fell under the ARBPIA area enough for ECR to be in effect. The Kip (contribs) 16:02, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
What is ECR? 64.114 etc 16:03, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

@64.114 etc The broadly-construed (i.e. anything even tangentially related) WP:ARBPIA area is subject to the extended-confirmed restriction, meaning that an editor has to be logged-in and extended-confirmed (account age of at least 30 days + at least 500 edits) in order to edit articles/content related to the Arab–Israeli (more often just Israeli–Palestinian) conflict.

+1, there are plenty of sporting events that get posted due to the notability of a particular event despite not being ITN/R!
Turini2 (talk) 07:13, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose as per The Kip. The race itself is not ITNR and the protests are covered by ongoing. --MtPenguinMonster (talk) 23:26, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support The race not being ITNR is not really relevant, as sporting events which are not ITNR can still successfully pass the criteria independently. Also, I don't think a bike race in Spain with pro-Palestine protests is so proximate to the Gaza war that it is 100% covered by ongoing. Because neither of those factors are dispositive, that leads me to conclude this can be posted. The protests together with general hype around Jonas Vingegaard have pushed it over the line; this is evidenced by the widespread international coverage as well as domestic political attention. FlipandFlopped ㋡ 03:41, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Flipandflopped there’s generally been a consensus that Gaza war protests fall under the Gaza war ongoing item. The Kip (contribs) 13:20, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support This is a Grand Tour comparable with the Tour de France and the protests seem to have been quite disruptive.

It is incredibly rude to call a AGF nomination of a major sports results as "trivia". If you don't like sports, fine, but sports results are something we post commonly, and we do not require a sports results to be ITNR to be posted. That said, where we do have multiple ITNR for a specific sport, the posting of a non-ITNR sports results can be seen as lacking the significance as those listed at ITN.

Oppose on notability Results from the most significant sporting events may warrant a blurb; this isn't one of them. Dr Fell (talk) 22:43, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Comment Not sure why people considers this championship trivial since no reasoning was given in either case. I'm not sure either why it's not on the ITN/R list seeing how it's a reoccurring championship that is held every four years. That said, I concur with Howard the Duck in that the EuroBasket 2025 final should be the target article as with most other championship blurbs. I feel either article is not ready as the former has sourcing issues and the article about the final lacks prose. 5.57.242.223 (talk) 09:25, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose on notability and quality pretty sure this gets nominated most years, and rejected. Don't see coverage to meet WP:ITNQUALITY. And I certainly see no match summary prose on EuroBasket 2025 (the only reasonable target bold article- strongly oppose ALT0 with player listed in bold, as they're not the main focus of the event).

Support on notability,
The Independent, The Mirror, CNN, BBC Sport, Al Jazeera. Boxing seems underrepresented at ITN, in the past decade we've only posted Mayweather-McGregor, Mayweather-Pacquiao, and Usyk-Fury Kowal2701 (talk) 10:58, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
LOL we've posted more boat races than boxing fights in the last 10 years? Howard the Duck (talk) 13:38, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Boxing is difficult because there's nothing like a championship series, only various title matches to determine who the belt-holder is in a given weight class. That's where here, that multiple sources saying having the title in three different weight classes makes this significant. Masem (t) 16:24, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
There are more boxing title fights in a month that boat races in a decade, but we still have posted more boat races than boxing fights in the past 10 years, despite the fact we haven't posted boat races for years now (LOL). Howard the Duck (talk) 16:29, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Exactly that there are that many title fights in a month is why its hard to see what makes sense to post for boxing, because of how routine title fights are. This case is different, due to the multiple titles now held by Crawford. (That s, this is news because of that achievement, not because of the fight itself). Masem (t) 16:34, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
It also doesn’t help that every title fight is promoted as "fight of the century" etc. Kowal2701 (talk) 10:43, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Comment I started work on a Fight Details section and I'll look into expanding the rest of the article to put it up to standards. I don't see why this doesn't pass for notability as some voters have suggested, a three-division undisputed world champion last happened by Henry Armstrong and that was in the 1930s. HadesTTW (he/him • talk) 17:38, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
It's unclear why it was notable then, either. This seems more like pub trivia. I can't imagine a newspaper running this on a front page – or even as a lead story in the Sport section. Perhaps a candidate for a future Did You Know. Dr Fell (talk) 22:51, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Oppose. While certainly INTERESTING, I do believe "undisputed in three weight classes" is something that falls in the trivia category. And I don't get this claim that boxing is underrepresented at ITN - we literally posted the first undisputed heavyweight championship in years when Usyk won it the first time, IIRC. All due respect to Crawford and his accomplishment, but I don't think being the undisputed super middleweight champion has the same pomp, at the very least if we're going by what the public is interested in. DarkSide830 (talk) 16:58, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Weak Oppose Mostly on notability grounds.
Crawford was already champion, did this change anything? –DMartin 22:45, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Crawford was WBA light middleweight champion; Canelo Álvarez was the undisputed super middleweight champion, and the titles on the line were Álvarez's championships. What changed was Álvarez no longer champion, and Crawford is now the undisputed super middleweight champion, aside from being WBA light middleweight champion. Howard the Duck (talk) 23:58, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Where's Andrew Davidson to point out that Canelo Álvarez vs. Terence Crawford had more page views than 2024–25 UEFA Champions League and 2025 UEFA Champions League final combined on the respective days of the event? Howard the Duck (talk) 00:10, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Updated and nominated by Chipmunkdavis (talk · give credit)
Article updatedNominator's comments: Substantial and unusual announcement of a "totally" integrated military, even allowing for potential ministerial hyperbole. Both militaries will be able to hire the others' citizens. The agreement comes in the context of growing competition for influence in the Pacific with China, as well as with the symbolic 50th anniversary of one country's independence from the other. This story will go on for a couple of days, with formal signing expected in the next day or two. (The agreement itself probably sits on the edge of notability at the moment, will likely become much more firmly notable in the near future.) CMD (talk) 20:17, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose Good faith nom, however there are some issues I have with this nomination; A) the target article is not directly primarily about the subject. I feel personally that ITN blurbs should target either the dedicated articles about the subject/event of the blurb or have substantial focus of the subject/event. There is currently relatively little prose about the announcement in the target article. B) I feel most treaty signings/announcements in general are a bit run of the mill to blurb C) relatively low impact/coverage globally. 5.57.243.123 (talk) 21:40, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Support in principle, but wait until full treaty details are revealed — The integration of two militaries, recruitment permitted from either side, along with a pathway to citizenship. I would change the blurb though: "strengthen ties" doesn't mean anything in particular, and "ahead of the latter's independence anniversary" is trivia. A better altblurb could come up the details of the treaty are released. Nice4What (talk · contribs) – (Thanks ♥) 23:13, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Not saying it has to be in the blurb, but the independence anniversary is not trivia but part of the story. The treaty is being specifically timed for the event, no doubt part of both countries weaving that narrative of how ties remain close past independence etc. CMD (talk) 08:10, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Nominated by 82.132.187.52 (talk · give credit)
Nominator's comments: Part the wider "2025 British anti-immigration protests" (see that Wikipedia page). Seems significant that there are only 5,000 counter protestors (but that may be due to the police, not a lack of will). 82.132.187.52 (talk) 16:18, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Strong oppose the current blurb if nothing else. Considering the population of the United Kingdom is in the range of 60,000,000, 110,000,000 seems a bit of an odd estimate to me. The article cited in the page 2025 British anti-immigration protests cites 100,000. I want to see an article for Unite the Kingdom be created, or for there to be more than a one paragraph update at the target on it. Departure– (talk) 16:26, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
There was an article, but it seems to have vanished. I can only assume the current offical estimate of 110k has been put out because it sounds less scary than the "more than 100,000" that your cite actually says. Worth noting that London itself has under 10 million people, and the biggest ever march in London was probably the 1.5 million who opposed the Iraq War. But 110k is not exactly small, and it definitely feels significant that they now outnumber the counter protesters by 20 to 1. It would be helpful to know why. 82.132.187.52 (talk) 16:51, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose While large in size, this seems to have lacked any significant impact - non-violent (good), no expected change yet as a result (compared to, for example, the Nepal protests). Masem (t) 17:04, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
That's not how UK politics/protest works. The significance is the size, specifically that in the eyes of the organizers it has been a huge success (true mass attendance, headline news, failure of the counter protest). You will never see a UK Prime Minister stand down or change policy under these circumstances. Arguably he already made a significant change to satisfy them, he just did it before the protest actually happened. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce9rg9jj5kro Do not compare Nepal (or America) to the UK, they are (wildly) different countries. 82.132.187.163 (talk) 18:30, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
There is pretty much some protest going on somewhere in the world at any time, we have to be selective of what protests make sense to post to avoid ITN from becoming a protest tracker. A large but otherwise non-violent protest is very low on importance, compared to one that has caused an entire govt to collapse. Masem (t) 18:46, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
It doesn’t sound like you've put much thought into this at all. Would I be wrong in assuming you don't really have the first clue who Tommy Robinson, Nigel Farage, Shabana Mahmood or Kier Starmer even are? If the answer is no, then respectfully, please recognise you're probably not qualified to even give an opinion on what is and is not a significant protest in the UK. Your entire comment is inapplicable to the UK context - neither the poll tax protests of the 1990s or the Iraq War protests of the 2000s led to a change of government. But most will identify those as the two most significant political protests in recent UK history. Neither led to any immediate consequences, because that's not the British way of doing things. The day a mass protest in the UK leads to an immediate change in government, is the day Wikipedia will be completely irrelevant, because that will surely be the day something will have gone seriously wrong in the UK at large. Unimaginably wrong. 82.132.187.163 (talk) 19:39, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Anyone is allowed to voice their opinion at an open discussion of a matter like this and regionalism being used to gatekeep consensus building of such by suggesting someone outside of the area is "probably not qualified to even give an opinion" is not helpful in the slightest. Masem has a good point here, in my opinion, regardless of their knowledge of UK politics. The same argument could be used for a similar protest anywhere else in the world, because the substance of the argument is the same regardless of the specific people it concerns. Departure– (talk) 19:53, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
How is it a good point? Unless I have misunderstood it, it's a de facto ban on considering any political protest significant if it occurred in a non-violent politically stable country. Which is obviously nonsense because this is an encyclopedia where all countries are equally relevant, not a tabloid which only concerns itself with eye catching chaotic countries. Who benefits from this approach? Masem can't even answer that if he has absolutely no idea how many times his argument will have meant a politically significant protest in the UK has been rejected by Wikipedia. 82.132.187.163 (talk) 21:13, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
My point is that there are far too many protests that occur on a routine basis that to give any protest that lacks any clear and immediate impact a space on ITN would be too low of a bar and would lead to us likely to post protests on a nearly-daily basis. ITN is not a newspaper and is meant to feature quality articles that reflect the coverage in the news, and for the most part, non-violent protests tend to get minimal news treatment (even locally), whereas those with immediate effects often get far wider coverage that justifies the reason to post them.
This is nothing about UK politics, because the same is true for US politics or EU politics or the like. Masem (t) 23:34, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I'm going to add that at this stage the protests are still not ITN, but they are also still occurring with some heating up (a dozen some ppl arrested today). It could turn worse at which point that would become more likely as an ITN. Masem (t) 13:20, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Oppose. Notably large and yet another indicator of an ideological shift in Great Britain, but large political rallies are rarely if ever prominent enough for ITN.
Nepal’s “protests” were destructive riots followed by an overthrow of government. UtK is unlikely to be an inflection point. Current Events is the right home for this. Dr Fell (talk) 18:33, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Why are people even comparing this protest to what happened in Nepal? It's nonsense. There are sound reasons to believe this is already an era defining inflection point in UK politics, induced by protests. It stands in stark contrast to how this and other recent governments have reacted to mass but peaceful protests. This exact government has already flatly refused to give in to several rallies held for gaza, climate, welfare and tax policy. Their response to this movement is different. They're in an existential crisis, with Reform UK having already effectively destroyed the other mainstream UK party. There's the significance, for anyone who doesn't really understand the subtleties of how things now work in this peaceful two party democracy in a post-2008 world. Perhaps because they're numbed to the chaos of Trump's America, or the general violence seen elsewhere. This is not normal. The complete failure of the counter protest, is the truly scary part. That's new. 82.132.187.163 (talk) 20:20, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Because the events in Nepal quickly and directly led to a change in government. This isn't a venue to discuss politics only the notability of events. If UtK results in Starmer making a notable concession to the demands of the protesters or if it results in a collapse of his government, those events could be worth an ITN item. (I don’t see how Starmer can shift much to the right before he starts losing MPs to the fledgling Your Party.) There has to be a notable event for this to be featured news. The Met estimate is 110,000 attendees. I've seen reports that the actual number is higher but cannot find a reliable source with a solid estimate. The Iraq War protest in 2003 had over a million in attendance. The UtK rally would need numbers that high to be significant enough on its own to warrant mention. Or it would need to produce a significant political development – policy concession, MP defections in large numbers, leadership challenge, general election called, etc. Finally, to use somewhat fiery language, the 2025 British anti-immigration protests article that would be linked to is in a sorry state. Rather than documenting the event and offering balanced analysis, it’s overtly biased. Dr Fell (talk) 21:37, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Comment As of now, Unite the Kingdom rally is a redirect to the page 2025 British anti-immigration protests, but there is no prose on the 13 September rally outside the lede, itself uncited. Departure– (talk) 18:58, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose The No Kings protest saw a higher percentage of the country and a higher total number of people protest, and it wasn't posted. Protests only become notable enough for ITN when they lead to immediate change or some sort of riot, and until that happens, it won't be posted. Elipticon (talk) 20:18, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Whoever decided that should be the rule, is an idiot. It's a de facto ban on noting any significant political protests in the UK. I can't think of a single protest in recent UK history that would ever meet this ridiculous criteria, biased as it is toward violent and politically unstable chaotic countries. And for what purpose? Only a fool would think UK politics is not something the readers of Wikipedia are interested in, surely.

Exactly. Some people here seem to think the words riot and protest are interchangeable, or worse, the word riot simply means significant protest.

Oppose, immigration is always in the news in the UK, so it is not like this came out of nowhere (If it did, it would probably be more notable). Sahaib (talk) 20:33, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose, another nothing-burger in the grand scheme of immigration-related news in the UK. No change of government, no deaths, no widespread massive chaos.. not really worthy for ITN. Kline • talk • contribs 21:27, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
What a ridiculous opinion. People must be off their heads if they genuinely think the UK would change its government due to a peaceful protest of even this size. When the hell has that even happened? They must be barking mad if it genuinely takes people dying before Wikipedia should deem a "protest" to be significant. The word is PROTEST, not riot or revolution. Similarly if they want to see widespread chaos. The UK isn't France, it is perfectly possible for 100,000 people to make their opinions known without bringing the country to a halt. What you moronically call a "nothing burger" is a very large protest speaking to a very major issue that everyone here is hoping doesn’t get so badly handled it leads to a change of government any time soon, because that would be very very bad. But at least then, when the violence really erupts and centuries of political orthodoxy is overturned, maybe then you might deem it worthy. At which point, who the hell would care anyway? How self important do you people really imagine you are, if you assume a world where a country as important as the UK is, is in such dire straits over such an explosive issue that there is widespresd chaos and deaths and changes in government, anyone would still have the time or inclination to bother with Wikipedia at all? If the UK government is ever toppled by a mass march, that would probably be about the same time the USA is in a full scale civil war. So good luck with that. Hard to keep charity funded servers online in such a scenario, I would have thought. 82.132.186.240 (talk) 23:39, 13 September 2025 (UTC) Stuck!, Harassment to the editor.ROY is WAR Talk! 10:25, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

With the update, the blurb would be posted as a September 12 event, not September 11. We should wait. No rush, please. ArionStar (talk) 19:59, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Given that the sentence was known to happen soon, sure. But normally, sentencing in cases like this comes weeks to months later, which is why we have nearly always posted at conviction, not sentencing, when the story is actually in te news. Masem (t) 22:29, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

In addition to what Nfitz pointed out, the consequences of these decisions are very different. Previously, he was barred from running for office for eight years. Now he is sentenced to 27 years in prison. There is a big difference between those two restrictions/sentences. I don't see this story as a "repeat" of the previous one, even if it might build on the previous 2023 story in some way. 98.170.164.88 (talk) 23:52, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Distinction without a difference. It's about Bolsonaro's legal woes either way, and over the same stuff to boot (they are not two unrelated cases over different things). The point is, this story has already been posted, and only details changed. Cambalachero (talk) 00:42, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

You shouldn't switch what is the target article without gaining consensus on its quality first. Its fine to link the trial article without bolding, but we'd need discussion to consider it as featured. Masem (t) 15:32, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
What Masem said. The "supports" above were for the coup article to be bolded, which provides a much better introduction to the topic for those who might not have been following this news. Moscow Mule (talk) 17:34, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
That's getting into the weeds (that they haven't actual read the sentence to him and the post-reading dealings that might go on to reduce it).
Also, the coup plot article is far better quality than the trial article, though it can still be linked, just not bolded. Masem (t) 15:29, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Oppose: A single academic paper publishing a result not yet independently confirmed or peer-reviewed is not newsworthy. Definitely feels this is being pushed more than a bit too aggressively into ITN. Should this get a gong, it should be posted beneath the Charlie Kirk assassination story. Dr Fell (talk) 19:27, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
This is absolutely a peer reviewed paper. Masem (t) 19:55, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I retract "or peer-reviewed" but remain opposed. Highly suspect why this is being pushed so hard. So many supports without any actual article in place. And again, the first report of an initial finding does not rise to the level an ITN item. This is comparable to yesterday's signs of life on Mars story. Dr Fell (talk) 20:13, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
"Highly suspect"?
Seriously, it's a remarkable confirmation of two of the most important predictions from Einstein's General Relativity, made back in the 60's and 70's. Roy Kerr is a potential Nobelist even. There is absolutely no comparison with the life on Mars story, which is excellent but rather minor xenochemistry, with a marginal xenobiology hook that isn't going anywhere for perhaps decades to come.
And for the record, we've covered ITN scientific results based on first peer-reviewed publication.
I am the IP who nominated this item, and I am also the IP who removed the "Ready" tag.
The point of Support is to see get one or the other candidate target 128.91.40.237 (talk) 21:52, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Have you looked at the author list? It's huge (I didn't count but its over 50). Its one of those papers that they likely collaborated heavily between different research schools and other groups to make sure the results were as they determined. Add the peer review by the publication itself, and any "highly suspect" aspect is just not there. Maybe if this was from a small group from some no-name school, then we could have some doubt, but that's simply not the case here. Masem (t) 02:23, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I don't doubt the paper. But I found – and still find – it suspect this was being pushed into ITN so forcefully with so many blind Supports before an appropriate article was ready. Dr Fell (talk) 04:50, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Comment - the IP editor and Black Kite are right. How can you have a target article which does not even mention the update, and the other article GW250114 is a 2-sentence stub? This is not ready. - Indefensible (talk) 20:30, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Those articles are equally incomprehensible. What is a "Kerr black hole overtone"? We don't actually have an article on "Kerr black hole"; that redirects to Kerr metric, which doesn't offer a quick definition of "Kerr black hole". It also doesn't include the word "overtone" anywhere. (For the record, I've been editing Wikipedia since 2005, so you don't need to be snarky.) Zagalejo (talk) 00:05, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

It is still extremely stubby but could easily be fixed by adding a paragraph or two to frame why this analysis is important.

Respectfully, I'm going to remove the "Ready" label for now, which should be used for items that are obviously ready given a clear consensus. Currently, it does not appear clear at all. The article is a start-class article, and the alt blurb III is confusing, as one cannot claim "Two black holes merge" in the present tense. Rather, it's the observation and publication of the findings that is the current event. Another admin can evaluate it differently but for now, I think it's not accurate to label it ready. - Fuzheado | Talk 15:12, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Strong oppose. I revised the blurb a while ago at the lower ITN and it's a lot more complicated and a lot less concrete than this blurb posits:
An article published in Nature announces that the Perseverance rover discovered vivianite, greigite, and various organic compounds in rocks at Cheyava Falls on Mars, in what Administrator of NASA Sean Duffy claims may be "the clearest sign of life that we’ve ever found on Mars". While greigite can be produced without the influence of life, current geological models of Mars do not support that the rocks were formed above 250 °C (482 °F), the temperature needed to form the mineral in a laboratory. (The New York Times)
It's equally likely that Mars' geological models are wrong or another event caused the greigite formations. Per EF5, we really shouldn't be jumping the gun for the discovery that we aren't alone in the universe, and official statements for whether or not this is a sign of life have all used an awful lot of weaselly and uncertain language (again, for the discovery of a singe mineral that doesn't conclusively prove life exists on Mars).

It appears that the next step for the samples would be a return to Earth for closer study but that is years away and uncertain because of budget cuts. Andrew🐉(talk) 06:35, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
There are several benchmarks that must be met between a discovery of this caliber and a clear and explicit "We found extraterrestrial life!" statement. They have to rule out contamination and errors in the readings, rule out all abiotical explanations, find a second and independent discovery, etc. All those will take years. If this is life indeed, the news will not be now, it will be in some years and be something like this:; "Remember when we thought we found life on Mars in 2025? Yeah, it took years, but it's confirmed!" Cambalachero (talk) 18:12, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support This seems to be a significant finding; for example, National Geographic, "This is the best evidence yet for ancient life on Mars".
The uncertainty seems inevitable as fossil microbes are hard to be sure about.
As it will be years before more detailed analysis, it seems reasonable to report the finding now, while it's in the news. Andrew🐉(talk) 06:32, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support although I agree with Chorchapu that the bolded article should be Cheyava Falls. Just because it isn't a confirmed finding doesn't mean it's not newsworthy or unencyclopedic. The "best evidence yet" for alien life actually sounds quite significant and interesting for the reader. It's also refreshing to have a non-political blurb every once in a while. 9ninety (talk) 06:47, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Oppose Theories based on indicative findings that life exists or existed below Mars's surface or in Venus's high atmosphere have been published in reputable peer-reviewed journals for decades, but those are just minor stepping stones that haven't yet led to more general conclusions.--Kiril Simeonovski (talk) 07:22, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

The close was bad as the discussion had only lasted for about 90 minutes and the opposes were low quality.
This is respectable science based on a peer-reviewed paper in Nature and is getting reasonably serious coverage in the mainstream media.
Science, by its nature, is usually provisional rather than being a sure thing and this observation seems significant in moving the evidence-base forward.
The item deserves proper consideration. Andrew🐉(talk) 09:12, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I'm not going to close this again, but I'm going to starkly oppose the characterization of the close as bad. When I closed this under WP:SNOW, there were 11 opposes to 0 supports beyond the nom. Departure– (talk) 17:45, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Strong support: Sources have consistently noted this to be the "best evidence yet," "strongest evidence yet," "biggest clue," or "clearest sign" of ancient life on Mars. Found as unique and significant by NPR, AP, NatGeo, CNN, Reuters, CBC, BBC, Live Science, NYT, PBS, Scientific American, among others. This is one of the most central scientific questions to humanity! Yes, it isn't definitive proof, but that's what empiricism and peer review is about; it's slow and cautious. We also must note this finding is about a year old, just slowed down by peer review and extended review of alternative explanations. That they've gone this far and still find it to be the strongest piece of evidence yet of extraterrestrial life is very much newsworthy on its own. Again, the media (including both popular and scientific news) seems to agree with this with their reporting of it as the best finding yet in this subject area. LaborHorizontal (talk) 09:52, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Completly agree. The fact Wikipedia refuses to post real, significant, ground-breaking and peer reviewed science in its home page, but immediatelly posts the shooting of a random person in the US that has absolutely zero international recogniziton, is a joke. I will note that the search for life on Mars has been considered the top priority in planetary exploration in the last two decades by the Planetary Science Decadal Survey and the findings in this study reaffirm the importance of the Mars Sample Return mission many want to cancel. And to those saying this finding is "inconclusive": Science is never conclusive. The discovery of extraterrestrial life will not be like in the movies where scientists suddently find a random worm moving in the surface. Science is always slow and methodical and the fact the researches in this study remain cautious is a good thing. The fact remains that this is the greatest evidence of extraterrestrial life yet.
I
support the nomination. Agile Jello (talk) 10:29, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Agile Jello: I disagree. While many social sciences are inconclusive and similar findings may be considered significant, astrobiology is quite rigorous and the question 'Has there ever been life on Mars?' has a simple 'Yes' or 'No' answer. This finding is only a partial result that points out that life may have existed on Mars, but it simply doesn't provide sufficient evidence to make a general conclusion (this is like getting to a partial result that solves the Collatz conjecture in mathematics). So, either there has or there has not been life on Mars, and the answer is 'No' until it's proved to be 'Yes'. We don't need to post every step in the indefinite process of attempting to refute the current answer.--Kiril Simeonovski (talk) 11:57, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I disagree. Finding life on other planets is extremely difficult and unless aliens come visit us it's highly unlikely our first evidence of life would be something definitive. Even saying that there is a simple answer to life existing on Mars is wrong as we don't know how life on other worlds would look like and how it could be at the boundary between geological and biological processes. Also, saying that is the answer is "no" before it's proved is extremely dangerous and unscientific as it goes against the idea of scientific skepticism (the correct answer would be "we don't know"). And yes, we should post major scientific discoveries in all fields even if they are not conclusive. This is the type of content an encyclopedia should embrace the most. Enough with these useless US-centric political dramas, sports events, and random tragedies with no long-term impact in the world that get posted just because x people died. Agile Jello (talk) 13:07, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
In science, the answer is ‘No’ until it’s proved otherwise (the null hypothesis is that there’s no extraterrestrial life). You can use the phrase ‘we don’t know’ in philosophy where it has elaborated interpretations. An encyclopaedia documents verified knowledge, not someone’s beliefs or partial results based on assumptions. I agree that Wikipedia should cover more scientific stories on the main page, but this is definitely not one of them. --Kiril Simeonovski (talk) 16:06, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Strong support. As per LaborHorizontal, sources have consistently noted this the best evidence of ancient life on Mars. 24.84.42.180 (talk) 14:22, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Precedent FYI, there was a previous posting in 2018,
NASA reports the discovery of complex organic molecules in samples collected by Curiosity from the Gale crater on Mars.
That wasn't conclusive either. Andrew🐉(talk) 10:35, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose I think we've got a couple issues here, first that how many times can NASA or other groups say "we've found evidence of life on Mars" before it becomes a "cry wolf" situation, so any further claim really needs to drive towards irrefutable evidence. To which my second point, the lead researcher on this, quoted by BBC, even warns this is not strong evidence but merely a driver to study these formations more, quoting "We have found features in the rocks that if you saw them on Earth could be explained by biology - by microbial process. So we're not saying that we found life, but we're saying that it really gives us something to chase." Even they aren't saying its evidence, just an avenue they are asking to persue. Masem (t) 12:06, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support – Cheyava Falls can use some structural work, but these are two lovely articles regardless. The "discovery" of extraterrestrial life was always going to be a very slow and gradual process, but that doesn't mean we can't celebrate every step on the way. It always feels like a great excuse to show off the work we've done on Perseverance (rover) over the past years as well. If only every field had big news stories like this every few years; that would make our job for ITN a lot easier. Perseverence and life on Mars are in the news, so it would be a nice feature. ~Maplestrip/Mable (chat) 12:37, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Oppose generally per above. While I understand that we've posted a similar story before, the word "potential" still is pulling a lot of weight here. While I think we generally know that the process to deducing ancient life on other planets would not be as simple as just finding a fossil or something, the article itself only contains a small subsection on this discovery, which again is largely qualified by the use of "potential" and "possible". Perhaps one day this specific discovery will be considered a big step in confirming the existence of extraterrestrial life, but at this point, that is still TBD. DarkSide830 (talk) 18:00, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

STRONGEST SUPPORT. Noteworthy news story, with news sources complimenting the discovery (“greatest discovery”, etc.). 207.194.85.134 (talk) 21:50, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose for now it's a story for enthusiasts. Per the BBC page, "The only way to fully confirm if the minerals were made by microbes would be to bring the rocks back to Earth for analysis. A Mars sample return mission has been proposed by Nasa and Esa but its future looks highly uncertain." Which means it's going to remain a story for enthusiasts for years more. Banedon (talk) 08:44, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Weak support: It's a notable find, and per Departure, it could still shake up our understanding of the Red Planet and its geology. However, per EF5 and Departure, this is a potential sign of life, and it could very well turn out to be anything. Besides, it's always best to tread carefully when reporting on such big scientific headlines, since it's the nature of science that things can and do get disproved at any moment.

Turning Point USA is an important contributor to the agenda of the current
neo-fascist regime in the USA. Donald Trump himself has previously called Charlie Kirk an important contributor to the trumpist agenda. They receive millions in donations from megadonors, which give Charlie Kirk undeniable platform to influence young people (Trump himself calling it an "army of young people" on Twitter). Furthermore, acts of political violence should be considered significant news, this will surely create significant ripples in the US political discourse. The Associated Press has called him a "major figure in US conservative politics" (https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/article/turning-point-founder-has-been-a-key-figure-in-building-support-for-republicans-among-young-people/) GreatMageMai (talk) 20:29, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Wait as there's basically no details out. The most important is whether he survived the shooting or not. If he did, then I doubt that this is that significant to post. If he passed away, then it'd be blurbed not due to his stature (the part everyone around here harps upon for ITN deaths) but rather the nature of the death: yes, shootings are common, but politically-motivated assassinations are rare & startling enough in the world that I recall we pretty much always blurb them unless part of a larger event already listed in ITN. Nottheking (talk) 20:23, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
What do you mean, "his stature"?
As I said above, most of the world has never heard of him and looking at his article he does not seem to be a particularly important political figure. As far as I can see, he mostly seems to be famous for promoting conspiracy theories. Black Kite (talk) 20:26, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The point they were making is that his stature was small and that that isn’t relevant. A
political figure was assassinated due to their politics (if he dies). They’re making the point that that is relevant enough. 1brianm7 (talk) 20:31, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Yes, I misread that, but it makes my point; how important does someone have to be to qualify for a blurb if they are shot dead in a country which has thousands of gun deaths a year?
I would say; more important than Kirk, unless the shooting has further consequences down the line, and anything is possible with the current administration. Black Kite (talk) 20:38, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
If Kirk dies, it was because he was assassinated. The U.S. does not have thousands of assassinations per year. The last major assassination by my count, was in June, of a state representative, somebody who was much less politically prominent than Kirk (and who got on ITN). If political figures were getting assassinated everyday, you’d have a point, but they aren’t. 1brianm7 (talk) 20:43, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Yes, but you're missing my point.
If an elected political figure was assassinated, then clearly that's a major story.
But Kirk is a political activist in a country where there are a lot of political activists.
Plus see my reply to TDKR Chicago 101 below. Black Kite (talk) 20:47, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
That's like saying that there's a 'lot of humans' therefore no human's death should ever be blurbed. You're straying from the important part, is that political assassinations in the entire western world are rare. Nottheking (talk) 23:56, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose even if he unfortunately passes away. It is a tragic event involving a media figure in the United States, but strictly domestic in a country where gun violence is more than routine.

Strong oppose - non-fatal shooting of a private individual holding no office. If he died unremarkably I'd imagine a blurb nomination would be opened but pushed down, and him surviving an assassination attempt means little on the world scale. Turning Point Action isn't at the top of my list for American conservative groups, either in influence, notoriety, or numbers; a lot of people helped Trump win 2024. The blurb should mention Turning Point Action, if this does end up being posted, however. Departure– (talk) 20:47, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Strong support blurb. I think the main argument should be how rare it is for a politically motivated assassionation in the U.S. to occur. Sure Kirk is a notable right-wing commentator/influencer but the manner of this death: a young man being publicly assassinated in front of a big crowd, well, that's the story right there. That is pretty rare. For a figure so prominent on the news/political scene to be gunned down in public.
--TDKR Chicago 101 (talk) 20:39, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
A good faith question, though; if the news story is a very rare politically motivated shooting (and I admit they are rare - there's the Trump one, but let's not go there), should it matter if Kirk dies or not?
Either the event is notable or it isn't. Black Kite (talk) 20:45, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Support blurb on notability, though I think it should probably say "shot and killed" rather than "assassinated" as that seems to be more in line with article title conventions per WP:KILLINGS (blurb text and title should ideally match). The public killing of a comparatively high-profile individual like this warrants a blurb. Frankly, I think this should probably have been blurbed even if it had been non-fatal, compare e.g. Stabbing of Salman Rushdie, which we blurbed.

Support blurb - although he wasn't elected to office, Kirk was arguably far more influential and had a greater notoriety than the Minnesota and Colombian lawmakers who were assassinated earlier this year, both of whom received a blurb. Regardless, a RD should be posted immediately. schetm (talk) 21:26, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I maintain an oppose on this blurb per other reasons; Turning Point Action really isn't the loudest nor most influential in US politics, and while similar shootings such as this year's on legislators have been posted, I'd like to add that there was a consensus against posting Jean-Marie Le Pen's blurb, despite him founding National Rally, one of the biggest contemporary conservative organizations that was well above the importance of Turning Point. Kirk's influence on US and thus world politics was minimal compared to Le Pen, and nor too did Kirk hold any office, nor do anything notable enough to warrant a blurb in my eyes. I haven't seen the article's quality and will hold out on a !vote in that regard for now. Departure– (talk) 21:26, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Its one thing on the article itself where there is room for sourcing and/or attribution for using contentious terms and labels (including if appropriate stating as fact but with immediate sourcing), but at ITN we absolutely should not be including those terms.

Post-posting support Seems to pass WP:ITNSIGNIF. This is being covered in all major American news outlets, and many non-American outlets, with frequent updates. I was surprised by how quickly this blurb was posted to ITN, but I don't necessarily see that as a problem. To respond to a couple of the objections above:(1) Systemic bias is indeed an issue to address, but "US-centrism" is not a good reason to oppose the posting of any given US story, per WP:ITNATA. A better way to address systemic bias would be to nominate more stories from other parts of the world. (2) His level of significance is hard to assess objectively and depends on what metric you look at. He was not necessarily a universally famous household name in the US, but I think many who follow US politics, especially in younger generations, had at least heard of him. His article was the #10 most viewed page on Wikipedia:WikiProject Conservatism/Popular pages and #44 on Wikipedia:WikiProject Politics/Popular pages prior to his death, which I think says something.

Mild oppose on quality. The citations include a lot of social media posts (albeit official accounts, but secondary sources are preferred) and the tabloid TMZ. Only admins can edit it so it's not easy to fix or add more reliable sources. Perhaps the bolded link could be changed to Charlie Kirk or the blurb could be changed to RD.

Allowing myself the liberty of a post-posting oppose. I've been bouncing this one off the walls of my brain for the better part of the night, and have come to the conclusion that (I'm gonna be terse) all things considered the murder is notable in that it's sudden and shocking. For me, nothing else. --Ouro (blah blah) 06:30, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support There's a remarkable level of interest in this.
For example, the number of readers for the Charlie Kirk article yesterday was about 15 million, which is enormous as these things go.
The top read stats show high traffic for a large cloud of article titles associated with the incident and so readers are clearly looking for our articles and our purpose is to help them find them. Andrew🐉(talk) 06:46, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Post-posting support per above. Major news event, 100% notable. His words during his speech before he died was so impactful and powerful to everyone. During that time he was dressed in a white shirt with the word "Freedom", which is very important not just for Americans, but for anyone else in the world.

I would be a hypocrite if I were to oppose this.

Post-posting support: See https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/9/11/how-charlie-kirk-and-turning-point-usa-helped-trump-and-maga-win for how influential Kirk was in helping MAGA win elections.

And Melissa Hortman is not? – robertsky (talk) 09:13, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Sahaib (talk) 13:28, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
There was consensus that the combination of 1. being an assassination 2. Kirk's immense domestic political contributions repeated a dozen times here already. Anyone wanting to pull this item should address this directly beyond unsupported assertions. Aaron Liu (talk) 21:45, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Pull it right now. This wouldn't be on ITN if it were literally any other country than the USA. But unfortunately, Americans love to shove their politics down other countries' throats. Other countries exist. LilianaUwU (talk / contributions) 21:34, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
WP:ITNCDONT "Accuse other editors of supporting, opposing or nominating due to a personal bias (such as ethnocentrism)". You have accused others of pushing their politics on others, based on their nationality. But not all supporters of posting this are American, from what I can see of their bios or disclosed information. Unless you are accusing America of pushing this story onto other countries' media, like the top-of-the-page live updates on the BBC website and extended coverage on BBC TV. But it's more likely the foreign media are covering this without coercion. Other countries do exist, and they are posted, the next story on the ticker will be the ex-president of Brazil being jailed, for example.

Pull RD would suffice. Being praised as a kingmaker isn't really as notable as the king itself. Outside of America, Charlie Kirk may not be as widely covered before his death as one would think. At least in Singapore here, while he was mentioned in older articles, they were by the way kind, as comments to events happened during the election. – robertsky (talk) 01:55, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
It's of course not as notable, but still notable. I'd support posting other assassinations of kingmakers from any relatively "peaceful" country. Aaron Liu (talk) 02:02, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I am not doubting the notability of the person. I am saying that it does not rise to the level necessary for a blurb, a RD would suffice. Lee Kuan Yew credited many of his founding team as essential to his premiership, but most of them got RDs when they died because they don't matter beyond national borders (and yes the manner of their deaths aren't a violent one, this I will give). – robertsky (talk) 02:09, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

I completely disagree with that. He was barely known outside of one country. However, I'm also changing my "vote" to "support blurb" as it's clear this story has become much bigger, and is blowing up in ways I couldn't even have begun to imagine. Nfitz (talk) 01:25, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Pull. It. Right. Now. According to the other editors with whom I agree: he’s never been in office, he’s had little legacy, and hasn’t contributed significantly to political thought worldwide or even domestically. Furthermore, it’s unfair that such situations only make it to ITN if they took place in the U.S. It's high time we reassessed the criteria used to determine when a recent death gets a blurb. 207.194.85.134 (talk) 21:32, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
It is objectively untrue that domestic assassinations of political figures are never posted except for the United States. See e.g. Assassination of Miguel Uribe Turbay, Assassination of Andrei Karlov,
and Murder of David Amess, which we posted. I would not call Turbay (a Colombian Senator), Karlov (a Russian Ambassador to Turkey) or David Amess (a British backbencher), "significant contributors to worldwide political thought". And yet we posted them for the same reason we posted Kirk... because they were shot to death in a shocking manner that made worldwide headlines. It's really that simple. FlipandFlopped ㋡ 03:30, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The blurb was posted before it was established that it was an assassination attempt (ie politically motivated). And it was posted within four hours ie before most of the world could comment. Hawkeye7 (discuss) 08:22, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Regardless of motive a prominent political figure being sniped in the neck is notable enough as it would have the same effect whether or not it's an assassination. Same goes for the other killing methods listed.Most posted political blurbs are posted within four hours because this is ITN. Not to mention discussion started by 20:00 UTC, so it wasn't completely exclusionary either. Aaron Liu (talk) 19:42, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Support finally this is nominated. I'd change the blurb to a wording in which Russia is the active actor, something like "Russia launches multiple drones into NATO member Poland" or "Multiple Russian drones enter NATO member Poland and are shot down".
There are several notable factors setting this event apart from others and I think at least one or two (ideally all three) should be highlighted in the blurb: 1. that they were over a dozen drones 2. that they reached deep into Poland 3. that they were shot down. Super Ψ Dro 15:26, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Support per above, but I wonder (as has been mentioned by at least one other) if it may be a decent idea to include that Poland has invoked NATO Article 4. Maybe with that link or another one. But ultimately, it's not that common that it gets invoked - and about half of the times it's been invoked are preventative, or in other words before any actual incursion/military action against a NATO member.

Weak oppose While I see the argument that the nom is making, at the end of the day I agree a bit more with Nfitz in that it being an attack targeting Hamas (rather than Qatar and its leaders/military) puts it under the ongoing item. While the Haniyeh assassination is comparable, we posted that mainly because he of his notability as the leader of Hamas, not because Israel struck Iran.

I'm amenable to waiting for more details, but I'm in favor of posting at some point per nom. While, yes, this attack was on Hamas leadership, it was in fact on Qatar's territory and without their authorization. How exactly things play out from here is TBD, but it does risk involving Qatar proper in the larger Israel-Palestine conflict, at the very least beyond just their prior role as a mediator.

Wait/support. While we should hold off for a bit until some details are confirmed, striking Qatar in and of itself, without authorization from Qatar is enough to put this above ongoing. -- Patar knight - chat/contributions 21:41, 9 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Comment on quality There is zero need for a massive reaction section that basically just has most of the comments finger-wagging at the attack without any actual call to action or the like. That's article bloat that doesn't need to be there. Some reactions, like those actually involved here and the attempted ceasefire (Israel, Qatar, the US etc) make sense. At least some of the others, like with France, Germany and Spain, could be combined without using quotes to say other nations comdemned the attack without bullet-pointing each one. Masem (t) 05:19, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I agree. Maybe it'd be better to split that into a Reactions to article, where more countries like Kazakhstan, Mauritania, Maldives, etc., could be listed, keeping only the more pertinent ones in the parent article; or, not do that and just trim. I personally am not as hostile to the 'bullet point list with flag icons' approach as some, but indeed, it's like half the length of the article now. El_C 05:40, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

And splitting it out to a separate list article makes no sense. the section needs trimming. Reaction sections that just list statements is a lazy approach to trying to bulk up current event articles. Its the equivalent to the "thoughts and prayers" that come after a US mass shooting, statements with no actual actions behind them, despite being a reaction section. Of course the attack was criticized, so the focus should be on possible downstream impacts in the region including any threat of retaliatory action (like the disruption to the ceasefire talks). Masem (t) 12:28, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I'm sorry, but what? There was nowhere near a consensus to post this. Especially this rapidly. Consider this a PULL !vote given all the valid arguments against posting it that have been stated above. Most importantly the quality concerns as Masem noted - the current article is a massive attempt to right great wrongs as it provides undue weight to reactions, not to mention the other concerns others have had. -bɜ:ʳkənhɪmez | me | talk to me! 05:48, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Any admin should feel free to pull, I need not be consulted or even notified. But I weighed there being a WP:ROUGHCONSENSUS (as such debates often trend), though maybe a bit at the margins in this case. El_C 05:52, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I'll add some quotes of specific parts of the article that (in my view) are clearly RGW violations and any of which should have, on their own, been reason to at least temporarily withhold posting: Israel's vow; Those targeted were involved in negotiations for a ceasefire to the Gaza war - poorly sourced given current information - those targeted have not been confirmed to be a part of specific negotiations. This was too soon, at best. I am not opposed to posting in the near future, but it should not have been posted given the fact that the current article is massive NPOV/RGW violations. To be clear, @El C: I do not think you have done anything wrong - you made a determination based on the information and opinions present here. I still, however, think it's too soon to post this, and that the article needs a lot of work - to the point I think this should be pulled in the meantime. I appreciate that there is sometimes a push to post an article at ITN based on rough consensus even if it's too soon - and I don't fault you for abiding by what seems to be the norm here of post once there's a rough consensus - though I personally think that a "rough consensus" is not sufficient for something we are displaying on our main page - especially for a contentious topic.This is, as I'm sure everyone knows, a contentious topic. There's good reason it is such. And I think we would all do well to give more than ~12 hours before we post articles (about breaking news) in a CTOP to ITN. While ITN is a slight exception, we are not news. It's more important that we ensure that articles we post to the main page are, at a bare minimum, at least comprehensive and not being used as an attempt to RGW. There's at least three instances (that I identified above) that this article does not meet that criteria in my view. So it should be pulled until there is enough vision on the article to correct such attempts at RGW while it is on the main page. -bɜ:ʳkənhɪmez | me | talk to me! 05:58, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I'm wary that articles that contentious will just not get posted because by the time there's such resolution, it would no longer be a news item. Thus, a nominal state which tends to be below average is to be expected. I also don't think there should be a 12-hour (or any other) clock imposed on articles or sets of articles. But that's a substantive and well-reasoned argument for pulling, and a valid view for how ITN should operate, especially for CTOP subject matters. El_C 06:09, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Not seeing anything in favour of "those targeted have not been confirmed to be a part of specific negotiations" in the article, we have "Those targeted were involved in negotiations for a ceasefire to the Gaza war and an Israeli-Palestinian prisoner-hostage exchange. [cited to BBC] ... According to Reuters, the strike was expected to result in the temporary or permanent end of ceasefire negotiations in the war. Frank Lowenstein, the former U.S. special envoy for the Middle East, stated that the strike signified the Israeli government had not only lost interest in negotiating a ceasefire but was sufficiently confident that the negotiations would become irrelevant to proceed with assassinating the Hamas negotiating team. [cited to AP]"
Considering this was a failed assassination attempt, the only reason it is notable is due to the strong reactions and unprecedented nature of attacking Qatar. While the reactions can be trimmed, I am not seeing anything there justifying a straight up pulling. Similarly the "vow" part is not really a strong reason either, section titles can be easily changed and some may argue that it is POV from the Israeli side. Gotitbro (talk) 06:35, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I accept that maybe I'm not 100% up to date on the breaking news... but is it really a "failed assassination attempt"? I question both "failed" (i.e. did they truly fail, even if they didn't kill all targets) and "assassination attempt". To put it bluntly, targeting the military leadership of an organization you are at war with is not an "assassination attempt". It's a side effect of war. Regardless, those things being clarified (such as with further sourcing) is another reason for my argument to pull it temporarily as a too soon posting. In any case, I cannot fault the admin for posting it because I accept that my view that waiting to post to ITN/main page is better is not the overarching consensus.Regardless, I think improvements are necessary - and even since I made my original reply here, they are ongoing. That's the beauty of Wikipedia, of course. If this doesn't get pulled before it's improved to the point that pulling is unnecessary, I'm all for it - but I'll still encourage everyone to, especially in contentious topics, ask questions first and ensure that what we post on the main page is as close to perfect as possible - even if it's breaking news. In my opinion (which I appreciate may be completely against the consensus), it's better to wait even 24+ hours to post something "in the news" than to post an article sooner that is so breaking as to potentially fall victim to people using it to RGW while it's being heavily edited with breaking information. -bɜ:ʳkənhɪmez | me | talk to me! 07:16, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
"Failed": the article is currently under Category:Failed assassination attempts in Asia and considering that all of the high profile targets survived, I would say its apt and my charazterization of it followed as such. About war, see Assassination of Ismail Haniyeh (also Assassination attempts on Adolf Hitler) etc.
I can see your concerns about article quality but don' think they rise to the level of a pull, a pain to the process should only be had when the issues are very serious.
I agree about a time limit, a minimum one generally and ones for CTOPS specifically, and similar proposals have followed but I don't think this is going to gain traction among editors anytime soon. Gotitbro (talk) 16:23, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The "valid" arguments above were shortly after it occurred. It was fair enough at the time for it to be a wait. More has come out since. In addition, those reactions in the article are part of the reason why this is so noteworthy. The majority of voices were in support, for valid reasons. This feels more like a pull to bury it, rather than in good faith. Basetornado (talk) 06:12, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Comment – Is "marking the first known Israeli attack on the country" necessary for the blurb? Reads more like trivia. Nice4What (talk · contribs) – (Thanks ♥) 06:06, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
This is another reason I support pulling - until a more neutral non-RGW violating blurb can be crafted. -bɜ:ʳkənhɪmez | me | talk to me! 06:08, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
That was more to show it is notable. If it was an attack on Lebanon or Iran for example, that wouldn't be as notable, because that has occurred many times. By stating that it's the first attack on Qatar, it shows why it's so notable. Basetornado (talk) 06:13, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
There was no attack on Qatar. The attack was clearly on Hamas (which is covered in ongoing). Did Iran attack Qatar too? Nfitz (talk) 22:03, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Change to Blurb1, I think it’s redundant, I’d like to think our reader knows a little about Qatar and the conflict, and it does seem RGW. If anything, I’d support mentioning Qatar's mediating role, but probably best not to overcomplicate Kowal2701 (talk) 09:08, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I agree that the tail end of the blurb is problematic and have logged it at WP:ERRORS.
Note also that it was not a nominated blurb and so seems to be involved editorialising. Andrew🐉(talk) 09:36, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I support having "marking the first known Israeli attack on the country", and therefore support Alt Blurb. I think the significance of why this is in the news matters. This is not "editorializing", given this is an objective and indisputable fact. There are so many sources calling this either "first", "first known" or "unprecedented": NPR, Politico, Al-Jazeera, CNN, Guardian, Sky News, USA Today, [15]Vox.VR (Please ping on reply) 11:03, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Prefer blurb1 per most above if it remains up, though I still maintain my earlier oppose vote. The Kip (contribs) 12:34, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Post-posting oppose per others above. EF5 12:34, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Post-posting support – This is obviously notable, I just believe the tail end "marking the first known Israeli attack on the country" needs to be removed, as mentioned above. I've also joined in on the conversation about this in WP:ERRORS. Nice4What (talk · contribs) – (Thanks ♥) 14:52, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Post posting comment - It should say IN the country, not ON. They didnt attack Qatar. They attacked Hamas. Other than that, this is absolutely newsworthy. Metallurgist (talk) 18:28, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Post-posting support Targeting Hamas’ leaders during negotiations is notable enough for a blurb. However, the wording of the originally proposed blurb seems better to me. Blaylockjam10 (talk) 00:05, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Not ready Racing career section is largely unsourced. 5.57.243.123 (talk) 10:41, 9 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support - More sources like Economic Times, PC Gamer, and Hindustan Times have now covered her death. WP:ITNQUALITY states one or two "citation needed" tags may not hold up an article. ArtemisiaGentileschiFan (talk) 14:15, 9 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support - RIP in Peace to a Real One, Haru Urara will always be every UmaMusume trainer's daughter. I see two citation needed tags though. --GhostStalker (Got a present for ya! / Mission Log) 14:45, 9 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose on quality. Could use some extra citations in the career section, though, granted, I wouldn't say the minutiae of her career was the real story of her life, so perhaps some of that could be cut down. RIP to a legend. DarkSide830 (talk) 15:16, 9 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Not ready - quite a few CN tags.
Support - issues addressed.
