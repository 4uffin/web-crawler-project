Charles James Kirk (October 14, 1993 – September 10, 2025) was an American right-wing political activist, author, and media personality. He was executive director of the student organization Turning Point USA (TPUSA), which he co-founded in 2012 to promote conservative beliefs in high schools and on college campuses. He published a range of books and hosted The Charlie Kirk Show, a conservative talk radio program. In his later years, he became recognized as one of the most prominent voices of the populist MAGA movement in the Republican Party.
Kirk was born and raised in the Chicago suburbs of Arlington Heights and Prospect Heights, briefly attending Harper College before dropping out after one semester to pursue political activism full-time. He worked with various donors to fund TPUSA, rising to prominence via college campus debates held at his signature Prove Me Wrong table. He has since been credited with generating interest in political conservatism amongst the youth.[1][2][3] He extended TPUSA's influence through the Professor Watchlist and School Board Watchlist, founded to spread conservative ideals at liberal-leaning colleges. Under his leadership, TPUSA developed several affiliate groups, including Turning Point Action and Turning Point Faith, with the latter aimed at mobilizing religious communities around conservative issues. Initially critical of the evangelical right, he shifted to Christian nationalism, advocating a Christian form of government and a Christian population. On other religions, he argued that non-Christian Indians are unaligned with American national identity and that Jewish communities have been pushing hatred against Whites. He voiced a belief in the decline and victimhood of White Americans and that a pilot is not presumed qualified if he's Black. Leading Turning Point Action, he sent buses of students to the rally that led to the January 6 United States Capitol attack, for which he pled the Fifth before the January 6th Committee.
A key ally of Donald Trump, he promoted far-right and Trump-aligned causes and espoused a variety of conservative stances, including opposition to abortion, gun control, and LGBT rights. His more controversial views included his criticism of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Martin Luther King Jr., his promotion of COVID-19 misinformation and false claims of electoral fraud in 2020, and opposition to mass Muslim immigration.
On September 10, 2025, Kirk was shot and killed while speaking at a TPUSA public debate event on the Utah Valley University campus. His death gained international attention and led to the condemnation of political violence by prominent domestic and international figures. President Trump announced that Kirk would posthumously receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
Early life and education
Charles James Kirk was born on October 14, 1993, in the Chicago suburb of Arlington Heights, Illinois,[4] and raised in nearby Prospect Heights. His father Robert W. Kirk is an architect who was involved in the construction of Trump Tower.[5] His mother Kimberly is a former trader at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange who subsequently worked as a mental health counselor.[6][5][7] Kirk later described his parents as moderate Republicans,[7] and his father donated to Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign.[4] Raised in the Presbyterian Church, Kirk was a member of the Boy Scouts of America and earned the rank of Eagle Scout.[8][9] During his time in middle school, he read books by economist Milton Friedman, to which he attributed his political awakening.[7]
In 2010, during his junior year at Wheeling High School, Kirk volunteered for the successful U.S. Senate campaign of Illinois Republican Mark Kirk (no relation).[10] In his senior year, he created a campaign to reverse a price increase for cookies at his school.[7] He wrote an essay for Breitbart News alleging liberal bias in high-school textbooks, which led to his first media appearance on Fox Business at age 17.[11] He applied to the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York, but was rejected in 2012.[11] He attended Harper College near Chicago, but dropped out after one semester.[11][4]
At a speaking engagement at Benedictine University's "Youth Empowerment Day", Kirk met Bill Montgomery, a retiree more than 50 years his senior, who was then a Tea Party–backed legislative candidate.[12][13] Montgomery encouraged Kirk to engage in political activism full-time.[4] Montgomery and Kirk subsequently co-founded Turning Point USA, a "grass-roots organization to rival liberal groups such as MoveOn.org".[14] At the 2012 Republican National Convention, Kirk met Foster Friess, a prominent Republican donor, and persuaded him to finance the organization.[12][14]
Organizations
Turning Point USA
Main article: Turning Point USA
Kirk at the Conservative Political Action Conference in 2014Kirk was CEO, chief fundraiser, and the public face of Turning Point USA from its founding to his death in 2025.[15][9] He co-founded the organization in 2012, when he was 18.[16] According to The New York Times, he turned the organization into a "well-funded media operation, backed by conservative megadonors like the Wyoming businessman Foster Friess".[17] TPUSA's activities include publication of the Professor Watchlist and the School Board Watchlist.[18] Critics of these watchlists say they threaten academic freedom and have led to the targeted harassment of academics.[19][20] In 2019, the Professor Watchlist was briefly suspended by its web host.[21] For years Turning Point held conservative mass rallies drawing tens of thousands of young voters.[22]
In 2020, ProPublica investigated TPUSA's finances and found that the organization made "misleading financial claims", that the audits were not done by an independent auditor, and that the leaders had enriched themselves while advocating for Trump. ProPublica also reported that Kirk's salary from TPUSA had increased from $27,000 to nearly $300,000 and that he had bought an $855,000 condo in Longboat Key, Florida.[23] In 2020, Turning Point USA had $39.2 million in revenue.[24] Kirk earned a salary of more than $325,000 from TPUSA and related organizations.[25]

In 2021, TPUSA announced an online academy targeting students in schools "poisoning our youth with anti-American ideas". Turning Point Academy was intended to cater to families seeking an "America-first education". Arizona education firm StrongMind initially partnered with TPUSA with plans to open the academy by the fall of 2022 and assessed its "potential to generate over $40 million in gross revenue at full capacity (10,000 students)". The partnership ended after StrongMind received backlash from its own employees, and key subcontractor Freedom Learning Group, which prepared course content for the academy, also backed out.[26]
Turning Point Action
Main article: Turning Point Action
Kirk and President Donald Trump speaking with attendees at a Turning Point Action Conference in 2023In May 2019, it was reported that Kirk was preparing to launch Turning Point Action, a 501(c)(4) entity designed to target Democrats.[27] In July 2019, Kirk announced that Turning Point Action had acquired Students for Trump along with "all associated media assets".[28] He became chairman and launched a campaign to recruit one million students for the 2020 Trump reelection campaign.[29] The unsuccessful effort led TPUSA and the Trump campaign to blame each other for an overall decline in Trump's youth support.[30] In December 2022, Kirk announced the Mount Vernon Project, an initiative by Turning Point Action to remove members from the Republican National Committee who were not "grassroot conservatives".[31]
Kirk and Candace Owens speaking at the Student Action Summit hosted by Turning Point USA, West Palm Beach, Florida, December 2018On January 5, 2021, the day before the Washington, D.C., protest that led to the January 6 United States Capitol attack, Kirk wrote on Twitter that Turning Point Action and Students for Trump were sending more than 80 "buses of patriots to D.C. to fight for this president".[32][33][34] A spokesman for Turning Point said that the groups ended up sending seven buses, not 80, with 350 students.[32][35] In the lead-up to the storming, Kirk said he was "getting 500 emails a minute calling for a civil war".[36] Publix heiress Julie Fancelli gave Kirk's organizations $1.25 million to fund the buses to the January 6 event. Kirk also paid $60,000 for Kimberly Guilfoyle to speak at the rally.[37]
Afterward, Kirk said the violent acts at the Capitol were not an insurrection and did not represent mainstream Trump supporters.[38][better source needed][39][better source needed] Appearing before the United States House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack in December 2022, he pleaded the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. His team provided the committee "with 8,000 pages of records in response to its requests".[40] In another closed-door meeting of the House January 6 Committee, Ali Alexander blamed Kirk and TPUSA for financing the travel of demonstrators to the Stop the Steal rally.[41] TPUSA spokesperson Andrew Kolvet denied that Kirk advocated for violence and gave a statement saying "Charlie wants to save America with words, persuasion, courage and common sense. The left is desperate to conjure up some Christian bogeyman that simply doesn't exist. We're telling churches: Either get involved and have a say in the direction of your country or you'll leave a void that someone else who doesn't share your values will fill."[42]
Falkirk Center for Faith and Liberty
In November 2019, Kirk and Jerry Falwell Jr. co-founded the "Falkirk Center for Faith and Liberty", a right-wing think tank funded, owned, and housed by Liberty University.[43][44] "Falkirk" was a portmanteau of "Falwell" and "Kirk".[44] Fellows included Antonia Okafor, director of outreach for Gun Owners of America; Sebastian Gorka, former deputy assistant to Trump; and Jenna Ellis, a senior legal counselor for Trump.[45] In 2020, the Falkirk Center spent at least $50,000 on Facebook advertisements promoting Trump and Republican candidates.[46] Students and alumni raised objections to the organization's aggressive political tone, which they considered inconsistent with the university's mission.[44] Falwell resigned as president of Liberty University in August 2020, and the university did not renew Kirk's one-year contract in late 2020. In 2021, the university renamed the organization "Standing for Freedom Center".[44]
Turning Point Faith
After Liberty University did not renew Kirk's contract with the Falkirk Center for Faith and Liberty in 2021, Kirk and Pentecostal pastor Rob McCoy founded Turning Point Faith, an organization that encouraged pastors and other church leaders to be active in local and national political issues.[44][47] Its activities include faith-based voter drives and inculcating "TPUSA's core values".[48][better source needed] According to TPUSA's 2021 Investor Prospectus, the program—with a budget of $6.4 million—"will 'address America's crumbling religious foundation by engaging thousands of pastors nationwide' in order to 'breathe renewed civic engagement into our churches'".[49]
Media

From October 2020 until his death, Kirk hosted a daily three-hour radio talk show, The Charlie Kirk Show, on Salem Media Group's "The Answer" radio channel.[50][51] According to internal data from TPUSA, Kirk's podcast was downloaded between 500,000 and 750,000 times each day in 2024.[52] As of December 7, 2021, The Charlie Kirk Show was the 21st-most-popular podcast on Apple Podcasts.[53] Kirk's "Turning Point Live" was a three-hour streaming talk show aimed at Generation Z. TPUSA's monthly online average grew to 111,000 unique visitors in 2021.[54] A February 2023 Brookings Institution study found Kirk's podcast contained the second-highest proportion of false, misleading, and unsubstantiated statements among 36,603 episodes produced by 79 prominent political podcasters.[55]
In a 2022 episode of his podcast, Kirk called for a "patriot" to bail out of jail the man who broke into Nancy Pelosi's house and attacked and tried to murder her husband with a hammer.[56][57] Also in 2022, journalist Bari Weiss released a report of internal Twitter documents dubbed "The Twitter Files", which alleged that Twitter was censoring conservative personalities on the social media platform. Weiss posted screenshots of Twitter tools that moderators could use to limit the reach of posts and accounts. According to Rolling Stone magazine, Kirk's Twitter account was flagged under "do not amplify", which meant algorithms would not highlight tweets coming from it.[58][59]
In April 2024, Kirk created a TikTok account after previously expressing skepticism of the social media platform. His account gained popularity after he posted numerous videos of himself talking to college students on his campus tours, with some videos garnering as many as 50 million views.[60] In February 2025, Kirk signed with Trinity Broadcasting Network to host a weekday talk show, Charlie Kirk Today.[61]
Books
Kirk co-wrote, with Brent Hamachek, the 2016 book Time for a Turning Point: Setting a Course Toward Free Markets and Limited Government for Future Generations (Simon & Schuster).[62][page needed] Kirk wrote the 2018 book Campus Battlefield: How Conservatives Can WIN the Battle on Campus and Why It Matters. Donald Trump Jr. wrote its foreword.[63][better source needed] In a review for The Weekly Standard, Adam Rubenstein called the book a "hot mess", "nothing more than a marketing pitch for [Turning Point USA]", and "stuffed with reprintings of his tweets and quotes from others".[64] Other books include The MAGA Doctrine: The Only Ideas That Will Win the Future (2020),[65][66] The College Scam: How America's Universities Are Bankrupting and Brainwashing Away the Future of America's Youth (2022),[67] and Right Wing Revolution: How to Beat the Woke and Save the West (2024).[68][page needed]

Kirk's outspoken political activism received criticism and controversy. The New York Times said Kirk symbolized hope for the Christian right.[69] His rhetoric was described as divisive, racist, xenophobic, and extreme by groups that studied hate speech, including the Southern Poverty Law Center. Kirk disagreed with critics that he created a toxic environment online, arguing that "Disagreement is a healthy part of our systems".[70]
Kirk was the William F. Buckley Jr. Council Member of the Council for National Policy (CNP), a group "that has served for decades as a hub for a nationwide network of conservative activists and the donors who support them",[71] according to the CNP's September 2020 membership directory leaked in February 2021.[72][73][74] He was a spokesperson for CNP Action, the political arm of the CNP.[73][75] In March 2025, Donald Trump appointed Kirk to the United States Air Force Academy Board of Visitors.[76][77] Kirk's last political rally took place in Kentucky, where he appeared alongside Senate candidate Nate Morris.[78][79]

Republican and pro-Trump activism
Kirk with Donald Trump at a rally in 2021
In an interview with Wired magazine during the 2016 Republican National Convention, he said that while he "was not the world's biggest Donald Trump fan", he would vote for him, and that Trump's candidacy made Turning Point's mission more difficult.[80] Kirk flipped to supporting Trump at the convention and spent the remainder of the campaign assisting with travel and media arrangements for Donald Trump Jr.[81] In October 2016, Kirk participated in a Fox News event along with Trump Jr., Eric Trump, and Lara Trump that had a pro-Donald Trump tone.[82]
In July 2019, Kirk became chairman of Students for Trump, which had been acquired by Turning Point Action, and launched a campaign to recruit a million students for the 2020 Trump reelection campaign.[29] The unsuccessful effort led TPUSA and the Trump campaign to blame each other for an overall decline in Trump's youth support.[30] In April 2020, Matthew Rosenberg and Katie Rogers wrote in The New York Times that Kirk "[walks] the line between mainstream conservative opinion and outright disinformation" and that "with a powerful ally in the president's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., Mr. Kirk both amplifies the president's message and helps shape it."[81]
On March 3, 2020, Kirk released his book The MAGA Doctrine, a manifesto for the Make America Great Again movement, in which he wrote that the Republican Party is "in some sense no longer a conservative party, no longer the party of Reagan, but instead a Trump-remade populist party".[83] At an August 2020 meeting of the Council for National Policy, Kirk said: "Democrats have done a really foolish thing by shutting down all these campuses ... It's gonna remove ballot harvesting opportunities and all their voter fraud that they usually do on college campuses—so they're actually removing half a million votes off the table. So please keep the campuses closed—it's a great thing. Whatever!"[71] In December 2022, Kirk urged the Republican National Committee to listen to their grassroots voters, saying, "If ignored, we will have the most stunted and muted Republican Party in the history of the conservative movement, the likes of which we haven't seen in generations."[31] In 2023, Kirk called for the imprisonment or the death penalty of Joe Biden for "crimes against America".[84]
Kirk and Senator Rand Paul in Palm Beach, Florida, December 18, 2019
Kirk was an early investor in 1789 Capital, which invests in MAGA businesses. Trump Jr. joined 1789 Capital in November 2024, after Trump won the 2024 election.[85][86] Before the 2024 U.S. presidential election, Kirk visited approximately 25 college campuses, marketed as the "You're Being Brainwashed" tour. His aim was to stir up more Gen Z voter turnout, and he engaged and debated students on many topics. According to Turning Point Action, the tour produced around two billion views on social media.[87] The tour has been praised as having a "critical role" in Trump's election.[88] Kirk aided the president-elect in choosing leadership positions for his administration, including cabinet positions.[89] On July 15, 2025, Kirk conducted extensive interviews about Jeffrey Epstein on his podcast and pressured Trump's administration to release more information.[90] By then, Kirk was one of the most prominent figures in the MAGA movement and often called the face of the movement.[91][90][92]
False claims and conspiracy theories
External videos Charlie Kirk ~ The Conservative Forum ~ 9-8-2015 on YouTube (Liberty Forum of Silicon Valley) (at 2:10–3:20)
According to Forbes, Kirk was known for "his repudiation of liberal college education and embrace of pro-Trump conspiracy theories".[93] He promoted the Cultural Marxism conspiracy theory[94][95][96] and called universities "islands of totalitarianism".[9] In a 2015 speech at the Liberty Forum of Silicon Valley, Kirk said he had applied for nomination to the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York, and was not accepted.[15] He said that "the slot he considered his went to 'a far less-qualified candidate of a different gender and a different persuasion'" whose test scores he claimed he knew.[9] He told The New Yorker in 2017 that he was being sarcastic when he said it.[9] He told the Chicago Tribune in 2018 that "he was just repeating something he'd been told",[7][97] while at a New Hampshire Turning Point event featuring Rand Paul in October 2019 he claimed he never said it.[97]
Kirk promoted debunked claims about George Floyd, such as that he was "illegally counterfeiting currency" and had once "put a gun to a pregnant woman's stomach".[98] On Facebook, YouTube, and Rumble, Kirk repeatedly promoted the false claim that the medical examiner who performed the autopsy declared Floyd had died of an overdose. After a fact check by AFP that noted the doctor stood by the classification of Floyd's death as a homicide, corrections were added to Kirk's posts on social media.[99]
In July 2018, Kirk falsely claimed on social media that U.S. Justice Department statistics showed an increase in human trafficking arrests from 1,952 in the year 2016 to 6,087 in the first half of 2018. He deleted the tweet without explanation the next day, after a fact-checker had pointed out that the false 2018 number had originated on the conspiracy site 8chan.[100][101] In December 2018, Kirk falsely claimed that protesters in the French yellow vests movement chanted "We want Trump". These false claims were later repeated by Trump.[102]
Ahead of the 2020 U.S. presidential election, Kirk spread falsehoods about voter fraud,[103][104] and immediately after Trump lost the 2020 election, Kirk promoted false and disproven claims of fraud in the election.[105][106] On November 5, 2020, he led a Stop the Steal protest at the Maricopa Tabulation Center in Phoenix.[107] Kirk was considered a "big name" social influencer in Rudy Giuliani's communications plan to overturn the 2020 election.[108] In August 2025, Kirk called for the elimination of Jasmine Crockett's congressional district as a part of the 2025 Texas redistricting, justifying the erasure of her district by claiming she was a part of an "attempt to eliminate the white population in this country".[109]
COVID-19 misinformation

In 2020, Kirk spread false information and conspiracy theories about COVID-19 on social media platforms, such as Twitter. He sharply criticized Democrats' criticism of Trump's withdrawal of WHO funding and called COVID-19 the "China virus", which Trump retweeted.[81] Kirk alleged that the WHO covered up information about the COVID-19 pandemic. He was briefly banned from Twitter after falsely claiming that hydroxychloroquine had proved to be "100% effective in treating the virus";[81] he alleged that Gretchen Whitmer, the Democratic governor of Michigan, threatened doctors who tried to use the medication.[81] These falsehoods were retweeted by Rudy Giuliani, whose account was then also suspended.[81][110]
In defending the Trump administration's response to the pandemic, Kirk falsely stated that during the 2009 swine flu pandemic it "took President Barack Obama 'millions infected and over 1,000 deaths'" to declare a public health emergency.[111][112] In fact, when the Obama administration acknowledged the WHO's declaration of a public health emergency on April 26, 2009,[113] there were less than 280 cases of H1N1 infection reported in the U.S.,[114] and the first confirmed death (of a Mexican toddler on vacation) occurred the next day, April 27.[115] The WHO projected 1,000,000+ U.S. cases on June 25, after declaring a pandemic on June 11.[116]
Kirk called the public health measure of social distancing prohibitions in churches a "Democratic plot against Christianity" and made the unfounded assertion that authorities in Wuhan, China, were burning patients.[81] In 2020, he said he refused to abide by mask requirements because "the science around masks is very questionable."[93][117] In July 2021, Kirk promoted misleading claims about the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccines.[25] On Fox News' Tucker Carlson show, Kirk called mandatory requirements for students to take the COVID-19 vaccine "medical apartheid".[118] He called for parents to protest at school board meetings, urging them to push back against mask-wearing.[119]

At first, Kirk was critical of the evangelical right, but he came to reverse his position. In 2018, he told Dave Rubin, "We do have a separation of church and state, and we should support that."[42] But in 2019 Kirk met Rob McCoy, a pastor of a megachurch in Ventura County, California, who convinced him that America's founding documents were derived from the Bible.[42] In 2021 Kirk told a congregation, "The Bible says very clearly to 'Occupy until I come'", a verse often cited by followers of the Seven Mountain Mandate to assert that before Jesus returns evangelical Christians must dominate seven areas of society: government, media, education, business, family, religion, and entertainment. Kirk later interviewed with the creator of the Seven Mountain concept.[42][120][121][122] In 2022, Kirk called the separation of Church and state in the United States a "fabrication".[42] In 2024, he said, "One of the reasons we're living through a constitutional crisis is that we no longer have a Christian nation, but we have a Christian form of government, and they're incompatible. You cannot have liberty if you do not have a Christian population."[123] Appearing at a Trump campaign rally in the same year, he said: "This is a Christian state. I'd like to see it stay that way."[91] By 2024 Kirk's shift to Christian nationalism exemplified its growing approval by the Republican Party under Trump.[124][42][122][125]
Kirk believed in the superiority of the Western world, to which he credits the role of Christianity in civilization for. In a 2023 speech, he said that "all men are created equal in the eyes of God, all men and women, but not all cultures are created equal. To say that, you get attacked in every direction, but excuse me when I say that Western civilization is the best that humanity has produced. It's an outgrowth of the Bible."[126]
LGBTQ issues
According to a 2024 NBC News report, Kirk was relatively secular liberal regarding LGBTQ rights in the United States in 2018, but shifted toward more religious conservative stances.[42] On January 21, 2025, Kirk praised Trump for revoking Executive Order 14004, which had allowed transgender people to serve openly in the military, and said, "Sorry, if you're Jeff and you think you're Jill, you are not going to serve in the U.S. military. Go find something else to do."[127] On March 19, 2025, when U.S. District Judge Ana C. Reyes issued an injunction blocking the ban, Kirk denounced the decision, saying: "Now, a district court judge ordering the U.S. military to continue enlisting mentally delusional transgender troops is justifying her ruling by quoting the musical Hamilton."[128]
On June 11, 2019, after the Letsweletse Motshidiemang v. Attorney General ruling in Botswana that struck down colonial-era sodomy provisions, Kirk credited the country's decriminalization of homosexuality to Trump's "global push to decriminalize homosexuality". He framed the ruling as evidence of Trump's international influence on LGBTQ rights and asked whether major U.S. media outlets such as CNN and MSNBC would give the administration credit for what he called a "monumental achievement".[129] The phrase referred to a campaign announced in February 2019 by the Trump administration, led by U.S. Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell, to encourage countries to repeal laws criminalizing same-sex relations.[130]
On November 22, 2019, Kirk said "I believe marriage is one man, one woman", but added that gay people should be allowed in the conservative movement.[131][132] In 2022, during an episode of The Charlie Kirk Show streamed on YouTube, Kirk criticized the Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell v. Hodges. He called LGBTQ activists the "alphabet mafia", claiming that the movement is not "just about two dudes being able to get married". Kirk called Obergefell a "national takeover of our laws" and argued that conservatives mistakenly thought the issue of same-sex marriage would end after the ruling, instead concluding that "they are not happy just having marriage" and "want to corrupt your children".[133]
On October 14, 2021, Kirk said "the facts are that there are only two genders; that transgenderism and gender 'fluidity' are lies that hurt people and abuse kids."[134] In early 2023, he said that transgender women in women's locker rooms should be "taken care of the way we used to take care of things in the 1950s and '60s".[135] On April 1, 2024, Kirk called for Trump to propose a nationwide ban of gender-affirming care for transgender people.[136] The same day, he called for the imprisonment of doctors who perform gender-affirming care and demanded "Nuremberg-style" trials for them.[137]
In mid-2024, Kirk asserted there is an "LGBTQ agenda".[42] On September 26, he responded to a student who identified himself as a gay conservative. Kirk welcomed the student "to the conservative movement" but also said that, from a Christian perspective, he did "not agree with that lifestyle". He added that sexual orientation should not be the primary basis of identity, saying, "I don't think you should introduce yourself just based on your sexual attraction." Despite his personal opposition, he emphasized that shared political values such as "strong borders" and "a strong country" were more important for inclusion in conservatism.[138][better source needed] On June 8, 2024, he criticized YouTuber Ms. Rachel for a post celebrating Pride Month.[125] In the same podcast episode, Kirk called being gay an "error" and likened the LGBTQ pride movement to encouraging drug addicts.[139]
Abortion
Kirk strongly opposed abortion. In a September 2024 debate hosted by Jubilee Media, Kirk argued that abortion is murder and should be illegal. He opposed exceptions for rape, including for children as young as 10.[140] Kirk compared abortion to the Holocaust, and said that abortion is worse.[141]
Gun rights and the Second Amendment
Kirk was a gun owner and gun rights advocate. He was opposed to gun control.[142] After the Parkland school shooting in February 2018, he spoke for the National Rifle Association in Parkland, Florida.[143][144] Kirk was invited by a student to a pro-gun event in the school where the shooting happened, but the event was canceled. He had said that guns, armed guards, and gun detectors could be used to prevent shootings in schools and campuses.[145][146] In an April 2023 TPUSA event in Salt Lake City, Utah, Kirk said: "I think it's worth it, I think it's worth to have a cost of, unfortunately, some gun deaths every single year so that we can have the Second Amendment to protect our other God-given rights."[147][148][149][150]
Relationships and "sexual anarchy"
In October 2021, Kirk said on his podcast that Democrats wanted Americans to live where "there is no cultural identity, where you live in sexual anarchy, where private property is a thing of the past, and the ruling class controls everything." Following social media backlash, he released a statement on the website of the Claremont Institute doubling down on and expanding his remarks.[151][152][134] According to Media Matters for America, at the TPUSA Young Women's Leadership Summit 2022 Conference, Kirk said that the "biblical model" for women to pursue in romantic relationships is a partner who is "a protector and a leader, and deep down, a vast majority of you agree" and that "if you want to go meet conservative men that have their act together, that aren't like, woke beta men, like, start a Turning Point USA chapter, you'll meet a lot of them."[153] Kirk stated that birth control makes women angry and bitter, which he alleged suited the political leanings of the Democratic Party. He also believed the medication "screws up female brains".[154]
Race
White Americans
Kirk had voiced a belief in the decline and victimhood of White Americans. In 2015 Kirk said that his dream in life to attend West Point was lost to a candidate of a different ethnicity. The rejection, which he blamed on affirmative action, deepened his turn to the right wing.[9][15][11] In 2018 Kirk told a college audience that the concept of white privilege is a myth and a "racist idea".[15][155][156] Assuming "more hard-right positions", he told followers of his radio podcast in 2021 that Democratic immigration policies were aimed at "diminishing and decreasing white demographics in America" and called for Texas to "deputize a citizen force and put them on the border" to protect "white demographics in America."[74][157][158] In 2023, he said, "prowling Blacks go around for fun to go target white people" in urban America.[159] In 2024, Kirk said, "The great replacement strategy, which is well under way every single day in our southern border, is a strategy to replace white rural America with something different,"[159] and added, "The American Democrat party hates this country. They wanna see it collapse. They love it when America becomes less white."[159] Also that year Kirk posted, "The 'Great Replacement' is not a theory, it's a reality", alongside a Fox News headline that read, "7.2M illegals entered the U.S. under Biden admin[istration], an amount greater than population of 36 states."[160]
Kirk with Ben Carson in June 2024
African Americans
In 2016, Kirk said about TPUSA's national director Crystal Clanton, "Turning Point needs more Crystals; so does America." In 2017, it was revealed that Crystal Clanton allegedly sent a text message in the past that read, "i hate black people. Like f— them all... I hate blacks. End of story." Kirk responded by having Clanton expelled from the organization.[161][162]
In 2018, Kirk cited single motherhood in Chicago's Black community as a cause of gun violence, blaming the absence of a father from some Black households on "a broken culture problem".[163][164] Kirk praised Martin Luther King Jr. prior to December 2023, variously calling him a "hero" and a "civil rights icon". That December, he used a speech at AmericaFest to describe him as "awful ... not a good person" and as someone who is admired only because he said "one thing he didn't actually believe". The speech also saw Kirk condemn the Civil Rights Act of 1964, calling its passage a "huge mistake" and alleging that it had created a "permanent DEI-type bureaucracy".[165] Kirk called the legal apparatus of the Civil Rights Act an "anti-white weapon".[166] Kirk told The New York Times, "I take the Caldwellian view, from his book The Age of Entitlement, that we went through a new founding in the '60s and that the Civil Rights Act has actually superseded the U.S. Constitution as its reference point. In fact, I bet if you polled Americans, most of them would have more reverence for the Civil Rights Act than the Constitution. I could be wrong, but I think I'm right."[60]
In a November 2021 Fox News article, Kirk wrote that he believed state power should be used to stop teachers from instructing children on critical race theory, and that to "directly confronting the left, and promising to fight their illiberal ideology with state power when necessary, is the key to winning everyday Americans."[167][165] Kirk served on Donald Trump's 1776 Commission, a response to the 1619 Project.[168] In October 2021, Kirk began the "Exposing Critical Racism Tour" of a number of campuses and off-campus venues to "fight racist theories on America's college campuses!"[169][170]
In January 2024, Kirk said that a "myth" had been created around King which had "grown totally out of control" and that King was currently "the most honored, worshiped, even deified person of the 20th century" despite "most people" supposedly disliking him during his life. Responding to accusations by Malcolm Kenyatta that he was working to undermine King and the Voting Rights Act, Kirk called this claim "a lie" and "fear-mongering", and added that telling the "truth" about King "should not be trampling sacred ground" since he was "just a man ... a very flawed one at that" and a "mythological anti-racist creation of the 1960s". Kirk later said he had "found the sacred cow of modern America" in criticizing King.[171]
Also in January 2024, Kirk blamed DEI programs for national aviation issues, saying, "If I see a Black pilot, I'm going to be like, 'Boy, I hope he's qualified.'"[172][173][174] He had previously expressed opposition to DEI programs, describing them as "anti-White".[175][better source needed] NBC News further reported that Kirk's comments about DEI programs and his comment about Black or African American airline pilots resulted in ongoing conflict with the Republican National Committee over outreach to Black voters.[52] Kirk called Ketanji Brown Jackson a "recipient of Affirmative Action" and said she was nominated for the Supreme Court because of her race.[176] Kirk blamed the high death toll of the July 2025 Central Texas floods on DEI.[177] On September 9, 2025, while speaking about the killing of Iryna Zarutska, an unprovoked killing of a Ukrainian refugee woman in Charlotte, North Carolina, Kirk accused Democrats of spreading a "false narrative" that "that there is a relentless assault against Black people on behalf of white people",[178] saying "White individuals are actually more likely to be attacked, especially even per capita, by Black individuals in this country."[92]
Indians
Charlie Kirk has been vocal about his disapproval of immigration of Indians, particularly non-Christian Indian Americans, into the US. These positions stem from views on economic competition and religious pluralism. On the topic of the former, Kirk stated that "America does not need more visas for people from India", arguing that the American workforce has become dominated by Indian-American immigrants effectively decreasing job opportunities for Americans.[179] On the topic of the latter, Kirk has commented on how non-Christian Indians are unaligned with American national identity, stating that America would still be America if it were 90% Indian, as long as the Indians were Christian.[180] India, which has a predominantly Hindu population, is comprised of a religious demographic wherein more than 80% practice various Dharmic religions, which are diametrically opposed to the Abrahamic religion, Christianity, that Kirk favors.[181][182]
American Jews and antisemitism
Kirk had been accused of antisemitism by multiple people and organizations;[183][184][185] The Anti-Defamation League accused Kirk of creating a "vast platform for extremists and far-right conspiracy theorists".[183] In October 2023, he said on The Charlie Kirk Show that "Jewish donors have been the Number 1 funding mechanism of radical, open border, neoliberal, quasi‑Marxist policies ... This is a beast created by secular Jews, and now it's coming for Jews". He also suggested that these Jews control "not just the colleges; it's the nonprofits, it's the movies, it's Hollywood, it's all of it". Soon after, he said that "Jews have been some of the largest funders of cultural Marxist ideas and supporters of those ideas over the last 30 or 40 years."[186] Kirk called on American Jews to stop "subsidizing your own demise by supporting institutions that breed Anti-Semites and endorse genocidal killers".[183]
In November 2023, Kirk said that "Jewish communities have been pushing the exact kind of hatred against whites that they claim to want people to stop using against them".[184] He went on to claim "the philosophical foundation of anti-whiteness has been largely financed by Jewish donors", but said he was glad that some donors were reconsidering.[187] In 2025, Kirk said that "No non-Jewish person my age has a longer or clearer record of support for Israel, sympathy with the Jewish people, or opposition to antisemitism than I do".[183] In July 2025, Kirk warned his followers against hatred of Jews, calling it "evil" and "demonic".[188] Some Jewish public figures have defended Kirk against accusations of antisemitism, citing his pro-Israel stance. Kirk was funded by some Jewish donors, including Bernie Marcus.[189]
Islam
In 2025, he wrote that "Islam is the sword the left is using to slit the throat of America."[190] Following the victory of Zohran Mamdani in the 2025 New York City Democratic mayoral primary, Kirk posted that "24 years ago a group of Muslims killed 2,753 people on 9/11. Now a Muslim Socialist is on pace to run New York City." Liberal Fox News commentator Jessica Tarlov asked Kirk to take down the "gross and Islamophobic" post.[191] In a separate post, Kirk argued that "It's not Islamophobia to notice that Muslims want to import values into the West that seek to destabilize our civilization."[192] Earlier in 2018, Kirk spoke at the annual conference of anti-Muslim group ACT for America, an organization with multiple ties to Turning Point USA.[193]
Immigration and deportation
At a 2023 event at Missouri State University, Kirk said that immigration to the United States should be completely stopped.[126] In the lead-up to the 2024 presidential election, Kirk promoted the false claim that Haitians in Springfield, Ohio, were eating residents' pets and other wildlife.[194][195] Kirk called for the use of force against migrants at the U.S.–Mexico border, including the use of tear gas, rubber bullets and whips. Kirk said that migrants were "bringing force upon themselves" by "invading" the country. In justifying this use of force, Kirk promoted false claims of disproportionate criminality among migrants, saying: "Those are the men that will go into your communities and break into your homes and rape your women, take your children. But, hey, they're -- they're dreamers."[196]
In 2023, Kirk called for Mehdi Hasan to be deported and deplatformed over his views on the COVID-19 pandemic, calling him a "neurotic lunatic" and saying "Send him back to the country he came from. Holy cow! Get him off TV. Revoke his visa."[197] In October 2023, Kirk also called U.S. Representative Ilhan Omar a "terrorist sympathizer" and called for her deportation.[126]
Opioid epidemic
Kirk blamed the Chinese Communist government and drug cartels for the opioid crisis in the United States, telling the audience that "almost nobody in this audience has a friend that you've lost to the Russian government but you do have a friend or a family member that has died because of the cartels and the Chinese Communist Party with a fentanyl coming into our communities".[198]
Kirk with Alex Marlow and Nigel Farage in December 2018
Foreign affairs
Israel and Palestine
Kirk was highly supportive of Israel.[199] During a 2019 visit to Jerusalem, he told an audience "I'm very pro-Israel ... and my whole life I have defended Israel".[183] In August 2025, he said "I have a bulletproof resumé showing my defense of Israel ... I believe in the scriptural land rights given to Israel. I believe in fulfilment of prophecy", and added that he would "fight for" Israel.[200] Kirk often repeated pro-Israeli talking points about the Gaza war and Gaza genocide.[200] He blamed Hamas for the deaths of civilians in Gaza,[200] and denied that Israel is starving Palestinians.[183] Kirk did not recognize the State of Palestine.[201]
He backed Republican crackdowns on the 2024 pro-Palestinian protests on university campuses, and activist deportations in the second Trump presidency.[183][190] Kirk opposed crackdowns on pro-Palestinian speech if they were targeted at US citizens. He said that "We've allowed far too many people who hate America move here from abroad, but the right to speak freely is the birthright of all Americans."[190] In April 2025, he expressed concerns that the Trump administration's crackdowns on campuses threatened free speech and were a weaponization of antisemitism, saying: "Once 'antisemitism' becomes valid grounds to censor or even imprison somebody, there will be frantic efforts to label all kinds of speech as antisemitic — the same way the left labeled all kinds of statements as 'racist' to justify silencing their opposition."[183] In May 2025, Kirk opposed a bipartisan bill to expand anti-BDS laws, which punish the boycott of Israel.[202] He said the bill would "only create more antisemitism, and play into growing narratives that Israel is running the U.S. government".[203] Kirk opposed U.S. involvement in the Iran–Israel War.[204]
Although Kirk was a staunch defender of Israel, he also shared some critical views of the Israeli government. Shortly after the October 7 attacks on Israel in 2023, Kirk had promoted a conspiracy theory alleging the Israeli government knew that Hamas was going to launch the attack, and that Netanyahu allowed it to go ahead as part of a plan to remain in power.[205] Shortly before Kirk's death, he suggested that Jeffrey Epstein had been an Israeli intelligence agent.[200]
Several Israeli government ministers, politicians and political activists mourned Kirk's death, with many describing him as a "friend of Israel" and a few linking his killing to anti-Zionists.[185] Netanyahu said he had recently invited Kirk to Israel, while Morton Klein said Kirk had recently accepted an invitation to speak at the Zionist Organization of America's national gala.[183]
Russian invasion of Ukraine
Kirk often advanced pro-Russian talking points about the Russo-Ukrainian War.[206] In the days before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Kirk characterized the tensions as a "border dispute" and repeated false claims from Russian state media that Ukrainian forces had been shelling a Russian separatist enclave. Kirk's spokesman said at the time that while Kirk disagreed with the Russian invasion, he was "rightly questioning" U.S. foreign policy.[207]
Kirk opposed the U.S. sending arms to Ukraine or helping the country financially.[206] In August 2025, Kirk disagreed with Trump's decision to send more military aid to Ukraine, saying: "We were against it with Biden. Why would we be for it now? Unless it gets us to a peace settlement".[208] He called Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy a "CIA puppet" and "gangster" who "sent his own people to a senseless massacre",[209] claiming that Zelenskyy had no interest in ending the war.[198] Kirk said that Ukraine should cut spending on what he called a war it could not "win".[209] He also claimed that Crimea could not be returned to Ukraine because "it has always been part of Russia".[209]
In November 2024 Kirk offered an "apology" to the Russian people, stating "very few Americans want war with you" and that "the people obsessed with fighting you forever" were a minority "on their way out of power". His post was shared by Russian state-owned news agency RT.[210] Kirk believed that the U.S. was "wrong" to view Russia as an enemy, although he said he did not like "the Russian Federation or Russian dictator Vladimir Putin".[206] At the February 2022 Conservative Political Action Conference, Kirk said that "the southern border matters a lot more than the Ukrainian border" and "I want every Republican leader ... to call what's happening on the southern border an invasion because two million people waltzed into our country last year."[211]
China and Taiwan
Kirk told his listeners in 2025, "I would say, sadly if we took Taiwan, it would probably start a nuclear war. Our leaders have largely mishandled China. We probably should have taken it in 1950 right after World War Two."[212]
Climate change
Kirk promoted climate change denial, calling global warming a hoax.[213] In 2021, a Turning Point USA video featuring Kirk and Candace Owens claimed there is "no factual data to back up global warming" and that scientists do not know the cause; Science Feedback rated the claims inaccurate. Kirk later issued a correction and the video was removed.[214] In 2022, Kirk warned that climate activism would erode American sovereignty and private property, describing it as a Trojan Horse for Marxism and likening it to "pseudo-paganism".[215] He called the statement that climate change is an existential threat "complete gibberish nonsense", stating that if your biggest worry in life is existential, you have a great life, and added that he doesn't believe human activity is the driver of climate change.[138]
Personal life

In May 2021, Kirk married Erika Kirk (née Frantzve), a businesswoman and podcaster who won the Miss Arizona USA pageant competition in 2012.[216][217] The couple's first child, a daughter, was born in 2022.[218][219][220] Their second child, a son, was born in May 2024.[221][220]
Wealth
Charlie Kirk's net worth at the time of death is estimated to have been $12 million. He raised his salary in his non-profit company, Turning Point USA, from $27,000 per year to over $400,000 per year by 2021.[222] His wealth was amassed via various public speaking engagements, media contributions, book sales and real estate. Kirk reportedly charged between $50,000 and $100,000 for live speaking events, and $10,000 to $20,000 for virtual engagements.[223] Kirk's company, Turning Point, gained financial momentum after 2016 once Kirk became politically allied with US president Donald Trump, embracing his presidential campaign. Afterwards, contributions to Turning Point accelerated. According to public tax filings, by 2022, contributions exceeded $79 million.[224] Kirk's real estate portfolio consisted of three properties, including a $4 million estate in Scottsdale, Arizona,[225] and a beachside condominium on the Florida Gulf Coast.[226]
Religious views
Kirk was an evangelical Christian[227] belonging to the Calvary Chapel Association.[47] Prior to the early 2020s, Kirk was described as secular and a critic of religious influence on politics and the state.[42][228] Later he became a Christian nationalist. In 2021, Kirk partnered with California pastor Rob McCoy to launch TPUSA Faith to mobilize conservative Christians to vote Republican. Kirk's shift was influenced by events such as Trump's move of the American embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and COVID-era church closures, which he and his allies portrayed as religious persecution.[42]
Kirk advocated Christian creationism, arguing that evolution is false and that Charles Darwin has been debunked. He has discussed with Randy Guliuzza, the president of the Institute for Creation Research, their support for Young Earth Creationism on his podcast.[229] His YouTube page includes footage of debate on this topic at Kirk's signature Prove Me Wrong table on campus.[230] Speaking on a podcast episode with creationist Stephen Meyer, Kirk said that he was intrigued by Meyer's argument that there was scientific confirmation for intelligent design, contrary to Darwin.[231]
As a religious practice, Kirk said that he kept "a Jewish sabbath", considering it to be a commandment for Christians.[232][233] A book written by Kirk, titled Stop, in the Name of God: Why Honoring the Sabbath Will Transform Your Life, was to be released months after his death, and became a posthumous bestseller.[232]
Death

On September 10, 2025, while on stage at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah, for a TPUSA event, "The American Comeback Tour",[234][235] Kirk was fatally shot in the neck. The shooting took place at 12:23 p.m. MDT (18:23 UTC), around 20 minutes after the event began, in front of an audience of about 3,000 people.[236][237][238]
Immediately before being shot, Kirk was debating mass shootings in the United States. Hunter Kozak, a Utah Valley University undergraduate student, asked "Do you know how many mass shooters there have been in America over the last 10 years?",[239] and Kirk's last words before being shot were his reply, "Counting or not counting gang violence?"[240][92] Kirk was taken to Timpanogos Regional Hospital in critical condition, where he was pronounced dead later that afternoon at the age of 31.[241][242] FBI special agent in charge Robert Bohls described the investigation as "in its early stages" and encouraged members of the public to come forward with information.[243]
United States president Donald Trump addressed the nation from the Oval Office about the shooting, September 10, 2025.
Reactions
Following the shooting and before Kirk was pronounced dead, Trump called for prayers for him on Truth Social.[242][244][245] Several prominent political figures from both parties, including all living former presidents (Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and Joe Biden), echoed the sentiment,[238][242] as did a number of international heads of state.[185][246][247][248]
Some politicians responded to the shooting by linking it to broader political debates. Republicans have accused liberals of "inciting violence with rhetoric", while Democrats have used the event to further discussions of gun control legislation.[249] Far-right activists like Laura Loomer called for violence and revenge in the aftermath of Kirk's killing,[250] and posted identifying details about people they accused of celebrating or justifying Kirk's death.[251] A Secret Service agent was put on leave due to comments made on Facebook about Kirk the day of his death.[252] Several educators across the US were also placed on leave due to negative comments made about Kirk online.[253][254][255]
Legacy and recognition
Kirk was listed on the 2018 Forbes 30 Under 30 in Law & Policy.[256][257] In May 2019, Kirk was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Humanities (D.Hum.) from Liberty University.[258] A day after Kirk's death, on September 11, 2025, Trump announced that Kirk would be posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.[259] Mayor of the city of Netanya in Israel Miriam Feirberg-Ikar [he] announced that a traffic circle in the city will be renamed in honor of Kirk.[260]
On September 10, 2025, Trump ordered that the flag of the United States be flown at half-staff at the White House, on all public buildings and grounds, at all military posts and naval stations, and on all naval vessels of the Federal Government in the District of Columbia and throughout the United States and its Territories and possessions, as a mark of respect for Kirk. The order remained in effect until sunset on September 14.[261]
On September 14, 2025 a public vigil was held for Kirk at John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts and was attended by
Trump administration officials and Republican lawmakers including house speaker Mike Johnson, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, and Health and Human Services director Robert F. Kennedy Jr.[262] A memorial service is scheduled for September 21 at State Farm Stadium in Arizona, which can accommodate over 60,000 people.[263]

We do have a separation of church and state," Kirk told the conservative commentator Dave Rubin in 2018, "and we should support that." Kirk, now 30, has since reversed his position.
