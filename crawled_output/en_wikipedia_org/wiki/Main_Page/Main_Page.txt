Dan Castellaneta, Homer's voice actor
Homer Simpson is a character in the animated television series The Simpsons. He is the boorish father of the Simpson family; with his wife, Marge, he has three children: Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. Homer embodies several American working-class stereotypes: he is overweight, balding, immature, unintelligent, outspoken, aggressive, lazy, ignorant, unprofessional, and fond of beer, junk food, and television. Despite his flaws, he is fundamentally a good-hearted man and fiercely protective of his family, especially during crises. He was created and designed by cartoonist Matt Groening and is voiced by Dan Castellaneta (pictured). Homer is one of the most influential fictional characters on television and is widely recognized as an American cultural icon. His catchphrase, the annoyed grunt "D'oh!", has been included in several dictionaries. Castellaneta has won four Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance, along with a special-achievement Annie Award for voicing Homer. (Full article...)
