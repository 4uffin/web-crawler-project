From today's featured article
Miller in 2014
Myst V: End of Ages is a 2005 adventure video game, developed by Cyan Worlds, published by Ubisoft, and released for Macintosh and Windows PC platforms. Directed by Rand Miller (pictured) it is the fifth installment in the Myst series. Like in past entries, gameplay consists of navigating worlds known as "Ages" via the use of special books and items which act as portals. End of Ages replaces pre-rendered environments used in past games with worlds rendered in real-time 3D graphics, allowing easy navigation. It also includes an in-game camera. Additionally, the faces of actors were digitally mapped onto three-dimensional character models. End of Ages was positively received, despite complaints such as lessened interactivity compared to previous games and poorer graphics. After the game's release Cyan announced the end of software development and the layoff of most of its staff, but was able to rehire much of the development team a few weeks later. (This article is part of a featured topic: Myst series.)

The Freshman
is a 1925 American silent comedy film that tells the story of a college freshman trying to become popular by joining the school football team. It was released on September 20, 1925, and stars Harold Lloyd, Jobyna Ralston, Brooks Benedict, and James Anderson. It remains one of Lloyd's most successful and enduring films. The film was written by John Grey, Sam Taylor, Tim Whelan, and Ted Wilde. It was directed by Taylor and Fred C. Newmeyer. In 1990, The Freshman was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant," added in the second year of voting and one of the first 50 films to receive the honor.
Film credit: Fred C. Newmeyer and Sam Taylor
