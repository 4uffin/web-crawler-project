The red wattlebird is a passerine bird native to southern Australia. With a length of 33–37 cm (13–14½ in), it is the second largest species of Australian honeyeater. It has mainly grey-brown plumage, with red eyes, distinctive pinkish-red wattles on either side of the neck, white streaks on the chest and a large bright yellow patch on the lower belly. Loud and conspicuous, the red wattlebird is generally found in trees, where it gets most of its food; occasionally it forages on the ground. It is one of the largest nectarivorous birds in the world, feeding from a wide variety of flowering plants. Insects also comprise part of its diet. It is territorial and at times aggressive towards birds of other species, often defending rich sources of nectar. Breeding throughout its range, the red wattlebird builds a cup-shaped nest in a tree and raises one or two broods a year. Although it has declined in places from land clearing, it is classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. (Full article...)

The Kuk Early Agricultural Site documents New Guinea's independent development of agriculture.
Papua New Guinea has designated a number of areas as potential UNESCO World Heritage Sites. These sites cover areas of both cultural and natural significance. Only one, the Kuk Early Agricultural Site, has become inscribed as an official site. Archaeology at this site has found evidence of the independent development of agriculture on the island of New Guinea. The other listings remain tentative. Many of these sites were selected following foreign proposals, and while they have national government support, there has been little or no progress towards the protections needed to lodge official nominations since the sites were tentatively listed in 2006. Due to the political power of local communities in the country, any successful nomination would require local support and cooperation. The nomination of this site was made with support from the Kawelka people, who continue to carry out traditional land-use practices at the site. (Full list...)

The 2024 Central European floods were a series of floods caused by a record heavy rainfall generated by Storm Boris, an extremely humid Genoa low. The flooding began in Austria and the Czech Republic, then spread to Poland, Romania and Slovakia, and then onwards to Germany and Hungary. The floods caused 28 fatalities and over 4 billion euros in damage. This photograph shows floodwater surrounding the Franciscan monastery in Kłodzko, Poland, on 15 September 2024.
