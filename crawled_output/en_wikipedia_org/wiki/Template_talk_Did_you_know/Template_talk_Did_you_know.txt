Instructions for nominators[edit]
ShortcutWP:DYKNOMWP:DYKNOM
If this is your first nomination, please read the DYK rules before continuing. Further information can be found at the DYK guidelines.
Nominate an article
Frequently asked questions[edit]
How do I write an interesting hook?
Successful hooks tend to have several traits. Most importantly, they share a surprising or intriguing fact. They give readers enough context to understand the hook, but leave enough out to make them want to learn more. They are written for a general audience who has no prior knowledge of or interest in the topic area. Lastly, they are concise, and do not attempt to cover multiple facts or present information about the subject beyond what's needed to understand the hook.
When will my nomination be reviewed?
This page is often backlogged. As long as your submission is still on the page, it will stay there until an editor reviews it. Since editors are encouraged to review the oldest submissions first, it may take several weeks until your submission is reviewed. In the meantime, please consider reviewing another submission (not your own) to help reduce the backlog (see instructions below). Because of WP:DYKTIMEOUT, a nomination should be reviewed within two months since the reviewer/promoter may agree to reject and close an unpromoted hook after that time has passed.
Where is my hook?
If you can't find the nomination you submitted to this nominations page, it may have been approved and is on the approved nominations page waiting to be promoted. It could also have been added to one of the prep areas,
promoted from prep to a queue, or is on the main page.
If the nominated hook is in none of those places, then the nomination has probably been rejected. Such a rejection usually only occurs if it was at least a couple of weeks old and had unresolved issues for which any discussion had gone stale. If you think your nomination was unfairly rejected, you can query this on the DYK discussion page or with the closer, but as a general rule such nominations will only be restored in exceptional circumstances. If your nomination was promoted, but it hasn't reached the main page after two weeks, you can also query this on the DYK discussion page.
Instructions for reviewers[edit]
Main page: Wikipedia:Did you know/Reviewer instructions
Any editor who was not involved in writing/expanding or nominating an article may review it by checking to see that the article meets all the DYK criteria (long enough, new enough, no serious editorial or content issues) and the hook is cited. Editors may also alter the suggested hook to improve it, suggest new hooks, or even lend a hand and make edits to the article to which the hook applies so that the hook is supported and accurate. For more information on the DYK rules and review processes, see the DYK guidelines and the reviewer instructions.
To post a comment or review on a DYK nomination, follow the steps outlined below:
Look through this page, Template talk:Did you know, to find a nomination you would like to comment on.
Click the "Review or comment" link at the top of the nomination. You will be taken to the nomination subpage.
The top of the page includes a list of the DYK criteria. Check the article to ensure it meets all the relevant criteria.
To indicate the result of the review (i.e., whether the nomination passes, fails, or needs some minor changes), leave a signed comment on the page. Please begin with one of the 5 review symbols that appear at the top of the edit screen, and then indicate all aspects of the article that you have reviewed; your comment should look something like the following:Article length and age are fine, no copyvio or plagiarism concerns, reliable sources are used. But the hook needs to be shortened.
If you are the first person to comment on the nomination, there will be a line :* <!-- REPLACE THIS LINE TO WRITE FIRST COMMENT, KEEPING
:*
--> showing you where you should put the comment.
Save the page.
After the nomination is approved, a bot will automatically list the nomination page on Template talk:Did you know/Approved.
If there is any problem or concern about a nomination, please consider notifying the nominator by placing {{subst:DYKproblem|Article|header=yes|sig=yes}} on the nominator's talk page.
Advanced procedures[edit]
How to promote an accepted hook[edit]
At-a-glance instructions on how to promote an approved hook to a prep area
See Wikipedia:Did you know/Preparation areas for details on verifying a hook's acceptability.
Promoters should not promote their own nomination or their own review.
When promoting hooks intended for a particular date, keep in mind that when the number of available approved nominations exceeds 120 we switch to two sets per day, and when that number drops below 60 we return to one set per day.
Check list for nomination review completeness
Select a hook from the approved nominations page that has one of these ticks at the bottom post:
.
Check to make sure basic review requirements were completed.
Any outstanding issue following
needs to be addressed before promoting.
Check the article history for any substantive changes since it was nominated or reviewed.
Images for the lead slot must be freely licensed. Fair-use images are not permitted. Images loaded on Commons that appear on the Main Page are automatically protected by KrinkleBot.
Hook must be stated in both the article and source (which must be cited at the end of the article sentence where stated).
Hook should make sense grammatically.
Try to vary subject matters within each prep area.
Try to select a funny, quirky or otherwise upbeat hook for the last or bottom hook in the set.
Steps to add a hook to prep
In one tab, open the nomination page of the hook you want to promote.
In a second tab, open the prep set you intend to add the hook to.
Wanna skip all this fuss? Install WP:PSHAW instead! Does most of the heavy lifting for ya :)
For hooks held for specific dates, refer to "Local update times" section on
DYK Queue.
Completed Prep area number sets will be promoted by an administrator to corresponding Queue number.
Copy and paste the hook into a chosen slot.
Make sure there's a space between ... and that, and a ? at the end.
Check that there's a bold link to the article.
If it's the lead (first) hook, paste the image where indicated at the top of the template.
Copy and paste ALL the credit information (the {{DYKmake}} and {{DYKnom}} templates) at the bottom
Check your work in the prep's Preview mode.
At the bottom under "Credits", to the right of each article should have the link "View nom subpage" ; if not, a subpage parameter will need to be added to the DYKmake.
Save the Prep page.
Closing the DYK nomination page
At the upper left
Change {{DYKsubpage to {{subst:DYKsubpage
Change |passed= to |passed=yes
At the bottom
Just above the line containing }}<!--Please do not write below this line or remove this line. Place comments above this line.-->
insert a new, separate line containing one of the following:
To [[TM:DYK/P1|Prep 1]]
To [[TM:DYK/P2|Prep 2]]
To [[TM:DYK/P3|Prep 3]]
To [[TM:DYK/P4|Prep 4]]
To [[TM:DYK/P5|Prep 5]]
To [[TM:DYK/P6|Prep 6]]
To [[TM:DYK/P7|Prep 7]]
Also paste the same thing into the edit summary.
Check in Preview mode. Make sure everything is against a pale blue background (nothing outside) and there are no stray characters, like }}, at the top or bottom.
Save.
For more information, please see T:TDYK#How to promote an accepted hook.

How to remove a rejected nomination[edit]
Open the DYK nomination subpage of the nomination you would like to remove.
In the window where the DYK nomination subpage is open, replace the line {{DYKsubpage with {{subst:DYKsubpage, and replace |passed= with |passed=no. Then save the page. This has the effect of wrapping up the discussion on the DYK nomination subpage in a blue archive box and stating that the nomination was unsuccessful, as well as adding the nomination to a category for archival purposes.
Alternatively, you can use PSHAW, which automates the process.
How to remove a hook from the prep areas or queue[edit]
Edit the prep area or queue where the hook is and remove the hook and the credits associated with it.
Go to the hook's nomination subpage (there should have been a link to it in the credits section).
View the edit history for that page
Go back to the last version before the edit where the hook was promoted, and revert to that version to make the nomination active again.
Add a new icon on the nomination subpage to cancel the previous tick and leave a comment after it explaining that the hook was removed from the prep area or queue, and why, so that later reviewers are aware of this issue.
Add a transclusion of the template back to this page so that reviewers can see it. It goes under the date that it was first created/expanded/listed as a GA. You may need to add back the day header for that date if it had been removed from this page.
If you removed the hook from a queue, it is best to either replace it with another hook from one of the prep areas, or to leave a message at WT:DYK asking someone else to do so.
How to move a nomination subpage to a new name[edit]
Don't; it should not ever be necessary, and will break some links which will later need to be repaired. Even if you change the title of the article, you don't need to move the nomination page.

... that an oil-rig trailer was used to help build a Texas TV station? (nom)
I don't know what an oil-rig trailer is (I can guess, but I wouldn't put my house on it) and it's not explained in the article either. Black Kite (talk) 12:31, 26 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Per Launchballer, I approved it as something that we probably thinking. Maybe, let's ask @Sammi Brie: to probably put a brief explanation of it on the sentence on the article, maybe not in the hook itself as it is part of the "hooky" part Warm Regards, Miminity (Talk?) (me contribs) 13:04, 26 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I personally thought the hook was self-evident. Even if you don't know exactly what an oil-rig trailer is (and I had to look it up just now to see what one looks like), just seeing that something oil-related was involved was enough to raise curiosity. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 13:06, 26 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Well yes, but if you then go to the article to find out what it is, you'll be disappointed. So I think Miminity's suggestion that the article has an explanatory sentence is a good idea. Black Kite (talk) 13:12, 26 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]
If the average people don't get it and it needs to be explained, I'm going to suggest it's not WP:DYKINT and should be pulled. TarnishedPathtalk 15:55, 26 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I don't know what it is and looking it up is providing... inconsistent information. If it's an actually consistent thing, is it notable? If not, is it covered in some page we have on trucks or trailers we can link to? CMD (talk) 16:14, 26 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I was going right off the source: With both the equipment and the fork lift at the bottom of the hill. Terry had to come up with something to transport them up the hill. That turned out to be an oll rig trailer and winch. But you're right that this is very unusual wording. Can this be salvaged with something new or rewording?

When evaluating for prep, I see the hook doesn't check out. The source says nothing about this or any other album being one of the first to use a DAW, and it doesn't say who might have thought this. I think this nomination needs a new hook (or a new source if indeed the hook is accurate.) @100cellsman and Toadboy123: please review/comment, thanks! Dclemens1971 (talk) 02:37, 5 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I'm currently unable to search for sources using ProQuest with the Wikipedia Library card due to my lack of recent edits, and regular search engines aren't reliable these days. But even so, I think the hook checks out now. When I was doing research I don't recall seeing the album being the very first to use a DAW, but more of the band exploring a DAW. And I failed to see that ProTools was released just years before the album came out. Thank you for the review. 웃OO 03:57, 5 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The source doesn't even say anything about it being "one of the first", it just says it was Gane and McEntire’s first experience with Pro Tools, that DAWs were relatively new and that Pro Tools was at that moment becoming the primary platform -- but it doesn't say anything about anyone thinking this album was one of the first to be made using a DAW. Dclemens1971 (talk) 12:40, 5 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@user0 In this case, try generating a alternate hook that is accurately sourced and cited. - Toadboy123 (talk) 15:13, 7 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

@RobinIsadorable: Hello, and welcome to DYK. Right now, I would suggest that you propose a new hook, as the current one may not be considered interesting to those unfamiliar with the Wave-Gotik-Treffen or Ships in the Night. Will you be able to do that? If you need any help our guidance, feel free to let me or another editor know. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 10:41, 31 July 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Narutolovehinata5: Hi, thank you for your comment! I added an alternative hook. Would appreciate any additional guidance if that doesn't work either. RobinIsadorable (talk) 14:55, 31 July 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Yes, the new hook works. I've struck the original. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 23:39, 31 July 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Thank you for article and hook, User:RobinIsadorable, - nice to meet you, and I agree with your user name ;) - The article is detailed and referenced throughout. I wonder about the pronoun, beginning with "their" but then "she"? - Please find something to link the article to. - Normally there would be a link to the performer. As they have no article, there should be a redirect from their name to this article, and the name should be bold. A bit more about the person (birth day or year, place of birth, education ...) would be nice. - The image is licensed and a good illustration. It would perhaps be stronger if cropped, because the detail on the left doesn't show well in stamp-size. I trimmed the caption. - We should not use a given name in the article once the full name was introduced, also no link is needed for New York City. - A bit about the vocals would also be great. - The last refs should be in ascending order. - In the hook, perhaps you want to include something like insomnia, rather than all three outside sounds. - --Gerda Arendt (talk) 13:04, 5 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]

@Gerda Arendt: Thank you for the feedback! I'll try to address your points. In regards to pronouns, I tried to use they/them/their when referring to the musical project Ships in the Night and she/her/hers when referring to Leventhal (though I will say I don't see their pronouns personally stated in any sources, so I'm a little hesitant to stick with she/her/hers). Couldn't really find information about Leventhal's personal details. In the hook, I decided to focus on melody inspirations in order to convey the kinds of sounds that inspire the music rather than subject matter (which is inspired by or deals with a number of different topics) for brevity's sake. I could definitely expand the hook to include that. I added a redirect from Alethea Leventhal. I think your other points were addressed by other editors including a photo crop found here: File:WGT 2025 Ships In The Night 01 (cropped).jpg.
Thank you for explaining. The cropped image is better suitable for the Main page. --Gerda Arendt (talk) 06:26, 19 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hi @RobinIsadorable, Gerda Arendt, Launchballer,
and Narutolovehinata5: I'm just reopening this one because I've just reviewed this article in the Queue and I became confused by the flipping between discussion of the "band" Ships in the Night versus the "singer" Alethea Leventhal. And I see that Gerda raised similar issues in her comment above, so this seems like something that should be addressed. In particular, a few points:
It is unclear if Ships in the Night has become a de facto stage name for Leventhal, or if there is a clear distinction between the act under one name and the individual under the other. The attached image showing the individual but using the group name adds to this confusion.
There is a strong implication through the article that Leventhal identifies as non-binary, with repeated use of they/them pronouns. For example "In 2024, Leventhal signed with Metropolis Records to release their third full-length album, Protection Spells". But from what I can gather, Leventhal in fact identifies as female and is referred to in sources as she/her. I think this needs to be made clearer, probably through consistency in which bits of the article refer to the individual and which to the "band".
Nothing insurmountable here, and thanks to RobinIsadorable for writing this and submitting your first DYK, we just need a little bit of tidying up I think. I will help out myself if I have some time in the coming days, but a little busy right now. Cheers  — Amakuru (talk) 09:52, 3 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Yup! The actual mixtape is still coming. Sources, and Tyla herself, called the EP a bridge to the LP. Therefore, I don't think it's out of date. She pulled the very same move with her debut studio album and Christina Aguilera did the same with Aguilera. Oh, and I see you've put commas before the word "and", at GA and PR/FAC, they gonna remove those. Struggled a lot with that in the past. dxneo (talk) 02:20, 26 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I've never engaged in an argument about commas and don't have any plans to do so in the future.
Not at all clear what you mean by "they gonna remove those" so I'll leave it you to use them as you prefer.
However, even if the material isn't out of date, the "Background and release" doesn't make much sense the way it is currently written, moving from singles to mixtape, to a scheduled release at some point in the future, to the EP and then back to the mixtape, and then to the future LP.

Full review needed; per DYKcheck article is 5x expanded since July 27, and nominating eight days after expansion began is perfectly legal per DYK rules. BlueMoonset (talk) 21:16, 9 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The article was created in 2016 and received a 5x expansion 7-8 days before the nomination. The article is largely free from close paraphrasing, but the problem is that some parts appear to be very close to this link. That will need to be addressed before this can be reviewed further, although as Launchballer said, that might bring the article to below a 5x expansion, so keep that in mind. A QPQ has been performed and it is a complete one. The hook is cited inline and interesting, although the Newspapers.com link doesn't actually mention that exact quote, so an excerpt may be needed here. Technically, the hook is not DYKHFC compliant, but I will accept it as is because the entire quote is referenced to a single source.
The elephant in the room is that I actually think that him becoming an accomplished doctor after his running career is the more interesting hook fact here. I know that some DYK editors are not fans of "person A, who was a B, was later a C" hooks, but in this case it actually is unusual and interesting. I would suggest proposing that as an ALT, although the nomination's fate depends on the close paraphrasing being resolved.

Comment: 1st, don't worry. You only need to check the hook most interesting to you.
2nd, if you really deeply prefer ALT1 or ALT2, just message my talk page and I'll redo the article to explicitly mention the needed point. 3rd, kindly do not add any links to the provided hooks. DYK is here to drive traffic to new/improved articles. People curious about Qin Hui or Hangzhou can get there from the links in the Tomb of Yue Fei page and don't need them in the hooks themselves.

@LlywelynII: This is just a comment, but I would suggest toning down your "please no links" comments in your nominations moving forward, as other editors may find their tone to be too harsh. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 22:45, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Narutolovehinata5: No idea what you are on about. It's a clear statement and reminder of preference to people who (without ill intent) randomly add links to these things, as encountered numerous times over years of participation in DYK. You don't seem to be speaking for anyone else but, ok, out of morbid curiosity, what would your proposed phrasing be? — LlywelynII 11:13, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@LlywelynII: A shorter message, one that does not include bolds/italics/underlines, would probably go a long way. Another solution, one that could work in parallel, would be to avoid mentioning unfamiliar names whenever possible if they're not necessary to the hook, or to at least provide some context. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 11:29, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
That isn't proposed phrasing, just more criticism of a note that has been effective and unoffensive to everyone apart from yourself, since it already is perfectly polite assuming you're assuming good faith. As for the rest, if you had additional ALTs to propose, you're welcome to but that's what's actually making the entry seem intimidating to prospective reviewers. (Hence the necessity of the 1st comment.) Anyway, thanks for stopping by. — LlywelynII 11:37, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I do not understand why you are seemingly accusing me of assuming bad faith. All I said was that the comment seemed needlessly harsh or even aggressive. Even a simple message that went "I would prefer there to be no other blue links in the article" or something to that effect would have worked just as effectively. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 12:57, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
No bad faith, just—since you're still writing and seeking clarification—very judgmental and passive aggressive nitpicking without any constructive content despite repeated attempts to elicit some. Yes, the current phrasing and formatting are effective and, thus far, have only been offputting to you, an editor who didn't improve the nomination itself, the articles, or perform a review. (See below for a second opinion.) No, the suggested text wouldn't be effective either here or upon promotion. It's too weakly phrased and would be lost in the sea of text from the ALTs, the notes, and the comments. That said, thanks again for the good that you do do & keep on with that, ideally with greater consideration for others and humility going forward. — LlywelynII 13:56, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I'll review this in the next 24 hours; so far, my preference is a trimmed version of ALT4.--Launchballer 18:24, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@LlywelynII: Long enough, new enough. QPQ complete and Earwig has no valid complaints. You won't be able to put "piss" or "shit" in the main page in this formulation as neither are encyclopedic language, which I adjusted this in the article, and I'd suggest trimming ALT4 to ALT4a: ... that statues at the tomb of Yue Fei (pictured) have been ritually defecated on for centuries?. The Introduction source says that "for centuries, these statues have been cursed, spat and urinated upon by people" and I can't see the Grand Documentation source; per WP:DYKHOOK, I must ask for a quote from the source. Also, I reject Naruto's argument that "kindly do not add any links to the provided hooks" is in the least bit incivil; this is a perfectly reasonable request given WP:DYKMAJOR.--Launchballer 13:23, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Launchballer: Piss and shit are encyclopedic, and it's a bit silly to think that 'urinate' or 'excrete waste material' capture the intended approbation. WP:TONE & WP:NOTCENS actually say that things shouldn't be needlessly bawdlerized or reformatted into medical jargon in a cultural article. (See, e.g., enshittification.) That said, you're the reviewer and fine. You don't like it, there's no one else here, and we can phrase things your preferred way. Thanks for your time, your support, and lemme see about getting you that cite. — LlywelynII 13:56, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
ALT7: ... that statues at the tomb of Yue Fei (pictured) in Hangzhou, China, have been ritually defecated on for centuries?
ALT8: ... that statues at the tomb of Yue Fei (pictured) in Hangzhou, China, were ritually defecated on for centuries?
The other cites underline that it's been a continuing tradition since the Ming but the relevant and directly fecal-related bit from the Grand Documentarian is "Even in the early twentieth century, when Boerschmann visited the temple, male visitors spat and emptied their bowels on the statues. 'The condition of the place, one might easily imagine,' he wrote." The slightly modified phrasing in ALT8 underlines that the shitting really has largely stopped by this point; people still spit &c. but local police would not take kindly to continued indulgence in the less sanitary traditions at the modern tourist spot. If you run into similar problems elsewhere as Google Books continues to grow more and more enfecalized, one current kludge is to make sure you're using &newbks=0 to turn off its most deliberate attempts to not work plus &pg=PA### where ### is whatever the relevant page number is. — LlywelynII 14:19, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

@Dclemens1971: I tried to summarize a quote (or two). Ian Eisendrath, a main producer of the songs, said their goal was to create one of those super bubblegum-y K-pop boy band songs hence "catchy", and a later quote If you really look at them, the underpinning is like, ‘We’re going to devour you. We’re going to eat you up. We are going to drink you up’ because that’s what the demons do hence "deceiving".

@TheNuggeteer: Watch for the link to a dab page in the hook.

Thank you for going to so much effort for us, with the picture. However I have had to replace your new picture with the original, which I have rotated (using Gimp) for the same reason (and I never use AI either). However I have retained the original genuine colour. This billiard room is in a sensitively restored Victorian building, which means it has Victorian muted colours. The walls are a rich maroon, not cheap scarlet, and the baize on the tables is a discreetly gentle shade.

Welcome to DYK! What a thorough article -- you could consider nominating it as a Good Article too. The DYK criteria look well met. Regarding the hook, DYK strongly discourages "first"-based hooks and I don't think ALT0 will work. ALT1 is supported by the source, but as written doesn't strike me as very interesting to a non-specialist. I'd propose the following as something with a "catchier" wording that is still supported by the source:
ALT2: ... that Viktor Glondys converted from Catholicism to Lutheranism while the Away from Rome! movement was popular, but he had his own reasons?
If you're OK with that hook suggestion, we could go with that, or you could suggest some others. There may be something interesting to do with the wars, eg, fleeing on foot shortly after his doctorate, or the controversial Good Samarital speech. The trick (and it is tricky) is to boil down the details into something that feels accessible and leaves the reader wanting more to piece it together. ~ L 🌸 (talk) 08:47, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@LEvalyn: Hi, thank you for the feedback. I think what you suggested would be a good hook that I would be fine with, but also, since you suggested the speech here is another one if it might be better:
... that Viktor Glondys delivered a sermon in 1931 based on the Good Samaritan that rejected Nazi racial ideology, prompting attacks from pro-Nazi groups?
Here are the sources for that one:

I came here from the WP:CGR page, where I saw that this article had been nominated for DYK. I know nothing about the DYK process, but my impression of the article itself is mostly negative. In order to avoid cluttering up the DYK template, I've started a separate section on the talk page listing some of the problems (misspellings, ungrammatical sentences, inadequate sources, sources not properly credited, at least three citations that fail verification). WP:DYK says "Articles must meet the basic criteria set out on this page, but do not have to be of very high quality". Fair enough. I don't know how low the bar is; perhaps this is within the range considered normal and acceptable at DYK. But to me, as an outsider to the process, it certainly does not seem "good to go", or ready to be featured on the front page.

You need to cite external, reliable sources, in the same sense you would cite the article you nominated. Is there a source in the article to back this claim? I also don't feel like this hook requires a picture. Roast (talk) 00:40, 11 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The sources are the ones the internal anchors link to. I had done in that in prior DYK nominations and it had been fine?
They go to this and this.
For the image, is the issue the selected image? Would you prefer the Ivanka Trump one? It's an article on a very visual topic, so an image seems helpful.

It didn't redirect me to the footnote when I clicked it, which is most likely fault of my device. The sources are reliable and back the claim. As for the image, yes I think a photograph of Ivanka would be a better fit. The "(pictured)" thing also needs to follow the mention of Mar-a-Lago Face, likely with additional need to say it's Ivanka, something like "...that the Mar-a-Lago face, a (example pictured: Ivanka Trump", an appearance popular with Republican women, has been compared to gender-affirming care and drag?").

I have an issue with the image caption. There is only one source in the article supporting the idea that the face is modeled after Ivanka, and that source attributes the claim to a single surgeon. The quote is actually "often modeled after Ivanka Trump’s signature look", which is a fair distance from "based on Ivanka Trump". ꧁Zanahary꧂ 15:41, 19 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I've updated the caption.
— Very Polite Person (talk/contribs) 15:42, 19 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I still don't think a single claim attributed to some Californian surgeon in a HuffPost article is a good enough source for this to appear on the front page. If it's true that the look is based on Ivanka's, there should be multiple quality sources saying so. ꧁Zanahary꧂ 15:48, 19 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]

The hook covers (it took some effort) a variety of the interesting items in the article, which I worked into the hook with a fair bit of effort. So is your issue JUST with the comparison to Ivanka and the image, or is your issue with the DYK itself? I want to know your precise position so that if there is a concern, I can address it head-on, with clear focused understanding of what your issue is. And, being honest, I've had terrible luck with vague editors and those prone to move goalposts, which I am not a fan of. Can you please be crystal clear in your concerns?
— Very Polite Person (talk/contribs) 15:57, 19 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Sure: the notion that Ivanka is the model for the face is too tenuously sourced, and the "comparison" to gender-affirming care is sourced entirely from a single rhetorical one-liner in a Mother Jones piece. Neither of these are strong enough to be on the main page. ꧁Zanahary꧂ 16:30, 19 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I've now triple-sourced that Ivanka Trump is the basis/inspiration for the look, including direct quotes from surgeons.
— Very Polite Person (talk/contribs) 17:30, 19 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]
These sources are all poor. HuffPost's is one surgeon. Glam.com (seemingly a very low-quality source, whose front page shows me authoritative hits like 4 Common Excuses That Make You Sound Self-Centered between seemingly infinite articles about celebrities' shocking plastic surgery transformations and elegant style evolutions) just reprints a surgeon's quote in the terrible WP:Daily Mail, and the Voce di New York (an outlet with basically no pedigree or footprint at all) piece is just a few paragraphs long and claims without substantiation that two surgeons say more people are asking to look like Ivanka. Neither of the quoted surgeons in the piece seem to say anything supporting that notion, and the piece does not even posit a direct basal relationship between Ivanka Trump and Mar-a-Lago face. This is just bad sourcing for a fun claim, and I get that fun claims like this one are fun, but without actual high-quality sourcing directly supporting it, "Mar-a-Lago face is based on Ivanka Trump" does not meet the encyclopedic standard of Wikipedia's front page.꧁Zanahary꧂ 19:49, 19 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]
This DYK nomination is ill-considered. The "K" in DYK is know, meaning it should be solid and notable fact.
"Compared to gender-affirming care" is weasel-wording, not a statement it is factually gender-affirming care for a DYK. Also, compared by whom? Maybe one or two utterly non-notable people who were clearly having fun with applying the phrase to the trans-phobic MAGA movement. It was not a claim the women needed surgery in order to look like women, which is what the phrase usually means.
Similarly for comparing the Mar-a-Lago look to drag, which is again very thinly sourced, is a weasely compared and not a DYK fact.
Unrelated to DYK nomination: the inclusion of the eye-catching and large drag picture in this article based on a non-notable offhand remark is ill-considered.

A 5x expansion has been verified by DYK check and I did not find any close paraphrasing. A QPQ has been verified and it is a complete review. The article is long enough for DYK purposes and meets the referencing guidelines.
However, the hook is problematic. Firstly, it is not directly stated in the article: nowhere does it say that it was "marketed with copies signed by Henrietta Stannard". Second, even if the claim was mentioned, it doesn't seem to actually be referenced. Thirdly, and most worryingly, even if those issues were addressed, the hook would not meet WP:DYKINT. The context here is that Winter is actually Stannard's penname, but the average reader may not be familiar with either name, so the connection is lost. Even without the context, the hook does not seem very interesting if the reader is unfamiliar with Stannard and her work (FWIW I've never heard of her prior to this nomination).
You have done a good job of expanding the article, but to be honest, after reading it, I'm not sure if there's actually anything here that's workable. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 02:26, 28 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]

My apologies for the delay— my off-wiki life has been tumultuous this week. In the next few days I can look for an alternative hook; there may be something I can add to the article with the film adaptation. I personally don’t think the hook relies on knowing either name (she’s a completely obscure author) but I think it’s interesting that she basically makes her pseudonym useless (which I think the cited ad verifies); I may be able to come up with a better wording for that idea. Regardless I’d appreciate a few days to work on it, please, with my thanks for your thorough review. ~ L 🌸 (talk) 20:33, 31 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Narutolovehinata5, what do you think about ALT1: ...that Henrietta Stannard autographed copies of John Strange Winter’s novel Lady Jennifer?
That phrasing is definitely verified by the ad, which has the headline Autographed Copies of John Strange Winter's Latest Novel and says Mrs. Stannard ("John Strange Winter") will be pleased to send a specially signed copy... My aim is to intrigue someone who has never heard of either name -- I think it's interesting that she's a woman with a male pseudonym who is undermining that pseudonym with her marketing campaign.
Or, perhaps another angle is something like ALT2: ...that Henrietta Stannard bundled her novel Lady Jennifer with promotional materials for John Strange Winter's Toilet Preparations?
I'd have to beef it up in the article a bit but the mail-in autograph promo automatically gave a free copy of Comely Woman with every Lady Jennifer, and elsewhere I've seen info about how this book basically just sold her cosmetics line. ~ L 🌸 (talk) 20:04, 2 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Regrettably, I do not think this Stannard/Strange Winter angle will work out, as the main issue (that the hooks do not make sense or will not interest people who do not know either name or at least the context) remains. I understand what you're trying to get to, but it's not showing in the hook proposals, and given what is in the article, the angle just seems like a non-starter. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 22:16, 2 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
You don't think the cosmetics line part is any better? I didn't think that one relied on the author's names, and in fact we could remove Stannard's name entirely, i.e., ALT3: ... that the novel Lady Jennifer cross-promoted John Strange Winter's Toilet Preparations? (Again, I'd be able to beef up the article properly for that if it seemed like an interesting angle.) I thought "Toilet Preparations" might also be an intriguing product name for a general audience. ~ L 🌸 (talk) 23:17, 2 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
ALT3 is a bit of a weird one in that I'm 50-50. On the one hand, it doesn't solve the "you must know who John Strange Winter" issue, but on the other hand, the name itself along with "Toilet Preparations" might be enough to raise attention. I'm undecided at this point, so I think it might be a good idea to ask for a second opinion from one of the usual DYK scrutinizers like RoySmith, Amakuru, Launchballer, etc. I should note that, if ever, only ALT3 is under consideration, and all the other hooks, particularly those involving the name Henrietta Stannard, are rejected.

I wrote all of the film material after the 5x expansion so it's not needed to meet that criteria. Also, I am in the process of merging the articles on the WP:PAGEDECIDE principle that there is no need to have two articles and a DAB for a topic with so little (relatively) to say. ~ L 🌸 (talk) 23:09, 2 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Narutolovehinata5, LEvalyn, RoySmith,
and Amakuru: I'm fine with ALT3.--Launchballer 12:07, 5 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Here since I was pinged above – personally I would not sign off on ALT3. As someone unfamiliar with the subject, the hook as written makes no sense to me. Who is John Strange Winter, and ehat are "Toilet Preparations" (particularly when rendered in title case like this)? And how exactly does the book "cross-promote" them? And then it's not immediately obvious where in the article to look. The words "Toilet" and "cross-promote" don't appear anywhere in the article and it turns out "Toilet Preparations" is actually "J. S. W. Preparations". No offence to anyone, but IMHO it seems a little weak to me to premise the hook on a pun on the word toilet that doesn't even appear in the article.
As an aside, I agree with the comment above that the film article should be redirected to this one, there isn't enough content overall for two separate articles on these closely related topics at this time and WP:NOPAGE would apply for me. It's a pity the WP:BLAR was reverted, it might have to go through AFD or a merge discussion on the talk page. Cheers  — Amakuru (talk) 13:08, 5 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Thanks for weighing in, and thanks to Narutolovehinata5 for your patience with this one. With regret, I'll withdraw the DYK.

Though to be clear Amakuru, they really were called John Strange Winter's Toilet Preparations! I just hadn't clipped the source for the article yet. ~ L 🌸 (talk) 18:36, 5 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hi @LEvalyn: thanks for the reply, and if you're able to make the hook tally up with something in the article I'll be happy to re-evaluate it... I haven't looked at this in detail, but hopefully either way we can save something from this, no need to throw in the towel just yet! Cheers  — Amakuru (talk) 19:25, 5 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
That's very kind, Amakuru. The article now says To promote the book, Stannard offered signed copies by mail order... With the novel, she included free copies of Comely Woman, a book of advice promoting her line of cosmetics products, John Strange Winter Toilet Preparations (with a wikilink to Toilet#Names to help solve the mystery of the name), and I've named the section "Publication and promotion" to make it easier to spot. To a certain extent I think "Who is John Strange Winter and what are 'Toilet Preparations'?" is the "intrigue" I was hoping to raise-- hopefully the article now has answers to those. Maybe some more compelling or clearer wordings:

Impersonations of United States immigration officials

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impersonations_of_United_States_immigration_officials#cite_note-Bethune_ICE_2025-06-24-1
From source:
Over the past few months, there have been chronic reports of individuals posing as Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials, in many cases using these guises to commit unlawful acts. Impersonation of law enforcement is not an uncommon occurrence in the United States, but the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration policies, and the particular ways in which ICE enjoys anonymity, have led to increased opportunities for such behavior, endangering and exploiting immigrants and their communities, regardless of their status.

Considering we're not short of Trump-related hooks running lately, and given that US politics is a contentious topic, it might be a good idea to avoid mentioning Trump by name in the hook. People might accuse us of Trump bashing if we run too many hooks related to him or his administration. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 05:26, 1 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Neutrality is an internal-to-the-project factor, not a wider-world factor. We piss off someone with everything we do. The new article is literally downstream by (many) RS from the blunt name of the second article.
— Very Polite Person (talk/contribs) 15:47, 1 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Is mentioning Trump's name actually necessary for the hook fact? Isn't there a way to say the same thing or idea without mentioning him? To others, even just saying that impersonation exists may be an interesting-enough fact regardless of the reason (even if the reason might be obvious).

How about...
ALT1: ...that impersonations of United States immigration officials are a chronic crime problem due to deportation policies in the USA?
Is this what you mean? Or like a different target for the second link? I think that was the most fitting target, but maybe another can work. I think most name him however... — Very Polite Person (talk/contribs) 23:29, 1 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I'm not sure if "chronic crime problem" is the best wording here, but that's getting close. The idea I had was something like, instead of saying it was a crime, the interesting fact here is that the issue exists at all, or to reverse the order of their mention. Something like "that deportation policies led to a rise in impersonation". Another possible option would be to avoid mentioning the deportation policies and instead to say that "there has been a rise of impersonations since [year]" or something along the lines of that fact; this is not just to avoid mentioning the policies, but it also avoids mentioning the reason, thus "hooking" readers to read the article and learn why it is happening. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 23:41, 1 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
ALT2: ... that deportation policies in the United States led to increased opportunities for imposters to pose as immigration officials?
ALT3: ... that impersonations of United States immigration officials have become a chronic crime problem in 2025?
Do you mean a structrual flip like this? I feel like excluding the c-word here could be problematic so basically every source frames it in that context. Any instance of it is literally a Federal crime, automatically.
I think I really like ALT3...

Gen-Mina people, Mina (historical ethnic term)
( Comment or view )( Article history links: Gen-Mina peopleMina (historical ethnic term) )
... that a 16th century ethnic term used in Africa is still used today for a Brazilian religion, a Togolese and Beninese ethnic group, and their language?
Source: ""Mina" was, however, as Hall correctly notes, certainly a term which was applied in Brazil, in some contexts, to speakers of Gbe languages. The "Casa das Minas [House of the Minas]" in Sao Luis in the province of Maranhao, for example, is a cult-house of specifically Dahomian origin, venerating spirits associated with the royal dynasty of Dahomey."Law, Robin (2005).

"The name "Minas" remained in use under French colonial rule in the twentieth century, and indeed down to the present, to refer to the inhabitants of Agbodrafo, Aneho and Glidji, and Agoue; although there remains an awareness locally that it should properly be applied only to the Elmina element in Aneho (and its offshoots), a.s distinct from the Gas at Glidji.33 It is not quite accurate, however, to state as does Hall, that these people "call themselves" Mina.34 Rather, this is an external, European coinage, which is nowadays used locally only when speaking in French. At a conference held at Aneho in 2000, I recall a member of the local community insisting that "the Minas exist only for scholars," the self-appellation of the people in their own language being "Gen.""Law, Robin (2005).

He had won a university-wide appropriation for UVM, he had cut tuition for most Vermont students nearly in half, and he had also established the principle de facto that the rate of in-state tuition was directly related to the size of the appropriation provided by the State of Vermont." (p. 291).

@Viriditas:, reading on this again, I'm sort of concerned that multiple usages of the university publications, the Ford Foundation, and Borgmann's own commencement address falls into WP:PRIMARY territory. The hook could've been explained in the article earlier, but you'd have to read until the legacy section where this is explicitly said. I'd also say that his climate change findings also deserve to be there as it is still talked about 60 years later. Howard the Duck (talk) 00:01, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I think you might have misread something. I would guess that 90% of this material is supported by secondary sources, some of which are connected to a university. None of it is promotional. If you have specific concerns, please share them with an example or two that illustrates what you are talking about. I don’t understand why you think the hook needs to be earlier in the article; I’ve never heard that idea before. As for climate change in legacy, you’re not exactly wrong, but you’re not exactly right.
His “legacy” of giving climate talks and writing papers on conservation was only revealed by a climate historian last month. Thinking about this further, I think you may have misunderstood my style.
The way I use primary sources most of the time is not to support the material.
Most of the secondary sources already do it.
The way I tend to do it is to point to the original source of the event or claim. So in the example of the commencement, there are multiple secondaries that point to the significance of his speech.
That’s why they published excerpts from the commencement and it’s why the journal articles cite the speech.
They are asserting the significance of it by using it. The link to the commencement, however, has nothing to do with this.
It is used to show that the speech actually occurred and as a historical pointer to his name and role in the original event. Furthermore, this isn’t the only commencement speech he gave. However, I did not cover the others because the secondary source coverage was almost nonexistent.
I found blurbs in newspapers from the time, but that’s almost primary due to its age. Therefore, they don’t appear in the bio. Viriditas (talk) 00:29, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
It's not exactly promotional, but the Ford Foundation talking about the Ford Foundation or people connected to it such as in ref #16; see for example ref #7, which is still about the Ford Foundation, but is published by a third party. Compare again ref #2, #3, ref #9; then compare to third party sources in ref #10. See WP:PRIMARYCARE: "The person's autobiography, own website, or a page about the person on an employer's or publisher's website, is an acceptable (although possibly incomplete) primary‡ source for information about what the person says about themself. Such primary sources can normally be used for non-controversial facts about the person and for clearly attributed controversial statements." (Emphasis mine.) I have no problem with these as used on the article.
There was an opportunity to explicitly say how much the reduction was on the middle part of the article. I would've preferred for this to be done that way, but won't oppose if you prefer it to be mentioned in the end.
TBH, I'm not really sure how to deal with citing speeches; I don't think Wikipedia cites MLK in proving that he delivered the I Have a Dream speech. It's obvious though that the speech was rather important in 2025 that someone dug that up and multiple WP:RS reference to it. Howard the Duck (talk) 00:37, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Yes, as I suspected, you are misreading the sources. The Ford Foundation citation is preceded by a secondary source that supports the idea it is discussing (the Sputnik crisis).
Etc. For each primary in the bio, there is usually a secondary supporting the topic. Perhaps if you read it in depth you will discover this for yourself. I’m going offline for a bit now. Viriditas (talk) 00:46, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I'm not disputing that the events didn't happen/were not true; it's just the secondary source should be used (which you had done here) and not the primary source per se. For example, when writing about laws, I do not cite the law per se a reference, but an analysis or annotation of the law. Theae primary sources can go in a "Further reading" section. Howard the Duck (talk) 18:46, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

I'd have no problem with that. Howard the Duck (talk) 03:30, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Giving this a full review. The article was seven days old at the time of the nomination. A QPQ has been done, and I did not find any close paraphrasing. The hook is cited inline, and I am accepting the excerpts. However, I'm not sure if it's really true that it was just him that was able to cut tuition in half, or if there were others involved in the decision as well. That might need to be clarified in the article. In addition, the hook itself is a bit on the weaker side: it might be worth mentioning that the university previously had the highest tuition in the state, but since that is a superlative claim, that would need strong sourcing to prove. Other than that, do you have any other possible hook angles? Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 08:58, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Thanks for taking the review.
As president of the university, Borgmann set their strategic goals and worked with the Board of Trustees to implement his vision of the future of the University of Vermont.
When the hook (and the sources) say that "Carl Borgmann reduced tuition costs for students at the University of Vermont by almost 50 percent", that implies that Borgmann worked as a leader within the administrative structure to promote his goal of reducing tuition.
This means he had to work with the Trustees to do this (which the newspaper sources of the time show), but also with the state government to eventually get the needed funds.
It is likely that the Trustees were instrumental as advisors and worked in the background to help Borgmann reduce the tuition.
Of that, there is no doubt.
But this was Borgmann's strategic vision for UVM. You can go back into the old newspapers of the time and see him personally fighting this battle in the press and in the Senate.
One of the interesting things about this fight, is that Borgmann had to raise tuition several times just to get to the point of reducing it because the funds just weren't there at the beginning. As soon as he became president in 1952, he was pushing for the reduction in tuition.[24] He was arguing that they were paying the highest in-state tuition rates at the time.[25] The previous source even refers to the tuition reduction program as "Borgmann's Financial Plan" from the very beginning.
Another source from 1952 frames the initial proposal as "Borgmann would reduce tuition for Vermonters".[26] That's pretty telling and it shows the consistency of the proposal framed as Borgmann's from its beginning in 1952 until the state finally appropriated the money in mid-1955 (March or thereabouts).
This goes on for several years.
The same campaign by Borgmann is waged in 1953.[27]
By January 1955, you can see the aggressive pressure begin to mount on the state legislature to fund a UVM appropriations bill.
Borgmann is described as "pleading" his case.[28]
After Borgmann receives approval for his plan in March,[29] he once again reiterates how the money is being used to reduce tuition.[30] This is all Borgmann.
Even with the battle won, Borgmann is still speaking out in favor of the benefits of low tuition in 1956.[31] Same thing in 1957.[32] The entire campaign to reduce tuition by getting the state to fund the university is attributed to the efforts of Borgmann and he keeps fighting the battle after winning it.
This is all him.
This secondary source by journalist and author Tom Slayton explains the history in some depth. I am convinced that this is the strongest hook from the article. I am of course willing to consider others.
But to address your points: "I'm not sure if it's really true that it was just him that was able to cut tuition in half, or if there were others involved in the decision as well". Well, it's really true.
He brought the idea of reducing tuition to UVM as president.
He campaigned for his proposal from 1952 until 1955, and even after winning, continued to defend it until he announced his resignation in 1957.
The lowered tuition rates were confirmed in 1956[33][34] and can easily be compared to the earlier sources in 1952 up above and elsewhere. In case it isn't at all clear, it was the passage of the state appropriations bill that allowed Borgmann to reduce in-state tuition.[35] Also, this is covered by the cited secondary sources in some depth. Viriditas (talk) 23:47, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Narutolovehinata5 has expressed displeasure with the ambiguity of the wording, so I am offering ALT0a as a way to clear that up:
ALT0a: ... that Carl Borgmann led a successful campaign to cut in-state tuition at UVM by almost half?
I'm almost okay with that, but I still wonder if the "highest tuition" thing could be mentioned in the hook, given that particular context is important, but given how it would be tricky to prove for sure, I'm okay with it not being mentioned. I would, however, prefer "UVM" to be spelled out in full as "University of Vermont" as most readers will not get the abbreviation.

This is not a review, but perhaps the greater concern here for DYK purposes is if it really is the "first Chinese literary magazine for women". That is a "first" hook, and per WP:DYKHOOKCITE, such superlative claims require exceptional sourcing (and ideally a search for possible counterexamples), since ERRORS might throw a fit if it turns out to be false.

The article is new enough, long enough, and free from close paraphrasing. The nominator provided a complete QPQ. The hooks are all cited inline and verified. Among the proposed hooks, the best hook is probably ALT2; however, I am not sure if it meets DYKFICTION as it is technically talking about an in-universe event, even if it is not plot-related. I will ask for advice regarding this over at WT:DYK. The original hook is rather vague, while ALT1 as currently written may not meet DYKINT since readers may not know who Balanchine is.

As the GA nominator, thank you. Frequently forget to go DYK noms in the required time frame. Personally would remove one of the commas from the first proposal ("...that when Aline Sitoe Diatta's death was announced forty years after she died, she was declared...")

said resistance?" But otherwise am quite happy with these. Not a formal review, though. Spookyaki (talk) 18:19, 8 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

@Icepinner: I see that Bukit Batok MRT station is currently being reviewed at GA. What hooks were you thinking of?--Launchballer 10:36, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Launchballer: Well, I was probably thinking of something like:
ALT0a: ...that Bukit Gombak and Bukit Batok stations' roof
were described by The Straits Times to have an inverted V-shaped roof, reminiscent of the Housing and Development Board logo?
ALT1a: ... that Bukit Gombak and Bukit Batok stations' roof were described by The Straits Times to be reminiscent of the Housing and Development Board (HDB) logo, as they are located in HDB estates?
ALT0a would probably be more interesting, though the addition of Bukit Batok in both hooks would result in removing the images, which is something I'm okay with. If one of them passed for DYK, then the other wouldn't have a chance at DYK, so that's why I'm suggesting a double nom. Icepinner 11:15, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

The article meets the newness and length requirements. I did not find any close paraphrasing. A full QPQ has been completed. The hooks are cited inline and verified in the sources; admittedly, the article uses a referencing that is atypical from what I am used to, but that is not an issue for DYK purposes.
My preferences are ALT1 and ALT2, but they both cannot be approved as currently written: ALT1 could be reworded to make it "hookier" or "exciting", if you know what I mean (i.e. the searching for the rum tunnel could be reworded somewhat). ALT2 is technically correct according to the source, but also inaccurate and also not directly stated in the article. The article does not exactly say that the demolition was "announced to attract potential buyers", at least not directly. It might be better to reword the hook as saying that, to attract buyers, they put out a notice claiming it would be demolished (even though they had no plans of doing so, and could not do it anyway). It would be more accurate to the source too. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 05:54, 5 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hi Narutolovehinata5. As much as I'd love to paint a picture of him crawling on his hands and knees searching a dusty old cellar for a tunnel, the source doesn't support it. It simply says that he spent hours searching for the rumoured tunnel with his sister and friends. As for ALT2, omitting context while still reflecting the source is a common practice in writing hooks, and adding that it was impossible for them to legally demolish the structure actually detracts the hookiness (which is strange, given your concerns about ALT1). The fact that this video was meant to attract buyers is already clear from its the phrase "one video", which links the hook sentence with the previous one, and the video is also mentioned (in less detail) in that sentence's source which makes the collocation clear.
To put it bluntly, I'm done with peopling for now, so I'll withdraw this nomination.  — Chris Woodrich (talk) 10:52, 5 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Crisco 1492: Well, I did not mean to say that the "they aren't allowed to demolish it" fact should be included in ALT2, but rather that it should just be rephrased to make it a bit more obvious that demolishing was never actually on the cards. Something like "to attract buyers, X claimed that the Devonshire Lodge would be demolished?" Not that exact wording, of course, but moreso the thought.

@BeanieFan11: The article has recently been expanded 5x and is free of copyright violations and neutral. The hook is interesting. However, there is a minor issue with the in-text citation. On the sentence Despite weighing 20 kilograms (44 lb) less than Sakho, Diouf defeated him in freestyle wrestling; Diouf won several years later in a rematch under Senegalese wrestling rules did not mention his opponent's bodyweight difference. Please cite the source that stipulates the weight difference at the end of that sentence. Once you're done, the hook is approved. Faldi00 (talk) 17:30, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Looks like it was the Le Soleil reference that mentioned the weight difference (His career is also marked by his legendary confrontation with Double Less, nicknamed the "Giant of Malifara."

Comment: I recently created the articles about Vickers on de.wikipedia and en.wikipedia, and learned that he is a specialist in Italian operas, who ironically sang Bizet's French opera Carmen as his first opera in Europe, in Italy of all places. His first performance in Germany was also in French, in Offenbach's Les contes d'Hoffmann, but I thought that singing French in Italy would be a better hook, without mentioning the second time that happened. (He actually did sing in Italian in Italy just days after his debut in French!)

Looks good; this is a neat article (I'm a fan of unusual tugs too). I didn't notice in the article, but it could be neat if you can find a source that explains why it looks visually bigger than what people may think of in terms of tugboats? Was it because of the (I'm guessing) larger size footprint needed for the steamworks apparatus?

@Narutolovehinata5: I'm sorry, apologies--I've been going through the items on each. It's long enough (seeing 2360 characters); definitely new enough, no copyvios, page/structure/NPOV looks fine; free image. As a boat/air nerd it's definitely an interesting hook. 112 word hook, Earwig says 3.8%. I didn't realize it had to be spelled out thus, my apologies. I know I was asking about the boat article vs the ironworks (I couldn't resist, I love old timey ships), if it made it look like I half assed it.
— Very Polite Person (talk/contribs) 22:50, 5 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Very Polite Person: Thanks for the review! You're assumption about the size of the tug being related to the steamworks apparatus seems reasonable. After reading through the NRHP document more carefully, it doesn't seem to mention anything about the ship being unusually large. When I searched for images of "paddle tugs" on Google, I did find a few pictures of vessels that looked smaller though. I don't think I can give you a better answer right now, unfortunately. I only came across the article on the Portland after researching Northwest Marine Iron Works, so I don't have much info about vessels of that type on hand.

Comment: If the first hook is too close to containing weasal words, then the alt hook would be acceptable (still prefer the main hook as it is more closely tied to article subject), but the source cited uses the same language so I think it is fine. Chandelle does exist as an article but it is almost completely uncited so I didn't include it in the hook.

@Daniel Case: Not a review, but I recommend resolving the {{excessive detail}} tag placed by @AirshipJungleman29:.

@Launchballer:Well, since they said they "don't have time or energy to fix everything" after removing 6-7K or so, it doesn't look like they have any interest in coming back. and, really, what's the point of going to that length to fix a problem and only afterwards leaving a tag describing the problem? I sure wouldn't do that sort of thing ... it's like adding a whole bunch of sources to an article largely lacking in them, and only then putting {{refimprove}} on the article or section. At the very least leave something on the talk page about some further changes that might be made on the talk page. As it is it's very drive-by ... why identify a problem if you're not willing to fix it or even say how?Given my experience reviewing ANEW reports, I am averse to removing such tags when I am the one who did the most work on the article, but here I am hard put to see any other alternative.The date suggestion is interesting and, of course, amenable to me.

... that the size of the entrance hall at the British legation in Uruguay was increased after a diplomat complained there was not enough room to hold dances?
Source: "hey jumped the gun, however, and sent to London their own sketch plan in February 1924. Its areas were 25% greater than Simpson’s schedule and London suggested changes. These did not much appeal to the minister, Claude Mallet, who suggested his own alterations, writing to the Secretary at the Office of Works, Lionel Earle, that ‘The entrance hall is not large enough.
The form of entertainment most followed here are afternoon dances.
‘Halls’ are used for this purpose so as to avoid upsetting the drawing room by the removal of the furniture each time there is a dance.
Space for dancing in the hall for at least 50 couples should be allowed.’
... Cloux and Reavell managed to push the hall area up from 500 to 660 square metres and the drawing room from 540 to 620 square metres." from: Bertram, Mark. "Uruguay: Montevideo". Room for Diplomacy. Retrieved 14 September 2025.

Special occasion holding area[edit]
See also: WP:SOHA
The holding area is near the top of the Approved page. Please only place approved templates there; do not place them below.
Do not nominate articles in this section—nominate all articles in the nominations section above, under the date on which the article was created or moved to mainspace, or the expansion began; indicate in the nomination any request for a specially timed appearance on the main page.
Note: Articles intended to be held for special occasion dates should be nominated within seven days of creations from the start of expansion, or promotion to Good Article status. The nomination should be made at least one week prior to the occasion date, to allow time for reviews and promotions through the prep and queue sets, but not more than six weeks in advance. The proposed occasion must be deemed sufficiently special by reviewers. The timeline limitations, including the six week maximum, may be waived by consensus, if a request is made at WT:DYK, but requests are not always successful. Discussion clarifying the hold criteria can be found here: Hold criteria; discussion setting the six week limit can be found here: Six week limit.
April Fools' Day hooks are exempted from the timeline limit; see Wikipedia:April Fool's Main Page/Did You Know.
