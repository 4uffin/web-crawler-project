Pseudoright[edit]
Hello teahouse. I had someone put my name in the "removals" potential tab related to the "Redirect autopatrol list" nearly 24 days ago now. I followed up once about it, but even that follow up was 8 days ago! No reply. I am hoping to not actually have my name removed from that list, as I do enjoy making redirects, but it has been a minor stress or annoyance to have it still just floating in there for so long. I don't want to do anything inappropriate, and would like to go through the proper channels. Is there any way I can bring attention to that to get it resolved soon hopefully? Iljhgtn (talk) 15:39, 6 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Not getting a response is really worrisome as a newcomer. I have been creating some topics on the talk pages of certain articles, but until I don't tag somebody (which I don't like to), I feel like I'm talk into the void.
I wonder if there have been any technical feature requests for the veteran contributors for tracking the talk pages of a section of articles they specialise in. 182.48.219.237 (talk) 13:24, 9 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

My request to retain the pseudoright and have the drive-by "Removals" mentioned closed out has been pending now for over 27 days. Iljhgtn (talk) 13:38, 9 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Sorry, I didn't want to make it feel like I'm complaining. I just feel that perhaps even the volunteers would find it more convenient to address talk page topics that way.
Apologies for not being clear enough. 182.48.219.237 (talk) 14:22, 9 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

What are the three best sources for it that you know of? 126.34.42.88 (talk) 06:58, 8 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The company pays a marketing agency, and the agency pays you. Therefore you're a paid contributor. So it's not surprising that your drafts are deleted as promotional. (Anyone who thinks my comment is harsh should examine your talk page.) 126.34.42.88 (talk) 07:32, 8 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Sayandutta29031995, I am an administrator so I can read deleted drafts. You claim that you are not here for promotional reasons and yet you submitted this drivel: Founded with a mission to transform the world of diamonds, Lucira is your go‑to destination for lab‑grown jewelry. Please never submit anything like that again to a neutral encyclopedia. Cullen328 (talk) 08:49, 8 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Hello, @007Sayan, and welcome to the Teahouse.
Wikipedia has little interest in what the subject of an article says or wants to say about themselves, or what their associates say about them. Wikipedia is almost exclusively interested in what people who have no connection with the subject, and who have not been prompted or fed information on behalf of the subject, have chosen to publish about the subject in reliable sources. If enough material is cited from independent sources to establish notability, a limited amount of uncontroversial factual information may be added from non-independent sources. ColinFine (talk) 10:48, 8 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Advice around notability[edit]
Hi wikipedia I've been working on
Draft:Australasian Student Architecture Congress, after attending one last year (2024) and being surprised by the lack of a wikipedia entry. It's my first wikipedia article, and I've learnt a lot about encyclopedic tone, wiki text, formatting and so on. Personally feeling it is a notable topic, it's frustrating to receive a second decline due to notability. I have provided four secondary, independent references. Suggestions? Oliver.ophb (talk) 09:40, 8 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Do those sources show significant coverage? Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 13:56, 8 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
All of the secondary sources referenced cover the topic in at least 2 paragraphs, each referencing a number of other, mostly primary research. One is a conference paper entirely on the subject. I have referenced also a number of primary sources entirely on the subject, mostly media. All are independent, reputable outlets. Oliver.ophb (talk) 00:13, 9 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I had referenced more primary sources, but I have removed these in recent edits to improve independence of the subject, as although useful for factual information the removed references read as event listings. The remaining media references are reviews or other independent material. Oliver.ophb (talk) 00:17, 9 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Review thinks LLM, but it's all me baby...[edit]
Just submitted my first page for review and it was rejected with feedback saying it sounds like it was written by a LLM... I am a writer (copywriter) by profession and am reasonably well versed in SEO and AI seach-ability... I have in fact worked on training AI models myself. I can see a few points on my draft where my marketing hat has perhaps slipped back on and sound somewhat promotional, and I will of course edit these back out, but what am I to do about the fact my writing has flagged something that is incorrectly labelling it as AI? I'm wondering if the fact I have written webpage copy for the subject matter of my article might be part of the problem? Looking for advise as I try to 'up' my skillset around wiki-publishing! TIA
Df2025 (talk) 16:07, 8 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Comment If you have a material connection to the topic of the article (such as being employed by them as a marketer) you should not actually be making a Wikipedia page about them at all. I would suggest you have a look at WP:COI that details expectations. This makes the question of (mis)identification as AI somewhat moot. Simonm223 (talk) 16:10, 8 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I did declare a conflict of interest - I'm wanting to up my skillset and have been working on wiki as a pet project. I chose my company as it's something I knew I could write about in detail and accurately (which I also believe is important for trying to get a article, once you've declare a conflict of interest, published). Df2025 (talk) 08:29, 9 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Is this this is about Draft:Dealfront? It says it's about a "pipeline generation platform ... that provides sales intelligence and go-to-market solutions". Those are all good buzzwords, but they don't convey much meaning. Maproom (talk) 16:44, 8 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
That's good to know - I suppose for those who work in sales this would carry more meaning, but I"ll try make the language more universal. thanks! Df2025 (talk) 08:31, 9 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hello, @Df2025, and welcome to the Teahouse.
My first impression looking at Draft:Dealfront is that it looks like what LLM's often produce when they are told to produce Wikipedia articles. Running it through GPTZero, it says "We are highly confident this text is a mix of AI and human". It goes on to give a probability breakdown "5% AI generated; 95% Mixed; 0% Human"
This is not disputing what you say, but showing that the reviewer's response was not unreasonable.
What I will say is that your draft is not written in a way appropriate to Wikipedia.
It reads as what the company wants people to know about them; but that is not what a Wikipedia article should be. It contains non-neutral wording such as "Echobot's deep expertise" - such evaluative language should never occur in a Wikipedia article unless it is a direct quotation from a cited independent source.
One of the reasons why the already difficult task for new editors of writing a Wikipedia article is even harder with a conflict of interest is that once you have assembled the essential reliable independent secondary sources (see WP:42), you effectively have to forget everything you know about the subject, and write a summary of what those sources say (even if you disagree with what they say).
My earnest advice to new editors is to not even think about
trying to create an article until you have spent several weeks - at least - learning about how Wikipedia works by making improvements to existing articles. Once you have understood core policies such as verifiability, neutral point of view, reliable, independent sources, and notability, and experienced how we handle disagreements with other editors (the Bold, Revert, Discuss cycle), then you might be ready to read your first article carefully, and try creating a draft. If you don't follow this advice but try to create an article without this preparation, you are likely to have a frustrating and disappointing experience with Wikipedia. ColinFine (talk) 16:52, 8 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hey, thanks for the feedback and really insightful advice, I appreciate you taking the time.
I have spent the last 4/5 weeks reading more wiki pages (than ever!) and thought I was pretty well prepped, but the things you highlight have obviously shown that my preparation could have done with a little more! I will take a few more weeks to do some more reading and editing, and will attempt a re-write considering all these things... we'll see how I get on then! As a writer, I love the challenge of being able to put on different 'hats' in my writing style, but the wiki hat is a very new one to me! Thanks for all the advice : Df2025 (talk) 08:36, 9 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Df2025 Good on you for looking at this as a learning exercise. As a professional writer you'll know that tone and style need to be appropriate to the context and purpose of your writing. Writing for a general-purpose encyclopaedia is different from writing for a newspaper, scientific journal, blog, or promotional copy. I'd go so far as to say that the neutral, impartial, and yes, sometimes dull tone of an encyclopaedia is the antithesis of promoting copywriting. In addition, large language models have been trained on a lot of material that's gone through SEO and marketing departments. Draft reviewers have already been overburdened by blatantly promotional drafts, and can be understandably too quick to decline new drafts with the LLM reason. Even if it's been written by humans, many of these drafts look like the marketing copy that we definitely don't want here.
If you want to embrace the challenge of learning to write in encyclopaedic style, I have a couple of suggestions. Look for existing articles on subjects that are not from your industry, and learn by making small improvements instead of trying ti write a while article from scratch. If you're working in subjects that are not related to your profession, it might be easier for you to put on your encyclopaedic "hat". And if you haven’t already, spend some time reading our Manual of Style and guide to writing better articles, and in particular: Wikipedia:Writing better articles § Tone and Wikipedia:Neutral point of view § Impartial tone. ClaudineChionh (she/her · talk · email · global) 10:37, 9 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Great advice, thank you - I'm trying to build up my editing skills and have deliberately seleected topics that are the opposite end of the scale to work for me! I'll absolutely keep going with that for the mean time. I'm keen to learn and keep developing so really appreciate you taking the time to point me in the right direction - thank you! Df2025 (talk) 08:53, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Wikipedia has a lot of policy articles that people usually don't see until they do something wrong. IMO the best way to learn what not to do on Wikipedia is by reading the various policies that are linked to editors here on the Teahouse or WP:Helpdesk mgjertson (talk) (contribs) 19:46, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Draft feedback, newbie[edit]
Hi, I am a new Wikipedia contributor (this is only my second page creation). I’ve been working on a draft here: User:SueRostvold/De Lewellen.
I’ve gathered a ton of references, and I’d appreciate feedback on whether my draft looks neutral in tone, and if my citations and formatting are on the right track before I submit it.
Any and all feedback appreciated. (I can take it.) ;)
Thanks so much for your help!
SueRostvold (talk) 17:17, 8 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@SueRostvold Take a look at WP:Named references for how to re-use some citations that you currently have repeated multiple times (e.g. to "Punk in Austin"). I suggest you move your draft to Draft:De Lewellen and then submit it for a formal review as described at WP:Articles for creation. Mike Turnbull (talk) 17:32, 8 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Okay. I will do that before I submit. Thanks. SueRostvold (talk) 18:02, 8 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Regarding the multiple references Mike, yes I knew it looked bad. But while working on the page it was helping me keep everything straight. But my plan was to fix before submitting. Thanks again for your input. SueRostvold (talk) 21:23, 8 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@SueRostvold Welcome to the Teahouse. I made a small tweak to your draft. If you like, you can move it to the Draft namespace yourself, or I can do it for you. After that, you can submit for AFC review.ThilioR O B O T🤖 talk 17:46, 8 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hello, SueRostvold. Your draft had those irritating ** double asterisks scattered through it. They have since been removed and replaced by inappropriate use of italics. Those are indicative of content cranked out by Artificial Intelligence robots that are prone to hallucinations and falsification. We want content on Wikipedia that is written and verified by living, breathing human beings. Please read Wikipedia:Artificial intelligence for guidance. Cullen328 (talk) 17:47, 8 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hi Cullen328. Understood. Noted. I have found chatgpt useful in hunting sources for me. (That is allowed right?) I have done my best to verify all links before using. I will read the article you suggested for guidance. Thanks for pointing me in that direction. So much to learn. SueRostvold (talk) 18:05, 8 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I am not quite ready for AFC review. But thanks. Let me get back to you on this. I need to learn how to do some stuff myself. Thank you for your time. Appreciate it. SueRostvold (talk) 18:03, 8 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hi Thilio, thank you for the tweak. I appreciate you time. It I accidentally undo what you do, I apologize. I was going to work on cleaning up my links. I often work outside of wikipedia and then transfer to my draft. So if you changed, added or removed something and I don't know what, I might undo it accidentally. Hope I'm making sense. Thoughts on this? I went to history to try to see what you did but couldn't figure it out. - I know just enough to be dangerous on Wikipedia I guess. My goal is to not piss anyone off and follow the rules. Try not to get blocked again because I forgot a colon in my draft categories. Wish me luck. :) SueRostvold (talk) 18:15, 8 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
launching a webpage[edit]
Can I submit a wikipedia page for a nonprofit organization if I am on the board? Roadbackfound (talk) 20:08, 8 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Check is it actually notable enough for Wikipedia. Also remember about NPOV. Brickguy276 (talk) 20:10, 8 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
For notability, see WP:Notability (organizations and companies). "NPOV" stands for "neutral point of view", meaning neutrality. See WP:NPOV. Notability and neutrality are important issues, but you'd face more besides. First, read and digest WP:Plain and simple conflict of interest guide, and the pages relevant to you to which it links, in particular WP:Paid-contribution disclosure. Secondly, the question above is your sole contribution (or anyway your sole contribution as "Roadbackfound") to Wikipedia so far. You'd be wise to acquire and hone your Wikipedia editing/augmenting skills by working on existing articles before launching a draft for a new article. -- Hoary (talk) 22:15, 8 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hello, @Roadbackfound, and welcome to the Teahouse and to Wikipedia.
In addition to Brickguy's and Hoary's advice, I would point out that editing with a conflict of interest is permitted, but there are certain recommendations for how to proceed (see that link).
I also suggest that you stop thinking "a Wikipedia page for" your organization, and substitute "an encyclopaedia article about" it. This may seem nitpicky, but I think it will help you remember that such an article would not belong to your organization, would not be controlled by your organization, and would not necessarily say what you wanted it to say. See an article about yourself isn't necessarily a good thing.
Wikipedia has little interest in what the subject of an article says or wants to say about themselves, or what their associates say about them. Wikipedia is almost exclusively interested in what people who have no connection with the subject, and who have not been prompted or fed information on behalf of the subject, have chosen to publish about the subject in reliable sources. If enough material is cited from independent sources to establish notability, a limited amount of uncontroversial factual information may be added from non-independent sources.
My earnest advice to new editors is to not even think about
trying to create an article until you have spent several weeks - at least - learning about how Wikipedia works by making improvements to existing articles. Once you have understood core policies such as verifiability, neutral point of view, reliable, independent sources, and notability, and experienced how we handle disagreements with other editors (the Bold, Revert, Discuss cycle), then you might be ready to read your first article carefully, and try creating a draft. If you don't follow this advice but try to create an article without this preparation, you are likely to have a frustrating and disappointing experience with Wikipedia. And that is even without a COI. ColinFine (talk) 10:46, 9 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Colin, All of this is excellent advice thank you!! 2601:644:8580:F810:40F0:15AC:C85A:4012 (talk) 22:20, 9 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
In addition to the wonderful advice from other editors, please remember that subjects don't "own" their page and can't control what goes on it. By the "launching a webpage" wording it seems you intend to use Wikipedia as webhosting. Don't do that mgjertson (talk) (contribs) 19:50, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Accuracy vs resolution[edit]
Courtesy link: Draft talk:UnderstandingAccuracyvsResolution
I have over the years noticed that many people and engineers in particular get confused over how manufacturers state accuracy or what is known as Specsmanship.
I wanted to submit an article that explains this subject and when I submitted it for AfC peer review it was rejected as not aligned with the purpose of wikipedia.
Any thoughts? Edward Denigan (talk) 20:38, 8 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hello and welcome.
Wikipedia is not a place to explain, it's a place to summarize- summarize what independent reliable sources say about a topic.
You wrote a comparison and drew conclusions- that is original research.
If you have sources that discuss this topic and make conclusions, you can write a draft that summarizes what those conclusions are. 331dot (talk) 20:48, 8 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Content written by Forbes contributors is not considered reliable on Wikipedia due to the lack of serious editorial control. Please see WP:FORBESCON for the community consensus. Your third reference is to an interview with Polish. Interviews do not establish notability on Wikipedia because, by definition, they are not independent sources. After checking three references that do not establish notability, I gave up. You should emphasize references to sources that establish notability. These sources must be reliable, they must be independent of the topic, and they must devote significant coverage to the topic. Joe Polish is the topic. Two out of three is not good enough.

Openstreetmap[edit]
Hello. I am a frequent editor of the page Kolkata metro. I added this in the infobox:
{{Rapid transit OSM map
| frame-lat
= 22.5726
| frame-long
= 88.3639
| frame-width
= 300
| frame-height = 450
| zoom
= 11
}}
But the problem is it's not showing the whole map. Like, there is a gap between two sections of green line, orange line is truncated and yellow is not shown. However, when I opened openstreetmap and the relations, it shows all of that. But somehow this do not reflect in wikipedia. (But the proper ones were reflecting in wikipedia some days ago, don't know why it's not reflecting now). Can anyone help? AnkurPl 04:52, 9 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Copyright of Trump letter to Epstein[edit]
I have uploaded Donald Trump letter to Jeffrey Epstein to wikipedia under fair use, for the relevant article.
File:Donald Trump message in Jeffrey Epstein 50th birthday book.png
I am thinking what is the copyright status. (I have not uploaded to Commons, so it's a bit irrelevant, just for... fun I guess.)
I think it's still Donald Trump? But he recently claimed it's not made by him, so it's not his copyright... but that is not a waiver of copyright. Or is it?
(The pages were released by the subcommitee, but that doesn't make them work by government and in PD, right.) - Karel Bílek (talk). 09:45, 9 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Jeffrey Epstein's 50th birthday greeting album says that Ghislaine Maxwell assembled the book, so wouldn't it be her copyright? 331dot (talk) 09:58, 9 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Her copyright would only extend to the composition, i.e. if the image included the book covers or some other creative aspects of the assembly of the book (tbh it's pretty hard to imagine how that would apply). The image copyright belongs to the person who drew the image, and/or composed its text, and/or gave the copyright to someone else. If we don't know who that is, we can't know that they've waived copyright. Fair use is the appropriate claim. -- zzuuzz (talk) 10:14, 9 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
For my own curiosity- does that mean the House subcommittee(or the specific members) violated the copyright? 331dot (talk) 12:55, 9 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Well, according to news sources, the book was "released" by the House committee. They only released it; they did not copy it. If that's the case, then there can be no question of copyright violation. (But that's just my inexpert opinion.) Mike Marchmont (talk) 13:14, 9 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

how to provide sources for a game I love. 50.170.206.18 (talk) 16:15, 9 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hello and welcome to the Teahouse. I fixed your link, the whole url is not needed.
Wikipedia is not a how-to guide or gaming guide. Wikipedia articles summarize what independent reliable sources choose to say about topics that meet our criteria for inclusion.
For games, that is usually shown through citations to reviews written by professional game critics.
If you have no sources, the game would not merit inclusion here.
If you just want to tell the world about this game, you should use social media.
I see that you cite Fandom as a source- you may wish to focus your efforts in improving coverage of the game there. 331dot (talk) 16:23, 9 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

My article on Tayo Fatunla has been rejected for the second time because of notability issues. The revision was substantially different from the original. I endeavored to satisfy notability issues. I also attended to formatting and structural issues. Please take a look at my sources——and, indeed, the article whole article——and enlighten me on what more I might have to do to improve it so as to satisfy Wikipedia's metrics. Thank you. Bolekaja (talk) 19:17, 9 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hello. The draft was declined, not rejected. Rejected has a specific meaning in the draft process, that a draft may not be resubmitted. Declined means that it may be resubmitted. You made no changes after the first decline, this is clear from the edit history.
If you thought you made changes, you didn't. You should not resubmit a draft without addressing the concerns of the reviewer. 331dot (talk) 19:24, 9 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

This creation of yours makes me wonder if you understand that all content must be attributed to reliable sources, independent of Ahmed Makahiil Hussein .

Hello, @Mohamed ahmed qalqale, and welcome to the Teahouse and to Wikipedia.
My earnest advice to new editors is to not even think about
trying to create an article until you have spent several weeks - at least - learning about how Wikipedia works by making improvements to existing articles. Once you have understood core policies such as verifiability, neutral point of view, reliable, independent sources, and notability, and experienced how we handle disagreements with other editors (the Bold, Revert, Discuss cycle), then you might be ready to read your first article carefully, and try creating a draft. If you don't follow this advice but try to create an article without this preparation, you are likely to have a frustrating and disappointing experience with Wikipedia. ColinFine (talk) 09:21, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Reliable or not[edit]
does this source is relaible or not. Mr.work-shy (talk) 01:22, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
That might depend on what it was used as a source for. (It's mostly a collection of photographs, some of which have been doctored ["photoshopped"] very crudely.) What assertions do you hope to attribute to it? -- Hoary (talk) 02:30, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

I need help about edit warring and talk page.[edit]
Hello, I'm a relatively new user. I'm trying to add to the pages as much as I can. I need help with something. I added a paragraph about the history of pastırma to the pastırma page. I've included all the sources. My post appears to be accurate, and all the sources I've added are reliable. However, this paragraph is constantly being deleted by a user. The reasons they offer don't make sense to me, and I'm trying to understand the real reason. It happens like this: I add the paragraph, a user deletes it entirely, and the mods then revert it. Then, another user deletes the paragraph, citing my two-week ban from another page. I refuse and revert it (Does the fact that I was temporarily blocked from another page due to an edit war means that I cannot contribute to another page??). They revert it again and threaten to block me. This process doesn't happen in a day; it's been spread out over about two weeks. I haven't received a warning about this, but I'm wondering if I'm entering an edit war again, as I've reverted my edit three times. What should I do in this situation? I need help. I believe my paragraph complies with all the terms and conditions (if you disagree, please share your opinion). I don't want to get into an edit war and be temporarily blocked from this page. Also, should I start a thread about this on the talk page? If I do, I don't know how to explain it there. Can anyone guide me? Haydi123 (talk) 10:31, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hello. Have you tried communicating with the editors that are reverting you to ask them to elaborate as to the reasons why they are doing so?
Edit warring is not a solution, you are already blocked from one article for edit warring, if you do so more broadly you may be blocked from Wikipedia entirely. Edit summaries that call people a "gang" are a personal attack, please focus on the content. 331dot (talk) 11:06, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hello, thank you for your reply. My question was about whether this was an edit war. Since time had passed, I assumed it wouldn't be, but I received a warning about an edit war. I won't be editing this page for a while; I don't want to break the rules. I used the gang part metaphorically, and I didn't direct it at a single person. Will I have a problem with this? I'll try not to do it again. Thanks for the warning. Haydi123 (talk) 12:13, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

@Haydi123: I would say that you being blocked from another article will not in itself cause you to be blocked from editing Pastirma, but the fact that you have already been blocked somewhere may indicate a certain tendency to get blocked; in other words, you may end up being blocked from Pastirma for the same reason as what got you blocked from Dolma. Also, edit summaries such as "I will continue to add as you delete" suggest that you may be approaching this with a mindset that could well get you into trouble with edit warring. -- DoubleGrazing (talk) 13:50, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Gambling[edit]
Changing National Coalition against Legalized Gambling name to Stop Predatory Gambling. Add info from stop predatory gambling page (merge them both)
I work for Stop Predatory Gambling. Our organization was founded 30 years ago, when it was named the National Coalition against legalized gambling. In 2008, our name changed to Stop Predatory Gambling. I created a page for stop predatory gambling but my editor said it could be merged with the national coalition page. We must have the page renamed to stop predatory gambling and just add our information from 2008 and on to this page. Please let me know if this is possible. Thanks. Caherniv (talk) 14:05, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Caherniv In Wikipedia terms, you are a paid editor and before you do anything else you need to disclose that on your user page, as described at the link. In view of this, you should not be editing the National Coalition Against Legalized Gambling article directly but should make suggestions for changes to it (including a possible move to a new title) on its talk page, perhaps using the edit request wizard to draw attention to your proposals. Note that Wikipedia article titles are based on the name most commonly used in its sources, although if the name changed in 2008, by now the new name should be firmly established.

Considering article rewrite[edit]
Hello,
I'm somewhat new, and I have found an article that I have focusing a lot of attention on: Amino acid dating. I perceive that this article is generally lacking inline citations for quite a few of its claims (one of my first edits was to add {{more footnotes needed}}), and there are also gaps in the article's coverage that are mentioned in sources (for example, the article does not mention kinds of materials that the method is applied to, which according to sources are various kinds of biominerals including eggshell, mollusc shell, bones, and teeth). I also think it is a good candidate to try to get to wp:Good Article status as it is flagged as high importance in multiple wikiprojects. I have also read some essays that suggested a good way to bring an article up to GA is to fully audit its sources yourself and fully or partially rewrite the article (which, done right, forces you to read and understand all the sources, which would also fix the pervasive sourcing issues I perceive).
Therefore, I was thinking that I would go ahead and rewrite the article fully as a way to improve its quality. I have already begun the process of reading through the sources and planning the rewrite on my user page: User:jancabinet/amino acid dating. The article, based on its edit history, doesn't appear to have any other "custodians" at present, and since I began editing it a month ago I haven't been contacted by anyone who might have had the page watchlisted. My question for the people here is if that's enough- rewriting does seem a little dramatic and like it could make some people angry. Have I done my due diligence, or is there yet something I need to take care of before I can rewrite? Jancabinet (talk) 14:05, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Jancabinet On the "due diligence" question, are you familiar with how to get full page statistics, which for that article is Amino acid dating - Page History - XTools? That shows you which other editors might be most likely to be interested in your re-write and you can check whether they are still active and if so maybe get in touch via their talk pages. In general, I encourage you to be bold and go ahead with your changes. Mike Turnbull (talk) 14:22, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Hi Plotlines, welcome to the Teahouse. Most of our documentation is for the source editor. You used VisualEditor which works differently. Somebody fixed it but see Help:VisualEditor#Editing templates for how to add templates with VisualEditor. However, it only works for pages starting with "Template:" like Template:User citizen Kentucky, not User:UBX/NFL-Colts. See the end of Help:VisualEditor#Getting started: the VisualEditor toolbar for how to switch to the source editor where all userboxes can be added regardless of namespace ("Template" or "User" in these examples). PrimeHunter (talk) 16:48, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I don't normally use VisualEditor but found out that you can write User:UBX/NFL-Colts and press enter in the "Search for a template" field.

Hi! I recently made a page for up&coming writer Sebastian Castillo but it isn't showing up on any google results or getting crawled by Google, not even when i search 'sebastian castillo wikipedia.'

You don't. New Pages Patrol is a volunteer driven process, with people doing what they can, when they can. The article will be indexed after 90 days of it has not been reviewed. Do you have a particular need for it to appear in search results quickly? Wikipedia has no control over how fast Google's algorithms work. 331dot (talk) 23:15, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I can't decide whether to nominate it for deletion at WP:AFD or to move it back to draft space for further incubation (for some reason the creator submitted it for review and then moved it to mainspace the same day). It's a WP:BLP-violating article as it is, with many unsourced statements, and junk sources that don't confer notability on the subject.
I would say it isn't ready for mainspace if the subject is notable, and should not be patrolled. ~Anachronist (talk) 00:06, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
criteria for upgrade to class B[edit]
I recently requested a review for International Virtual Aviation Organisation's content assessment level, and it was put as C and a copy editing maintenance banner was added. I've cleaned up the copy editing properly and was wondering if it's suitable for class B, or if it still falls short due to the lack of secondary sources? Unfrotuantley not a ton of secondary sources are available for this topic as it's fairly niche — an issue which also affects VATSIM GeorgeHav (talk) 23:36, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
It's still class C due to cleanup problems, the main one being heavily reliance on primary sources. ~Anachronist (talk) 23:59, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Fair enough. I assume the fact that there isn't really that many secondary sources for this topic isn't justification to allow excusing that? GeorgeHav (talk) 00:16, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@GeorgeHav: Lack of secondary sources suggests that the topic is not notable and is a candidate for deletion, actually. Or, over-reliance on primary sources suggests a violation of our policy on undue weight, which would require cleanup. In any case, a class C article is one that may have cleanup issues, and as long as it has cleanup issues (as indicated by the template) it is class C the way the assessment scale defines it. ~Anachronist (talk) 00:29, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Avoiding edit warring during discussion[edit]
Hello Teahouse, I hope you're all well!
A month ago, I noticed an omission in the history of my town and decided to become a wikipedia editor to correct it. Another editor critiqued my edit and gave some advice, so I adjusted accordingly and republished, but we keep going back and forth with me trying to improve the contribution and then reverting my changes. I opened a discussion on the talk page to reach a resolution. In the meantime, which version of the page should stay up? I don't want to engage in an edit war with repeated undo-ing.
Here is the page in question: Elmira, Ontario. Jbaribeau (talk) 01:09, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The article should remain as it was before you attempted to add the information; the burden is on you to build a case to include it, not for the other editor to justify removing it. 331dot (talk) 08:41, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Jbaribeau Note that we have various established methods of dispute resolution if you and another editor get stuck and can't agree. When I get involved in discussions about niche topics, my first thought is that I'm happy to have found someone else who cares about it! Mike Turnbull (talk) 13:20, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Killing of [victim] Vs Murder of [victim] Vs something else[edit]
I'm a bit confused about when it's appropriate to use certain titles. The flowchart from WP:DEATHS seems pretty straightforward, but I've been following the discussions on the talk pages of Killing of Iryna Zarutska and Shooting of Charlie Kirk, and things don't quite add up for me.
According to WP:MURDEROF, it says:
"Where reliable sources establish that a murder occurred, an article may be titled 'Murder of [Victim]' even if no suspect is identified or prosecuted."
But doesn't that directly contradict WP:DEATHS, which suggests the title should only include "murder" if someone has actually been convicted? Emac07 (talk) 01:16, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Both WP:MURDEROF and WP:MURDERS are essays, not policy(though MURDERS says it is an explanation of policy).
Murder is a legal conclusion, which is why it's best to wait for a court of law to convict someone(to be consistent with WP:BLP).
I'm not aware of a circumstance where a killing was identified as a murder without a suspect being named or convicted. 331dot (talk) 08:40, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
There are a few articles titled "Murder of [Victim]" where no suspect has been identified or convicted. For example, see Murder of Elsie Frost, Murder of Jane Thurgood-Dove, and Murder of Lyn Bryant. The article Murder of Arlene Arkinson is also titled as such, even though in the case no body has ever been found and no one has been convicted. I could provide many more examples.

Bashundhara Kings Ultras[edit]
During my newcomer copyediting suggestions, I came across this page: Bashundhara Kings Ultras. It has already been declared as WP:PUFFERY by a previous editor, but I am wondering whether this article should be nominated for deletion.
Half of the sources on the page point to Facebook pages. The
Members section seems unnecessary.
I am not fully well-versed with the WP:Notability and WP:Relevance policies, hence wanted a more seasoned editor to take a look at the page and, preferably, suggest me a course of action.

Request for Feedback on Draft - Sunbet[edit]
Hello,
I’m a new editor on Wikipedia, and I recently created an article titled SunBet. I would greatly appreciate it if experienced editors could review it and provide feedback on the content, sources, structure, and style.
I’m especially looking for guidance on:
Whether the article meets Wikipedia’s notability guidelines
Suggestions for improving citations and references
Advice on improving clarity, neutrality, and overall readability
Any constructive feedback would be very helpful. Thank you in advance for your time and guidance! TuisVV (talk) 10:54, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hello, @TuisVV, and welcome to the Teahouse.
Thank you for disclosing your status as a paid editor.
I have added a header to allow you to submit Draft:Sunbet for review, which is the way to get feedback.
However, I advise you not to submit it at present, because it will certainly be declined.
The problem is that you have done what most beginners do when they try the new and unfamiliar task of creating a Wikipedia article: you have written it backwards, and cited not relevant sources.
A Wikipedia article should be a summary of what several people wholly unconnected with the subject have separately chosen to publish about the subject in reliable publications, and little else.
Writing it begins with finding sources that are reliable, independent, and containing significant coverage of the subject (see WP:42). It then continues (assuming that you have found such sources) by setting aside anything that you know about the subject, and writing a summary of what those independent sources say. (Do you see why writing with a conflict of interest is even harder than writing an article in the first place?)
Wikipedia has little interest in what the subject of an article says or wants to say about themselves, or what their associates say about them. Wikipedia is almost exclusively interested in what people who have no connection with the subject, and who have not been prompted or fed information on behalf of the subject, have chosen to publish about the subject in reliable sources. If enough material is cited from independent sources to establish notability, a limited amount of uncontroversial factual information may be added from non-independent sources.
My earnest advice to new editors is to not even think about
trying to create an article until you have spent several weeks - at least - learning about how Wikipedia works by making improvements to existing articles. Once you have understood core policies such as verifiability, neutral point of view, reliable, independent sources, and notability, and experienced how we handle disagreements with other editors (the Bold, Revert, Discuss cycle), then you might be ready to read your first article carefully, and try creating a draft. If you don't follow this advice but try to create an article without this preparation, you are likely to have a frustrating and disappointing experience with Wikipedia.

Scottish fashion designers[edit]
I’m a student studying journalism and I’m interested in the Scottish fashion designers and would like to know the author who wrote or edited the article because I have Wikipedia as my source. 192.124.203.102 (talk) 10:57, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Welcome to the Teahouse. All articles have a "view history" tab where the whole development of the current text can be seen, with the names of the individual editors, which of course are usually pseudonyms. For large articles, it is usually better to see an overview of authorship which can be obtained from the history tab by clicking on the "page statistics" link near the top. See WP:REUSE for licensing considerations if you want to re-use Wikipedia material: you don't have to acknowledge individual authors. Mike Turnbull (talk) 11:38, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
IP OP, for an example of what Mike Turnbull means by you don't have to acknowledge individual authors, you can:
go to Special:CiteThisPage/Pam Hogg,
hit the blue "submit" button
scroll down to see the citation style your class requires
An example in Chicago style: Wikipedia contributors, "Pam Hogg,"  Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pam_Hogg&oldid=1303005605 (accessed September 11, 2025).

If your question relates to citing Wikipedia in a student assignment, you need to realise that Wikipedia, being an encyclopaedia, is a tertiary source and might not be allowed as a citation at all.

Did you use an AI to make this chart? It’s hard to understand the reasoning. Inc42 has a disclaimer about its own poor reliability, and the Hindustan Times article is mostly all quotes from Ratnaparkhe and so not independent. If these are the strongest sources, the topic is likely not notable enough for an article. -- NotCharizard 🗨 11:20, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hello, @VerifiableVoice, and welcome to the Teahouse. You have a common misunderstanding about what Wikipedia means by independence. It does not mean "This comes from a publication generally regarded as indpendent".
"Independent" means, roughly, "The subject of the article had no involvement at all in the particular article or piece being cited" - they (and their associates or organisations) did not write, edit, publish, vet, or commission the piece, and it is not based on their words whether in an interview, press-release, profile, or otherwise.

River titles[edit]
Hi, I have a question regarding the title of a river. This is in reference to Kirtankhola River, which was recently renamed from simply "Kirtankhola". My understanding is that since there is no other page with the simple title "Kirtankhola", there is no need to add "River" to the title, as a form of disambiguation. The user who has made this change, however, contends that this fits the naming convention for rivers in Bangladesh. Please advise. Revirvlkodlaku (talk) 12:55, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
In my opinion the relevant policy is WP:COMMONNAME; the title should be whatever most reliable sources use to refer to this body of water. If that's not clear, editors should discuss the matter on the talk page to achieve a consensus. The official or legal name is important, but not the deciding factor. 331dot (talk) 14:12, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Issue with Hyperlinks Not Displaying as Blue in References Section[edit]
I have a problem in my Word document where only the first hyperlink in the references section turns blue, but the last two do not, despite being properly inserted. I've verified the links via right-click > Edit Hyperlink, and no unusual styles are applied.
A quick fix I found online is to close and reopen the document, which resets the hyperlink styles to default blue for unvisited links. If that doesn't work, I can try right-clicking each non-blue link, selecting "Edit Hyperlink," and clicking OK to reapply the style. Alternatively, modifying the "FollowedHyperlink" style color to match "Hyperlink" (blue) could prevent this permanently.
Could you confirm if these steps resolve it or suggest further troubleshooting?
Thank you! CoolEditer25 (talk) 17:50, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

To clarify, in my Wikipedia article's references section, the first external link renders as blue (unvisited), but the last two appear as black text despite being properly formatted as
[... ...] {{cite web}}: Check |url= value (help); Missing or empty |title= (help). I've checked the wikitext for errors, and preview shows the same issue.

My earnest advice to new editors is to not even think about

Hello Kirbyfeet10. When I first became an editor I was sure I'd never attempt to write a Wikipedia article because I grew up with a high regard for encyclopedias, and felt I wasn't experienced enough to write for one. But three years later I was annoyed that no one had written an article on a certain children's book series, and decided to attempt it. I studied articles on other book series, read Help:Your first article so many times I practically memorized it, spent weeks hunting down good references, wrote and rewrote my article, submitted for review, and it was accepted. Even though I'd done some freelance writing creating an article was a difficult, but not impossible, task. My advice is to start out improving existing articles on subjects that interest you and, if you later want to attempt an article, take it slow, study Help:Your first article, gather your references first to make sure there's enough published info to start writing, submit your draft article and patiently wait for a review. Best wishes on future Wikipedia projects. Karenthewriter (talk) 03:01, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Hello, Babin Mew. What you are describing is not appropriate.

replacing photo[edit]
Comments to me included the fact that the photo of the subject in the biography was no good. I want to replace it now with a good one but I can't figure out how to delete the bad one.Draft:Morris Miller. Equusreserve (talk) 07:03, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hi Equusreserve. Is the new photo still in a PDF file? An image format like PNG or JPG would be better. It affects what should be done with the PDF version. PrimeHunter (talk) 09:16, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
the new photo is PDF and I'll change it to PNG ort JPG if necessary, but my problem is how to delete the old bad photo which is a word thumbnail and was one of the reasons my article wasn't accepted. How to delete it? thanks. Equusreserve (talk) 06:49, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Where did you find that image? Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 12:24, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
the image I want to use is a photo I've taken of the original photo. High quality. but again, that's not the problem. How to delete the old bad one? Equusreserve (talk) 06:50, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
can I click 'talk to andy" and have a direct exchange with you on email or whatever? Equusreserve (talk) 06:51, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
That's a link to my talk page (see WP:Talk pages).
You can email me via the link on my user page; but only do so, please, if it's a matter that for some good reason can't be discussed on my talk page.
But my question was: where did you find the original photo? Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 10:14, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
it was from an old photo that had several other in it. I cropped it down to just his head, saved it on word and uploaded it. Equusreserve (talk) 15:23, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Equusreserve Andy's question was where you obtained the original photo. If it came, for example, from some website then you do not own the copyright and your derivative work may not be used on Wikipedia except under our fair use provisions, which we do allow for images of deceased individuals. Even then, the image may only be added to live articles, not drafts. Also, you seem to have uploaded your citations to a proquest account but for a judge like Miller I would expect most of the underlying material to be from contemporary newspapers. It would be much better to use the {{cite news}} template giving details of the authors and the newspaper title, publication date etc. You do not have to provide working links to copies of the actual newspapers. For example.[1] Mike Turnbull (talk) 15:37, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Thanks to both of you. This ain't easy for an old guy but I think I now have the sources right. Please check.
Still not clear how to delete the one picture and then add the new one.
The one I want to delete was my cropped version of an old photo.
The original of that had several other people in it so I cropped it to just the head.
And then it turned out to be a very small image. Even if I could fix that, I'd much rather use a new much better one that I've found.
Is there some way for this system to alert me when I get a message from you two or any other editor? Right now, I go to this page to see if there's any feedback, but if I didn't return to it on my own, I'd never know. Equusreserve (talk) 08:03, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Equusreserve -- and (if I remember to sign this message) I have thereby alerted you that there's a message from me, mentioning you (and possibly addressed to you) -- Yann "deleted page File:Morris Miller.pdf (Copyright violation: Miller died in 1970. This is not a 2025 image and likely not own work.)" The replacement that you hope to add in place of Morris Miller.pdf: Who owns its copyright? -- Hoary (talk) 09:10, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
As a family member (as you know), the photo is in my possession so I own the copyright. I've uploaded the photo for you but not here obviously.
Rather, it's somehow available to you elsewhere... Equusreserve (talk) 11:39, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
"the photo is in my possession so I own the copyright"—That is a non sequitur; ownership of a copy (or even a negative) does not in itself confer copyright.
"somehow available to you elsewhere"—Please don't post riddles. Act in good faith, or not at all. Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 12:49, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Disappearance of Darya Bulba[edit]
Disappearance of Darya Bulba
I feel this article should be a biography of Darya Bulba (a page which doesn't exist) and the Disappearance
should be a section inside it.
I wonder what others think. Kingsacrificer (talk) 07:04, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Three things, Kingsacrificer. (i) She would have to be notable (as defined by and for Wikipedia), and the article would have to demonstrate this. (ii) You'd have to apply for help (at Wikipedia:Requested moves) in order to move the existing article to "Darya Bulba". (iii) Your user page announces: "I am new here. Joined on the September 9, 2025." You'd be wise to get a few weeks' worth of additional experience doing rather more humdrum edits before attempting the kind of thing that you seem to have in mind. -- Hoary (talk) 08:25, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Thank you for your comments, Hoary. It doesn't seem like there's significant independent coverage on Darya Bulba, apart from the disappearance incident. I am guessing this means her notability is not certain.
Appreciate your suggestion for humdrum edits. If there's any areas that you'd suggest I begin with (I feel I have outgrown my Newcomer homepage suggestions), I would be glad to take it up.
Thanks! Kingsacrificer (talk) 08:54, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
You might find something to your taste here Lectonar (talk) 08:55, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Kingsacrificer, recently it feels as if I've spent a lot of time attempting to reinforce a particular article against demotion from FA status. This has been rather a chore -- yet also challenging and enjoyable. Thanks to well-intended but underinformed (or plain lazy) accretions, FAs and GAs do tend to be weakened over time; and our standards for referencing and so forth have risen over the decades; so all in all articles such as "mine" do need periodic attention and improvement. Now look at WP:Featured article review and particularly its section FA removal candidates. Note how many of these are candidates for removal because nobody responded to the criticisms made earlier. And now look at FA reviews and WP:GA reassessment#Articles listed for reassessment. Do you see any article whose subject interests you but doesn't (yet) seem to interest other editors? If so, consider working on this or that aspect of the article. Don't aim to rescue the article single-handedly (unless of course you have a lot of time and energy): even relatively minor help is likely to be worthwhile. -- Hoary (talk) 11:36, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Wow, this is a lot! I went through the 4 links you shared. Although overwhelming, it is certainly an important issue that needs systematic redressal, but I feel ill-equipped at the time to make modifications to potential FA and GA, simply because I'm not fully well-versed with the rules of the game. But you're right, perhaps I can start with minor changes for certain articles.
Thanks again! Kingsacrificer (talk) 16:19, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
OK, Kingsacrificer, but a little correction: these aren't potential "Featured"/"Good" articles; they're instead actual "Featured"/"Good" articles that risk losing their "Featured"/"Good" status. (The one I've been working on "appeared on Wikipedia's Main Page as Today's featured article on April 6, 2007" -- of course before many of today's editors were born -- and its FA status went unquestioned for 18 years.) -- Hoary (talk) 21:35, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Yes, yes. I gathered that. I phrased myself wrong. Kingsacrificer (talk) 21:57, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Zerkaa[edit]
I am planning to improve the Zerkaa article. It will be my first major contribution.
I am worried a bit about sources (still struggling to be WP:BOLD)
Zerkaa is a YouTube personality, who frequently appears in videos and podcasts on his own channel as well as on others' channels. In that case, would it be fine to add facts that he stated in certain videos as part of an article (for example, he mentions his parents' divorce which led to his interest in gaming, on a channel owned by his then girlfriend/now wife)? I am unsure how to interpret WP:BLPSELFPUB, in this case.
All (or most) facts that I plan to add will be non-contentious, so I feel it will be fine to add, but I thought it will be best to ask here first. Also, am I required to make major changes to Sandbox and not on the page directly?
Thanks for your assistance. Kingsacrificer (talk) 07:23, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Kingsacrificer Per for example WP:ABOUTSELF and WP:PROPORTION, what he has to say about himself is mostly not interesting from the WP-pov, that's what his social media is for. The goal of the WP-article about him is to summarize independent WP:RS about him. Gråbergs Gråa Sång (talk) 09:50, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Policies Help[edit]
Hey teahouse, I'm new to Wikipedia editing, and I'm a little nervous to start contributing. I plan to be an editor after I graduate university; I'm confident in my skills but worried that I'll violate a policy I was unaware of! There's so many shortcuts that I have trouble keeping track. Can someone please summarize major policies I need to be aware of and how to type the shortcuts? Much appreciated! Chuumechuuya (talk) 15:29, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hi @Chuumechuuya, and welcome! What you're looking for might be something like Wikipedia:Everything you need to know. As for shortcuts, we have a giant shortcut index, but for what it's worth they confused me lots too when I was starting out. Personally I never really "studied" them, you'll pick them up naturally with time :).
You can search the shortcuts just by going to the search bar and typing something like [[WP:AFD]]. WP and WT stands for Wikipedia and Wikipedia talk, respectively, which are pages related to project coordination (rather than actual encyclopedia articles).
Don't be afraid of messing up! Wikipedia:Be bold! It's okay to make mistakes, especially if you're just starting out. Feel free to ask any questions you may have (here at the Teahouse or on my talk page).

Patrolling Joseph Nwobike[edit]
Hello everyone,
I recently created the article Joseph Nwobike. It has been live for a while but is still marked as “unreviewed.”
Could you please take a look and let me know if it meets the requirements for notability and reliable sourcing? I would also like to understand if there is anything I should improve before it can be patrolled.
Thank you so much for your guidance! Nnamdi93 (talk) 16:47, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
At first glance everything looks good! The lead could use a few more citations, but otherwise everything else is great! New articles can take a while to be reviewed, WP:NPP will get to it eventually. mgjertson (talk) (contribs) 17:34, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Okay. That’s inspiring. Thank you for your concern. Nnamdi93 (talk) 08:14, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Nnamdi93 You don't always need citations in the WP:LEAD (see WP:LEADCITE) but it should be a summary of the main body of the article. At present, you have material in the lead that isn't anywhere else. I suggest you restrict the lead to the current first sentence, which summarises why he is notable, and place the rest of the paragraph into a section with a title like "Career".

Help me improve my contribution[edit]
Hi, Teahouse – Just attempted my first new page but I've made other contributions to Wikipedia over the years. New page was declined. Not sure what's wrong with the page, but I wonder if it's that I used Chat to put my content in proper Wikipedia code? (I kept messing up the code part so I finally fed the content to Chat for coding). I am a writer/editor, and thought the content I produced for this page was straightforward and unbiased. Page here: Draft:Priority_Technology_Holdings,_Inc.. Thanks! Alison Diane Jones (talk) 16:49, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Firstly please disclose your conflict of interest, per the request on your talk page and please don't use AI to edit here. Theroadislong (talk) 17:10, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
as user:theroadislong said, editors with a WP:COI are generally discouraged from writing new articles. While using an LLM for formatting is helpful, please note that you need to very carefully go over it to ensure it doesn't break any policies. The way some text is in bold to show emphasis isn't something we do here, but it is something LLMs tend to do for readability. Also, I noticed that the majority of your sources are either from the company itself or from press releases, which aren't considered reliable for anything that isn't WP:ABOUTSELF. mgjertson (talk) (contribs) 17:24, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hello, @Alison Diane Jones, and welcome to the Teahouse. On a (very quick) look through your draft, I don't see anything which suggests that this company is notable as Wikipedia uses the word. Most of the information in it is routine company information.

The best place to start is by finding sources. Find the sources before writing the article, and then use them to write the article with proper citations.

Hello, @Esa Redžović, and welcome to the Teahouse and to Wikipedia. I echo what the others have said. Note that nearly all of the sources that mgjertson mentions need to meet all the criteria in golden rule
My earnest advice to new editors is to not even think about
trying to create an article until you have spent several weeks - at least - learning about how Wikipedia works by making improvements to existing articles. Once you have understood core policies such as verifiability, neutral point of view, reliable, independent sources, and notability, and experienced how we handle disagreements with other editors (the Bold, Revert, Discuss cycle), then you might be ready to read your first article carefully, and try creating a draft. If you don't follow this advice but try to create an article without this preparation, you are likely to have a frustrating and disappointing experience with Wikipedia.

Same person?[edit]
How do I verify if two living people with the same career, nationality, age(-ish) are the same person?
The Anti-psychiatry#Tool of social control section cites a British GP Mike Fitzpatrick. This Michael Fitzpatrick (physician) article seems like it's them but it doesn't contain anything related to anti-psychiatry or the cited writings. Are there any methods to verify this? NinuKinuski (talk) 18:00, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The cited reference in the first article has links to the original journal article: there, the name of the article's author is a link to (quite a few) other pieces by the same writer. I suggest you inspect those to see if any are also mentioned in the physicians's article. {The poster formerly known as 87.81.230.195} 94.1.98.196 (talk) 01:24, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

The publications listed in [2] are all most certainly not by the same M Fitzpatrick, as it contains articles published from the 1940s to present day.

Toolforge dashboard for beginner editors[edit]
Hello Wikimedia community!
I’m planning to build a small Toolforge dashboard for new editors. The goal is to help newcomers contribute more confidently by providing:
Edit statistics (total edits, recent edits)
Suggested beginner-friendly edits (stub articles, small tasks)
Links to tutorials and guides
Before I start developing, I’d love your input:
Would this tool be useful for beginners?
Are there specific features or improvements you think would help new editors?
Any potential concerns I should be aware of?
Your feedback will help me focus on the most impactful features and ensure the tool meets the community’s needs. Thank you! LoraVega (talk) 18:16, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hi @LoraVega, interesting idea. What would be the difference between this and the WP:Newcomer homepage (Special:Homepage)? GoldRomean (talk) 18:51, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Great point — the Growth team’s Newcomer Homepage already provides onboarding, suggested edits, and mentorship. The difference is that my idea is for a community-built Toolforge dashboard, rather than a WMF-integrated feature.
The dashboard would be:
Independent and customizable (communities could propose new modules or workflows).
Cross-wiki (not just English Wikipedia, but also Commons/Wikidata if useful).
Lightweight — more of a “companion tool” that newcomers (or even casual editors) could use outside the wiki interface.
So instead of replacing the Newcomer Homepage, this would complement it — focusing on flexibility, experimentation, and cross-project stats/tasks. If it proves useful, it could even inform future Growth feature development. 84.22.38.36 (talk) 14:49, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Expanding a page[edit]
A stub page for an Italian bridge was recently added to the Explore section, and suggested that we expand it.
Then I found a full description in the Italian Wikipedia. Could it simply be translated and added to the English stub?
This seems like something that could be automatically done for any similar situation. Rossburnett (talk) 19:41, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Someone can translate it, but any content added here must still meet our requirements, such as those for sourcing and neutrality; see WP:Translate. Automatic translation is not an option. Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 21:22, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hello, Rossburnett, and welcome to the Teahouse. To add to what Andy says: few other Wikipedias are as strict about sourcing as English Wikipedia, so often attempting to translate an article from another language Wikipedia is effectively writing it backwards. An Article in English Wikipedia should be based almost entirely on sources which meet the golden rule. If this is true of the Italian article, then by all means translate it (remember to atttribute the origin in an edit summary - see translation) - but otherwise, you would be more likely to be successful if you treated it as a new article. --ColinFine (talk) 21:33, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The importance of a catalyst[edit]
I wrote and had published a narrative non-fiction book in April, 2022, "The Auschwitz Protocols. Czeslaw (Cselav) Mordowicz and the Race to Save Hungary's Jews." I updated the historical relevance of the escape from Auschwitz and testimony given by Ceslav and his partner Arnost Rosin at a Holocaust Conference in Cluj, Romania. The proceedings of that conference have just been published by the Eli Wiesel Institute and the Institute for Holocaust and genocidal Studies at Babes-Bolyai University in Cluj. I would like to add my short presentation from that volume, which includes reference to the establishment of a memorial at B'nai B'rith Foundation in Jerusalem last year honoring Ceslav and Arnost Rosin, alongside Rudoilf Vrba and his partner Fredo Wetsler as "Jews Who Saved Jews."
This recognition was part of the research B'nai B'rith did, 198.255.235.138 (talk) 20:05, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hello, IP user, and welcome to the Teahouse.
I'm not sure what you mean by "add my short presentation".
If you mean you want to create a Wikipedia article which summarises your book, then the answer is almost certainly No, because that would be original research, which is forbidden in Wikipedia.
If you mean you want to add a summary of it to an existing article, that may be possible; but it is regarded as a conflict of interest to cite your own work, so in that case you should raise an edit request on the article's talk page, so that an uninvolved editor can review your request and decide what to do about it. Be as specific as you can, and if possible cite any sources that you cite in the your book. ColinFine (talk) 21:38, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Publishing my first article[edit]
What is the right way to publish an article for a novice? Thedaveayo (talk) 20:46, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hi @Thedaveayo. If you're referring to the draft I rejected earlier:
Only topics that meet our criteria for inclusion can have an article on Wikipedia.
If a topic does meet that criteria, then the contents of that article is only a summary of what reliable mostly secondary sources describe about that topic.
Your draft neither showed evidence of meeting our criteria nor had any secondary sources.
I would recommend reading Wikipedia:Everything you need to know which describes our key policies in an easy to understand way. qcne (talk) 21:04, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Thedaveayo: The right way to get an article published for a novice. Follow these steps and read every link given:
Read WP:Golden rule carefully.
Gather multiple sources that meet all three criteria in WP:Golden rule before you write a single word. That is, don't write the article WP:BACKWARD.
Go to WP:YFA or WP:AFC or WP:Article wizard to start your article in draft space.
Write only what can be attributed to the sources you found, using your own words. Don't use ChatGPT or other LLM to write it for you, because we don't accept AI-written text and can easily detect when you've done that.
Submit it for review and wait for feedback.
If you follow those steps in that order, then your draft will more likely be accepted by a reviewer. If you don't follow those steps, your draft will likely be declined.. ~Anachronist (talk) 21:26, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Political BLPs and reactions relating to Charlie Kirk[edit]
I reverted this edit to Robin Vos. It included a quote about Charlie Kirk, and I removed the quote under the guise of WP:VNOT, WP:NOTE, and WP:REL (and it was just a quote without any relation to the article subject other than the fact that he said it...). Also Wikipedia:Not every single thing Donald Trump does deserves an article, because honestly nearly every subject of a political BLP is going to have some sort of reaction/talk about about Charlie Kirk, about 911, etc. Obviously there can be more relevant cases, but isn't WP:RECENT valid here too? Every congressional BLP has said something about Epstein, but that definitely doesn't merit inclusion. Am I on the right path? Looking for guidance because I know there will be a flood of quotes/sections about reactions (obviously WP:NOT also). --PerpetuityGrat (talk) 23:01, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Trouble Adding Additional Text to Page[edit]
Hello I am trying to edit the 2024 Manchester Airport brawl page. I edited this page earlier today and it was fine but now when I try to add additional text or letters to the page while typing I am not able to--although I can still delete text and correct spelling mistake by right clicking on the word. I got worried that it was my keyboard so I opened up a Google search bar just to make sure--and could type fine. I was just wondering why I wasn't able to add text to this page?
Thank you! Agnieszka653 (talk) 00:16, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Agnieszka653 this sounds like a browser issue. Try restarting your browser, going into incognito or private mode, or hard reloading the page. Does it work now? Sungodtemple (talk • contribs) 03:02, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Agnieszka653: You use VisualEditor which cannot add text in certain places because the existing content is template-generated. Before typing you should left-click on the location and see a blinking vertical bar indicating that typed text will go there. Does that explain your issue?

Possible autobiography for deletion or review[edit]
Hey folks, it's been a long time since I've edited Wikipedia. I encountered an article that seems pretty clearly to have been written by its subject. What's the best way to call attention to it? Thanks!
Here's the article: Gino J.H. McKoy. Marstead (talk) 01:49, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Template:AfD in 3 steps shows you exactly what to do, Marstead. Make sure that you provide a valid reason for deletion: however surprisingly, "written by subject" isn't among these; and #14, "Any other content not suitable for an encyclopedia" sounds rather weak. (A common riposte goes along the lines of "The content can be rewritten; the subject remains notable and encyclopedic.") -- Hoary (talk) 02:18, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Which of the article's many editors do you contend is the article subject (if you can say so without WP:OUTING), and why? Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 10:29, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The article looks like it has been nominated for deletion several times for several reasons: most severely, the article was recreated using the subject's full name rather than first and last name in order to dodge a successful deletion of the previous form of the article (which was just his full name). After that there have been triggered deletion discussions for notability, apparent autobiography, and so-called "advertorialized" edits. I do see a lot of editors in the page history but suspect several of them may have been the subject's employees or associates.
As far as evidence of autobiography the big tell to me are the two uncited lines in the article about how the subject's ideas were plagiarized by House of Cards and how the subject was the "first screenwriter to write about Bitcoin and the Deep Web". Really random factoids to throw in there uncited and not the sort of thing a person other than the subject would invent out of whole cloth. After seeing the subject's attempts to mass-create Rotten Tomatoes and Letterboxd accounts to inflate the rating for his 2024 film it would seem extremely consistent with his behavior for him to also try to keep editing his Wikipedia page in bad faith. Marstead (talk) 15:05, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Article image preview discrepancy[edit]
I have a question around the selection of images for preview when hovered over or shown in search results. My understanding is the following describes the logic for which image is selected: mw:Page Previews- image choice.
However, I can see a discrepancy for the following article: Homeland Party (United Kingdom). If you hover over it here, the lead logo is displayed in the preview. If you search for the article using the Wikipedia search bar though, it comes up with the Wikimedia Commons 'Eagle_with_fasces.svg' file. Just trying to figure out why.

I made a mistake 5 years ago[edit]
I made a mistake 5 years ago and nuked a page by mistake, but they were able to recover it.
It's been bothering me for a while now that I never gave a proper apology.
Wiki pages are difficult to edit, and it's still difficult to understand how I'm supposed to do that.
I think someone once linked me to a page to the bbcode process or something? I still don't understand what I'm supposed to click on for suggesting edits by looking at the pages.

@AKB769: It takes seconds to revert an edit so don't worry about it. Thousands of edits are reverted daily. See Help:Reverting for how to do it yourself but you can also ask for help here. You can use the "Show preview" button before saving to check what your edit will look like. If you want to avoid the error you probably made five years ago then check that the content right below your change is still displayed in the preview.

Thanks! I'm still having trouble understanding how to format things.
The best I can do is play on my sandbox page before finding the talk option on the wiki page to post a wall of things to suggest adding. It covers quite a bit of information, so I'm not sure how to section it off, either.
It also appears that the page itself isn't actually paid much attention to as well, so I dunno how much use I will be if get everything formatted wrong in the first place. AKB769 (talk) 20:46, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
AKB769, I haven't read the content of your sandbox, but a glance at it suggests that it's a draft about a video game, or collection of video games. It comes with 14 references.

Varda's moon[edit]
Um Can I add some facts in ilmarë (Varda's moon)? I added"It's also possibly the Second biggest known irregular moon in the solar system after Proteus which has a diameter of 420 km" That's because Ilmarë has a diameter of 403 km but ProEditor changed it because he thought it's unconstructive. I added it because I don't want ilmarë to be a forgotten moon, It's rarely talked about despite having a diameter much larger than the famous moon Hyperion. My planet is Homlos (talk) 10:48, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

@My planet is Homlos Looking at [3] (@TheProEditor11, you could have been arsed to use Help:Edit summary, especially with that username), as written, it's just your own musing. Can you find an astronomer who said that and cite them? Gråbergs Gråa Sång (talk) 11:07, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Gråbergs Gråa Sång... Thank you for mentioning me to this discussion... Firstly, I used Twinkle's [vandalism] revert option to revert the edit and it doesn't have an option to give a summary.
The reason I undone his edits are:-
1. [1] Does his edit summary make any sense? There is a clear article on Proteus (moon), yet he linked it with Neptune. He said - he is getting some type of god while trying to link Proteus. LOL!!
2. He doesn't provide any reference to his edits.
3. [2] Now, you people tell me - again, does his edit summary as well as his edit make any sense?
4. [3] He has been warned earlier for doing possible unconstructive editing, though he has resolved the issue with the editor. This again implies that he has a sheer history of adding uncited and unreferenced content to Wiki articles, as well as probably linking it with wrong pages. This creates a confusion among the editors in distinguishing if he has done constructive and helpful edits or has just vandalised the articles he has put his hands on.
I hope I was able to explain the issue... @My planet is Homlos... I understand that MPIH is a new editor and I believe that he will be a great contributor in the future, but he has to learn about "at least" basic Wikipedia policies. He has to provide appropriate edit summary and reliable sources for edits he make.
.
Thanks!! :) - TheProEditor11 (talk) 03:42, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
It makes sense to me but If it doesn't make sense to you, It's OK,I won't cause anymore trouble. I do not want to have somebody doing a YouTube video called"My planet is Homlos is destroying Wikipedia,We must arrest him" I know nothing about Wikipedia,I joined like 6 days ago and I'm not even an adult,I wanted to edit some moons' mass in the list"Planetary-mass moons" because The data in the list was not matched with their individual pages but I didn't provide edit summary so It got reverted by Skywatcher68"unexplained number change" He told me that I needed to provide an edit summary so every edit I do,I will provide edit summary. Then In ilmarë's individual page. I think ilmarë is the second largest known non-spherical moon because its diameter is literally like 403 km, it's also likely to be non-spherical so it's possible that it's the second largest known non-spherical moon ,Its diameter is bigger than Mimas. The only one bigger than it is Proteus with a diameter of 420 km. Both of them are larger than Mimas but the reason why I put"possible" is because Ilmarë's diameter could range from 363 km all the way to 443 km. Why can't I find any sources saying that? It's because Ilmarë is too forgotten and nobody talks about it but by logic it's possible that I'm right. And it's also possible that another moon called "Actaea" (Salacia's moon) could be the third largest known non-spherical moon because its diameter is 393 km, surpassing Nereid, Hyperion, Hi'iaka... and many large Non-spherical moons,so It's possibly the third. But again,I can't say that because there's no source talking about this moon,Too forgotten so Even if it's logically right that Ilmarë and Actaea is the second and third largest known non-spherical moon in the solar system,I cannot add that fact:( . Also,I had no idea why ilmarë and Actaea's so forgotten,Despite their large sizes. I just wanted to add a cool fact but I can't:( But thanks for reading! My planet is Homlos (talk) 04:57, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Also,When I add Proteus,It came out as a god at first,well because it's named after a God,So I changed it to"Neptune | Proteus" because I saw other examples and it's like that but when I clicked into that link, Neptune came out lol My planet is Homlos (talk) 05:28, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
You can always add facts, so long as they're properly sourced, relevant, and you don't edit war anything in. Problem in your case is you didn't make any cite for the fact, you just added it in. It's crucial on Wikipedia to cite supporting material for facts added to an article, not merely assert them.
Also, the series of edits was a bit sloppy: you capitalized "second" and "possibly" and made two links to Proteus, the first to the wrong Proteus, and then to an article that didn't exist. That's less of an issue than the uncited addition (it's Proteus (moon)) but do try and be careful. CoffeeCrumbs (talk) 11:11, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
There's no source talking about that because Ilmarë is too forgotten and no one talks about it, But by logic ,Proteus is a non-spherical moon that has a diameter of 420 km,no other non-spherical moons are larger than it, Ilmarë is the 2nd with a diameter of 403 km, Which is smaller than Proteus but there's no known moons with a diameter between 420 km and 403 km,so Ilmarë is in fact possibly the 2nd largest non-spherical known moon in the solar system. And The 3rd is likely to be Actaea (Salacia's moon) with a diameter of about 393 km,and
there's no known moons with a diameter between 403 km and 393 km,so Actaea is in fact possibly the 3rd largest non-spherical known moon in the solar system. But still, there's no source talking about it because Moons of dwarf planet candidates are too forgotten, sometimes even Proteus is forgotten and some sources just claim that Hyperion is the largest known non-spherical moon in the solar system. By logic, Ilmarë is in fact the 2nd largest known non-spherical moon in the solar system. However I can't add that fact? My planet is Homlos (talk) 11:45, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@My planet is Homlos No you can't. Your question is clearly answered above. Shantavira|feed me 12:26, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

@My planet is Homlos: Hi, I am going to say that Ilmarë is not the second biggest moon. What's more important, it's even not a moon but rather ...an Indonesian flower.
Now, other editors need (and Wikipedia readers even more so) to get convinced who of us two is right. As long as you don't reference to any reliable source to support your claim, it's not a bit more valid than mine.

Ok My planet is Homlos (talk) 22:30, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The AI overview in Google said this"No, Ilmarë is not larger than Hyperion; Ilmarë has a diameter of approximately 403 km, while Hyperion's dimensions are 370 × 280 × 225 km, making Hyperion's longest dimension larger than Ilmarë's entire diameter. " Which doesn't really makes sense but whatever what,I still do want Ilmarë to get attention.

I will Def lose lol, Other Editors definitely will say that you are right, even if ilmarë is a real moon, I literally joined like 5 days ago,and you joined 20 yrs ago, I was not even born.

@My planet is Homlos: First you said it's "possibly the Second largest non-spherical moon in the solar system", then you said it "is in fact the 2nd largest known non-spherical moon in the solar system".

By logic it's in fact that,But There are uncertainties because Ilmarë's diameter is 403±40 so it could be 363km-443 km so that's why I added"possibly" My planet is Homlos (talk) 13:31, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I knew this from Proteus and Ilmarë's individual page here in Wikipedia My planet is Homlos (talk) 23:26, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@My planet is Homlos: First, there's no win. Wikipedia is not a battleground (→WP:BATTLE), it's an encyclopedia (→WP:5P1).
Second, as an encyclopedia, Wikipedia collects and provides well-established knowledge. That means we publish no original research (→WP:NOR), everything needs to be based on published (→WP:PUBLISHED), reliable (→WP:RS), secondary (→WP:SECONDARY) sources.
Third, there are exceptions from the second, like routine calculations (→WP:CALC). This seems what you did above – you took known sizes, you compared them, and you want to publish the conclusion.
Alas – this is the fourth important note – your input data (sizes of moons) are not exact. What's more, you took them from Wikipedia itself, and Wikipedia is not a reliable source for Wikipedia (→WP:NOTSOURCE). That seems surprising, as it was to me, too. However it is deeply based on Wikipedia nature: its articles are written by volunteers, like you and me, who come and go (or sometimes loose interest in some areas). This leads to multiple articles being abandoned and not kept up to date. Additionally, they sometimes are destroyed (→WP:VANDAL) and then not repaired due to lack of commited watchers (→WP:W). So your calculation, even though done with good intention, qualifies as non-reliable and needs to be discarded as such. I understand it is quite discouraging for new commers, but that's a way of our community to keep the project valuable and reliable for readers – Verifiability, not truth (→WP:TRUTH). Fifth, and last, I apologize for being a bit ironic or harsh in my comments above. I just didn't notice you are a new editor and have not realized you may not be fluent in our rules yet. Please, don't get discouraged by me! I hope the links I included above will help you to avoid many mistakes in your further contribution here.
Oh, and one more thing: making what you think is good is not a crime at Wikipedia. Just be bold and do (→WP:BOLD). If you happen to break some rule, someone will revert your changes and hopefully leave some information what went wrong. Then go to the talk page of the article (→WP:TALK) and discuss the problem (please also remember to add a notification to invoved parties (→WP:PING) so they don't miss your comments). This is a common Bold–Revert–Discuss cycle which (→WP:BRD) which helps editors to convert misunderstandings into agreement and cooperation. --CiaPan (talk) 10:36, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Yeah I'm not even fluent in English,Let alone the rules in Wikipedia... Thx for the reply,but I think in ilmarë's individual page,The diameter of it has a reliable source. It's Ok Polish guy:) I'm not discouraged. I joined Wikipedia because I'm really interested in space and I'm a planetballs guy, I'm interested in their characteristics but some of them's mass looked kinda wrong so I changed some of them,and most of their diameters has a source in their individual pages.
Also,A decent amount of people think that editing Wikipedia is now my full time job, But It's not,I still have to go to school. My planet is Homlos (talk) 13:05, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Licensing of Google gemini images[edit]
I have a concern regarding the licensing of images generated by the google Gemini. As there are many peoples from 1990s or more early who didn’t have single image on their page and i am thinking to create their image and put them there. Does they fall under copyright or public domain. TheSlumPanda (talk) 13:11, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Please consult Wikipedia:AI#What is Wikipedia's AI policy?, with its several links to further material about (mostly not) using AI-generated images in Wikipedia.
Three of the major problems with using AI images are:
The generating programs are trained on large amounts of copyrighted images, so their output arguably infringes copyrights legally and/or morally;
The image cannot be attributed to an acceptable published source as is required; and
the result falls foul of Wikipedia policies against including original research {The poster formerly known as 87.81.230.195} 94.1.98.196 (talk) 13:28, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@TheSlumPanda We don't want AI slop for text on Wikipedia and if you look at that article, you'll see the sort of nonsense image that AI can produce. How would readers be able to verify that your proposed images were in any way accurate? Verification is one of the core policies that makes Wikipedia successful. Mike Turnbull (talk) 14:02, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Michael D. Turnbull Yes i agree that verification is the main thing. But there are many notable persons on Wikipedia which doesn’t have a single image there. Btw Thanks TheSlumPanda (talk) 17:37, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
That's true, TheSlumPanda, and unfortunate. But that doesn't mean that we can necessarily do anything about it, copyright law being what it is. What English Wikipedia does allow (and some other language versions don't) specifically for this reason, is for non-free images to be used in certain restricted circumstances (see WP:NFCC). But one of those circumstances is that no free image could possibly be found, and that condition is almost never met for a living person. --ColinFine (talk) 18:03, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Hi there,
I'm still fairly new tae editing on Wikipedia, but I've been thinkin' aboot startin’ some articles on lesser-known places in Scotland – wee villages, historic spots, maybe even a few local landmarks that dinnae get much attention.
I've done some light editing here and there, but I’m no entirely sure how tae go about creatin’ a new article properly. Is there a standard way these kinds of location pages should be laid out? And how dae I tell if a place is considered notable enough for its own page?

Redirects only[edit]
I was trying to use this tool to check on all the redirects that I have ever created. It failed when I tried to load. I know that I've created probably at least 20,000 redirects, so it likely was going to take a while, but I cannot get the link to work. Anyone able to help or provide me with a link that would work for checking on all my redirects ever created? Iljhgtn (talk) 21:52, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Iljhgtn Since you have create hardly any new articles, only redirects, you can just use Special:Contributions to find them. I limited User contributions for Iljhgtn by looking only for new pages in mainspace for a recent few months but from that you should see how to find them all. Or you could start with Iljhgtn - Wikipedia (en.wikipedia.org) - Edit Counter - XTools which includes a link to the 29,610 pages created but I assume that link is the one you can't get to work. Mike Turnbull (talk) 13:29, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

How to place a new listing[edit]
What is meant by a "license."
I want to talk/write about my restaurant in NYC to correct incorrect information that somebody has posted about it.
I want to put a padlock on my writing so it can't be ambushed.
I want to be able to type without having all the geek symbols I don't understand at age 86.
I will pay for assistance if someone would individually help me step by step.
Is that possible? YodelandEcho (talk) 22:04, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
You have a conflict of interest with FOOD (New York City restaurant) and you need to declare that on your user page.
There is absolutely no way we would protect an article so that only a person with a conflict of interest can edit it, and this is technically impossible anyway. The protection levels are tied to the editor type, such as preventing new editors from editing, or preventing anyone but experienced editors or administrators from editing.
Because you have a conflict of interest, you should not be making any substantive changes to the article. Use the WP:Edit Request Wizard to propose changes on the talk page instead. You can make minor fixes to typos, names, numbers, and dates. You can revert obvious vandalism. You can add citations to sources independent of you. Anything more substantive, however, you should propose on the talk page.
Assistance is free. Just use WP:Edit Request Wizard to propose changes you want to make. ~Anachronist (talk) 22:35, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
YodelandEcho Now that you have publicly stated you would be willing to pay someone, you may get solicitations from scammers who monitor this page. Do not give anyone your hard earned money. See WP:SCAM. 331dot (talk) 22:49, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hi there! thanks for your interest in the project! Around here, we don't necessarily want the truth, we want what's verifiable. So, if some bit of information is inaccurate, the only way to change it is by finding a reliable third party source that contains that information. We also don't care about what the subject of the article has said about themselves, as that is unreliable (for example, say there's a person very obviously guilty of a crime. If they insist they aren't guilty, we wouldn't automatically take their word as fact unless there's good evidence they were wrongly convicted). If you'd still like to contribute, there is a visual editor that is similar to programs like Microsoft Word or LibreOffice Writer. Do note that if you have any connection to the restaurant you shouldn't edit the article as you'd have a conflict of interest and that makes it very difficult to write neutrally about the subject even if you think you can. I hope you understand that all these rules are here for a reason and ensure Wikipedia is a reliable source of information, even if they may seem a bit silly at times mgjertson (talk) (contribs) 02:01, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

I have had a article waiting for a approval after edits since June 29. How do I get someone to look at it? Bobkel1414 (talk) 22:30, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Nobody will look at it if you don't submit it for review. I see someone removed the prior AFC notices from Draft:Robert Thomas Kellam, which included a "resubmit" button. I have restored those notices, so now you may submit it for review. However, there has been only one edit since a reviewer declined it, so please check that the current version is something you really want to submit.
I can tell you, it would never be accepted with sentences about a person that don't cite any sources. It is not ready to be reviewed again. Fix the problems first. ~Anachronist (talk) 22:41, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

獅眠洞, (i) You should be asking at Wikimedia Commons rather than here. (ii) The limit you describe is incompatible with Wikimedia Commons. (iii) Citing email from the copyright holder isn't an acceptable way of explaining copyright status. -- Hoary (talk) 09:16, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hello, @獅眠洞, and welcome to the Teahouse.
I'm afraid that it doesn't work that way. One of the principal goals of Wikimedia projects is to provide a resource that anybody can reuse for any purpose, and so most of its content, including most images, must be available for anybody to reuse - either in the public domain, or licensed by the copyright holder in a way that permits free use.
Because it is often difficult to find images that meet these requirements, English Wikipedia (though not all language
Wikipedias) permits non-free content in certain circumstances. But I'm afraid that adding an image to a list article will never allow that.
Please see Image use policy for more information. ColinFine (talk) 11:45, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
ok thanks, i will try to convince the author to give us permission to use these images under CC lisence. 獅眠洞 (talk) 20:13, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
獅眠洞, it's not clear that you understand. The copyright holder has to apply one or other particular CC license, giving anyone (including its commercial competitors) permission to use these images, even for commercial purposes. -- Hoary (talk) 22:01, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Pedioplanis husabensis[edit]
Pedioplanis husabensis
Good morning!
I am kindly asking for support with this page. I am obviously too old to get to grips with the procedure of contributing "properly"
Here is my request:
In the early 1980's I worked as a curator for reptiles and amphibians at the then State Museum Windhoek in South West Africa/Namibia.
In the course of an ecological survey of the Rössing Uranium Mine I discovered a still undescribed Lizard which I described - together with my friend Werner Mayer (deceased 2015) - as the new species "Pedioplanis husabensis.
The publication was called
"On the parapatric existence of two species of the Pedioplanis undata group (Reptilia: Sauria: Lacertidae) in the central Namib desert (Southwest Africa) with description of the new species Pedioplanis husabensis"
It is available online: https://www.zobodat.at/pdf/HER_1_3_4_0083-0095.pdf
This reference is currently placed under "further reading". I'd like to move the link & text from "further reading" to "reference N° 1 since I feel that the original publication should be the primary reference to the species.
Apart from this request, I can deliver valuable information about distribution and diagnostic features.
Here is a link to a rather precise *.kmz file which shows the distribution map on Google Earth:

I agree that the work should be cited as a reference; for technical reasons it can't be listed first (the order is that in which they are used in the article, and has no deeper significance); and have done so. Thank you for the suggestion, and the distribution data. You may also be interested to know that our sibling project, Wikispecies, has an entry: species:Pedioplanis husabensis, and there is another on Wikidata, at d:Q5077620.

Notability about a place[edit]

@Osa Akwamarynowa You are probably thinking of the guidance at WP:GEOLAND.

Latest sport games in infoboxes[edit]
Pages like India national cricket team and Pakistan national cricket team, and I am assuming the rest, too, have the last games played in every format mentioned in the infobox.
Given the frequency with which these teams play, is there really a point in us keeping a track of every single match and making an edit every few days to this? I don't feel it is very encyclopaedic.
I want to propose exclusion of the latest games played by an active sports team from the infobox.
Where should I propose this?
And is there even a hope in my appeal being accepted? Kingsacrificer (talk) 14:22, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Help Me See Edit Revert As Good Faith[edit]
A one-sentence edit I made last week was reverted. This is the first time a revert has happened to me. Reading WP:RV and WP:ROWN, it did not seem to me that a revert was warranted.
I started a discussion on the talk page: Talk:TESCREAL#Considering RfC regarding sentence about the origin Three other editors (not the one who did the revert) have replied, very briefly, to my lengthy explanation of my edit. I am having trouble seeing the revert as having been done in good faith, and these replies have not helped. Can someone please help me see it that way? Perhaps if someone who understands their POV restates it a bit less tersely, I will get it. Aurodea108 (talk) 19:09, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hello, @Aurodea108. As I can't see why you think the edit was in bad faith, I'm not sure that I can help you to not see it that way, but I'll stick my twopennyworth in.
A Wikipedia article should be a summary of what the sources say about the subject, not what you (or I, or other editors) know, think, or believe about the subject.
If a source does not directly say anything about the subject (specifically) then it is hard to see why that source should be cited, or what can relevantly go into the article on the basis of that source. If the source does not specifically say that it is about the origin of TESCREAL, then it cannot be used to support a statement about the origin of TESCREAL.
I also suggest that if several editors disagree with you then it's time to drop the stick. ColinFine (talk) 19:59, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Thank you @ColinFine for taking the time to reply to me extensively.
I take it you have already read completely the posts I made in that discussion thread, for which I also thank you.
The source grouped the TESCREAL paper among several earlier papers, which it described as seeing AI in a certain way.
If I understand you correctly, in order for the source to be relevant, it would have had to say explicitly something like, "First Kalluri wrote that AI may 'build systems that sanctify the status quo and advance the interests of the powerful', then Birhane and Guest wrote...then...and most recently, Gebru and Torres came up with the acronym TESCREAL to describe the ideologies they see as underpinning AI. These are
some of the authors that see ‘AI’ as a way to advance capitalist, kyriarchal, authoritarian and/or white supremacist goals." The source said this succinctly, expecting the reader to be able to follow the references and unpack their clause into something like what I just wrote, rather than explicitly. Hence the source did not explicitly use the word "TESCREAL" and is being seen by you and others as not relevant.
If indeed I am understanding you correctly, then I would respond that the hypothetical passage I just wrote is more like what a good professor might write for their lower-division undergraduate students, and is not to be expected in a research-level academic paper.
The unpacking that I just did is almost a mechanical exercise, and should not change the answer to whether the source is relevant or not.
Part of the reason I am wondering about bad faith is what I am seeing as nitpicking about a stylistic choice on the part of the source.
Part of my reason for wondering about bad faith is admittedly due to the history of that page, some of which can be seen at the Talk page (some has been archived). It seems to me that my sentence, which is about a "meta" question (where did the idea of TESCREAL come from?) may have been reverted because other, less "meta", questions (does TESCREAL describe a real phenomenon? should TESCREAL be described on WP?) are contentious.
As for whether to "drop the stick", I will keep your suggestion in mind and give it some time. Aurodea108 (talk) 22:11, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
No, @Aurodea108, I haven't closely read the posts. I (and I think the other editors) are arguing on the basis of Wikipedia policy. If it is not discussed in one of the sources, it should not be discussed in the article. Period. ColinFine (talk) 22:22, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Creating redirects to replace red links on talk pages and replacing speedy deletion tags[edit]
A veteran editor red linked something on a talk page (relevant rev here). He then subsequently created a redirect to have that red link redirect to a related article (redirect creation here). I let the user know that I thought a piped link was more appropriate since I didn't think the redirect made much sense, especially because it was created solely for a talk page mention. It makes it more difficult to find an article with a very similar name (The Transgender Issue) which seems to me to be reason #1 for WP:RDEL. The user agreed, replaced the link with a piped link and then effectively blanked the redirect page (here), requesting speedy deletion. I wasn't sure what to do at that point because the user seemingly forgot to add a speedy deletion template. Another user added a speedy deletion template (here). This template was subsequently removed by another user to turn the old redirect page into a disambiguation page.
My questions are:
Is it common practice to create borderline arbitrary redirect pages in order to remove red links on talk pages? (as the creator claimed they had been doing for 1/4 century)
Are you allowed to remove a speedy deletion tag if you weren't the one who placed it?
EDIT: I read up on the second one. Per the deletion policy: Anyone except a page's creator may contest the speedy deletion of a page by removing the deletion notice from the page. 23:16, 14 September 2025 (UTC)
quidama talk 22:57, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Quidama: Redirects that you are talking about are in article space, and so should serve an encyclopedic service. But each one should be considered on its merit. Speedy delete criterion template:R3 may apply, or WP:RFD if it needs a discussion. Graeme Bartlett (talk) 23:55, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Best practice for size of edits[edit]
When an article needs heavy editing, is it better to do several small edits or one big edit? Also if you plan on editing very different parts of a page, such as tables, lists, and text, is it better to focus on only one per edit? I was wondering if small edits make reverting easier, because the good edits don’t have to be reverted along with the bad one. BrightPinkBirb (talk) 23:37, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
If you are uncertain as to whether your edit needs to be reverted, perhaps you should use the preview function. For an article that is very active, then smaller edits are better to avoid an edit conflict. Also for a controversial article, small edits are better in case of explanation required or disagreement. Also consider if your browser saves your editing. If you do a long big edit and the power goes off, or Wikipedia goes into maintenance mode or something crashes, you don't want to lose your work. Perhaps adding one section or paragraph at a time for inactive articles is a good compromise against losing your work. Graeme Bartlett (talk) 00:02, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Editing User Page[edit]
How can I edit my user page? PBGen Andre Perez Dizon 1994 (talk) 23:58, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@PBGen Andre Perez Dizon 1994: You have already been editing your user page. However I would ask you, are you making an article draft? If so you should use your sandbox User:PBGen Andre Perez Dizon 1994/sandbox. And the tone is not encyclopedic. If this is about you, please read WP:Autobiography. And if it is not an article, but supposed to be your WP:Userpage, then the content is far too excessive, and you should concentrate on improving Wikipedia by editing other pages first.
