Draft feedback, newbie[edit]
Hi, I am a new Wikipedia contributor (this is only my second page creation). I‚Äôve been working on a draft here: User:SueRostvold/De Lewellen.
I‚Äôve gathered a ton of references, and I‚Äôd appreciate feedback on whether my draft looks neutral in tone, and if my citations and formatting are on the right track before I submit it.
Any and all feedback appreciated. (I can take it.)¬†;)
Thanks so much for your help!
SueRostvold (talk) 17:17, 8 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@SueRostvold Take a look at WP:Named references for how to re-use some citations that you currently have repeated multiple times (e.g. to "Punk in Austin"). I suggest you move your draft to Draft:De Lewellen and then submit it for a formal review as described at WP:Articles for creation. Mike Turnbull (talk) 17:32, 8 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Okay. I will do that before I submit. Thanks. SueRostvold (talk) 18:02, 8 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Regarding the multiple references Mike, yes I knew it looked bad. But while working on the page it was helping me keep everything straight. But my plan was to fix before submitting. Thanks again for your input. SueRostvold (talk) 21:23, 8 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@SueRostvold Welcome to the Teahouse. I made a small tweak to your draft. If you like, you can move it to the Draft namespace yourself, or I can do it for you. After that, you can submit for AFC review.ThilioR O B O Tü§ñ talk 17:46, 8 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hello, SueRostvold. Your draft had those irritating ** double asterisks scattered through it. They have since been removed and replaced by inappropriate use of italics. Those are indicative of content cranked out by Artificial Intelligence robots that are prone to hallucinations and falsification. We want content on Wikipedia that is written and verified by living, breathing human beings. Please read Wikipedia:Artificial intelligence for guidance. Cullen328 (talk) 17:47, 8 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hi Cullen328. Understood. Noted. I have found chatgpt useful in hunting sources for me. (That is allowed right?) I have done my best to verify all links before using. I will read the article you suggested for guidance. Thanks for pointing me in that direction. So much to learn. SueRostvold (talk) 18:05, 8 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hi @SueRostvold, this is a bit late but just in case no one's mentioned it - getting ChatGPT (or any other AI/LLM) to find sources for you is a very bad idea. AI is extremely prone to hallucinations, which means it just makes things up. It knows you want sources, and it's going to provide sources to make you happy even if they don't actually exist! Doing your own search via Google, newspaper archives, etc is usually the best way to go. If you feel you must use ChatGPT, make absolutely sure that the links it gives you actually exist and say what it tells you they say. Do not trust the robot - it wants to answer your question in a way you will like, which isn't necessarily giving you accurate information. Welcome to Wikipedia and happy editing! Meadowlark (talk) 09:57, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Thanks! I agree 100%. Chatgpt isn't not always right, often wrong. I use it sparingly. I have found it's best to search newspaper archives myself (also fun). But yes, I always check the sources. Thank you for the reminder though.¬†:) SueRostvold (talk) 12:24, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I am not quite ready for AFC review. But thanks. Let me get back to you on this. I need to learn how to do some stuff myself. Thank you for your time. Appreciate it. SueRostvold (talk) 18:03, 8 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hi Thilio, thank you for the tweak. I appreciate you time. It I accidentally undo what you do, I apologize. I was going to work on cleaning up my links. I often work outside of wikipedia and then transfer to my draft. So if you changed, added or removed something and I don't know what, I might undo it accidentally. Hope I'm making sense. Thoughts on this? I went to history to try to see what you did but couldn't figure it out. - I know just enough to be dangerous on Wikipedia I guess. My goal is to not piss anyone off and follow the rules. Try not to get blocked again because I forgot a colon in my draft categories. Wish me luck.¬†:) SueRostvold (talk) 18:15, 8 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
replacing photo[edit]
Comments to me included the fact that the photo of the subject in the biography was no good. I want to replace it now with a good one but I can't figure out how to delete the bad one.Draft:Morris Miller. Equusreserve (talk) 07:03, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hi Equusreserve. Is the new photo still in a PDF file? An image format like PNG or JPG would be better. It affects what should be done with the PDF version. PrimeHunter (talk) 09:16, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
the new photo is PDF and I'll change it to PNG ort JPG if necessary, but my problem is how to delete the old bad photo which is a word thumbnail and was one of the reasons my article wasn't accepted. How to delete it? thanks. Equusreserve (talk) 06:49, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Where did you find that image? Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 12:24, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
the image I want to use is a photo I've taken of the original photo. High quality. but again, that's not the problem. How to delete the old bad one? Equusreserve (talk) 06:50, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
can I click 'talk to andy" and have a direct exchange with you on email or whatever? Equusreserve (talk) 06:51, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
That's a link to my talk page (see WP:Talk pages).
You can email me via the link on my user page; but only do so, please, if it's a matter that for some good reason can't be discussed on my talk page.
But my question was: where did you find the original photo? Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 10:14, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
it was from an old photo that had several other in it. I cropped it down to just his head, saved it on word and uploaded it. Equusreserve (talk) 15:23, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Equusreserve Andy's question was where you obtained the original photo. If it came, for example, from some website then you do not own the copyright and your derivative work may not be used on Wikipedia except under our fair use provisions, which we do allow for images of deceased individuals. Even then, the image may only be added to live articles, not drafts. Also, you seem to have uploaded your citations to a proquest account but for a judge like Miller I would expect most of the underlying material to be from contemporary newspapers. It would be much better to use the {{cite news}} template giving details of the authors and the newspaper title, publication date etc. You do not have to provide working links to copies of the actual newspapers. For example.[1] Mike Turnbull (talk) 15:37, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Thanks to both of you. This ain't easy for an old guy but I think I now have the sources right. Please check.
Still not clear how to delete the one picture and then add the new one.
The one I want to delete was my cropped version of an old photo.
The original of that had several other people in it so I cropped it to just the head.
And then it turned out to be a very small image. Even if I could fix that, I'd much rather use a new much better one that I've found.
Is there some way for this system to alert me when I get a message from you two or any other editor? Right now, I go to this page to see if there's any feedback, but if I didn't return to it on my own, I'd never know. Equusreserve (talk) 08:03, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Equusreserve -- and (if I remember to sign this message) I have thereby alerted you that there's a message from me, mentioning you (and possibly addressed to you) -- Yann "deleted page File:Morris Miller.pdf (Copyright violation: Miller died in 1970. This is not a 2025 image and likely not own work.)" The replacement that you hope to add in place of Morris Miller.pdf: Who owns its copyright? -- Hoary (talk) 09:10, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
As a family member (as you know), the photo is in my possession so I own the copyright. I've uploaded the photo for you but not here obviously.
Rather, it's somehow available to you elsewhere... Equusreserve (talk) 11:39, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
"the photo is in my possession so I own the copyright"‚ÄîThat is a non sequitur; ownership of a copy (or even a negative) does not in itself confer copyright.
"somehow available to you elsewhere"‚ÄîPlease don't post riddles. Act in good faith, or not at all. Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 12:49, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

IP Peer Review.[edit]
Peer Review Guidelines is not clear on whether IP editors can nominate for PR. Though I won't remember to do it by the time I get home. I know intellectually that its unlikely due to IP editors not being able to create pages however.

I see nothing to prevent an IP address from requesting a peer review. The only thing that would stop you is a semi-protected talk page. Otherwise, just follow the instructions. ~Anachronist (talk) 14:48, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Yep, can't create the PR page

Ah, I see. Right, if you have to create a page, that stops an IP editor from proceeding. Do you have an objection to creating an account for yourself? ~Anachronist (talk) 15:01, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Technical Errors prevent me from doing so. I would use my account if I was able to. 24.155.147.109 (talk) 15:08, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Technical errors? For an existing account? Can you elaborate? At first I was thinking the account may need IP block exemption, but you're already editing from an IP address and clearly not blocked. ~Anachronist (talk) 21:19, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

OK. I don't understand why you can't log into one account from school, and log into another account from home. ~Anachronist (talk) 21:13, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
because I can't log in within Georgetown Independent School District at all. The district decided to remove access to central auth early last school year. The only possible way for me to log in is if an WP:ADMIN moved User:IPOfAFlower to a local (enwiki) account. 24.155.147.109 (talk) 13:36, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Patrolling Joseph Nwobike[edit]
Hello everyone,
I recently created the article Joseph Nwobike. It has been live for a while but is still marked as ‚Äúunreviewed.‚Äù
Could you please take a look and let me know if it meets the requirements for notability and reliable sourcing? I would also like to understand if there is anything I should improve before it can be patrolled.
Thank you so much for your guidance! Nnamdi93 (talk) 16:47, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
At first glance everything looks good! The lead could use a few more citations, but otherwise everything else is great! New articles can take a while to be reviewed, WP:NPP will get to it eventually. mgjertson (talk) (contribs) 17:34, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Okay. That‚Äôs inspiring. Thank you for your concern. Nnamdi93 (talk) 08:14, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Nnamdi93 You don't always need citations in the WP:LEAD (see WP:LEADCITE) but it should be a summary of the main body of the article. At present, you have material in the lead that isn't anywhere else. I suggest you restrict the lead to the current first sentence, which summarises why he is notable, and place the rest of the paragraph into a section with a title like "Career". Mike Turnbull (talk) 14:26, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Okay. Thank you.Nnamdi93 (talk) 08:16, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Political BLPs and reactions relating to Charlie Kirk[edit]
I reverted this edit to Robin Vos. It included a quote about Charlie Kirk, and I removed the quote under the guise of WP:VNOT, WP:NOTE, and WP:REL (and it was just a quote without any relation to the article subject other than the fact that he said it...). Also Wikipedia:Not every single thing Donald Trump does deserves an article, because honestly nearly every subject of a political BLP is going to have some sort of reaction/talk about about Charlie Kirk, about 911, etc. Obviously there can be more relevant cases, but isn't WP:RECENT valid here too? Every congressional BLP has said something about Epstein, but that definitely doesn't merit inclusion. Am I on the right path? Looking for guidance because I know there will be a flood of quotes/sections about reactions (obviously WP:NOT also). --PerpetuityGrat (talk) 23:01, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Yes, it's humdrum stuff, probably not worth mentioning, let alone worth quoting verbatim. -- Hoary (talk) 02:22, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
You love the word humdrum Kingsacrificer (talk) 13:48, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Hoary: @Kingsacrificer: ok, but if you saw a quote randomly inserted like that, would it be because of the guidelines that I mentioned? Or others? --PerpetuityGrat (talk) 13:56, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Kingsacrificer, thank you for the tip-off. It appears that my mind follows onomasiological ruts. From now, I'll try to avoid overusing humdrum by alternating it with quotidian. PerpetuityGrat, normally I don't know why people add what they add. -- Hoary (talk) 06:26, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
haha, I was in no way suggesting you to reduce its usage though. I love the word, too. Kingsacrificer (talk) 07:47, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I made a mistake 5 years ago[edit]
I made a mistake 5 years ago and nuked a page by mistake, but they were able to recover it.
It's been bothering me for a while now that I never gave a proper apology.
Wiki pages are difficult to edit, and it's still difficult to understand how I'm supposed to do that.
I think someone once linked me to a page to the bbcode process or something? I still don't understand what I'm supposed to click on for suggesting edits by looking at the pages. Still seems to be a very live edit process instead of a submission system. AKB769 (talk) 10:24, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Don't sweat it; we have all made mistakes like that, if we have been here a while.
I have just left some helpful links, on your talk page. Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 10:34, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I haven't been here at all despite my account being here, so I feel real guilty about it.
I'm just popping in to try and see if I can understand how to make it work right this time. AKB769 (talk) 10:40, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I nuked a page just yesterday, AKB769. I got polite complaints about this; these persuaded me, so I unnuked it. So far, nobody has called for me to be blocked. ¬∂ Every article has a talk page: if you have an improvement in mind for an article but don't want to implement it yourself, you can suggest it on the talk page. -- Hoary (talk) 10:45, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Okay. I seem to have suggested things on talk pages in the past.
Currently playing with the sandbox, but I'm not really getting that far.
Not quite sure what parts I'm getting wrong. AKB769 (talk) 10:53, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Until you've saved, nobody can view and comment on what you're doing (or getting wrong). Remember that "Publish changes" means 'save', and that you won't save anything till you've clicked "Publish changes". -- Hoary (talk) 11:05, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Tried WP:TUTORIAL? Gr√•bergs Gr√•a S√•ng (talk) 11:10, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@AKB769: It takes seconds to revert an edit so don't worry about it. Thousands of edits are reverted daily. See Help:Reverting for how to do it yourself but you can also ask for help here. You can use the "Show preview" button before saving to check what your edit will look like. If you want to avoid the error you probably made five years ago then check that the content right below your change is still displayed in the preview. I'm one of very few people who has actually managed to accidentally nuke something which could not be recovered but it both required an administrator account and a bug in a feature we no longer use. See also Wikipedia:Village stocks for some screwups made by administrators with tools not available to you. PrimeHunter (talk) 11:27, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
My mistake was made as an anon before I made this account, so someone else was able to fix it by reverting the page.
But, I'm having trouble understanding why the templates aren't working for me in the Sandbox when I use the preview button. AKB769 (talk) 18:46, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Welcome back! Hope you are here to stay¬†:)
--PerpetuityGrat (talk) 19:29, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Thanks! I'm still having trouble understanding how to format things.
The best I can do is play on my sandbox page before finding the talk option on the wiki page to post a wall of things to suggest adding. It covers quite a bit of information, so I'm not sure how to section it off, either.
It also appears that the page itself isn't actually paid much attention to as well, so I dunno how much use I will be if get everything formatted wrong in the first place. AKB769 (talk) 20:46, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
AKB769, I haven't read the content of your sandbox, but a glance at it suggests that it's a draft about a video game, or collection of video games. It comes with 14 references. Every one of these is to the publisher of the game(s). However, articles must be based on reliable sources that are independent of the articles' subjects. -- Hoary (talk) 06:49, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Varda's moon[edit]
Um Can I add some facts in ilmar√´ (Varda's moon)? I added"It's also possibly the Second biggest known irregular moon in the solar system after Proteus which has a diameter of 420 km" That's because Ilmar√´ has a diameter of 403 km but ProEditor changed it because he thought it's unconstructive. I added it because I don't want ilmar√´ to be a forgotten moon, It's rarely talked about despite having a diameter much larger than the famous moon Hyperion. My planet is Homlos (talk) 10:48, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
It seems this was already discussed and resolved on your talk page.
Don't forget, when you add facts, to cite the source(s). Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 11:06, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@My planet is Homlos Looking at [1] (@TheProEditor11, you could have been arsed to use Help:Edit summary, especially with that username), as written, it's just your own musing. Can you find an astronomer who said that and cite them? Gr√•bergs Gr√•a S√•ng (talk) 11:07, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Gr√•bergs Gr√•a S√•ng... Thank you for mentioning me to this discussion... Firstly, I used Twinkle's [vandalism] revert option to revert the edit and it doesn't have an option to give a summary.
The reason I undone his edits are:-
1. [1] Does his edit summary make any sense? There is a clear article on Proteus (moon), yet he linked it with Neptune. He said - he is getting some type of god while trying to link Proteus. LOL!!
2. He doesn't provide any reference to his edits.
3. [2] Now, you people tell me - again, does his edit summary as well as his edit make any sense?
4. [3] He has been warned earlier for doing possible unconstructive editing, though he has resolved the issue with the editor. This again implies that he has a sheer history of adding uncited and unreferenced content to Wiki articles, as well as probably linking it with wrong pages. This creates a confusion among the editors in distinguishing if he has done constructive and helpful edits or has just vandalised the articles he has put his hands on.
I hope I was able to explain the issue... @My planet is Homlos... I understand that MPIH is a new editor and I believe that he will be a great contributor in the future, but he has to learn about "at least" basic Wikipedia policies. He has to provide appropriate edit summary and reliable sources for edits he make.

It makes sense to me but If it doesn't make sense to you, It's OK,I won't cause anymore trouble. I do not want to have somebody doing a YouTube video called"My planet is Homlos is destroying Wikipedia,We must arrest him" I know nothing about Wikipedia,I joined like 6 days ago and I'm not even an adult,I wanted to edit some moons' mass in the list"Planetary-mass moons" because The data in the list was not matched with their individual pages but I didn't provide edit summary so It got reverted by Skywatcher68"unexplained number change" He told me that I needed to provide an edit summary so every edit I do,I will provide edit summary. Then In ilmar√´'s individual page. I think ilmar√´ is the second largest known non-spherical moon because its diameter is literally like 403 km, it's also likely to be non-spherical so it's possible that it's the second largest known non-spherical moon ,Its diameter is bigger than Mimas. The only one bigger than it is Proteus with a diameter of 420 km. Both of them are larger than Mimas but the reason why I put"possible" is because Ilmar√´'s diameter could range from 363 km all the way to 443 km. Why can't I find any sources saying that? It's because Ilmar√´ is too forgotten and nobody talks about it but by logic it's possible that I'm right. And it's also possible that another moon called "Actaea" (Salacia's moon) could be the third largest known non-spherical moon because its diameter is 393 km, surpassing Nereid, Hyperion, Hi'iaka... and many large Non-spherical moons,so It's possibly the third. But again,I can't say that because there's no source talking about this moon,Too forgotten so Even if it's logically right that Ilmar√´ and Actaea is the second and third largest known non-spherical moon in the solar system,I cannot add that fact:( . Also,I had no idea why ilmar√´ and Actaea's so forgotten,Despite their large sizes. I just wanted to add a cool fact but I can't:( But thanks for reading! My planet is Homlos (talk) 04:57, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Also,When I add Proteus,It came out as a god at first,well because it's named after a God,So I changed it to"Neptune | Proteus" because I saw other examples and it's like that but when I clicked into that link, Neptune came out lol My planet is Homlos (talk) 05:28, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
You can always add facts, so long as they're properly sourced, relevant, and you don't edit war anything in. Problem in your case is you didn't make any cite for the fact, you just added it in. It's crucial on Wikipedia to cite supporting material for facts added to an article, not merely assert them.
Also, the series of edits was a bit sloppy: you capitalized "second" and "possibly" and made two links to Proteus, the first to the wrong Proteus, and then to an article that didn't exist. That's less of an issue than the uncited addition (it's Proteus (moon)) but do try and be careful. CoffeeCrumbs (talk) 11:11, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
There's no source talking about that because Ilmar√´ is too forgotten and no one talks about it, But by logic ,Proteus is a non-spherical moon that has a diameter of 420 km,no other non-spherical moons are larger than it, Ilmar√´ is the 2nd with a diameter of 403 km, Which is smaller than Proteus but there's no known moons with a diameter between 420 km and 403 km,so Ilmar√´ is in fact possibly the 2nd largest non-spherical known moon in the solar system. And The 3rd is likely to be Actaea (Salacia's moon) with a diameter of about 393 km,and
there's no known moons with a diameter between 403 km and 393 km,so Actaea is in fact possibly the 3rd largest non-spherical known moon in the solar system. But still, there's no source talking about it because Moons of dwarf planet candidates are too forgotten, sometimes even Proteus is forgotten and some sources just claim that Hyperion is the largest known non-spherical moon in the solar system. By logic, Ilmar√´ is in fact the 2nd largest known non-spherical moon in the solar system. However I can't add that fact? My planet is Homlos (talk) 11:45, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@My planet is Homlos No you can't. Your question is clearly answered above. Shantavira|feed me 12:26, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I Still hope that Ilmar√´ finally gets attention,And eventually some sources says Ilmar√´ is possibly the Second largest non-spherical moon in the solar system,I really do. But too bad I can't say that now. My planet is Homlos (talk) 12:54, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@My planet is Homlos: Hi, I am going to say that Ilmar√´ is not the second biggest moon. What's more important, it's even not a moon but rather ...an Indonesian flower.
Now, other editors need (and Wikipedia readers even more so) to get convinced who of us two is right. As long as you don't reference to any reliable source to support your claim, it's not a bit more valid than mine. That's the essence of why WP:VER is a must. --CiaPan (talk) 12:42, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Ilmar√´ is a moon of Varda(A Trans Neptunian object and a possible dwarf planet),I didn't say that it's the second biggest moon it's the second biggest NON-SPHERICAL moon. My planet is Homlos (talk) 12:51, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
You can search up "ilmar√´,moon of Varda" eventually you will see ilmar√´'s individual page My planet is Homlos (talk) 12:57, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@My planet is Homlos: You are right, of course, that I can search it. But it's your job as a co-author of Wikipedia to reference a reliable source to support the claim you add, not mine as a reader. That is clearly stated several times in WP:VER policy and WP:RS guideline I linked above.

Ok My planet is Homlos (talk) 22:30, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The AI overview in Google said this"No, Ilmar√´ is not larger than Hyperion; Ilmar√´ has a diameter of approximately 403 km, while Hyperion's dimensions are 370 √ó 280 √ó 225 km, making Hyperion's longest dimension larger than Ilmar√´'s entire diameter. " Which doesn't really makes sense but whatever what,I still do want Ilmar√´ to get attention.
This is not a good reply. You don't need to answer, You don't need to care about me My planet is Homlos (talk) 00:42, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
We don't care what Google AI says. LLMs are not a reliable source. Either something is sourced reliably or it doesn't appear on Wikipedia, period. CoffeeCrumbs (talk) 02:45, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I will Def lose lol, Other Editors definitely will say that you are right, even if ilmar√´ is a real moon, I literally joined like 5 days ago,and you joined 20 yrs ago, I was not even born. So you win,But I just want to say that ilmar√´ is the 2nd largest non-spherical moon, It's OK if you don't agree with me, You don't have to argue with me,I don't want a lot of attention¬†:) My planet is Homlos (talk) 13:12, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

@My planet is Homlos: First you said it's "possibly the Second largest non-spherical moon in the solar system", then you said it "is in fact the 2nd largest known non-spherical moon in the solar system". So which of these is true, and how do you know that? Did you read it somewhere? Bazza¬†7 (talk) 13:29, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
By logic it's in fact that,But There are uncertainties because Ilmar√´'s diameter is 403¬±40 so it could be 363km-443 km so that's why I added"possibly" My planet is Homlos (talk) 13:31, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I knew this from Proteus and Ilmar√´'s individual page here in Wikipedia My planet is Homlos (talk) 23:26, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@My planet is Homlos: First, there's no win. Wikipedia is not a battleground (‚ÜíWP:BATTLE), it's an encyclopedia (‚ÜíWP:5P1).
Second, as an encyclopedia, Wikipedia collects and provides well-established knowledge. That means we publish no original research (‚ÜíWP:NOR), everything needs to be based on published (‚ÜíWP:PUBLISHED), reliable (‚ÜíWP:RS), secondary (‚ÜíWP:SECONDARY) sources.
Third, there are exceptions from the second, like routine calculations (‚ÜíWP:CALC). This seems what you did above ‚Äì you took known sizes, you compared them, and you want to publish the conclusion.
Alas ‚Äì this is the fourth important note ‚Äì your input data (sizes of moons) are not exact. What's more, you took them from Wikipedia itself, and Wikipedia is not a reliable source for Wikipedia (‚ÜíWP:NOTSOURCE). That seems surprising, as it was to me, too. However it is deeply based on Wikipedia nature: its articles are written by volunteers, like you and me, who come and go (or sometimes loose interest in some areas). This leads to multiple articles being abandoned and not kept up to date. Additionally, they sometimes are destroyed (‚ÜíWP:VANDAL) and then not repaired due to lack of commited watchers (‚ÜíWP:W). So your calculation, even though done with good intention, qualifies as non-reliable and needs to be discarded as such. I understand it is quite discouraging for new commers, but that's a way of our community to keep the project valuable and reliable for readers ‚Äì Verifiability, not truth (‚ÜíWP:TRUTH). Fifth, and last, I apologize for being a bit ironic or harsh in my comments above. I just didn't notice you are a new editor and have not realized you may not be fluent in our rules yet. Please, don't get discouraged by me! I hope the links I included above will help you to avoid many mistakes in your further contribution here.
Oh, and one more thing: making what you think is good is not a crime at Wikipedia. Just be bold and do (‚ÜíWP:BOLD). If you happen to break some rule, someone will revert your changes and hopefully leave some information what went wrong. Then go to the talk page of the article (‚ÜíWP:TALK) and discuss the problem (please also remember to add a notification to invoved parties (‚ÜíWP:PING) so they don't miss your comments). This is a common Bold‚ÄìRevert‚ÄìDiscuss cycle which (‚ÜíWP:BRD) which helps editors to convert misunderstandings into agreement and cooperation. --CiaPan (talk) 10:36, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Yeah I'm not even fluent in English,Let alone the rules in Wikipedia... Thx for the reply,but I think in ilmar√´'s individual page,The diameter of it has a reliable source. It's Ok Polish guy:) I'm not discouraged. I joined Wikipedia because I'm really interested in space and I'm a planetballs guy, I'm interested in their characteristics but some of them's mass looked kinda wrong so I changed some of them,and most of their diameters has a source in their individual pages.
Also,A decent amount of people think that editing Wikipedia is now my full time job, But It's not,I still have to go to school. My planet is Homlos (talk) 13:05, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Redirects only[edit]
I was trying to use this tool to check on all the redirects that I have ever created. It failed when I tried to load. I know that I've created probably at least 20,000 redirects, so it likely was going to take a while, but I cannot get the link to work.

@Iljhgtn Since you have create hardly any new articles, only redirects, you can just use Special:Contributions to find them. I limited User contributions for Iljhgtn by looking only for new pages in mainspace for a recent few months but from that you should see how to find them all. Or you could start with Iljhgtn - Wikipedia (en.wikipedia.org) - Edit Counter - XTools which includes a link to the 29,610 pages created but I assume that link is the one you can't get to work.

How to place a new listing[edit]
What is meant by a "license."
I want to talk/write about my restaurant in NYC to correct incorrect information that somebody has posted about it.
I want to put a padlock on my writing so it can't be ambushed.
I want to be able to type without having all the geek symbols I don't understand at age 86.
I will pay for assistance if someone would individually help me step by step.
Is that possible? YodelandEcho (talk) 22:04, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
You have a conflict of interest with FOOD (New York City restaurant) and you need to declare that on your user page.
There is absolutely no way we would protect an article so that only a person with a conflict of interest can edit it, and this is technically impossible anyway. The protection levels are tied to the editor type, such as preventing new editors from editing, or preventing anyone but experienced editors or administrators from editing.
Because you have a conflict of interest, you should not be making any substantive changes to the article. Use the WP:Edit Request Wizard to propose changes on the talk page instead. You can make minor fixes to typos, names, numbers, and dates. You can revert obvious vandalism. You can add citations to sources independent of you. Anything more substantive, however, you should propose on the talk page.
Assistance is free. Just use WP:Edit Request Wizard to propose changes you want to make. ~Anachronist (talk) 22:35, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
YodelandEcho Now that you have publicly stated you would be willing to pay someone, you may get solicitations from scammers who monitor this page. Do not give anyone your hard earned money. See WP:SCAM. 331dot (talk) 22:49, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hi there! thanks for your interest in the project! Around here, we don't necessarily want the truth, we want what's verifiable. So, if some bit of information is inaccurate, the only way to change it is by finding a reliable third party source that contains that information. We also don't care about what the subject of the article has said about themselves, as that is unreliable (for example, say there's a person very obviously guilty of a crime. If they insist they aren't guilty, we wouldn't automatically take their word as fact unless there's good evidence they were wrongly convicted). If you'd still like to contribute, there is a visual editor that is similar to programs like Microsoft Word or LibreOffice Writer. Do note that if you have any connection to the restaurant you shouldn't edit the article as you'd have a conflict of interest and that makes it very difficult to write neutrally about the subject even if you think you can. I hope you understand that all these rules are here for a reason and ensure Wikipedia is a reliable source of information, even if they may seem a bit silly at times mgjertson (talk) (contribs) 02:01, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Hello, @ÁçÖÁú†Ê¥û, and welcome to the Teahouse.
I'm afraid that it doesn't work that way. One of the principal goals of Wikimedia projects is to provide a resource that anybody can reuse for any purpose, and so most of its content, including most images, must be available for anybody to reuse - either in the public domain, or licensed by the copyright holder in a way that permits free use.
Because it is often difficult to find images that meet these requirements, English Wikipedia (though not all language
Wikipedias) permits non-free content in certain circumstances. But I'm afraid that adding an image to a list article will never allow that.
Please see Image use policy for more information. ColinFine (talk) 11:45, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Pedioplanis husabensis[edit]
Pedioplanis husabensis
Good morning!
I am kindly asking for support with this page. I am obviously too old to get to grips with the procedure of contributing "properly"
Here is my request:
In the early 1980's I worked as a curator for reptiles and amphibians at the then State Museum Windhoek in South West Africa/Namibia.
In the course of an ecological survey of the R√∂ssing Uranium Mine I discovered a still undescribed Lizard which I described - together with my friend Werner Mayer (deceased 2015) - as the new species "Pedioplanis husabensis.
The publication was called
"On the parapatric existence of two species of the Pedioplanis undata group (Reptilia: Sauria: Lacertidae) in the central Namib desert (Southwest Africa) with description of the new species Pedioplanis husabensis"
It is available online: https://www.zobodat.at/pdf/HER_1_3_4_0083-0095.pdf
This reference is currently placed under "further reading". I'd like to move the link & text from "further reading" to "reference N¬∞ 1 since I feel that the original publication should be the primary reference to the species.
Apart from this request, I can deliver valuable information about distribution and diagnostic features.
Here is a link to a rather precise *.kmz file which shows the distribution map on Google Earth:

I agree that the work should be cited as a reference; for technical reasons it can't be listed first (the order is that in which they are used in the article, and has no deeper significance); and have done so.

Latest sport games in infoboxes[edit]
Pages like India national cricket team and Pakistan national cricket team, and I am assuming the rest, too, have the last games played in every format mentioned in the infobox.
Given the frequency with which these teams play, is there really a point in us keeping a track of every single match and making an edit every few days to this? I don't feel it is very encyclopaedic.
I want to propose exclusion of the latest games played by an active sports team from the infobox.

Help Me See Edit Revert As Good Faith[edit]
A one-sentence edit I made last week was reverted. This is the first time a revert has happened to me. Reading WP:RV and WP:ROWN, it did not seem to me that a revert was warranted.
I started a discussion on the talk page: Talk:TESCREAL#Considering RfC regarding sentence about the origin Three other editors (not the one who did the revert) have replied, very briefly, to my lengthy explanation of my edit. I am having trouble seeing the revert as having been done in good faith, and these replies have not helped. Can someone please help me see it that way? Perhaps if someone who understands their POV restates it a bit less tersely, I will get it. Aurodea108 (talk) 19:09, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hello, @Aurodea108. As I can't see why you think the edit was in bad faith, I'm not sure that I can help you to not see it that way, but I'll stick my twopennyworth in.
A Wikipedia article should be a summary of what the sources say about the subject, not what you (or I, or other editors) know, think, or believe about the subject.
If a source does not directly say anything about the subject (specifically) then it is hard to see why that source should be cited, or what can relevantly go into the article on the basis of that source. If the source does not specifically say that it is about the origin of TESCREAL, then it cannot be used to support a statement about the origin of TESCREAL.
I also suggest that if several editors disagree with you then it's time to drop the stick. ColinFine (talk) 19:59, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Thank you @ColinFine for taking the time to reply to me extensively.
I take it you have already read completely the posts I made in that discussion thread, for which I also thank you.
The source grouped the TESCREAL paper among several earlier papers, which it described as seeing AI in a certain way.
If I understand you correctly, in order for the source to be relevant, it would have had to say explicitly something like, "First Kalluri wrote that AI may 'build systems that sanctify the status quo and advance the interests of the powerful', then Birhane and Guest wrote...then...and most recently, Gebru and Torres came up with the acronym TESCREAL to describe the ideologies they see as underpinning AI. These are
some of the authors that see ‚ÄòAI‚Äô as a way to advance capitalist, kyriarchal, authoritarian and/or white supremacist goals." The source said this succinctly, expecting the reader to be able to follow the references and unpack their clause into something like what I just wrote, rather than explicitly. Hence the source did not explicitly use the word "TESCREAL" and is being seen by you and others as not relevant.
If indeed I am understanding you correctly, then I would respond that the hypothetical passage I just wrote is more like what a good professor might write for their lower-division undergraduate students, and is not to be expected in a research-level academic paper.
The unpacking that I just did is almost a mechanical exercise, and should not change the answer to whether the source is relevant or not.
Part of the reason I am wondering about bad faith is what I am seeing as nitpicking about a stylistic choice on the part of the source.
Part of my reason for wondering about bad faith is admittedly due to the history of that page, some of which can be seen at the Talk page (some has been archived). It seems to me that my sentence, which is about a "meta" question (where did the idea of TESCREAL come from?) may have been reverted because other, less "meta", questions (does TESCREAL describe a real phenomenon? should TESCREAL be described on WP?) are contentious.
As for whether to "drop the stick", I will keep your suggestion in mind and give it some time. Aurodea108 (talk) 22:11, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
No, @Aurodea108, I haven't closely read the posts. I (and I think the other editors) are arguing on the basis of Wikipedia policy. If it is not discussed in one of the sources, it should not be discussed in the article. Period. ColinFine (talk) 22:22, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I've read through the discussion, and broadly agree with the other editors. I see zero evidence of bad faith in the replies, and I would echo ColinFine's note and argue that it would be a good idea for you to drop the stick. You introduced a source, several others have disagreed about its relevance, and part of functioning in Wikipedia is for one to recognize that consensus will frequently be against their own opinion.

Request for help on new article I have been working on[edit]
Hello,
I am the subject of the draft Draft:David de Haro Malo de Molina, so I have a declared conflict of interest.
I would appreciate if neutral editors could review the draft and provide feedback on its neutrality, sources, and notability. I have already included some reliable references.
Thank you very much for your time and support. Dharo76 (talk) 20:57, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

== redirects to replace red links
Creating redirects to replace red links on talk pages and replacing speedy deletion tags
A veteran editor red linked something on a talk page (relevant rev here). He then subsequently created a redirect to have that red link redirect to a related article (redirect creation here). I let the user know that I thought a piped link was more appropriate since I didn't think the redirect made much sense, especially because it was created solely for a talk page mention. It makes it more difficult to find an article with a very similar name (The Transgender Issue) which seems to me to be reason #1 for WP:RDEL. The user agreed, replaced the link with a piped link and then effectively blanked the redirect page (here), requesting speedy deletion. I wasn't sure what to do at that point because the user seemingly forgot to add a speedy deletion template. Another user added a speedy deletion template (here). This template was subsequently removed by another user to turn the old redirect page into a disambiguation page.
My questions are:
Is it common practice to create borderline arbitrary redirect pages in order to remove red links on talk pages? (as the creator claimed they had been doing for 1/4 century)
Are you allowed to remove a speedy deletion tag if you weren't the one who placed it?
EDIT: I read up on the second one. Per the deletion policy: Anyone except a page's creator may contest the speedy deletion of a page by removing the deletion notice from the page. 23:16, 14 September 2025 (UTC)
quidama talk 22:57, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Quidama: Redirects that you are talking about are in article space, and so should serve an encyclopedic service. But each one should be considered on its merit. Speedy delete criterion template:R3 may apply, or WP:RFD if it needs a discussion. Graeme Bartlett (talk) 23:55, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Best practice for size of edits[edit]
When an article needs heavy editing, is it better to do several small edits or one big edit? Also if you plan on editing very different parts of a page, such as tables, lists, and text, is it better to focus on only one per edit? I was wondering if small edits make reverting easier, because the good edits don‚Äôt have to be reverted along with the bad one. BrightPinkBirb (talk) 23:37, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
If you are uncertain as to whether your edit needs to be reverted, perhaps you should use the preview function. For an article that is very active, then smaller edits are better to avoid an edit conflict. Also for a controversial article, small edits are better in case of explanation required or disagreement. Also consider if your browser saves your editing. If you do a long big edit and the power goes off, or Wikipedia goes into maintenance mode or something crashes, you don't want to lose your work. Perhaps adding one section or paragraph at a time for inactive articles is a good compromise against losing your work. Graeme Bartlett (talk) 00:02, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Alternatively, if your making huge edits, you may wish to do it in your sandbox, or to put it off-wiki altogether (such as Google Docs or notepad) before implementing it to the article. Google Docs should automatically save your work, provided you have an internet connection. This doesn't really work for articles that currently receive more than several edits per day, such as the Charlie Kirk situation. If there's any disagreement with your changes to the article, the talk page is the way to go, as per the dispute resolution. JuniperChill (talk) 17:04, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
This is nothing but my opinion: I think it's not the character count but how the material fits together, and if you're in a position to be wondering about this, I think the answer is probably "so that it all belongs together, and anyone reverting it would want to revert all of it together".
I don't think this answer applies to things like going through a badly spelled article and just fixing uncontroversial spelling mistakes. Nobody should want to revert that anyway. TooManyFingers (talk) 20:58, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Editing User Page[edit]
How can I edit my user page? PBGen Andre Perez Dizon 1994 (talk) 23:58, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@PBGen Andre Perez Dizon 1994: You have already been editing your user page. However I would ask you, are you making an article draft? If so you should use your sandbox User:PBGen Andre Perez Dizon 1994/sandbox. And the tone is not encyclopedic. If this is about you, please read WP:Autobiography. And if it is not an article, but supposed to be your WP:Userpage, then the content is far too excessive, and you should concentrate on improving Wikipedia by editing other pages first.

This submission does not appear to be written in the formal tone expected of an encyclopedia article.

The tone in which it's written, OlleborLeumas, is of minor concern compared with notability. (That is, "notability" as defined by and for Wikipedia.)

What do I do in this situation?[edit]
the noisiest and ugliest background humanly possible?
I noticed that this Revision by
Smuckola had a rude edit summary, and I want to template them (couldn't find their pronouns sorry smuckola) with Template:Uw-bes1, but I'm worried that since I rarely edit, (not even autoconfirmed yet, but I will be someday) I might not have the authority/knowledge to do so. (even though I've read WP:CIVIL and am fairly certain that their edit summary was uncivil in ways covered in two different parts (specifically in the part on edit summaries, and the general section on identifying incivility)) What do I do? Zonedbaser (talk) 02:15, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
In general, the first thing you do is discuss it with the other editor. But I think calling this incivility is a massive stretch, in my opinion. CoffeeCrumbs (talk) 02:30, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Thanks for the advice, but if you don't mind me asking, how do you see it as a stretch, because when I look at it, I see insults towards the photo as the main meat of the summary. ("wrongheaded photo that should've never been shot", "noisiest and ugliest background humanly possible") Am I taking policy too literally? (though, the second example of covering in policy was a bit of a stretch i admit) Zonedbaser (talk) 02:42, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
IMO "The whole point was to illustrate color, so they shot it in the noisiest and ugliest background humanly possible, making blue look green." is hyperbolic, and too close to calling the photographer (who hasn't edited since 2022) an idiot, and a little disappointing coming from an editor who's been here 16 years. It's a pic of a glass of soda on an ordinary table, and it certainly looks blue to me. Fwiw, it's used on several WP:s. However, if this was at WP:ANI (where problems of behavior are discussed), it wouldn't go anywhere unless it was part of a long history of uncivility. Gr√•bergs Gr√•a S√•ng (talk) 05:31, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The civility rule is to comment on content, not contributors. That edit summary was a comment on content. I don't see the rude language crossing the line into incivility. It's just uncivilized, not incivil. ~Anachronist (talk) 06:22, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Question about using the # sign[edit]
Hi everyone,
I‚Äôm a new editor and cannot find a clear answer to this:
Can the # sign be used in an actor‚Äôs filmography?
The actor's official credit in the film is ‚ÄòSoldier #1‚Äô, but I have been told that it goes against Wikipedia:Manual of Style and that the credit should be listed as ‚ÄòSoldier No. 1‚Äô. Shouldn't credits be listed accurately on an actor‚Äôs filmography, or is there no exception to this rule?
Many thanks! NicR77 (talk) 02:38, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
What is the actor's name? MahmoudAbbasAlDilfti (talk) 03:29, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Craig Parker NicR77 (talk) 03:38, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
the Wikipedia article on "A Soldier's Sweetheart", which is the movie where Parker acted as Soldier #/no. 1, lists in the "Cast" section as "Soldier no. 2 (Tony Billy)", so maybe it's better to keep the "no." format for consistency.
I still do not know what part of the Manual of Style that sets the standard for this.
- MahmoudAbbasAlDilfti (talk) 04:10, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Thank you for your response. If you look at the revision history on A Soldier's Sweetheart, that was just recently changed by the user that I have been having a disagreement with. Since Craig Parker‚Äôs Wikipedia article was created his credit has been listed as ‚ÄúSoldier #1‚Äù (until only recently). His credit is listed as Solider #1 on both IMDb https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0129414/
and on TV Guide https://www.tvguide.com/movies/a-soldiers-sweetheart/cast/2030012091/. Thanks again for your time! NicR77 (talk) 04:31, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
If you find out how he is actually credited in the film itself, not on a website like IMDB, then that would be the appropriate way to describe the role in our article. ~Anachronist (talk) 06:24, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The "#" policy is MOS:NUMBERSIGN, Avoid using the # symbol when referring to numbers.
In your case, I think the more specific policies are MOS:FILMCAST and MOS:TVCAST, which say Names should be referred to as credited, or by common name supported by a reliable source. [...] For uncredited roles, a citation should be provided in accordance with Wikipedia's verifiability policy. Do not use IMDb as a reference, as it is considered unreliable.
Since MOS:FILMCAST and MOS:TVCAST have a more specific focus, they would take precedence. Blepbob (talk) 06:55, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Thank you! Previously, I had provided a WP:RS via TV Guide to support this but another user kept reverting my edit saying it went against WP:MOS. How should I respond if this happens again? NicR77 (talk) 08:32, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The recommended strategy is "BOLD, revert, discuss":
Bold - Start off by making the edits you want.
Revert - You can revert other people's edits, so long as you aren't edit warring. Other people can also revert yours. Provide explanations in your edit summaries.
Discuss - If there's a lot of reverting, all disagreeing editors should stop reverting and take it to that article's WP:talk page. Let uninvolved editors weigh in. Try to reach an agreement.
If you revert twice, then you are no longer following the BRD cycle: If your reversion is reverted, then there may be a good reason for it. Go to the talk page to learn why you were reverted. Blepbob (talk) 14:47, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
If that doesn't help, WP:DISCFAIL is one of the few essays providing good advice. ~ ToBeFree (talk) 15:51, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Judge Morris Miller article[edit]
I am trying to get a new article accepted, a biography. The first couple of reviewers said i should fix the reference citations. I did that. Then I was struggling to delete the photo I had uploaded and replace it with another. Then all of a sudden a new reviewer said the person was not notable and seemed to reject it.
I had cited two articles about the subject from Washington DC newspapers.
There are many more news articles from those years in the 1960s which would make it clear that he was notable and would show significant coverage, not just passing mentions.
Now what do I do? You'll find it with my user name Equusreserve for Morris Miller. Equusreserve (talk) 06:25, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hello, Equusreserve. Your draft has not been rejected and the words rejected appears nowhere in the notice you received. It has instead been declined and you are invited to resubmit it after you have improved it, addressing the specific issues identified by the reviewer. Adding more references to reliable, independent sources that devote significant coverage to this person is the best way to do that. If your draft was rejected, that would be the end of the line.

Equusreserve, the point is that you were not told "no", you were told "not yet". Does that help? DS (talk) 12:21, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Equusreserve You now have plenty of sources if they cover various aspects of Miller's life. At present, you used all but one of them to verify the fact that he was appointed as a judge. We only need one reliable source to do that. However, we need sources to confirm that he was frequently consulted on housing policy and others to confirm his marriage and the names of his children. Usually, for privacy reasons, Wikipedia articles only mention by name notable children (i.e. those two that already have articles in Wikipedia) but, again, we need inline citations which confirm these details. I don't doubt that Miller is notable but your draft needs to be written in such a way that this is more clear. Reading the policy on biographies of living people may help, even though Miller is deceased. Mike Turnbull (talk) 13:21, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Publishing English page[edit]
Hi,
I have written a Norwegian Wikipedia article about the artist Peter Lodwick: no:Peter Lodwick. This was published on my first attempt without any issues.
As he is a British artist, I would now like to create an English version of the article. In the past, before the Norwegian page was approved, I had trouble getting the English draft accepted ‚Äî reasons included questions about notability, incorrect citations, etc.
My question is: since the Norwegian version was approved immediately, can I simply translate the article (including sources, references, pictures, and layout) to English, or should it be written differently? Are there any particular considerations or best practices I should keep in mind?
Also, I cannot find my earlier English draft in the sandbox. Is it fine to simply create a new draft in my sandbox and later decide which Wikipedia language edition (English, Norwegian, etc.) I want to publish it to? Or how do I proceed?
Thanks in advance for your advice!
BR,
May MaySundAnd (talk) 09:02, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hello and welcome.
The Norwegian Wikipedia is a separate project, with its own editors and policies. What is acceptable there is not necessarily acceptable here.
The English Wikipedia tends to be stricter than others.
Its up to the translator to make sure that the article they are translating meets the requirements of the Wikipedia for which they are translating. If you do not have much experience having English drafts accepted, it is highly recommended that you use the Articles for Creation process.
Before today, you had not edited the English Wikipedia since 2023.
If you thought you did, your edits were not saved, or were made while logged out.
Note that "publish changes" should be understood to mean "save", so if you did not click Publish Changes, your edits were not saved. Your sandbox has a Norwegian draft in it. 331dot (talk) 09:14, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

@MaySundAnd Some guidance at Help:Translation, and you should look at the WP:BLP policy, which is important. At a glance I see some issues (from the en-WP pov): The biography section is mostly uncited, that won't fly on en-WP, and one of your refs is en.everybodywiki.com, not good enough, especially not in an article about a living person. And if you don't have an acceptable ref for the DOB, remove it. The picture looks suspiciously good, but I see on Commons it's ok (we can use it). Hope this helps some.

Hello, @Barry Hart. On their user page, @HRShami says they "work with", LustrePR, they have certainly successfully created a number of articles (they claim 900, but I haven't checked), and for the one such article I have looked at they have complied with the Terms of Use by declaring (on the article's talk page) who they were paid by to create it.
So, while they are in no way official or endorsed by the Wikimedia Foundation, it appears that they comply with the terms of use, and have a track record of successfully creating articles. ColinFine (talk) 14:59, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

I don't really see the kind of sourcing that I like to see in the articles I'm familiar with, but rather than declining it I'll leave it for the next person, who may be a better judge of the sources you cite. Drmies (talk) 22:03, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Ion[edit]
I want to modify slightly pages ION, CONDUCTIVITY, IONS ASSOCIATION etc
by adding recent studies on ionization in non-polar liquids. There are many studies that follow Onsager, Fuoss work showing that addition of amphiphilic substances to non polar liquids creates ions. They are solvated by neutral molecules of solute, not solvent as in water. This is field of non-aqueous electrochemistry that is completely ommited from the said papers.

Hi @AndreiDukhin. Please don't share your personal email address: this is a public forum. You are free to edit those articles. You have nearly 1,000 edits already, so I am unsure what specific help you need? qcne (talk) 19:07, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hello, @AndreiDukhin. As qcne says, you are welcome to edit the articles, but please take note of the following first:
You should read Verifiability and original research. If you are adding information from reliable sources, please cite those sources - see WP:REFB. (Added: you should only add information from reliable sources)
If any of the work or the sources that you want to cite is your own work, then that is regarded as a conflict of interest, and you should not edit the articles directly, but should instead raise edit requests on the articles' talk pages, so somebody uninvolved can consider your request.
I have no idea whether or not the material you want to add might be controversial; but it does often happen that editors disagree about what should be in an article. I suggest you also get familiar with WP:BRD, which explains how we (try to) reach consensus.

question about new editor view for desktop website[edit]
is there a way to use the new visual editor on user talk pages or can you only use the plain text one? Xboxfan38 (talk) 19:04, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Xboxfan38: there are a few hacky ways to enable the visual editor on anything that uses the wikitext Content model. As an example, here it is on your talkpage . You can change the title URL parameter on that link to get a different page. Victor Schmidt (talk) 19:18, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Yes, you can use Visual Editor on user talk pages when in desktop mode. Simply change the &action=edit to &veaction=edit, like so: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Xboxfan38&veaction=edit Rotideypoc41352 (talk ¬∑ contribs) 19:15, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
inserting different page numbers in uniform footnotes[edit]
In Samuel Butler (novelist), n.5 appears seven times, as "a" through "g". The quotation in the text attached to "a" is on page 16 of the cited book. The quotation in the text attached to "g" is on pages 6-7 of the cited book. (I will look for "b" through "f" when I have a chance.) How do I enter separate page numbers in the different appearances of n.5? Maurice Magnus (talk) 19:07, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hello, @Maurice Magnus, and welcome to the Teahouse.
Help:References and page numbers gives various ways to handle this. ColinFine (talk) 20:11, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Thanks. I remembered that I once did this for another article. I looked at that article, thinking that I'd use the technique I'd used in it. It worked for "g". I inserted {{ rp | 6-7 }}.(Ignore the spaces; I added them so that it would not come out as [1]:‚Ää6‚Äì7‚Ää) But I couldn't use that technique for "a," because "a", being the first appearance of n.5, has a different format, spelling out the whole footnote.

Maurice Magnus, it seems a little strange to worry about page numbers for something described as vaguely as "Clara G. Stillman, Samuel Butler: A Mid-Victorian Modern". Edition (if not the first), "location" (place), publisher, year, ISBN? Add such detail to whichever one of a‚Äìg contains any detail beyond "name". Then add Template:Rp in exactly the same way (aside from altering the page number(s), of course) to each of a‚Äìg. So you'll have something like <ref name="stillman">[bibliographic detail]</ref>{{Rp|26}} for one and <ref name="stillman" />{{Rp|93‚Äì95}} for each of the others. -- Hoary (talk) 23:07, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The details about Stillman's book are listed under "Further reading." Maurice Magnus (talk) 01:21, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Maurice Magnus It is best to put the full details into the reference section using named references, as discussed above, then remove that book from "Further reading" as it is now part of the main body of the article and doesn't need to be duplicated there.

Standardize image size in infobox[edit]
Hi, I'm a new editor and I had a question on how I could standard the size of the blade images for the draft I'm working on. I have two blade SVG's I made that are in the infobox, and the men's blade SVG is noticeably smaller than the woman's blade even though I used the same Wikipedia commons SVG as a base for both.
Is there a way to standardize the size for the two images or at least make one match the other? Here is the draft that I'm talking about. Thanks, Pixzzl. Pixzzl (talk) 21:44, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Would it work to merge the two SVGs into one, so that they're both there but as top and bottom of one picture? TooManyFingers (talk) 21:53, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I could try to do that, but creating them with Inkscape was hard enough on it's own and I honestly don't know how to merge them. Is there no way to just set the size for them? Pixzzl (talk) 21:59, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Pixzzl According to the documentation at {{Infobox rowing club}}, the image parameter is supposed to be used for a picture of the clubhouse/boathouse, not as a way to force in a second blade image. I suspect that's why your two images are coming out at different default sizes. Maybe the solution would be to place one blade image only in the infobox and put the second one as a thumb image within the main text. If you want to add both as a single blade image, as suggested above, then that should be easy using Inkscape and I'll help if you ask via my talk page. Mike Turnbull (talk) 10:34, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Ah, okay. I can do this. Later today if I send a message on your talk page would you be able to help me? Thanks, Pixzzl. Pixzzl (talk) 12:06, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Pixzzl I've done the merged file, which would probably be best if uploaded to Commons by you, as it is based on your originals. You don't seem to have set an email address for your account. If you do that, I'll email the .svg to you. I won't see what your address is unless you reply to my own message. Mike Turnbull (talk) 13:30, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
why allow paid editing?[edit]
hello! I have a question. why is it that wikipedia permits paid editing to occur at all? right now, paid editors have to declare their COI, which is nice, but to me at least it would make more sense to ban paid editing entirely. given all of the scams, and wasted time, and useless questions, and disruptive editors, I think it would be better to make paid editing and COI editing against wikipedia policy. after all, wikimedia doesn't get compensated for paid editing work or anything. of course, I'm not demanding this decades-old policy be changed immediately. I'm just genuinely curious. that's all. thanks! 67.218.119.178 (talk) 22:12, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The consensus of the Wikipedia community has been that if we were to ban paid editing, the paid editors would probably still edit here but would not admit it and thus be more difficult to regulate. MrOllie (talk) 22:20, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
We highly discourage paid editors from editing articles directly. Some of them have useful suggestions, and as for the rest: I expect that people are more likely to comply with disclosure and editing requirements than to respect a strict ban. And given that our scam warning hasn't kept scammers from promising they can publish and protect articles (or alternatively threaten to delete them, as blackmail), I doubt announcing a strict ban would affect them much either. jlwoodwa (talk) 22:24, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I hadn't known that we have paid editors. If they are discouraged from editing articles directly, then what do they edit? I'm just curious; I have no interest in being one. Maurice Magnus (talk) 22:57, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
For existing articles, they can edit talk pages and make edit requests; for new articles, they can create them in draftspace and submit them to Articles for creation. jlwoodwa (talk) 23:00, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Hello, @BonkoSupreme, and welcome to the Teahouse.
I don't wish to appear hostile, but we keep seeing this: people who take money to do a job they do not (yet) have the skills to do, and expect us unpaid volunteers to help them earn their money.
My earnest advice to new editors is to not even think about
trying to create an article until you have spent several weeks - at least - learning about how Wikipedia works by making improvements to existing articles. Once you have understood core policies such as verifiability, neutral point of view, reliable, independent sources, and notability, and experienced how we handle disagreements with other editors (the Bold, Revert, Discuss cycle), then you might be ready to read your first article carefully, and try creating a draft. If you don't follow this advice but try to create an article without this preparation, you are likely to have a frustrating and disappointing experience with Wikipedia.
I would say that this is more important for paid editors than for others. ColinFine (talk) 09:40, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Draft:All the President's Elephants (Film)[edit]
Revisions by Louiskk23 to Draft:All the President's Elephants (Film)
Hi everyone, I am not a regular Wikipedia creator/editor. I drafted this page after being so impressed by this documentary. I'm now concerned about the amount of editing (-10,000, then + 2,000) just done to my draft All the President's Elephants (Film) submission. This below is what I've now written on the Talk Page of this article, and am repeating it here (Not sure which is the right thing to do.) ------ Are there experienced people who can review this please?
14 Sept revisions by Louiskk23 to Draft:All the President's Elephants (Film)
[edit source]
Thank you for your input Louiskk23. Having read 3 of her elephant memoirs and also watched this documentary several times, I feel like changing the wording here to say that Sharon Pincott simply had a "close" relationship with the elephants doesn't capture just how close a relationship she actually had with them. In the documentary she actually kisses (more than once) a huge wild adult elephant ‚Äì not hand-raised, not one in fenced areas. Family groups also come to her when she calls to them. I feel that this is much more than simply having a ‚Äúclose‚Äù relationship with these elephants. As this article indicated previously, it has been said by numerous world-wide reviewers that she had one of the most remarkable relationships with elephants anywhere in the world. Hence, I do think it‚Äôs fair to say her relationship with the elephants was at least ‚Äúextremely close‚Äù. Re the taking out the comparisons to Dian Fossey and Jane Goodall etc I wonder how necessary this is, since it does help to show why the documentary has been so successful, and what an interesting subject she is ‚Äì although I‚Äôve made no changes to these edits. Does anyone have any comments/suggestions re these last edits? WikiAdd01 (talk) 00:39, 16 September 2025 (UTC) WikiAdd01 (talk) 09:40, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Something extra - I feel that there is other relevant/interesting information that has also now been removed, shortening the article, and the references, substantially. WikiAdd01 (talk) 09:48, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hello, I hope you are well. Before stating my point, I would like to say that I have nothing against your article or you personally. On the contrary, I found the subject of the documentary very interesting. Although I agree that my editing was drastic, I modified text that I felt was excessive and contained unnecessary praise. as well as being redundant. What I did was try to make the article more neutral so that the format would better comply with Wikipedia guidelines and thus support its approval. If you look, two experienced editors edited your article after this, one of them removed a large part of the article that, in my opinion, was unnecessary and not very neutral. Furthermore, another editor commented that there is no mention of the documentary in two references you added. Similarly, I promise not to edit that draft anymore, but instead to let the more experienced editors do what they think is best.
I would also like to say that I have been suffering what I consider to be ‚Äúharassment‚Äù from the editor Celjski Grad. At first, I made a mistake and the problem was solved on the librarians' board by clarifying the confusion, but since then I can't make any edits without Celjski Grad harassing me. Even when I corrected simple spelling mistakes, he harassed me and wrote to me. When I make edits in my sandbox, he harasses me. When I improve syntax, he writes to me too. Although I agree that the edit to the documentary was drastic, the other edits were simpler. In fact, I had to write the text and modify it in a Word file instead of in my sandbox because I was afraid that the user Celjski Grad would also complain about me editing in my sandbox, so I thought, ‚ÄúIf I do it in a separate notepad and then paste my edit without using my sandbox, the user will probably be calmer.‚Äù But even that didn't save me from harassment by this user. I had already made my last edits in a Word file, which is why it seemed like I did them ‚Äúquickly.‚Äù Louiskk23 (talk) 18:04, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

@Valentinfenk There are many messages on your talk page explaining the situation. As you say, you are a paid editor and under Wikimedia terms and conditions you must disclose that on your user page and subsequently only edit the article via its talk page so that neutral editors without a conflict of interest can assess them. All edit suggestions must include reliable sources so that readers can verify what is stated. Mike Turnbull (talk) 13:04, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hello, @Valentinfenk. To add to what Mike said: please note that Wikipedia has little interest in what the subject of an article says or wants to say about themselves, or what their associates say about them. Wikipedia is almost exclusively interested in what people who have no connection with the subject, and who have not been prompted or fed information on behalf of the subject, have chosen to publish about the subject in reliable sources. If enough material is cited from independent sources to establish notability, a limited amount of uncontroversial factual information may be added from non-independent sources.
Also, please read about edit warring, because that is what you have been doing. ColinFine (talk) 13:25, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Draft :Shaheed Shashi Prasad Singh[edit]
draft:Shashi Prasad Singh
My first article have been declined thrice. The grounds have been changing and i have been consistently improving my work as this is a story about unsung heroes of indian independence covered exponentially but not accessible for general public.
Can anyone help me know what else could be the reason for this decline . Presently it is under review Praj9289 (talk) 15:53, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hello, Praj9289. Often, a draft will have multiple problems and various reviewers will emphasize different reasons in their decline notices. This is normal and should not be a concern. You should substantively address the comments of each of the reviewers by improving the draft accordingly. The phrase "unsung heroes" that you use raises concerns, as "unsung" can be interpreted as a synonym for "not notable and therefore not eligible for a Wikipedia article". Your references do not make it easy to verify the content. For example, the URL in your reference to the multi-volume Dictionary of Martyrs: India's Freedom Struggle leads to the cover page for volume 4 rather to the pages actually about the subject of your draft. You need to structure your draft in such a way that a reviewer can verify that this person has been the subject of significant coverage in reliable sources that are entirely independent of him. His son discussing him in the preface of a book is clearly not an independent source. Another problem are the assertions that he is notable because of his leadership role in various organizations such as the Panchayati Raksha Gram Seva Dal. And yet there is no Wikipedia article about the Panchayati Raksha Gram Seva Dal, and no reference to a reliable source assessing this group. How is the reviewer or any reader able to assess the significance of this group on their own? Was it an influential mass organization active for years, or a small, temporary committee? Or something else. So, I believe that your draft still needs a lot of work. Cullen328 (talk) 16:47, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
There is a whole government website over gran raksha dal https://dalpatigramrakshadalmahasangh.com/member-new.php
Secondly, the page no for Dictionary of Martyr is mentioned in the reference i cannot create a link to the exact page number althought i have mentioned it in the reference.
His son was the hugher education minister, He held office of public importance hence making his statements more than just a son's statement .
But unsung heroes is said because they are unsung because of their untimely death. Not because the did not get enough coverage or notability Praj9289 (talk) 16:58, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
also if would be kind of you if you can guide me over the fact that if i am mentioning names of certain people who are of national importance like the first oresident of our country how do i get a link on his name.. or if i am mentioning quit india movement how do i get a link so that people could click on it and directly visit the wikipedia page for that event for ex quit india movement Praj9289 (talk) 17:02, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

coordinating edits across multiple articles[edit]
I only recently go into editing and am still somewhat inexperienced with online encyclopedia, but more importantly online fora in general. I had been reading and editing on a small scale for a while, but perhaps got out of my depth when I fixed an issue on a historical topic. I'm sure that any student of history knows that seemingly small and innocous discussions about words can turn out to be longstanding political disputes when looked at more closely.
Please bear with me for the wall of text that follows.
I noticed recently that lots of pages related to Albanian history had the same bizarre mistake. I soon found out why: the page Italian protectorate over Albania was supposed to cover a part of World War I, but after a user changed this earlier this year, it was now a redirect page to Treaties of Tirana, a not unrelated but different topic covering a part of the interwar period.
I found out using the "What Links here" feature that ca. 500 pages used the former page to provide further information on WW1, instead providing information on the interwar period for no apparent reason.
(It is at this point that I have to ask whether it breaks etiquette to talk about a user without formally Mentioning them. I don't want to annoy them, as this is about me asking advice and not wanting to criticise them. Their username is Barjimoa.)
After I noticed this, I was unsure what to do.
Rolling back the change would have fixed the confusion, but I wanted to see whether there was perhaps a reason for this change, in spite of any unintended harm it did.
On the Talk page Talk:Kingdom of Albania in personal union with Italy#Title_2 (on an article covering a part of World War II) I found the user discussing the reason they made this change and justifying their doing so.
Specifically, the issue is the following:
Italian relations with Albania during 1914-1945 can be divided into three phases.
First, an Italian military expedition during WW1 including an Italian proclamation of Albanian "independence under Italian aegis and protection",
Second, an unequal partnership during the Interwar Period, in which Italy gained both formal and informal influence over Albanian institutions,
and Third, the Italian invasion and annexation of Albania during WW2.
All of these events are sometimes referred to as "protectorates" or "de-facto protectorates" of Italy over Albania, though there is no unanimous consensus on the validity of the term for all three events.
This was the topic of discussion on the Talk Page Topic that I found - though initial discussion was about validity of the term for WW2, the user was of the opinion that "protectorate" was not valid for the WW1 period, but that it was valid for the interwar period. This is why they decided unilaterally to redirect Italian protectorate over Albania to Treaties of Tirana (interwar period), when it was previously understood to refer to the WW1 period, creating the confusion I described and seemingly went unnoticed until now.
Here's where I decided to finally step in.
I brought up to the user on the mentioned Talk Page that their change had unintentionally been harmful.
After they reaffirmed that they felt the change was justified in spite of the harm it did, instead of pushing further, I decided to evaluate my options. I wanted to fix a mistake, which I had done before, just not on this scale. I wanted the 500 pages to link to a sensible page again (Italian expeditionary corps in Albania (World War I) clearly being the most appropriate), but was anxious about overruling the user.
I looked into my options.
My idea of the situation was the following: before the harmful change, pages that linked to Italian protectorate over Albania would obviously want to refer to the WW1 period, and now didn't. I figured there must be some pages edited after the change too, wanting to refer to the interwar period after all. I also knew for a fact that there were be pages who wanted to refer not only to the WW1 period, but also speficially to the concept of a "protectorate" during WW1, sometimes described as "Albanian Republic under Italy". Thus, I could not possibly simply revert the harmful edit, because the underlying question of validity of the term would not be solved. I decided that I needed to not just fix a mistake but also lay the groundwork for future changes and clarifications. I needed a page that could, for the moment, act as a redirect page to Italian expeditionary corps in Albania (World War I), but in the future become either: a disambiguation page for Italian action in Albania during WW1, or: be turned into a redirect page to a specific section of an article.
Having decided this, I discovered the existence of Italian Protectorate on southern Albania, an old, nearly unused redirect page to Italian expeditionary corps in Albania (World War I), which I decided would be my workaround page.
Using the "What links here" feature, I went through all (ca. 500) pages that linked to Italian protectorate over Albania, and for every page that clearly intended to refer to the WW1 period instead of the interwar period, I replaced the link with Italian Protectorate on southern Albania. This turned out to be every single one and took over an hour. I'm a bit embarassed to say that I did this instead of simply pushing back on the user, or consider if there was perhaps a better alternative before committing to edit so many links.
In the end though, things obviously went to plan and I clearly improved things.
The reason I'm posting this here in such great detail is twofold: I want to know on whether I broke any rules or etiquette during all this, and I want advice for the future on how to coordinate (or confirm approval for) things of this nature (edits across multiple pages), or rather where to document the decisions I made for others to easily view, understand, and judge. For example, I first brought up my ideas on that random Talk Page Topic instead of making my own Topic, choosing another Page, or another option I simply don't know about.

A better place to ask on Commons, would be c:Commons:Village pump/Technical.
But first, please fix your sig, which is currently unreadable pale green on white. Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 20:21, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Possible notability issue[edit]
Hello,
I've stumbled upon the article Asma Hilali and believe it doesn't reach WP:GNG. However, the author seems to be an old user who creates many articles in that same vein to increase the visibility of religious studies scholars. Meanwhile I'm a Wikipedia newcomer - so could someone double-check if my opinion is correct (or not)?

Hi @Barbalalaika, welcome to the teahouse!
We have a little page on notability specifically for academics. There's a little section there labeled criteria. If you look over the list and see that she doesn't meet any one of the criteria, then she's not notable.
Hope this helps! PhoenixCaelestis (Talk ¬∑ Contributions) 20:21, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
