Draft feedback, newbie[edit]
Hi, I am a new Wikipedia contributor (this is only my second page creation). I‚Äôve been working on a draft here: User:SueRostvold/De Lewellen.
I‚Äôve gathered a ton of references, and I‚Äôd appreciate feedback on whether my draft looks neutral in tone, and if my citations and formatting are on the right track before I submit it.
Any and all feedback appreciated. (I can take it.)¬†;)
Thanks so much for your help!
SueRostvold (talk) 17:17, 8 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@SueRostvold Take a look at WP:Named references for how to re-use some citations that you currently have repeated multiple times (e.g. to "Punk in Austin"). I suggest you move your draft to Draft:De Lewellen and then submit it for a formal review as described at WP:Articles for creation. Mike Turnbull (talk) 17:32, 8 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Okay. I will do that before I submit. Thanks. SueRostvold (talk) 18:02, 8 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Regarding the multiple references Mike, yes I knew it looked bad. But while working on the page it was helping me keep everything straight. But my plan was to fix before submitting. Thanks again for your input. SueRostvold (talk) 21:23, 8 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@SueRostvold Welcome to the Teahouse. I made a small tweak to your draft. If you like, you can move it to the Draft namespace yourself, or I can do it for you. After that, you can submit for AFC review.ThilioR O B O Tü§ñ talk 17:46, 8 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hello, SueRostvold. Your draft had those irritating ** double asterisks scattered through it. They have since been removed and replaced by inappropriate use of italics. Those are indicative of content cranked out by Artificial Intelligence robots that are prone to hallucinations and falsification. We want content on Wikipedia that is written and verified by living, breathing human beings. Please read Wikipedia:Artificial intelligence for guidance. Cullen328 (talk) 17:47, 8 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hi Cullen328. Understood. Noted. I have found chatgpt useful in hunting sources for me. (That is allowed right?) I have done my best to verify all links before using. I will read the article you suggested for guidance. Thanks for pointing me in that direction. So much to learn. SueRostvold (talk) 18:05, 8 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hi @SueRostvold, this is a bit late but just in case no one's mentioned it - getting ChatGPT (or any other AI/LLM) to find sources for you is a very bad idea. AI is extremely prone to hallucinations, which means it just makes things up. It knows you want sources, and it's going to provide sources to make you happy even if they don't actually exist! Doing your own search via Google, newspaper archives, etc is usually the best way to go. If you feel you must use ChatGPT, make absolutely sure that the links it gives you actually exist and say what it tells you they say. Do not trust the robot - it wants to answer your question in a way you will like, which isn't necessarily giving you accurate information. Welcome to Wikipedia and happy editing! Meadowlark (talk) 09:57, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Thanks! I agree 100%. Chatgpt isn't not always right, often wrong. I use it sparingly. I have found it's best to search newspaper archives myself (also fun). But yes, I always check the sources. Thank you for the reminder though.¬†:) SueRostvold (talk) 12:24, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I am not quite ready for AFC review. But thanks. Let me get back to you on this. I need to learn how to do some stuff myself. Thank you for your time. Appreciate it. SueRostvold (talk) 18:03, 8 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hi Thilio, thank you for the tweak. I appreciate you time. It I accidentally undo what you do, I apologize. I was going to work on cleaning up my links. I often work outside of wikipedia and then transfer to my draft. So if you changed, added or removed something and I don't know what, I might undo it accidentally. Hope I'm making sense. Thoughts on this? I went to history to try to see what you did but couldn't figure it out. - I know just enough to be dangerous on Wikipedia I guess. My goal is to not piss anyone off and follow the rules. Try not to get blocked again because I forgot a colon in my draft categories. Wish me luck.¬†:) SueRostvold (talk) 18:15, 8 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
IP Peer Review.[edit]
Peer Review Guidelines is not clear on whether IP editors can nominate for PR. Though I won't remember to do it by the time I get home. I know intellectually that its unlikely due to IP editors not being able to create pages however.

I see nothing to prevent an IP address from requesting a peer review. The only thing that would stop you is a semi-protected talk page. Otherwise, just follow the instructions. ~Anachronist (talk) 14:48, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Help Me See Edit Revert As Good Faith[edit]
A one-sentence edit I made last week was reverted. This is the first time a revert has happened to me. Reading WP:RV and WP:ROWN, it did not seem to me that a revert was warranted.
I started a discussion on the talk page: Talk:TESCREAL#Considering RfC regarding sentence about the origin Three other editors (not the one who did the revert) have replied, very briefly, to my lengthy explanation of my edit. I am having trouble seeing the revert as having been done in good faith, and these replies have not helped. Can someone please help me see it that way? Perhaps if someone who understands their POV restates it a bit less tersely, I will get it. Aurodea108 (talk) 19:09, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hello, @Aurodea108. As I can't see why you think the edit was in bad faith, I'm not sure that I can help you to not see it that way, but I'll stick my twopennyworth in.
A Wikipedia article should be a summary of what the sources say about the subject, not what you (or I, or other editors) know, think, or believe about the subject.
If a source does not directly say anything about the subject (specifically) then it is hard to see why that source should be cited, or what can relevantly go into the article on the basis of that source. If the source does not specifically say that it is about the origin of TESCREAL, then it cannot be used to support a statement about the origin of TESCREAL.
I also suggest that if several editors disagree with you then it's time to drop the stick. ColinFine (talk) 19:59, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Thank you @ColinFine for taking the time to reply to me extensively.
I take it you have already read completely the posts I made in that discussion thread, for which I also thank you.
The source grouped the TESCREAL paper among several earlier papers, which it described as seeing AI in a certain way.
If I understand you correctly, in order for the source to be relevant, it would have had to say explicitly something like, "First Kalluri wrote that AI may 'build systems that sanctify the status quo and advance the interests of the powerful', then Birhane and Guest wrote...then...and most recently, Gebru and Torres came up with the acronym TESCREAL to describe the ideologies they see as underpinning AI. These are
some of the authors that see ‚ÄòAI‚Äô as a way to advance capitalist, kyriarchal, authoritarian and/or white supremacist goals." The source said this succinctly, expecting the reader to be able to follow the references and unpack their clause into something like what I just wrote, rather than explicitly. Hence the source did not explicitly use the word "TESCREAL" and is being seen by you and others as not relevant.
If indeed I am understanding you correctly, then I would respond that the hypothetical passage I just wrote is more like what a good professor might write for their lower-division undergraduate students, and is not to be expected in a research-level academic paper.
The unpacking that I just did is almost a mechanical exercise, and should not change the answer to whether the source is relevant or not.
Part of the reason I am wondering about bad faith is what I am seeing as nitpicking about a stylistic choice on the part of the source.
Part of my reason for wondering about bad faith is admittedly due to the history of that page, some of which can be seen at the Talk page (some has been archived). It seems to me that my sentence, which is about a "meta" question (where did the idea of TESCREAL come from?) may have been reverted because other, less "meta", questions (does TESCREAL describe a real phenomenon? should TESCREAL be described on WP?) are contentious.
As for whether to "drop the stick", I will keep your suggestion in mind and give it some time. Aurodea108 (talk) 22:11, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
No, @Aurodea108, I haven't closely read the posts. I (and I think the other editors) are arguing on the basis of Wikipedia policy. If it is not discussed in one of the sources, it should not be discussed in the article. Period. ColinFine (talk) 22:22, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I've read through the discussion, and broadly agree with the other editors. I see zero evidence of bad faith in the replies, and I would echo ColinFine's note and argue that it would be a good idea for you to drop the stick. You introduced a source, several others have disagreed about its relevance, and part of functioning in Wikipedia is for one to recognize that consensus will frequently be against their own opinion. CoffeeCrumbs (talk) 02:42, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Disagreeing with an edit is not a reason to revert it. The OP's edit wasn't in bad faith so it shouldn't have been reverted. Period. If @Avatar317 disagreed with the edit, they could have revised it or just deleted it or started a discussion on the talk page. Reverting isn't just rude - it's confrontational because we know the editor will receive a notification saying their change has been reverted. @Aurodea108 My advice - take on board the feedback that you've since received on the sentence and sources. If you still want to add your amendment, add a revised sentence assuming that instead of reverting, you'd had the discussion first. (ps. I think the 7 sources after "several earlier ones" is a bit much.) MmeMaigret (talk) 03:08, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
It sounds like you don't understand how Wikipedia functions.
If I remove recently added content (whether I do that operation by simply removing it OR by reverting an edit or series of edits) it APPEARS with the automated summary tag in italics "Reverted."
Sure, the other editor doesn't get a notice unless I do the "revert" function, but that editor's addition/contribution is removed, so exactly the same result.
And per WP:BRD that is the way we edit; and when an editor gets Reverted, they get pinged on what others felt was wrong with their edit so they can modify it and re-add; otherwise they might not notice that someone removed their addition, so it can be seen as confrontational (your view) or as a more efficient way of collaboration. (Additionally, a removal can be seen as a bad-faith "stealth revert", so that to me seems worse, I'd rather someone see and understand my issue with their edit(s).)
As noted in my edit summary, I felt that that source does not adequately support the added statement.
I can understand how someone could read that source and say to themselves "oh, I see, this author is lumping together multiple papers about AI and one of them is the Gebru/TESCEAL paper."
But our policy on WP:SYNTH says: "Do not ... state or imply a conclusion not explicitly stated by any of the sources."
And here the author (van Rooij) never mentions TESCREAL even once in the entire paper. ---Avatar317(talk) 05:30, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Press edit, delete the sentence, press save, leave a summary. Not a reversion. What part of that was hard for you to understand? You might also have a re-read of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reverting#When%20to%20revert MmeMaigret (talk) 17:17, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
You linked to an ESSAY, not policy.
What part of "a removal can be seen as a bad-faith "stealth revert", so that to me seems worse, I'd rather someone see and understand my issue with their edit(s)" is hard for you to understand?
Providing no feedback to someone and fixing their mistakes without their knowledge doesn't help them become a better editor. ---Avatar317(talk) 22:37, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Best practice for size of edits[edit]
When an article needs heavy editing, is it better to do several small edits or one big edit? Also if you plan on editing very different parts of a page, such as tables, lists, and text, is it better to focus on only one per edit? I was wondering if small edits make reverting easier, because the good edits don‚Äôt have to be reverted along with the bad one. BrightPinkBirb (talk) 23:37, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
If you are uncertain as to whether your edit needs to be reverted, perhaps you should use the preview function. For an article that is very active, then smaller edits are better to avoid an edit conflict. Also for a controversial article, small edits are better in case of explanation required or disagreement. Also consider if your browser saves your editing. If you do a long big edit and the power goes off, or Wikipedia goes into maintenance mode or something crashes, you don't want to lose your work. Perhaps adding one section or paragraph at a time for inactive articles is a good compromise against losing your work. Graeme Bartlett (talk) 00:02, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Alternatively, if your making huge edits, you may wish to do it in your sandbox, or to put it off-wiki altogether (such as Google Docs or notepad) before implementing it to the article. Google Docs should automatically save your work, provided you have an internet connection. This doesn't really work for articles that currently receive more than several edits per day, such as the Charlie Kirk situation. If there's any disagreement with your changes to the article, the talk page is the way to go, as per the dispute resolution. JuniperChill (talk) 17:04, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
This is nothing but my opinion: I think it's not the character count but how the material fits together, and if you're in a position to be wondering about this, I think the answer is probably "so that it all belongs together, and anyone reverting it would want to revert all of it together".
I don't think this answer applies to things like going through a badly spelled article and just fixing uncontroversial spelling mistakes. Nobody should want to revert that anyway. TooManyFingers (talk) 20:58, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
What do I do in this situation?[edit]
the noisiest and ugliest background humanly possible?
I noticed that this Revision by
Smuckola had a rude edit summary, and I want to template them (couldn't find their pronouns sorry smuckola) with Template:Uw-bes1, but I'm worried that since I rarely edit, (not even autoconfirmed yet, but I will be someday) I might not have the authority/knowledge to do so. (even though I've read WP:CIVIL and am fairly certain that their edit summary was uncivil in ways covered in two different parts (specifically in the part on edit summaries, and the general section on identifying incivility)) What do I do? Zonedbaser (talk) 02:15, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
In general, the first thing you do is discuss it with the other editor. But I think calling this incivility is a massive stretch, in my opinion. CoffeeCrumbs (talk) 02:30, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Thanks for the advice, but if you don't mind me asking, how do you see it as a stretch, because when I look at it, I see insults towards the photo as the main meat of the summary. ("wrongheaded photo that should've never been shot", "noisiest and ugliest background humanly possible") Am I taking policy too literally? (though, the second example of covering in policy was a bit of a stretch i admit) Zonedbaser (talk) 02:42, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
No, you're not wrong. I've seen some snarky edit summaries but "utterly wrongheaded" "should have never been shot", "noisiest and ugliest background humanly possible" is beyond the pale. I don't think you're going to get far reporting it though. Suggest you let it go and accept it's more about them than you. @Smuckola should have told ChatGPT this is what I really want to say, suggest a polite but firm alternative. MmeMaigret (talk) 04:10, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
ChatGPT usage is heavily discouraged on Wikipedia. Sarsenet‚Ä¢he/they‚Ä¢(talk) 04:25, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Whether it's ChatGPT, a thesaurus, or asking a friend for advice, the point was about toning down a comment. But sure, let's debate AI policy. MmeMaigret (talk) 05:04, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
IMO "The whole point was to illustrate color, so they shot it in the noisiest and ugliest background humanly possible, making blue look green." is hyperbolic, and too close to calling the photographer (who hasn't edited since 2022) an idiot, and a little disappointing coming from an editor who's been here 16 years. It's a pic of a glass of soda on an ordinary table, and it certainly looks blue to me. Fwiw, it's used on several WP:s. However, if this was at WP:ANI (where problems of behavior are discussed), it wouldn't go anywhere unless it was part of a long history of uncivility. Gr√•bergs Gr√•a S√•ng (talk) 05:31, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The civility rule is to comment on content, not contributors. That edit summary was a comment on content. I don't see the rude language crossing the line into incivility. It's just uncivilized, not incivil. ~Anachronist (talk) 06:22, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Per "utterly wrongheaded photo" etc it's a little borderline on contributors, I think. Gr√•bergs Gr√•a S√•ng (talk) 06:40, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Question about using the # sign[edit]
Hi everyone,
I‚Äôm a new editor and cannot find a clear answer to this:
Can the # sign be used in an actor‚Äôs filmography?
The actor's official credit in the film is ‚ÄòSoldier #1‚Äô, but I have been told that it goes against Wikipedia:Manual of Style and that the credit should be listed as ‚ÄòSoldier No. 1‚Äô. Shouldn't credits be listed accurately on an actor‚Äôs filmography, or is there no exception to this rule?
Many thanks! NicR77 (talk) 02:38, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
What is the actor's name? MahmoudAbbasAlDilfti (talk) 03:29, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Craig Parker NicR77 (talk) 03:38, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
the Wikipedia article on "A Soldier's Sweetheart", which is the movie where Parker acted as Soldier #/no. 1, lists in the "Cast" section as "Soldier no. 2 (Tony Billy)", so maybe it's better to keep the "no." format for consistency.
I still do not know what part of the Manual of Style that sets the standard for this.
- MahmoudAbbasAlDilfti (talk) 04:10, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Thank you for your response. If you look at the revision history on A Soldier's Sweetheart, that was just recently changed by the user that I have been having a disagreement with. Since Craig Parker‚Äôs Wikipedia article was created his credit has been listed as ‚ÄúSoldier #1‚Äù (until only recently). His credit is listed as Solider #1 on both IMDb https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0129414/
and on TV Guide https://www.tvguide.com/movies/a-soldiers-sweetheart/cast/2030012091/. Thanks again for your time! NicR77 (talk) 04:31, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
If you find out how he is actually credited in the film itself, not on a website like IMDB, then that would be the appropriate way to describe the role in our article. ~Anachronist (talk) 06:24, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The "#" policy is MOS:NUMBERSIGN, Avoid using the # symbol when referring to numbers.
In your case, I think the more specific policies are MOS:FILMCAST and MOS:TVCAST, which say Names should be referred to as credited, or by common name supported by a reliable source. [...] For uncredited roles, a citation should be provided in accordance with Wikipedia's verifiability policy. Do not use IMDb as a reference, as it is considered unreliable.
Since MOS:FILMCAST and MOS:TVCAST have a more specific focus, they would take precedence. Blepbob (talk) 06:55, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Thank you! Previously, I had provided a WP:RS via TV Guide to support this but another user kept reverting my edit saying it went against WP:MOS. How should I respond if this happens again? NicR77 (talk) 08:32, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The recommended strategy is "BOLD, revert, discuss":
Bold - Start off by making the edits you want.
Revert - You can revert other people's edits, so long as you aren't edit warring. Other people can also revert yours. Provide explanations in your edit summaries.
Discuss - If there's a lot of reverting, all disagreeing editors should stop reverting and take it to that article's WP:talk page. Let uninvolved editors weigh in. Try to reach an agreement.
If you revert twice, then you are no longer following the BRD cycle: If your reversion is reverted, then there may be a good reason for it. Go to the talk page to learn why you were reverted. Blepbob (talk) 14:47, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
If that doesn't help, WP:DISCFAIL is one of the few essays providing good advice. ~ ToBeFree (talk) 15:51, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

assistance with writing a wikipedia page[edit]

Welcome to the Teahouse, it's not clear what you are suggesting or asking here? Could you be more specific. Theroadislong (talk) 10:24, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

@Barry Hart: Your link is broken but I guess you mean User:HRShami with a colon. I don't know HRShami or LustrePR but they have no affiliation with the Wikimedia Foundation which runs Wikipedia. Users who try to create articles are often contacted by scammers who make false promises and false claims about who they are. See Wikipedia:Scam warning.

Hello, @Barry Hart. On their user page, @HRShami says they "work with", LustrePR, they have certainly successfully created a number of articles (they claim 900, but I haven't checked), and for the one such article I have looked at they have complied with the Terms of Use by declaring (on the article's talk page) who they were paid by to create it.
So, while they are in no way official or endorsed by the Wikimedia Foundation, it appears that they comply with the terms of use, and have a track record of successfully creating articles. ColinFine (talk) 14:59, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The tool says HRShami created 902 pages, nearly all of them biographies, presumably from paid clients. The deleted user contributions also show many page moves from mainspace to draftspace, for articles they created (possibly accidentally) in mainspace, with a comment about paid editing. Clearly a paid editor although there is no disclosure on the user page. ~Anachronist (talk) 21:37, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
You say HRShami is "a user group". Does that mean the username is being used by more than one person? ~Anachronist (talk) 21:27, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Barry Hart. I am legitimate in so far as complying with all the Wikipedia policies on paid editing. However, I am not affiliated with Wikimedia or Wikipedia; no paid editor is. HRShami (talk) 03:48, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

I've replaced your URL with a standard wikilink. You have submitted the draft for review, which is the best way to get feedback. My only comment is that you have included in the WP:LEAD some information and sources not mentioned in the main body of the article. The lead is supposed to summarise the body, not mention information only there. Mike Turnbull (talk) 17:34, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Ion[edit]
I want to modify slightly pages ION, CONDUCTIVITY, IONS ASSOCIATION etc

Hi @AndreiDukhin. Please don't share your personal email address: this is a public forum. You are free to edit those articles. You have nearly 1,000 edits already, so I am unsure what specific help you need? qcne (talk) 19:07, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hello, @AndreiDukhin. As qcne says, you are welcome to edit the articles, but please take note of the following first:
You should read Verifiability and original research. If you are adding information from reliable sources, please cite those sources - see WP:REFB. (Added: you should only add information from reliable sources)
If any of the work or the sources that you want to cite is your own work, then that is regarded as a conflict of interest, and you should not edit the articles directly, but should instead raise edit requests on the articles' talk pages, so somebody uninvolved can consider your request.
I have no idea whether or not the material you want to add might be controversial; but it does often happen that editors disagree about what should be in an article. I suggest you also get familiar with WP:BRD, which explains how we (try to) reach consensus.

page numbers in footnotes[edit]
In Samuel Butler (novelist), n.5 appears seven times, as "a" through "g". The quotation in the text attached to "a" is on page 16 of the cited book. The quotation in the text attached to "g" is on pages 6-7 of the cited book. (I will look for "b" through "f" when I have a chance.) How do I enter separate page numbers in the different appearances of n.5? Maurice Magnus (talk) 19:07, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hello, @Maurice Magnus, and welcome to the Teahouse.
Help:References and page numbers gives various ways to handle this. ColinFine (talk) 20:11, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Thanks. I remembered that I once did this for another article. I looked at that article, thinking that I'd use the technique I'd used in it. It worked for "g". I inserted {{ rp | 6-7 }}.(Ignore the spaces; I added them so that it would not come out as [1]:‚Ää6‚Äì7‚Ää) But I couldn't use that technique for "a," because "a", being the first appearance of n.5, has a different format, spelling out the whole footnote.

References
^
Cite error: The named reference Stillman2 was invoked but never defined (see the help page).
Maurice Magnus, it seems a little strange to worry about page numbers for something described as vaguely as "Clara G. Stillman, Samuel Butler: A Mid-Victorian Modern". Edition (if not the first), "location" (place), publisher, year, ISBN? Add such detail to whichever one of a‚Äìg contains any detail beyond "name". Then add Template:Rp in exactly the same way (aside from altering the page number(s), of course) to each of a‚Äìg. So you'll have something like <ref name="stillman">[bibliographic detail]</ref>{{Rp|26}} for one and <ref name="stillman" />{{Rp|93‚Äì95}} for each of the others. -- Hoary (talk) 23:07, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The details about Stillman's book are listed under "Further reading." Maurice Magnus (talk) 01:21, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Maurice Magnus It is best to put the full details into the reference section using named references, as discussed above, then remove that book from "Further reading" as it is now part of the main body of the article and doesn't need to be duplicated there.

Standardize image size in infobox[edit]
Hi, I'm a new editor and I had a question on how I could standard the size of the blade images for the draft I'm working on. I have two blade SVG's I made that are in the infobox, and the men's blade SVG is noticeably smaller than the woman's blade even though I used the same Wikipedia commons SVG as a base for both.
Is there a way to standardize the size for the two images or at least make one match the other? Here is the draft that I'm talking about. Thanks, Pixzzl. Pixzzl (talk) 21:44, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Would it work to merge the two SVGs into one, so that they're both there but as top and bottom of one picture? TooManyFingers (talk) 21:53, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I could try to do that, but creating them with Inkscape was hard enough on it's own and I honestly don't know how to merge them. Is there no way to just set the size for them? Pixzzl (talk) 21:59, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Pixzzl According to the documentation at {{Infobox rowing club}}, the image parameter is supposed to be used for a picture of the clubhouse/boathouse, not as a way to force in a second blade image. I suspect that's why your two images are coming out at different default sizes. Maybe the solution would be to place one blade image only in the infobox and put the second one as a thumb image within the main text. If you want to add both as a single blade image, as suggested above, then that should be easy using Inkscape and I'll help if you ask via my talk page. Mike Turnbull (talk) 10:34, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Ah, okay. I can do this. Later today if I send a message on your talk page would you be able to help me? Thanks, Pixzzl. Pixzzl (talk) 12:06, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Pixzzl I've done the merged file, which would probably be best if uploaded to Commons by you, as it is based on your originals. You don't seem to have set an email address for your account. If you do that, I'll email the .svg to you. I won't see what your address is unless you reply to my own message. Mike Turnbull (talk) 13:30, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

why allow paid editing?[edit]
hello! I have a question. why is it that wikipedia permits paid editing to occur at all? right now, paid editors have to declare their COI, which is nice, but to me at least it would make more sense to ban paid editing entirely. given all of the scams, and wasted time, and useless questions, and disruptive editors, I think it would be better to make paid editing and COI editing against wikipedia policy. after all, wikimedia doesn't get compensated for paid editing work or anything. of course, I'm not demanding this decades-old policy be changed immediately. I'm just genuinely curious. that's all. thanks! 67.218.119.178 (talk) 22:12, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The consensus of the Wikipedia community has been that if we were to ban paid editing, the paid editors would probably still edit here but would not admit it and thus be more difficult to regulate. MrOllie (talk) 22:20, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
We highly discourage paid editors from editing articles directly. Some of them have useful suggestions, and as for the rest: I expect that people are more likely to comply with disclosure and editing requirements than to respect a strict ban. And given that our scam warning hasn't kept scammers from promising they can publish and protect articles (or alternatively threaten to delete them, as blackmail), I doubt announcing a strict ban would affect them much either. jlwoodwa (talk) 22:24, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I hadn't known that we have paid editors. If they are discouraged from editing articles directly, then what do they edit? I'm just curious; I have no interest in being one. Maurice Magnus (talk) 22:57, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
For existing articles, they can edit talk pages and make edit requests; for new articles, they can create them in draftspace and submit them to Articles for creation. jlwoodwa (talk) 23:00, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
WP:COIADVICE. And of course, they can do un-paid editing. Gr√•bergs Gr√•a S√•ng (talk) 06:16, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Maurice Magnus, "assistance with writing a wikipedia page" (above) may interest you. -- Hoary (talk) 07:52, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Not all paid editors are ill-intentioned scammers! For example, it's quite likely that when there's a staff reshuffle at a university, and there's a new vice-chancellor, it will be some random member of faculty, grad student or post-doc who first notices that Wikipedia hasn't caught up. They aren't necessarily employed by the university's comms department, but because they're employed by the university, they're paid editors. They are, however, quite useful. Elemimele (talk) 12:55, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Some paid editors are very helpful in keeping articles up-to-date. Some I interact with provide relevant photographs and suggest new sources that can be used: all via article talk pages, as required by the COI provisions. Mike Turnbull (talk) 13:19, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Hello, @BonkoSupreme, and welcome to the Teahouse.
I don't wish to appear hostile, but we keep seeing this: people who take money to do a job they do not (yet) have the skills to do, and expect us unpaid volunteers to help them earn their money.
My earnest advice to new editors is to not even think about
trying to create an article until you have spent several weeks - at least - learning about how Wikipedia works by making improvements to existing articles. Once you have understood core policies such as verifiability, neutral point of view, reliable, independent sources, and notability, and experienced how we handle disagreements with other editors (the Bold, Revert, Discuss cycle), then you might be ready to read your first article carefully, and try creating a draft. If you don't follow this advice but try to create an article without this preparation, you are likely to have a frustrating and disappointing experience with Wikipedia.
I would say that this is more important for paid editors than for others. ColinFine (talk) 09:40, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

A redirect is a page, and new accounts cannot create pages in mainspace (this depends on number of edits as well as time).

Draft:All the President's Elephants (Film)[edit]
Revisions by Louiskk23 to Draft:All the President's Elephants (Film)
Hi everyone, I am not a regular Wikipedia creator/editor. I drafted this page after being so impressed by this documentary. I'm now concerned about the amount of editing (-10,000, then + 2,000) just done to my draft All the President's Elephants (Film) submission. This below is what I've now written on the Talk Page of this article, and am repeating it here (Not sure which is the right thing to do.) ------ Are there experienced people who can review this please?
14 Sept revisions by Louiskk23 to Draft:All the President's Elephants (Film)
[edit source]
Thank you for your input Louiskk23. Having read 3 of her elephant memoirs and also watched this documentary several times, I feel like changing the wording here to say that Sharon Pincott simply had a "close" relationship with the elephants doesn't capture just how close a relationship she actually had with them. In the documentary she actually kisses (more than once) a huge wild adult elephant ‚Äì not hand-raised, not one in fenced areas. Family groups also come to her when she calls to them. I feel that this is much more than simply having a ‚Äúclose‚Äù relationship with these elephants. As this article indicated previously, it has been said by numerous world-wide reviewers that she had one of the most remarkable relationships with elephants anywhere in the world. Hence, I do think it‚Äôs fair to say her relationship with the elephants was at least ‚Äúextremely close‚Äù. Re the taking out the comparisons to Dian Fossey and Jane Goodall etc I wonder how necessary this is, since it does help to show why the documentary has been so successful, and what an interesting subject she is ‚Äì although I‚Äôve made no changes to these edits. Does anyone have any comments/suggestions re these last edits? WikiAdd01 (talk) 00:39, 16 September 2025 (UTC) WikiAdd01 (talk) 09:40, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Something extra - I feel that there is other relevant/interesting information that has also now been removed, shortening the article, and the references, substantially. WikiAdd01 (talk) 09:48, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hello, I hope you are well. Before stating my point, I would like to say that I have nothing against your article or you personally. On the contrary, I found the subject of the documentary very interesting. Although I agree that my editing was drastic, I modified text that I felt was excessive and contained unnecessary praise. as well as being redundant. What I did was try to make the article more neutral so that the format would better comply with Wikipedia guidelines and thus support its approval. If you look, two experienced editors edited your article after this, one of them removed a large part of the article that, in my opinion, was unnecessary and not very neutral. Furthermore, another editor commented that there is no mention of the documentary in two references you added. Similarly, I promise not to edit that draft anymore, but instead to let the more experienced editors do what they think is best.
I would also like to say that I have been suffering what I consider to be ‚Äúharassment‚Äù from the editor Celjski Grad. At first, I made a mistake and the problem was solved on the librarians' board by clarifying the confusion, but since then I can't make any edits without Celjski Grad harassing me. Even when I corrected simple spelling mistakes, he harassed me and wrote to me. When I make edits in my sandbox, he harasses me. When I improve syntax, he writes to me too. Although I agree that the edit to the documentary was drastic, the other edits were simpler. In fact, I had to write the text and modify it in a Word file instead of in my sandbox because I was afraid that the user Celjski Grad would also complain about me editing in my sandbox, so I thought, ‚ÄúIf I do it in a separate notepad and then paste my edit without using my sandbox, the user will probably be calmer.‚Äù But even that didn't save me from harassment by this user. I had already made my last edits in a Word file, which is why it seemed like I did them ‚Äúquickly.‚Äù Louiskk23 (talk) 18:04, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

@Valentinfenk There are many messages on your talk page explaining the situation. As you say, you are a paid editor and under Wikimedia terms and conditions you must disclose that on your user page and subsequently only edit the article via its talk page so that neutral editors without a conflict of interest can assess them. All edit suggestions must include reliable sources so that readers can verify what is stated. Mike Turnbull (talk) 13:04, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hello, @Valentinfenk. To add to what Mike said: please note that Wikipedia has little interest in what the subject of an article says or wants to say about themselves, or what their associates say about them. Wikipedia is almost exclusively interested in what people who have no connection with the subject, and who have not been prompted or fed information on behalf of the subject, have chosen to publish about the subject in reliable sources. If enough material is cited from independent sources to establish notability, a limited amount of uncontroversial factual information may be added from non-independent sources.
Also, please read about edit warring, because that is what you have been doing. ColinFine (talk) 13:25, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Hello, Praj9289. Often, a draft will have multiple problems and various reviewers will emphasize different reasons in their decline notices. This is normal and should not be a concern. You should substantively address the comments of each of the reviewers by improving the draft accordingly. The phrase "unsung heroes" that you use raises concerns, as "unsung" can be interpreted as a synonym for "not notable and therefore not eligible for a Wikipedia article". Your references do not make it easy to verify the content. For example, the URL in your reference to the multi-volume Dictionary of Martyrs: India's Freedom Struggle leads to the cover page for volume 4 rather to the pages actually about the subject of your draft. You need to structure your draft in such a way that a reviewer can verify that this person has been the subject of significant coverage in reliable sources that are entirely independent of him. His son discussing him in the preface of a book is clearly not an independent source. Another problem are the assertions that he is notable because of his leadership role in various organizations such as the Panchayati Raksha Gram Seva Dal. And yet there is no Wikipedia article about the Panchayati Raksha Gram Seva Dal, and no reference to a reliable source assessing this group. How is the reviewer or any reader able to assess the significance of this group on their own? Was it an influential mass organization active for years, or a small, temporary committee? Or something else. So, I believe that your draft still needs a lot of work. Cullen328 (talk) 16:47, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
There is a whole government website over gran raksha dal https://dalpatigramrakshadalmahasangh.com/member-new.php
Secondly, the page no for Dictionary of Martyr is mentioned in the reference i cannot create a link to the exact page number althought i have mentioned it in the reference.
His son was the hugher education minister, He held office of public importance hence making his statements more than just a son's statement .
But unsung heroes is said because they are unsung because of their untimely death. Not because the did not get enough coverage or notability Praj9289 (talk) 16:58, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
also if would be kind of you if you can guide me over the fact that if i am mentioning names of certain people who are of national importance like the first oresident of our country how do i get a link on his name.. or if i am mentioning quit india movement how do i get a link so that people could click on it and directly visit the wikipedia page for that event for ex quit india movement Praj9289 (talk) 17:02, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
In the source editor, you link to an article (or other Wikipedia page) by putting the exact title in double square brackets; so [[Quit India Movement]] displays as Quit India Movement. I don't know how you do it in the visual editor. See Help:Wikilinks. ColinFine (talk) 22:30, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Just a note, this is not really a government website. It looks to be a private website for a political party Assassin (talk) 18:44, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Cannot Edit Protected Page[edit]
Hello,
I am trying to edit this page but I cannot for some reason even though I am an extended confirmed editor, so why can I not edit this page? Thank you! Agnieszka653 (talk) 16:01, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Agnieszka653, can you tell us a bit more about what you're experiencing? Firefangledfeathers (talk / contribs) 16:16, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Similar to a problem I asked about the other day, I find on some articles I clicking edit but I am simply not able to make any additions or deletions. However I can edit other pages just fine. Could this have anything to do with pending changes? Agnieszka653 (talk) 17:02, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Firefangledfeathers: Please describe more precisely what you do and what happens. It looks normal when I edit Houthis with VisualEditor. I click before "The Houthis" in the lead, see a vertical blinking bar where I clicked, press "Delete" to remove "T" and type "T" to add it again. What happens for you?

coordinating edits across multiple articles[edit]
I only recently go into editing and am still somewhat inexperienced with online encyclopedia, but more importantly online fora in general. I had been reading and editing on a small scale for a while, but perhaps got out of my depth when I fixed an issue on a historical topic. I'm sure that any student of history knows that seemingly small and innocous discussions about words can turn out to be longstanding political disputes when looked at more closely.
Please bear with me for the wall of text that follows.
I noticed recently that lots of pages related to Albanian history had the same bizarre mistake. I soon found out why: the page Italian protectorate over Albania was supposed to cover a part of World War I, but after a user changed this earlier this year, it was now a redirect page to Treaties of Tirana, a not unrelated but different topic covering a part of the interwar period.
I found out using the "What Links here" feature that ca. 500 pages used the former page to provide further information on WW1, instead providing information on the interwar period for no apparent reason.
(It is at this point that I have to ask whether it breaks etiquette to talk about a user without formally Mentioning them. I don't want to annoy them, as this is about me asking advice and not wanting to criticise them. Their username is Barjimoa.)
After I noticed this, I was unsure what to do.
Rolling back the change would have fixed the confusion, but I wanted to see whether there was perhaps a reason for this change, in spite of any unintended harm it did.
On the Talk page Talk:Kingdom of Albania in personal union with Italy#Title_2 (on an article covering a part of World War II) I found the user discussing the reason they made this change and justifying their doing so.
Specifically, the issue is the following:
Italian relations with Albania during 1914-1945 can be divided into three phases.
First, an Italian military expedition during WW1 including an Italian proclamation of Albanian "independence under Italian aegis and protection",
Second, an unequal partnership during the Interwar Period, in which Italy gained both formal and informal influence over Albanian institutions,
and Third, the Italian invasion and annexation of Albania during WW2.
All of these events are sometimes referred to as "protectorates" or "de-facto protectorates" of Italy over Albania, though there is no unanimous consensus on the validity of the term for all three events.
This was the topic of discussion on the Talk Page Topic that I found - though initial discussion was about validity of the term for WW2, the user was of the opinion that "protectorate" was not valid for the WW1 period, but that it was valid for the interwar period. This is why they decided unilaterally to redirect Italian protectorate over Albania to Treaties of Tirana (interwar period), when it was previously understood to refer to the WW1 period, creating the confusion I described and seemingly went unnoticed until now.
Here's where I decided to finally step in.
I brought up to the user on the mentioned Talk Page that their change had unintentionally been harmful.
After they reaffirmed that they felt the change was justified in spite of the harm it did, instead of pushing further, I decided to evaluate my options. I wanted to fix a mistake, which I had done before, just not on this scale. I wanted the 500 pages to link to a sensible page again (Italian expeditionary corps in Albania (World War I) clearly being the most appropriate), but was anxious about overruling the user.
I looked into my options.
My idea of the situation was the following: before the harmful change, pages that linked to Italian protectorate over Albania would obviously want to refer to the WW1 period, and now didn't. I figured there must be some pages edited after the change too, wanting to refer to the interwar period after all. I also knew for a fact that there were be pages who wanted to refer not only to the WW1 period, but also speficially to the concept of a "protectorate" during WW1, sometimes described as "Albanian Republic under Italy". Thus, I could not possibly simply revert the harmful edit, because the underlying question of validity of the term would not be solved. I decided that I needed to not just fix a mistake but also lay the groundwork for future changes and clarifications. I needed a page that could, for the moment, act as a redirect page to Italian expeditionary corps in Albania (World War I), but in the future become either: a disambiguation page for Italian action in Albania during WW1, or: be turned into a redirect page to a specific section of an article.
Having decided this, I discovered the existence of Italian Protectorate on southern Albania, an old, nearly unused redirect page to Italian expeditionary corps in Albania (World War I), which I decided would be my workaround page.
Using the "What links here" feature, I went through all (ca. 500) pages that linked to Italian protectorate over Albania, and for every page that clearly intended to refer to the WW1 period instead of the interwar period, I replaced the link with Italian Protectorate on southern Albania. This turned out to be every single one and took over an hour. I'm a bit embarassed to say that I did this instead of simply pushing back on the user, or consider if there was perhaps a better alternative before committing to edit so many links.
In the end though, things obviously went to plan and I clearly improved things.
The reason I'm posting this here in such great detail is twofold: I want to know on whether I broke any rules or etiquette during all this, and I want advice for the future on how to coordinate (or confirm approval for) things of this nature (edits across multiple pages), or rather where to document the decisions I made for others to easily view, understand, and judge. For example, I first brought up my ideas on that random Talk Page Topic instead of making my own Topic, choosing another Page, or another option I simply don't know about. Tonuka (talk) 16:02, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Tonuka, Bajimoa, Srnec and you were already discussing this in Talk:Kingdom of Albania in personal union with Italy. Nikkimaria had been too, but seemed to have dropped out -- perhaps simply because they weren't aware that the discussion continued. I don't think that attempting to restart the discussion elsewhere in order to describe your proposed edits would have been helpful. What could have helped would have been to post a revised and abridged version of your proposal there, and invitations elsewhere -- perhaps WT:WikiProject Albania, WT:WikiProject Italy, WT:WikiProject International relations -- to join the discussion. I suggest that you revise any "wall of text" ruthlessly, keeping the revision on your hard drive, revisit one or two days later, revise again, and only then post. Wherever you might post an invitation to join a discussion, be very careful to be concise and to avoid the appearance of canvassing either for your position or against some other position. An invitation should be understandable even to editors who are distracted or half asleep, and must be worded to avoid any risk of starting a parallel discussion. (And don't rush to follow my advice: others here may point out problems with it, or have better advice.) -- Hoary (talk) 23:23, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Whether "these articles look okay" to us in which sense? Whichever Wikipedia article each of these is or might be used on, the Wikipedia article has a talk page; and it's on that talk page that you can ask about the looking-okay-ness of this or that potential source. Though you should be a lot clearer than "[looking] okay to you".

Talk page for an article[edit]
Hello, folks at the Teahouse. I recently created an article, Saji Varghese, but am unable to wrap my head around how its talk page should look/be created.

Hey there! Welcome to the Teahouse.
Looks like someone else has set the talk page up with a script that's added everything necessary, but for your knowledge, most talk pages use the {{WikiProject banner shell}} template with a few parameters and other templates. Have a look at the source markup for your talk page to see what's been added there.
Feel free to let me know if you have any questions! Great work starting an article on Wikipedia:) SnowyRiver28 (talk) 07:44, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Fixing wrong citation in youtuber infobox[edit]
This is a fairly minor issue, but at Jeremy Hambly, I have a list of subscriber and view counts for each channel. However, all are simply referenced to TheQuartering's about page by the infobox. I think that it should be fine to not have a citation, given that there are external links in the same box to satisfy verifiability concerns, so is there a way to remove this citation? Based5290 :3 (talk) 07:39, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hey there, welcome to the Teahouse! You can remove citations from an infobox by clicking on it if you're using the Visual Editor, and selecting Edit. This will bring up a menu where you can find the field you're looking to remove the reference from, and then you can go ahead and remove the reference from after the text.
Note that references usually aren't needed in infoboxes if the information is repeated and cited in the article per MOS:INFOBOXREF. SnowyRiver28 (talk) 07:49, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The infobox automatically inserts the citation (see, for example, Trisha Paytas; the source code does not have a citation in the infobox), so the visual editor can't be used to remove it. Based5290 :3 (talk) 08:12, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
In your article, if you look at the source markup for the infobox in the subscribers field, you'll see the following:
|subscribers
= *TheQuartering: 1.9M<ref name="TheQuarteringChannel">{{cite web |title=TheQuartering |url=https://www.youtube.com/@TheQuartering |website=YouTube}}</ref>*UnsleevedMedia: 143K<ref name="UnsleevedMediaChannel">{{cite web |title=UnsleevedMedia |url=https://www.youtube.com/@mtgheadquarters |website=YouTube}}</ref>*ClawStruck: 108K<ref name="ClawStruckChannel">{{cite web |title=ClawStruck |url=https://www.youtube.com/@ClawStruck |website=YouTube}}</ref>
Notice how each of the list items have a <ref> reference after them? If you remove this, it will remove the citation.
Note: These are the first instances of the citations, meaning if you delete them here (if using the source editor)other places on the page using the same citations will break. I'd recommend first moving the full citation (whatever is inside the ref tags) to wherever else in the article they're used to avoid losing them.
I hope this all makes sense, let me know if it doesn't! SnowyRiver28 (talk) 08:21, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Sorry, I think you're misunderstanding the question. Right now the infobox sub list looks something like:
TheQuartering: 1.9M[1]
UnsleevedMedia: 143K[2]
ClawStruck: 108K[3][4]
Notice how the last item has two citations? I did not insert ref [4] there, the infobox did that. I am asking how to remove ref [4]. Based5290 :3 (talk) 08:48, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Ahh I see, my apologies for misinterpreting your question.
This is a quirk imposed by the {{Infobox YouTube personality}}. Once you add the channel handle in the infobox field, it automatically generates that citation to a YouTube stats website. I've had a look at the page of that template and unfortunately I can't see any way of getting around this. You could ask on the infobox's talk page here, or wait for another editor to respond to you here at the Teahouse. SnowyRiver28 (talk) 09:02, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Based5290, if you look at the template example with the YouTuber Ludwig, it seems that you can avoid the automatically-generated citation by omitting the channel_handle and providing manually-formatted channels.
So instead of
{{Infobox YouTube personality
|channel_handle=example
|channel_name=example
|channel_handle2=example
|...
try
{{Infobox YouTube personality
|channels = {{flatlist|
* [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrPseYLGpNygVi34QpGNqpA Ludwig]
* [https://www.youtube.com/@YoutubeHandle Example]
* [https://www.youtube.com/@ThirdChannel Other Example]
}}
|...
to render the inline list
Ludwig
Example
Other Example
As @SnowyRiver28 mentioned, you can also head to the template's talk page or to WikiProject YouTube. There you could request for someone who's worked on the template to add a more official way to stop the automatic citation, such as a new parameter called |nocite=y.

How to deal with personal attacks?[edit]
I'd like some advice on how acceptable personal attacks are on Wikipedia. I was led to understand that they're not okay but when I edited what seemed to me to be an incorrect diagram on French battleship Libert√© I was reverted by Parsecboy with the comment "go to the talk page, dingdong - you're looking at it wrong". Full disclosure, I barely consider it a personal attack, it's just schoolyard bullying tier taunts but I was my irritated by the spirit of the thing when I was hoping if am indeed wrong someone would provide any counter-argument or evidence without resorting to that sort of immaturity. It's not at all productive for what is apparently a collaborative environment.
Either way, I went to the talkpage (Talk:French_battleship_Libert√©#Another_error?) and put further my argument alongside a kind request of 'hey can you not use personal attacks?'. In response Parsecboy gave several points of Parsecboy:
A actually good argument, I still disagree with it on other metrics but hey, it's something
Random accusations that the youtuber who made me check the wikipedia page because of the arguments he made was a plagiarist. Honestly, while I like listening to the youtuber, I have nothing in the race if he turns out to be or not (bar disappointment because he's otherwise good), but Parsecboy has provided no evidence of the accusation and regardless I don't see how it is at all relevant (even if someone's a plagiarist or done something wrong, they can still be right on basic logic)
An argument about my maths. Like the first point, I almost want to engage with this because I don't think it adds up but if I'm not going to be treated in good faith I've not interested
Justifying the personal attacks by accusing me of "disrupting the article for months" which confused me because this is the first time I've edited it. Looking at the history I found that there have been several IPs previously arguing the same thing, one is also from Canberra so yes, I could kind of see why Parsecboy would lump me with them (but on the other hand there are half a million people in this city and I have a dynamic IP) but the other is from Kansas City in the USA so this comes off as just "you're an IP and therefore a vandal responsible for all other IPs". Also apparently childish personal attacks are okay to use because "I should just get out more".
In summary, while I'm not convinced I'm wrong I'm honestly not interested in trying to help Wikipedia here if I'm just going to be treated to childish insults and accusations of disrupting articles which seem to be purely on the basis of being an IP. I decided I'd ask here after googling what to do when an editor seems to be breaking Wikipedia's guidelines and you are a new user, given from this experience my understanding is "Wikipedia guidelines only apply to interactions with registered users, if it's an IP address then feel free to blame them for what other IPs have done and childishly insult them", especially since Parsecboy is an admin apparently.
Out of courtesy, pinging @Parsecboy: so he doesn't accuse me of going behind is back or anything (yes, maybe I shouldn't assume this, but my sole interaction so far with a wikipedia user has been "use a childish insult and when I actually engage in discussion accuse me of having vandalised the article for months" so at this point I'm half expecting someone will find an excuse for something else) --2001:8003:1C4D:BA00:32DD:7BEB:BE7B:F68 (talk) 11:29, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Honestly, if I was you, I would just do my best to brush it off and move on to a different article, Matthew 10:14-style. But, if you choose to continue editing the same article, I would continue to be as civil as possible, and if Parsec keeps it up, report it to another admin or something; if he leaves you alone, problem solves. Granted, I'm not an expert on Wikipedia policy, but I hope this helps. Commandant Quacks-a-lot (talk) 17:18, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Since I was pinged - all I'll say is that the odds that two people from the same mid-sized city came to the same, obscure article to argue the same, obscure point are approximately 0. Parsecboy (talk) 17:31, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I saw the youtube video, went to the article going "I wonder if wikipedia has solved this", saw it hadn't, then checked the history thinking "hey, maybe someone proved Drach wrong", in hindsight I probably should have just kept my head down. Though I am still wondering why you're ignoring the point I made that the first guy to edit the article and remove the picture is in the USA, as far as I know that's not part of the "same mid-sized city". --2001:8003:1C4D:BA00:32DD:7BEB:BE7B:F68 (talk) 02:52, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
That dingdong comment was uncivil and unnecessary. If @Parsecboy keeps it up, you can create an incident on the noticeboard. My advice is the same as @Commandant Quacks-a-lot's, however. MmeMaigret (talk) 17:29, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I don't think the Teahouse is the venue for allegations of personal attacks, but regardless, I'm going to ask ‚Äì where is the alleged attack? Coz if it's the "dingdong" bit, then I really don't think there's a case to answer. -- DoubleGrazing (talk) 18:45, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Well, if that's how Wikipedia works then I understand. I apologise for assuming that the "no personal attacks" rule covers childish insults that really don't help civil discussion on the article. --2001:8003:1C4D:BA00:32DD:7BEB:BE7B:F68 (talk) 02:52, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

It varies a lot. Some editors are autopatrolled, so it happens as soon as they create an article. In other cases, the New pages patrol need to be involved and as you can see from that link they are often heavily backlogged. Articles not reviewed after 90 days automatically get marked as being OK for search engines to index. Mike Turnbull (talk) 13:04, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
If you use the AfC process (Articles for Creation), after you submit the article, it should get reviewed by someone (this is different to new pages patrol). But again the process is backlogged and run by volunteers who will do the articles that they feel most qualified to process. There is no fixed time or fixed queue system. If an article that you've written lingers too long unreviewed in AfC you are permitted to bypass the system altogether and move the article to main space yourself. It will then potentially get reviewed by new pages patrol. Alternatively if another editor thinks it's not ready for main space they may nominate it for deletion. This isn't necessarily a disaster, it just means it gets discussed at Articles for Deletion (AfD), a process that usually takes a week or two. Elemimele (talk) 16:39, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Elemimele My understanding is that if the AfC reviewer is not themselves autopatrolled then articles they accept still have to get a review by the NPP before they may be indexed by search engines. Mike Turnbull (talk) 17:36, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Yes! Thank you, I forgot that bit. Elemimele (talk) 20:31, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
How to find sources?[edit]
Where do yall look for sources? Newspapers.com is paid.
Are google and other search engines the only options? 114.79.185.4 (talk) 14:42, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hello, IP user, and welcome to the Teahouse.
Mostly, yes, those are the places. If you have access to a library, you may be able to consult offline sources, eg books, and newspapers archives on microfilm.
If you create an account, and make least 500 edits in Wikipedia over a period of six months, you will then have access to The Wikipedia Library, which includes various paid resources. --ColinFine (talk) 15:58, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Requesting a new article[edit]
Hi - There are some reference to the BBC's Caribbean Service on wikipedia but no page describing it (for instance on Sir Trevor MacDonald's page). I was the launch Editor of the new Caribbean Service in 1988 and have many independent links and sources about it but, since I was closely connected to the Service, I feel I should not write the article. What is the best way of encouraging such an article to be written? Could you advise about this? JerryTimmins (talk) 14:50, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hello, JerryTimmins, and welcome to the Teahouse. Thank you for being open about your connection.
While there is in principle a place to request articles - Requested articles - in practice the chances of any particular request being taken up are low, and you'd do better writing it yourself.
Having said that, writing an article is a challenging task for new editors even (or perhaps especially) for those with experience of other kinds of writing. My earnest advice to new editors is to not even think about
trying to create an article until you have spent several weeks - at least - learning about how Wikipedia works by making improvements to existing articles. Once you have understood core policies such as verifiability, neutral point of view, reliable, independent sources, and notability, and experienced how we handle disagreements with other editors (the Bold, Revert, Discuss cycle), then you might be ready to read your first article carefully, and try creating a draft. If you don't follow this advice but try to create an article without this preparation, you are likely to have a frustrating and disappointing experience with Wikipedia.
Your potential conflict of interest does not preclude you from writing a draft and submitting it for review, using the articles for creation process.
Be aware that, once you have found the multiple reliable, independent sources with significant coverage of the service, you will need to effectively forget everything you know about it, and write a summary of what those sources say - even if you think they are missing something important, possibly even if you think they are wrong: Wikipedia works on verifiability, not truth.
Another approach might be to ask for collaborators on the talk page of WP:WikiProject BBC. --ColinFine (talk) 16:06, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Turkish promo image[edit]

@Jim Wilson Crosby As the messages on your talk page say, it appears that your only past contributions were deleted under what is called speedy deletion.

On Copyright[edit]
So if I upload an image(s) using the Wikipedia:File upload wizard using the button "Upload a non-free file" option on Wikipedia. It would be acceptable and wouldn't violate Wikipedia's rules on copyright. Is this correct?
Rager7 (talk) 17:58, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
It depends. If you go to the upload wizard, you'll see that there's a lot of hoops that one must jump through in order to get the file approved, so you can't upload just any old file you want to. Commandant Quacks-a-lot (talk) 18:13, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The hoops are most likely there to prevent abuse and misuse of copyright.
Rager7 (talk) 20:28, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hello, Rager7 and welcome to the Teahouse.
Yes, provided you can justify using a non-free image. In order to load an image as non-free you will be required to provide a justification, which shows that your use meets all the criteria in the non-free content criteria. Somebody will probably see your upload, and if you have not in fact provided a proper justification, it will get deleted. --ColinFine (talk)

Advice on improving draft after cleanup[edit]
Hi all,
I‚Äôve been working on cleaning up a draft article about Empower Work, a U.S.-based nonprofit. There had been concerns about promotional tone, so I trimmed it back significantly and tried to bring it closer to a neutral stub with citations.
Here‚Äôs the draft: Empower Work
Could you take a look and let me know:
Are there still parts that feel promotional?
Does it look closer to meeting Wikipedia‚Äôs notability and neutrality standards?
Any other suggestions to reduce the risk of deletion?
Thanks in advance! Sfoakbay (talk) 18:07, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Looks good to me, but I'm no expert. Do you have any personal connections to the organization? (I.e., you work for Empower Work, you were helped by them, or you were paid by them to write the article.) Commandant Quacks-a-lot (talk) 18:16, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Sfn & harv[edit]
Hi, friends. I need help because, as always with very "technical or glitchy issues" of references or citations, I do not grasp it fully. I am working on a DYK nomination which I submitted today, and I am a very aesthetic editor, LOL. I think it is great to have books under a different subhead than general references. But I got an error which I don't understand in one of those book citations. Can anybody help me? I've tried myself but I can't decode the error. It's on the article about Lifeboat No. 6 of the Titanic.
Thanks. A lot. Love. CoryGlee (talk) 00:51, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The source Gracie, Archibald; Thayer, John B. (2014). Titanic A Survivor's Story & the Sinking of the S.S. Titanic. Chicago Review Press. ISBN¬†9780897336758. is defined twice, once in the History section and once in the Repeated cited sources section. This means that {{sfn}}, when it's looking for the correct citation, sees two "different" books which could match. You should combine the twin citations by replacing the History citation with {{sfn}} instead.

Ponzo illusion red links[edit]
I was editing Ponzo illusion; there are two red links in the article (perspective hypothesis and framing-effects hypothesis) and I don't know how to resolve them. Could you please suggest a workaround? Thanks.-- Carnby (talk) 07:44, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The links mean there's no existing page. The options are (i) delete the links, (ii) ignore the links, (iii) create the respective pages. Personally, I would lean towards deleting the links. (Also there's no need for the apostrophes in addition to links - so if you keep the links, suggest delete the apostrophes; if you delete the links, keep the apostrophes.) Hope that helps. MmeMaigret (talk) 07:51, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

I have found other two red links for related concepts in Context effect (attractiveness effect and similarity effect). Perhaps some Wikidata items for the moment?-- Carnby (talk) 09:46, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The question is whether the subject ("attractiveness effect" etc.) is likely ever to be an article. If, in your opinion, there are sources and there's a reasonable likelihood an article will one day be written, leave the red wiki-link. If it's a small sideline, with little sourcing, and the chance of anyone writing a stand-alone article is small, I'd de-link it. Elemimele (talk) 12:47, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Having red links is not a bad thing, and it not an error or mistake. If you don't like it, you can remove it. GGOTCC 18:07, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Rejected citations[edit]
Any advice on rejected citations and tone that isn't objective enough?
Courtesy link:¬†Draft:Insurance Insider
hi there, I've had multiple submissions for my business page rejected on ground of the citations lacking depth and it sounding like an advertisement. I feel that I can't do much more on the latter - it simply is written in the most factual, objective way possible as far as I can see. For the former, we operate in a niche market and the value we offer is giving information companies can use in a highly competitive market - so people don't exactly want to mention us at length elsewhere. I don't want the wiki to promote - I just want it to validate we exist and what we do so that as we're expanding into new markets that info is available for people to check that we're a genuine company/service. After three failed draft attempts - where can I turn next? CorrenaCunningham (talk) 12:07, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
First, thank you for disclosing your paid status, many do not do this(either deliberately or otherwise).
You have a fundamental, if common, misunderstanding as to what it is we do here.
You have told us what you want the world to know about your company.
That is the wrong approach. Wikipedia is not a place for a company to tell about itself, its offerings and activities, and what it views as its own history.
A Wikipedia article about a company must summarize what independent reliable sources with siignificant coverage have chosen on their own to say about the company, showing how it meets the special Wikipedia definition of a notable company.
Wikipedia is not interested in what a company says about itself, only in what others wholly unconnected with the company choose to say about it in a significant way- not just its activities or offerings, but coverage that goes in depth as to what makes the subject important/significant/influential as the source sees it, not as the company itself might see it(as most companies see what they do as important).
In order for you to succeed at what you are doing(which does not happen often for those in your position) you need to set aside everything you know about your company and all materials it puts out, all brief mentions and reporting of routine business activities, and limit yourself to summarizing what independent sources say.
People in your position have great difficulty with that; are you the rare person who can do it?
Possibly, but the odds are against it. Please see WP:BOSS and have others at your company read it, too.
If you still want to attempt it, you need to essentially blank the draft and start fresh- if you have at least three independent sources with significant coverage. If you have three such sources, you can tell what they are and we can tell you if this is worth attempting. 331dot (talk) 12:13, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Welcome to the Teahouse, CorrenaCunningham. Related to 331dot's response, rather than writing, as you have, that "Insurance Insider's industry awards, such as the Insurance Insider US Honors, receive coverage in trade publications", a better approach would be to use those trade publications as sources, summarise what they say about Insurance Insider, and cite them.

New editor, question about WP:NPOV[edit]
Hi All,
I was reviewing this article and I came across this passage:
"Students of Nalanda College have consistently participated in national-level examinations, with some achieving high grades in Ordinary Level and Advanced Level exams, as well as in various sports competitions." This passage feels extremely out of place to me, however it has tons of citations on it. There is also an "Awards" section immediately below this that seems address this idea with objective facts.
So do we think this is an appropriate passage? As a new editor, how do I know when a passage is in violation of WP:NPOV if it has citations as well?
TIA,
LuredFreezer LuredFreezer (talk) 16:10, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
As long as the sources are well-referenced, and the references actually back up the information, it seems good to me. It's written in a somewhat braggadocious-seeming way, but it's pretty much just statistics. If you think it could be written in a more encyclopedic way, I invite you to Be Bold and correct it in a manner that you feel is appropriate.
Happy editing!
Commandant Quacks-a-lot (talk) 18:17, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I think maybe NPOV (in its Wikipedia sense) is not exactly the problem, even though neutrality is certainly involved. The issue (if there is one) seems more like WP:COI or WP:Puff, if you think the article is misusing Wikipedia as a promotional tool. (I too would tend to classify this kind of thing as inappropriate promotional material.) TooManyFingers (talk) 18:23, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Thanks to both, this is helpful. I'll noodle on it for a bit and see if I can reword it in a way that feels more fitting for Wikipedia. LuredFreezer (talk) 18:26, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Draft:Sparkrock - Wikipedia OpenKey2195 (talk) 17:13, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@OpenKey2195 In my opinion, the main problem is that the sources you have used are not independent of the company. Please read our advice about the type of sources that are required and see if you can identify three that meet these criteria. If you can, base your draft solely on these. Mike Turnbull (talk) 17:32, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@OpenKey2195 As an AfC approver, another issue is that many of the sentences are uncited. While everything in a paragraph can be supported by one citation at the end, the article consists of many uncited stand-alone sentences. Adding wikilinks would also be helpful. GGOTCC 18:05, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@OpenKey2195 I would go as far as to recommend that you combine many of your standalone sentences into larger paragraphs. In addition, some of your subsections could probably be combined. As is, I'll admit that it does look like an advertisement. But most of the content within looks pretty good and appears to be in a Neutral point of view. And, as @Michael D. Turnbull and @GGOTCC, be sure to work on your sources. Commandant Quacks-a-lot (talk) 18:25, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

The talk page for Blaster (flamethrower) has been unable to show any new messages for a long time.

Wiki-style references with EndNote[edit]
Like many other wiki-editors, I use EndNote to generate a list of references.
Wikipedia has it own hypertext (html) formatting style called wiki-text markup: Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Text formatting
Currently EndNote does not provide such output style.
It would be useful for many wiki-editors (especially, those in academia, who have EndNote license via their institutions) to have an option to easily produce wiki-styled references.
I contacted EndNote techsupport, and they told me- someone from Wikipedia have to place a formal request with endnote.com, and they can release this new wiki-format for free. Do you know, who can place such as official request? In case of scientific journals, EndNote accepts requests
from editorial or publishing offices.

I think you're asking about 90568 Goibniu. If so, then the place where you'd ask about adding material to it is Talk:90568 Goibniu. If you do add material, then the reference you provide for it should not be a "bare URL". -- Hoary (talk) 23:13, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
What to hyperlink[edit]
Should I hyperlink the same thing twice? e.g. if an article mentions France like 3 times, do I hyperlink it all 3 times or just the first time it appears? SomePersonInAHouse (talk) 00:15, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@SomePersonInAHouse The first time it appears in a section. See MOS:OL. In fact, you don't even need to link "France" because it's a well-knwon country. Cremastra (talk¬†¬∑ contribs) 00:22, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
