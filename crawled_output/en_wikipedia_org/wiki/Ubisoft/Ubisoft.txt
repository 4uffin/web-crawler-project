Ubisoft Entertainment SA (/ˈjuːbisɒft/; French: [ybisɔft];[5] formerly Ubi Soft Entertainment SA) is a French video game publisher headquartered in Saint-Mandé with development studios across the world. Its video game franchises include Anno, Assassin's Creed, Driver, Far Cry, Just Dance, Prince of Persia, Rabbids, Rayman, Tom Clancy's, and Watch Dogs.
Ubisoft is led by chairman and CEO Yves Guillemot. The company first achieved commercial and critical success with their 1995 platform game Rayman. In 1996, the company began to expand to other parts of the world, opening studios in Annecy, Shanghai, Montreal and Milan. In recent years, Ubisoft has struggled financially, with a strong decline in revenue in 2024, and laying off 185 employees in 2025.[6][7]
History[edit]
Origins and first decade (1986–1996)[edit]
By the 1980s, the Guillemot family had established itself as a support business for farmers in the Brittany province of France and other regions, including into the United Kingdom. The five sons of the family – Christian, Claude, Gérard, Michel, and Yves – helped with the company's sales, distribution, accounting, and management with their parents before university.
All five gained business experience while at university, which they brought back to the family business after graduating. The brothers came up with the idea of diversification to sell other products of use to farmers; Claude began with selling CD audio media. Later, the brothers expanded to computers and additional software that included video games.[8]
In the 1980s, they saw that the costs of buying computers and software from a French supplier were more expensive than buying the same materials in the United Kingdom and shipping to France, and came upon the idea of a mail-order business around computers and software. Their mother said they could start their own business this way as long as they managed it themselves and equally split its shares among the five of them.
Their first business was Guillemot Informatique, founded in 1984.[9] They originally only sold through mail order, and then were getting orders from French retailers, since they were able to undercut other suppliers by up to 50% of the cost of some titles. By 1986, this company was earning about 40 million French francs (roughly US$5.8 million at that time).[9] In 1985, the brothers established Guillemot Corporation for similar distribution of computer hardware.[9] As demand continued, the brothers recognised that video game software was becoming a lucrative property and decided that they needed to get into the industry's development side, already having insight on the publication and distribution side.[8]
Ubi Soft (formally named Ubi Soft Entertainment S.A.) was founded by the brothers on 28 March 1986.[10][11] The name "Ubi Soft" was selected to represent "ubiquitous" software.[12]
Ubi Soft initially operated out of offices in Paris, moving to Créteil by June 1986.[13][14] The brothers used the chateau in Brittany as the primary space for development, hoping the setting would lure developers, as well as to have a better way to manage expectations of their developers.[8] The company hired Nathalie Saloud as manager, Sylvie Hugonnier as director of marketing and public relations, and programmers, though Hugonnier had left the company by May 1986 to join Elite Software.[15] Games published by Ubi Soft in 1986 include Zombi, Ciné Clap, Fer et Flamme, Masque, and Graphic City, a sprite editing program.[16][17][18][19] As their first game, Zombi had sold 5,000 copies by January 1987.[20][19] Ubi Soft also entered into distribution partnerships for the game to be released in Spain and West Germany.[19] Ubi Soft started importing products from abroad for distribution in France, with 1987 releases including Elite Software's Commando and Ikari Warriors, the former of which sold 15,000 copies by January 1987.[19][21] In 1988, Yves Guillemot was appointed as Ubi Soft's chief executive officer.[11]
By 1988, the company had about 6 developers working from the chateau. These included Michel Ancel, a teenager at the time noted for his animation skills,[8] and Serge Hascoët, who applied to be a video game tester for the company.[22] The costs of maintaining the chateau became more expensive, and the developers were given the option to relocate to Paris. Ancel's family which had moved to Brittany for his job could not afford the cost of living in Paris and returned to Montpellier in southern France. The Guillemot brothers told Ancel to keep them abreast of anything he might come up with there.[8] Ancel returned with Frédéric Houde with a prototype of a game with animated features that caught the brothers' interest. Michel Guillemot decided to make the project a key one for the company, establishing a studio in Montreuil to house over 100 developers in 1994, and targeting a line of 5th generation consoles such as the Atari Jaguar and PlayStation. Their game, Rayman, was released in 1995.[8] Yves managed Guillemot Informatique, making deals with Electronic Arts, Sierra On-Line and MicroProse to distribute their games in France. Guillemot Informatique began expanding to other markets, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany. They entered the video game distribution and wholesale markets and by 1993 had become the largest distributor of video games in France.[23]
Worldwide growth (1996–2003)[edit]
In 1996, Ubi Soft listed its initial public offering and raised over US$80 million in funds to help them to expand the company.[8] Within 2 years, the company established worldwide studios in Annecy (1996), Shanghai (1996), Montreal (1997), and Milan (1998).
A difficulty that the brothers found was the lack of an intellectual property that would have a foothold in the United States market.[8] When "widespread growth" of the Internet arrived around 1999, the brothers decided to take advantage of this by founding game studios aimed at online free-to-play titles, including GameLoft; this allowed them to license the rights to Ubi Soft properties to these companies, increasing the share value of Ubi Soft five-fold. With the extra infusion of €170 million, they were able to then purchase Red Storm Entertainment in 2000, giving them access to the Tom Clancy's series of stealth and spy games.[8] Ubi Soft helped with Red Storm to continue to expand the series, bringing titles like Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon and Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six series.[8] The company got a foothold in the United States when it worked with Microsoft to develop Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell, an Xbox-exclusive title released in 2002 to challenge the PlayStation-exclusive Metal Gear Solid series, by combining elements of Tom Clancy's series with elements of an in-house developed game called The Drift.[8]
In March 2001, Gores Technology Group sold The Learning Company's entertainment division (which included games originally published by Broderbund, Mattel Interactive, Mindscape and Strategic Simulations) to them. The sale included the rights to intellectual properties such as the Myst and Prince of Persia series.[24] Ubisoft Montreal developed the Prince of Persia title into Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time released in 2003.[8] At the same time, Ubi Soft released Beyond Good & Evil, Ancel's project after Rayman; it was one of Ubi Soft's first commercial "flops" on its release but which since has gained a cult following.[8]
Around 2001, Ubi Soft established its editorial department headed by Hascoët, initially named as editor in chief and later known as the company's Chief Content Officer. Hascoët had worked alongside Ancel on Rayman in 1995 to help refine the game, and saw the opportunity to apply that across all of Ubi Soft's games.[25][26] Until 2019, most games published by Ubisoft were reviewed through the editorial department overseen by Hascoët.[27]
Continued expansion (2003–2015)[edit]
The evolution of the Ubisoft logo. The initial logo was created on the company's founding in 1986. With the publication of Rayman, the company used the rainbow shape to show their shift from distributor to a publisher in 1995. The blue "swirl" was introduced in 2003 with the rebranding from "Ubi Soft" to "Ubisoft", alongside their acquisition of the Tom Clancy licence. Another swirl was introduced in 2017, designed to appear as windows into their game worlds while retaining a grain de folie (touch of madness). This excludes the two logos following the 1986 logo and before the 1995 logo.[28]
On 9 September 2003, Ubi Soft announced that it would change its name to Ubisoft, and introduced a new logo known as "the swirl".[29][30] In December 2004, gaming corporation Electronic Arts purchased a 19.9% stake in the firm. Ubisoft referred to the purchase as "hostile" on EA's part.[31] Ubisoft's brothers recognised they had not considered themselves within a competitive market, and employees had feared that an EA takeover would drastically alter the environment within Ubisoft. EA's CEO at the time, John Riccitiello, assured Ubisoft the purchase was not meant as a hostile manoeuvre, and EA ended up selling the shares in 2010.[8]
In February 2005, Ubisoft acquired the NHL Rivals, NFL Fever, NBA Inside Drive and MLB Inside Pitch franchises from Microsoft Game Studios.[32] On January 8, 2009, Square Enix signed an agreement with Ubisoft where the former would work to assist the latter in distributing their video games in Japan.[33]
Ubisoft established another IP, Assassin's Creed, first launched in 2007; Assassin's Creed was originally developed by Ubisoft Montreal as a sequel to Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time and instead transitioned to a story about Assassins and the Templar Knights.[8] In July 2006, Ubisoft bought the Driver franchise from Atari for a sum of €19 million in cash for the franchise, technology rights, and most assets. Within 2008, Ubisoft made a deal with Tom Clancy for perpetual use of his name and intellectual property for video games and other auxiliary media.[34] In July 2008, Ubisoft made the acquisition of Hybride Technologies, a Piedmont-based studio. In November 2008, Ubisoft acquired Massive Entertainment from Activision.[35] In January 2013, Ubisoft acquired South Park: The Stick of Truth from THQ for $3.265 million.
Ubisoft announced plans in 2013 to invest $373 million into its Quebec operations over 7 years. The publisher is investing in the expansion of its motion capture technologies and consolidating its online games operations and infrastructure in Montreal. By 2020, the company would employ more than 3,500 staff at its studios in Montreal and Quebec City.[36] In February 2013, it began offering games from third-party publisher including Electronic Arts and Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment on Uplay and its own games to EA's Origin.[37]
In July 2013, Ubisoft announced a breach in its network resulting in the potential exposure of up to 58 million accounts including usernames, email address, and encrypted passwords. The firm denied any credit/debit card information could have been compromised, issued directives to all registered users to change their account passwords, and recommended updating passwords on any other website or service where a same or similar password had been used.[38] All the users who registered were emailed by the Ubisoft company about the breach and a password change request. Ubisoft promised to keep the information safe.[39]
In March 2015, the company set up a Consumer Relationship Centre in Newcastle-upon-Tyne. The centre is intended to integrate consumer support teams and community managers. Consumer Support and Community Management teams at the CRC are operational 7 days a week.[40]
Attempted takeover by Vivendi (2015–2018)[edit]
Since around 2015, the French mass media company Vivendi has been seeking to expand its media properties through acquisitions and other business deals. In addition to advertising firm Havas, Ubisoft was one of the first target properties identified by Vivendi, which as of September 2017 has an estimated valuation of $6.4 billion.[41][42] Vivendi, in two actions during October 2015, bought shares in Ubisoft stock, giving them a 10.4% stake in Ubisoft, an action that Yves Guillemot considered "unwelcome" and feared a hostile takeover.[43] In a presentation during the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2016, Yves Guillemot stressed the importance that Ubisoft remain an independent company to maintain its creative freedom.[44] Guillemot later described the need to fight off the takeover: "...when you're attacked with a company that has a different philosophy, you know it can affect what you've been creating from scratch. So you fight with a lot of energy to make sure it can't be destroyed."[45] Vice-president of Live Operations, Anne Blondel-Jouin, expressed similar sentiment in an interview with PCGamesN, stating that Ubisoft's success was partly due to "...being super independent, being very autonomous."[46][47]
Vivendi acquired stake in mobile game publisher Gameloft, owned by the Guillemots, and started acquiring Ubisoft shares.[48][43] In the following February, Vivendi acquired €500 million worth of shares in Gameloft, gaining more than 30% of the shares and requiring the company under French law to make a public tender offer; this action enabled Vivendi to complete the takeover of Gameloft by June 2016.[49][50][51] Following Vivendi's actions with Gameloft in February 2016, the Guillemots asked for more Canadian investors in the following February to fend off a similar Vivendi takeover;[52][53][54] by this point, Vivendi had increased their share in Ubisoft to 15%, exceeding the estimated 9% that the Guillemots owned.[50][52] By June 2016, Vivendi had increased its shares to 20.1% and denied it was in the process of a takeover.[55]
By the time of Ubisoft's annual board meeting in September 2016, Vivendi had gained 23% of the shares, while the Guillemots were able to increase their voting share to 20%. A request was made at the board meeting to place Vivendi representatives on Ubisoft's board, given the size of their shareholdings. The Guillemots argued against this, reiterating that Vivendi should be seen as a competitor, and succeeded in swaying other voting members to deny any board seats to Vivendi.[56]
Vivendi continued to buy shares in Ubisoft, approaching the 30% mark that could trigger a takeover; as of December 2016, Vivendi held a 25.15% stake in Ubisoft.[57] Reuters reported in April 2017 that Vivendi's takeover of Ubisoft would likely happen that year[41] and Bloomberg Businessweek observed that some of Vivendi's shares would reach the 2-year holding mark, which would grant them double voting power, and would likely meet or exceed the 30% threshold.[58] The Guillemot family has since raised its stake in Ubisoft; as of June 2017, the family held 13.6% of Ubisoft's share capital, and 20.02% of the company's voting rights.[59] In October 2017, Ubisoft announced it reached a deal with an "investment services provider" to help them purchase back 4 million shares by the end of the year, preventing others, specifically Vivendi, from buying these.[60]
In the week before Vivendi would gain double-voting rights for previously purchased shares, the company, in quarterly results published in November 2017, announced that it had no plans to acquire Ubisoft for the next 6 months, nor would seek board positions due to the shares they held during that time, and that it "would ensure that its interest in Ubisoft would not exceed the threshold of 30% through the doubling of its voting rights." Vivendi remained committed to expanding in the video game sector, identifying that their investment in Ubisoft could represent a capital gain of over 1 billion euros.[61]
On 20 March 2018, Ubisoft and Vivendi struck a deal ending any potential takeover, with Vivendi agreeing to sell all of its shares, over 30 million, to other parties and agreeing to not buy any Ubisoft shares for 5 years. Some of those shares were sold to Tencent, which after the transaction held about 5.6 million shares of Ubisoft (approximately 5% of all shares).[62] The same day, Ubisoft announced a partnership with Tencent to help bring their games onto the Chinese market.[63] Vivendi completely divested its shares in Ubisoft by March 2019.[64][65]
Investment by Tencent (2018–2022)[edit]
Since 2018, Ubisoft's studios have continued to focus on some franchises, including Assassin's Creed, Tom Clancy's, Far Cry, and Watch Dogs. As reported by Bloomberg Businessweek, while Ubisoft as a whole had nearly 16,000 developers by mid-2019, larger than some of its competitors, and producing 5 to 6 major AAA releases each year compared to the 2 or 3 from the others, the net revenue earned per employee was the lowest of the 4 due to generally lower sales of its games.[citation needed] Bloomberg Business attributed this partially due to spending trends by video game consumers purchasing fewer games with long playtimes, as most of Ubisoft's major releases tend to be. To counter this, Ubisoft in October 2019 postponed 3 of the 6 titles it had planned in 2019 to 2020 or later, as to help place more effort on improving the quality of the existing and released games.[66] Due to overall weak sales in 2019, Ubisoft stated in January 2020 that it would be reorganizing its editorial board to provide a more comprehensive look at its game portfolio and devise greater variation in its games which Ubisoft's management said had fallen stagnant, too uniform and had contributed to weak sales.[67]
Stemming from a wave of sexual misconduct accusations of the #MeToo movement in June and July 2020, Ubisoft had a number of employees accused of misconduct from both internal and external sources. Between Ubisoft's internal investigation and a study by the newspaper Libération, employees had been found to have records of sexual misconduct and troubling behaviour, going back up to 10 years, which had been dismissed by the human resources departments. As a result, some Ubisoft staff either quit or were fired, including Hascoët, Maxime Béland, the co-founder of Ubisoft Toronto, and Yannis Mallat, the managing director of Ubisoft's Canadian studios.[68][22] Yves Guillemot implemented changes in the company to address these issues as it further investigated the extent of the misconduct claims.[69]
Ubisoft stated in its end of 2020 fiscal year investor call in February 2021 that the company will start to make AAA game releases less of a focus and put more focus on mobile and freemium games following fiscal year 2022. CFO Frederick Duguet stated to investors that "we see that we are progressively, continuously moving from a model that used to be only focused on AAA releases to a model where we have a combination of strong releases from AAA and strong back catalog dynamics, but also complimenting our program of new releases with free-to-play and other premium experiences."[70] Later that year, the company announced it would start branding games developed by its first-party developers as "Ubisoft Originals".[71]
In 2021, they announced that they would be making an open world Star Wars game.[72] The deal marked an end to EA's exclusive rights to make Star Wars titles. In October 2021, Ubisoft participated in a round of financing in Animoca Brands.[73]
In November 2021, Ubisoft announced the development of their first Ubisoft Entertainment Center, created by experience design firm Storyland Studios and Alterface. The first location is set to open in Studios Occitanie Méditerranée by 2025.[74]
Ubisoft has been increasingly involved in blockchain-based video games since the later 2010s. The company is a co-founder of the Blockchain Game Alliance, which was established in September 2018[75][76] and is a consortium of several companies active in the blockchain space that seeks to explore the potential applications of this technology in the video game industry and publicly promotes the use of blockchain-based content in video games.[77] According to Yves Guillemot, one of Ubisoft's co-founders, crypto-based content in video games will allow players to actually own digital content within it, while growing the video game industry in the process.[76] Ubisoft furthermore announced its Ubisoft Quartz blockchain program in December 2021, allowing players to buy uniquely identified customization items for games and then sell and trade them based on the Tezos currency, which Ubisoft claimed was an energy efficient cryptocurrency. This marked the first "AAA" effort into blockchain games.[78] The announcement was heavily criticized by audiences, with the Quartz announcement video attaining a dislike ratio of 96% on YouTube. Ubisoft subsequently unlisted the video from YouTube.[79][80] The announcement was also criticized internally by Ubisoft developers.[81][82]
In July 2022, Ubisoft announced that it had cancelled Splinter Cell VR and Ghost Recon Frontline, along with two other unannounced titles.[83] In September, Tencent invested another €300 million into Guillemot Brothers Limited, the company that holds part of the Guillemots' ownership of Ubisoft. This gave Tencent 49.9% ownership in this holding company and increased the Guillemots' share of voting rights within Ubisoft to about 30%. Yves Guillemot said that Tencent would be working closely with Ubisoft, helping to bring their games into China while assisting in paying off Ubisoft's debts and preventing the company from potential buyouts.[84]
Financial concerns and reorganization (2023–present)[edit]
Citing disappointing financial results in the previous quarter, Ubisoft cancelled another three previously unannounced games in January 2023.[85] In an email to staff, Yves Guillemot told employees to take responsibility for the company's forthcoming projects, asking that "each of you be especially careful and strategic with your spending and initiatives, to ensure we're being as efficient and lean as possible", while also saying that "The ball is in your court to deliver this line-up on time and at the expected level of quality, and show everyone what we are capable of achieving."[86][87] Union workers at Ubisoft Paris took issue with this message, calling for a strike and demanding higher salaries and improved working conditions.[88]
In August 2023, Ubisoft announced that it had reached a 15-year agreement with Microsoft to license the cloud gaming rights to Activision Blizzard titles; this came as part of efforts by Microsoft to receive approval from the UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) for its acquisition of Activision Blizzard. The agreement would allow Activision Blizzard games to appear on Ubisoft+, and allow Ubisoft to sublicense the cloud gaming rights for the games to third-parties.[89][90]
As part of a cost reduction plan, Ubisoft reduced its number of employees from 20,279 in 2022 to 19,410 in September 2023.[91] In November 2023, Ubisoft laid off 124 employees from its VFX and IT teams.[92] In March 2024, Ubisoft laid off 45 employees from its publishing teams.[93] Another 45 employees were cut between its San Francisco and Cary, North Carolina offices in August 2024.[94] By the end of September 2024, Ubisoft had reduced its number of employees to 18,666.[95]
In 2024, Ubisoft released multiple games that experienced underperforming sales and declining playerbases post-launch, which included Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, Skull and Bones, XDefiant, and Star Wars Outlaws, causing its stock to fall to nearly its lowest levels in the previous decade.[96] As a result, the company announced they were launching an investigation of their development cycles to focus on a "player-centric approach", and opted to delay its next major flagship game, Assassin's Creed Shadows, from November 2024 to February 2025.[97]
On 16 October 2024, over 700 Ubisoft employees in France began a three-day strike, protesting the company's requirement to return to the office three days a week. The strike, organized by the STJV union, involved Ubisoft's offices in Paris, Montpellier, Lyon, and Annecy. Workers expressed dissatisfaction over a lack of flexibility, salary increases, and profit-sharing, which they believe the company has ignored. Ubisoft has yet to address the union's concerns.[98]
In December 2024, Ubisoft announced that their free-to-play game XDefiant would be shutting down in June 2025, less than a year after its initial release.[99] They also announced that its lead development studio Ubisoft San Francisco, and Ubisoft Osaka, were to close, resulting in up to 277 employees being laid off.[100]
In January 2025, Ubisoft closed the Ubisoft Leamington studio and downsized several other studios, resulting in up to 185 staff being laid off as part of ongoing cost-cutting measures.[101][102]
Around September 2024, one of Ubisoft's shareholders, AJ Investments, stated they were seeking to have the company purchased by a private equity firm and would push out the Guillemot family and Tencent from ownership of the company.[103] Bloomberg News reported in October 2024 that the Guillemots and Tencent were considering this and other alternatives to shift ownership of the company in light of the recent poor financial performance.[104] Later reports in December 2024 suggested that Tencent was seeking to capture a majority stake in Ubisoft and take the company private, while still giving the Guillemot family control of Ubisoft.[105] In January 2025, it was reported that the Guillemots had also considered carving out certain Ubisoft assets into a new subsidiary, which would allow Tencent to make targeted investments to increase the company's overall value.[106] Ubisoft announced this subsidiary on 27 March 2025, devoted to its flagship Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six franchises; the subsidiary will consist of the franchises' assets and development teams, and have dedicated leadership. Tencent will make a €1.16 billion investment in the new subsidiary, giving it a 25% stake at a valuation of €4 billion; the value of this subsidiary is larger than the current valuation of Ubisoft, which is based on Tencent's belief that these properties are undervalued. Ubisoft stated that the subsidiary would "focus on building game ecosystems designed to become truly evergreen and multi-platform". The transaction is expected to be completed by the end of 2025.[107][108][109] Ubisoft selected Christophe Derennes and Charlie Guillemot to be co-CEOs of the new subsidiary in July 2025.[110] With its financial quarterly report on July 2025, Ubisoft stated that it will reorganize into "creative houses" that will "enhance quality, focus, autonomy and accountability while fostering closer connections with players", with the previously announced Tencent-backed subsidiary as an example of such a division.[111] At the end of August, Ubisoft sold the rights to five of their titles, including Grow Home and Cold Fear, to Atari SA.[112]

Technology[edit]
Ubisoft Connect[edit]
Main article: Ubisoft Connect
Ubisoft Connect, formerly Uplay, is a digital distribution, digital rights management, multiplayer and communications service for PC created by Ubisoft. First launched alongside Assassin's Creed II as a rewards program to earn points towards in-game content for completing achievements within Ubisoft, it expanded into a desktop client and storefront for Windows machine alongside other features. Ubisoft then separated the rewards program out as its Ubisoft Club program, integrated with Uplay. Ubisoft Connect was announced in October 2020 as a replacement for UPlay and its Ubisoft Club to launch on 29 October 2020 alongside Watch Dogs: Legion. Connect replaces UPlay and the club's previous functions while adding support for cross-platform play and save progression for some games. It includes the same reward progression system that the Club offered to gain access to in-game content.[159] Some games on the UPlay service will not be updated to support these reward features that they previously had under the Ubisoft Club; for those, Ubisoft will unlock all rewards for all players.[160]
Uplay/Ubisoft Connect serves to manage the digital rights for Ubisoft's games on Windows computers, which has led to criticism when it was first launched, as some games required always-on digital rights management, causing loss of save game data should players lose their Internet connection. The situation was aggravated after Ubisoft's servers were struck with denial of service attacks that made the Ubisoft games unplayable due to this DRM scheme. Ubisoft eventually abandoned the always-on DRM scheme and still require all Ubisoft games to perform a start-up check through Uplay/Ubisoft Connect servers when launched.[161][162][163][164]
Game engines[edit]
Ubisoft Anvil[edit]
Main article: Ubisoft Anvil
Ubisoft Anvil, formerly named Scimitar, is a proprietary game engine developed wholly within Ubisoft Montreal in 2007 for the development of the first Assassin's Creed game and has since been expanded and used for most Assassin's Creed titles and other Ubisoft games, including Ghost Recon Wildlands, Ghost Recon Breakpoint and For Honor.[165]
Disrupt[edit]
The Disrupt game engine was developed by Ubisoft Montreal and is used for the Watch Dogs games.[166][167][168][169] Developer Ubisoft Montreal spent four years creating the engine.[170][171] The majority of Disrupt was built from scratch and uses a multithreaded renderer, running on fully deferred physically based rendering pipeline with some technological twists to allow for more advanced effects.[172][173] The engine also has a feature that allows players to connect and disconnect their game from others without causing major disruptions in the game environment or storyline progress.[174] Its open world city management comes from AnvilNext while its vegetation and AI are from Dunia.[175] Parts of the engine were originally intended for another game in the Driver franchise.[176][177]
Dunia[edit]
The Dunia engine is a software fork of the CryEngine that was originally developed by Crytek, with modifications made by Ubisoft Montreal. The CryEngine at the time could render some outdoor environmental spaces. Crytek had created a demo of its engine called X-Isle: Dinosaur Island which it had demonstrated at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 1999. Ubisoft saw the demo and had Crytek build out the demo into a full title, becoming the first Far Cry, released in 2004.[178] That year, Electronic Arts established a deal with Crytek to build a wholly different title with an improved version of the CryEngine, leaving them unable to continue work on Far Cry.[179] Ubisoft assigned Ubisoft Montreal to develop console versions of Far Cry, and arranging with Crytek to have all rights to the Far Cry series and a perpetual licence on the CryEngine.[180]
In developing Far Cry 2, Ubisoft Montreal modified the CryEngine to include destructible environments and a more realistic physics engine. This modified version became the Dunia engine which premiered with Far Cry 2 in 2008.[181][182] The Dunia engine continued to be improved, such as adding weather systems, and used as the basis of all future Far Cry games, and Avatar: The Game, developed by Ubisoft Montreal.[183][184]
Ubisoft introduced the Dunia 2 engine first in Far Cry 3 in 2012,[185] which was made to improve the performance of Dunia-based games on consoles and to add more complex rendering features such as global illumination.[186][187] The Dunia 2 engine was further refined in Far Cry 4,[188][189] and Far Cry 5.[190][191] According to Remi Quenin, one of the engine's architects at Ubisoft Montreal, the state of the Dunia engine by 2017 included "vegetation, fire simulation, destruction, vehicles, systemic AI, wildlife, weather, day/night cycles, [and] non linear storytelling" which are elements of the Far Cry games.[192] For Far Cry 6, Ubisoft introduced more features to the Dunia 2 engine such as ray tracing support on the PC version,[193][194] and support for AMD's open source variable resolution technology, FidelityFX Super Resolution.[195][196] Aside from the main entries in the Far Cry series, the Dunia 2 engine is also used in the spin-off games. These include Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon,[197] Far Cry Primal,[198][199] and Far Cry New Dawn.[200]
Snowdrop[edit]
Main article: Snowdrop (game engine)
The Snowdrop game engine was co-developed by Massive Entertainment and Ubisoft for Tom Clancy's The Division.[201][202] The core of the game engine is powered by a "node-based system" which simplifies the process of connecting different systems like rendering, AI, mission scripting and the user interface.[203][204] The engine is also used in other Ubisoft games such as South Park: The Fractured but Whole,[205] Mario + Rabbids: Kingdom Battle,[206] Starlink: Battle for Atlas,[207] Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora,[208][209] and Star Wars Outlaws.[210][211]
Games[edit]
Main article: List of Ubisoft games
According to Guillemot, Ubisoft recognised that connected sandbox games, with seamless switches between single and multiplayer modes provided the players with more fun, leading the company to switch from pursuing single-player only games to internet connected ones.[212] According to Guillemot, Ubisoft internally refers to its reimagined self as 'before The Division' and an 'after The Division'.[212]
In an interview with The Verge, Anne Blondel-Jouin, executive producer of The Crew turned vice-president of live operations,[212][213] noted that The Crew was an early game of Ubisoft's to require a persistent internet connection in order to play.[212] This raised concerns for gamers and internally at the company.[212]
Film and television[edit]
In 1999, 12 years before the founding of Ubisoft Film & Television, a 3D animated Rayman series known as Rayman: The Animated Series was produced to help promote Rayman 2: The Great Escape, which was released the same year. The series was produced in-house by Ubisoft. In 2011, Ubisoft initiated its Ubisoft Film & Television division (then named Ubisoft Motion Pictures). Initially developing media works tied to Ubisoft's games, it has since diversified to other works including about video games. Productions include the live-action film Assassin's Creed (2016) and the series Rabbids Invasion (2013–2022) and Mythic Quest (2020–2025).
Litigation[edit]
2020 sexual misconduct accusations and dismissals[edit]

Other lawsuits[edit]
In 2008, Ubisoft sued Optical Experts Manufacturing (OEM), a DVD duplication company for $25 million plus damages for the leak and distribution of the PC version of Assassin's Creed. The lawsuit claims that OEM did not take proper measures to protect its product as stated in its contract with Ubisoft. The complaint alleges that OEM admitted to all the problems in the complaint.[214]
In April 2012, Ubisoft was sued by John L. Beiswenger, the author of the book Link who alleged copyright infringement for using his ideas in the Assassin's Creed franchise. He demanded $5.25 million in damages and a halt to the release of Assassin's Creed III which was set to be released in October 2012, along with any future games that allegedly contain his ideas.[215] On 30 May 2012, Beiswenger dropped the lawsuit. Beiswenger was later quoted as saying he believes "authors should vigorously defend their rights in their creative works", and suggested that Ubisoft's motion to block future lawsuits from Beiswenger hints at their guilt.[216][217][failed verification]
In December 2014, Ubisoft offered a free game from their catalogue of recently released titles to compensate the season pass owners of Assassin's Creed Unity due to its buggy launch. The terms offered with the free game revoked the user's right to sue Ubisoft for the buggy launch of the game.[218]
In May 2020, Ubisoft sued Chinese developer Ejoy and Apple and Google over Ejoy's Area F2 game which Ubisoft contended was a carbon copy of Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege. Ubisoft sought copyright action against Ejoy, and financial damages against Apple and Google for allowing Area F2 to be distributed on their mobile app stores and profiting from its microtransactions.[219]
In November 2024, two Californians—Matthew Cassell and Alan Liu—filed a class action lawsuit against Ubisoft in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California, after Ubisoft announced the shutdown of The Crew servers. Cassell and Liu accused the company of misleading players into believing that their purchases of the game were permanent instead of buying limited licenses and for "falsely represent[ing]" that the physical copies contained the game's files instead of simply a key to unlock the DRM for the game.[220][221]
