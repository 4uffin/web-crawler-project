The women's 400 metres hurdles at the 2022 World Athletics Championships was held over three rounds at Hayward Field in Eugene, Oregon, United States, from 19 to 22 July 2022. It was the nineteenth time that this event was contested at the World Athletics Championships. Athletes could qualify by running the entry standard of 55.40 seconds or faster, by winning selected competitions, or by their position on the World Athletics Rankings.
Thirty-seven athletes from twenty-six nations competed in round 1, where twenty-four athletes advanced to the semi-finals. In the semi-finals, eight athletes advanced to the final, including Gianna Woodruff of Panama, who set a South American record of 53.69 s; Ayomide Folorunso of Italy and Viivi Lehikoinen of Finland set national records, but did not advance. The final was won by Sydney McLaughlin of the United States in a world record of 50.68 s, followed by Femke Bol of the Netherlands in second place in 52.27 s and Dalilah Muhammad of the United States in third place in 53.13 s.
McLaughlin's world record race was called "one of the greatest track performances of all time".[1] At the time, it had the largest relative margin between a world record and the next-fastest athlete's time of any track event.
Background[edit]
Hayward Field in July 2022
In the 400 metres hurdles, athletes run one lap on a 400-metre track while jumping over ten hurdles.[2] The women's world championship in this event was introduced in 1980 and had been contested eighteen times at the World Athletics Championships before 2022.[3]
Initially scheduled for 2021, these championships were postponed to 2022, following the postponement of the 2020 Summer Olympics to 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[4] They were held at the University of Oregon's Hayward Field in Eugene, Oregon, United States, that had been renovated in 2018–2020.[5]
At the start of these championships, Sydney McLaughlin held the world record of 51.41 s set at the 2022 USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships on 25 June 2022, which was the world leading performance of the 2022 season until then, and Dalilah Muhammad held the championship record of 52.16 s set at the 2019 World Athletics Championships on 4 October 2019 and was the defending champion.[6]

Final[edit]
Sydney McLaughlin with Legend the Bigfoot, the championships mascot,[17] after setting a world record in the final
Femke Bol with her silver medal
Eight athletes from five nations competed in the final on 22 July in the evening, starting at 19:50 (UTC−7). After 100 metres, Sydney McLaughlin of the United States was ahead of the other runners, followed by Dalilah Muhammad of the United States and Femke Bol of the Netherlands. In the second 100 metres, McLaughlin continued to lead the race, while Bol had passed Muhammad. In the last 200 metres of the race, McLaughlin, Bol, and Muhammad kept hurdling in this order. McLaughlin won the race, improving her own world record (WR) with 0.73 s to 50.68 s, Bol finished in second place equalling her season's best performance (=SB) of 52.27 s and Muhammad finished in third place with a season's best performance (SB) of 53.13 s.[18][19]
Scott Cacciola of The New York Times wrote that McLaughlin "broke the world record for the fourth time in two years, demolishing a deep and decorated field".[20] Amy Tennery of Reuters said that McLaughlin "produced one of the greatest track performances of all time (...) by shattering her own 400 metres hurdles world record".[1] Scott M. Reid of The Orange County Register thought that McLaughlin's performance was "worthy of the sport's ultimate compliment – Beamonesque".[21] And Euan Crumley of Athletics Weekly wrote as a headline for his report of the final: "McLaughlin produces another moment of real magic".[22] Jon Mulkeen of World Athletics calculated that the margin between McLaughlin's time and that of the next-fastest athlete of all time was 1.78%, the largest relative margin of all track world records at the time.[23]
In an interview after the race, McLaughlin said: "The time is absolutely amazing and the sport is getting faster and faster. Just figuring out what barriers can be broken. I only get faster from here. I executed the race the way Bobby wanted me to. I knew coming home that if I just kept my cadence and stayed on stride pattern, we could do it and it happened."[24] Bol said: "I ran against the best in the world, Sydney is just very strong. She was so far in front at the end, so I was always doubting if I really had a good race because it felt very good. Then I saw the time and I was like: 'Wow'. It is amazing to be a part of it and to come out second in such a race."[24] Muhammad said: "I'm having mixed emotions, to be honest. It's great to get a medal but I came into these championships on the strength of having always gotten a medal at any championships, despite any injuries. But as a competitor, you always want more."[24]
