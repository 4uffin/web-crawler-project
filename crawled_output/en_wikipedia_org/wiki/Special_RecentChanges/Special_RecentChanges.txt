Paixien talk contribs (Changed “… Catholic University College cultivates an active and engaging community...”
to
“… a Catholic university or college cultivates an active and engaging community...”
— “Catholic University College” (capitalized) sounds like a name of a particular institution, but Googling found neither a school named that nor a page w/that paragraph (which I thought might be from a particular college catalog). My changes make it sound generally applicable & appropriate to this article’s broad focus.) Tags: Visual edit Mobile edit Mobile web edit
