193.187.3.11 talk (Thank you for your feedback. I understand that personal analyses—such as my own voice comparison using PRAAT, which suggests Gus Backus as the lead vocalist—aren’t acceptable as citations under Wikipedia’s sourcing guidelines.
My intention was to reflect the ambiguity found in various sources: while some mention Norman Wright, others point to Gus Backus. I’m currently looking for a reliable, published source to support a neutral phrasing that acknowledges both possibilities.)
