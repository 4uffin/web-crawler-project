2003 (MMIII) was a common year starting on Wednesday of the Gregorian calendar, the 2003rd year of the Common Era (CE) and Anno Domini (AD) designations, the 3rd
year of the 3rd millennium and the 21st century, and the
4th
year of the 2000s decade. Calendar year
The year 2003 was marked by the invasion of Iraq and the subsequent period of occupation and insurgency. The Kashmir conflict also saw a period of escalation, and the Second Intifada continued in Israel and Palestine. The global economy recovered from the early 2000s recession, especially in China, Japan, and the United States, and Argentina recovered from its years-long economic crisis. A conference of World Trade Organization members caused diplomatic conflict between developing and developed nations, with the former creating their own trade bloc, the G20 developing nations. The Catholic Church celebrated the 25th anniversary of the election of Pope John Paul II, while disputes about gay rights emerged within several Christian denominations in 2003. The Islamic world faced crisis as the war on terror and Islamic terrorism prompted religious leaders to define Islam's identity. Elsewhere in the world, ten nations were approved for membership to the European Union, North Korea restarted its nuclear weapons program, and several political leaders were convicted in the International Criminal Tribunals for Rwanda and for the former Yugoslavia. The International Criminal Court also began operation in 2003.
The 110th element of the periodic table was officially named darmstadtium (Ds) in 2003. The Human Genome Project announced that it had finished mapping the human genome, while controversies regarding human cloning and genetically modified crops caused political turmoil around the scientific community. A new dinosaur, Rajasaurus narmadensis, was described. Space travel was affected by the explosion of the Space Shuttle Columbia that killed seven astronauts, while a close approach from Mars allowed several landers and rovers to be launched toward the planet. Consumers saw the launch of the iTunes Store and the publication of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, while products like camera phones, 64-bit computers, LCD television, and broadband internet achieved widespread popularity. Email spam became a growing problem in 2003, leading to legislation in several countries.
The year 2003 tied with 2002 as the second-hottest year on record. SARS became an epidemic for several months in 2003, centered in Guangdong and Hong Kong, while concerns about polio and measles outbreaks in West Africa and Uganda, respectively, led to massive child vaccination drives that saw entire populations inoculated. The city of Bam, Iran, was almost entirely destroyed in 2003 following a magnitude 6.6 earthquake.
Population[edit]
The world population on January 1, 2003, was estimated to be 6.272 billion people and increased to 6.353 billion people by January 1, 2004.[1] An estimated 134.0 million births and 52.5 million deaths took place in 2003.[1] The average global life expectancy was 67.1 years, an increase of 0.3 years from 2002.[1] There were approximately 10.6 million global refugees at the beginning of 2003, and the number was reduced to 9.7 million refugees by the end of the year.[2] Afghanistan was the largest source of refugees, with a total of 2.1 million at the end of the year.[2]
Conflicts[edit]
Further information: Category:Conflicts in 2003
American and West African soldiers were deployed in Liberia as a joint task force in the Second Liberian Civil War.
There were 29 armed conflicts in 2003 that caused at least 25 fatalities.[3]: 625  The deadliest conflicts were the invasion of Iraq, the Kashmir insurgency, the Second Liberian Civil War, the Nepalese Civil War, and the War in Darfur.[3]: 627
The European Union engaged in its first military operation when it sent peacekeepers to Macedonia and its first operation outside of Europe when it sent 1,500 soldiers to enforce a ceasefire in the Democratic Republic of the Congo until operations were taken over by the UN mission MONUSCO. NATO launched its first operation outside of Europe or North America when it took command of the International Security Assistance Force in the fight against Afghan insurgencies.[4]: 250–251  ECOWAS peacekeepers and American marines were deployed to Liberia when civil war resumed in August, until the United Nations Mission in Liberia took over operations in September.[4]: 251
Internal conflicts[edit]
Multiple civil wars were ongoing in Africa. The First Ivorian Civil War was halted in 2003 amid a ceasefire while France and the states of ECOWAS intervened. Peace talks fell apart on March 7 until the ceasefire was restored on May 3, only to be broken again on September 23. The war was left in a frozen state at the end of 2003 with rebels controlling parts of the country.[5]: 115–116  The Second Liberian Civil War against Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy escalated when the Movement for Democracy in Liberia split off as its own faction.[5]: 116  President Charles Taylor resigned on August 2, allowing a peace agreement to take place on August 18.[5]: 118  The Second Sudanese Civil War escalated as new militant groups joined the conflict,[3]: 628  though a security agreement was reached between the National Islamic Front and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement on September 25.[5]: 119
In Asia, the Indonesian insurgency in Aceh escalated when a demilitarization agreement failed and the government renewed its offensive in May.[5]: 126  Indonesia declared martial law and launched an attack against the Free Aceh Movement, killing at least 1,100 and capturing another 2,000 out of the movement's total 5,000 members.[4]: 250  The Moro conflict in the Philippines deescalated when the Philippine government agreed to peace talks with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front in July, though conflicts with other groups continued.[5]: 129  A truce between Nepal and Maoist rebels held until conflict resumed in August. Australia deployed 2,000 soldiers to the Solomon Islands in July as a response to internal unrest.[4]: 250  The Sri Lankan Civil War continued in 2003 as peace talks failed, and long-running civil wars in Burundi and in Uganda both escalated.[5]: 107–112
The Colombian conflict against two Marxist militant groups—the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia and the National Liberation Army—escalated in 2003.[5]: 101  The government negotiated an agreement for the right-wing militant group United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia to disband as a means to deescalate the conflict.[5]: 102  The Second Chechen War continued in Russia: the Russian government held a referendum for a new Chechen constitution and offered amnesty for Chechen rebels, but terror attacks continued.[5]: 125
International conflicts[edit]
The government of Saddam Hussein was toppled following the invasion of Iraq.
A coalition of countries led by the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia led an invasion of Iraq beginning on March 20, warning that Iraq had been operating a program to develop weapons of mass destruction. The subsequent Iraq War became the most publicized conflict in 2003.[3]: 627–628  The coalition quickly defeated the Iraqi Armed Forces, and American president George W. Bush gave a speech on May 1 declaring victory in the war.[6]: 2  The subsequent Iraqi insurgency proved more deadly than the invasion by the end of the year.[6]: 3  The most significant insurgency action was a bombing on August 19 that targeted United Nations personnel in Baghdad, killing UN Special Representative Sérgio Vieira de Mello among many others.[4]: 209  Doubts were raised throughout the year whether Iraq had been developing the weapons of which it was accused.[6]: 3  The other war between sovereign states, the Kashmir conflict between India and Pakistan, slowed until a bombing in Mumbai killed 52 people.[4]: 250  A ceasefire took effect on November 23.[5]: 95
The Second Intifada continued into 2003 as conflict between Israel and Palestine killed 400 people in suicide bombings by Palestinians and military strikes by the Israel Defense Forces.[5]: 104  Israel constructed the West Bank barrier, which it described as a measure to prevent suicide bombings and Palestine described as a measure to impose segregation.[7]: 76  Israel also launched bombings against Lebanon and Syria following attacks in Israel.[4]: 250  Al-Qaeda remained active in the Middle East, launching suicide bombings in Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey, as well as Morocco in North Africa. On September 10, its leaders Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri released their first video statement since 2001, celebrating the September 11 attacks. Al-Qaeda figures Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and Riduan Isamuddin were captured in March and August, respectively.[7]: 74
Culture[edit]
Art and architecture[edit]
The Amber Room of Catherine Palace was reconstructed in 2003.
The most widely publicized art exhibition in 2003 was the 50th Venice Biennale,[4]: 157  while the most heavily attended exhibitions were for Leonardo da Vinci and Thomas Struth, both held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art where they attracted thousands of visitors each day.[6]: 525  The "Rembrandt's Journey" collected various Rembrandt works, including etchings and drawings, at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.[4]: 159  The 7000 Years of Persian Art tour took place as a rare international collaboration from the National Museum of Iran.[6]: 525  Street photography made a return in the art community, and the International Center of Photography held an exhibition on the subject.[4]: 160  Elsewhere in the art world, Descent into Limbo by Andrea Mantegna was the most prominent Old Master artwork to be sold in 2003, going for US$28.6 million[6]: 526  and the government of the Netherlands began returning items from its collection of works it acquired from Nazi Germany, the Nederlands Kunstbezit-collectie.[6]: 526  Economic hardship and geopolitical events prompted a global shift toward affordable popular fashion, including a surge of face masks with fake brand logos that became popular in Hong Kong during the SARS epidemic.[4]: 200
Plans to replace the World Trade Center remained a focus of the architecture world in 2003, with architects David Childs and Daniel Libeskind placed in charge of the project. Other developments in architecture included an inquiry into the ongoing construction of the Scottish Parliament Building when its expected cost increased tenfold,[6]: 527  and concern that Athens would not be ready to host the 2004 Summer Olympics when construction of the Olympic Stadium of Athens slowed.[6]: 528  New buildings that opened in 2003 included the Silodam housing complex in Amsterdam,[4]: 154  the Albertina art museum in Vienna after a previous closure, the Asian Civilisations Museum in Singapore,[6]: 525  and the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles after sixteen years of development.[4]: 153  The Gherkin finished construction in London,[4]: 154  and the Amber Room of Catherine Palace, which existed from 1717 to 1945, finished reconstruction.[6]: 525
Museums and libraries were looted and burned during riots in Baghdad following the invasion of Iraq.[6]: 2 [4]: 212  About 10,000 items were taken from the Iraq Museum, though many were returned by the end of the year, and several items were taken from the Mosul Museum. The Iraq National Library and Archive was burned down, destroying 500,000 books and 12 million Ottoman documents. The lost treasure of Tillya Tepe was found in Saddam Hussein's possession.[6]: 524

The highest-grossing films globally in 2003 were The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, Finding Nemo, and The Matrix Reloaded, while the highest-grossing non-English film was Bayside Shakedown 2 (Japanese), the 39th highest-grossing film of the year.[8] Critically acclaimed films included Finding Nemo,[9][10][11][12] Lost in Translation,[9][11][13] and Master and Commander.[9][10][13]
Music sales in 2003 amounted to about 2.7 billion units, a decline of 6.5% from 2002.

No non-English albums were among the global top fifty albums sold in 2003.[15] The opera industry was negatively affected by a decline in tourism and other economic factors in Europe and North America, and many productions were canceled.[6]: 505
The popularity of the Harry Potter franchise meant that the publication of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was the largest literary event in 2003, bringing significant growth to the publishing and bookseller industries.[6]: 529 [4]: 244–245  The Daily Sun launched and became an immediate success in South Africa as a newspaper targeted toward black audiences as recovery from Apartheid continued.[4]: 243  Former Peruvian president Alberto Fujimori began a radio show, The Chino's Hour, from exile in Japan.[4]: 242  The television programs Queer Eye and Saudi Women Speak Out provided unprecedented media outlets for American gay men and Saudi women, respectively.

When decentralized peer-to-peer file sharing replaced the centralized platform Napster as a means to pirate music, the Recording Industry Association of America began directing legal action against individual users who uploaded pirated songs rather than the platforms themselves, filing a total of 382 lawsuits.[6]: 483  The iTunes Store launched on April 28 and was immediately successful, selling over 10 million songs over the next four months.[7]: 87  This was touted as a possible solution to music piracy.[6]: 483
Sports[edit]
Main article: 2003 in sports

In football, the transfer of footballer David Beckham from Manchester United F.C. to Real Madrid CF for £17.25 million was widely publicized. The UEFA Euro 2004 qualifications took place in 2003, where Turkey's defeat in a game against Latvia came as an upset after Turkey had been semi-finalists in the 2002 FIFA World Cup.[6]: 533  The 2003 FIFA Women's World Cup was held in the United States after being moved from China due to a SARS outbreak; Germany won their first title after they defeated Sweden.[4]: 307  Other major sporting upsets took place in golf when Ben Curtis defeated some of the sport's top players in his first major competition at the 2003 Open Championship,[16][6]: 539  and in Major League Baseball when the Florida Marlins defeated the New York Yankees in the 2003 World Series.[6]: 541

Economy[edit]
The global economy was weak in the first half of 2003 as uncertainty arose from Middle Eastern conflict, the spread of SARS, and major corporate scandals of the previous year.[6]: 9  It improved in the second half of 2003 with recovery from the early 2000s recession, remedied by low interest rates and expansionary fiscal policy. The gross world product increased in total by 2.5% in 2003, and international trade increased by 4.75%. The United States led the recovery, while China and Japan also made significant contributions. The economic situation improved in Latin America and Africa, while Western Europe saw slower recovery.[17] The Eurozone had a low GDP growth of 0.5%.[6]: 12  Questions arose around the Eurozone as the British economy fared better than those which had adopted the euro, and a referendum in Sweden showed strong opposition to the euro's adoption.[4]: 351  Developing countries did especially well with a growth rate of 5%, compared to the 1.8% growth in developed countries.[4]: 173  Argentina emerged from its economic crisis after four years, reaching the year's highest GDP in the Western Hemisphere with 7% growth.[6]: 11
The invasion of Iraq caused markets to fluctuate, first through a significant increase and then a decline as the war's financial cost became apparent and the 2003 Istanbul bombings shocked the economy.[4]: 177  Petroleum prices fell after the invasion of Iraq concluded and rose again following an announcement that OPEC would reduce its output.[4]: 182  The prices of non-fuel commodities, such as metal, minerals, and agricultural materials, increased during the year.[17] Gold, copper, nickel, and aluminum all saw increases in value.[4]: 182  The airline industry began a slow recovery from the serious decline it faced after the September 11 attacks.[4]: 182  Foreign direct investment became a global economic priority when it began to falter, with 70 countries implementing at least one new law in attempts to improve the situation.[4]: 173  In the corporate world, the Italian food company Parmalat and the Dutch supermarket company Ahold were the subjects of major corporate scandals.[6]: 12  These were the latest among a series of corporate corruption scandals over the previous years that led the United States and a coalition of European countries to reform their policies on the matter.[6]: 15
Potential mergers and acquisitions in the media industry were a topic of discussion in 2003. Protestors in the United States objected to loosening of Federal Communications Commission regulations around television station ownership, causing the US Congress and the courts to overrule the changes. American company Liberty Media acquired UnitedGlobalCom and purchased shares in QVC to reach 98% ownership.[4]: 239  HKATV CEO Chan Wing-kee purchased shares in HKATV in Hong Kong so that he had half ownership, while Hong Kong businessman Li Ka-shing purchased 64% of China Entertainment Television.[4]: 240  A merger between TCL Electronics and Thomson created the world's largest television set manufacturer.[4]: 241  The largest purchase of the newspaper industry in 2003 occurred when John Fairfax Holdings of Australia acquired Independent Newspapers of New Zealand, while a merger also took place between Denmark's two largest newspapers, Jyllands-Posten and Politiken.[4]: 243

The city of Bam, Iran was destroyed in 2003 by an earthquake.
The year 2003 tied with 2002 as the second hottest year on record, behind only 1998. The year began during an El Niño period that continued until April. A major heatwave occurred in Europe during the summer, causing approximately 70,000 deaths, 14,000 of which were in France. Severe cold weather affected Asia, North America, and Peru. Low precipitation caused droughts in Australia, the United States, and Zimbabwe, but the previous year's droughts in Asia were alleviated by heavy precipitation in the region.[18] Several reports were published in 2003 forecasting severe negative effects of global warming. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change determined that approximately one million species risked extinction if no preventative measures were implemented, and the World Wide Fund for Nature determined that the fresh water access of 7 billion people would be at risk by 2050 because of global warming and other causes.[6]: 485  Reports also warned about the potential destruction of the Amazon rainforest and provided evidence that widespread destruction of coral was taking place.[6]: 487  Several studies in 2003 indicated that climate change was causing a global increase in droughts as well as changes to the ranges and life cycles of flora and fauna.[4]: 172
Major earthquakes in 2003 included a magnitude 6.8 earthquake in Algeria on May 21 that killed over 2,200 people and a magnitude 6.6 earthquake in Iran on December 26[19] that destroyed approximately 85% of Bam, Iran.[4]: 170  The largest earthquake of the year was a magnitude 8.3 earthquake off the coast of Hokkaido, but it did not cause significant damage.[4]: 170  Major volcano eruptions included Stromboli, Italy; Reventador, Ecuador; Soufrière Hills, Montserrat; Volcán de Fuego, Guatemala; and Anatahan, Mariana Islands.[4]: 171
The 2003 Atlantic hurricane season was above average in activity, including sixteen named storms of which seven were hurricanes. The most severe hurricanes were Hurricane Fabian, Hurricane Isabel, and Hurricane Kate. Tropical Storm Ana was the first recorded North Atlantic tropical storm to occur in April, and 2003 was the first year since 1887 to have two tropical storms occur in December.[20] The 2003 Pacific typhoon season was slightly more intense than average, though the overall number of tropical storms was below average with 23 total storms. The most destructive typhoons were Typhoon Dujuan, which made landfall in Guangdong, China, on September 2, and Typhoon Maemi, which made landfall in South Korea on September 12.[21]

Politics and law[edit]
International politics[edit]
The Treaty of Accession authorized ten countries (yellow) to join the European Union (blue).
A conference held by the World Trade Organization in September resulted in a dispute between nations that cast doubts on whether the agreements of the Doha Development Round were sustainable.[6]: 14  Developing nations alleged that their input was being excluded by Western powers.[4]: 147  The use of farming subsidies, particularly by Europe, Japan, and the United States, was challenged here because of their effect on developing nations. These disputes led developing nations to form their own alliance, the G21 (later the G20 developing nations).[6]: 485  Several free trade areas were proposed or negotiated in 2003, including separate zones for the Andean Community, ASEAN, Central America, the Commonwealth of Independent States, the Southern Cone Common Market, the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation,[6]: 14  and the Western Hemisphere's Free Trade Area of the Americas.[4]: 147  Some of these were conditional on political reform and democratization.[6]: 14  Cambodia and Nepal became the first developing countries to be approved for World Trade Organization membership through a working-party negotiation.[4]: 347
Renewed concern about nuclear weapons began when North Korea announced its withdrawal from the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in January,[4]: 250  and on February 6 it announced the restoration of its nuclear weapons program.

Political discourse around migration expanded in 2003 from a focus on irregular migration and right of asylum to a more general focus on how inflows of migrants affected trade and the workforce. Many countries expressed interest in regional agreements to manage migration and several summits were held in different parts of the world.[4]: 288–289  Other developments in international politics included the seizure of the North Korean Pong Su by Australia in April after the ship smuggled heroin into the country,[4]: 210  the construction of a Russian military base in Kant, Kyrgyzstan, as the Russian Federation's first foreign military base,[4]: 251  and Libya's acceptance of fault in the 1988 downing of Pan Am Flight 103.

Crime and international law[edit]
The American-led invasion of Iraq dominated discourse around international law and sparked debate about when such actions are justified. Military intervention was supported by countries such as Australia, Spain, the United Kingdom, the United States, and much of Eastern Europe, while its strongest opponents included China, France, Germany, and Russia.[6]: 491  Proponents justified the actions by invoking a right to self defense through preemptive war, the allowance of use of force in Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter,[4]: 207  and past United Nations Security Council resolutions.[6]: 491  The United Nations played a critical role in international discourse around the invasion as its relations with the United States were strained.[4]: 346  International relations were similar troubled in Europe where British support for the war brought the UK into diplomatic conflict with much of Western Europe.[4]: 351  The US was criticized for holding suspected terrorists without due process and subjecting them to torture.[4]: 287  The Iraqi president Saddam Hussein went into hiding as the invasion took place, but he was discovered and arrested six months later.[6]: 4  The Iraqi government was replaced by the Coalition Provisional Authority, led by the United States military.[4]: 248
The International Court of Justice (ICJ) accepted two new cases in 2003: a border dispute case between Malaysia and Singapore and a dispute over the United States' application of the death penalty against Mexican nationals. The United Nations General Assembly requested an advisory opinion from the ICJ regarding the construction of the West Bank barrier by Israel. A case filed by Libya against the United Kingdom and the United States regarding the 1988 downing of Pan Am Flight 103 was settled outside of court.[6]: 491  The ICJ ruled in the Oil Platforms case that American force was not justified in the 1987 attacks on Iranian oil platforms but that it had not broken the 1955 treaty as Iran alleged. It rejected appeals of a 1992 border dispute between El Salvador and Honduras and a 1996 decision that the ICJ had jurisdiction in Yugoslavia at the time.[6]: 492
The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia convicted major political leaders, including President of Republika Srpska Biljana Plavšić and military commander Stanislav Galić.[6]: 495  The Tribunal for Rwanda convicted clerics and issued the first international convictions for journalists since the Nuremberg trials.[6]: 494  Terms for the creation of a Khmer Rouge Tribunal in Cambodia were agreed on in June.[6]: 495  The International Criminal Court (ICC) was inaugurated in March with Argentine lawyer Luis Moreno Ocampo as its first chief prosecutor.

Several Christian denominations debated homosexuality and same-sex marriages in 2003. The Catholic Dicastery for the Causes of Saints, the Southern Baptist Convention, and the Coptic Orthodox Church all took stances against it,[4]: 277  while the United Church of Christ endorsed the inclusion of transgender people.[4]: 278  The Anglican Communion was embroiled in debate about its stance on homosexuality when Rowan Williams was made Archbishop of Canterbury on February 27 and expressed concern that the issue was fragmenting the church. Jeffrey John was nominated as Bishop of Reading in May, but his relationship with a man caused controversy and prompted him to decline. A similar debate took place when the gay reverend Gene Robinson was made Bishop of New Hampshire on November 2.[6]: 470 [4]: 277
Opponents of the American-led invasion of Iraq saw it as an attack on Islam.[6]: 471  Organized efforts were made by political and religious leaders in the Muslim world to differentiate typical Islam from extremism. Religious strife occurred in Saudi Arabia where Wahhabi Muslims supported stricter application of Islamic law—some engaging in civil unrest and suicide bombings—while other denominations spoke in favor of tolerance for minority religions and women.[6]: 472  Terrorist attacks took place throughout the Middle East, including a car bombing at the Imam Ali Shrine that killed Mohammad Baqir al-Hakim, the most prominent pro-US cleric in Iraq, and at least 80 other people.[4]: 278  French society and the French government, especially within the National Front, took a hostile approach toward Muslims in 2003. A proposal was made to ban religious attire in schools, while at the same time the country's first Muslim-run school was opened in Lille.[6]: 473
Judaism was marked with disputes between different sects, both in Israel and the United Kingdom. Israel debated whether Haredi Jews should be allowed to retain exemptions to certain laws.[6]: 473  The British Masorti Rabbi Louis Jacobs was not permitted in an Orthodox ceremony for his granddaughter's marriage on the orders of the beth din in London, reigniting the Jacobs Affair of the 1960s.[6]: 474
Hindus were allowed to enter an 11th-century memorial in Bhojshala, Madhya Pradesh, after a five-year ban against Hindus culminated in violence.[4]: 279  Controversy erupted in the Hindu world after the reprint of Ganesa: Lord of Obstacles, Lord of Beginnings by Paul Courtright and the publication of Shivaji: Hindu King in Islamic India by James Laine. Both of these books were seen as offensive by some Hindu groups, causing the writers and publishers to receive threats and harassment.[6]: 474  The Gurdwara Sri Guru Singh Sabha Southall opened in London as the largest Sikh temple outside of India.[4]: 279–280  In Haiti, practitioners of voodoo were given the right to register with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Religion.[4]: 279
Science[edit]
The dinosaur Rajasaurus was described in 2003.The Herto Man was dated to approximately 160,000 years ago and proposed as a human subspecies Homo sapiens idaltu.

Several countries supported international bans on human cloning.[6]: 478  The cloned horse Prometea was the first mammal in which its mother was also its genetic donor, while the cloned sheep Dolly died on February 21 after living for only six years, raising doubts about the viability of cloning.[6]: 479  The use of genetically modified crops was also a controversial issue, particularly in the European Union where a moratorium on genetically modified food remained in effect. Many other countries expanded their production of genetically modified crops.[4]: 147
