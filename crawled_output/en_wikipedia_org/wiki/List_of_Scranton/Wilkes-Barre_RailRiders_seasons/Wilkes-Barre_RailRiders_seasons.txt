From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
The Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders have played at PNC Field, formerly Lackawanna County Stadium, since 1989.[1]
The Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders are a Minor League Baseball team that plays in the Scranton–Wilkes-Barre metropolitan area of Pennsylvania. Founded as members of the Triple-A classification International League (IL) in 1989, the team was known as the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Red Barons during their Major League Baseball (MLB) affiliation with the Philadelphia Phillies from 1989 to 2006. They became known as the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees in 2007 after affiliating with the New York Yankees, rebranding as the RailRiders in 2013 while maintaining their affiliation with New York. In conjunction with the 2021 restructuring of the minor leagues, the RailRiders were placed in the new Triple-A East (AAAE) in 2021,[2] but this league was renamed the International League in 2022.[3]
The team has played 4,999 regular-season games and compiled a win–loss record of 2,665–2,334, resulting in a winning percentage of .533. The RailRiders' best regular-season record occurred in 2016 when they finished 91–53 (.636). Conversely, their worst record was 62–80 (.437), which they recorded in both 1993 and 1994.[4]
The RailRiders have won two International League championships (2008 and 2016) and one Triple-A championship (2016).[5][6][7] They have also claimed thirteen division titles, including five consecutive division championships from 2006 to 2010, as well as three wild card playoff berths. The RailRiders experienced a difficult start, making only one postseason appearance in their first ten seasons—an IL championship series berth in 1992—which was also their only winning season during that span. However, under manager Dave Miley (2007–2015), the team enjoyed a sustained period of success, reaching the postseason four straight times and winning seven division titles. Miley also guided them to two IL championship series, winning in 2008 and finishing as the runner-up in 2009.[8]
