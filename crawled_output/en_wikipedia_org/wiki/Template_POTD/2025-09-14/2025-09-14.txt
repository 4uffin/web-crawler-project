Picture of the day
Sclerophrys gutturalis, also known as the African common toad or the guttural toad, is a species of amphibian in the true toad family, Bufonidae. It is found in Africa in a region stretching from Kenya west to Angola and south to South Africa, and inhabits areas of forest, savanna and wetland. Males grow up to 90 millimetres (3.5 in) and females 120 millimetres (4.7 in) in length. The upper surface is buffish brown with variable irregular dark brown markings, while the underparts are pale and granular and the male has a dark throat. This photograph shows a S. gutturalis toad swimming in Lake Sibaya, South Africa.Photograph credit: Charles J. Sharp
