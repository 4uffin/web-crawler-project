James Michalanney is a former Australian rules footballer who played for the Norwood Football Club in the South Australian National Football League (SANFL).
Known as a tall and strong-marking forward with the nicknames "Big Jim" and "Piano" for his perfect set of white teeth,[1] Michalanney was part of four Norwood premierships. He was forced to miss the whole of the 1980 SANFL season due to a mystery groin complaint which was eventually diagnosed as deep-seated pelvic bone damage. During that time, Michalanney took up croquet at the Norwood Club and won the 1980 South Australian All Grades Doubles Championship, a handicap trophy.[2]
In 1984, he was awarded Life Membership of the Norwood Football Club.[3]
Michalanney worked as a school teacher during his playing days, and later became principal of Murray Bridge High School.[4] He has five children: William, Charlotte, Tom, Max and Jack. His son Max has also become a footballer, selected by the Adelaide Crows with pick 17 of the 2022 AFL Draft.
