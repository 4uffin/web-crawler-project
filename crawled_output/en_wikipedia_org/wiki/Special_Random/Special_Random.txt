Alberto Valdés (1918–1998) was a Mexican-American artist known for his experimental approach, mastery of abstraction, and a profound dedication to the act of painting.[1]
Life[edit]
Early life and education[edit]
Valdés was born in El Paso, Texas, to Lydia Valdés and Alberto R. Valdés Sr., a composer and conductor of the Mexico City Philharmonic Orchestra. His parents had immigrated to the United States to escape the Mexican Revolution. He and his younger brother Armand were raised in the Boyle Heights neighborhood in East Los Angeles, home to a diverse mix of Mexican and Italian families.[2]
Displaying a natural talent for art from an early age,[2] Valdés graduated from Lincoln High School in 1936 and was awarded a scholarship to attend Harper's School of Art in Los Angeles. The award letter praised him, “His work is outstanding.... You should be proud of Mr. Valdés, for we have great faith in his ability.”[2]
In his twenties, he worked as a commercial artist, producing magazine ads, billboard designs, and orange-crate labels.[2]
Military Service[edit]
From 1941 to 1945, Valdés served as a communication chief in the United States Army during World War II in the European theater. He was awarded the Good Conduct Medal, American Campaign Medal and the European African Middle Eastern Campaign Medal.
Post-War Career[edit]
After returning from the war, Valdés was hired as an art designer at MGM Studios, where he worked on movie set designs until his retirement in the early 1960s.[2]
Artistic Practice[edit]
Beginning in the 1960s, Valdés focused exclusively on his personal art. He worked only sporadically to support himself,[3] choosing not to pursue a commercial or public artistic career.[2]
A passionate and self-driven artist, he shifted from oil to acrylic paints to reduce drying time and support his prolific output.[2] Often working in series, he painted multiple works simultaneously, moving freely between styles and genres.[2]
Valdés pursued an independent artistic path outside of the established networks of Californian and Chicano art.[3] He saw no need for external validation[2] and declined to exhibit or sell his work during his lifetime.[1]

Influences[edit]
A self-taught artist, Valdés built an extensive personal library of art books and magazines, feeding his interest in global art movements.[3] Deeply inspired by pre-Columbian and modern Mexican art, he felt a cultural and intellectual kinship with artists such as Rufino Tamayo and Ricardo Martinez.[3] He also admired European masters including Caravaggio, Joan Miró,[2] Pablo Picasso and Paul Klee.[1]
"Mi arte es mi vida"[edit]
Valdés described a spiritual connection to painting and often said, “Mi arte es mi vida” (My art is my life).[1]
He died in his home in Silver Lake, Los Angeles, on May 10, 1998, leaving behind hundreds of paintings and drawings.[2]
