Em3rgent0rdr talk contribs (→Noise reduction:
Add that this SNR was achieved by combining record SNR from both detectors, summarized from the citation's statement that: "GW250114’s record extends to the individual detectors, with SNRs of 53 and 60 at LIGO Hanford and LIGO Livingston, respectively. The combination of the two LIGO detectors at comparable sensitivity enables the measurement precision reported here." Add locations of these detectors so it is evident to reader that they are in different states.) Tag: Visual edit
