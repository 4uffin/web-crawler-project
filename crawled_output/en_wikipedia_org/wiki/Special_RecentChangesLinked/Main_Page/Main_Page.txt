MIDI talk contribs (→14:
we do not get to state this date as fact when the sources don't do so – that's against WP:V. This wording has precedent ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=%22%28body+discovered+on+this+date%29%22&title=Special%3ASearch&profile=advanced&fulltext=1&ns0=1]); all the sources say his body was discovered on that date. I have done a WP:GOOGLECHECK, and all the sources state the date of discovery and don't offer a date of death. We mustn't either.)
