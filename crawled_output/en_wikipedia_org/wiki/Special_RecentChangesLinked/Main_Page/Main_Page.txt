Lethargilistic talk contribs ("They began following...but had their origin in" pointed to two different origins, as if the second was slapped on later. Implies to me that the stuff after "but" probably should be in this sentence, but changed to "and" because I'm not up to speed.)

MIDI talk contribs (→Death:
the source does not say anything like "many players". It says "Phil Foden [...] dedicated Manchester City’s 3-0 derby defeat of Manchester United to [...] Ricky Hatton" and Foden is quoted as saying "One hundred per cent I had extra motivation going into the game. [...] The lads gave everything". That's as close as this comes.)
