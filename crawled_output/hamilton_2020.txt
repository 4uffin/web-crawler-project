Entertainment Weekly
On film, Hamilton feels every bit as fresh, invigorating, intoxicating, and revolutionary as it did when it premiered five years ago.

NOW Toronto
In a single song, Renee Elise Goldsberry shows off a range between Monica's vocals and Lauryn Hill's rhyme skills. Goldsberry drops the most exhilarating performance I've seen all year.

Daily Telegraph (UK)
The dramatic themes here are big and eternal, and the way history played them out gives them a powerful thump.
Rated: 5/5

I have rarely seen a recording of a stage musical capture the scale and electricity of a live performance, but “Hamilton” comes the closest.

All these ideas and issues are conveyed even more powerfully on film than watching it in a theater...

The phenomena that's been the topic of conversation for the past few years is a must watch. Friendly reminder on why Lin Manuel Miranda is a genius.

Hamilton was phenomenal! I am so thankful that I decided to attend this movie. It was an extraordinary experience. Seeing the movie makes me want to see the musical on Broadway. It was great seeing the performance of the original cast.

A great show
with
good
production
values and brilliant performances by the. Entire cast.
As staged on Broadway there were brilliant
theatrical affects that filled the entire stage through state of the art
Broadway stagecraft - lighting, set changes brilliant, innovative, choreography ! Unfortunately many of those stage effects were lost in the transition to a cinematographic film presentation
- constantly, and sometimes rapidly shifting
between shots of the full stage, mid range shots, and close-ups of individuals - and failed to show the full range
of spectacle occurring on the stage.
A disappointment to a Theater lover.
Perhaps more appealing to a film
goer with a more limited appreciation for
live
theatrical performance.
