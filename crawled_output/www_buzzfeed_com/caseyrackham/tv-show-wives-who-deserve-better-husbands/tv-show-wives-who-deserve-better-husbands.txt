We recently asked the BuzzFeed Community, "Which TV Show Wives Are Way Too Good For Their Husbands?" And wow, did people name names! Here's a look at some of the TV wives who probably deserve better TV husbands:
1.
Tami (and Eric Taylor) from Friday Night Lights:
NBC/Courtesy Everett Collection
"Tami Taylor was a wonderful wife and mother who just got shit on by her husband and her daughter. Eric Taylor didn’t care about his wife unless he needed her to do something for the team. When she was promoted from guidance counselor to principal, he constantly fought with her and questioned her decisions for the school. When she was later offered a position as dean OF AN ENTIRE FREAKING COLLEGE, he fought with her because it was in Philadelphia. He just kept saying, 'No, I’m not considering it…that job is in Philadelphia, MYYYY job is here.' Tami put up with all of his shit, from sneaking out of bed in the middle of the night to watch game film, to tolerating all the players knocking on their door in the middle of the night, to the 'we have 100 people coming for a barbecue in two days and you’re telling me now?'"—colleenh49665d105
2.
Rainbow (and Dre Johnson) from Black-ish:
ABC/Courtesy Everett Collection
"He really was a terrible husband. He was a good earner and decent father, I’ll give him that, but he was a man-child in many ways and was not the strong support system that a queen like Rainbow needed."—briantaar"I can’t stand Dre because he can recognize racism, but he denies the existence of sexism. He’s such a dick to Bow. Bow, on the other hand, is an amazing character!"—Hanlee
3.
Debra (and Ray Barone) from Everybody Loves Raymond:
CBS/Courtesy Everett Collection
"Raymond is the definition of weaponized incompetence and offered nothing to that relationship besides a paycheck. On top of that, she had to deal with his insufferable parents living across the street and barging into her house with no notice and no boundaries."—Anonymous, 44, Pennsylvania"Debra needed to dump Raymond for a guy with much better parents or whose parents were not as enmeshed."—troper
4.
Cristina Yang (and Owen Hunt) from Grey's Anatomy:
ABC/Courtesy Everett Collection
"He knew that Christina did not want kids, and yet he still tried to force her to have a baby. And when she scheduled the abortion, he left her. Then there was that weird period during Season 8 when they reconciled, only for him to shout at her that she killed their baby. AND THEN HE FREAKING CHEATS ON HER! WTF OWEN! I lost all respect for him after that."—smokeyandvv
5.
Beth (and Randall Pearson) from This Is Us:
NBC/Courtesy Everett Collection
"He constantly squashed Beth's dreams and didn't support her a lot of the time. Yet Beth was always the one who calmed him down when his anxiety flared up, and she pretty much took care of and counseled the whole family by HERSELF. Beth is a QUEEN and honestly...she deserved better." —lvsmith888
6.
Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler (and Sheldon Cooper) from The Big Bang Theory:
Warner Brothers / CBS/Courtesy Everett Collection
"Sheldon consistently treated her very poorly, the way a narcissist would treat his partner. She would have been a much better match for Raj. Amy started as a brilliant scientist, but devolved into a crying mess."—troper
7.
Lois (and Peter Griffin) from Family Guy:
FOX/Courtesy Everett Collection
"Even the Grim Reaper asks Lois, 'Honestly! What do you see in him?'"—majorh
8.
Marge (and Homer Simpson) from The Simpsons:
FOX/Courtesy Everett Collection
"Homer Simpson, but ONLY from Season 12 onwards. Prior to that, he was a good-hearted and loyal buffoon. Over time, he became an outright selfish and dangerous moron (probably as the show felt the need to keep up with Family Guy). Buying a gun and leaving it lying around the house, getting into a drunken car accident and letting Marge take the blame... the list goes on."—Anonymous
9.
Cheryl (and Jim Orenthal) from According to Jim:
Touchstone Television/Courtesy Everett Collection
"I recently saw a rerun of it, and he lost their truck in a bet at a bar that he got hustled on, and when she got it back, he insisted that she undermined his manliness and took it back to the guy because he was the 'man' of the house. Never mind that this was also the vehicle he used for his business. He frequently mansplained to her, and it was just hard to watch."—Anonymous, 32, Canada
10.
Harriet (and Carl Winslow) from Family Matters:
ABC/Courtesy Everett Collection
"He would talk down to Harriet like she was stupid until he was proven wrong, and I always hated that. He shook his head at her like she was a child and an idiot. Used to burn me up."—annef06
11.
Carrie (and Doug Heffernan) from The King of Queens:
CBS/Courtesy Everett Collection
"Selfish and immature. In the real world, Carrie would have left him a long time ago."—kidhalloween85
12.
Jay (and Michael Kyle) from My Wife and Kids:
ABC/Courtesy Everett Collection
"He was not supportive of Jay going back to school because he wanted her to be a stay-at-home mom, even though those kids were old enough to take care of themselves. He was resistant to going to couples counseling and spending time with his wife that didn't involve sex. He would punish and humiliate her to try to teach her a lesson instead of just talking to her like an adult, like when she wanted to join him golfing to spend time with him, and he ruined her yoga class to show her how annoying it is. He also pushed her to get invasive surgery cause he was too scared to get a vasectomy."—justchillman
13.
Francine (and Stan Smith) from American Dad:
FOX/Courtesy Everett Collection
"She's WAY TOO GOOD for Stan, hands down."—Anonymous, 14, Denver"Seriously, she got locked up in a loony bin just because he forgot their anniversary once. She was framed for one of her friend's murders because Stan didn't want to hear her say, 'I told you so' about Stan's boss and her friend being a good couple option. That's only two examples; I could list more."—Anonymous, 33, USA
14.
Louise (and John McIntyre), Mildred/Lorraine (and Henry Blake), and Louise (and Frank Burns) from M.A.S.H.:
20thCentFox/Courtesy Everett Collection
"Every single one of them not only cheated on their wives, but did it so blatantly and yet still had the audience believing, except Burns, that they were these awesome family men who truly cared about their wives and children.—johnbannon
15.
Edith (and Archie Bunker) from All In the Family:
CBS/Courtesy Everett Collection
"Archie Bunker should be at the absolute top of everyone’s list."—anonymous
16.
Georgette (and Ted Baxter) from The Mary Tyler Moore Show:
CBS/Courtesy Everett Collection
"This is going to give me away as a Boomer!"—lovelyshield875
17.
Kitty (and Red Foreman) from That ’70s Show:
Carsey-Werner Co/Courtesy Everett Collection
—Anonymous, 32, Canada
18.
And finally, the most divisive response: Claire (and Phil Dunphy) from Modern Family:
ABC/Courtesy Everett Collection
"While I generally like the show, Phil and Claire from Modern Family have zero chemistry. He is such a childish goofball and brings very little to the relationship. She has to do all the heavy lifting AND parent his dumbass half the time. It’s hard to like them as a couple. Most of the show, I’m left wondering what she possibly saw in him to have married him."—Anonymous, 48, Minnesota
