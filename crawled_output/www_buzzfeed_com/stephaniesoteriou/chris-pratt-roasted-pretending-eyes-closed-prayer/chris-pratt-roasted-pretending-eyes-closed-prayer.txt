Chris Pratt is being roasted after he posted a video of himself praying to his social media accounts on Sunday — but was seemingly only pretending to close his eyes.

The 46-year-old star encouraged his fans to join him for the prayer in the footage he shared alongside the caption: “Be still…” “Hey guys, just stop real quick and pray with me,” Chris began, before quoting Psalm 46:10: “Be still, and know that I am God.” He then said a prayer to the camera with his eyes closed, and when he finished the prayer, he told fans: “OK, now you can continue scrolling, or you can turn your phone off and go outside.”“Might I suggest the latter?” he continued. “Go get some sunshine. Go look at a tree, touch some grass, call a friend. If you’ve got time to be on your phone right now, you’ve got time to do your to-do list, and you’ve got time to reach out to somebody in need. Share this prayer with them.”
And while Chris’s intentions were undeniably pure, the video ended up sparking ridicule when an X user pointed out that the star’s eyes weren’t actually closed as he prayed, with it being speculated that he was actually reading from a script while trying to pretend that he knew it by heart.

“his eyes not fully closed all the way so he can read the verses is sending me,” the viral tweet — which has been seen more than 6 million times — reads, with hundreds of thousands of other social media users liking, retweeting, and replying.

“bro is squintin hard thinkin we won't notice,” a popular response added, while somebody else asked: “How are you an actor and still can’t memorize prayer lines.”“I’m crying so bad, I thought he was having an allergic reaction at first,” another person wrote.One more pointed out: “like why didnt he just keep his eyes fully open. no one would’ve thought it was weird if he just prayed with his eyes open so he could read the verses.”

The star is known to be a devout Christian, and his religious beliefs have come under fire in the past. In 2018, Chris faced backlash when it was reported that he is a member of Zoe Church in Los Angeles, which is affiliated with the controversial Hillsong Church that has a reputation for being anti-LGBTQ+. Chris confirmed that this is his church in 2022.

While Zoe Church has not officially spoken out against the LGBTQ+ community, it is thought to implicitly hold similar values to Hillsong, as its founder, Chad Veach, previously told the New York Times that he modeled Zoe on Hillsong, where he used to preach. In 2019, actor Elliot Page called Chris out for his church’s assumed anti-LGBTQ+ views on X, which prompted a response from Chris, who insisted on Instagram that his church “opens their doors to absolutely everyone.” As an example of this, Chris detailed being welcomed into the church after his divorce."Despite what the Bible says about divorce, my church community was there for me every step of the way, never judging, just gracefully accompanying me on my walk,” he wrote at the time. “They helped me tremendously, offering love and support. It is what I have seen them do for others on countless occasions regardless of sexual orientation, race or gender."
Unsurprisingly, this comparison rubbed people up the wrong way, with it being argued that being divorced is not equivalent to being a member of the LGBTQ+ community. Chris went on to insist at the time: "I am a man who believes that everyone is entitled to love who they want free from the judgment of their fellow man."

However, the fresh scrutiny prompted some to look into Chris’s past comments about religion, and he faced even more controversy when a 2015 interview about hunting resurfaced. In a conversation with the Guardian, Chris said that killing animals made him feel closer to God. Discussing his love of hunting, he told the publication: “I have a great deal of respect for the animals that I kill, and I feel remorse and all of the emotions that come with it.” “The thing inside me that drives me to go out and hunt is very animal,” he continued. “But the remorse, emotion and respect I feel, and the closeness to God that I feel when I’m out there, is my humanity. It’s an opportunity for me to explore what parts of me are animal and what parts of me are human.”After this resurfaced, Chris appeared to try to distance himself from his faith, and in an interview with Men’s Health, he expressed his confusion over the public’s perception of him.“Religion has been oppressive as fuck for a long time,” Chris said at the time. “I didn’t know that I would kind of become the face of religion when really I’m not a religious person.”
But in 2023, he did another U-turn in a video interview with Page Six, where he likened himself to Jesus Christ as he reflected on the backlash his beliefs have caused over the years.

When asked if he gets criticized, Chris said: “I sure do, but that’s nothing new, that’s nothing new, you know?” He went on to quote the Bible, adding: “If I was of this world, they would love me just like that, but as it is, I’ve chosen out of this world. That’s John 15:18 through 20.”Chris then said: “That’s the way it is, nothing new, 2,000 years ago they hated him, too,” in reference to Jesus.
