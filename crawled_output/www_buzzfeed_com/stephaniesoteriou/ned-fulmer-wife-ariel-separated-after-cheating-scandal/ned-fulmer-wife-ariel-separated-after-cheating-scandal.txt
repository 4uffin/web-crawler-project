On Tuesday, Ned Fulmer was back in the headlines — three years after he left his YouTube comedy group the Try Guys after allegations emerged that’d he’d cheated on his wife, Ariel Fulmer, with a colleague.

As a brief recap, at the time, Ned had widely been known as a “wife guy,” and his infidelity sparked shockwaves. The scrutiny became even more intense when the remaining three Try Guys released a video claiming that it was fans who had “alerted” them to Ned’s behavior.

Ned retreated from the spotlight and, eventually, the scandal blew over. Then, earlier this week, Ned sat down for an interview with People ahead of the launch of his new podcast, Rock Bottom. In the interview, Ned said that after his indiscretion came to light, he spent time “trying to understand" what he had done, as Ariel was the one he “cared the most about.”

“That was most devastating to work through and to realize — how much pain I had caused her," he went on. “It’s pretty well known that I was presenting myself as a wife guy who talked about his adorable relationship. It was something fans seemed to resonate with, and I leaned into it consciously. It certainly was a part of my life.”

“I understand that that’s why it was such a big scandal — because it’s ironic and it feels like a rug pull to people,” Ned added in the interview. “That must have been really painful and devastating to the viewers.”
Notably, in this interview, Ned went on to confirm that he and Ariel were able to move forward as a couple by doing therapy together, and that they established a “foundation of trust” in their marriage.

“It’s certainly stronger than it was before," Ned added while talking about the current state of their relationship. "We have a much clearer sense of boundaries — understanding and respecting each other’s boundaries — as well as integrity and being direct with each other, even when it might be unpleasant.”

But it turns out that Ned skirted over a pretty big fact during this interview, with TMZ revealing just hours later that Ned and Ariel have actually separated after 15 years together.

Sources told the publication that they are no longer together romantically, and will have an honest discussion about their relationship on the first episode of Ned’s podcast, which drops later today.

The news came after TMZ obtained a photo of Ned with another woman in Los Angeles earlier this month.People later confirmed the report, with a spokesperson for Ned telling the publication that he still “cares deeply” for Ariel, and they remain on good terms — even traveling to Greece together over the summer with their two children.
Whew, I wonder what other surprises Ned has up his sleeve — let me know your thoughts on this latest update in the comments below!
