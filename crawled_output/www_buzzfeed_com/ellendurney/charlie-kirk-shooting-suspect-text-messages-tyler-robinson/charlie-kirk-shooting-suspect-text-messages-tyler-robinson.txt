On Tuesday, Sept. 16 ‚Äî the same day that Robinson appeared in front of a judge for the first time since being charged with aggravated murder and six other crimes ‚Äî an unsealed charging document released by Utah County officials disclosed an alleged thread of text messages between the suspected killer and his roommate.

The roommate, who is apparently transgender, has not been named, but is described in the documents as being in a ‚Äúromantic relationship‚Äù with Robinson. Utah Governor Spencer Cox told NBC on Sept. 14 that the roommate ‚Äúhas been very cooperative with authorities,‚Äù with the charging document stating that they provided the alleged messages to investigators. The roommate has not been accused of any wrongdoing.

Robinson ‚Äî who is from a politically conservative family and has been described by neighbors as ‚Äúnormal‚Äù seeming, but ‚Äúreclusive‚Äù ‚Äî apparently lived with his roommate/‚Äúromantic partner‚Äù in an apartment complex in St. George, Utah, about a 10-minute drive away from his family‚Äôs home. Robinson‚Äôs hometown is about a three-and-a-half-hour drive away from where Kirk was fatally shot during a speaking event at Utah Valley University in Orem on Sept. 10.

On the day of Kirk‚Äôs shooting, Robinson allegedly texted his roommate telling them to ‚Äúlook under [his] keyboard.‚Äù There, the roommate located a note that read: ‚ÄúI had the opportunity to take out Charlie Kirk and I'm going to take it.‚Äù Police say they have a photo of the note.
From that point onward, the alleged messages, purportedly sent after the shooting took place, read as follows:
Roommate: What?????????????? You're joking, right????Robinson: I am still ok my love, but am stuck in orem for a little while longer yet. Shouldn't be long until I can come home, but I gotta grab my rifle still. To be honest I had hoped to keep this secret till I died of old age. I am sorry to involve you.Roommate: you weren't the one who did it right????Robinson: I am, I'm sorryRoommate: I thought they caught the person?Robinson: no, they grabbed some crazy old dude, then interrogated someone in similar clothing. I had planned to grab my rifle from my drop point shortly after, but most of that side of town got locked down. Its quiet, almost enough to get out, but theres one vehicle lingering.Roommate: Why?Robinson: Why did I do it?Roommate: YeahRobinson: I had enough of his hatred. Some hate can't be negotiated out.Robinson: If I am able to grab my rifle unseen, I will have left no evidence. Going to attempt to retrieve it again, hopefully they have moved on. I haven't seen anything about them finding it.
...
Roommate: How long have you been planning this?Robinson: a bit over a week I believe. I can get close to it but there is a squad car parked right by it. I think they already swept that spot, but I don't wanna chance it
...
Robinson: I'm wishing I had circled back and grabbed it as soon as I got to my vehicle.... I'm worried what my old man would do if I didn't bring back grandpas rifle ... idek if it had a serial number, but it wouldn't trace to me. I worry about prints I had to leave it in a bush where I changed outfits. didn't have the ability or time to bring it with.... I might have to abandon it and hope they don't find prints. how the fuck will I explain losing it to my old man....Robinson: only thing I left was the rifle wrapped in a towel....Robinson: remember how I was engraving bullets? The fuckin messages are mostly a big meme, if I see "notices bulge uwu" on fox new I might have a stroke alright im gonna have to leave it, that really fucking sucks....¬†Robinson: judging from today I'd say grandpas gun does just fine idk. I think that was a $2k scope;-;
...
Robinson: delete this exchangeRobinson: my dad wants photos of the rifle ... he says grandpa wants to know who has what, the feds released a photo of the rifle, and it is very unique. Hes calling me rn, not answering.
...
Robinson: since trump got into office [my dad] has been pretty diehard maga.Robinson: Im gonna turn myself in willingly, one of my neighbors here is a deputy for the sheriff.Robinson: you are all I worry about loveRoommate: I'm much more worried about youRobinson: don't talk to the media please. don't take any interviews or make any comments. ... if any police ask you questions ask for a lawyer and stay silent
Greg Skordas, a lawyer who is not involved in the case but is working on behalf of the county, told the court on Tuesday that Robinson does not have a lawyer, but that he will be appointed legal representation by the date of his next hearing on Sept. 29. BuzzFeed has made efforts to contact Skordas and Robinson for comment.
