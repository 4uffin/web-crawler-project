Ending a marriage can come with complicated feelings — including grief, confusion, and regret — even if you felt it was the right decision.

So, we recently asked older adults of the BuzzFeed Community who decided to get a divorce years ago and now regret it to share why. They revealed the reasons behind their decision and their biggest lessons, and some of these stories are gut-wrenching. Here are the shocking results:

"I married my high-school sweetheart after we both had experienced bad first marriages. We were true soulmates, married for eight years. We had a nice rural home with property and horses. I had started out as a social drinker, but I let it get the best of me and had an affair. I confessed the affair to my wife, who assured me we could get through it by getting counseling and help for my drinking, which I admitted at the time had become out-of-control, but my guilt was so overwhelming, I insisted on moving out and getting a divorce. That was over 30 years ago, and although I eventually remarried and had children, my heart still aches for her."

"I was 17, and he was 33. A totally dysfunctional relationship, but we married 10 years later anyway. He cheated constantly, mismanaged money, and convinced me I was the one to blame. Forty years later, I'd finally had enough after realizing I was getting older and had no clue if I was financially secure, should anything happen to my health or otherwise. I had no option; I had to file for divorce. He fought me tooth and nail. Four years later, the divorce was finalized, and he moved out of the country. Several months later, he suffered a severe stroke and had to have round-the-clock care. He's now. I visit him whenever I can. I love that man. I always have. And I always will."
"If I had thought for one second it would end up this way, I would have never divorced him. I’ll always think I was the cause of his stroke."—Anonymous, 70, Washington

"Whenever the divorce comes up, my refrain is 'it wasn’t a mutual decision.' It was steeped in anger. All that remains is a dynamic that still takes resources and energy away from both of us, and our kids end up paying the price. A court or mediation process can get two people to agree to anything, but making them follow through is another story. For my part, the focus has been to deepen my relationships with my kids, friends, and even business, but the relationship with my ex and me is an area I still struggle to engage with in a healthy way. And yes, I include 'myself' in that count because when it ended, it ended, and I have struggled daily to forgive my shortcomings and celebrate my progress through it all."
"The entire thing seems selfish and wasteful in hindsight, and I still don't feel done processing the loss, or safe in finally letting go. The defenses at least feel secure, as much as I am tired of them. In the end, all I want is for myself and my kids to be in a place where it's obvious this was the best path, despite the costs of it all."—Anonymous, 47, California

"I was married to my first wife for seven years, but we were together for about seven years before that. I guess I had placed high expectations on marriage to her that were not fulfilled. So, the breakdown of our marriage was not her fault. Being emotionally open as a result of feeling unfulfilled, I ended up cheating on her with a woman who 'totally understood me.' I divorced my wife for this woman, and even left the state to be with her, leaving two beautiful daughters behind.
"(Note: I paid child support, and we had regular visits, so while I left them, I didn't abandon them — not that I'm justifying what I did.) I was in love! We were in love! We got married and had two children of our own. Fast-forward 15 years, and the busyness of our lives and the difficulties of marriage and intimacy (and unfulfilled, unreasonable expectations again) after a period of time started to show in our relationship. My wife says she wants to separate, and I discovered it's because there had been someone else. Trust me, the karma isn't lost on me.Anyway. Do I regret the divorce from my first wife? I don't know. But I regret cheating on her with the person who became my second wife. And not because #2 did to me what I did to #1, but because in all this I learned that if I had put as much effort in my first marriage when it started going bad that I did pursuing something or someone else, to fill a void in my heart that I created myself, then I'd probably still be married to #1. That fills me with lots of regret. And that's a bitter pill to swallow because my mistake gave me two more beautiful children, so how can you really regret that?"—Anonymous, 52, California

"A kindly older gentleman, whom I knew, had divorced his first wife when their daughter was 8. He eventually remarried and had a son. He told me once that if he could do his life over again, he would not have ever had that divorce. He loves his current wife and loves his son, but he said, 'No matter the troubles there were in my first marriage, losing them was not worth the pain and suffering the divorce caused my daughter.'"

"It felt like my family and friends forced me to leave my ex-husband after it was discovered he wiped out our bank account and was seeing his former fiancé again. My parents demanded I get my marriage annulled because of their religious beliefs and set me up to see a divorce attorney ASAP. To this day, I regret not communicating my needs more, such as spending more time at home with me, and of course, not telling him I don't want to divorce and that I wanted to try and work on our marriage."
"It probably would have ended the same, but I regret not expressing my needs and trying to save the marriage."—Anonymous, 36, California

"I'm recently divorced and miss my ex-wife immensely. We had been together for eight years and married for two. I was the one who initiated the divorce, and my reasons for doing so were selfish. It's a pretty long story, but the tldr of it was that I had grown dissatisfied with my life and burned out with my career, and thought that my marriage was the reason for my dissatisfaction. We met in college, hit it off, and eventually got married after a number of years. During this time, I was going through the process of becoming a physician, which is a pretty long, grueling process that includes studying for the MCAT, applying to medical school, going through medical school, then applying for and going through residency. She was with me during this entire period, and helped support me financially, emotionally, and physically, and took care of a disproportionate amount of the housework and other day-to-day things."
"Things were going well for me career-wise, and I had matched into my dream residency program at a prestigious institution, and we were happy and excited to start our new lives together in a new city. We got married before we moved and had a wonderful wedding, which in our eyes was perfect. Unfortunately, our wedding took place right before we were about to move, and in my eyes, we didn't have time for a honeymoon.This is probably where the trouble began. It wasn't just the honeymoon: medical residency is brutal, and the work hours are terrible (on average, I worked 70 hours a week). In my mind, I no longer had time to take her out on regular dates, and our time at home began turning more into time spent separately. Our sex life suffered (my libido became very low, and I frequently felt too tired when she was in the mood). Even climbing, our hobby that we used to always do together, became something that we started doing separately.I became more withdrawn, cynical, and jaded, and blamed the marriage for my unhappiness. I started thinking about what things would be like if I were with someone else, and all of this took a toll on our marriage. I gave almost no effort despite our efforts to try to repair things, and eventually asked for a divorce. There was little drama, and everything was essentially amicable. Initially, I thought that I had made the right decision. Soon, however, the weight of my decision started sinking in. Dating has been a frustrating experience, with many lukewarm encounters, ghosting, and other things that seem to be all too common with modern dating. I realized that the things I was looking for were things that I had with my ex-wife, and that, for a long time, I had taken her support and nearly unconditional love for granted. Unfortunately, I had damaged our relationship beyond repair in her eyes, and she had moved on, enjoying her new freedom in being single and her new ability to independently pursue any career she wanted. I'm truly glad that she's happy and wish her nothing but the best. At the same time, I regret my decision more than anything else I have ever done. She was part of me. She was my everything; I was too selfish and weak to realize it. I would give up my career and anything else to be with her again and have my happiness back. Maybe one day I'll find someone who made me as happy as she did. Maybe not. What I do know is that I was foolish and selfish, and that throwing my marriage away is a decision that will probably haunt me for a long time."—dthrowaway89

"My ex-husband cheated on me with my best friend from kindergarten. He apologized so many times, sending emails, even texting and calling my parents, begging for forgiveness. At the time of our divorce, we had one kid together, age 11. She was a bright light, and our divorce led her to go into deep depression with daily therapy trips. I remember it like it was yesterday when we divorced; it was the beginning of her sixth-grade year. My daughter and I moved 20 minutes away from my ex-husband. I never wanted to see that man ever again, but my daughter has always been close to her father. It was hard to adjust to not living together."
"She would see her dad, but only on holidays. It was a struggle for me to see him and my former best friend living together in a new home, but I do what I have to for my child. I regret divorcing him because I truly still care and love him, even though he's now engaged to my former best friend and expecting a child soon."—Anonymous, 34, Rhode Island

"I initiated the divorce because I was unhappy. He was growing into a person I no longer recognised, and so was I. We fought regularly; I was spending more and more time away from home and feeling better for it. It's been 18 months since I left, and I miss him every day."
"I don't know if I actually regret it, but I wish I'd tried harder. He is about even with good and bad points, but I decided I no longer wanted to spend half my time unhappy, and more than anything, I wanted him to be happy more often, too."—msmthrowaway101

"I was married to my forever, my person, for 10 years. Then, I found he had a double life of porn addiction, voyeurism, subscriptions to almost 20 dating sites, and a plethora of sex toys he only used on himself. I called him out on it, and he started sleeping with other people, ruined my finances, my small business, and my credit. I lost my home, my health, god, you name it.
"Two years later, I still love him and miss our family. I feel empty. I can't for the life of me figure out why I can't let go, even after the divorce."—Anonymous, 47, Texas

"We were married for 32 years and together 40 years. High school sweethearts before divorcing. I regret that he didn't try harder and understand the consequences of divorce. Instead of trying to make me happy with our life, he chose to do things for his new partner that he never did for me. I can't say it doesn't hurt to see how he treats her so special and how he didn't give me the same treatment."

"I feel like in the almost five years that I've been divorced, I've gone back and forth with the thought. I miss the lifestyle I had, and I also miss the security I felt having a husband. I know it was the best decision, but being 39, childless, and single is a terrible feeling."

"I have had two of my friends regret their divorces. One of them got married fairly young (early 20s). She admitted that she was too immature to have realistic expectations of what marriage was really like. She told me that they both had low-paying jobs, but she wanted all the shiny new things right away that more established couples took years to earn. They were like little kids trying to play grown-up. They basically lacked the emotional maturity to deal with adult problems and relationships."
"She wanted the fantasy, so she left the reality behind. Now, she regrets her divorce when she sees her ex with his new wife and kids. She said he was never a bad guy and wished she had tried to work it out."—pookanator

"I regret not showing up better in the last year of our relationship. Life was totally falling apart, and I allowed it to destroy me as a man. Had I had more courage, I doubt I'd be in the situation I am now, but there's something that comes out of that. It taught me that while I truly did and believe that my ex loved me, she would only do so if things were always good in our lives. Her 'needs weren't being met,' so she started having an affair while our entire lives were burning down around us. Sex was the absolute last thing on my priority list. Clearly a mistake on my part, and I take full responsibility for allowing myself to implode."
"She's now in a full-on relationship with her AP, who was also getting divorced, and projecting the perfect life all over social media. We're five months into the separation."—ABCyourwayouttahere

"Sometimes I regret it, but I think we outgrew each other. I miss him some days, but I only wish for him to be happy, even if I'm not with him. We've been in no contact for two years now."

"I divorced my wife after learning she was having an affair and was in love with her affair partner. I loved her to death. I mean, I was crazy about her. Together for 20 years, and my love hadn't decreased a bit. But she never apologized for the affair, and that was my wake-up call that her love for me had faded drastically. She didn't want a divorce; we had children. We went to counseling, and I learned that she had cheated sexually with other men. So, I divorced the love of my life. I regret it, but what could I do?"
"I had to leave to maintain my own self-respect. The divorce hurt the kids, and I will live with that regret, too. And the fact that she could be so cold after all we had been together over the years came as a bitter shock."—Anonymous, 70, Florida
