1. Palmer's Cocoa Butter Tahitian Vanilla Lotion, which is so deeply hydrating that it's designed to be moisturizing for 48 hours — and so delicious-smelling and luxurious that reviewers say it's even better than the TikTok-famous, wildly beloved Eos Vanilla Cashmere Lotion (not to mention cheaper)!

Smells divine without being too strong." —patricia bentham"I’m obsessed with this lotion! It smells amazing, and the scent lingers beautifully on my skin all night. By the 24-hour mark, it’s faint but still there, and the hydration lasts the entire time. I’ve seen a lot of people compare it to EOS vanilla cashmere, but I personally love this one more because it’s much more moisturizing. Even though the fragrance isn’t as strong, I love the soft hint of vanilla and cocoa butter it leaves behind. It pairs perfectly with my gourmand perfumes and body sprays. Definitely my new go-to!" —KxyxlliGet it from Amazon for $6.99.
2. A teensy 2-in-1 nausea relief inhaler that can help with spontaneous nausea, motion sickness, morning sickness, and general queasiness (having a human body is hard).

The foam went down the drain and up through the overflow, bringing lots of black, yucky gunk with it. I have used lots of drain cleaners before, but not one that actually came up through the overflow. I'd never even considered what stuff was in there.

I'm skeptical, but I’m a sucker for this kinda stuff, but it is genuinely amazing. I tested it on all the different areas of my body. It didn’t do a thing to my well-exfoliated palm, but my face, legs, LIPS… baby soft with big balls of dead skin coming off. Like one of those Korean exfoliating gloves, but you don’t have to scrub like you do with those. You just gently rub it in, and your dead skin peels away. I even had a weird callus on my arm that kept regrowing, and it smoothed it down so cleanly. This stuff is truly magic. Just WOW." —NellieGet it from Amazon for $25.
