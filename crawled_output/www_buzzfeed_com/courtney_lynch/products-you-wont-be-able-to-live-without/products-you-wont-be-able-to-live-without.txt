1. A surprisingly effective instant foot-peeling spray when you desire baby-soft footsies but don't have the time OR patience to visit the salon for a pricey pedicure. Just spray onto clean, dry feet and rub away dead skin! For an ~extra~ peeling effect, use an exfoliating mitt.www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comPromising review: "This product delivers exactly as promised and is incredibly easy to use. I suffer from dry skin and often apply various products to soften my feet. With this, I simply spray it on and immediately massage it in with my hands. The dead skin comes off effortlessly. There's no waiting time, and it's gentle on the skin. It leaves my feet feeling exceptionally soft. This has quickly become my new favorite thing." —KimTGet it from Amazon for $5.48 (also available as a two-pack).
2. An instant stain and mildew remover that'll banish pesky mold from outdoor surfaces so well, it'll seem too good to be true. Spray, wait 15 seconds, and watch the mess disappear! Bonus: It can also tackle messes in the bathroom and kitchen so you'll never run out of ways to put it to use.www.amazon.comRMR Brands is a small business specializing in professional-grade cleaning solutions for your home.Promising review: "I cannot believe how well this worked. I am a CLEAN FREAK, and my nasty bathtub would literally keep me up at night. I tried every product on the shelf and nothing worked. I literally scrubbed until my fingers were raw and still got nowhere. I sprayed this bad boy TWICE on the mildew stains and now they are COMPLETELY GONE!! I am so happy, relieved, and thankful, but also mad that I didn’t know about this product sooner. I absolutely, 100% recommend, and I would give it 10 stars if I could!" —Mackenzie MayockGet it from Amazon for $15.99 (available in three sizes and in multipacks).
3. Eos Cashmere Body Oil — it basically smells like soft musk wrapped in a heavy dose of whipped vanilla and cozy caramel. It'll leave your skin feeling soft and supple while locking in velvety moisture that lasts all day long! If you're already obsessed with the lotion version, this will be next on your "must-have" list after trying it once.AmazonPromising review: "I am obsessed with this! From the first pump, you can tell this isn’t your average body oil. It has a silky, lightweight texture that absorbs beautifully into the skin without leaving that greasy, sticky feeling some oils do. My skin instantly feels soft, smooth, and nourished. The scent is luxurious and comforting — soft, slightly sweet, and just the right amount of fragrance that lingers without being overpowering. It truly lives up to the 'cashmere' name — my skin feels pampered and velvety all day long. I especially love using it right after a shower; it locks in moisture and gives my skin a subtle glow. It’s also perfect for layering under lotion for that extra hydration boost during dry seasons." —The Curious VineGet it from Amazon for $12.98 (also available as a shave oil!).
4. Carborundum sponges, aka the kind of amazing cleaning product you'll use until the end of time. They're just *that* good at lifting the stubborn stains and grime you typically spend way too long hunched over the sink angrily scrubbing.www.amazon.comPromising review: "Nice and thin. You'll find so many more uses for these around the house than just getting stuff off the underside of cookware! I had hard, scaly water deposits on the glass surrounding our powder room faucet (one of those fancy, highfalutin modern-looking things). I've tried everything for four years to get this stuff off. One day, I thought, maybe I'll try my sponges. Took it all off super easily!!!! The faucet looks like new. My only rec is to spot-test your item first before using it because it will scratch certain surfaces if you scrub too aggressively (for example, it gets the burned-on, weird stuff off of the bottom of my fave Our Place pan, but I rubbed too hard in one spot and it took the color right off lol)." —HoarderGet an eight-pack from Amazon for $8.29+ (available in two sponge thicknesses).
5. Mielle's (TikTok-famous) Rosemary Mint strengthening oil, which is a biotin-infused formula to help strengthen hair, smooth split ends, and hydrate dry scalps. It promotes growth at the root and is perf for 3A–4C hair types. Reviewers swear by it for eyebrows, too!www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comAccording to the Cleveland Clinic, some researchers have found rosemary oil to be as effective at encouraging hair growth as Rogaine! And read more about how biotin could help with the fullness of hair at Cleveland Clinic. Promising reviews: "Legit magic in a bottle. Wish I could order this stuff by the gallon. Took a chance on this because I was desperate, having already spent so much money on luxury and drugstore products with little results. I use this as a pre-treatment on scalp and ends before I wash hair. Scalp has improved dramatically. I feel like there’s not as much breakage/fallout, and my ends are fuller. (This is after like six months, but my scalp was better immediately.)" —Claire BlanchardI hardly write reviews but this one deserves to be written about!! My hair was falling out a LOT, and somehow just with the FIRST application onwards, I started seeing less fall. And now, after four months, I can see hair growth as well, and my hair is already looking thicker!! And I’ve been using it only once a week, just a few drops and massaging in. Omg, how can anything be so simple and yet so effective!!! Amazing! Amazing!!! Whoever invented this...hats off!!" —Dee Get it from Amazon for $9.96 (available in two styles)
6. Affresh washing machine tablets so you can get rid of the lingering odors and residue that always seem to cling to your clothes. Your machine will literally look brand-new and you hardly had to lift a finger. Yeah, these are gonna become a "subscribe and save" staple.www.amazon.comPromising reviews: "I didn’t think I would ever be so excited about such a thing as washing machine cleaning tablets. I also never realized how dirty my washing machine was. It now sparkles, doesn’t smell musty, and has removed so much gunk from around the drum/gasket. You should get these." —AVDW"I am somewhat of a clean freak and this is a game-changer. I normally wash my washing machine with bleach but this is 10X easier. I recommend using once a month for optimum freshness." —KaylanGet six tablets from Amazon for $11.98.
7. And a dryer vent cleaning system designed to suck out all the lint and dust currently trapped in your dryer vent — it can remove buildup that's up to 12 feet long! It may produce gag-worthy results, but I promise the sheer relief will be worth it. This thin Plus, clogged vents = longer drying times + higher utility bills, so this saves you money too!www.amazon.comPromising review: "This thing worked AMAZING. I got a TON of lint out of my vent piping, my dryer works better now and runs cooler, and drying time has been reduced. I was amazed at how much lint build-up there was!" —Allen L GroomsGet it from Amazon for $29.99 (available in several sizes/styles).
8. A lightweight gel cream from Nivea enriched with Q10, which can help improve your skin's firmness over time with regular use — in as little as two weeks, to be exact! This fast-absorbing formula will for leaving your skin feeling softer and more moisturized with each use. Many reviewers confirm they saw results in a few weeks. Add to cart!!!www.amazon.comThe brand recommends applying twice a day for best results!Read more about how Q10 benefits the skin from the National Library of Medicine.Promising review: "I’ve been using this for a few years and love it! I had loose skin after losing weight, and this gel has been a game-changer, with noticeable improvement in my skin’s texture and firmness in just a few weeks. I use this gel on my thighs, stomach, and underarms. I pair it with Nivea’s body lotion for the rest of my body. A little bit goes a long way, so the bottle lasts a while. I switched over to another gel for a month a bit ago, and I noticed my skin returning to uneven firmness and texture. Once I went back to using this product, I noticed improvements within a few weeks again. So, this isn’t a cure, but with continuous use, results are maintained to keep my skin firm, moisturized, and even textured." —MorganGet it from Amazon for $13.98.
9. A reusable screen-cleaning brush that might make you question how you ever cleaned the screens BEFORE this genius gadget came along. Now you can get rid of caked-on grime and bugs instead of letting it get so bad that you buy all new screens in a moment of sheer desperation. The results will have you singing, "A whoooole new world" as you look out your clean screens.www.amazon.comIt can be used as a handheld brush or you can use the detachable, long-reach handle that extends to 9 inches. The double-sided brush can be used wet or dry and is reusable! Just rinse it clean and hang dry between uses.Promising review: "Our screens are on a second-floor balcony. There really isn't any good way to clean the outside of the screens. Luckily, the fibers on this screen cleaner are small enough that they seem to fit through the screen and clean both sides. I'm sure it doesn't clean the outside as well as it does the inside, but any help is always appreciated. I was actually shocked at how much dirt came off of the screens with this very simple tool. I used it wet with a small amount of dish soap, and it worked really well. I also appreciated that after I was finished, I was just easily able to rinse and dry the screen cleaner for future use. A simple tool at an excellent price." —BonjourBeautyByAmyGet it from Amazon for $16.14.
10. Laneige's Neo Blurring Powder when you wanna *instantly* matte-ify your skin while helping it maintain its natural glow with blue hyaluronic acid. It even comes in a mess-free, travel-friendly case so you can take it on the go! I HIGHLY recommend snagging this before it sells out.Amazon, www.amazon.comCheck out a TikTok of the Laneige Neo Blurring Powder in action. Promising review: "I loved this setting powder, it blurred my pores and blended my makeup so well that even my husband noticed. Wow! I will be buying more before people find it and sell it all out, hehehe." —Charlotte Laim Get it from Amazon for $25.
11. A Capri Blue Volcano-scented multipurpose cleaner you'll be shocked you didn't know about earlier, because YES, it's that signature aroma by Anthropologie you know and love. Cleaning your home will smell so much better, and everyone will be asking you for your secret. Amazon, www.amazon.comPromising review: "This stuff smells SO good! Like a sweet, sugary citrus, but not overpowering so, just a light fresh scent. The smell lasts forever. I used a kitchen towel to wipe my counters down and then hung the towel up and the next day, I could still smell it when I walked into the kitchen. For the scent alone, I would purchase this again! As for cleaning ... it is not a disinfectant, it is just a general multipurpose cleaner, so I wouldn't use it to clean toilets or anything like that. It does a WONDERFUL job at cleaning and cutting through grime and grease. It actually surprised me! It doesn't leave residue or streaks but does leave a clean shiny surface. The bottle is plenty big. The only con is that the spray mechanism doesn't work the greatest. Sometimes it sticks. I use glass spray bottles so I just put it in one of those to solve that issue. Overall, definitely recommend!" —Joshua HornishGet it from Amazon for $15.
12. Clinique Almost Lipstick Tinted Lip Balm in Pink Honey — it's just as good as its internet-famous counterpart, the OG Black Honey. This one *also* belongs in your cart because it gives you a lightweight, buildable tint that complements every skin tone. Apply a single layer for a subtle look or pack a few on if you want a really rosy pout!AmazonPromising review: "This lip color is a fantastic, no-fuss lip product for those who want a natural, effortless look. It offers the best of both worlds— hydrating balm and a hint of color — making it ideal for daily wear. It’s perfect for those looking for a low-maintenance, lightweight lip option with a natural finish. While it may not be the longest-lasting product, its comfort and versatility make it a great addition to any beauty routine." —Nest & NickelGet it from Amazon for $25 (also available in the OG Black Honey!).
13. A jar of the The Pink Stuff because sometimes you need a miraculous cleaning paste to get rid of tough messes. You'll be shocked by how quickly and easily it can lift the stains you've been battling for ages — everything from oven messes to shoe scuff marks to hard water stains in the shower. www.amazon.comPromising reviews: "I am speechless. I had burned on crud on the glass door inside of my oven. I literally took the product and put it on with a sponge, let it sit for 30 seconds, wiped it off with a hot watered paper towel, and it wiped clean! I regret not taking before and after pictures. I have tried everything under the sun and regret not trying this sooner. I was skeptical because I saw it on TikTok. BUY IT!!!!!! Can’t wait to try it on the shower! [Best] stuff I’ve ever used!" —Courtney"This is one of those 'changed my life' products that you come across every once in a while. I have tried so many different things to clean my clear glass shower door and just end up wasting time, money, and effort. The reviews and price of this product sold me on it. I love the smell (very subtle) and I used it with a basic sponge on my shower door. It did take a little effort but not bad and yielded amazing results. I then got excited about the other possibilities and have used it on the inside of my oven door with similar results. It’s great. You won’t be disappointed." —Amazon CustomerGet it from Amazon for $5.43 (also available as a two-pack and in a set with a scrubber sponge).
14. A pore-clearing cleansing oil that will deliver results you can *actually* see. This stuff removes all traces of makeup and sucks sebum from your pores so that your skin is visibly clearer and smoother — so much so that you'll always have an extra bottle on hand.www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comBTW, a lot of reviewers say they use this as part of their double cleansing routine. As the name implies, double cleansing is a method of cleansing your face twice: first with an oil-based cleanser, and again with a water-based cleanser to help get all the yucky stuff out of your pores.Promising reviews: "BEST OIL CLEANSER I SWEAR. I’ve gone through 3–4 bottles now and it continues to cleanse my skin AMAZING. It melts makeup, clears pores. Honestly a heaven-send. The first time I used it, it cleared a lot of my sebum and even now when I use it, it clears any dead skin and dirt I have, even when I don’t wear makeup. BUY IT, it's amazing." —rexichor"Got it because it was all over my TikTok and I wanted to try the double cleansing. And wow, I don't regret it, it's amazing!!!! Leaves my skin so soft and so hydrated. I use it before my water base cleanser and it has helped me reduce my breakouts. I love the texture, the smell is very subtle (you can barely smell it) and I just love it." —Linette GonzálezGet it from Amazon for $17.69.

They are simple to use, cheap to refill, and catch a ton of small bugs and flies. I have eight of them now, all around my house! It’s a little gross how many tiny flying insects are around…but it makes me feel a lot better now that I have these!" —Chris H. Get a two-pack from Amazon for $14.97 (also available in a larger multipack).

This hyped-up tinted concealer contains hyaluronic acid and shea butter that may also help reduce dark circles over time.www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comPromising review: "Took years off my eyes! This product is so reasonably priced. I came across a TikTok promoting this and decided to take a chance since the price was super reasonable. My eyes looked brighter in a good way, and the concealer worked so well that I felt I looked younger. I got compliments from friends asking what I did differently with my makeup. I recommend it." —PlaceholderGet it from Amazon for $6 (available in four shades).
17. Plus, Good Molecules Yerba Mate Wake Up Eye Gel, better known as eyeball fuel so you can keep those lovely "you look tired" comments at bay.

Honestly, I love all the Good Molecules products." —Hayden Smith Get it from Amazon for $5.97.
18. A versatile slicker brush because let's face it, your faux fur rugs, blankets, and jackets have seen better days. Rather than doing the unthinkable and buying new ones, give this a try! This super ~slick~ tool can zhuzh up wool, sheepskin, cashmere, faux fur, etc. so it looks new again.www.amazon.comPromising review: "Where have these been all my life? We purchased a couple of beautiful charcoal-gray (dyed) sheepskin rugs for both sides of our bed. It used to feel really nice to get out of bed and set your feet on them. But after many years and a couple of dogs, my reaction to putting my feet down is, 'Ew. What the heck did I just step on?' Because of the dye, we can't just wash them or get them too wet. And I'm kind of lazy and forgetful. (Meaning, I've been thinking of taking them to a dry cleaner for years — but how much will that cost?) After our puppy had an accident (the worst kind of accident) on one, I knew I had to do something. These rugs weren't cheap, so tossing them wasn't an option. I cleaned up the 'accident' as best I could, but that left the spot feeling kind of dry and crunchy. So, after reading and googling, I decided to try one of these wire wool brushes. HALLELUJAH! It took some muscle to thoroughly brush each rug, but wow, not only did it re-fluff and revive the wool, but it also pulled up a lot of loose dirt and anything that was stuck to the fibers. I really wish I had gotten this brush sooner!" —ReneeGet it from Amazon for $17.99.
19. A curved SPF 50 Airy Sunstick Smoothing Bar, aka a K-beauty product that'll make you *excited* about the SPF step in your daily routine while preventing tragic sunburn.

I've been looking for a stick sunscreen and this was just exactly what was needed!! I'm a medium-toned Black [person] and looking for something without a white cast is always a challenge. I have applied it on my bare skin and there isn't a white cast at all! It's a 'soft matte' finish, for sure, and looks like natural skin. Like you're not wearing anything at all." —MartinaGet it from Amazon for $17.02+ (also available as a two-pack).
20. Dermora's exfoliant foot peel if you're ready to treat your feet to the gift of super smooth skin — no more rough calluses making you wildly uncomfortable.

After more than 30 years of being in sports and the military, these are phenomenal! My feet were so soft and looked perfect! PS — best to use when you don’t need to wear sandals or show your feet because it takes a couple of days for everything to shed off." —RLeighGet a pack of two from Amazon for $19.99 (available in six scents).

This is right up there with my stand mixer. I save hours a week using this for dinner prep. I HATE cutting up veggies for dinner and this makes it fast and fun! I can’t believe I didn’t buy one years ago. This is worth every penny. Easy to use and I can just throw it in my dishwasher for clean up. I’m obsessed. I will be buying these as gifts. This is an absolute must-have for everyone." —ReviewerGet it from Amazon for $26.99+ (available in five colors and four sizes).
22. Lilac St. Original Lashes when you wanna bedazzle people with your mile-high lashes. These vegan, cruelty-free beauties can last for up to 10 days too!

Seriously will never stray." —KatiewGet the starter kit from Amazon for $38 (includes two sets of Original lashes, lash glue, and an applicator).
23. Or E.l.f's Lash Xtndr Tubing Mascara because your lashes deserve the very best and you don't wanna waste your time with dry, clumpy formulas. This one is perfect for thin, delicate lashes. The lightweight tubing technology wraps around your eyelashes for a smudge-proof lift that looks natural. Plus, it's easy to take off at the end of the day without tons of harsh scrubbing.www.amazon.comCheck out a TikTok of the E.l.f. tubing mascara in action. BuzzFeed Shopping writer Emma Lord is a fan: "I am not a new human to the tubing mascara game, and in fact readily spent $26 on the famous OG blend from Blinc every time it needed replacing. I didn't even love it for the length half as much as the fact that tubing mascara like this genuinely never smudges, but can I just say — regardless of price, the E.l.f. tubing mascara formula blows all the others I've tried out of the water. It gives me way more length and volume than other brands, slides on so much more easily, stays put ALL day, and never, ever smudges. My favorite part, though, is how gently and easily it comes off with soap and water. In the past, other mascara removals have felt rough on my lashes, but this comes off so fast that I'm like ??? was I even wearing mascara a minute ago?? Anyway, I hesitate even writing this review because I want to gatekeep the hell out of this before it sells out, but the world needed to know. I'm a big fan of the brown shade (which is what I'm wearing above!), but it also comes in black and soft black."Get it from Amazon for $7 (available in three shades).
24. Mouthwatchers' flossing toothbrush to help remove those annoying food particles stuck between your teeth.

I've always been prone to plaque build up and it's been very hard to get my teeth feeling fresh-out-of-the-dentist clean, but this toothbrush has done the trick! The first time I used it my mouth actually hurt a little like when you get a full cleaning done. It was kind of incredible. The bristles are super soft and not irritating but somehow, magically, deep clean my teeth better than any toothbrush I've had before."Promising review: "It’s so much easier to get around all sides of the very back teeth than with the bulky electric. I love the way it makes my teeth feel afterward. It really does feel like you’ve just left your dentist." —Vicki PerkinsGet a two-pack from Amazon for $9.99 (also available as a four-pack and as a travel toothbrush).
25. A neck and shoulder relaxer because there's something about making a very grownup, responsible purchase that just feels good — and this one actually benefits your physical health!

Just lie down and this ~relaxer~ will do the rest, helping to reduce that stiff neck and shoulder tension in as little as 10 minutes!www.amazon.com, AmazonIf you have any neck or back issues, talk to your doctor before use and read more about cervical traction at Cleveland Clinic.For this, instead of like a regular pillow, you're supposed to lay on it in 10-minute intervals; the seller suggests working your way up to it by starting yourself off at five minutes at a time, with a one- to three-day adjustment period before regular use. Promising review: "This neck relaxer is so easy to use! It took a few times to get used to, but it is not uncomfortable and is very much helpful with my chronic neck pain and shoulder tension.

So thankful for this amazing find as I am only 41 and have been struggling with neck pain for several years now." —Mary BethGet it from Amazon for $18.99 (available in five colors).
26. A 5-in-1 Edgelift Curl Brush that'll give your haircare game a major upgrade. It can help define waves, curls, and coils while preventing pesky frizz! It can also help you create the *perfect* part and section off hair when styling. Many reviewers have even crowned it the Best Brush Ever. 👑Amazon, www.amazon.comIt's designed for every hair type longer than 3 inches. Reviewers with 2b, 3c, and 4a hair types mention that it worked for them!Bounce Curl is a small business that specializes in curl brushes. My colleague Heather Braga uses this brush: "I've bought this brush after seeing it used on Love Island USA and have been testing it ever since. It's super simple to use and I can see how easily the edges separate out my wavy hair. I'm still playing around with which product will hold the waves/curls best, but the brush itself leaves me with fantastic waves just from using it on my wet hair!"Promising review: "Best brush hands down, I am a mixed girl with thick curly hair, and when I run this brush through my hair wet, it does magic. My curls are amazing after using this in the shower to detangle, then I use my choice of product to style it row by row, and it gives me bouncy curls that help cover more scalp but separate effectively. It's extremely sturdy. I break brushes all the time, and this one lasts!!!" —Janay K Get it from Amazon for $29.99 (available in four colors).
27. A long-handled standing weeder because bending over (and over...and over...) to pull pesky weeds should be illegal. Not only will you save yourself time *and* lots of pain, but the yard will look absolutely stunning when you're done.AmazonIt's made with a bamboo handle and powder-coated steel and uses a simple lever system to make weeding easy.Grampa's Gardenware Co. is a small, family-owned business based in Oregon that makes gardening tools.Promising review: "Oh my god, I friggin' love this tool. I bought this on a whim given we bought our first house and know nothing about caring for a yard. Boy has it come in handy. Our new house had a ton of weeds in the front yard and this tool helped me get most of them out in no time. In fact, the process of yanking out the weeds was strangely satisfying! I don't think anyone can say that weeding is fun but this tool made it as close to fun as you can get, especially when you see a long root along with the weed you pulled." —JGGet it from Amazon for $39.97.
28. And a crack weeder tool so you can dominate those ever-resilient weeds that manage to grow through the cracks in concrete no matter what you do! This sturdy tool can get DEEP into those tight spaces and get rid of weeds, moss, and thistles with ease.Sally Elshorafa / BuzzFeedGarden Guru is a small business that sells lawn and garden tools. My colleague Sally Elshorafa invested in this tool and LOVES it: "After moving to the East Coast, I quickly learned that the stone pathways around my home are basically a spa retreat for moss and weeds. The cracks collect moisture, trap organic debris, and offer *just* enough shelter to help unwanted greenery flourish, especially with all the shade and rain we get. I didn't want my outdoor space to turn into a jungle, so I grabbed this tool and got to work. It's weirdly satisfying — kind of like flossing, but for your stone paths. The bent tip slides right into the cracks and pulls weeds out from the root, which helps keep them from coming back anytime soon.

It's quickly becoming one of my favorites. If you've got hardscaping, you need this in your toolkit."Get it from Amazon for $19.95.
