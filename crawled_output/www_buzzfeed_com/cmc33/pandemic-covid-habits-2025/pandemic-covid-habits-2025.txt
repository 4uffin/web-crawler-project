During the pandemic, many of us started new hobbies to pass the time and stay sane — and some of them stuck. From taking daily walks to baking new masterpieces, these pandemic pastimes have turned into lasting parts of our lives.

"Running. Peak pandemic, I was 60-plus lbs heavier than I am now, and I was drinking pretty significantly multiple times a week. One day, I just decided I was sick of being stuck inside and went on a 'run' which was more of a slow jog, a hundred yards or so, then walk, for about a mile total, but it was a start. Now two marathons and literally thousands of miles later, that afternoon was the start of really turning around my personal physical health."
