"I figured out that I can use my thumb on my wife's clitoris in any missionary-like position (using gentle circles and a little pressure). It made a huge difference in us both reaching the finish line, and I usually get the silver medal for it (in a good way). Now that we're older and my hand cramps a lot, we use toys to stimulate her. Now I have a hand free for breast-related activities, which we discovered is also a turn-on for her."

"Teasing and pacing when I go down on my partner. The clitoris isn't actual food, so don't actually eat it. Slow kisses and passes with gentle pressure, kissing and nibbling the inner thighs. It was definitely a more sensual video, but the idea of not racing her across the finish line has changed my oral game."

"We got a wand vibrator and then a clitoris sucker. They're great for when I'm tired from work or just not really in the mood to perform well. Using either in any position also sends her to outer space, so money well spent."

"Masks and blindfolds can be hot. Removing the sight part of it can take away some inhibitions and create some mystery for the person who is blindfolded."

"Having a large, strong man lift you up and nail you against a wall with your feet dangling. I felt like a toy, and it was amazing! There's something about big, strong hands moving me where he wants me that just feels so dang good."

"Put two fingers into her as deep as you can with the pinkie and pointer finger extended along the lips while your other hand is on her pubic mound. Pull in the direction of her belly with your fingers. You can be fairly rough. It apparently feels fantastic based on how she orgasms and climaxes. It's somewhat taxing on the arm, though."

"The longer the foreplay, the better. Some people get frustrated and upset by this, while others go bananas. Also, tilting your face to the side when performing oral sex on her so you can actually breathe. Porn actors do it to open the camera angle, but I'm telling you, you can perform oral sex for so much longer when you can breathe."
—u/LineRex

"Having sex with a stripper. The last woman I dated does pole classes, and she wanted to show me some of the moves she had learned. She put on the heels and a sexy outfit, did a sexy striptease dance routine to music, then gave me a lap dance. After, she masturbated while I watched, and then we had incredible sex. It was by far the hottest thing any woman I’ve ever been with has done with me."

"When performing oral sex on a woman, it's hard to continually (and properly) spread the labia to stimulate the clitoris. A more effective approach is to wrap your arm around her leg and spread it apart from the top with your thumb and pointer fingers. By doing this, your other hand is free to stimulate the rest of her vulva. It's so much more comfortable. Since a lot of men don't perform oral sex on women, they don't focus on the clitoris and G-spot. By doing this simultaneously, a woman can get mind-blowing orgasms."

"When he puts his fingers in my mouth and I bite them. I never enjoyed sex with him — it always felt like a chore. But one day he asked me what I wanted to try, and I saw videos of guys sticking their fingers in girls' mouths while they sucked on them. I wanted to try it, and as for the biting, I've always been interested. Once we did it, I highly enjoyed it. I no longer find sex boring. He also said he likes it when I suck his fingers (especially after he’s used them on me)."
—u/Mysterious-Lynx-4617

"Pegging, though I'm not sure it was the pegging alone that was so good. I think it was because the woman who was pegging me got veryyyyyy turned on."
—u/CthulhusSoreTentacle"Enthusiasm from the woman is key. I've had some women do it who were just mildly curious, and it's really only okay if the other person is so-so about it. When it comes to anal sex, there's a fine line between feeling pleasurable and feeling uncomfortable."—u/HonestButtholeReview
12.
"A highly pleasurable sexual position is when two women are resting on top of each other on the edge of a bed, and a man stands there penetrating them at random intervals. While this is happening, the two women are kissing each other. I've wanted to do this ever since I first saw it who knows how many years ago. I finally got to do it about three months ago. The other version of this is when two women perform oral sex on each other, and I go from performing oral sex on one woman to kissing the other woman's mouth."

"I actually tried this for the first time two nights ago, and it worked much better than expected. For background, my boyfriend and I are both trans men. Last time I slept at his place, we used a strap-on dildo. I asked him to try out a specific position I’d seen in porn a few times. Typically, with a straight couple, a woman would be flat on her stomach with her head slightly elevated by propping up her arms. The man is resting on top of her with his forearm holding up her upper body. This way, he has a strong grip and can penetrate her from behind. I imagine it feels quite good for someone with a penis, legs locked, so it’s nice and secure. But even with no penises involved, it felt really good to me. Even though we were performing this sexual position for me, I noticed his movement getting more intense. He actually ended up ejaculating for the first time ever while penetrating me."
"Usually we’d pleasure each other in a desperate manner, but with this position, we were able to orgasm at the same time. I didn’t ejaculate until later, when my buttocks was elevated.The elation of having him ejaculate like that felt exciting. And on a psychological level, being held like that was a big turn-on for me. I highly recommend this position!"—u/John-Smith12

"The 'come here' motion with your fingers inside of her vagina. Eventually, I took this to the next level. You grip your penis by the base, and then use the head to lightly rest on her vagina. You want to move it in an upward and downward position so it excites her G-spot, and also rubs the clitoris on the up and down strokes. Master this and you’ll need to invest in waterproof sheets."
—u/UnclePonch
15.
"Treat the clitoris like it's a penis. I watched this semi-instructional video of a woman performing oral sex on another woman. She said, 'Pretend you're giving it a blowjob.' I thought that was hilarious, but it stuck in my mind, and by god, it worked! I then remembered all the times I rubbed a girl's clitoris like I was DJ, and immediately equated it to her doing the same thing to the tip of my penis. At that moment, I realized how awful some of those early sexual experiences must have been for those poor women, and ever since have used the 'treat the clitoris like a penis' technique. The old saying is true: Treat others how you want to be treated."

"Having sex while other people are having sex next to you. It honestly just feels so freeing."
—u/BootySharingCouple

"Sensual massages are amazing. Both of you are fully nude, you rub coconut oil on each other, and have a guilty pleasure TV show on in the background. We try to give legitimate and relaxing full body massages, knowing where the party will eventually end."
—u/creepyguygooddad

"When I'm penetrating her while her hands and knees are down on the bed, I use a mouthful of spit and let it drip into her anus. The surprised face she gets is priceless."
—u/Main-Ad5113

"Both you and your partner are nude in a private sauna. You both drop your towels at the same time, seeing each other nude. Then you sensually rub your bodies against each other."
—u/one_koala
20.
"I learned to take my penis out of her vagina when you're about to ejaculate, then you immediately switch to performing oral sex on her. You return to penetrating her when you're not peaked, so your erection lasts longer."
—u/Lust2228

"I have spent yeaaars dreaming about a man ejaculating a large amount of semen inside of me. Once it happened, it was such a high. Not because of the feeling itself, but to see the guy ejaculate that hard inside of me was epic. I wish we could do it more often."

"Having a threesome with two friends with benefits who know each other. The way they look at you and each other, thinking, 'So this is how they usually have sex,' was one of the most wholesome things to be part of."
—u/NeutronFart
23.
"Maintain rhythm to help a woman have a satisfying orgasm. A lot of men seem to think that when women are 'getting close' to having an orgasm, they should penetrate her at a faster pace. I was among them, but not anymore. If your woman is getting close, it means whatever rhythm you're using is working. Keep it up."
—u/Acriam
24.
"A lot of women are turned on by verbal expression. Dirty talk can be awkward, but sexy, sincere talk is very energizing. Things like, 'Damn, I’ll never get enough of your body,' or 'You make me happy,' or 'God, I’ll never let you go now.' Things like that — awkward sex talk is laughable. Things like, 'Imma bang you so hard,' or 'I’m gonna eff your brains out.' It’s not that hot, ya know (at least not to me)."
—u/LieInternational3741

And finally, "Performing missionary anal sex. We had trouble trying anal sex because my wife is petite, so trying and trying different angles was never comfortable for her. My wife is petite, so trying and trying different angles was never comfortable for her. Until I watched a video where the guy puts a big pillow under the girl's hips and penetrates her on the corner of the bed...that's our favorite pose now."
