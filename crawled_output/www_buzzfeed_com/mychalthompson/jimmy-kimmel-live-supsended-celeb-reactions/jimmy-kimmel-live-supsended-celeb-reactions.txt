Disney's ABC decided to pull Jimmy Kimmel Live! from the network "indefinitely" after the host made comments about the killing of Charlie Kirk.

On Monday, Jimmy suggested the suspected shooter in Charlie's assassination could've had right-wing views, which led to threats of penalties from FCC Chair Brendan Carr.Â The chair suggested that ABC and Disney take action, and the FCC could potentially penalize other broadcasters for airing the late-night show.
Celebrities, media personalities, and politicians everywhere are criticizing ABC's decision to remove Jimmy Kimmel Live! â€” here's what they're saying:
1.
Wanda Sykes, who was set to be an upcoming guest on the show, posted on Instagram, criticizing Donald Trump's administration. "Letâ€™s see. He didnâ€™t end the Ukraine war or solve Gaza within his first week," Wanda said. "But he did end freedom of speech within his first year. Hey, for those of you who pray, nowâ€™s the time to do it. Love you, Jimmy."

Though I didnâ€™t agree at ALL with Charlie Kirk; his shooting death sickened me; and should have sickened any decent human being. What is happening to our country?"

Former CNN broadcast journalist Jim Acosta said Jimmy Kimmel is a "class act" and shared how the late-night host stood up for him. "He very thoughtfully asked whether I was receiving adequate security at that time, as Trump was repeatedly smearing journalists as 'the enemy of the people,' comments that resulted in threats aimed at many of us in the White House Press Corps. Iâ€™ll never forget that moment of kindness from Jimmy. It spoke volumes. Make no mistake, our right to free speech is under attack in this country. This right must be defended as it is essential to the American way of life."
