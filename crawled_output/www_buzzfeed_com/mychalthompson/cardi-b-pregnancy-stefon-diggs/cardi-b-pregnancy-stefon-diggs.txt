After weeks of speculation, on a Sept. 17 appearance on CBS Mornings with Gayle King, the Grammy winner revealed she's pregnant with baby no. 4.

When Gayle asked if Cardi wanted to share anything about the pregnancy rumors with the class, she responded, "Well, yes."

"I'm having a baby with my boyfriend Stefon Diggs," she said. "I've been putting in all this work, but I'm doing all this work while I'm creating a baby."

Cardi shares three children with rapper Offset: Kulture, 7, Wave, 4, and Blossom, 1. She filed for divorce for a second time on July 31, 2024.
While she explained to Gayle that she was reluctant to fall in love again, she was very optimistic about her current relationship. "I'm happy. I feel like I'm in a good space. I feel very strong. I feel very powerful that I'm doing all this work," Cardi said.

"But I'm doing all this work while I'm creating a baby. Me and my man are very supportive of each other. We, like, in the same space in our careers. You know what it is, that I feel like we're really great and one of the best at what we do," she continued, speaking to their similar work ethic.
"He just makes me feel safe and very confident," Cardi said of her relationship with Stefon. "And it makes you feel like you could take over the world."

Stefon has played for the Minnesota Vikings, Buffalo Bills, and Houston Texans, and recently signed a three-year deal with the Patriots.
Cardi explained why she held off sharing the news despite the online speculation. "Can I just say it in my own time? I'm not hiding," she said. "Let me close some deals first... Let me see a couple of more sonograms. Let my baby be healthy."

Fans shouldn't worry too much, because it even took a while for her family to learn about her pregnancy. The "Up" rapper admitted that she hadn't even told her parents. At the time of filming the interview, she shared that she's "scared of them" with a smile on her face.

In classic comedic Cardi fashion, she used the pregnancy to make a joke to promote her upcoming album. "Now y'all could buy my album so I can buy Pampers and diapers and all that type of stuff," she said. "I told you. Now go support my album, 'cause I'm a mother of four now."

Fans across the internet are happy the pregnancy is now official, sharing their congratulations for the couple.

Others called out people who didn't believe she was pregnant all this time.

And then other fans worried that her pregnancy might cancel her forthcoming tour.

But, according to Cardi "by the time tour comes [she'll] be doing splits, somersaults backflips and handstands," so don't be too concerned about a cancellation.

As someone who saw her twerk on a pole at Coachella while she was physically pregnant with Kulture, she's serious. I don't think baby no. 4 is going to ruin the tour.
