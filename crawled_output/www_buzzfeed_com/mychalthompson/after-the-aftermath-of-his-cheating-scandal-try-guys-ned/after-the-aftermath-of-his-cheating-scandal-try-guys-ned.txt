On Sept. 17, Ned Fulmer — the ex-BuzzFeed Try Guys co-creator — was joined by Ariel Fulmer on his new podcast, Rock Bottom With Ned Fulmer, to talk about the aftermath of his infidelity.

In 2022, Ned, aka the "wife guy," broke the internet when his infidelity was exposed. The remaining Try Guys, at the time, released a video claiming how they learned of the news of Ned's behavior, and he was no longer part of the group.

Ned left the spotlight until recently, when he spoke to People before his podcast premiere. In the interview, Ned said his indiscretion "was most devastating to work through and to realize — how much pain" he caused for Ariel.
"It's pretty well known that I was presenting myself as a wife guy who talked about his adorable relationship. It was something fans seemed to resonate with, and I leaned into it consciously. It certainly was a part of my life."

Ned said he and Ariel were moving forward as a couple, but it was later reported that they had separated after 15 years together.

Now, in the episode of Rock Bottom, Ariel finally had the opportunity to speak about the relationship, and she didn't hold back.

"People ask me, 'Do you forgive Ned for what he did?'" Ariel said. "And the answer is no. Absolutely not. How can you forgive somebody for lying to you? For cheating on you. No. Fuck no."
Ariel was not in a position to forgive or forget.

"Sorry. I saw red for a minute," she continued. "But also, I feel like forgiveness isn't the goal at this point."
While Ariel said she's not forgiving, she maintained that she and Ned are friendly. They share two sons, Wesley, 7, and Finn, 4.

"We've been together for a long time, and you are the father of my two beautiful children," she said. "The fact that I can be around you and still have a good time and enjoy spending time with you and spending time with my kids, I think that's a win."
Ned also shared that their relationship is amicable for the benefit of their family.

"We are still friends. We have children together. We go on trips together," Ned said. "There is a spectrum of being together-not together. There's ways in which we're together, but the way that everyone wants to know like, 'Are you still, like, an item? Are you still a couple?' No."
Elsewhere in the podcast, Ariel shared remorse for not recognizing what was happening to her relationship sooner, seemingly referring to the photos from 2022 that sparked the fallout.

Ariel continued, "I was so blindsided that somebody sent me a picture, and I couldn't — it was like my brain couldn't compute.""For some reason, I couldn't see what was actually there. I thought it was your sister. And I remember sending it to you and being like, 'What's your sister doing in New York?'"
She continued, "How did I not see what was going on? What was so fucked up in my brain that I couldn't actually see what was happening in this picture?" she added. "The picture was right there in front of me."
