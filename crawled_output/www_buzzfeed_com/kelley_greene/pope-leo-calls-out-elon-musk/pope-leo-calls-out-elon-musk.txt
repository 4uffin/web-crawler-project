You remember Pope Leo, of course. Our first-ever American pontiff, a White Sox fan, and the former owner of a very cool mustache.

Well, in a recent interview for an upcoming biography, he discussed his thoughts on the role of the papacy, advocating for peace, and more. When asked about the polarization the world is facing, he said, "I don’t pretend to have all the answers, but I certainly see the reality in some of the results."
One factor he suggested is very significant "is the continuously wider gap between the income levels of the working class and the money that the wealthiest receive. For example, CEOs that 60 years ago might have been making four to six times more than what the workers are receiving, the last figure I saw, it’s 600 times more than what average workers are receiving."
He continued, "Yesterday the news [said] that Elon Musk is going to be the first trillionaire in the world. What does that mean and what’s that about? If that is the only thing that has value anymore, then we’re in big trouble."

Folks had a LOT to say about the comments. Many were happy to hear the pope bring up wealth inequality, calling it "An encouraging sign that Pope Leo is taking up the mantle...as the world's moral conscience."

"We did not need the Pope to tell us this is wrong. ... But perhaps his voice will wake people up."

"At a certain point the question needs to be asked. How much wealth should a single person have?"
@zainzaidi99 / Via x.com
"How can ANYONE...think that this is a good thing for our society? That ONE MAN should hoard this much wealth while children in his own country, state, city starve & are homeless?"

"Pope Leo is spitting truths, just as anyone who knows anything about Chicago was sure he would."

"New pope even more goated."

Still, some weren't happy with what Pope Leo had to say, calling the statement from the Pope "woke."

Finally, Elon himself later replied, quoting a Bible passage while sharing a tweet about the amount of money held by the Vatican:
