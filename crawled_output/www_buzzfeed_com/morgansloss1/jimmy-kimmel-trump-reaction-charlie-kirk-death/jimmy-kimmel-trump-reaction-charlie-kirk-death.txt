"He's at the fourth stage of grief: construction," Jimmy joked.

"This is not how an adult grieves the murder of someone he called a friend," he continued. "This is how a 4-year-old mourns a goldfish." Jimmy noted this isn't the first time Trump has mentioned the White House ballroom renovation and Kirk in the same breath.

In the next clip, Trump told Fox News hosts, "When I heard, I was in the midst of building a great â€” for 150 years, they've wanted a ballroom at the White House, right? They don't have a ballroom. They have to use tents on the lawn for [events for Chinese] President Xi when he comes over, if it rains, it's a wipeout. And so, I was with the architects that were designing â€” it's gonna be incredible."

"And they came in. They said, 'Charlie Kirk is dead.' I didn't know what they meant. I said, 'What do you mean dead?' 'Charlie Kirk was shot.' And they thought he was dead because it was so horrific, you know. And I said, 'Dead.'"

Jimmy mocked Trump with a joke about chandeliers and sconces, receiving laughter and applause.

More seriously, he said there's "something wrong" with Trump, wondering, "Who thinks like that?"

"And why are we building a $200-million ballroom in the White House? Is it possible that he's doing it intentionally so we can be mad about that instead of the Epstein List?" he asked, drawing cheers from the audience.

Naturally, people had a lot to say in the comments of the YouTube video:
One person wrote, "He doesnâ€™t want Charlie Kirk to get more attention than him."

Another said, "People are hurting, losing healthcare, losing food support, and heâ€™s planning a ballroom. Talk about priorities!"

"When the Reporter asked Donald Trump about Charlie Kirk! The full Blown
Narcissism was on full View!"
ABC / youtube.com
"Itâ€™s wild when someone turns a question about someoneâ€™s death into a mirror for their ego. At some point, leadership should look out, not in."

And finally, "The questions weren't about him, so he needed to act. Even a narcissist would say he loves himself too much."
