We asked members of the BuzzFeed Community to reveal who they slept with that no one can ever know about. Here are their juicy stories:
1.
"My best friend in high school got his girlfriend pregnant. She had the kid and gave them up for adoption. We all attended the same State College, a 2-hour drive from home. I was only casually acquainted with her, but one Sunday she called me needing a ride back to school. After arriving at her dormitory, I helped her carry some boxes into her room…on the drive, she had been trash-talking her baby daddy, so I guess I took the opportunity to proposition her, to which she enthusiastically agreed! After we finished having wild 18-year-old college student sex, she asked where I had been all of her life. Then she proceeded to tell me that I was bigger than my best friend, which evidently quite surprised her. We agreed that we should keep our little tryst a secret and never do it again, and that is a thing I often regret."

"I slept with my friend’s brother at her wedding. The interesting thing is, she knows about it and is totally cool. What she doesn’t know is that her brother is really bad in bed. I didn't know what to say to her when she asked me whether I would get together with him again."

"I was a married man in my mid-30s and had always wanted to see what it was like to be with a guy. So I downloaded Grindr randomly, and within 72 hours, I had started a multi-year, FWB relationship with a 50-year-old guy. It was quite exhilarating, but eventually the rush had subsided, and we parted ways. "

"We were college friends, and life took us on different paths. We've kept in touch for 16 years. We were both in dark times and helped each other. Then somehow it turned into the best sex of our lives. We're still hooking up now. His wife is awful to him, so I love that he can find comfort in this when life gets rough."

"I slept with my ex-wife’s sister when she was my fiancée, before we were wed. She wanted it to continue, but I didn't."

"I slept with my first wife’s sister and with my second wife’s sister. Both were pretty good."

"I slept with my sister-in-law, my brother-in-law's wife. We have known each other for 37 years as friends. She needed a job done in her house, and as we reacquainted, it slowly became more than friendship. We are both overtly sexual and couldn’t help ourselves. She is a tremendous lover, the best I’ve ever experienced."

"I entered a local bar in small town America and spied an all grown up former babysitter having drinks with her younger sister. I hadn’t seen them in years, and they hadn't been my babysitter in decades. My wife had always made the sitter arrangements. She went through contacts from church, so we knew the parents of the sitters from services. In this chance meeting, time had gone on. I was divorced, and those girls had grown up. Still, there was enough of an age difference; I thought it was innocent enough to keep them company and get caught up on how life turned out for them. It wasn’t many drinks when they divulged they had crushes on me back when they sat my kids and fantasized about me then, on the ride home, I would give them, and at church services! In spite of being uncle age, they still wanted to push through with that. The elder of the two was forward about it, and we left the bar together that evening."

"When I was living with my older sister, I slept with her best friend. One night, I walked into the house, and there was my sister, a guy she was dating, and Doris. We had a few drinks and then I excused myself because I had to work early the next day. An hour or so later, Doris walked into my room and propositioned me. It was quite a night."

"Let’s just say I was very charming growing up. I slept with my brother’s ex-girlfriend. I slept with both of my best friend's older sisters. I also slept with my high school best friend’s younger sister. I slept with my cousin's wife. I also slept with my coworker's wife. I was a terrible person."

"I slept with twins at the same time. We were all three on the same soccer team. I am now married to one of them, and the other is married to a man. We never talk about it."

"I asked my professor a question after class. He invited me to his place for breakfast. I knew I was on the menu. He was so much fun, and the sex was great. We went out for a while, but we knew it was just friends with benefits."

And finally, "This happened many years ago when I was in the police academy for five months. We had this really cute defensive tactics instructor who had this gorgeous buffed body. As part of the training, we had to go on a police ride-along. This instructor was also a sergeant in the local police department, so I got to ride around with him for an entire shift. The chemistry in the patrol car during that 8-hour shift was palpable. As soon as he got off shift, we went to a bar and had a couple of drinks. Later, I was able to show him some of my own physical arrest techniques inside his pickup truck. It was a great one-night stand, but we both knew that’s all it was. He was married, and I had a boyfriend back at home. However, it was just the sort of release I needed for a very stressful period in my life. Needless to say, I passed all of my defensive tactics classes with flying colors. I never saw him again after graduation, and to my knowledge, no one ever found out. "
