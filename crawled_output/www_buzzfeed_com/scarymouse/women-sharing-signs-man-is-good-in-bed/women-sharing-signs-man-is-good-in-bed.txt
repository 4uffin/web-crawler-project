Men who love kissing and don’t rush it see how it’s a sensual activity, and not just a button they have to press to get in your panties."by Julia CorriganBuzzFeed ContributorFacebookPinterestLink
Recently, I saw a post from user Mobile-Carrot-3218 over on the Reddit page Ask Women No Censor asking, "How can you tell when a man is going to be good in bed?"
Fox / ABC / Via giphy.com
She added a little context, writing that she "was having this conversation with some girlfriends [about] how we can spot the signs a man will be good in bed. I said the ones who are good in bed are very gentle and caring in their everyday life. At least the ones I’ve noticed. Curious to hear anyone else’s take on this."
People chimed in with answers that ranged from funny to very real, and honestly, I thought it would be useful and entertaining to share. So, here are some of the best:
1.
"The kissing is the tell for me. Men who love kissing and don’t rush it see how it’s a sensual activity, and not just a button they have to press to get in your panties."

"Guitarists with advanced playing skills."

"My guy friend, a guitarist who used to tour with and record/produce in the studio for some big-name rockers in the '90s and 2000s, said they’re called 'micromovements.'"—u/Revolutionary-Hat-96
3.
"High emotional intelligence is by far the greatest predictor that I've found. If he's willing to listen to what you have to say without prejudice, then he is mature enough to take direction and generally has a desire to please, not just to say he's good at pleasing women for his own ego, but because he wants to please you specifically."

4.
"I honestly think some quiet confidence is a big indicator of this. A lot of niceness alone is not going to cut it for me, a bit of tease and confident flirting shows they're also feeling desire, which translates better in bed."

"When he doesnt brag about it."

6.
"When he's genuinely curious about me and my life, asks questions, listens to the answers attentively, and remembers them later. (And it doesn't have to be a conversation about sex; the same goes for all areas of life.) Also, he doesn't slut-shame people (me or anyone else), isn't interested in concepts like 'body count,' and is generally not awkward about sexual topics, but also not boastful either. The latter is important!"
—u/Lia_the_nun
7.
"I don't think you can tell if he's going to be good, but there are red flags for a potential bad experience, like selfishness and arrogance."
—u/worried19
8.
"The best ones are the men who have an easygoing vibe about them. Relaxed shoulders, laughs freely, doesn't feel attacked when you question or correct them. Also, they don’t usually talk about sex, and if they do make a sex joke, it’s mature and tasteful, and usually quite clever. I’ve noticed they are all respectful towards women as well, not just being polite, but like they look up to certain women."
Warner Bros.

9.
"If he's curious about your life in general, he's going to be curious about what turns you on. Most men who are selfish in bed are also selfish emotionally — they love you for what you do for them, not for who you are. That's a problem in and out of the bedroom."
—u/littleorangemonkeys
10.
"I find men who've been in long-term relationships in the past to be better in bed."
ABC
—u/IHaveABigDuvet"I have found this to be false more than true…it’s been surprising."—u/fitvampfire
11.
"Define 'good in bed.' I talk to my friend, and we have really different criteria for what we like. So, different men would be good for us. There are some that work for me and others, but again, not all."
—u/Lemon_gecko"Men who are good in bed are good communicators and will be able to adapt to fit the situation and lover. Same with women. Sex skill is more about communication than technical skill in performing any given sex act."—u/metsfan5557
12.
"How physical intimacy feels; is there chemistry? Also, does he look at you, past you, through you, or into you…the last one is your man."
HBO
—u/HearMeOutMkay
13.
"Men who are attentive and caring outside the bedroom are almost always attentive and caring inside the bedroom."
—u/sisterfunkhaus
14.
"I'm in my 40s and there's really no way to tell unless you've already slept with the guy. It sucks that there's no way to be psychic about this."
TBS / Via giphy.com
"I will say that the worst ones in bed were the men who had a bunch of one-night stands, which I know doesn't make sense. But yeah...terrible. I was in relationships with two of those guys. Even though they'd slept with a ton of women, they didn't know jack shit about pleasing a woman....Then there was one guy I was with who was obviously inexperienced. His hygiene was also deplorable. I was young...forgive me, sisters."—u/MoodyMagicOwl
15.
"I think a lot of male sexual performance comes down to athletic ability and erectile stamina. At least for me it does."
HBO / Via giphy.com
—u/Seltzer-Slut
16.
"Someone who knows how to dance."
Paramount Pictures / Via giphy.com
—u/kkeojyeo22"Julia Louis-Dreyfus once expressed concern over a Seinfeld storyline portraying her character, Elaine, as a terrible dancer. She feared audiences might interpret this as implying Elaine — and by extension, Louis-Dreyfus herself — was bad in bed. Evidently, she subscribed to the notion that good dancers are generally perceived as good lovers. I hadn’t heard that belief before, but it has a certain logic to it."—u/Tall-Needleworker422
17.
"Don’t know about good, but I know if he doesn’t want to tip waitstaff and is stingy about time with you, he will probably be bad."
ABC / Via giphy.com
—u/Huge-Recognition-366
18.
"If he's interested in your thoughts and opinions, that indicates he's a good listener and takes you seriously. The best sexual partner I ever had would often solicit my opinion after he shared something — he actively wanted to hear what I thought."
—u/tibleon8
19.
"If they can kiss. I've learned if a man can't kiss, then they are absolutely awful in bed."
Walt Disney Pictures / Via giphy.com

"Men who are great dancers are great lovers."
Paramount Pictures
"Not the 'humping' on the dance floor, but the men who have rhythm and can stay in step with you. Also, obviously, the men who don't watch porn. It's shocking how they make love with you and not to you. Night-and-day difference."—u/MyHonestOpnion
21.
And finally: "Have sex with him and see if he’s good. That’s literally the only way."
The CW
