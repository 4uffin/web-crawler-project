Melissa Hortman Is Going Viral"I'm not familiar. Theâ€¦who?"by Alana ValkoBuzzFeed StaffFacebookPinterestLinkHot TopicðŸ”¥ Full coverage and conversation on Politics
Last week, conservative political spokesperson Charlie Kirk was assassinated while speaking at Utah Valley University. Soon after, Trump ordered the US flag to be flown at half-staff "as a mark of respect for the memory of Charlie Kirk."

People were quick to compare Trump's response to the assassination of Kirk to that of the Democratic Minnesota Representative, Melissa Hortman. Hortman and her husband, Mark, were shot and killed in their home by a masked shooter disguised as a police officer on June 14. The shooter also shot and wounded Sen. John Hoffman, a Democrat, and his wife, Yvette, in their home shortly before.

At the time, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz called the back-to-back shootings a "politically-motivated assassination." On Truth Social, Trump wrote that "such horrific violence will not be tolerated" in the US. But when asked by a reporter if he'd call Tim Walz after the attack, he replied no, saying it'd be a "waste of time."

"I think the governor of Minnesota is so whacked out. I'm not calling him," Trump said. "Why would I call him? I could call and say, 'Hi, how you doing?' Uh, the guy doesn't have a clue. He's a mess. I could be nice and call, but why waste time?"
Now, a reporter asked Trump on Monday if, looking back, he'd also want to lower the flags in honor of Melissa Hortman as he did for Charlie Kirk. "I'm not familiar. Theâ€¦who?" he replied.

"The Minnesota House Speaker, a Democrat, who was assassinated this summer," the reporter said back.

"Oh," he said. "Well, if the governor had asked me to do that, I would have done that. But the governor of Minnesota didn't ask me. I didn't, uh, I wouldn't have thought of that, but I would've, if somebody had asked me."

"People make requests for the lowering the flag and oftentimes you have to say no because it would be a lot of lowering. The flag would never be up," he said. "Had the governor of Minnesota asked me to do that, I would have done that gladly."

"Simply unbelievable. Trump didn't even order the flags lowered when she was killed. He refused to call Minnesota leaders, refused to offer condolences, refused to show up at her funeral," another wrote, comparing his response to Joe Biden's, who attended Hortman's funeral.Simply unbelievable.
