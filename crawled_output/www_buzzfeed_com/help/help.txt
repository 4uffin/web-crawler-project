How to Use BuzzFeed
What is BuzzFeed?
BuzzFeed is a place for you to discover, share, and keep up with everything awesome that’s happening on the Internet as soon as it happens!
How do I post to BuzzFeed?
Sign up for an account here, and then you’re all set to make quizzes, create lists, and comment on your favorite posts. Make sure to check out our simple guidelines before posting, and then have some fun!
Here are some examples of posts for inspiration:
Personality quizzes
Trivia quizzes
Checklist quizzes
Different types of lists, like rankings, relatable ones, or whatever else you come up with!
Nostalgic posts
Again, if you need help getting started, make sure to check out our guides above. Please note that it’s up to our editors if a post gets featured on our homepage.
If your post or quiz is selected to get featured across BuzzFeed's network, our editors ~may~ make a few edits to it to reflect the BuzzFeed style and tone! This includes edits to some copy and images (for more on image FAQs, check out this helpful guide)!
What should I post to BuzzFeed?
Post unique, funny, interesting quizzes or lists that you’ve made yourself that you’re proud of. You can really never go wrong when expressing your love for anything pop culture, so that’s always a good place to start! As always, just make sure whatever you make is within our guidelines!
What should I avoid posting to BuzzFeed?
Porn, spam, links to your blog, articles for clients, or anything else that’s against our guidelines. Don’t post those things, as they will likely result in the removal of your account or curtailment of your posting privileges. :(
I’m a teacher looking to use BuzzFeed Community as an education tool. What should I know?
We love that you’re using our platform for your classes! Make sure to check out our guide for teachers and professors for all the info on how to get started.
What happens to the stuff I post to BuzzFeed?
Once you publish a post it will be sent to our Community Editors, where they’ll take a look at it and decide if it would be fitting for a homepage feature! Please note, if your post or quiz is selected to get featured across BuzzFeed's network, our editors may make a few edits to it to reflect the BuzzFeed style and tone.This includes edits to some copy and images (for more on image FAQs, check out this helpful guide)!
How do you decide which Community posts get promoted to the homepage?
Our editors choose what gets posted to the homepage.
What is BuzzFeed’s editorial style?
Glad you asked! You can take a peek at our Style Guide here.
How does BuzzFeed handle timestamps?
Timestamps in our posts reflect the timezone where the reader is located. If an editor in New York publishes a post at 2:03 pm, a reader in Los Angeles will see the post’s publication time as 11:03 am.
Something offended me. What do I do?
Let us know using this form. Do not respond to the person who offended you — it only makes them worse.
I posted something first but it didn’t get featured. Why?
Yikes. This one’s a tough one. First of all: It’s not personal. Buuuuut...here are a few possible reasons why your thing didn’t get featured:
It just didn’t fit the BuzzFeed vibe
The post may have required too much editing
The content of the post was something that was posted multiple times by users and editors on BuzzFeed already
We just missed it — we’re not perfect!
How do badges and awards get assigned?
Our main badges (LOL, Win, Cute, etc) are assigned by BuzzFeed algorithms which take the number of corresponding reactions a post gets, its viral traffic, and editorial merit into account. You can also earn trophies and Internet Points when you create quizzes or lists that are within certain themes, or when your quiz or list earns a certain amount of views!
What are Reactions?
Reactions are a simple way for you to express your reaction to a post. We use these signals to help badge, categorize, and feature the best content.
Technical Support
I’ve forgotten my password! Can you please help me?
Take a deep breath, find your happy place, and then go to the sign-in page and click the “Forgot Password” link. Enter the email address you used when you registered; your password will be reset and a new one will be sent to you. Then, sign in with your username and new password at the same sign-in page you started at!
I never got my validation email! Where is it?
Unless you signed up with a social media account, you will need to validate your email address. If you never received the validation email try going to the sign-in page and click the “Forgot Password” link. Then enter the email address you used when you registered. A new validation email will be sent. If you still don’t get that email please let us know.
How do I edit or delete a post?
If you'd like to edit your post, make sure you're logged in, then head to community.buzzfeed.com (this is your drafts page). Hover over your post, and a pencil icon should show up. Click on that to make edits. If you’re having trouble making edits or deleting a post, feel free to reach out to us at communityhelp@buzzfeed.com.
Why can’t I edit or delete my post?
If your post has been promoted to the homepage you will no longer be able to edit it anymore. If you find a typo or want to change something at that point feel free to email our editors and they will do their best to accommodate your request.
Can I edit or delete my comments?
You can now edit and delete your comments as a logged-in user on mobile, desktop, and in our iOS app. If you need further assistance, feel free to reach out to us at communityhelp@buzzfeed.com.
How do I remove someone else’s comment from my post?
You cannot remove a comment someone else has made on your post. Feel free to flag comments if you feel they are spam or abusive. Our editors will try their best to remove inappropriate comments as soon as possible!
How do I change my name, photo, or other details?
From your settings page (there’s also a link next to your name in the top right of every page). From there you can change all your public profile information.
How do I change my email address or password?
From your settings page click the “Account Settings” tab. From there you can enter a new email address and change your password.
How do I change my username?
While you can change how your username appears on the site (see 2 questions up from here), you cannot change your username. BuzzFeed is all about getting posts linked to from all over the web so we are very careful not to ever break links. Since your username is your URL for all your posts (http://buzzfeed.com/username/post-name), doing so would break all links to your existing posts. That would make everyone sad. If you really, really need a different username, you can always just create a new account.
How do I customize my page?
From your settings page (there’s also a link next to your name in the top right of every page). From there you can update a fancy banner image, add links to your Twitter and Facebook pages, and more. In the future we may add more customization options.
From your settings page (there’s also a link next to your name in the top right of every page). From there you can update a fancy banner image, add links to your Twitter and Facebook pages, and more. Make sure to stay within our guidelines when linking to other pages in your bio — unfortunately if your bio or page is against those guidelines, this could result in your account getting removed! In the future, we may add more customization options.
How do I turn on notifications about posts I've made?
If you opt-in, we’ll send you either a text or email when a post of yours is promoted to the homepage. To change this setting go to your settings page, scroll down to “Account Settings,” and check your preferred method of contact underneath the section that reads “Send me an email when…”
What is “Log in with Facebook, Google, or Apple?”
These are services offered by Facebook, Google, and Apple so you can sign in to BuzzFeed using your login credentials from the accounts you already have on these platforms. Just click the “Sign in with Facebook,” “Sign in with Google,” or “Sign in with Apple” button when you sign up for your account and then every time you log in after that!
Advertising and Partnerships
How do I advertise on BuzzFeed?
If you’re a large brand or company looking to run a major viral advertising campaign, we’ve got a very exciting platform for you! Learn more and reach out to our advertising team here.
What does "Brand Publisher" mean?
The “Brand Publisher” designation you see on some posts and thumbnails on BuzzFeed means that the content is brought to you either by the editorial partnerships that make up the BuzzFeed Network or our advertising partners.
How can I apply to be a Brand Publisher?
You can reach out to our advertising team at this page.

Scams
How can I spot scams that involve BuzzFeed?
People may falsely represent themselves as employees of BuzzFeed, or otherwise having some sort of official connection to BuzzFeed, via email, WhatsApp, SMS or on social media such as Facebook or Instagram. Typically, these scammers are trying to trick you into handing over personal or social account login information. They may also try to trick you into providing financial information such as your banking account information.
Advertising Scam
Advertising scammers will offer you money in exchange for sharing “sponsored ads” on your Facebook page or other social media profiles. They will then trick you into providing them admin control of your page, then take it over and steal control of the page.
Casting/Job Scams
In Casting and Job Scams, people will falsely represent themselves as BuzzFeed recruiters in order to trick you into sharing your personal information, sending them money,
buying goods or services from associates of theirs, or providing access to your financial accounts.
Beware of the following:
Anyone offering you money for advertising services, or asking you for money for any reason.
Anyone asking for your banking or other financial account information.
Anyone directing you to buy a specific good/service.
Contact from anyone via an email domain other than @buzzfeed.com or @huffpost.com. (For instance, “buzzfeed_official@gmail.com” is not an official BuzzFeed email address).
Any job application process that doesn’t require you to submit your application through https://www.buzzfeed.com/about/jobs.
Anyone proposing an interview via text message.
You can contact us here if you want to confirm whether the person you are speaking with is a BuzzFeed employee.
