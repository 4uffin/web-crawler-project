To everyone using AI in their dating profiles: we can tell.

Why would a woman want to sleep with a man whose politics are that women don't deserve rights? (Because I stg that's the case 99% of the time that men complain about this.)

...Yeah, this lines up with my impression of Trump supporters.

I hope this man didn't get any matches, but in today's world, he probably did.

I guess expecting people you match with to be kind is asking too much nowadays.

Creeps are still running rampant on dating apps in 2025.

I guess this is what counts as flirting these days? Or people are matching just to make mean comments.

Including an Amazon wishlist in your profile is even more wild.

At least some people on dating apps are still honest...

A test drive is not a thing in dating.

I get crashing out if it was a great date, but do that on your own time; don't spam the person's messages.

Well, that escalated.

One bonus about dating today — you usually see people's red flags right at the start!

And what do you have to offer in return except being a controlling douche?

I have a feeling this guy didn't end up with any "sensual smexy time." Or maybe that's just a hope.

I can't believe people are still claiming superiority over not having gotten the COVID vaccine.
u/_deadload091 / Via reddit.com
27.
Why would he say this? :(
u/WondersomeWalrus / Via reddit.com
28.
Did he really think this would be received well?

I swear, people will get the ick on the smallest thing and then flip on a switch nowadays.
