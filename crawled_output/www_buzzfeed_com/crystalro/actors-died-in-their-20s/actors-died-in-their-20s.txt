What happened:
Chance Perdomo died on March 29, 2024, in a motorcycle accident.
Perdomo, best known for his roles in Chilling Adventures of Sabrina and Gen V, died in a single-vehicle motorcycle accident in upstate New York. He was traveling to Toronto for a table read for the second season of The Boys spinoff Gen V before filming was slated to start. Authorities confirmed that no one else was involved in the crash. The exact location and cause of the crash have not been made public.
Out of respect for his memory, the producers of Gen V chose not to recast his role, instead rewriting parts of the story to honor him.

Cameron Boyce, 20

What happened:
Boyce died in his sleep on July 6, 2019, from sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP).
The Disney Channel star had been living with epilepsy since his teens and had experienced seizures before, including at night. On the night of his death, he suffered a seizure while sleeping and was later found unresponsive by his housemates. Emergency responders attempted resuscitation, but he was pronounced dead at home.
The Los Angeles County Medical Examiner determined the cause to be Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP), a rare but serious risk for people with epilepsy that often occurs during or after a seizure, frequently in sleep.
After his death, Cameron’s family said they hadn’t known about SUDEP and created the Cameron Boyce Foundation to raise awareness, fund epilepsy research, and support causes he cared about.

Angus Cloud, 25

What happened:
Angus died on July 31, 2023. According to CNN, a cause of death has not yet been determined by the Alameda County Coroner.
According to the Oakland Fire Department, Cloud was "already deceased" when first responders were dispatched to his family's home in California.
In a Facebook post on Aug. 4, 2023, Cloud's mother said, "I also want you to know that although my son was in deep grief about his father's untimely death from mesothelioma, his last day was a joyful one. He was reorganizing his room and placing items around the house with intent to stay a while in the home he loved. He spoke of his intent to help provide for his sisters at college, and also help his mom emotionally and financially. He did not intend to end his life. When we hugged goodnight we said how much we loved each other and he said he would see me in the morning. I don't know if or what he may have put in his body after that. I only know that he put his head on the desk where he was working on art projects, fell asleep, and didn't wake up."

Tupac Shakur, 25

What happened:
Shakur died on Sept. 13, 1996, after being shot four times by an unidentified assailant in a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas.
The LA Times reported that doctors at University Medical Center in Las Vegas took out Shakur’s right lung to try to control the internal bleeding. However, Shakur's health worsened, so they placed him on a ventilator. He passed away six days later, with his mother by his side.
In July 2023, the cold case "saw an apparent breakthrough." Police conducted a search of a home in the Las Vegas area and evidence is currently being presented to a Las Vegas grand jury. According to ABC News, "Investigators have long believed the gunman is likely already dead, the victim of a separate shooting two years after the Vegas drive-by. The current investigation could lead to a determination of who was in the car with the gunman when the rounds were fired that killed Tupac. That could lead to someone being charged as an accomplice."

Rebecca Schaeffer, 21

What happened:
Schaeffer was murdered at her Los Angeles home on July 18, 1989, by a stalker.
According to E! News, Schaeffer, who had recently starred in the CBS sitcom My Sister Sam and was allegedly in the running for the lead in Pretty Woman, was waiting at home for a script to be delivered for an audition later that day. Apparently, Schaeffer would be reading for the role of Mary, Michael Corleone's daughter, in The Godfather Part III.
When her door rang at 10:15 a.m., she answered and was fatally shot by an obsessed fan named Robert John Bardo, who had been stalking her. It was reported that he had paid a private investigator $300 to find out where she lived.
"On Oct. 29, 1991, Bardo was convicted of first-degree murder with the special circumstance of lying in wait. That December he was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. He's currently behind bars at Avenal State Prison in California," said E! News.

Jean Harlow, 26

What happened:
Harlow died on June 7, 1937, of uremic poisoning, which spread to her brain. According to Healthline, "Uremia is caused by extreme and usually irreversible damage to your kidneys."
According to a Guardian article at the time, "She was taken ill only ten days ago with internal inflammation, and later she was stated to have almost recovered. To-day, however, she took a sudden turn for the worse. She was removed from her Beverly Hills home to hospital, where she died. The doctors say she never rallied after a relapse last night."
"She had been given two blood transfusions and injections and placed in an oxygen tent, but she lapsed into a coma early to-day and never regained consciousness," the article continued.

Anton Yelchin, 27

What happened:
Yelchin died on June 19, 2016, when his 2015 Cherokee rolled backward down his LA home's driveway, pinning him between a mailbox and a security fence.
Yelchin's parents ended up filing a lawsuit with Fiat Chrysler (the makers of the Jeep Grand Cherokee). That Cherokee model apparently was among 1.1 million vehicles recalled just two months earlier because "regulators said its gear shifters were confusing drivers, causing the SUVs to roll away unexpectedly and leading to dozens of injuries."
According to the lawsuit, Yelchin was not only crushed but "lingered alive for some time, trapped and suffocating until his death." Yelchin's parents, Viktor and Irina Yelchin, reached a confidential settlement with Fiat Chrysler in 2018.

Jonathan Brandis, 27

What happened:
Brandis died by suicide on Nov. 12, 2003, at his home in Los Angeles.
The LAPD released the following statement regarding Brandis's death: "On Nov. 11, 2003, at about 11:40 p.m., a friend of Jonathan Brandis called police to report that the actor had attempted suicide at his apartment, located in the 600 block of Detroit Avenue. Paramedics from the Los Angeles Fire Department responded and transported Brandis to Cedars Sinai Medical Center where he eventually died from his injuries. Brandis was pronounced dead by hospital staff on Nov. 12, 2003, at about 2:45 p.m."
In an interview with People, Brandis's father Greg Brandis said, "Jonathan was very smart, and he was very polite and always easygoing. ... In a sad way, he was probably bipolar. [His death] wasn't due to the entertainment industry. I look back now, and in his 20s, he showed signs of manic depression. I hope that anyone suffering can go get help."

What happened:
Trang died in a car accident on Sept. 3, 2001.
Entertainment Weekly reported that Trang, who was best known for her role as the yellow Power Ranger, was traveling with her friend Angela Rockwood — whose wedding she was set to be a bridesmaid in — when their car, driven by another bridesmaid, veered off the road and crashed into a rock face.
Trang was killed in the crash, Rockwood survived but was left paralyzed, and the driver sustained only minor injuries.

What happened:
Ledger died on Jan. 22, 2008, in an apartment in SoHo that he had been renting, from an accidental overdose of a toxic mix of prescription medications, including painkillers, sleeping pills, and anti-anxiety drugs.
In an Associated Press report, Ledger's uncle, Neil Bell, said the family was shocked: “He was in good spirits and having a wonderful time on this Terry Gilliam movie [The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus]." Johnny Depp, Colin Farrell, and Jude Law ended up stepping in for Ledger, playing "transformations" of his character as he travels through a dream world, in order to help complete the film. At the time, Gilliam said, "Each of the parts played by Johnny, Colin, and Jude is representative of the many aspects of the character that Heath was playing."

Aaliyah, 22

What happened:
Aaliyah died on Aug. 25, 2001, alongside eight other passengers in a small plane crash in the Bahamas.
According to the New York Times, "Aaliyah died on her way back to Miami from the Abaco Islands, where she had finished working on the video for her latest album’s third single, 'Rock the Boat,' directed by Hype Williams."
Later, an investigation into the crash revealed that the pilot had traces of cocaine and alcohol in his body. It was also found that the plane was at least 700 pounds overweight and had been loaded with one more passenger than it was certified to carry.
In 2003, Aaliyah's parents reached an undisclosed settlement in a negligence lawsuit. According to Billboard, her parents sued plane operator Blackhawk International Airways Corp., owners Skystream Inc. and Gilbert Chacon, and flight broker Atlantic Flight Group.

What happened:
Renfro died on Jan. 15, 2008, of an overdose of heroin and morphine. According to the Hollywood Reporter, paramedics had been called to his home at 9 a.m., and he was pronounced dead by the coroner at noon.
Renfro had a history of struggling with drug and alcohol addiction. In a highly-publicized 2005 incident, Renfro was arrested in Los Angeles's Skid Row for allegedly trying to buy heroin. And then in 2006, "he spent 10 days in jail after pleading no-contest to driving while intoxicated and pleading guilty to attempted possession of heroin," according to the Hollywood Reporter.
Renfro was finally laid to rest in his hometown of Knoxville, Tennessee a week later. "The Knoxville News-Sentinel reported that more than 600 people attended the funeral and closed-casket viewing at the Stevens Mortuary in North Knoxville, where a simple arrangement of red, white, and yellow flowers sat next to the casket along with a photograph of the star in his younger, happier days."

According to the New York Times, the television star (and father of Freddie Prinze Jr.) "died at the UCLA Medical Center 33 hours after shooting himself in the head in front of his business agent."
Also, according to the New York Times, Prinze "had just hung up the telephone after talking to his estranged wife, Kathy, mother of his 10-month‐old son, Freddie Jr." He never regained consciousness after firing the gun.
The funeral service for the 22‐year‐old star of Chico and the Man was held at the Old North Church at Forest Lawn in the Hollywood Hills a couple of days later on January 31.

What happened:
Phoenix died on Oct. 31, 1993, outside the Viper Room nightclub in West Hollywood, California. According to an autopsy report, there was "acute multiple drug intoxication including lethal levels of cocaine and morphine."
Speaking to Variety, Deputy Diane Hecht stated that Phoenix collapsed outside the Viper Room nightclub in West Hollywood around 1 a.m. Friends also mentioned he had apparently been "acting strange." Paramedics took him to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where he was declared dead at 1:51 a.m.
In an interview with the Guardian, Phoenix's girlfriend at the time, actor Samantha Mathis recounted, "I knew he [Phoenix] was high that night, but the heroin that killed him didn’t happen until he was in the Viper Room. I have my suspicions about what was going on, but I didn’t see anything."
The same article continued, "When Mathis came out of the bathroom, she saw what she thought was Phoenix in a scuffle with another man, and the two of them being pushed out of the club’s side door by a bouncer. When she went out on to the street after them, she saw Phoenix drop to the ground and go into convulsions on the pavement."
"Mathis desperately tried to get back into the club to get help, but the side door was firmly shut. So she ran around to the main door, searched through the club for Phoenix’s siblings, and they all dashed outside. Joaquin (River's brother) called 911 for help in a phone call that would almost immediately be leaked to news stations."

The bullet pierced Mr. Lee’s abdomen, damaging several organs and lodging in his spine."
In October of 1993, Brandon's mother, Linda Lee Cadwell settled a negligence lawsuit against filmmakers of The Crow for an undisclosed sum.

What happened:
Tate, along with four others, was murdered by members of the Manson Family cult on Aug. 9, 1969.
On the night of Aug. 8–9, 1969, Sharon Tate, who was eight and a half months pregnant, was killed by members of the Manson Family cult at her Los Angeles home. Under the direction of Charles Manson, four of his followers — Tex Watson, Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel, and Linda Kasabian (who served as a lookout) — broke into Tate’s home and killed her along with four others: Jay Sebring, Abigail Folger, Wojciech Frykowski, and Steven Parent.
The murders were carried out in a frenzy of extreme violence, with the victims being either shot, stabbed (multiple times), or even bludgeoned to death. Tate, who was brutally stabbed and strangled to death, reportedly pleaded for the life of her unborn child before she died.
Atkins, Krenwinkel, and Watson (the three who actually committed the murders) were all sentenced to death. Atkins died in prison in 2009, Krenwinkel was recommended for parole in May 2025, and Watson will be eligible for a parole hearing in October 2026.

What happened:
Sedgwick died at her home on Nov. 16, 1971, of barbiturate intoxication.
Sedgwick was an heiress and best known as an Andy Warhol "superstar" and "it girl" through the mid-1960s. Sedgwick struggled with drug and alcohol addiction and mental health throughout the majority of her life. In fact, she met her future husband, Michael Post, a fellow patient, in the psychiatric wing of a hospital.
According to the Independent, "On 14 November, she went to a fashion show [...] A man she met that evening said she asked to come and see him the next day for a chat, but they would need to have sex first; otherwise, she'd be too nervous to talk. The next morning, her husband woke to find her dead beside him. Whether her death was an accident or suicide, the coroner was unable to determine."
