He died eight years ago, and I still cry getting in and out of the shower."by Conshea BrownBuzzFeed ContributorFacebookPinterestLink
Finding the perfect man who demonstrates daily how important you are is the dream for any (straight) woman in search of love.

So when Reddit user u/Mean-Main-9589 asked the question, "To all the married women, what is that something your husband does that makes you think you won the lottery in the marriage aspect of life?" in r/AskReddit, I was super excited to read all of the wonderfully wholesome stories. Here are a few:
1.
"I love flowers, but I love them outside so they don't die as fast. He landscaped every inch of our property and added planters so I could have as many flowers as I want. He's grown plants from a cutting so I could have them."

2.
"He does a lot more grand gestures, but the most special to me is that he always, always fills my water bottle with icy water just how I like it, right before I get home, so it’s waiting for me."
"We got married before either of us could afford nice jewelry, so I still have my plain silver engagement ring, but every ice cube in that bottle is like a 20-carat VVS diamond to me."—u/blueberryjones
3.
"My husband ruined my favorite sweater by leaving it in the washer overnight (the dyes bled). When he saw how upset I was, he didn't try to invalidate my feelings or get defensive...he just apologized and got me a replacement sweater. I've never had to feel worried that my emotions would make my partner resent me. He just honestly listens and repairs things."

4.
"He does not make any decision without consulting me, even the smallest of things. I have never asked him to do that; it’s just something he does by himself because he sees us as one unit. It always made me want to be a better wife to him."
—u/Used-Minimum7376
5.
"When the kids were babies, my husband used to come home from work, take over care of the kids, and tell me to go out for an hour just for me. I would go to Target or to the mall and just walk around to destress from being at home all day with the kids."

"I didn't know anyone whose husband did that, and I felt really loved knowing he was thinking of me and how stressful my days at home were. That five hours a week to myself really helped keep me sane when the kids were little."—u/StatusButterfly1575
6.
"My husband slept on the floor next to our son's crib for the first 10 months of his life, doing all the night feeds. I was a stay-at-home mom, and he had to get up and go to work every day. I wasn’t healing well physically or mentally from a traumatic birth, but he really showed up for us. I’ll never forget his kindness when I was at my most vulnerable. Both our son and I think he hung the moon."

7.
"He will rub/massage any ache or sore muscle I have, any time of day…and there are no sexual remarks that come with it. I'm currently pregnant for the fourth time, and I have him rubbing my lower back every day — never a complaint. He always seems happy to assist in any kind of relief he can bring to me. I’m so appreciative!"

"I'm in a community theater group and host parties a couple of times a year. He's not involved with the group, but not only does he put up with having a bunch of aging theater kids making a ruckus, he makes a specific effort to conversationally monopolize that one person no one likes, so
the rest of us don't have to talk to them."
—u/Snoo52682
9.
"He is ferociously on my side, no matter what. He makes me laugh until my stomach hurts, but he's also so kind and helpful to those around him. We were at a wedding a few years back, and while walking into the reception area, one of the waiters dropped an entire cart of plates that shattered everywhere."

"Everyone walked right past or just around the guy, not my husband, though. He stopped and helped that man pick up every single plate. He does things like this often, and every time, I am reminded how incredibly lucky I am."—u/HistoricalHeart
10.
"He listens to me and changes his behavior when I tell him something is bothering me. Like, he grew up in a pretty unaffectionate household with no praise. So I had to tell him, 'Hey, I could use a little bit of compliments once in a while,' and it took him a bit to get comfortable doing that, but he put in the effort even when it made him feel awkward."

11.
"He’s grateful. He never expects anything of me and makes me feel appreciated. When I cook dinner, he always says thank you. It seems like the bare minimum, but I speak to my friends, and their husbands expect things of them, 'woman jobs' or whatever. It takes two to run our household; we both have full-time jobs and each carry our weight around the house. But I never feel like he doesn’t appreciate the things I do."

"He cooks, does the dishes, and does the grocery shopping. And the amount he’s helped me postpartum is incredible!! I’ve read stories of men not helping with injuries after birth, and mine helped like it was nothing. He took care of my stitches and cleaned my bloody laundry without batting an eye."
—u/HoppyRaven12

"I can't believe I'm going to tell this story, but here I go. It was one thing my husband did. We lost our dog to cancer about six months before we listed our house for sale. This dog was my soul dog, and I could not bear to leave her at our old house."

"My husband and brother-in-law dug her up (she was buried in a heavy canvas and probably plastic-lined burial bag), placed her in a large tote, put her on a trailer, and drove the hour to our new house. Then they dug a grave in the prettiest spot up on a hill and reburied her. We've been married for 27 years, and he's been an amazing husband and dad, but this was the moment I knew I had really won the husband (and in-law) lottery. I joke around with my daughters that when it comes to husbands, they need to find the man who is willing to dig up their dead dog."—u/BeeBarnes1

"Every time I turned the shower on, he’d immediately go and pop a towel and fresh clothes in the dryer and listen for me to turn the shower off and bring me a warm towel and clothes to change into. He died eight years ago, and I still cry getting in and out of the shower."
—u/Previous-Snow-1030
And finally, here's one that's just the absolute sweetest:
15.
"He treats me as a full human being and equal partner in a culture that increasingly seems not to want to do so. Also, we are in our 50s now, but have known each other since freshman year of high school."

"If something ever happened to him (gods forbid), I would never be able to replicate the sheer amount of shared history and in-jokes that we have with another future partner. This man knows and accepts every part of me, good or bad."—u/Rhamona_Q
