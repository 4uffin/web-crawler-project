The olden days were a dangerous time.

...And sleeping on a bag of water was "in."

Yes, I'm talking about a waterbed.

Any millennial who has seen A Goofy Movie knows what I'm talking about.

Here's the iconic waterbed scene if you forgot.
The first waterbed was invented in 1968 and gained popularity in the '70s. However, they really became a hit in the '80s and early '90s, but quickly became a thing of the past by the time the '00s rolled around (for several reasons, which we will get to in a bit).

Anyway, Gen Z has rediscovered them on TikTok after @ohhelloitsnikki went viral for sharing some wild facts about them. So, sit down and gather 'round for some interesting info about these infamous beds that Nikki shared in her TikTok...
@ohhelloitsnikki / tiktok.com
She begins, "Have you looked at facts about water beds yet today? If you haven't, I have some for you, so that might save you the trouble from googling it. Waterbeds were so popular in the '70s and '80s that out of every five beds sold, one was a waterbed. Each water bed weighed between 1,500 to 2,000 pounds."
@ohhelloitsnikki / tiktok.com
(Note: Some places claim waterbeds can weigh up to 2,100 pounds!!!)
"So, if you're going to have it upstairs, think about it and then think about it again, and then do that, like, 400 times. Because if you have it upstairs and you put all the water in it, you can't just move it. You have to drain all the water out before moving it. Also, are your floors heavy enough for that? I'm going to actually look that up after this to see disasters with water beds, because that sounded riveting."

"Heaters. So, each bed, you could just heat the water in it to make it warmer. That was cool. I didn't know that. The waterbeds could last 10 to 20 years if maintained properly. So, if you put conditioner in the water every six months to keep the water fresh, you can have your bed 10 to 20 years."

Nikki then realized she had a lot of other things to google, but hoped the information was helpful.

Clearly, the TikTok piqued people's interest.
@ohhelloitsnikki / tiktok.com
And it made lots of them go down memory lane.
@ohhelloitsnikki / tiktok.com
The reviews were mixed, with a lot of people disliking the beds.
@ohhelloitsnikki / tiktok.com
And claiming they are just awful to sleep on.
@ohhelloitsnikki / tiktok.com
On the other hand, there were a lot of people who praised them.
@ohhelloitsnikki / tiktok.com
And these people claim waterbeds provided optimal shut-eye.
@ohhelloitsnikki / tiktok.com
In fact, some say they haven't had a good night's sleep since they stopped sleeping on one!
@ohhelloitsnikki / tiktok.com
The reviews seem to be a solid 50/50 split — and yes, some people still own them.
@ohhelloitsnikki / tiktok.com
But, whether people like them or not, everyone admits they were a hazard in more ways than one.
@ohhelloitsnikki / tiktok.com
It seems like engineers were needed before placing them in homes.
@ohhelloitsnikki / tiktok.com
Because waterbeds = anxiety.
@ohhelloitsnikki / tiktok.com
And they were quite maintenance-heavy.
@ohhelloitsnikki / tiktok.com
So, having insurance on them was probably a good idea.
@ohhelloitsnikki / tiktok.com
They were very annoying at times.
@ohhelloitsnikki / tiktok.com
And if the heater broke, you were doomed.
@ohhelloitsnikki / tiktok.com
Silk sheets were also a risk.
@ohhelloitsnikki / tiktok.com
And slapping them was never a good idea.
@ohhelloitsnikki / tiktok.com
People who sleep with their pets likely decided against them...
@ohhelloitsnikki / tiktok.com
However, new parents were encouraged to get one for their babies!!
@ohhelloitsnikki / tiktok.com
As well as their kids. (Again, the olden days were dangerous.)
@ohhelloitsnikki / tiktok.com
All this being said, waterbeds sure were indestructible.
@ohhelloitsnikki / tiktok.com
And people got good use out of them!
@ohhelloitsnikki / tiktok.com
So, if you had (or still have) a waterbed, you gotta let us know in the comments. AND SHARE YOUR AGE IF YOU DARE!!!!
@ohhelloitsnikki / tiktok.com
Waterbeds. What. a. ride.
@ohhelloitsnikki / tiktok.com
You can still buy waterbeds today, but experts generally do not recommend them.
