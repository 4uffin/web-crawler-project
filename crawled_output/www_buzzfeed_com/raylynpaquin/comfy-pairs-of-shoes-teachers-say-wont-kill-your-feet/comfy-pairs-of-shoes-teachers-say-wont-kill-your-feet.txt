Unless otherwise specified, all sizes in this post are listed in women's.
1.
A supportive pair of plain white sneakers aka the ultimate pair-with-anything shoe for rushing around a classroom at top speed minus any sort of foot discomfort or pain.
amazon.com
Promising review: "I'm a teacher, so I spend all day on my feet. I own many, many tennis shoes and sneakers; this pair is by far the easiest to stand in and walk around in all day! The white looks great with everything! I'm actually back for another color because I love them so much!" —hrhkrisGet them from Amazon for $59.99+ (available in sizes 5–13, including wide and extra-wide fits, and in 34 colors).
2.
And a pair of colorblock sneakers for days you're feeling a little extra ~whimsical~ — I'm looking at you, elementary, art, and quirky English teachers.
amazon.com
Promising review: "I’ve been wearing Rocket Dog shoes since high school and they never disappoint! As a teacher, I’m on my feet all day and these are perfect since they are well padded and have great support. They are very flexible and are amazing if you have wider feet. You can’t pass these up especially at this price!" —SSchmitzGet them from Amazon for $23.30+ (available in sizes 6–13 and in 41 colors).
3.
A dual-strap sandal, because it's 2025, and back to school does not mean fall is here. You still need your overtired feet to BREATHE — especially as you're transitioning from your barefoot summer back to Olympic-paced speed-walking to the bathroom during the passing period.
amazon.com
Promising review: "I love these! They have great arch support. I wear them almost every day to work. I'm a teacher and am always on the move and they never cause blisters or make my feet hurt in any way. I wish I had them in every color!" —JordieGet them from Amazon for $34.65+ (available in sizes 5–12 and in 29 colors).
4.
A perfectly dainty Mary Jane if you're looking for a little fun in your outfits. These are one of my school year buys, and I've been breaking them in over the summer to make sure they'll work — I was shocked to not feel any pain or blistering after walking around in them. A masterpiece!
amazon.com
Promising review: "I own three pairs (white, black, brown). I am a teacher and I think they are the perfect teacher flats. Comfortable, affordable, cute. A good wardrobe staple." —Tanya ElaineGet them from Amazon for $19.99+ (available in sizes 5–11, two styles, and nine colors).

A supportive loafer if you need some arch support and a little more foot coverage. Whether you have a school that lets you wear jeans or if you're pairing them with some nice pants — these will keep your feet supported without looking orthopedic.
amazon.com
Promising review: "These shoes are amazing! I have to be careful with what I buy for flats. They MUST have support as I have a very high arch. As a high school teacher, I am on my feet all day! I can wear these all day with a no-show sock and my feet don't hurt at all by the end of the day. They go great with my all my colored pants and even dress up a pair of jeans! I think I need to order the black ones as well!!" —Kristen GarbariniGet them from Amazon for $29.22+ (available in sizes 6–13, including wide fits, and in five colors).
6.

amazon.com

7.
A cutout sandal to pair with skirts, dresses, or pants if you want to look put together without crying from pain at the end of the day. Other types of crying are acceptable.
amazon.com
Promising review: "This shoe is perfect! I am an elementary school teacher and was looking for a nice shoe that would be able to support my feet while standing for 8 hours straight, and this shoe was perfect.

I highly recommend!" —Amazon CustomerGet them from Amazon for $49.34+ (available in sizes 5–12 and in seven colors).
8.
A wedge sandal for your dresses and skirts that'll give you even support with a little lift. This is especially handy if you find yourself in the shadow of high schoolers and could use a few extra inches of pure ~intimidation~.
amazon.com
Promising review: "I LOVE these shoes! I needed something cute, but comfortable and these fit the bill. I’m a teacher averaging 6,000 steps at work and I can wear them all day just fine. I like the way my ankle feels supported, too." —Heather EvansGet them from Amazon for $39.99+ (available in sizes 6–11 and in three colors).

A closed-toe sandal in case you're tired of desks running into your toes or kids stepping on you, but don't want to give up your precious sandals while the weather is still warm. Closed toes = problem solved.
amazon.com
Promising review: "I loved the easy velcro strap, comfort, and versatility. I can wear this shoe with anything. I am a teacher, and walk about 8K steps a day, at minimum. This shoe has been my easy go to. I'm fact, I'm getting ready to buy a second pair. My only wish is that it was available in more colors like red. It's a must buy!!" —Eloina TrujilloGet them from Amazon for $32.49+ (available in sizes 5.5–11 and in six colors).
10.
A memory foam loafer to get that business look while still getting some serious mileage every day. I bought these ones for the upcoming school year, and they feel like little pillows on my feet — who'd have thunk I'm actually excited to pair these with everything?

A super fun mule that gives too-cool art teacher vibes even if you're looking out from your math class. We should all be able to be a little fun, darn it!

A ballet flat — your basic go-to shoe that goes with literally anything. These ones level up with some arch support so your poor arches, knees, and back aren't screaming like a first grader at recess.
amazon.com
Promising review: "Absolutely love these!!! I’m a teacher and usually spend a lot of time on my feet. I have health issues and am extremely picky about my shoes. These are sooo comfy!

I can’t say enough positive things, you’ll just have to try them." —MGGet them from Amazon for $29.99+ (available in sizes 5–12, including narrow, wide, and extra wide fits, and in 13 colors).
13.
A neutral block heel for when you want — or need — to wear heels but you haven't put on actual heels since remote teaching of 2020. (🙋‍♀️) If you miss heels but can't commit to tiny pumps, these babies are the perfect compromise.
amazon.com
Promising review: "I am a teacher and these are lightweight and comfortable for me all day. I wish I would’ve discovered them years ago. I appreciate the sole for zipping around the hallways. Highly recommend!" —lewis1998Get them from Amazon for $36.99+ (available in sizes 5–11 and in five colors).
14.
A supportive platform mule because sometimes you just want a shoe you can secretly kick off when you're working at your desk. I see you. I AM you.
amazon.com, amazon.com
Promising review: "I love these shoes. I am a special education teacher which means I’m on my feet ALL day. Before I started wearing these, I had to choose cute shoes that HURT or ugly shoes that don’t make my feet hurt AS bad. Because I am a 26 year old, I let myself wear the cute shoes and suffer more than I’d like to admit. These shoes have quickly become my most worn because they are cute AND I have NO pain when I get home. Before I would get home and stay on my feet until I was ready to rest for the evening because of how much it hurt to get moving again. Not to mention the dreaded first few steps out of bed in the morning. Thanks to these shoes, I’m styling(lol) and foot pain free!!" —Melanie BrownGet them from Amazon for $79.99 (available in sizes 5–12 and in 11 colors).
15.
A slip-on sneaker to give your dogs plenty of support, even when your students are acting like feral animals all on their own. I love these shoes because they're so comfy and stay on. I've worn them all over theme parks, which means if you're a SPED teacher with an eloper you're ready to go.
amazon.com
Promising review: "These shoes are a perfect basic! I use them for work, and as a teacher I'm on my feet a lot. Even wearing them the first time, they were extremely comfortable. The back of the shoes don't give me blisters like new shoes usually do. I love that on the outside it's this soft leather material, so whenever they get dirty I can very easily wipe them down. I use them most days and again, so comfortable and very basic that they work with many outfits. I definitely recommend if you need an everyday shoe!" —xo.Get them from Amazon for $22.30+ (available in sizes 5–13, including wide fits, and 23 colors).
16.
A sling-back clog in case you love the clogs look, but your feet don't love dragging a heavy shoe for hours and hours. Clogs are excellent for changing up your look and if they can work, they SHOULD.
amazon.com
Promising review: "I have debilitating ankle pain that impacts how I walk. As a science teacher, I need to be on my feet all day and able to walk about the room continuously. These shoes are light so lifting my foot does not cause pain and planting my foot on the hard surface of the floor is padded nicely by these shoes. Hands down the best sho I’ve EVER worn. I have funky feet too and these shoes are easily the best I’ve found for both my foot and ankle. No orthotics needed." —Amazon CustomerGet them from Amazon for $70.32+ (available in sizes 5.5–12 and in 11 colors).
17.
An ankle boot with a block heel so you can have the heels look without having to actually balancing on a heel the size of a tiny stick all day. You're going to feel fierce and unstoppable in these babies.
amazon.com

18.
A cutout bootie for a full coverage shoe that goes with anything you want to wear. Whether you're making jeans look a little more professional or jazzing up your old reliable pair of business pants — these little cutouts will have you feeling like Miranda Priestly even if some days you feel more like Ms. Trunchbull.

A wedge boot to give you that perfect ankle boot look with full foot support. Whoever came up with wedges had to have been a teacher — coverage, support, and movement.
amazon.com

I am a preschool teacher and have been wearing them to run around with the kids and they're been great — even on my mulch filled playground.
