Recently, BuzzFeed Community members shared the major secrets they're keeping from their family, and they range from devastating to super spicy. Here are some confessions that might leave your jaw hanging from shock:
1.
"My body count is close to 100. My husband thinks it's almost 20. Another secret I have is that I had a sugar daddy for a while, and he was married. No one knew."

"I'm bisexual. Only my straight best friend knows. But what she doesn't know is that I am also in love with her. I know this would never, ever be a possibility for something to happen with her, but I find myself getting jealous, feeling sad when she isn't around, and constantly wondering about her."
—Anonymous
3.
"I'm a 42-year-old married mother, and I'm head over heels in love with a 29-year-old guy that I used a hall pass on years ago. I want to leave my husband for him and really be together."
—Anonymous
4.
"I was in school when I got pregnant with my child. Two months prior, I stopped my birth control because I began having adverse reactions. I am now convinced it was due to the stress my boyfriend had put on me, because I had not had any problems before him. Anyway, I was considering an abortion because I wasn't financially ready, and I wasn't out of school yet. My then verbally abusive boyfriend found out about what I wanted to do, and he said that he wanted to be a father and that we would be alright. I felt incredible guilt; we got together a year after my father passed, and I was still grieving and vulnerable."

"Well, after the baby arrived, the abuse escalated in all forms. I got pregnant two more times after the first, and I secretly had two abortions because I became an abused single mother living in a two-parent home. Only three people close to me know, and two of them helped me pay for the procedures. I don't regret a thing."—Anonymous
5.
"Since I turned 18 (I'm now 21), I'd disappear at night and hook up with resort workers every time we went on family vacation. They were often closer to my parents' ages than mine."
—Anonymous
6.
"I'm bisexual and have kissed and dated more women than men. Most of my family is very conservative and religious (they're Mormon), and I've gotten into arguments with my parents over LGBTQ+ issues many times before. My dad has even said that he won't attend a same-sex wedding. I've conceded that I will just never tell them I'm not entirely straight, and if I do end up marrying a man, they probably won't know until I post wedding photos."
—M., 24, Arizona
7.
"My best friend, my now ex-wife, and I used to get together and have threesomes. We had a great time and tried some interesting things. We made a couple of videos but never posted anything online. I eventually destroyed the videos because we were afraid of someone accidentally finding them. Then, we all agreed that we should stop before anything else happened. It was fun while it lasted, and I still think about it from time to time."
—Anonymous

"I've been cheating on my husband with his dad for a year now. I feel so guilty, but we just can't stop."

"So, my husband and I have been swingers for 12 years, and I've picked up some random strangers on my own. We've spent tons of time in adult theaters, where I have anonymous sex with people. We were both raised in strong, Christian families, and my parents would DIE if they knew."
—Anonymous
10.
"Almost 20 years ago, my first husband manipulated me into having live cams in our house 24/7 so that he could start a website for members to watch us. It lasted six months before I had the courage to leave him. He was what used to be called a 'smutmaster.' He managed the websites, and I edited the videos. He did horrible things to me on those cameras, which were completely illegal and immoral, including sexually assaulting me with a weapon. Anything the viewers wanted, he would do, no matter how depraved. I now have a restraining order against him and have changed my name. My current husband and my best friend know about this, but no one else."

"My husband cheated on me with a sex worker while on a work trip when I was eight months pregnant with our first child. He confessed to me after he got concerned he'd gotten herpes, which caused me to go into labor. Our kiddo was born just over 26 hours later. He worked on himself, and we stayed together. My dad would never forgive my husband if he knew."
—Anonymous

"My family will never know this, but I'm happy my uncle died. I've been unpacking this in therapy, but I feel like he is the reason why I can't remember anything from when I was 6 to 10 years old. I always got the creeps from him, and I'm glad he's gone."

"I'm single and in my mid-30s. Because of that, I'm pretty sure that most of my family members think I'm either weird or a lost cause, but I might be on the Aroace spectrum (aromantic and asexual). I still haven't found a name that suits me, but all I know is that I don't think I want romance or sex — ever. Ever since I was a teenager, neither of those things has appealed to me for a wide variety of reasons. I have nothing to gain by explaining this to my family, though. My sister and most of my cousins are either married or engaged, so it really shouldn't matter whether my relationship status changes at all."
—Anonymous

"I slept with my sister's husband. My husband was incarcerated, so when my sister's husband showed up at my door in the middle of the night, I let him in, and we had sex. He came back about a month later, expecting to have sex again. I answered the door but didn't let him in, as I was afraid someone would see his truck at my place. My sister will never find out."
—Anonymous
15.
"I'm not good at dating. Something about emotional intimacy to me is a real turn-off, but I do crave physical affection and touch. Because of that, I go to sex parties. They're fun, and the people there are really respectful. I get my craving for physical intimacy fulfilled in a perfectly fun, no-strings-attached way. I know if I told anybody that there would be some judgment, but I definitely know that if I told my family, they'd have a freakin' cow."
—A., 34, Texas

Lastly: "I'm a gay man and have been all my life. My family is well aware of it, but when I was 26 and living on my own, I had an affair with an older man who was married and went to our family church. He would call me weekly to come over to have sex and talk. He always left $200–300 on my nightstand, even though I told him it wasn't necessary. He would buy me extravagant gifts as well. He often worked out of town, so when he knew he was leaving, he'd make arrangements for me to go to the same town and stay with him. His wife and children never found out, and neither have my family. Twenty years later, we are still 'together,' and he has made a will to leave me something nice. Now, I am stressed about how to explain why he left me money! He tells me not to worry about it because nobody has to know except the executor and us."
