A Reddit user from the r/amithejerk subreddit recently went viral for sharing his predicament involving his sister, who is getting married, and his wife, who is NOT invited to the wedding.

Here's the full story: "I (30, male) have been married to my wife (29, female) for 3 years, together for 10. We’ve had a great relationship overall."
"A couple years ago, my wife’s best friend was getting married and my wife was the maid of honor. The issue was that one of the bridesmaids was my college ex. Our breakup had been messy, and the bridesmaid didn’t want me at the wedding. When I found out I wasn’t invited to the wedding because of that, I was really hurt."
"My wife did ask me if she could still go since it was her best friend’s wedding, and I said yes because it was her best friend."
"It was a destination wedding over a weekend. I felt pretty down while she was gone, and when she came back, she saw I was still feeling down and apologized to me. I told her it was ok. A few months later, even the bride apologized to me, and I said it was fine."
"It’s been 2 years since, and my sister is getting married in a few months. She’s my ride or die, we’re really close and she asked me to be her man of honor. She also wants me to walk her down the aisle and do the father daughter dance with her since our dad passed away. So I’ve got a lot of important responsibilities."

"But my sister told me she doesn’t want my wife at her wedding. She said the wedding would be ruined if my wife came. I was really surprised and sort of shocked when she told me that."
"My wife and my sister are actually close, but when my wife talked to her, my sister said she still likes her, but this is a lesson my wife has to learn for attending that wedding I wasn’t invited to two years ago."
"My wife is really sad and I don’t feel great about it. But this is my sister’s big day, and I want to be there for her 100%. What should I do? I really want to attend the wedding."
"Yes, You would be the jerk. Your sister has no place 'teaching [your wife] a lesson,' period. If you want to be petty and leave your wife out because of the wedding you weren’t invited to, yes, you would be the jerk," user Busy-Bumblebee5556 said.
"You and your wife have either resolved this issue, in which case there is no issue, or you’re still seething with resentment over it, in which case you should divorce your wife. Your sister is not your ruler, she’s not your boss, she’s not your mother. Your sister needs to butt out of your marriage."
"Who the fuck would let their sister do this to their wife? Tell your sister her revenge plan is petty AF. Your wife deserves better than you if you attend the wedding," user Dramatic_Wealth8638 wrote.

"This is something your sister needs to stay out of. I would suggest explaining to your sister that what happened was regrettable, but it is in the past, and her even making this suggestion has reopened some old wounds," user Prechrchet wrote.
"I would also suggest that either both of you attend, or neither of you attend. Your spouse should come before anyone and everyone else, period."
