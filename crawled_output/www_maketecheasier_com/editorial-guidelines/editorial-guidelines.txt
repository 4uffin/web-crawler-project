Our Mission
We, at Make Tech Easier, pride ourselves on being a reputable and independent tech media outlet that provides tested, accurate tutorials and reviews. Our mission is simple: uncomplicating the complicated, making life easier.
Editorial Independence
Since 2007, we have been recognized for maintaining full independence of our publication. To continue to maintain our independence and uphold trust, MTE’s staff and contributors cannot accept compensation of any kind in exchange for a review, news coverage, or inclusion in an article or video.
Transparency
All content that is paid for by an advertiser is considered sponsored or branded and will be marked as such in the content. Make Tech Easier may receive compensation for commerce content through sales via affiliate links. It will be marked as a âDeal.â
Content Accuracy: Corrections, Updates, and Feedback
Our goal is to provide fully-tested and accurate content in our publication. While errors are unavoidable from time to time, we aim to correct them as soon as possible.
Readers who believe they have found an error or mistake in our content are encouraged to contact the Editorial team directly via our contact form. The team will follow up with the feedback and update our content as necessary.
Product Reviews: How We Perform Testing
All reviews and buying guides are based on thorough research and testing. See our review standards for more details.
Plagiarism
Plagiarism, or blatant copying of content from another source/article, is not allowed under any circumstance in Make Tech Easier.
We allow our staff and contributors to use AI tools for research purposes, but use of AI tools to generate a considerable portion of an article is not permitted.
We make considerable effort to validate our content on Make Tech Easier. Any staff or contributor found violating the rules is banned from writing for MTE, and their content is removed from the site.
Paid Content
All content that is paid for by an advertiser is considered sponsored or branded, and will be marked as such in the content. Listed below are the various types of paid content service that we provide:
Sponsored Reviews
A sponsored review is when a company pays for a review of their product. While the company will provide the product for review, and propose the coverage of certain features, it cannot influence the content itself or interfere with its editorial integrity, which should continue to represent the needs of our audience.
When content is sponsored, a disclaimer will be present in the brand as such:
This is a sponsored article and was made possible by Brand name. The actual contents and opinions are the sole views of the author, who maintains editorial independence even when a post is sponsored.
Branded Content
Branded content is commissioned articles meant to promote products, services, or a brand. Branded content is produced independently of our Editorial team and will not be checked for accuracy.
Branded content will be marked with a “Branded content” badge alongside the advertiser’s logo. The authorship of the article will be accredited to the brand, and there will be no author byline.
Sponsored Deals
The Deals team will often source for great products that are going on sale and share it to the site. Such content is labeled as a “Deal” and clearly marked with the following disclaimer: “Make Tech Easier may earn commission on products purchased through our links, which supports the work we do for our readers.“
A sponsored Deal is a product that a company wants to promote that has a deal or discount being offered to our audience or the general public as a whole. This often happens during special events like Amazon Prime Day or Black Friday. A sponsored Deal has the same label as a standard Deal, but with a sponsored tag. The authorship of the article will be accredited to the brand, and there will be no author byline.
