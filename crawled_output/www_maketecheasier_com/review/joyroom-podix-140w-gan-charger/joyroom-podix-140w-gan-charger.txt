Get JOYROOM PODIX 140W GaN Charger
It can be difficult to carry all your chargers for all your devices, let alone find an available electrical outlet. That goes for whether you’re at home, the office, or traveling. But the JOYROOM PODIX 140W GaN Charger allows you to charge them all – up to five at a time, regardless of the charging power they require – quickly.

The Little Charger That Could
The JOYROOM PODIX 140W GaN Charger is a dream charger. In other words, it has every feature you would want in a charger. It will charge many devices at once and is smart enough to charge the right way. The PODIX:
Charges up to five devices at the same time – you only need one electrical outlet, and it is easily shared with another person.
Employs 140W smart fast charging – it will provide up to 140W, distributed among all your devices, intelligently distributing the right amount of power to each device.
Includes two 31.5” retractable USB-C cables – no more fumbling around for a cord. Charge all your USB-C devices with just the one charger.
180º rotation and tri-magnetic grip – the magnetic base holds the charger in place and allows you to rotate it in any direction to suit your needs.
Animated emoji display – watch the expressions on the face on the display to check on your charging.
Built-in safety features – built-in NTC sensor tracks tempurature and automatically adjusts to keep it from overheating. It also has protections from overcurrent, overvoltage, short circuits, and more.
The PODIX has been engineered to withstand four separate stress tests, including drop tests, cable strength, and display endurance. It will stay cool under pressure, thanks to a smart chip that prevents overheating. GaN technology ensures fast, stable power with minimal energy loss.
Unboxing the JOYROOM PODIX Charger
Like most chargers, there aren’t many pieces or much assembly to the JOYROOM PODIX GaN Charger. Included in the box is:
GaN charger
Power cord
Anti-slip rubber pad
Instruction manual
That’s it. But there’s much more packed into the charger than you would think. It does so much and provides so many possibilities.
Charges Multiple Devices
We are all looking for one charger that will do it all. The JOYROOM PODIX 140W Charger does. Short of being a hub, it really does a lot.
Within this one charger, there are five charging options. While again, you can turn the charger around like a Rubik’s Cube, on the “front,” there are two USB-A ports and one USB-C port. On the “top,” there are two retractable 31.5” USB-C cords.
In addition to the five charging options, the charger can handle up to 140W of power. It’s definitely all the power I need to charge my iPad Pro, portable charger, Apple Watch, and iPhone all at once. I still have charging power and another USB-A port to spare.
A screen shows the output of individual ports. It shows what output is being used at each of the five ports, as well as the total output of what is being used. I had four devices charging: iPhone, iPad Pro, Apple Watch, and a portable charger, and I was still only using 67 watts of the possible 140.
Emoji Symbols Status
The JOYROOM PODIX Charger also has delightful animated emojis to enhance the charging experience. There are three screens on the digital 1.54” display. The animated emoji status screen, the total output, and the individual port output.
The emojis include a windmill, Zzz, bubble effect, and more. These don’t mean anything in particular. Some show regardless of charging status, while some appear during standby. The individual port output screen always shows the same emoji. It has a shield on it to show charging protection.
Travel Possibilities
The JOYROOM PODIX Charger is not meant for on the go. However, it can be a great thing for travel, as you don’t need anything else. If you have two devices that charge via USB-C. It’s all you need, thanks to the retractable cords. If you have three, you just need one cord. If you have something that charges via USB-A or a special cord, you need that cord.
For instance, I needed my cord for my Apple Watch. And my iPad Pro, iPhone 16, and portable charger all charge via USB-C. When I traveled recently with it, I only needed my watch cord and one USB-C to USB-C cord. That was it.
However, it’s a little on the heavy side at just over a pound, and it’s a somewhat large square brick at 2.96 x 3.24 x 3.0 inches. That makes it kind of inconvenient for travel. However, I did easily throw it in my bag. I had the room, and it only made it a little heavier.
I suppose for all it does, I’d rather have those abilities than be more travel-friendly. To charge all of my devices and do it quickly, I’ll take that over it being a little bulky and weighty. Besides, while my husband always carries his own charger with him, he wouldn’t have to. He could use the same charger, as I’m usually not charging all my devices when I’m traveling.
Final Thoughts
The JOYROOM PODIX 140W Charger is definitely my new favorite – in fact, it’s the only one I’m using. It has replaced and surpassed all the others I use and have used.
The fact that it can charge five devices at once is fabulous. The only other charging apparatus I have that does that is my power station. While the PODIX isn’t the most travel-friendly, it’s certainly more so than a huge power station. I’m likely to call the PODIX a game-changer.
Plus, the animated emoji screen keeps things fun and interesting. However, it would be nice if the emojis showed charging status. A little celebrative emoji when everything was finished charging would be helpful.
Lastly, I do wish things were explained a little more in the user manual. Instead of just showing images of the different animated emoji screens and explaining when you would see each one, it just showed the images.
If you want the simplicity of only one charger in your life, you can pick up the PODIX on Kickstarter for just $79 to $99.
