Why Learn SQL?SQL (Structured Query Language) is the standard language for storing, retrieving, and managing data in relational databases. Itâs a critical skill in data analysis, business intelligence, and software development. Learning SQL helps you work efficiently with data, uncover insights, and support decision-making across industries.Skills you can learn in Data AnalysisAnalytics (85)Big Data (64)Python Programming (47)Business Analytics (40)R Programming (37)Statistical Analysis (36)Data Model (29)Data Mining (27)Exploratory Data Analysis (26)Data Modeling (21)Data Manipulation (20)Show MoreFrequently Asked Questions about SqlChevron RightHow do I choose the right SQL course for my goals?âStart by identifying your use caseâdo you want to analyze data, work with databases, or support a technical role in data science or engineering?For practical data querying skills, consider SQL: A Practical Introduction for Querying Databases, which includes SQL for data analysis.For a focused SQL foundation, try SQL for Data Science by UC Davis.If you're preparing for technical interviews or backend roles, consider Meta Database Engineer Professional Certificate, which includes advanced SQL topics and database management.âChevron RightWhich SQL course should I start with as a beginner?âThese beginner-friendly options offer an approachable introduction to SQL, no prior experience required:SQL for Data Science by UC Davis â A top-rated intro that teaches the basics of querying and joins.Intro to SQL from Scrimba â Focuses on writing queries and filtering data with hands-on practice.Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python by IBM â Great if youâre learning SQL as part of a broader data science skill set.
âChevron RightWhatâs the difference between an SQL course, Specialization, and Professional Certificate?âA course focuses on one key skillâsuch as Managing Big Data with MySQL.A Specialization helps you build a broader SQL and database toolkitâlike the Learn SQL Basics for Data Science Specialization.A Professional Certificate prepares you for career roles (e.g., analyst or engineer) with end-to-end trainingâsuch as Meta Database Engineer Certificate or IBM Data Analyst Certificate, both of which include SQL.
