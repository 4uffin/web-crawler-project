I have the following scenario:
class AId {
String aId1;
String aId2;
}
@IdClass{AId.class}
class A {
@Id String aId1;
@Id String aId2;
String aType;
// possible values are 0,1
}
@IdClass{BId.class}
class B {
@Id String bId1;
@Id String bId2;
String bType; // possible values are 0,1,2
@ManyToOne (fetchType="EAGER")
@JoinColumn(name = bId1, referenceColumn = aId1)
@JoinColumn(name = bType, referenceColumn = aType)
A aOfB;
// B will have an A only if bType <> 2
}
So if B={01,02,1}, I want to perform the join with table A to obtain A={01,03,1}
But, if B={01,02,2} since bType is 2, I know that it won't have an A element and I don't want to join when I fetch B. I am just unsure what the correct syntax is to achieve this.
Do I use @JoinFormula? But the examples that I've seen using @JoinFormula only relies on single column joins whereas in my case I need 2.

I am not sure what is the goal here - do you want to omit JOIN in SQL query entirely? Or you aiming to achieve any special JOIN condition? I could augment the query by using JoinColumnOrFormula and JoinColumnsOrFormulas
