This pertains to Emily's answer here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/13850560/2026752
ansMap :: M.Map Integer Int
ansMap = M.fromAscList [(i, collatz i) | i <- [1..1000000]]
where collatz 1 = 0
collatz x = if x' <= 1000000 then 1 + ansMap M.! x'
else 1 + collatz x'
where x' = if even x then x `div` 2 else x*3 + 1
-- this code is really fast
fst $ maximumBy (comparing snd) $ M.toList ansMap
This seemed like a reasonable strategy, so I decided to take 1000000 and feed it as a variable to the function, so I could compute the Collatz sequence for even more numbers:
ansMap :: Integer -> M.Map Integer Int
ansMap n = M.fromAscList [(i, collatz i) | i <- [1..n]]
where collatz 1 = 0
collatz x = if x' <= n then 1 + ansMap n M.! x'
else 1 + collatz x'
where x' = if even x then x `div` 2 else x*3 + 1
-- but then suddenly this is slow
fst $ maximumBy (comparing snd) $ M.toList ansMap 1000000
This confuses me, since all I did was take n out and pass it back in! I don't know much about the Haskell runtime. Please help me understand! Thank you in advance.

In Emily's answer, ansMap is a M.Map Integer Int which is recursively defined in terms of itself. In your modified code, ansMap is a function, and ansMap n returns a M.Map Integer Int that is recursively defined in terms of other calls to ansMap. But those recursive calls to ansMap themselves construct and return a (distinct) M.Map Integer Int, which ends up making tons of different M.Map Integer Ints until the recursion bottoms out.
You can fix this simply by making it so that there is once again a M.Map Integer Int that is recursively defined in terms of itself, rather than having a recursively defined function.
ansMap :: Integer -> M.Map Integer Int
ansMap n = mapping
where mapping = M.fromAscList [(i, collatz i) | i <- [1..n]]
collatz 1 = 0
collatz x = if x' <= n then 1 + mapping M.! x'
else 1 + collatz x'
where x' = if even x then x `div` 2 else x*3 + 1
Note that collatz uses mapping, and does not make a recursive call to ansMap -- so ansMap is not recursively defined (though mapping is).
That was an asymptotic speedup; there are also constant-factor speedups available. For example, switching Integer to Int, switching Map to Vector, and doing bit-twiddly operations in the definition of x' makes it about an order of magnitude faster. If switching to Int makes you nervous, staying with Integer is only about 50% slower.
ansMap :: Int -> V.Vector Int
ansMap n = mapping
where mapping = V.generate (n+1) collatz
collatz 0 = -1
collatz 1 = 0
collatz x = if x' <= n then 1 + mapping V.! x'
else 1 + collatz x'
where x' = if x .&. 1 == 0 then shiftR x 1 else x*3 + 1
V.maxIndex $ ansMap 1000000

quick q -- how did you develop an eye for recognizing where to 'pull out' the recursion?

@daikonradish Your question is probably too specific. As asked, the answer is "there's only one place to look" -- namely, at function definitions -- so it doesn't take long to "develop an eye". You only need two or three examples to see the pattern. But more generally, there's a broad class of things I watch for and code smells I've picked up. Unfortunately there's no single answer for how; I've aggregated tricks by answering questions (and reading others' answers) here and on the #haskell IRC channel and by many happy hours spent making, finding, and fixing mistakes in my own Haskell programs
