Image source, PA MediaBritish boxing broadcasters Steve Bunce and Mike Costello once told me a story about the magnetism of Hatton. In the sprawling corridors of a Las Vegas hotel, the pair were on air, discussing Hattonâs imminent fight while British punters lined up to gain entry into the weigh-in. The weigh-in, on this occasion, was the next day.Thatâs how much pull the Mancunian generated, overnight queues were necessary.Bunce and Costello approched punters in the queue, live, on air, and asked them if they had a personal Hatton story. Fan after fan told the 5 Live audience of how they were linked to Hatton. A friend, a relative, drank at the same spot, grew up in the same road. They all shared one thing - connection.That one word encapsulates âThe Hitmanâ. No British fighter since - not Anthony Joshua, Tyson Fury or Amir Khan - has come remotely close to creating what Hatton did in the US. The boy from the Hattersley Council estate was flanked by his own travelling army and every current and future British fighter who laces up gloves will dream about having what he had.His career was remarkable. From insane weight cuts to the calibre of legendary opponents it took to stop his momentum. And yet it is that connection that will endure. It was not uncommon to be around Mexican and US boxing stars who would end chats or an interview with, âSay hello to my good friend Ricky Hattonâ.
They knew what he represented, theyâd stood and admired his pull, they wanted in on the love.There will indeed only ever be one Ricky Hatton. He carried fans - all of whom felt they knew him - to a wonderland they will never forget.

Image source, Getty ImagesSpeaking to the BBC in 2022, Ricky Hatton discussed his struggles with his mental health over the years. The boxer was defeated by Floyd Mayweather in 2007, and Manny Pacquiao in 2009. Those defeats left him deeply depressed and led to the darkest times of his life.After his knockout in 2009 he knew his career was over, despite a short-lived comeback in 2012."I had no boxing. My career was over. I'd fallen out with my parents. I'd fallen out with my trainer Billy Graham. That's when it got to rock bottom," he said. "I just went out on the warpath. It was horrible for people to see."He described these feelings three years ago, when he was preparing for an exhibition fight with an old rival turned good friend - former three-weight world champion Marco Antonio Barrera, at the AO Arena in Manchester.Eight months beforehand, Hatton was 15st 4lbs, drinking every weekend, indulging in too many takeaways and neglecting his health.He told the BBC he was "massively obese", but getting back in the ring was a "very easy decision". "The whole purpose was to set myself a goal for this exhibition, to get in shape and inspire so many people."In the end, Hatton said he got âeverything and more" after the fight.
