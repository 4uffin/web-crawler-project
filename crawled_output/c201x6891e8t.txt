Image source, Getty ImagesSpeaking to the BBC in 2022, Ricky Hatton discussed his struggles with his mental health over the years. The boxer was defeated by Floyd Mayweather in 2007, and Manny Pacquiao in 2009. Those defeats left him deeply depressed and led to the darkest times of his life.After his knockout in 2009 he knew his career was over, despite a short-lived comeback in 2012."I had no boxing. My career was over. I'd fallen out with my parents. I'd fallen out with my trainer Billy Graham. That's when it got to rock bottom," he said. "I just went out on the warpath. It was horrible for people to see."He described these feelings three years ago, when he was preparing for an exhibition fight with an old rival turned good friend - former three-weight world champion Marco Antonio Barrera, at the AO Arena in Manchester.Eight months beforehand, Hatton was 15st 4lbs, drinking every weekend, indulging in too many takeaways and neglecting his health.He told the BBC he was "massively obese", but getting back in the ring was a "very easy decision". "The whole purpose was to set myself a goal for this exhibition, to get in shape and inspire so many people."In the end, Hatton said he got âeverything and more" after the fight.
