In my conversation with Robert Dippell, CEO of Morning Brew, I wasn't looking for a polished pitch or a viral soundbite â€” I was looking to understand how someone leads a media company in 2025 without getting swallowed by noise, distraction and industry clichÃ©. What I got was a grounded perspective from someone who seems far more interested in building responsibly than chasing attention.Morning Brew's rise is well-documented â€” what started as a college project and a newsletter has turned into podcasts, daily shows, video series and events. Dippell, formerly their COO and CRO, took over as CEO in early 2025. He didn't pretend that leading a media company today is easy. Ad models are unstable, audiences are fragmented, and the pressure to grow is constant. But he wasn't cynical either. The core idea seemed to be that if you're honest about who you are as a company â€” and you empower your team â€” you can still produce valuable content without selling out or burning out.Related: Lessons from Macmillan's CEO on Leading Through Change Without Losing Your WhyWe talked a lot about media fatigue, from clickbait overload to algorithm-choked social feeds, and how younger professionals are demanding more from their content and the companies that produce it. Not necessarily more volume, but more clarity and personality. Morning Brew, according to Dippell, is trying to meet that moment with a voice that feels like a smart coworker, not a corporate PR blast.Dippell didn't carry himself like someone trying to reinvent the wheel, and that came through in how he talked about his role: not to overhaul, not to hype, but to stay focused on what works and guide a team that already understands its audience well. One theme that stuck out: You can't just chase scale. Dippell described the trap of media businesses growing for the sake of growing, without clear monetization or audience loyalty. Instead, he's focused on sustainable business models that prioritize direct relationships over anonymous traffic. It's less glamorous, but more durable.

There was no ego in how he described his team or Morning Brew's strategy. That restraint, in a media landscape full of founders-as-personalities, was refreshing. If you're leading any kind of business in 2025, there's something to take away from that mindset. In an era of constant noise and hype, maybe clarity, consistency and humility go further than we think.
