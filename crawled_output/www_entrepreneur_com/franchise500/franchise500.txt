Understanding the Ranking
The very first Franchise 500 ranking was published in 1980. Over the four-and-a-half
decades since then, the franchise industry has seen a lot of changes, including trends
that have come and gone (and sometimes come again!) and new regulations. But
through it all, the franchise model has remained resilient. It continues to be an
increasingly attractive avenue for people interested in starting and running their own
business.
If youâ€™re one of them, this list can be a valuable tool to learn about the opportunities that
are available. Youâ€™ll find companies that started franchising before the Franchise 500
existed and have stood the test of timeâ€”as well as emerging brands that only started
franchising in the past few years. Youâ€™ll find tried-and-true concepts, as well as some of
the newest trends, from autism treatment services to self-pour bars. Above all, youâ€™ll
find a wealth of information on brands that want to make you the boss.
Thereâ€™s one more thing that hasnâ€™t changed since 1980, and thatâ€™s the goal of this listâ€”
to recognize the franchise companies that are doing it best. But how do we determine
which ones those are? Read on to find out.

How We Build The List
Our ranking process begins by gathering the data. Starting in June 2024, we asked
franchisors to fill out our extensive online form and submit a copy of their current
Franchise Disclosure Document (FDD) or Canadian Disclosure Document. An
impressive 1,366 companies supplied all the required information this year. Each
submission was vetted by our editorial team before being entered for data analysis.
To be eligible to rank, a franchisor must be seeking new franchisees in the U.S. or
Canada and must have had a minimum of 10 units open and operating as of July 31,
2024, with at least one franchise located in North America. Each eligible franchisor was
scored based on more than 150 data points, and those with the highest cumulative
scores became this yearâ€™s Franchise 500.
Note: The Franchise 500 is not intended to endorse, advertise, or recommend any
particular franchise. It is solely a tool to compare franchise operations. You should
always conduct your own careful research before investing in a franchise. Read the
FDD and related materials, get help from a franchise attorney and an accountant to
review legal and financial documents, talk to as many existing and former franchisees
as possible, and visit their outlets. Protect yourself by doing your homework to find the
opportunity thatâ€™s best for you.
Research compiled by Tracy Stapp Herold, Jordan Hall, and Michael Frazier, with
assistance from Sean Strain, Emma Bennett, Elina Natarajan, and Karl Wang; technical
assistance from Michael Flach and Angel Cool.
