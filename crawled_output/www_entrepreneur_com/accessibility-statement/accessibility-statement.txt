Entrepreneur Media LLC Digital Accessibility Statement
Our Policy & Commitment
At Entrepreneur, we are committed to accessibility, diversity and inclusion. As part of that commitment, we are making efforts to ensure that Entrepreneurâ€™s digital properties are accessible to all individuals, regardless of ability. In doing so, Entrepreneur has a goal to comply with applicable accessibility standards included in the W3Câ€™s WCAG 2.1 Level AA guidelines.
Digital Accessibility Statement
We are working to ensure our websites and online services are accessible for all and are committed to following the W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines and other applicable accessibility laws.
To accomplish this, we have partnered with Level Access to leverage their technology platform and 25 years of experience to achieve and sustain conformance to accessibility standards.
Their accessibility technology platform is used to evaluate our digital properties in accordance with best practices and is supported by a diverse team of accessibility professionals, including users with disabilities. The platform, moreover, goes beyond minimum compliance requirements by making anâ€¯assistive CX technology applicationâ€¯available to customers who have trouble typing, gesturing, moving a mouse, or reading. The application is free to download, and it incorporates tools such as mouse and keyboard replacements, voice recognition, speech enablement, hands-free/touch-free navigation, and more.
Through this partnership, Entrepreneur continues to develop our digital accessibility program and capabilities so that we are designing, developing and testing our websites and online services for conformance to accessibility standards.
