A very common pattern when the service you're talking to might ask for credentials is that we have to implement a callback which the library will call on demand.
The most common examples which come to mind:
java.net.Authenticator
javax.security.auth.callback.CallbackHandler
In this particular case, the one I am looking at is jakarta.mail.Authenticator, where we have to override getPasswordAuthentication() and return a jakarta.mail.PasswordAuthentication. This is almost identical to what java.net's callback looks like.
I can make a state object fairly easily...
class AuthenticatorState {
var request by mutableStateOf(null as AuthenticatorRequest?)
var username by mutableStateOf(null as String?)
var password by mutableStateOf(null as CharArray?)
}
The idea would be to show an auth dialog if request != null. The request object contains all the info about the requester:
data class AuthenticatorRequest(
val requestingSite: InetAddress,
val requestingPort: Int,
val requestingProtocol: String,
val requestingPrompt: String,
val defaultUserName: String,
)
We can then populate this when the authenticator is asked for password:
class AuthenticatorStateAdapter(private val state: AuthenticatorState) : Authenticator() {
override fun getPasswordAuthentication(): PasswordAuthentication? {
state.request = AuthenticatorRequest(
requestingSite = requestingSite,
requestingPort = requestingPort,
requestingProtocol = requestingProtocol,
requestingPrompt = requestingPrompt,
defaultUserName = defaultUserName,
)
TODO("Return `PasswordAuthentication` from here once we have it")
}
}
My initial thought was, maybe I can tie up the requester thread until the username and password are provided. But how do we know when the credentials have been provided from this callback?
My second thought was, maybe I could do it with a MutableStateFlow. But it didn't seem to be the intended use case.
LiveData.observe looks like it might do the job, were this on Android, but I'm currently on desktop.
Maybe I could come up with some custom implementation of MutableState with additional methods to wait for the value to be set? I'd have a bit of a mess if the dialog were cancelled, I'm sure, but maybe I could figure something out. (I have to be careful of potential multiple calls to authenticators, too, but realistically there can only be one login dialog on the screen at a time, so it shouldn't be too hard to orchestrate that.)
Are there any existing examples of UI being implemented in Compose for this sort of synchronous callback? When I tried to find existing demos, all the ones I found seemed to be assuming that the username and password were already known before connecting.

Are you required to use jakarta.mail.Authenticator? Using legacy Java APIs that are not coroutine-aware is a bit awkward in Kotlin. It can be done, of course, but then please also provide the code where you plug this into the Session and how this Session is connected to your composables. If you are open for alternatives then please remove all references to the Java APIs and instead describe the workflow you want to achieve and the network APIs you use.
