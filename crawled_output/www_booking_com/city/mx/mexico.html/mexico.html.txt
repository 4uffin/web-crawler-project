AAlexanderFromBulgariaThe breakfast at the hotel was the best one we had during our stay in Mexico and we went quite a few places. We tried the restaurant at dinner as well and it was very good. The location was perfect as it is quite central and less than a 10 min walk to the central plaza. Much like most first-time tourists in Mexico, initially we thought we would only use Uber for safety reasons but we felt very safe and walked at all times of the day (and night). In the evening the area has people around but it's not noisy. Honestly, this was the best value-for-money booking I've had in a long time. Three of the four rooms we booked were enormous and the queen size beds were incredibly comfortable.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.19.1Wonderful - What previous guests thought, 2,443 reviewsWonderful 2,443 reviewsPrice from$74.041 night, 2 adultsCheck availabilityFiesta Americana Viaducto AeropuertoHotel in Iztacalco, Mexico CityLocated in Mexico City and with National Palace reachable within 4.5 miles, Fiesta Americana Viaducto Aeropuerto provides concierge services, non-smoking rooms, a fitness center, free WiFi throughout...AAngelicaFromCuraçaotop 1 hotel.

Founded in 1325 by the Aztecs as Tenochtitlan, it was both destroyed and rebuilt by the Spanish in the 16th century. Nowadays, it is the capital of the United Mexican States and its most important economic and cultural center.The city center’s cornerstone is the famous Plaza de la Constitución, commonly called Zócalo. It's surrounded by the presidential Palacio Nacional and the Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral.The Avenida de la Reforma was built under the brief rule of Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian of Austria, while the deposed president Porfirio Díaz left a characteristic fusion of French-Mexican architecture. The 1960s saw a demographic explosion that only now is starting to be completely absorbed.From the Chapultepec Parks and the chic Polanco, to the gay area of Zona Rosa and the Bohemian and intellectual Coyoacán: let Mexico City tell you its thousand secrets and stories.Most of the hotels are located around the Reforma area, the Insurgentes Avenue and the Zócalo. If you’re looking for 5-star hotels in Mexico City, the modern Santa Fe area has a recently redeveloped business sector.

It seems like there are great restaurants around every corner. And people are super welcoming and friendly. The bar scene for going out is also perfect for people who don't just like staying in their hotel rooms. I already plan on visiting again and I'd recommend Mexico City for sure to other travelers. It also feels a lot safer than media in other countries try to tell you. I felt safe and welcomed everywhere I went, and prices were affordable, especially if you travel from the U.S. or Europe.Show moreRGuest review byRobinGermany8.0There is a lot to like about Mexico City.There is a lot to like about Mexico City. Primarily the food is fabulous. I'm a little paranoid about food in Mexico but I had no problems. I highly recommend Expendio de Maiz Sin Nombre. The city is eminently walkable with a terrific Metro system. At no time did I feel even slightly unsafe. The Anthropology Museum is a must see. I will add a word of caution. At least for me altitude sickness was a real problem - you may need to add time to acclimate yourself.Show moreSGuest review byStuartCanada10.0Extremely clean everywhere, including all the public toilet...Extremely clean everywhere, including all the public toilet facilities. For a European the cost of living is very low. Easy to get around. I walked or got an Uber but I was told that the public transport is good and again, cheap. I always felt safe, but I obviously avoided any dodgy areas, especially at night, as one would in any big city. The traffic is dreadful, so as it is so big, you have to factor in the time it takes to get from place to place. Great museums which are either free or about £4/5. People are lovely, very gentle and helpful. I booked a day trip to Teotihuacan which was excellent. Loads of restaurants and food outlets. I loved Los Azulejos, near Bellas Artes. The Chapultepec Park is beautiful for a relaxing walk.Show moreSGuest review bySusanUnited Kingdom6.0It’s an interesting, beautiful place.It’s an interesting, beautiful place.
