EEsraFromTurkeyThe property has the feeling like being at home. There is a living and dining room where you can meet new people and chat. And also a huge kitchen where you can prepare your own meals or keep your staff in the fridge. I stayed on the penthouse with a huge terrace for my own use only. There were sunbeds and chairs to enjoy the sun & stars‚Ä¶ Isaac & Vincent were really hospitable. They organize movie and tacos night while my 3 nights stay there. Isaac took us to the best taco place.

I was skeptical at first reading much negative reviews after I booked the trip and believe me, I was reading alot.
Free transportation was offered from the Hotel but booking.com offered a free ride from the airport to Jungala so I chose that route instead. The communication was with Me Transfer communicating
through Whats
app. Before we landed, I was notified through What's app. This
communication
was with me after I landed, all the way until we saw the driver.This ride went smooth from the Cancun airport to Jungala hotel. When we got to the resort, there was no wait. 1st stop, the bell boy took our bags, 2nd stop, straight to our Hotel where are suitcase followed shortly.( 10 minutes or less ). I'm giving a bit of a long review because of all the negative reviews I read. I want to make sure i write my experience. The suite that I stayed at was Jungala, lobby building. Staff was excellent and pleasant and spoke very well English. Our room was in tip top condition. Shampoo, conditioner, body wash, shower cap, nail file, make up remover,lip moisturizer, bubble bath, bubble oil, scrub, toothbrush, toothpaste, slippers, bathrobe, cheese board, bread, fruits, awaited for our family as we walked in. What a treat!!! (I'm sure I'm missing some amenities in the review).Josephina, Alejandro, Alexia along with the rest of the staff ( were all exceptional). All tranfers with the golf cart was speedy. No wait at all! If we had to wait, it was like 30 seconds. I booked the fiesta all you can eat and that was a great choice. It's a must see. Once at the resort, it was helpful to download the Vidanta app. This tells you what activities are going on daily. Yes, this resort is very big and the directions on the premises from one point to another is a bit confusing at times, but not all the time. There are staff around to ask as well.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.19.1Wonderful - What previous guests thought, 26 reviewsWonderful 26 reviewsPrice from$6151 night, 2 adultsCheck availabilityVilla Sofia Boutique Hotel - Near Cancun Downtown - Free CancellationHotel in Downtown Cancun, Canc√∫nIn a prime location in the center of Canc√∫n, Villa Sofia Boutique Hotel - Near Cancun Downtown - Free Cancellation provides air-conditioned rooms, an outdoor swimming pool, free WiFi and a garden.

100...Mid-September and the weather was unbelievably awful.
100 degrees and 98% humidity.
I definitely came at the wrong time of the year.
This place is party central; if you're not a partier, I'd suggest staying someplace closer to what you enjoy; if you're a diver, I'd suggest Puerto Vallarta.
If you're into archeology, I'd suggest Playa del Carmen.
But if you're a newlywed and only into partying and booze, this is your place.Show moreJGuest review byJenniferUnited States10.0‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a great place to visit, especially if you need dental...‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a great place to visit, especially if you need dental care.

We felt safe all the time (with the exception of crossing the streets, due to speed and disregard of pedestrian crossings). The area is very wide, so try to pick your hotel based on your planned
activities. We made four day trips and everything was great, on time pick ups, great content, but most of our stuff was further south so we had 1-3 hour bus rides to get to some of the spots. The crystalline water pics in the review are from our trip to Cozumel. Sunscreen is banned for many activities, so plan accordingly.

We had a departure flight delay so weren't leaving until 3:00 and they allowed us to stay on the resort with our wrist bands which was great.Valet parking was included. Food was wonderful, entertainment was great. The only other luxury all inclusive I have been to is Sandals, but I preferred this hotel even though I typically don't prefer large resorts.Show morePGuest review byPeterCanadaAvani Cancun Airport -previously NH Cancun Airport-Canc√∫nFrom $126.31 per nightScored out of 10, guest rating 8.48.4Very Good - What previous guests thought, 1,810 reviews Very Good¬†¬∑¬†1,810 reviewsAbsolutely DO NOT recommend. 100% disappointed. Worst value for money in Cancun. Absolutely shocking breakfast. Scamming taxi services. We visit Cancun all the time for work. Would DEFINITELY NOT RETURN.
AVOID UNLESS YOU WANT TO RUIN YOUR HOLIDAYS!!! DEFINITELY AVOID FOR A NIGHT BEFORE A FLIGHT.
We are still waiting for our transfer to take us to the hotel, they ignored it. So we could get scammed by the taxis at the airport.Show moreMGuest review byMrs. Ysla WhiteSpainBeach Front Condos in Hotel ZoneCanc√∫nFrom $152.65 per nightScored out of 10, guest rating 6.06.0Pleasant - What previous guests thought, 455 reviews Pleasant¬†¬∑¬†455 reviewsThe location is great, it is right on the beach and easy to access from the busier parts of the
hotel zone / Cancun downtown via bus or taxi. The staff was friendly and helpful. Communication was easy with the owner via what‚Äôs app. As you can expect, it is not a luxury stay but it is a good deal if you have that in mind with your expectations!Show moreKGuest review byKearaUnited StatesCity Express by Marriott Cancun AeropuertoCanc√∫nFrom $86.63 per nightScored out of 10, guest rating 7.97.9Good - What previous guests thought, 3,378 reviews Good¬†¬∑¬†3,378 reviewsWe needed a quick stopover in Cancun near the airport before continuing to our final destination.
We picked the hotel for the airport proximity, the free shuttle and the comfort. Everything was fine, the room was clean and comfortable as described. The reception lady who checked us in and the shuttle driver were friendly and welcoming.Show moreMGuest review byMarcoCanadaVilla PalmerasCanc√∫nFrom $153.26 per nightScored out of 10, guest rating 7.77.7Good - What previous guests thought, 1,445 reviews Good¬†¬∑¬†1,445 reviewsNice, clean and spacious room with enormous bed, relaxing area close to the pool, on-site restaurant.
