The water pressure in the shower was strong and refreshing, the Wi-Fi worked perfectly the entire time, and we really appreciated the little touches that made the space feel special. One of our favorite surprises was the fun mural just outside our window—it added so much character and charm.

I was skeptical at first reading much negative reviews after I booked the trip and believe me, I was reading alot.
Free transportation was offered from the Hotel but booking.com offered a free ride from the airport to Jungala so I chose that route instead. The communication was with Me Transfer communicating
through Whats
app. Before we landed, I was notified through What's app. This
communication
was with me after I landed, all the way until we saw the driver.This ride went smooth from the Cancun airport to Jungala hotel. When we got to the resort, there was no wait. 1st stop, the bell boy took our bags, 2nd stop, straight to our Hotel where are suitcase followed shortly.( 10 minutes or less ). I'm giving a bit of a long review because of all the negative reviews I read. I want to make sure i write my experience. The suite that I stayed at was Jungala, lobby building. Staff was excellent and pleasant and spoke very well English. Our room was in tip top condition. Shampoo, conditioner, body wash, shower cap, nail file, make up remover,lip moisturizer, bubble bath, bubble oil, scrub, toothbrush, toothpaste, slippers, bathrobe, cheese board, bread, fruits, awaited for our family as we walked in. What a treat!!! (I'm sure I'm missing some amenities in the review).Josephina, Alejandro, Alexia along with the rest of the staff ( were all exceptional). All tranfers with the golf cart was speedy. No wait at all! If we had to wait, it was like 30 seconds. I booked the fiesta all you can eat and that was a great choice. It's a must see. Once at the resort, it was helpful to download the Vidanta app. This tells you what activities are going on daily. Yes, this resort is very big and the directions on the premises from one point to another is a bit confusing at times, but not all the time. There are staff around to ask as well.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.19.1Wonderful - What previous guests thought, 26 reviewsWonderful 26 reviewsLocation 9.1Price from$6151 night, 2 adultsCheck availabilityVilla Sofia Boutique Hotel - Near Cancun Downtown - Free CancellationHotel in Downtown Cancun, CancúnIn a prime location in the center of Cancún, Villa Sofia Boutique Hotel - Near Cancun Downtown - Free Cancellation provides air-conditioned rooms, an outdoor swimming pool, free WiFi and a garden.

100...Mid-September and the weather was unbelievably awful.
100 degrees and 98% humidity.
I definitely came at the wrong time of the year.
This place is party central; if you're not a partier, I'd suggest staying someplace closer to what you enjoy; if you're a diver, I'd suggest Puerto Vallarta.
If you're into archeology, I'd suggest Playa del Carmen.
But if you're a newlywed and only into partying and booze, this is your place.Show moreJGuest review byJenniferUnited States10.0“It’s a great place to visit, especially if you need dental...“It’s a great place to visit, especially if you need dental care.

We felt safe all the time (with the exception of crossing the streets, due to speed and disregard of pedestrian crossings). The area is very wide, so try to pick your hotel based on your planned
activities. We made four day trips and everything was great, on time pick ups, great content, but most of our stuff was further south so we had 1-3 hour bus rides to get to some of the spots.
