Free travel for under 5s. The city isn't crazy busy in August despite its size, and seemingly lots of locals on holiday.
Pick your eateries wisely, as you should be able to eat out for very competitive prices. Small number of places try to rip you off. So try to eat off the main squares or in the suburbs. Felt safe the entire trip. Lots of play parks if you have kids and want to distract them. Mercado San Miguel, Plaza Mayor, Plaza Sol, Santiago Bernabeu & El Retiro Park are a must.
