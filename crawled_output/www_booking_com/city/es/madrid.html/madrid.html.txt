The staff were incredibly nice and helpful, always going the extra mile to ensure a pleasant stay. The facilities are new and modern, giving a fresh and welcoming atmosphere.
The room was spotlessly clean and very comfortable, making it easy to relax and unwind. One of the highlights was the free coffee and drinks available 24 hours a day—a fantastic perk that made the stay even more enjoyable.
While the location is a bit far from Madrid's city center, it's just an 8-minute walk to Bus E1, which takes you directly there. It's a small inconvenience compared to the overall quality and experience this hotel provides.

The renowned Prado Museum holds one of the world’s finest art collections with iconic paintings by El Greco, Velázquez and Goya. For a more modern touch, the Museo Reina Sofia houses works by Picasso and Dali. Start your evening at Puerta del Sol, one of the city’s busiest spots. Make some room in your stomach for great tapas and sangria in La Latina district, south of the city’s most famous plaza, Plaza Mayor. Real Madrid plays at Santiago Bernabeu and Atlético Madrid competes at Vicente Calderón Stadium, two opportunities that no sports fan will want to miss.

Free travel for under 5s. The city isn't crazy busy in August despite its size, and seemingly lots of locals on holiday.
Pick your eateries wisely, as you should be able to eat out for very competitive prices. Small number of places try to rip you off. So try to eat off the main squares or in the suburbs. Felt safe the entire trip. Lots of play parks if you have kids and want to distract them. Mercado San Miguel, Plaza Mayor, Plaza Sol, Santiago Bernabeu & El Retiro Park are a must.
