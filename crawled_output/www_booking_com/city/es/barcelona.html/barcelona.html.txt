There were a lot more homeless people than I expected, felt unsafe at night.
The first thing you should do is book a tour market - you will get a good understanding of the culture and get a sense of how to continue your trip.
Suggest coming to the tourist attraction as early as possible, around 11-13
will be very packed.
Las Ramblas was okay, the trip would be the same without it, really just a packed street, and the whole idea is to fool tourists.
Look for the streets that the locals are going to.
BOOK TICKETS FOR Sagrada Família MONTES IN ADVANCE AND ONLY IN THE MORNING!
In the mall, you have to pay 1.50 euros to use the bathroom.
You should plan where you are going to eat.
For us, it was really overwhelming, having so many options.
For families with young children, I really recommend L'Aquàrium de Barcelona.
Really easy to get around, the last thing you should worry about.Show moreSGuest review bySofi8.0The Gaudi Basílica was interesting but I much prefer the...The Gaudi Basílica was interesting but I much prefer the Cathedral!

I managed to get lost in a run down housing estate on the outskirts of town. No one bothered or harassed me, i was quite safe.
Everyone has their iPhones out on the metro too, so stories about theft are not true.
The metro is SO much easier to navigate than the Paris
one, i love the colour coding; it makes it so much easier to find your way around.

Everyone was nice and quite helpful. Many fine restaurants, to mention a few The Enrich cafe and pastry shop, with many fine pastries as well as bread. Good coffee. The Hungry eyes Indian cuisine restaurant was very good. I haven’t really liked Indian cuisine but this place changed my mind, it was excellent and the owners were great. The Honest Greens restaurant was unique and very good.
We ate there twice. There were other restaurants we went to I do not remember them all , but there wasn’t a bad restaurant among them. All were fantastic. We learned how to use public transportation , but mostly we walked. If there is a next time, I would do as I did this time, but I would use an electric bike to get around .Show moreAGuest review byAnonymousSee reviews by guests who stayed at hotels in BarcelonaSee allOlivia Balmes HotelEixample, BarcelonaFrom $469.34 per nightScored out of 10, guest rating 9.39.3Wonderful - What previous guests thought, 2,015 reviews Wonderful · 2,015 reviewsVisited Barcelona, stay here for 4 night, it was a amazing experience for me and my bestie...

Although the hotel is in the quarter Raval and there's street prostitution around the corner, you should not be afraid.
Inside the hotel there's a green courtyard, perfect meeting point, when you travel with groups. And an oasis compared with the noisy streets outside.
