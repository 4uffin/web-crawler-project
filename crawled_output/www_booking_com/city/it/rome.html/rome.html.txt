Standing inside the Colosseum made me realise the depth of history we often only read about. The art in the Vatican, the beauty of the piazzas, and even simple moments like sipping coffee gave me a deep sense of connection to the past. Rome wasn’t just a holiday, it felt like a journey through time, culture, and faith.Show moreHGuest review byHayiathUnited Arab Emirates10.0It was easy to visit Trevi Fountain, the Patheon and Plaza...It was easy to visit Trevi Fountain, the Patheon and Plaza Navarona in the morning.

Needs to see it in your own eyes to appreciate the 2000 years and more of structures survived to tell the world their stories
Easy bus/train transportation to move around, cost 1.50 euro for 100 minutes from the first activation.
Cash needed to buy transmission tickets at cigarettes kiosks around the city.
Bring your reusable water bottle as there are free tasty clean water to fill your bottle around the city.
Cannot express in words the beauty of Rome as to offer
I've been for my first time for 2 1/2 days and managed to view 95% of all the main attractions and taste about 80% of local dishes and pastries.
Definitely will come back for more, enjoyed every minute of it and walked daily average of 20,000 steps

It's not the Rome I remember (my 8th trip but...9/3/25
It's not the Rome I remember (my 8th trip but traveling with a first timer) It has become over run by tourists, actually taking away from the beauty.
You fight crowds at every turn and miss the beauty.
There is no such thing as finding that gem of a Restaurant down an untraveled allley anymore.
Maybe I've gotten older, but strollinng at night when the tourists are back at their accomodations wasn't all that magical anymore.
The Vatican was disappointing in that most areas of the Basilica was a barricaded pathway to herd the masses through.
You didn't enjoy just roaming through looking at everything like in the past.
I don't know what it was abouit the lighting in the Sistine Chapel, but it wasn't as I remembered.
Then let's talk about the Piazza... not able to walk freely through or linger... in fact, wasn't accessable at all.
In a word:
SAD
Coloseum:
Nothing exciting or fun outside anymore.
The Culture has been lost, sloppily dressed, demanding tourists, and restaurant menus are all the same.
Piazzas filled with more tables than space.
If I ever return ... it will be in a very Off Season.Show moreBGuest review byBarbaraUnited States8.0Great selection of places to visit.Great selection of places to visit.
