EEvgeniiFromArmeniaWe have chosen Umiltà 36 for our vacation in Rome and our stay was amazing. This hotel is located in the very heart of Rome - just a few minutes from the Trevi fountain - but hidden on a quiet street, which makes it a true gem.
Our room was not only beautifully decorated, but also thoughtfully and smartly designed, the bed and pillows were exceptionally comfortable and there was no noise from outside in the room.
The hotel restaurant “Aquamarina” has a great seafood menu with local dishes and wine.
What makes Umiltà 36 really special, however, is the people. Every staff member we’ve interacted with was friendly and genuinely helpful. And what is most important, during our stay our little daughter was treated like a princess - which meant the world to us.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.69.6Exceptional - What previous guests thought, 2,046 reviewsExceptional 2,046 reviewsLocation 9.8Price from$900.751 night, 2 adultsCheck availabilityH10 Palazzo GallaHotel in Trevi, RomeLocated in Rome, a 5-minute walk from Quirinale Palace, H10 Palazzo Galla provides accommodations with a shared lounge, private parking, a terrace and a bar.
