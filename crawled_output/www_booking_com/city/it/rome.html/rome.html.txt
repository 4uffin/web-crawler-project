It's not the Rome I remember (my 8th trip but...9/3/25
It's not the Rome I remember (my 8th trip but traveling with a first timer) It has become over run by tourists, actually taking away from the beauty.
You fight crowds at every turn and miss the beauty.
There is no such thing as finding that gem of a Restaurant down an untraveled allley anymore.
Maybe I've gotten older, but strollinng at night when the tourists are back at their accomodations wasn't all that magical anymore.
The Vatican was disappointing in that most areas of the Basilica was a barricaded pathway to herd the masses through.
You didn't enjoy just roaming through looking at everything like in the past.
I don't know what it was abouit the lighting in the Sistine Chapel, but it wasn't as I remembered.
Then let's talk about the Piazza... not able to walk freely through or linger... in fact, wasn't accessable at all.
In a word:
SAD
Coloseum:
Nothing exciting or fun outside anymore.
The Culture has been lost, sloppily dressed, demanding tourists, and restaurant menus are all the same.
Piazzas filled with more tables than space.
If I ever return ... it will be in a very Off Season.Show moreBGuest review byBarbaraUnited States8.0Great selection of places to visit.Great selection of places to visit.
