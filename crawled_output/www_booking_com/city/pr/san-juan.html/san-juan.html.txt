All the best restaurants of Old San Juan are steps away. Plus the rooftop bar, restaurant and pool are amazing! My only suggestion is that there be more lounge area for during the day. It would be very easy to add some lounge chairs where there is tables. Many more would be able to enjoy that area. Many other guests felt the same on this issue. It is a
new hotel so I am sure things like this will be observed and changed.

Old San Juan was so very beautiful. The preserved history, the knowledgeable tour guides and the quaint cobbled streets.
Another plus was the free pick up and drop off bus that worked inside Old San Juan. FANTASTIC!
I mostly got take out at the Chinese Food places. It was good.

La Lechonera original in Guavate offers delicious fresh food at reasonable prices if you enjoy pig roast, ribs, tamale and plantains. Visited Culebra get tickets online via Puerto Rico ferry.

It is such a amazing city and has SO much to offer. Everything from the nature, to the old town, to the infinite number of beaches -
I could have stayed for a month. Puerto Rico's culture is lovely and the people friendly even if you don't speak Spanish. The people of Puerto Rico are proud of their Island and will be happy to share their recommendations. I went as a female solo-traveler and felt safer than I do on a normal day in NYC. I would recommend branching out from the gentrified tourist areas such as Condado and go to more local restaurants, kiosks and beaches to get a sense of the real culture. I loved Pinones beach for example, which also has great food and many locals go swim here. I would also recommend visiting Culebra. Talk to your Uber drivers and/or other locals – they are proud of their island and will happily share the most beautiful gems with you. Lastly, don't leave without trying MOFONGO at least once. So delicious. Overall, I'm so impressed with this place and want to see more of this beautiful island.Show moreAGuest review byAnonymousSee reviews by guests who stayed at hotels in San JuanSee allSan Juan Marriott Resort and Stellaris CasinoSanturce, San JuanFrom $400.82 per nightScored out of 10, guest rating 8.68.6Excellent - What previous guests thought, 454 reviews Excellent · 454 reviewsWe recently stayed at this hotel for 3 nights, paying $759 per night, and while there were definitely some highlights, there were also a few areas where the experience didn’t quite live up to 4‑star expectations.
