Taipei 101, once the world’s tallest building, dominates its skyline from Xinyi, an area known for the most active nightlife.At Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall the national flag is raised every morning and the guard changed every hour. Less known for tourists is National Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, containing a tall bronze statue of the country’s founding father.Taipei has tons of museums, but the best are Shung Ye Museum of Formosan Aborigines and the National Palace Museum – one of world’s largest collections of Chinese artifacts. Even more numerous are the temples dedicated to Buddhist, Taoist and Chinese folk religions. Xinsheng South Road is nicknamed "Road to Heaven" for its sheer number, but most famous is Longshan Temple in Wanhua, the oldest district.Taipei shopping is fantastic and includes Core Pacific Living Mall, supposedly Asia’s largest. The Ximending area has lots of shops (and karaoke), while the Shilin Night Market should not be missed. For a break from the bustle head to central Daan Forest Park, the botanical gardens with its lotus ponds,or Yangmingshan National Park, known for hot spring baths and spring cherry blossom.Whether you fly into Songshan or Taiwan Taoyuan Airport, the well connected public transportation system can take you to any Taipei hotel on Booking.com.Learn more about visiting Taipei152 points of interest19 neighborhoodsFind out moreWhat Guests Said About Taipei:10.0Taipei offers something for every traveler, making it...Taipei offers something for every traveler, making it perfect for both short breaks and longer adventures.

It feels just like a luxury hotel with the same comfort as home. The receptionist is also very sweet, she gave me lots of recommendations. Would go here again if i go back to taipei!Show moreAGuest review byAnonymousFranceSimple + HotelSongshan District , TaipeiFrom $164.77 per nightScored out of 10, guest rating 8.58.5Very Good - What previous guests thought, 2,842 reviews Very Good · 2,842 reviewsOne of the few possibilties in Taipei to have a room with a balcony. The hotel feels like home, it's a wonderful place to calm down after a buzy day in the city. The rooftop of the hotel is great. Massage chairs are a nice extra. The breakfast was wonderful, a wide variety of choice for anyone's taste.Show moreJGuest review byJeanNetherlands苓旅-站前 Lin Inn TMSZhongzheng District, TaipeiFrom $98.20 per nightScored out of 10, guest rating 7.97.9Good - What previous guests thought, 3,832 reviews Good · 3,832 reviewsPro:
