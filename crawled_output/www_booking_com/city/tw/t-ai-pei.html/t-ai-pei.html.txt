Two of their restaurant suggestions were on point, and we appreciated them giving a personal suggestion. They were kind enough to also make reservations for us without us asking. Wow!!

Taipei 101, once the world’s tallest building, dominates its skyline from Xinyi, an area known for the most active nightlife.At Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall the national flag is raised every morning and the guard changed every hour. Less known for tourists is National Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, containing a tall bronze statue of the country’s founding father.Taipei has tons of museums, but the best are Shung Ye Museum of Formosan Aborigines and the National Palace Museum – one of world’s largest collections of Chinese artifacts. Even more numerous are the temples dedicated to Buddhist, Taoist and Chinese folk religions. Xinsheng South Road is nicknamed "Road to Heaven" for its sheer number, but most famous is Longshan Temple in Wanhua, the oldest district.Taipei shopping is fantastic and includes Core Pacific Living Mall, supposedly Asia’s largest. The Ximending area has lots of shops (and karaoke), while the Shilin Night Market should not be missed. For a break from the bustle head to central Daan Forest Park, the botanical gardens with its lotus ponds,or Yangmingshan National Park, known for hot spring baths and spring cherry blossom.Whether you fly into Songshan or Taiwan Taoyuan Airport, the well connected public transportation system can take you to any Taipei hotel on Booking.com.Learn more about visiting Taipei152 points of interest19 neighborhoodsFind out moreWhat Guests Said About Taipei:10.0Taipei offers something for every traveler, making it...Taipei offers something for every traveler, making it perfect for both short breaks and longer adventures.
