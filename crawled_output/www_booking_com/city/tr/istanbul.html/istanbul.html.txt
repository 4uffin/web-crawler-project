The amazing Old Town and the Sultanahmet are home to iconic Blue Mosque and the Hagia Sophia. More history is hidden in the Topkapi Palace, where you can glimpse the splendor and opulence of Turkey’s Ottoman heritage. Take a stroll through the historic center or the busy Taksim Square before watching the sun set behind countless mosques and minarets. Local fish markets and numerous restaurants lining the bridge to Galata offer the Golden Horn’s daily catch. If you prefer the fine art of bargaining to fine art, lose yourself in the Grand Bazar and maybe you’ll emerge with a hookah, some Turkish coffee, or even a carpet. The Spice Bazar further immerses you in the sights, smells, and tastes of Turkish culture. Getting to Istanbul is an easy trip from Ataturk International Airport or Sabiha Gokcen Airport. Whether you want a luxury hotel on the Asian side or a budget hostel in Taksim Square, Booking.com has over 1,000 great accommodations for a vacation in Istanbul.Learn more about visiting Istanbul2605 attractions140 points of interest56 neighborhoodsFind out moreWhat Guests Said About Istanbul:8.0Istanbul is a good place to visit offering something for...Istanbul is a good place to visit offering something for everyone from culture to food.
One particular improvement could be brought by banning SMOKING IN PUBLIC PLACES. I found every second person smoking anywhere and everywhere, unmindful of social etiquette. I live in Wales , where we are blessed with clean air, it felt that my lungs would choke with smoke in the air as at most places- public benches, passages, shops, walk ways ----people just smoked. As a non smoker I am sure , many like me would welcome regulation of smoking at public spaces.
Overall, the city is much like any tourist attraction giving each one whatever they crave from food to night life to shopping at Misr and Grand Bazar. I found Asian side more reasonable and affordable , infact, Asian side of Istanbul is more European than the European side itself. Istanbul is full of lovely cats that adds to its beauty and locals and tourists adore them alike. The tickets at tourist attractions are quite pricey, cards are confusing (Istanbulkart etc) and one must remain careful how money is spent from food and shopping to transport and visiting important monuments.Show moreAGuest review byArpu10.0If you like a vibrant city that is so different from...If you like a vibrant city that is so different from European cities, Istanbul is the place to go.

The experience with vendors is a bit difficult since they are friendly but rather aggressive in inviting you into their stores and restaurants. It's a huge city, so leave some extra time to explore and go outside Istanbul if you have the opportunity. Get out of the main squares and attractions and explore the backstreets and alleys for a more authentic view of Istanbul. Try all the foods, not the foreign chains to taste Turkish food and coffee. Go to the Basilica Cistern, it was a rare treat!Show moreSGuest review byStevenUnited States10.0It wasn't my first trip to Istanbul so I knew what to expect...It wasn't my first trip to Istanbul so I knew what to expect. Yes the locals don't speak English, neither other non-Turkish languages. But one can manage with it. Yes the road traffic is chaotic but once you become chaotic, you're in. The people are anyway very welcoming: Istanbul is a multicultural city and it shows. The public transport system may look tricky but if understood, you can get everywhere whithout expensive taxi. Overall, it's still the ancient Constantinopolis. A worthy place to visit, in my opinion.Show moreMGuest review byMichaelFinland10.0Wonderful city and great history sites.Wonderful city and great history sites. Could be very energy and physically demanding due to a geographical position(7 hills). If you are in the shopping, there is no other like Istanbul in the world.
But , I must say this…..
Please , ask and confirm ALL AND ANY PRICE FOR ANYTHING AT ALL before you do anything.
….before you sit, drink , eat, go to bathroom…..
Ask price for anything EVER IT IS A BIZARRE THING like toothpicks, paper towels, bowl of rice…..ANYTHING.
Likely, I learned my lesson that cost me only 25€ but situation that occur was so bizarre that I must share it with a world.
I probably will not go to Istanbul any time soon because I am too sick and tired dealing with this issue.
Their scams make me feel cheap and stingy.

So much to see and do, it's a bustle and hustle city that mixes the exotic with European style, with very many places to eat fabulous food, try delicacies such as stuffed mussels and deep-fried mussels, super ocakbasi to choose from, close-by the beautiful Bosphorus with its sparkling waters and twinkly nighttime lighting, ideal for a boat trip, or sit and have a super dinner in Bebek overlooking the panorama of Istanbul.Show moreDGuest review byDr John United KingdomSee reviews by guests who stayed at hotels in IstanbulSee allElement GardenBeyoglu, IstanbulFrom $104.53 per nightScored out of 10, guest rating 9.09.0Wonderful - What previous guests thought, 1,171 reviews Wonderful · 1,171 reviewsEverything was perfect, our stay at the element garden was one of the best things in our trip , the location is awesome in a calm street few minutes walk from Taksim square , rooms very clean with the necessary equipment we even cooked there and could eat in the hotel’s garden , the staff were extremely nice and helpful especially Ella who was preparing very good breakfasts and was extremely nice , I recommend this hotel for a relaxing and enjoyable stay in IstanbulShow moreSGuest review bySouadAlgeriaWyndham Istanbul Old CityFatih, IstanbulFrom $352 per nightScored out of 10, guest rating 7.17.1Good - What previous guests thought, 5,745 reviews Good · 5,745 reviews🇬🇧 l have so amazing time this hotel is very comfortable very relaxing the best 5 star hotel in Istanbul near for everything shopping in the town very easy ef you want to go any where
