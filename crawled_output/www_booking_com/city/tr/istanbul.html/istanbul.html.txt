First of all a big thank you to Esat, Fouad, Baran, Ertan and Ahmet for the kind hospitality. They made our stay smooth and easy. It honestly felt like we were at home away from home.
The hotel is very modern and decor relaxing.
Our room had every amenity anyone could possibly need!
Bathroom and shower are very clean and we had fresh towels daily. The room is spacious enough to fit all our luggage and still have space to walk around easily.
Location is central and made transportation extremely easy. The Gulhane train station is right across the street and the T1 tram line is quick 2 minute walk away. Surrounding the hotel are lively streets full of restaurants and shops. Hagia Sophia is walking distance away.
Thank you to the friendly staff for guiding us around the Sirkeci area since it was our first stay there.

The amazing Old Town and the Sultanahmet are home to iconic Blue Mosque and the Hagia Sophia. More history is hidden in the Topkapi Palace, where you can glimpse the splendor and opulence of Turkey’s Ottoman heritage. Take a stroll through the historic center or the busy Taksim Square before watching the sun set behind countless mosques and minarets. Local fish markets and numerous restaurants lining the bridge to Galata offer the Golden Horn’s daily catch. If you prefer the fine art of bargaining to fine art, lose yourself in the Grand Bazar and maybe you’ll emerge with a hookah, some Turkish coffee, or even a carpet. The Spice Bazar further immerses you in the sights, smells, and tastes of Turkish culture. Getting to Istanbul is an easy trip from Ataturk International Airport or Sabiha Gokcen Airport. Whether you want a luxury hotel on the Asian side or a budget hostel in Taksim Square, Booking.com has over 1,000 great accommodations for a vacation in Istanbul.Learn more about visiting Istanbul2605 attractions140 points of interest56 neighborhoodsFind out moreWhat Guests Said About Istanbul:10.0Istanbul is a wonderful city to visit.Istanbul is a wonderful city to visit.
8 days was not enough.
This city is very rich in history & culture.
Food is fabulous, although prices nowadays are a little steep so plan and prepare properly.
People are very friendly, very safe to walk at night as well, we felt comfortable & safe in all places we visited.
Wear correct footwear when visiting Istanbul, most of the streets in Istanbul are inclined.
Don't forget to include Cappadocia in your itinerary, fantastic place as well.
Overall, the thousands of steps you will take in this city is worth it, we will definitely come back soon!Show moreRGuest review byRichard Alex AlconabaUnited Arab Emirates8.0Istanbul is a good place to visit offering something for...Istanbul is a good place to visit offering something for everyone from culture to food.
One particular improvement could be brought by banning SMOKING IN PUBLIC PLACES. I found every second person smoking anywhere and everywhere, unmindful of social etiquette. I live in Wales , where we are blessed with clean air, it felt that my lungs would choke with smoke in the air as at most places- public benches, passages, shops, walk ways ----people just smoked. As a non smoker I am sure , many like me would welcome regulation of smoking at public spaces.
Overall, the city is much like any tourist attraction giving each one whatever they crave from food to night life to shopping at Misr and Grand Bazar. I found Asian side more reasonable and affordable , infact, Asian side of Istanbul is more European than the European side itself. Istanbul is full of lovely cats that adds to its beauty and locals and tourists adore them alike. The tickets at tourist attractions are quite pricey, cards are confusing (Istanbulkart etc) and one must remain careful how money is spent from food and shopping to transport and visiting important monuments.Show moreAGuest review byArpu10.0If you like a vibrant city that is so different from...If you like a vibrant city that is so different from European cities, Istanbul is the place to go.

The experience with vendors is a bit difficult since they are friendly but rather aggressive in inviting you into their stores and restaurants. It's a huge city, so leave some extra time to explore and go outside Istanbul if you have the opportunity. Get out of the main squares and attractions and explore the backstreets and alleys for a more authentic view of Istanbul. Try all the foods, not the foreign chains to taste Turkish food and coffee. Go to the Basilica Cistern, it was a rare treat!Show moreSGuest review byStevenUnited States10.0It wasn't my first trip to Istanbul so I knew what to expect...It wasn't my first trip to Istanbul so I knew what to expect. Yes the locals don't speak English, neither other non-Turkish languages. But one can manage with it. Yes the road traffic is chaotic but once you become chaotic, you're in. The people are anyway very welcoming: Istanbul is a multicultural city and it shows. The public transport system may look tricky but if understood, you can get everywhere whithout expensive taxi. Overall, it's still the ancient Constantinopolis. A worthy place to visit, in my opinion.Show moreMGuest review byMichaelFinland10.0Wonderful city and great history sites.Wonderful city and great history sites. Could be very energy and physically demanding due to a geographical position(7 hills). If you are in the shopping, there is no other like Istanbul in the world.
But , I must say this…..
Please , ask and confirm ALL AND ANY PRICE FOR ANYTHING AT ALL before you do anything.
….before you sit, drink , eat, go to bathroom…..
Ask price for anything EVER IT IS A BIZARRE THING like toothpicks, paper towels, bowl of rice…..ANYTHING.
Likely, I learned my lesson that cost me only 25€ but situation that occur was so bizarre that I must share it with a world.
I probably will not go to Istanbul any time soon because I am too sick and tired dealing with this issue.
Their scams make me feel cheap and stingy.

The staff is really friendly and helpfull A++
From Istanbul airport you could take a taxi to the hotel for around 700-800 Lira. They don`t offer breakfast but have coffee, coockies, water and some fruits available in the lobby. Around the hotel are plenty of restaurants where you can have
your breakfast.Show moreMGuest review byMennoNetherlandsApple Tree HotelFatih, IstanbulFrom $117.31 per nightScored out of 10, guest rating 8.58.5Very Good - What previous guests thought, 1,867 reviews Very Good · 1,867 reviewsAhmed, worker in this hotel is the best guy I have met in Istanbul.
