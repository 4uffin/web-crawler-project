A taxi or exhilarating tuk-tuk ride is never far away from the big attractions, which include Chinatown, Jim Thompson House and the floating markets at Damnoen Saduak.

The mix of golden temples and modern buildings makes every corner interesting. I loved visiting the Grand Palace and Wat Arun, and the floating markets were a totally new experience. Street food here is amazing—pad thai, mango sticky rice, and so many flavors you can’t miss. Shopping is fun too, from huge malls to little street stalls where you can bargain. Getting around is easy with the BTS Skytrain and boats, though the traffic can get crazy sometimes. The nightlife is also super lively with night markets and rooftop bars. Overall, Bangkok is full of energy, culture, and fun—perfect for both first-time and repeat travelers!”Show moreMGuest review byMohitBangladesh8.0Bangkok is a vibrant city teeming with life, great food and...Bangkok is a vibrant city teeming with life, great food and some amazing sights. It’s not for people who don’t like crowds and traffic though and there isn’t much greenery. Getting around isn’t easy and takes time as traffic jams are common.
Recommended sights are MOCA (Museum of Contemporary Art) (probably Bangkok’s best gallery) Wat Pho, Wat Arun at sunset and the Khon theatre. Recommended restaurant is Ama DimSum opposite Samyan Mitrtown, delicious Chinese Thai. Don’t be frightened to try cheaper food and street food as it’s often very good.Show morePGuest review byPanayiotisAustralia10.0We feel that the pollution and cleanliness

It is, in all ways, one of the most exciting and vibrant of places where pretty much most things are value for money and almost everything is a photograph.
Food is wonderful and varied and can be extremely cheap. Chaos and contrast are pretty much the norm but it needs to be experienced before a trip to the wondrous southern islands to make a holiday almost complete.

They are beautiful and amazing temple like the grand palace , Wat Saket Ratchawora Mahawihan (the golden mountain temple) and etc .
The boat along the Chaopraya River in day time is nice and convenient and dinner along the Chaopraya River is fantastic experience.
The IconSiam department store is huge lay along the Chaopraya River and there are lots of food dishes and good for shopping , can go by the boat.
