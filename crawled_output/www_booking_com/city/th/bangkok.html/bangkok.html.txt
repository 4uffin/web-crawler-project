Catch a boat up river on the Chao Phraya Express or discover different neighborhoods on the blissfully air-conditioned BTS Skytrain. A taxi or exhilarating tuk-tuk ride is never far away from the big attractions, which include Chinatown, Jim Thompson House and the floating markets at Damnoen Saduak.

The mix of golden temples and modern buildings makes every corner interesting. I loved visiting the Grand Palace and Wat Arun, and the floating markets were a totally new experience. Street food here is amazing—pad thai, mango sticky rice, and so many flavors you can’t miss. Shopping is fun too, from huge malls to little street stalls where you can bargain. Getting around is easy with the BTS Skytrain and boats, though the traffic can get crazy sometimes. The nightlife is also super lively with night markets and rooftop bars.

It’s not for people who don’t like crowds and traffic though and there isn’t much greenery. Getting around isn’t easy and takes time as traffic jams are common.
Recommended sights are MOCA (Museum of Contemporary Art) (probably Bangkok’s best gallery) Wat Pho, Wat Arun at sunset and the Khon theatre. Recommended restaurant is Ama DimSum opposite Samyan Mitrtown, delicious Chinese Thai.

It is, in all ways, one of the most exciting and vibrant of places where pretty much most things are value for money and almost everything is a photograph.
Food is wonderful and varied and can be extremely cheap. Chaos and contrast are pretty much the norm but it needs to be experienced before a trip to the wondrous southern islands to make a holiday almost complete.
