CCaraFromUnited StatesI had an EXCELLENT stay at ASAI. Everything from the friendly and helpful staff to the location to the functional and pristine spaces – it felt like a home away from home. It was my first stay in BKK and I couldn’t have been happier with my choice of hotel. Aus and Mee of the cafe were fantastic in making me feel welcome and comfortable when I was waiting for the check in time after a long flight. Room was tighter than your usual hotel but very efficient in the use of space, so you really don’t need more. Smart TV was a cool addition – I ate many a meals in bed watching my favorite shows. It was also pretty quiet at night and got really great sleep – the king bed was sooo comfy. Room cleaning was done without fail every day. I also got to meet the manager Vas who was on top of it – and even offered me a complimentary meal! Will definitely come back again.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.09.0Wonderful - What previous guests thought, 1,001 reviewsWonderful 1,001 reviewsLocation 9.3Price from$59.421 night, 2 adultsCheck availabilitydusitD2 Samyan BangkokHotel in Bang Rak, BangkokLocated in Bangkok, 1.5 miles from MBK Shopping Mall, dusitD2 Samyan Bangkok has accommodations with an outdoor swimming pool, free private parking, a fitness center and a restaurant. iiviymFromGreeceBest bed I ever slept!

TTengisFromMongoliaI stayed at SilQ Hotel and Residence from May 30 to August 19, 2025, with just a short two-week break elsewhere. For almost the entire time I was in Bangkok, SilQ truly became my second home. The property was excellent, my room was always clean, spacious, and comfortable, and the facilities were kept in very good condition.
What stood out most was the wonderful staff. From my very first day, the young lady who welcomed me at check-in left a lasting impression with her sweet and charming way of speaking. Later on, whenever I spoke with her on the phone or saw her around, she gave me the same warm feeling like a caring sister who genuinely looked after me. That kindness made my stay feel truly personal and comforting. The reception and concierge team overall were also outstanding, always thoughtful and professional.
As I had to limit my movements during this period (and still do now), the team went above and beyond — bringing everything I needed directly to my room. Their attentive care made my long stay so much easier and more comfortable.
I often ordered breakfast to my room, and it was always delicious, beautifully presented, and a wonderful way to start each morning.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.39.3Wonderful - What previous guests thought, 2,232 reviewsWonderful 2,232 reviewsLocation 9.1Price from$137.581 night, 2 adultsCheck availabilityChatrium Grand BangkokHotel in Pratunam, BangkokLocated in Bangkok, 0.9 miles from Siam Discovery, Chatrium Grand Bangkok provides accommodations with an outdoor swimming pool, free private parking, a fitness center and a restaurant.

The mix of golden temples and modern buildings makes every corner interesting. I loved visiting the Grand Palace and Wat Arun, and the floating markets were a totally new experience. Street food here is amazing—pad thai, mango sticky rice, and so many flavors you can’t miss. Shopping is fun too, from huge malls to little street stalls where you can bargain. Getting around is easy with the BTS Skytrain and boats, though the traffic can get crazy sometimes. The nightlife is also super lively with night markets and rooftop bars. Overall, Bangkok is full of energy, culture, and fun—perfect for both first-time and repeat travelers!”Show moreMGuest review byMohitBangladesh8.0Bangkok is a vibrant city teeming with life, great food and...Bangkok is a vibrant city teeming with life, great food and some amazing sights. It’s not for people who don’t like crowds and traffic though and there isn’t much greenery. Getting around isn’t easy and takes time as traffic jams are common.
Recommended sights are MOCA (Museum of Contemporary Art) (probably Bangkok’s best gallery) Wat Pho, Wat Arun at sunset and the Khon theatre. Recommended restaurant is Ama DimSum opposite Samyan Mitrtown, delicious Chinese Thai. Don’t be frightened to try cheaper food and street food as it’s often very good.Show morePGuest review byPanayiotisAustralia10.0We feel that the pollution and cleanliness

It is, in all ways, one of the most exciting and vibrant of places where pretty much most things are value for money and almost everything is a photograph.
Food is wonderful and varied and can be extremely cheap. Chaos and contrast are pretty much the norm but it needs to be experienced before a trip to the wondrous southern islands to make a holiday almost complete.

I searched the location of where the conference was and this hostel was around 1km away from it. I choose to not stay at the place where the conference was held as hotels in bangkok are usually very expensive. This hostel in that sense was the best deal. The female dormitory that i stayed in was a little compact but i guess given the price and the hostel location it was worth it.Show morePGuest review byPradnyaIndiaAscott Embassy Sathorn BangkokSathorn, BangkokFrom $150.91 per nightScored out of 10, guest rating 9.09.0Wonderful - What previous guests thought, 3,566 reviews Wonderful · 3,566 reviewsThe room was excellent, the facilities were well managed & in top conditions, services provided by the hotel staff and delivery level is top class! Truly deserving the rating, and price wise it is very reasonable in comparison to other hotels at similar level in Bangkok.
