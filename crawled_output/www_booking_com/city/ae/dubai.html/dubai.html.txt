Such a beautiful and vibrant city , very organized, clean, and full of amazing things to see and do. There’s always life and energy, both during the day and at night. I would definitely go back and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a mix of modern attractions, cultural experiences, and great hospitality. My favorite place was Jumeirah and Marina and fav restaurant Zuma (japanese) and Massimo’s (italian).
I also enjoyed sipping on some karak tea and paratha at Karak House, with the amazing Burj Khalifa view. The aquarium at Dubai Mall was likewise amazing . It was such a short stay , am planning my next visit asap!Show morePGuest review byPriscila Maria10.0Dubai is a vibrant, modern city known for its stunning...Dubai is a vibrant, modern city known for its stunning skyscrapers, luxury shopping, and innovative architecture.

The city is super clean, incredibly well structured and highly organised, which for us is really attractive.
All the malls, public toilets are super-clean and smell fresh. We even seen cleaners cleaning "underneath chairs" in a restaurant.
Dubai is a very well managed place, with stable air-con throughout wherever you go, and dare we say, it feels safe.
The only downside we found was the volume of traffic, which for a popular city that's still on the rise, is understandable. However, if you like super-luxury cars then you wont mind being stuck behind or at the side of one, they are in abundance and they are stunning to see.
Overall - Dubai is a stunning city that has etched into our mind.Show moredGuest review bydaukcachUnited Kingdom10.0We loved the boat cruise, entertainment and food and drinks,...We loved the boat cruise, entertainment and food and drinks, the desert advanture, sun dune drive, camel rides, and desert quad bikes was really the highlights of our trip. Many other places we visited like Abu Dhabi and seeing the famous Mosque, the emeritus and the royal palace.
Our disappoint was the so called barbeque dinner at the off the desert outing that’s so disappointing, was nit fresh and was left overs from other earlier tours we suspected and was really bad. Our group was unable to eat the food. Everything they promised in terms of food and drinks was very disappointing.
But besides that everything else we did and food we ate every where else we went was great.Show moreKGuest review byKarenSouth Africa10.0Me and my partner Stayed at Millennium marina and the staff...Me and my partner Stayed at Millennium marina and the staff couldn't of been more helpful if they tried.

The pool bar area was really clean, good music the towel guy was polite and always let us change our towel when it was to wet. The bar staff always there when needed, they even would come to you and take your order there was oy 2 bar staff for at least 50 guest.
