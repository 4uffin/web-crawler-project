With its ultramodern skyscrapers, the artificial archipelago of Palm Islands and the world’s largest shopping mall, Dubai offers something for every taste. Surrounded by a desert, this city is the futuristic gem of the Middle East and the United Arab Emirates. Chic yachts call the city’s upscale marina home, as well as the 30-acre manmade Burj Khalifa Lake and the world's largest dancing Dubai Fountain. With all of this, visitors might momentarily forget they are in a desert. You can relax on a beautiful sandy beach, explore the local souks and their treasures or enjoy a trip to the amazing Dubai Desert. Don’t forget to stop at Burj Khalifa’s observation deck and admire the city panorama from nearly 1500 feet. Dubai has even more to offer: camel races, hot air balloon flights, fast rides over sand dunes and even snow skiing! Make sure you try local cuisine and visit the Spice Souk, famous for its thousand and one spices. Getting to the city center from Dubai International and Sharjah International Airports is easy. Whether you’re looking for a stunning luxury hotel, a beachfront suite or an intimate resort, Booking.com has the perfect place to stay for your Dubai adventure.What Guests Said About Dubai:10.0We loved the boat cruise, entertainment and food and drinks,...We loved the boat cruise, entertainment and food and drinks, the desert advanture, sun dune drive, camel rides, and desert quad bikes was really the highlights of our trip. Many other places we visited like Abu Dhabi and seeing the famous Mosque, the emeritus and the royal palace.
Our disappoint was the so called barbeque dinner at the off the desert outing that’s so disappointing, was nit fresh and was left overs from other earlier tours we suspected and was really bad. Our group was unable to eat the food. Everything they promised in terms of food and drinks was very disappointing.
But besides that everything else we did and food we ate every where else we went was great.Show moreKGuest review byKarenSouth Africa10.0Me and my partner Stayed at Millennium marina and the staff...Me and my partner Stayed at Millennium marina and the staff couldn't of been more helpful if they tried.

The pool bar area was really clean, good music the towel guy was polite and always let us change our towel when it was to wet. The bar staff always there when needed, they even would come to you and take your order there was oy 2 bar staff for at least 50 guest.

From the moment you arrive, you're struck by the seamless blend of ultra-modern architecture and rich cultural heritage. The Burj Khalifa dominates the skyline like a gleaming needle, while the traditional souks in Deira transport you to old Arabia with their fragrant spices and glittering gold.
The city's ambition is infectious – whether you're skiing indoors at Mall of the Emirates, watching the fountain show at Dubai Mall, or taking a desert safari at sunset, everything feels larger than life. The food scene is incredible, from street-side shawarma to world-class fine dining with views that stretch across the Persian Gulf.
What impressed me most was how efficiently everything runs. The metro is spotless and punctual, the malls are architectural marvels, and the hospitality is genuinely warm. Yes, it can feel artificial at times, and the summer heat is brutal, but there's something undeniably magical about this city that rose from the desert in just a few decades.
Dubai isn't just a destination – it's an experience that shows you what's possible when vision meets execution. Whether you're here for business or pleasure, you'll leave with stories that sound too extraordinary to be true.Show moreMGuest review byMarcusSeychelles2.0If you want to waste your money and enjoy the burning...If you want to waste your money and enjoy the burning weather, please go ahead and book.
