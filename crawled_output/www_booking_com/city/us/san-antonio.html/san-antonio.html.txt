RRodneyFromGermanySoo I started  reservation of a room with a travel agency at the Drury Inn and Suites in San Antonio.  The next day after confirming San Antonio, I logged in and completed what I thought was reservation of the room I originally started. Upon arrival, we met your awesome security guy, sorry can't remember his name and after we went inside and checked in. I sent my family to the room to get comfortable while I parked my truck. Upon arrival to the room I found my beautiful wife sitting in a chair inside the room with the curtains opened looking out the window. And I explained, baby we have a balcony and asked why are you inside looking out side. She showed me that we have no balcony. So in a  bit of despair, I looked at the room reservation and it did not Include a balcony. I immediately went to the front desk ad explained how much my wife loves to take pictures and being outdoors and somehow the room/ reservation changed and I did not verify and asked how much to upgrade to a room with a balcony. I felt so bad whatching my wife just looking out a window. Alexis! I hope I spelled her name right listened to me and understood the delima I was in, took a look and said I can get your family in the room you thought you were getting initially at no extra charge. I was blown away. I don't know how you found her and or Renea your assistant GM. All your staff is amazing including your cook. He watched attentively over the food out your kick back 5:30 to 7 pm.  Thank you Alexis and everyone keep it up. My family and I will only stay at Drury Inn and Suites in San Antonio tx if you continue to employee the type of amazing folks we met today!!!
Thank you,

One of the city’s former Spanish missions, the Alamo was the site of a deadly battle that cost folk hero Davy Crockett his life. The other remaining missions - Concepcion, San Jose, San Juan, and Espada with its aqueduct - are dotted around the city. The attractive Spanish Governor’s Palace also remains.The San Antonio River runs right through the city, below street level. Known as the Riverwalk, its banks have been cleverly developed to house riverfront restaurants, bars and shops, and are spectacularly lit for Christmas. There are several San Antonio hotels by the Riverwalk which are also close to the Rivercenter Mall, the city’s biggest shopping center, while La Villita artisan village has more traditional crafts.Across the road in Hemisfair is the Tower of the Americas, a tall observation tower with a revolving restaurant overlooking the Alamodome, a huge sports and convention venue, home to the annual Alamo Bowl collegiate football game. Booking.com has several San Antonio hotels near the Alamodome, and more accommodations near San Antonio Airport.On the outskirts of the city are Sea World and Six Flags Fiesta Texas. The city also hosts the San Antonio Stock Show & Rodeo, one of the country’s biggest Western events.Learn more about visiting San Antonio133 attractions61 points of interest13 neighborhoodsFind out moreWhat Guests Said About San Antonio:10.0The Hop On Hop Off was the most helpful.The Hop On Hop Off was the most helpful.

They all walked you to an area so you could see exactly where we wanted to go. The Alamo and the laser light show was wonderful. The boat ride too was fun.
