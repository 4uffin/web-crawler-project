Though ‘great’ is quite an understatement, as the sight of blue mist hovering above forested peaks is simply breathtaking.The most famous attraction is undoubtedly Dollywood, where a steam train puffs around a host of rides and shows in a theme park named after country legend Dolly Parton. Within the grounds is the Southern Gospel Museum and Hall of Fame, and next door are pools and waterslides at Dolly’s Splash Country.Cowboy boots should be at the ready for the singer’s Dixie Stampede dinner theatre and the Country Tonite Theater, and toe-tapping is also virtually guaranteed at the Grand Majestic Theater and Smoky Mountain Opry.The Old Mill is a wooden watermill on the Little Pigeon River, once part of a forge complex which sparked the town’s name. Also by the river are some Pigeon Forge outlet malls and the NASCAR SpeedPark which hosts car and truck events. The Elvis Museum houses memorabilia of ‘The King’ while the Titanic Museum is a floating, half-size replica of the doomed ship.This is just the tip of the iceberg and with Booking.com’s great deals on pet-friendly hotels and cheap motels on Pigeon Forge Parkway, you might just be tempted to do what the town’s sign requests: Y’all come back.Learn more about visiting Pigeon Forge111 attractions16 points of interestFind out moreWhat Guests Said About Pigeon Forge:8.0Pigeon Forge was very nice even got to see a car show.Pigeon Forge was very nice even got to see a car show.

Traffic is always backed up during that time so, if you are not interested in cars and traffic, check the dates to make sure you are not coming during that time.
