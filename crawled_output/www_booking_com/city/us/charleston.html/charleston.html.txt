With temperatures of 100F and 87% humidity it was too hot to do many of the things we would have liked.
However a carriage ride around the French Quarter, with Palmetto Carriages' knowledgeable driver Elliot, gave us a taste of this historical district.
Would recommend Anson Cafe (actually a big restaurant) near the market.
Lovely food and excellent service.
And of course, the French Quarter Inn.
Spend time in the four buildings of The Market and buy authentic Benne Wafers from Southern Sisters.Show morePGuest review byPatriciaUnited KingdomSee reviews by guests who stayed at hotels in CharlestonSee allFulton Lane InnHistoric District, CharlestonScored out of 10, guest rating 8.98.9Excellent - What previous guests thought, 285 reviews Excellent · 285 reviewsOn reflection I would not stay in Charleston, rather I would stay somewhere outside the old Downtown area, where it's cheeper - $18 for a sandwich, and $8 for bad coffee.
