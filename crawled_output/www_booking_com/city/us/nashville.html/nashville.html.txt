It's sooo crowded now, so many people here for 21st birthdays, bachelorette parties, anniversaries, etc. I'd say there's probably at least a 65/35 ratio of women to men here visiting. Gone are the days of tipping an artist or band 2 or 3 bucks to make a request -- it's a minimum of $20 to get your song considered an more if you want to be sure and have it move higher up in the setlist! BUT if you love live music (more classic rock than country now here) this is the place to be. Most places charge $9 for a beer, 11 for hard seltzer, 14-18 for mixed drinks. BUT there's never a cover charge and never a shortage of entertainment. You won't be disappointed.Show moreJGuest review byJamesUnited States10.0A wonderful town with lots to do and a TON of things to do...A wonderful town with lots to do and a TON of things to do if you've got a car (or want to book a trip on a tour bus).
