My expectations were simple: a place to sleep and somewhere to eat. This hotel has no restaurant but the Shalmar Greek restaurant is a 5 min walk along the high way. I noticed a lugguage trolly by the entrance but there was no bell staff when I checked in and as tired as I was from 7 hours flying, I had to lug my bags up to the 4th floor unassisted. The room was sizeable with a designated sitting area which would have been a great reading spot - had my stay been longer. Check in for me was actually my combined check out also. The full breakfast is complimentary but I had to leave way too early to even consider it. Sunny and Leroy were my two drivers and they put a welcoming face on the complimentary shuttle service Wingate offers.Show moreDGuest review byDonna ChristineBermuda6.0We loved Carowinds had a wonderful time.We loved Carowinds had a wonderful time.
