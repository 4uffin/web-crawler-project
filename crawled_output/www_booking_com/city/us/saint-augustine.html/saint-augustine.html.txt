At night it was so many restaurants with live music, people in good mood, wonderful atmosphere, all was well illuminated-loved it!
The room was very comfortable, modern washroom, high quality shampoo, soap and lotion. Breakfast wasn't included; however, in the morning good coffee was available at reception (room had coffee machine with one-cup bags, we didn't like the taste). The room had a small fridge, so we bought some groceries, added coffee from reception and were happy to start day with a breakfast at the room. Generally, sometime I am ready to pay more for such as location to enjoy atmosphere of a new city.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 8.38.3Very Good - What previous guests thought, 1,005 reviewsVery Good 1,005 reviewsPrice from$1391 night, 2 adultsCheck availabilityComfort Suites St Augustine Historic District AreaHotel in St. AugustineLocated in St. Augustine, 1.2 miles from Freedom Trail, Comfort Suites St Augustine Historic District Area has accommodations with an outdoor swimming pool, private parking, a fitness center and a...KKaterineFromColombiaThe hotel is newest.

We were pleasantly surprised. We chose to go in September which is the "slow" part of the year but it gave us plenty of time to enjoy the city. We took the shuttle from Southern Oaks Inn to the historical district most days. We walked, we shopped, and we enjoyed time being together. We took the "Hop On - Hop Off" shuttle once we were in the historical district. The drivers were knowledgeable and entertaining. We toured the Castillo de San Marcos Fortress, Cathedral Basilica of St. Augustine, and a sunset cruise on the Black Raven. Very enjoyable trip!Show moreDGuest review byDeboraUnited States10.0As a native Floridian, I almost feel embarrassed to admit...As a native Floridian, I almost feel embarrassed to admit that his was my first trip to St. Augustine.
