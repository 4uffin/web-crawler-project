Unfortunately we were just passing through so didn't have much time.
We would love to come back and do more exploring of the cobblestone pedestrian streets with so many shops and places to eat.
Didn't have time for the Old Town Trolley Tour, but the one in Key West was great so I highly recommend it here.
We will if we ever get back.
We did walk through the Castillo de San Marcos.
It was really cool and has a real moat! We had dinner at Meehan's Irish Pub and Seafood House.
It was very good and the wait staff knows what they're doing.
All in all, it was a short but sweet overnight stop.Show moreJGuest review byJessica LBUnited States10.0We have lived in SC for 44 years and had never been to St.We have lived in SC for 44 years and had never been to St. Augustine, FL so we didn't know what to expect. We were pleasantly surprised. We chose to go in September which is the "slow" part of the year but it gave us plenty of time to enjoy the city. We took the shuttle from Southern Oaks Inn to the historical district most days. We walked, we shopped, and we enjoyed time being together. We took the "Hop On - Hop Off" shuttle once we were in the historical district. The drivers were knowledgeable and entertaining. We toured the Castillo de San Marcos Fortress, Cathedral Basilica of St. Augustine, and a sunset cruise on the Black Raven. Very enjoyable trip!Show moreDGuest review byDeboraUnited States10.0As a native Floridian, I almost feel embarrassed to admit...As a native Floridian, I almost feel embarrassed to admit that his was my first trip to St. Augustine.
