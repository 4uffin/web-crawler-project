We Love Atlanta!!!! 10/10 ❤️❤️❤️Show moreNGuest review byNatalieUnited States10.0I stayed at this hotel from August 17–20, 2025, while...I stayed at this hotel from August 17–20, 2025, while attending an international academic conference in Atlanta. My overall experience was good, and I am very grateful to the staff for their warm hospitality and dedication.
Warm Service – The front desk staff were friendly, attentive, and always willing to help. The breakfast and housekeeping teams were also hardworking and welcoming, creating a pleasant atmosphere throughout my stay.
Perfect Location – The hotel is ideally located, just 3–5 minutes’ walk to the subway and the conference venue. Major attractions such as the Georgia Aquarium, World of Coca-Cola, museums, and libraries are also within walking distance. The area is lively, with many restaurants and convenient public transport options.
Comfortable Stay – My room was clean, with fresh linens, a comfortable adjustable air conditioner, and a spotless bathroom. The elevator worked smoothly, and I felt at ease during my stay. If the shower water pressure could be a little stronger, it would make the experience even better.
Delicious Breakfast & Great Amenities – The breakfast was plentiful, fresh, and tasty, definitely a highlight of my stay! The complimentary lemon ice water in the lobby was also a thoughtful touch. Most importantly, the Wi-Fi was fast and reliable, which was very convenient for work and research.
Safety – While there were some homeless individuals nearby, I felt safe in the area. Just a small note to avoid walking alone late at night.
Overall, this was a positive and memorable stay. With its excellent location, warm service, comfortable room, delicious breakfast, and fast Wi-Fi, I would be happy to return and will gladly recommend this hotel to friends and colleagues visiting Atlanta.Show moreMGuest review byMan-JuTaiwan2.0there was no air conditioning.
