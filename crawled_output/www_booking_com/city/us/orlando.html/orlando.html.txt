Uber and Lift are easily available but we prefer to have our own car for ease of use. The cost of car hire has
fallen so it is not as expensive as it was just after covid.
We did find that the cost of food in the supermarkets and restaurants has risen since our last visit, quite substantially in some places.
There do not seem to be the buffet style eateries which were always such good value for a quick stop meal, I‚Äôm guessing most have now closed down which is sad.
Anyone planning a theme park trip will already know the tickets aren‚Äôt cheap! However there are good combinations to be had and strangely it seems the longer you buy tickets for the better value they are, even if it means you don‚Äôt use every day up. Food and drink in the parks is expensive but water stations are freely available to refill bottles.Show moreTGuest review byTraceyUnited Kingdom10.0My daughter and I love Orlando.My daughter and I love Orlando.

This particular visit was a bucket list vacation gift from my dad for our family. We visited Disney World & Universal Studios for a week.
The new EPIC park at Universal Studios is a smaller park, but a definite & exciting must see.
It was easy to get around Orlando, however, there are lots of toll roads and traffic peak times vary.
The rainy weather can put a damper on certain outdoor activities and rides at the theme parks but there are always lots of indoor activities until the rain subsides.
There's lots of local shopping, restaurants, souvenir shops and site seeing to do. Along International Drive, near the convention center, there are lots of places to visit like ICON Park for The Wheel, Madame Tussauds Wax Museum, the SEA LIFE Aquarium, Topgolf, WonderWorks and Ripley's Believe It or Not! Cocoa Beach and other beaches are not too far off the beaten path.
There's fun for every age.
I will warn you to check with the visitor's center to ask when the European crowd will be in Orlando. Their school breaks are very different than our typical American summer and holiday breaks; and their presence can affect crowd sizes and wait times.
Orlando is packed with fun and adventure for families, couples or solo travelers.
So plan a trip and have fun!
