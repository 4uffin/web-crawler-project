the parking routine was not very friendly for the guests.
Need automated or allow the guest to pre-register the vehicle before they arrive.
Need to simplify the process.
Also, as a person that does not have pets, it is not very attractive watching people walk their dogs on the property to do their business.

There was a roach on my headboard and when I killed it and brought it to the front desk, they said, "a bug is a bug" and were extremely unprofessional regarding the issue, even suggesting that it was bout online and put in the room!
The halls and pool were filthy. Once I changed rooms, with no assistance, the new room reeked of cigarette smoke. The pool was filthy, so much hair floating around. People were allowed to smoke everywhere on the property. I was in awe of the state of the hotel and how little the front desk manager cared. Not only will I never stay there again, I am going to report this to all agencies applicable.Show moreAGuest review byAnonymousSee reviews by guests who stayed at hotels in Myrtle BeachSee allBermuda Sands On The BoardwalkMyrtle BeachFrom $62.50 per nightScored out of 10, guest rating 6.16.1Pleasant - What previous guests thought, 2,278 reviews PleasantÂ Â·Â 2,278 reviewsIt was my daughter spring break..
