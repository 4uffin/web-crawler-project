the parking routine was not very friendly for the guests.

Need to simplify the process.

There was a roach on my headboard and when I killed it and brought it to the front desk, they said, "a bug is a bug" and were extremely unprofessional regarding the issue, even suggesting that it was bout online and put in the room!
The halls and pool were filthy. Once I changed rooms, with no assistance, the new room reeked of cigarette smoke. The pool was filthy, so much hair floating around. People were allowed to smoke everywhere on the property. I was in awe of the state of the hotel and how little the front desk manager cared. Not only will I never stay there again, I am going to report this to all agencies applicable.Show moreAGuest review byAnonymous10.0The umbrellas on the beach (if you can afford them) is a...The umbrellas on the beach (if you can afford them) is a pleasure.
