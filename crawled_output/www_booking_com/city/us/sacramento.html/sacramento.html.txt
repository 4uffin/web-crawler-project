Like in classic Westerns, horses pull covered wagons past a wooden boardwalk linking covered shopfronts. The blossoming Californian capital attracted more than one kind of pioneer though. The Big Four entrepeneurs devised the Central Pacific Railroad, as detailed in the State Railroad Museum. The Eagle Theatre was the state’s first, on a considerably smaller scale than the modern-day arts venues showcasing everything from opera to ballet.A paddle steamer is moored on the nearby Sacramento River, and the American River Parkway lines the city’s other river, opposite the first settlement site. The founder created Sutter’s Fort, and the State Indian Museum documents the native people that lived there long before. Despite such mass immigration, Sacramento is surprisingly well integrated, but with that glorious Californian sun, it’s easy to see why the locals are so laidback. Palm trees shade streets including Capitol Mall, connecting the State Capitol to Tower Bridge. The nearby Crocker Art Museum is the oldest museum in the western US, while historic figures are remembered in the California Hall of Fame.Booking.com’s accommodation options include apartments near the convention centre, cheap motels and Sacramento Airport hotels.What Guests Said About Sacramento:10.0I wish I would have planned to stay longer, The downtown and...I wish I would have planned to stay longer, The downtown and riverfront area looked fantastic. I was able to spend a morning paddling at Fulsom Lake, which was a short drive from the hotel, and it was just spectacular. Highly recommend, and I am planning a visit back for sure.Show moreMGuest review byMichaelUnited States8.0There is a lot to do in downtown Sacramento with plenty of...There is a lot to do in downtown Sacramento with plenty of restaurants and events on the weekends. Maneuvering around the city is a little tricky when it is crowded (it was when we were there), but it was manageable. We were there for SacAnime at the SAFE Credit Union Convention Center and the Monet Experience. We also dropped in on Old Sacramento for a quick visit and some salt water taffy. We did witness a few homeless camps as we drove around.
Traffic on the freeways can be a bit hectic, so make sure you know where you’re going.Show moreBGuest review byBarbaraUnited States2.0Sacramento has turned into a dirty dirty city full of drug...Sacramento has turned into a dirty dirty city full of drug addicts and hookers homeless everywhere going to the bathroom and doing drugs our state capital the governor should be ashamed the major should be fired and replaced it has gone down hill and has turned into a dumpShow moredGuest review bydeborrello10.0My first visit to Sacramento and was not disappointed at all...My first visit to Sacramento and was not disappointed at all.

Night got cooler to walk around. In Old Town area, I would recommend with a group.
The night scene is a little more rowdy.
Many people were e-scooting around.
Younger crowd.
Walked early morning, which was cooler and less congested.
Crocker Art museum, Leland Stanford Mansion both were not open since it was around 8am.
Had visited last year so didn't
walk the Capital area, stayed closer to the Sac River and Old Town. Enjoyed watching a ballgame with the River Cats at Sutter Health stadium, even had fireworks that night and was a special Harry Potter theme.Show moreKGuest review byKarenUnited States8.0I really didn’t get out much in the city as I was there...I really didn’t get out much in the city as I was there limited amount of time for a concert and left early in the morning.
