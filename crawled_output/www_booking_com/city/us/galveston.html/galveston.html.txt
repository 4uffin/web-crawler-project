There are alot of good restaurants around and hotels.
If you like to fish, you have your choice of some great baitshops.
Blvd Seafood on the Seawall is a great place to eat & Rudy & Pico has really good lunch specials.
Maceos also has really good lunches.
The island has alot of transportation, such as trolleys, uber & lyft.
Because Galveston is a island, you will see homeless people.
During events, there are alot of people having a good time, but it's best to uber or lyft.Show moreJGuest review byJackie10.0We don't live in Galveston but have lived nearby our whole...We don't live in Galveston but have lived nearby our whole lives.
We tend to take it for granted.
Of course there are more beautiful beaches, but Galveston is full of a lifetime of memories for us, so we love it.
After school starts, it's a perfect place to spend a weekend.
Full of southern charm and stories about pirates and wiseguys, it's a fun place to get to know BOTIs (born on the island) and newcomers.
Not to mention the great seafood and fishing.
And our beloved dreadnought, The Battleship Texas, BB35, will be permanently moored there next year.
Something for everyone.Show moreJGuest review byJulieUnited States10.0Galveston is a fun place to visit.Galveston is a fun place to visit. Its a short drive to the Ferry to Bolivar and Crystal beach. There are several good restaurants to choose from. The only downfall is that you have to pay to park along the seawall. We ate at the Golden coral and although it is a small one compared to others the variety was still good.Show moreKGuest review byKimberley8.0Easy access to the beach.Easy access to the beach. Plenty of things along the seawall to do and see. People were friendly and informative. Historical museums were cool. The dolphin boat tour and haunted boat tours by dolphin bay watch were awesome. Watch out where you park though, if its before 6pm make sure you pay through app or kiosk. I saw cars with tickets so be careful and set alarms so you make sure you are back at your vehicle on time or just extend your time that's what we did. Like that traffic wasn't horrible. Easy to get everywhere. We had a great time on our anniversary.Show moreSGuest review bySandraUnited States10.0We love Galveston!We love Galveston!
