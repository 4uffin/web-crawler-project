In its heart, next to 18th-century Faneuil Hall, is Quince Market - a food haven. In the nearby seaport, you can take a whale-watching trip or dine at one of the many restaurants serving a Boston specialty: lobster with melted butter. The streets south of the peaceful Charles River in Back Bay are lined with Victorian brownstone houses. At the downtown end of one – Beacon Street – is the Cheers bar, modeled on the 80's sitcom. Opposite is Boston Common, a large park with a bronze sculpture celebrating the book "Make Way for Ducklings". The golden dome of the House of Representatives is by the other end. The oldest part is Charlestown and streets around the Bunker Hill obelisk still feature old-style gas lamps, though now they are electric. Over in Cambridge, Harvard is the USA’s oldest and most prestigious university. The campus is open to the public, as is Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), whose central point is an emblematic, Pantheon-like building.Sport in Boston is also a big thing, with the Celtics and Red Sox among the city’s big name teams.The largest New England city, Boston has the perfect size for walking and cycling. Logan International Airport is connected by public transport to Boston hotels, motels, apartments and B&Bs.Learn more about visiting Boston427 attractions69 points of interest19 neighborhoodsFind out moreWhat Guests Said About Boston:10.0Seriously….the best city break ever!Seriously….the best city break ever!

There are so many things to see and so many interesting buildings, people, artwork, architecture, parks, etc. that you could really enjoy this city endlessly. It is calm and serene in the early morning, bustling and exciting in the a.m. as people go to work, it remains exciting throughout the day. The nighttime is a whole new environment with reflections of buildings on water features and rivers and marquees and signs and nightlife lighting up ... and as the night dies down and the crowds die down, the peace returns. There are all kinds of hardworking people moving about all throughout the day. People are walking dogs, lots of students. Lots of international students and visitors and residents - you hear the conversations - it is exciting and reminiscent of Europe. There are parts of Boston that feel like Europe and other parts that are very cutting edge. There seems to be lots of live music, lots of cafes, lots of food choices and many places to shop; you can get almost anything you need or want in this city. It's a fantastic city.
