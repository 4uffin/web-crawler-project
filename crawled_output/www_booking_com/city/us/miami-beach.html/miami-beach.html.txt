Popular as a spring break destination, its miles of pristine sands shelve gently into the turquoise Atlantic Ocean.Lining the beach are tall palm trees and the promenade, famous for the beautiful people that go rollerblading by. Add to this a warm, subtropical climate and you can see why many
celebrities have chosen to set up home in Miami Beach.You might even spot some of them shopping in the designer boutiques along Lincoln Road. And if your budget doesn’t quite stretch that far, there’s still a great range of shops with more moderate prices, including Aventura Mall and CocoWalk.The city also has its fair share of culture, including the Art Deco District, which houses the world’s largest collection of Art Deco architecture, including some of the brightly-lit Miami Beach hotels on Ocean Drive. Comprising a series of islands just across Biscayne Bay from Miami (the route you take from Miami Airport), this city has a heavy Latin American influence, which is evident in the cuisine and fantastic nightlife. Whether you choose Miami Beach accommodations in the North Beach, Mid Beach or South Beach areas, a Cuba Libre - rum and coke - is never far away.Learn more about visiting Miami Beach852 attractions21 points of interest6 neighborhoodsFind out moreWhat Guests Said About Miami Beach:10.0It was good we rented a jeep instead of the mustang...It was good we rented a jeep instead of the mustang convertible. Which was recommended by the car rental place due to lots of rain before we arrived and flooding. The weather ended up really nice and we still were able to ride with the top down. I learned to uber to and from the rental car building from the airport because its a long walk!
Uber/Lyft was less expensive than a cab.
It's also a 2.5 mile walk if you are going to Uber to the Dolphins game. Getting in wasn't bad but leaving was horrible. Got great ticket prices on stub hub an hour before the game.

It is very hot and humid and very unpleasant to walk around and be a tourist in the summer time in Miami Beach. The beaches are lovely if that's what you like to do, just like the Gold Coast in Australia. Miami Beach is quite a distance from everything.There is a free trolley service to get around,
but all the locals use it and it gets very crowded when it is knock off time. We used Lyft or Uber to get around but none of the drivers speak English. There are no cafes, supermarkets or reasonably priced restaurants around the hotel. So if you want to eat locally the only options are inside each of the hotels and everything is $$$Show moreDGuest review byDanutaAustraliaSee reviews by guests who stayed at hotels in Miami BeachSee allThe Fritz HotelMiami BeachFrom $140.21 per nightScored out of 10, guest rating 8.08.0Very Good - What previous guests thought, 569 reviews Very Good · 569 reviewsThe location is perfect, right overlooking south beach on Ocean Drive, Lovely Art Deco building ( a little tired, but is classed as a 3 star ) front desk/host were amazing, early check in, late check out were both granted without fuss.
