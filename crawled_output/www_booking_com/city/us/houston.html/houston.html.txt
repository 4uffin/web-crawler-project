The 4th largest US city, it is home to NASA’s Johnson Space Center where Mission Control is located. Of course, this is not its only claim to fame. This is Texas after all, where everything is big.Houston’s Reliant Astrodome was the world’s first indoor sports stadium under a domed roof, and the Galleria is the largest mall in Texas. The city’s Livestock Show and Rodeo is the largest in the world, and the JP Morgan Chase Tower is the planet’s tallest 5-sided building. The list goes on. Amid the skyscrapers of the thriving CBD is the Toyota Center, home of the city’s NBA and AHL teams. The theatre district is also in the downtown area, whereas the museum district is concentrated to the north-east of Hermann Park, home of a boating lake, nature reserve and miniature railway. Also here is Houston Zoo, and just west is Rice University, one of several in the city.The bohemian Rice Village is popular with students, as are the city’s historic pubs and leafy parks. Houston also has no shortage of restaurants or accommodation options. Those on Booking.com include motels, apartments and hotels near George Bush Airport.Learn more about visiting Houston182 attractions84 points of interest21 neighborhoodsFind out moreWhat Guests Said About Houston:10.0Houston has always been my choice in USA because of the...Houston has always been my choice in USA because of the weather and friendly people.

Over $120.00 for parking. This is atrocious, hell there were parking areas half the disrance away, for $10.00 It is bad enough to place people with disabilities where you can screw them, but to do this to a Combat Veteran with disabilities is a show of your greed.
