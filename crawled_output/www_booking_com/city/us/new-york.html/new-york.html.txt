The city is huge if you include Brooklyn and the other suburbs so if you wanted to do everything you'd need at least a week. The city is constantly humming and is generally really busy so it has a good vibe but can be a bit much if you're not used to that sort of thing. You will also end up doing a lot of walking. Overall, the history of the place is amazing and there is so much to do and see and loads of amazing places to eat and drink so there's something for everyone.Show moreGGuest review byGregScottUnited Kingdom10.0We spent a few days in New York City, and it truly lived up...We spent a few days in New York City, and it truly lived up to the hype. The energy is unmatched – from the chaos of Times Square to the unexpected calm of Central Park. I visited iconic landmarks like the Empire State Building, the Brooklyn Bridge, and the Statue of Liberty, but also wandered through character-filled neighborhoods like SoHo,Little Italy, China Town...
The food was a highlight – classic New York pizza, fresh bagels, and an incredible variety of international cuisine. Public transportation was surprisingly efficient, though it can be a bit overwhelming at first.
In just a few days, New York managed to amaze us. It's a city that never sleeps and never stops surprising you. We’ll definitely be coming back.Show morePGuest review byPopaRomania10.0Favorite Sport and activities : Walking in streets, Central...Favorite Sport and activities : Walking in streets, Central Park, MOMA, Chelsea, Brooklyn bridge, Ellis Island, 5th Avenue.
