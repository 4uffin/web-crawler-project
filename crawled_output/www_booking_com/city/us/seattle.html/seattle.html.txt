Positives - I had heard there was a major homeless problem here, but we did not encounter much at all near the tourist areas were we stayed.
Pretty place on the water with many options to do like taking a ferry to Bainbridge, Pike Market and the 3 attraction spaced close together by Space Needle.
Negative - The food was soooo overpriced where $25 burgers are the norm.
Service fees really irked me where you receive your bill and there is a mandatory 5% service fee that states this does not go to the server but is used for rising costs (then add it to the prices instead of doing it this way).Show moreMGuest review byMichaelUnited States10.0Wondeful places to visit including plke street market,...Wondeful places to visit including plke street market, flowers fish and totally unique stalls and shops.

The city has an easy style, a little like a chilled version of New York.
A local told us much of the greenery along the promenade is new, part of the revamp ahead of hosting the World Cup, and it really added to the charm of our walk.
If you love fish, you’ll love Seattle. Fresh seafood is everywhere, from casual bites to fine dining, and it’s always on the menu. We rounded off our visit with an evening at the Old Stove, which is definitely worth a visit.Show moreTGuest review byTracyUnited KingdomSee reviews by guests who stayed at hotels in SeattleSee allThe Sound Hotel Seattle Belltown, Tapestry CollectionBelltown, SeattleScored out of 10, guest rating 8.98.9Excellent - What previous guests thought, 428 reviews Excellent · 428 reviewsVery good location.
