Santa Monica Pier is the end point of the fabled Route 66, while just south is bohemian Venice Beach, lined by tall, swaying palms. Go slightly inland from the boardwalk to catch a
glimpse of the canals that earned the area its name.Head north to the golden beach and stunning scenery of Malibu and see why movie stars over the decades have settled here. Also popular with the rich and famous are Bel Air and Beverly Hills, home to exclusive Rodeo Drive.And the reason for all this glitz and glamour? Hollywood, of course! Sitting high on a hill, the iconic sign is visible for miles around, while below the gold stars on Hollywood Boulevard immortalize celebrities of past and present.  Be there on premiere night to see them grace the red carpet of Grauman’s Chinese Theater.Over the hill is Universal Studios, with behind-the-scenes tours as well as rides. Next door are the Warner Brothers Studios, and Paramount Studios are closer to Downtown LA.Whether you decide to live like a star in a luxury LA hotel or choose a cheap motel through Booking.com, it’s worth renting a car to get around this sprawling city and out to Los Angeles Airport (LAX).Learn more about visiting Los Angeles1406 attractions107 points of interest27 neighborhoodsFind out moreWhat Guests Said About Los Angeles:10.0Los Angeles is a wonderful place to visit, especially in the...Los Angeles is a wonderful place to visit, especially in the Fall through Spring (Oct-March), but much like the postcards you find at gift shops on Hollywood Boulevard, the view is not always as picture-perfect in between those iconic shots. L.A., in particular, has its contrasting images. The filth, graffiti, and rundown properties are not so well hidden from sight.
Los Angeles does a better job than most cities at showcasing its glitz and glamour, so be prepared to see less of one and more of the other. It's in those spaces between where much of L.A.'s magic can be discovered with its people, places, and things to do.Show moreDGuest review byDennisUnited States4.0Thus far, getting in/out of LAX has been worse than any...Thus far, getting in/out of LAX has been worse than any airport.

Central Los Angeles is full of homeless people and dirty streets, which made me sad. Other than that it's a multicultural city with a fascinating history. I wouldn't recommend visiting in the summer, though: heat and humidity are unbearable; there are repairs and diversions on the bus routes and public services seem to work slower. All in all, I enjoyed my stay, I would definitely come back.

Hollywood itself is smaller than it looks on TV so you can easily get to everything. At night you can go to the very historic Chinese Theater and see a movie as well as take a tour during the day. Plenty of places to eat and all prices. You can rent a driverless Waymo car to go to Paramount Studios for about $12 it was a lot of fun and very safe.
Tour was great.
Cons-dirty, trash everywhere and people sleeping on the street that you have to step around. The Walgreens right by the Dolby Theater where they hold
the OSCARS got robbed of a case of drinks about noon. People were shouting "thief, thief". There's no police presence whatsoever.Show moreMGuest review byMargaretUnited States8.0So much to see and do.
Fantastic museums.So much to see and do.
Fantastic museums.
Would go to many again and again if I could.
Favorites are La Brea Tar Pits (a gem!!! way under appreciated), the Huntington in Pasadena (gardens and the art collections!!!), the Petersen Automotive Museum and the Vault underneath it (separate ticket fee, but worth it), and the Getty's (2).
Many more but those we've visited already and plan to visit again.
We also have enjoyed seeing the sites (locations around LA) that have featured prominently in our favorite series (Bosch).
Many great destinations featured and fun to see a couple more each time we come thru LA.Show moreDGuest review byDeanSee reviews by guests who stayed at hotels in Los AngelesSee allThe Beverly Laurel Hotel at West HollywoodFairfax District, Los AngelesFrom $338.85 per nightScored out of 10, guest rating 8.08.0Very Good - What previous guests thought, 2,278 reviews Very Good · 2,278 reviewsNice hotel in a central location near the Grove.
