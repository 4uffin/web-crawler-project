The people we met were all very nice and welcoming, even giving us suggestions on places to eat that we might not have thought about because they were not on Duval St.
We really enjoyed the trip to Sunset Key and dinner at Latitudes to watch the sunset.

The eggs and sausage were terrible, really not worth putting out if that is the quality and effort that going to be used .
Eggs were like soup, the “ham “ looked like something found on a Little Ceasers Pizza or cheaper .
For the money this hotel (and others) gouge! people for a place to sleep
put
a little more effort into the “hot” breakfast portion or just leave it out.
