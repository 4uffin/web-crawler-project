There is a nice street alongside the airport that I love, I walked it in the morning to get downtown. The staff were so friendly and amazing, there was a nice fellow at the bar who was great with small talk when serving the complimentary drinks. The breakfast was out of this world !! My room was a king suite, it was clean and fresh, the staff was available incase I needed anything at all like more cups and they respected my "do not disturb" sign in the mornings. Ultimately, I had THE best time.
