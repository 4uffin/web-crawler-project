Spreading along the white sandy beaches and supported by the strong back of the volcanic mountains, it's a real island paradise.Honolulu's most popular and famous district, Waikiki, features the stunning Waikiki Beach decorated with hundreds of surfboards, palms and lounge chairs. It’s also a center for the city’s nightlife and shopping, especially along Kalakaua and Kuhio Avenues.As the most popular activities in Honolulu include surfing, snorkeling, canoeing and other water sports, it's no surprise the city has a number of sandy beaches. Try Hanauma Bay, a crescent-shaped beach with rolling, green hills behind it.For fans of hiking and exploring, nature awaits at Diamond Head Mountain, a volcanic tuff cone where you can admire the panoramic view of the city. There is also the Bishop Museum with the world’s largest collection of Hawaiian and Pacific artifacts and the Waikiki Aquarium with over 490 species of marine fauna and flora.From hotels near Honolulu International Airport to hotels near the beach, Booking.com has plenty of properties, from cheap to luxury, for your Honolulu trip.Learn more about visiting Honolulu418 attractions47 points of interest6 neighborhoodsFind out moreWhat Guests Said About Honolulu:8.0We only spent one night in Waikiki area, but it was...We only spent one night in Waikiki area, but it was considerably busier than the many other places we've been around the islands. Reminded me of Shibuya or Osaka (also in part due to affluence of Japanese tourists). We didn't visit many amenities but the beach at Waikiki was quite packed, even though we went there around 8 AM on a Monday in September (three lines of parties at all times). No major complain but not exactly the impression/expectation of the islands.Show moreMGuest review byMiguelSpain8.0I think the biggest thing was the cost - the prices of food...I think the biggest thing was the cost - the prices of food and general goods have tripled since our last visit most people we spoke to said the same - I would say the visitor numbers were down possibly due to this - tours and experiences were expensive - the locals also said the same how they are struggling to live day to day.
The plastic used in Hawaii was excessive - there was nothing environmental about the place at all I did see some wildlife with lost legs and one bird had fishing twine and a bead wrapped around its leg - the poor thing was shivering but unfortunately I couldn't help it.Show moreJGuest review byJenniferNew Zealand10.0Great place to holiday with
