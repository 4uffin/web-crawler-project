We felt safe walking late at night. There were some mental heath homeless people at night. But durning the day we did not see anyone sketchy.
Everyone was pleasant and friendly. We has a car and were able to see other areas that were not as well kept as Anaheim. It would have been nice to have more time to see more of the area.Show moresGuest review bystevenUnited States10.0All ranges of accommodation from 5-star to hostels and are...All ranges of accommodation from 5-star to hostels and are central to both the Convention Center and Disneyland. A 5-10
minute walk to get to a restaurant, bus, or convenience store. Temperate year round. Layer clothing from mid October to mid March. Easy, quick access to all the beaches and the mountains; Hollywood, Palm Springs; and every micro climate and cultures that richly define southern California!Show moreRGuest review byRichardUnited States4.0If you are going for Disney Land, then it will be fun, but...If you are going for Disney Land, then it will be fun, but there is not much else to do here, there are some outlets but with traffic it took us almost 2 hours to make it back to the hotel. We mainly ate at Disney, and we did grub hub food 2 nights. If you are going to Disney and not staying within walking distance to the parks, there is a city shuttle that you can take but be warned, IT TAKES FOREVER to drive by some of the hotels, the drivers are very nice and helpful but we spent alot of time waiting for the shuttle to come by and pick us up, so just be prepared.Show moreLGuest review byLauraUnited States10.0EVERYTHING was PERFECT!!!

We did Star Wars night at Disneyland after taking a 1 1/2 hr nap late in the afternoon as it lasts to 1AM. So much FUN!!! Its 5 miles from Knott's Berry Farm which takes a full day to do with much less people & shorter lines--like 12 minutes max!!
