We could see the Matterhorn ride from our window, and we could see the fireworks at night. It was so nice to be able to come and go as we needed.
We love the Home 2 Suites because of the amazing kitchenette!
We had Walmart delivery groceries to us the first night. So easy! The kitchenette allowed us to keep groceries and eat a cheaper meal each day than in the parks. We had the dishes and utensils we needed, and plenty of space to store our food.
We had 6 big drawers for our clothes, and a open closet space to hang things. The table on wheels made a perfect spot for the kids to eat while sitting on the couch. We were very comfortable.
The beds were comfy, too! One of the first times I haven't been sore from a hotel mattress.
The complimentary breakfast was amazing with lots of options! The staff was amazing in the breakfast area and at the front desk.
