We loved Mel’s diner with the singing servers!!!They were all so talented and sweet! The Christian bookstore
behind Mel’s diner was a great find with a wonderful selection of gifts. The 50’s diner with the drive in behind and the jukebox was a hit. It was like stepping back in time.

There is so much to do in the area including: music/variety/magic shows, museums, several shopping centers, souvenir shops, mini-golf, go-carts, a wide variety of quality restaurants, the original ferris-wheel from the Navy Pier in Chicago, Historic Downtown Branson, zoos, the Branson Belle Dinner Cruise Showboat, Silver Dollar City Amusement Park....among many other attractions.
There is a wide variety of accommodations to choose from as well, from inexpensive budget motels to high-end luxury hotels...along with condos, town-homes, B&Bs and VRBOs.
The only downside (for me) is that there are only a handful (or less) of local, "neighborhood-type" bars that aren't part of a larger restaurant. In fact, I've only found 3...and they're kind-of "hidden gems".Show morePGuest review byParrotHeadUnited States10.0Branson is a family-friendly city that we bring our family...Branson is a family-friendly city that we bring our family to again and again. This trip we spent two days at Silver Dollar City and one day at White Water. We also enjoyed checking out the rocks, beads, and jewelry at the Plum Bazaar in downtown Branson and going to the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe production by the Truth Travelers. On other trips, we've also enjoyed mini-golfing at Coral Reefs, visiting Branson Landing, Dick's 5 and 10, Moonshine Beach, the fish hatchery, Fritz's Adventure, Hurts Donuts, Tanger Outlets, Sight and Sound, and more.Show moreBGuest review byBrettUnited StatesSee reviews by guests who stayed at hotels in BransonSee allSavannah House HotelBransonFrom $132.64 per nightScored out of 10, guest rating 8.88.8Excellent - What previous guests thought, 1,409 reviews Excellent · 1,409 reviewsThe staff was sooo helpful and friendly.
