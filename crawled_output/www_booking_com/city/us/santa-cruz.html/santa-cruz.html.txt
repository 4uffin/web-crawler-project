It's a converted Victorian house.
Our room was so comfy and spacious.
They had fresh baked cookies when we arrived and more throughout the day.
They also had a homemade breakfast- it was a breakfast quiche.
It felt more like a B&B than a hotel.
Friendly staff.
Had a blast and wished we could stay longer.
