And none better than the zig-zag Lombard Street, seen in many a film. Even more famous are San Fran's iconic trolleys climbing the hills – a little touristy, but still worth a ride.In the middle of the bay, Alcatraz island is known for the notorious criminals once imprisoned there. Even if you don’t go inside, the views of the bridge and city are unparalleled.Nowhere is life in San Francisco more laid-back than on the Pacific beaches. Rent a bike and head out there, passing through the huge Golden Gate Park, before returning to sample some fresh seafood at Fisherman’s Wharf. Don't miss the clam chowder served in bread bowls! Chinatown also has a great selection of mid-range restaurants.As you fly into San Francisco Airport, look out for the exclusive homes lining the Bay Area. Whether you want a more independent stay in apartments, luxury San Francisco hotels or cheap hostels, Booking.com has something for everyone. Be careful though – you might just leave your heart here!Learn more about visiting San Francisco770 attractions80 points of interest30 neighborhoodsFind out moreWhat Guests Said About San Francisco:8.0great city.great city.

The bad can be offset with personal attention to the areas where one goes and what one does when reacting to difficult physical and social circumstances
The city offers much to the visitor, especially history, art, science, ... , and a practicle experience in "social justice."
The bounds wealth and poverty are experienced and everything inbetween to the caring observer.

Ferry building area is hopping as well.Show moreKGuest review byKazzUnited States8.0It was cleaner than expected and felt safer than expected...It was cleaner than expected and felt safer than expected based on news the last few years. We heard that current mayor is trying to get things turned around. There were a lot of empty stores downtown, but shopping was better than expected. Still has some of the great restaurants from our visits many years ago - Scomas, Tadich Grill, Stinking Rose. It is still an interesting and beautiful city in many ways. The transportation to get around is still interesting with cable cars, trolleys and trains, and we felt safe. The hills are a challenge for walking great distances in a hurry. There are so many neighborhoods to explore, each with their own vibe. Loved the Italian area and sought out Graffeo Coffee Roasters, which is great! We had some great coffee at the Bohemian Cigar Store & Cafe. Best coffee ever in the Italian sense. We love the Buena Vista Bar was still there and serves a great breakfast (recommended by firemen) as well as their wonderful Irish coffee. We had a lovely meal with beautiful view and good food at McCormick & Schmick’s at Ghirardelli Square. Magnin Street Cafe & Bistro was a fun find. We ate there 2 evenings. Loved the Bistro Boudin on the Wharf. The food and service were great. Unexpected. Beautiful dining above the bakery area. Serve lunch and dinner. Had a view as well. The weather was almost perfect. Just beautiful in early September!Show moreAGuest review byAnonymous10.0San Francisco is one of my favorite places to visit but be...San Francisco is one of my favorite places to visit but be careful which hotels you choose because there's alot of scammers in the city.
