A museum and his former home in nearby Salinas can be visited.The fantastic Monterey Bay Aquarium houses a fascinating range of local sealife, which is so prevalent here that you can often see seals basking on craggy beaches, or sea lions roaring away under piers in Fisherman’s Wharf. Whalewatching tours also depart from here.South is the Monterey State Historic Park, site of historic buildings including Custom House and the Old Whaling Station with a path made from whalebone.
