Located in the heart of the Nevada desert, this city is called the Entertainment Capital of the World for a reason. You can stroll down Fremont Street in old Las Vegas like a member of the Rat Pack or act like a modern high-roller at Caesar’s Palace. Prepare for a long night as the neon lights of clubs and casinos will tempt you to sink into the world of gambling and music. Las Vegas is renowned of its fine dining, great shopping and live performances of famous artists and comedians. Right from the moment you leave McCarran International Airport you can try your luck at a slot machine, but you might want to wait until you get to the Las Vegas strip and the dozens of larger than life casinos. When you’re ready for a break from the bustle of the city, visit the nearby Hoover Dam with the largest man-made lake, Lake Mead. The Paiute Indian Reservation in Vegas’ downtown area offers something a bit more spiritual. Whichever type of accommodation you choose, whether a skyscraper hotel or a design city apartment, you’ll never run out of fantastic activities in Sin City. Booking.com has the perfect place to stay for your Vegas vacation.Learn more about visiting Las Vegas974 attractions77 points of interest11 neighborhoodsFind out moreWhat Guests Said About Las Vegas:8.0Vegas was fantastic and a real experience.Vegas was fantastic and a real experience. The cost of everything is astronomical and if you're planning on doing it on a budget, you will really struggle. You really need to take Uber or Taxis everywhere to see the full city. Plan for $20 minimum taxi fare. The people were so friendly and lovely and we were made to feel so welcome by all. The only rude people were other tourists. The High Roller, Zipline and Freemont Street are definitely worth the money.
