Located in the heart of the Nevada desert, this city is called the Entertainment Capital of the World for a reason. You can stroll down Fremont Street in old Las Vegas like a member of the Rat Pack or act like a modern high-roller at Caesar’s Palace. Prepare for a long night as the neon lights of clubs and casinos will tempt you to sink into the world of gambling and music. Las Vegas is renowned of its fine dining, great shopping and live performances of famous artists and comedians. Right from the moment you leave McCarran International Airport you can try your luck at a slot machine, but you might want to wait until you get to the Las Vegas strip and the dozens of larger than life casinos. When you’re ready for a break from the bustle of the city, visit the nearby Hoover Dam with the largest man-made lake, Lake Mead. The Paiute Indian Reservation in Vegas’ downtown area offers something a bit more spiritual. Whichever type of accommodation you choose, whether a skyscraper hotel or a design city apartment, you’ll never run out of fantastic activities in Sin City. Booking.com has the perfect place to stay for your Vegas vacation.Learn more about visiting Las Vegas977 attractions77 points of interest11 neighborhoodsFind out moreWhat Guests Said About Las Vegas:2.0Las Vegas was dirty and dingy.Las Vegas was dirty and dingy.

Walked over to NY NY and ate in THE AMERICAN where the breakfast was affordable and they served great hash browns. - - - The best comment we can make about the Park MGM is it is smoke free as we no longer will tolerate the death of cigarette smoke in the air.Show moreBGuest review byBob J10.0Vegas is filth dressed up in gold.Vegas is filth dressed up in gold. It's a whorehouse with lights. It doesn’t pretend to be holy, it just hands you your demons in a cocktail glass and dares you to drink deep. There’s no place like it — not on this earth, maybe not in this universe. Vegas is its own dirty planet, spinning on sin, fueled by regret, and lit up by the lies people tell themselves at 3 in the morning when they’re broke and bleeding chips.
Some bastards fall in love with it — headfirst, teeth first, soul first. Some call it hell with air conditioning. Some just come to watch the fire. And some never leave.
But whatever Vegas does to you, it does it loud. It scrapes the rust off your guts and shows you what’s underneath — the beauty, the rot, the animal. You don’t come here to find yourself. You come here to get exposed.Show moreOGuest review byOleh ChyrkinCanadaSee reviews by guests who stayed at hotels in Las VegasSee allThe Carriage HouseLas Vegas Strip, Las VegasFrom $220.69 per nightScored out of 10, guest rating 8.98.9Excellent - What previous guests thought, 2,250 reviews Excellent · 2,250 reviewsThe location was excellent.
