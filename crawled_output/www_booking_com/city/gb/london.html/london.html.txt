Many of the major museums are free, but the smaller ones are not so plan ahead. Watch out for the cyclists or the drivers when you are crossing the road. They were some of the meaner interactions I saw out of many major cities i've been to. Pizza Pilgrims in Carnabyoff Reagent's St was delicious. I enjoyed really just walking the city and seeing the free museums.

Transportation wasn't that good. The Underground was very reliable, but there were problems with the payment (Tap-In/Tap-Out glitched out several times, Google Wallet did not work). We found the famous double-decker busses to be very unreliable, seemed like they ignored the schedule completely.
