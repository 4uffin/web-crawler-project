The overall impression was nothing short of great. From the moment I stepped through the doors, I was welcomed by the hotel's exceptional staff. They exhibited professionalism, friendliness, and a commitment to providing the best service possible.
One of the most impressive aspects of my stay was the hotel itself. Being a newly constructed facility, everything was pristine and modern. It was evident that thoughtfulness and meticulous attention to detail had gone into its design. The decor was not just up-to-date, but fashioned to such an impressive extent that it almost felt like I was stepping into a designer's dream. Every corner of the hotel was aesthetically pleasing and created an atmosphere of luxury and comfort.
A significant part of my contentment came from the high level of comfort provided by the beds. They were simply perfect - providing a quality of sleep one often longs for when away from home. The bed's comfort is a testament to the hotel's commitment to ensuring its guests experience the highest level of relaxation during their stay.
In conclusion, my stay at this hotel was an experience filled with comfort, luxury, and top-notch service. The commitment of the staff to their guests, the remarkable decor, and the exceptional comfort provided, especially in the beds, truly set this hotel apart. I wholeheartedly recommend this hotel to anyone seeking a delightful and memorable stay.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.49.4Wonderful - What previous guests thought, 1,673 reviewsWonderful 1,673 reviewsPrice from$2881 night, 2 adultsCheck availabilityLa Planque HotelHotel in 10th arr., ParisFeaturing a terrace, La Planque Hotel is located in Paris in the Île de France region, one mile from Gare du Nord and a 14-minute walk from Gare de l'Est.

The Parisians are nice and helpful people; don't believe what they say about them... especially when it comes to Hollywood's movies; case in point: "Emily in Paris" .... see the "Accidental Tourist" instead

The food is great, especially when it comes to bakeries. Stay away from the touristy restaurants if you want to save. Try the typical fast food franchises like McDonald's, and it will do the job
