The Parisians are nice and helpful people; don't believe what they say about them... especially when it comes to Hollywood's movies; case in point: "Emily in Paris" .... see the "Accidental Tourist" instead
:)
The food is great, especially when it comes to bakeries. Stay away from the touristy restaurants if you want to save. Try the typical fast food franchises like McDonald's, and it will do the job
