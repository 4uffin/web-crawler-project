Famous hot dog stand, rainbow street, shopping all a very short walk.
Property was so cozy and the room was great and agree with other reviewers - the bed is like a cloud.
Heat control in room was good- never cold. Breakfast was fabulous. So many choices and delicious. I wasn’t going to pay the extra but was really glad I did.
Very close to Bus Stop so easy for tours and airport transfer.
Spa downstairs was fabulous but the room is so comfortable didn’t use but once. Also, 7-11 next door and some drinks etc for sale at the desk. Great experience and so glad I picked this hotel and paid a bit more.

If you weren't physically fit - a trip to Iceland would change that for sure!
What a beautiful city. Clean and environmental friendly.
Even the public water closets/toilets were clean and well maintained!
We loved all the attractions and history Iceland has to offer. And as they boast - the water from the faucet is ice cold, clean and clear!
The only down side to the city would be for those who need wheelchair access, rollator paths or aren't physically fit. There aren't many areas that can accommodate those needs.

Reykjavik itself is a great place to vist. Compact enough to walk around with a great atmosphere. Plenty of food choices and lots to see and do.
Do the 'free walking tour' for great information and to visit parts of the city you may not normally get to.
Outside of Reykjarvik the countryside is just stunning. You must do the Golden Circle including Thingvellir National Park, Geysir, Gullfoss and if you hire a car also go to Kerid Crater.
Also the Blue Lagoon is a must.

A round of 4 drinks - 2 soft drinks and two beers £34
An average meal out for 4 people with a round of drinks £200

Iceland is pretty expensive, so look into food options and excursions when you are planning your trip. We spent >$60 CAD for a 4 ice cream cones at Perlan, for example. Be prepared to have some extra spending money ahead of the trip.
