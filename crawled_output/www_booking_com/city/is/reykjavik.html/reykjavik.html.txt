Famous hot dog stand, rainbow street, shopping all a very short walk.
Property was so cozy and the room was great and agree with other reviewers - the bed is like a cloud.
Heat control in room was good- never cold. Breakfast was fabulous. So many choices and delicious. I wasn’t going to pay the extra but was really glad I did.
Very close to Bus Stop so easy for tours and airport transfer.
Spa downstairs was fabulous but the room is so comfortable didn’t use but once. Also, 7-11 next door and some drinks etc for sale at the desk. Great experience and so glad I picked this hotel and paid a bit more.

The city is very walk-able and, if you choose your hotel correctly, very convenient for various tour and City buses.
We spent two days touring and had time to visit the Reykjavik "sights" in 2 evenings and a couple hours the final day. A car is not necessary in the city and it looks like parking would be tight (and probably expensive).Show moreDGuest review byDavidUnited States8.0We spent 10 hours doing the circle which was amazing!We spent 10 hours doing the circle which was amazing!

Best: walking through tectonic plates! Lunch at tomato farm! Geysers! Blue Lagoon! Waterfalls! A wonderful day!

If you weren't physically fit - a trip to Iceland would change that for sure!
What a beautiful city. Clean and environmental friendly.
Even the public water closets/toilets were clean and well maintained!
We loved all the attractions and history Iceland has to offer. And as they boast - the water from the faucet is ice cold, clean and clear!
The only down side to the city would be for those who need wheelchair access, rollator paths or aren't physically fit. There aren't many areas that can accommodate those needs.
Even at the airport, it isn't very accessible.Show moreJGuest review byJeannineUnited States10.0Friendly city with lots to do and see.Friendly city with lots to do and see. Nice murals on a lot of buildings and interesting art work in various places.

Reykjavik itself is a great place to vist. Compact enough to walk around with a great atmosphere. Plenty of food choices and lots to see and do.
Do the 'free walking tour' for great information and to visit parts of the city you may not normally get to.
Outside of Reykjarvik the countryside is just stunning. You must do the Golden Circle including Thingvellir National Park, Geysir, Gullfoss and if you hire a car also go to Kerid Crater.
Also the Blue Lagoon is a must.
Despite being there for 4 full days we did not do everything and will come back.Show moreNGuest review byNealUnited KingdomSee reviews by guests who stayed at hotels in ReykjavíkSee allMengi ApartmentsReykjavíkScored out of 10, guest rating 9.09.0Wonderful - What previous guests thought, 485 reviews Wonderful · 485 reviewsGreat place to stay in the heart of Reykjavik city centre.

A little tip for parking - park in zone P3 it is on 70-100m from the apartment, it is a way cheaper than P1.
In the apartment there is everything you need for you stay.
