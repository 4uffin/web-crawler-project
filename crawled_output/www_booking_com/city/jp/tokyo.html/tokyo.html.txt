CClaudiaFromMexicoWe loved our stay here! at the beginning we were not sure if staying in this hotel or others in Shibuya/Shinjuku because of location but we ended up choosing this one, and it was the best decision for us! After touristing all day it was nice to come to a calm and quite neighborhood/hotel.
The station is right in front of the hotel so is easy to move around tokyo (and you never stay in just one area).
We had two full beds, so the room was bigger than other standard double rooms in other hotels.
The convini store inside the hotel is amazing, anything you need is right there.
Staff is very friendly and attentive.
Very clean rooms.
They clean up the room and change towels everyday (not all hotels in tokyo do this everyday).Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.19.1Wonderful - What previous guests thought, 1,133 reviewsWonderful 1,133 reviewsLocation 8.9Price from$154.321 night, 2 adultsCheck availabilityulu TokyoHotel in Koto Ward, TokyoAttractively located in the Koto Ward district of Tokyo, ulu Tokyo is located a 8-minute walk from Monument of Electric Experiment at Hiraga Gennai, 500 yards from Shibusawa Eiichi Taku Monument and a...OOliverFromIsle of ManThis hotel is really modern, I think they only renovated the building recently and it shows, it’s immaculate with all new fixtures and fittings.

It’s so huge that you’ll have to come to grips with public transport and maybe even experience being pushed onto a train. Yes, it does actually happen!Get your bearings by ascending the Tokyo World Trade Center near the waterfront, and savor the fantastic views taking in the red-and-white Tokyo Tower and Shinkuju’s skyscrapers. North is Ueno, home to the best museums (including the Tokyo National Museum) and a large park bursting with cherry blossom in spring.Equally tranquil are the Chiyoda Imperial Palace and Gardens, surrounded by water. Also in gardens is the Meiji Jingu Shinto shrine in Shibuya, a youthful district where neon abounds.For more traditional Japanese culture, head to Asakusa whose Sensō-ji Buddhist temple is Tokyo’s oldest temple. Outdoor markets sell a variety of wares, though shopping in Tokyo is, of course, fantastic wherever you go.Whether you stay in a Japanese ryokan, luxury Tokyo hotel or a hostel, don’t fly out of Tokyo Narita Airport or Haneda Airport without having tried sushi. Another Japanese institution is the sento (public bath) and onsen (hot springs bath) – a must try. Also incredibly popular are Tokyo Disneyland and Tokyo DisneySea, Asia’s 2 most visited theme parks.Learn more about visiting Tokyo2082 attractions1747 points of interest61 neighborhoodsFind out moreWhat Guests Said About Tokyo:8.0I love the fact that prices is cheaper then in my country ☺️...I love the fact that prices is cheaper then in my country ☺️ What i don't like about Tokyo?

I wasn’t particularly impressed by its traditional or local vibe, but it’s definitely great for shopping, tech, and food. The public transport is efficient, punctual, and offers a lot of options. However, you can still find nearby villages or towns, like Kamakura or Nikko, that offer a more traditional feel and a calmer atmosphere. Overall, it’s a great place to visit once in a lifetime to experience the hustle and bustle, but I don’t think you’d need to stay for too long.Show morePGuest review byPakapant RujichitUnited Kingdom6.0The people is the best of Tokyo. but it's very crowded.The people is the best of Tokyo. but it's very crowded.

The city blends tradition and innovation so seamlessly—one moment you're sipping matcha in a centuries-old teahouse, the next you're navigating a robot-run café in Shibuya. Public transport was a dream: clean, punctual, and easy to navigate even for a first-timer. The locals were incredibly polite and helpful, and the food? A revelation. From sushi counters to steaming bowls of ramen tucked into alleyways, every meal was a highlight.

The staff were helpful when we needed them but generally hands-off as you check-in and check-out on computers in the lobby yourself.
