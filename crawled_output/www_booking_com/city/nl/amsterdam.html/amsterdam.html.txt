The beautiful city houses, romantic bridges, iconic canals and street cafés create its unique atmosphere and give you an ultimate taste of its fascinating past. Famous for its museums, most important of which are located in the Museumplein, Amsterdam offers you a chance to see unforgettable masterpieces by Rembrandt, Van Gogh, Mondriaan and more. The Anne Frank House is a sobering reminder of the city’s more recent history. After a lot of walking, the Rijksmuseum is a great place to rest and get some extra culture before visiting Amsterdam’s lovely Vondelpark. The medieval Old Center with the always busy Dam Square and the tempting Red Lights District is the most visited part of Amsterdam. Make sure to stop at Leidseplein and Rembrandtplein, homes to the best nightlife venues. Shop till you drop at Amsterdam’s most luxury shopping street, PC Hooftstraat, the most popular street market at Albert Cuyp or in the fancy design shops of the Jordaan district. Famous pancakes and frites with mayonnaise are a must-try! The more adventurous traveler might want to try the pickled herring, followed closely by a local beer. All these attractions are just a short train ride from the Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport. Whether you want to stay at a cozy hotel on a canal, a modern apartment in a quiet part of the city or a room in the center of everything, Booking.com has a perfect accommodation for your Amsterdam vacation.Learn more about visiting Amsterdam1773 attractions122 points of interest26 neighborhoodsFind out moreWhat Guests Said About Amsterdam:10.0I really liked Amsterdam, I didn't even expect it.I really liked Amsterdam, I didn't even expect it.
There are many beautiful houses along the canals and lots of cosy bridges. Even far from the city centre, where there are more modern buildings, there is a lot of greenery, which gives the city a special charm. I really liked the STRAAT Museum of Contemporary Art — I recommend it to everyone. I didn't expect so many cyclists, so be careful )

We enjoyed Bodyworks, Mono, and Ripley's the most.

(Allow at least 4 hours).
We wanted to spend a day at the museum of the history of Amsterdam, but sadly it was closed and that was not indicated on their website. So be careful.I would advise taking a canal
trip first to get acquainted with the city. We chose a tour with a small boat and we would recommend such a choice. Live commentaries, no audio guide.Visiting a couple of mansions which had belonged to local merchants is interesting.

I have travelled to Amsterdam 6 times in the last 2 years, all in different hotels. This was by far the best location, we didn’t use taxis or public transport once as we were able to walk everywhere. City centre is 5 mins away. Despite this the hotel is situated on a really quiet road on a canal which is beautiful.
