Accessibility here was superb as it was smacked in the metro and bus station. With a heavy luggage, I didn't have to drag it all the way in cobble stones or in apartment without lift. I was also upgraded to a quad room. It was big with a nice city view overlooking the bus station.

There are many beautiful houses along the canals and lots of cosy bridges. Even far from the city centre, where there are more modern buildings, there is a lot of greenery, which gives the city a special charm. I really liked the STRAAT Museum of Contemporary Art — I recommend it to everyone. I didn't expect so many cyclists, so be careful )

We enjoyed Bodyworks, Mono, and Ripley's the most.

(Allow at least 4 hours).
We wanted to spend a day at the museum of the history of Amsterdam, but sadly it was closed and that was not indicated on their website. So be careful.I would advise taking a canal
trip first to get acquainted with the city. We chose a tour with a small boat and we would recommend such a choice. Live commentaries, no audio guide.Visiting a couple of mansions which had belonged to local merchants is interesting.
