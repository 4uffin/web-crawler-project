They did everything in their power to ensure I had a pleasant stay.
Room is extremely small by US standards!
Room could use a microwave, the only one available was on the ground floor and I was on the 7th.Show moreMGuest review byMarkGermany10.0Kameoka is the starting point of the famous and historical...Kameoka is the starting point of the famous and historical Hozu River rafting ride that takes you to Arashiyama, home of the famous bamboo forest. Enjoy the rafting, enjoy Arashiyama and take the train back to Kameoka. Hotel is a 5 minute walk from the station. A perfect day.Show moreDGuest review byDeepuJapan8.0The owners were very friendly and helpful.The owners were very friendly and helpful. Everything was very clean!
The only confusion was that the description on Booking.com states that breakfast is available, it doesn‚Äôt say that you pay extra for it. I also paid for towels. If I understand correctly the coat is then deducted from the room fee but it really wasn‚Äôt clear.Show moreCGuest review byCatherineCanada10.0Gionmachi is a wonderful section of Kyoto and offers much to...Gionmachi is a wonderful section of Kyoto and offers much to see and experience.
It is easy, maybe 15 to 20 minutes taxi to other areas of Kyoto that are also beautiful, historical and traditional.
Overall, this is a place I would come back to because I have much more to see.Show moreAGuest review byAlanUnited States10.0We explored quite a bit in Kyoto Gardens, Palaces, and...We explored quite a bit in Kyoto Gardens, Palaces, and Temples. We loved that there were so many places to find food and good food at that when we were visiting most of these places. Also there is a lot of places to shop and very convient that you can find something for everyone. We cant wait for our next visit to Japan and Kyoto very soonShow moreAGuest review byAnonymous10.0Lots of tourists on holidays but pretty peaceful on normal...Lots of tourists on holidays but pretty peaceful on normal days. The beach was great but I think they limit the days you can swim. Nice stroll along the sandbar. Amanohashidate is the main thing, there's nothing much to do in Ine aside from taking the boat tour. It's probably best to take the tour that starts from Amanohashidate and goes straight to Ine if you want to save time.Show moreAGuest review byAshwenPhilippines10.0I especially recommend it to travelers from overseas.I especially recommend it to travelers from overseas.
If you are sightseeing in Kyoto, Nara, or Osaka for a few days, staying at this facility and using Kameoka as your base will be the best way to travel to Kansai.
Like taking a day trip from your home.
If your schedule is 2 nights and 3 days or 3 nights and 4 days, it is definitely a good deal even if you add transportation expenses. You can't stay in a house in Kyoto or Nara.Show moreeGuest review byeltopoJapan10.0I loved this hotel!!! The service was outstanding.I loved this hotel!!! The service was outstanding. The rooms were beautiful and clean. The location was perfect - close to town but not in town.
We walked everywhere and felt very safe. Close to the train station as well. I will certainly stay here on my next trip to Kyoto.Show moreCGuest review byCatherineUnited StatesResearch, refine, and make plans for your whole tripHotels in KyotoThinking about which towns and cities to visit during your trip to Kyoto?
