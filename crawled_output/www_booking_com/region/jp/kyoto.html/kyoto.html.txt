The key tourist sites are overrun now, so head for the ‚Äúatypical‚Äù locations - there are so many temples you don‚Äôt have to see the usual ones. Nijo-Jo castle is a must, but go later in the day to avoid crowds.
Make sure you try the really small kitchen/resurants, where some of the cooking is exceptional.Show moreDGuest review byDavidUnited Kingdom10.0Miyazu which includes Amanohashidate, is one of three...Miyazu which includes Amanohashidate, is one of three natural sites in Japan.
The land bridge spans across the sea is fun to view from the observation points (on both sides) and you can actually bike (20 minutes) or walk (50 minutes) one way across.
A small town with lots of charm and beauty.Show moreAGuest review byAmyCanada8.0The staff was awesome!The staff was awesome!

The only confusion was that the description on Booking.com states that breakfast is available, it doesn‚Äôt say that you pay extra for it. I also paid for towels.

It is easy, maybe 15 to 20 minutes taxi to other areas of Kyoto that are also beautiful, historical and traditional.

The beach was great but I think they limit the days you can swim. Nice stroll along the sandbar. Amanohashidate is the main thing, there's nothing much to do in Ine aside from taking the boat tour. It's probably best to take the tour that starts from Amanohashidate and goes straight to Ine if you want to save time.Show moreAGuest review byAshwenPhilippines10.0I especially recommend it to travelers from overseas.I especially recommend it to travelers from overseas.
If you are sightseeing in Kyoto, Nara, or Osaka for a few days, staying at this facility and using Kameoka as your base will be the best way to travel to Kansai.
Like taking a day trip from your home.
If your schedule is 2 nights and 3 days or 3 nights and 4 days, it is definitely a good deal even if you add transportation expenses. You can't stay in a house in Kyoto or Nara.Show moreeGuest review byeltopoJapan10.0I loved this hotel!!! The service was outstanding.I loved this hotel!!! The service was outstanding. The rooms were beautiful and clean. The location was perfect - close to town but not in town.
We walked everywhere and felt very safe. Close to the train station as well. I will certainly stay here on my next trip to Kyoto.Show moreCGuest review byCatherineUnited StatesResearch, refine, and make plans for your whole tripHotels in JapanIf you're planning a longer trip, look beyond Kyoto and explore the whole country!Hotels in Mount Fuji Discover another popular destination in Japan.Hotels in Osaka PrefectureDiscover another popular destination in Japan.Ryokans in KyotoExplore more great accommodation options for your trip.Guest Houses in KyotoExplore more great accommodation options for your trip.Hotels in KyotoA popular choice with guests visiting Kyoto.Hotels in MaizuruThinking about which towns and cities to visit during your trip to Kyoto?
