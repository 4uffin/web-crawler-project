The land bridge spans across the sea is fun to view from the observation points (on both sides) and you can actually bike (20 minutes) or walk (50 minutes) one way across.
A small town with lots of charm and beauty.Show moreAGuest review byAmyCanada8.0The staff was awesome!The staff was awesome!
They did everything in their power to ensure I had a pleasant stay.
Room is extremely small by US standards!
Room could use a microwave, the only one available was on the ground floor and I was on the 7th.Show moreMGuest review byMarkGermany10.0Kameoka is the starting point of the famous and historical...Kameoka is the starting point of the famous and historical Hozu River rafting ride that takes you to Arashiyama, home of the famous bamboo forest. Enjoy the rafting, enjoy Arashiyama and take the train back to Kameoka. Hotel is a 5 minute walk from the station. A perfect day.Show moreDGuest review byDeepuJapan8.0The owners were very friendly and helpful.The owners were very friendly and helpful. Everything was very clean!
The only confusion was that the description on Booking.com states that breakfast is available, it doesn’t say that you pay extra for it. I also paid for towels. If I understand correctly the coat is then deducted from the room fee but it really wasn’t clear.Show moreCGuest review byCatherineCanada10.0Gionmachi is a wonderful section of Kyoto and offers much to...Gionmachi is a wonderful section of Kyoto and offers much to see and experience.
It is easy, maybe 15 to 20 minutes taxi to other areas of Kyoto that are also beautiful, historical and traditional.
Overall, this is a place I would come back to because I have much more to see.Show moreAGuest review byAlanUnited States8.0Even though one could say compared to any other time in the...Even though one could say compared to any other time in the past that the city is really full of tourists, the local seem to understand and have adjusted. I think it’s obvious that it looks different than most cities in Japan making It forever

The beach was great but I think they limit the days you can swim. Nice stroll along the sandbar. Amanohashidate is the main thing, there's nothing much to do in Ine aside from taking the boat tour. It's probably best to take the tour that starts from Amanohashidate and goes straight to Ine if you want to save time.Show moreAGuest review byAshwenPhilippines10.0I especially recommend it to travelers from overseas.I especially recommend it to travelers from overseas.
If you are sightseeing in Kyoto, Nara, or Osaka for a few days, staying at this facility and using Kameoka as your base will be the best way to travel to Kansai.
Like taking a day trip from your home.
If your schedule is 2 nights and 3 days or 3 nights and 4 days, it is definitely a good deal even if you add transportation expenses. You can't stay in a house in Kyoto or Nara.Show moreeGuest review byeltopoJapan10.0I loved this hotel!!! The service was outstanding.I loved this hotel!!! The service was outstanding. The rooms were beautiful and clean. The location was perfect - close to town but not in town.
We walked everywhere and felt very safe. Close to the train station as well. I will certainly stay here on my next trip to Kyoto.Show moreCGuest review byCatherineUnited StatesResearch, refine, and make plans for your whole tripHotels in Mount Fuji Hit the road and make the most of your trip by discovering another popular destination in Japan.Hotels in Osaka PrefectureDiscover another popular destination in Japan.Hotels in KyotoA popular choice with guests visiting Kyoto.Hotels in MaizuruA popular choice with guests visiting Kyoto.Hotels in JapanSet off to explore the whole country.When to visit JapanEvents, prices, weather, and more.Hotels in KinkiThinking about a longer trip?
