Loved the Toadstool Hoodoos which is located at the Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument just before getting into Kanab and it is only a 1.7 mi RT hike.
Loved Wild Thyme restaurant.
Had their salmon dish and we shared a delish dessert.
Went to Moqui Cave. Very interesting story of the lineage of the Hopi Cave told by the employees.
It is very touristy but very cool to check out and if you are into rocks, gems, Native American jewelry, it is a must stop.
They have wind caves there but didn‚Äôt have time for that.

We found a few great restaurants - River Rock Roasting Company's cinnamon rolls are not to be missed. We also loved Main Street Cafe. There's everything you need - grocery stores, Walmart, gas stations, and restaurants.
While staying in Hurricane, we embarked on a Canyoning tour with Red Desert Adventure. It was phenomenal! If rappelling down waterfalls, climbing Via Ferratta, and zip lining across canyons sounds like your happy place, then I highly recommend it!

The room was cozy and had everything we needed (we even managed to iron a shirt before going out for dinner). The pool is large and pleasant, and breakfast was plentiful with a good variety of options. We enjoyed it as a great base for our hikes in Zion National Park. The one thing I would change is the large parking area inside the property, which many rooms face.
