The late check out is important to me because I normally do not feel well in the mornings.
In room coffee is not available but who really likes that anyway?
The TV was upgraded and very nice.
Best of all is the family that owns and runs this little motel.
The owner is one of the kindest men and he is so accommodating.
He and the family are just the best.
