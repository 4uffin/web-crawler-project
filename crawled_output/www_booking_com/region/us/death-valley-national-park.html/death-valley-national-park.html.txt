Get inspired by reviews of cities in Death Valley National Park10.0Unique place - it includes 'Badwater Basin' - about 30 mins'...Unique place - it includes 'Badwater Basin' - about 30 mins' drive from the Inn at Death Valley. Badwater Basin is the lowest point in the whole of North America and is 85 metres BELOW sea level. A massive salt flat stretching as far as the eye can see and very, very hot in July.
Death Valley area also includes Zabriskie Point overlooking the Bad Lands of the desert. We came upon it by chance on the way to the Inn (10-15 mins up the road) and stopped off to walk the short 'stroll' in the afternoon heat to the viewpoint. Very well worth the effort!Show moreNGuest review byNickUnited Kingdom10.0I like being able to tune into the NHL playoff game between...I like being able to tune into the NHL playoff game between the Oilers and Golden Knights at the local bar.
