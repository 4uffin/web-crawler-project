There is so much history at this Resort.
The "Base-to-Base" gondola opens up so much more terrain to ski.
The "Village" is nicely planned with shops and stores and great places to eat.
There is even a tiny Market to help stock the fridge (but only for quick items, essential).
If planing on staying up there for a week, also plan on going "into town" to purchase more grocery items (a car is needed)... UBER prices from Reno Airport are about $110.
LIMITED OR NO Uber services returning to Reno!!!
Cost to Return can be as high as $500.... If you Uber, get your drivers name and number; make an arrangement to contact that Uber driver and have them drive you back to Reno at the end of your vacation: Cash deal; off the books; it would be like a private limousine service. (about $125-$150)Show moreRGuest review byRoy10.0Gardnerville is a quiet little city adjoining Minden, 16...Gardnerville is a quiet little city adjoining Minden, 16 miles from Carson City, and just down the very steep Kingsbury Grade from Stateline and South Lake Tahoe.
