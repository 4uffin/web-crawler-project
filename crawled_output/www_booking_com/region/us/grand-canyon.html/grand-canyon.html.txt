Loved the Toadstool Hoodoos which is located at the Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument just before getting into Kanab and it is only a 1.7 mi RT hike.
Loved Wild Thyme restaurant.
Had their salmon dish and we shared a delish dessert.
Went to Moqui Cave. Very interesting story of the lineage of the Hopi Cave told by the employees.
It is very touristy but very cool to check out and if you are into rocks, gems, Native American jewelry, it is a must stop.
They have wind caves there but didn’t have time for that.
A beautiful area.

The border Store on the edge of the state border with Arizona is a great little gem - the people are so friendly and the store is well equipped.
I loved this little town and would highly recommend it.Show morekGuest review bykynanceAustralia10.0Peach Springs is amazing with plenty of panoramic views,...Peach Springs is amazing with plenty of panoramic views, especially the grand canyon west tour that comes with general admission to the area. If you go, just pay for the overpriced sky walk experience. Although it's a bit too expensive, given there are other free views, it's a must do if you're making the trip anyway. Don't stay at the Haupia Cabins; they're not good. Instead, you may want to stay in nearby Kingman, AZ and drive in to Grand Canyon West. This is a better option, trust me!Show moreJGuest review byJesse GuillenUnited States6.0Things are changing in Ash Fork A brand new gas station.Things are changing in Ash Fork A brand new gas station. Restaurant has changed hands but the best eating place is the one next to the new gas station....The Ranch House.
