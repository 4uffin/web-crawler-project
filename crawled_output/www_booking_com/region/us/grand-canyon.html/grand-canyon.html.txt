Loved the Toadstool Hoodoos which is located at the Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument just before getting into Kanab and it is only a 1.7 mi RT hike.
Loved Wild Thyme restaurant.
Had their salmon dish and we shared a delish dessert.
Went to Moqui Cave. Very interesting story of the lineage of the Hopi Cave told by the employees.
It is very touristy but very cool to check out and if you are into rocks, gems, Native American jewelry, it is a must stop.
They have wind caves there but didn’t have time for that.
A beautiful area.
Reminds me of a mini-Sedona. History of old Hollywood filming westerns in Kanab.Show moreKGuest review byKristin6.0Its isolated. 30 minutes from everywhere.Its isolated. 30 minutes from everywhere.

If you go, just pay for the overpriced sky walk experience. Although it's a bit too expensive, given there are other free views, it's a must do if you're making the trip anyway. Don't stay at the Haupia Cabins; they're not good. Instead, you may want to stay in nearby Kingman, AZ and drive in to Grand Canyon West.
