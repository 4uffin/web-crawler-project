My family truly enjoyed every moment of our trip.Show moreOGuest review byOlibrice8.0We had a hire car as we always do as public transport is not...We had a hire car as we always do as public transport is not as widely available in Orlando as in other cities. Uber and Lift are easily available but we prefer to have our own car for ease of use. The cost of car hire has
fallen so it is not as expensive as it was just after covid.
We did find that the cost of food in the supermarkets and restaurants has risen since our last visit, quite substantially in some places.
There do not seem to be the buffet style eateries which were always such good value for a quick stop meal, I’m guessing most have now closed down which is sad.
Anyone planning a theme park trip will already know the tickets aren’t cheap! However there are good combinations to be had and strangely it seems the longer you buy tickets for the better value they are, even if it means you don’t use every day up. Food and drink in the parks is expensive but water stations are freely available to refill bottles.Show moreTGuest review byTraceyUnited Kingdom10.0I love coming to Kissimmee.

The access to Disney and Universal is great and simple to get to. There are all of the fast food places as well as delicious sit-downs like Texas Roadhouse, which is a family favorite for us. There are so many attractions, live music events and free events around every corner. The traffic is terrible and getting around can be complicated for a first timer, but if you stay in the outskirts and can avoid the highways, life is easy.Show moreDGuest review byDavidUnited StatesResearch, refine, and make plans for your whole tripHotels near Orlando International AirportFind hotels conveniently close to the area's most popular airport – perfect for a late arrival or early departure.Hotels near Orlando Sanford International AirportPerfect for a late arrival or early departure.Hotels in Yosemite National ParkDiscover another popular destination in the United States.Hotels in New JerseyDiscover another popular destination in the United States.Cheap vacations in OrlandoBook the best flights, stays, and more – all in one placeFlights to Disney World AreaGetting to Disney World Area just got easier!Hotels in FloridaThinking about a longer trip?
