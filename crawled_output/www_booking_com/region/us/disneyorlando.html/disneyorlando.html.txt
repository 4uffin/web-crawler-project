Get inspired by reviews of cities in Disney World Area8.0The Disney parks were great, but some of the rides are a bit...The Disney parks were great, but some of the rides are a bit old as we have been coming to Orlando for some years now and have seen them all.The new park at Universal was a bit of a let down ,we had to be in line for over 2 hours for a basic 2 minutes ride which was a copy of the one in Universal LA.some of the rides were broken down, for people in their 70's the stairs were abit of a trial.The food restaurants in Universal Epic were very good, Disney should improve theirs to the Epic standard.Show moreFGuest review byFrankIreland10.0Personally, I am very easy to please, and Kissimmee was...Personally, I am very easy to please, and Kissimmee was exactly what my family needed. The attractions are conveniently located. Aquatica water park was only a 20-minute drive, and SeaWorld was just in between. The Old Town House is adorable and caters to all types of people. My family truly enjoyed every moment of our trip.Show moreOGuest review byOlibrice8.0We had a hire car as we always do as public transport is not...We had a hire car as we always do as public transport is not as widely available in Orlando as in other cities. Uber and Lift are easily available but we prefer to have our own car for ease of use. The cost of car hire has
fallen so it is not as expensive as it was just after covid.
We did find that the cost of food in the supermarkets and restaurants has risen since our last visit, quite substantially in some places.
There do not seem to be the buffet style eateries which were always such good value for a quick stop meal, I‚Äôm guessing most have now closed down which is sad.
Anyone planning a theme park trip will already know the tickets aren‚Äôt cheap! However there are good combinations to be had and strangely it seems the longer you buy tickets for the better value they are, even if it means you don‚Äôt use every day up. Food and drink in the parks is expensive but water stations are freely available to refill bottles.Show moreTGuest review byTraceyUnited Kingdom10.0I love coming to Kissimmee. It has everything!I love coming to Kissimmee. It has everything! It's close to Disney, there are plenty of places to eat, you have Old Town amusement park, there are highways that take you straight to Universal Studios and Sea World, hundreds of hotels to choose from, shops, flea markets.... I could go on and on.Show moreDGuest review byDIANEUnited States10.0My daughter and I love Orlando.My daughter and I love Orlando. There is so much to do and they have great weather most of the year.

The access to Disney and Universal is great and simple to get to. There are all of the fast food places as well as delicious sit-downs like Texas Roadhouse, which is a family favorite for us. There are so many attractions, live music events and free events around every corner. The traffic is terrible and getting around can be complicated for a first timer, but if you stay in the outskirts and can avoid the highways, life is easy.Show moreDGuest review byDavidUnited StatesResearch, refine, and make plans for your whole tripHotels in OrlandoThinking about which towns and cities to visit during your trip to Disney World Area?
