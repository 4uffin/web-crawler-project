Loved the Toadstool Hoodoos which is located at the Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument just before getting into Kanab and it is only a 1.7 mi RT hike.
Loved Wild Thyme restaurant.
Had their salmon dish and we shared a delish dessert.
Went to Moqui Cave. Very interesting story of the lineage of the Hopi Cave told by the employees.
It is very touristy but very cool to check out and if you are into rocks, gems, Native American jewelry, it is a must stop.
They have wind caves there but didn’t have time for that.

I ordered the delicious Shrimp Tacos for my dinner and they came with homemade fries.
Very good!
Thank you Brian Head for having such a wonderful place and room to spend my one night on my travels.

So if you are planning to do one, book early. There was only 1 restaurant that open while we were there. We love the Petrified Forest, Escalante River hike, Lower Calf Falls, as well as the Long Slot Canyon. Some of the attractions need a 4x4. Wish we knew ahead of time. Overall, very enjoyable! Cute little town with lots to do.Show moreDGuest review byDianaUnited States10.0Cannonville is in the Grand Staircase/Escalante National...Cannonville is in the Grand Staircase/Escalante National Monument, so there is beautiful scenery surrounding it and the nearby towns, including Bryce Canyon National Park, Kodachrome Basin State Park, and Grosvenor Arch. What's nice about Cannonville is that it's in a quiet little valley, so is less exposed to the coldest weather and the winds that buffet the higher, more exposed towns in the area. It's on Scenic Route 12, so any direction you travel has gorgeous scenery!
A day trip up to Capitol Reef is a little over two hours' drive away, and there are breath-taking landscapes and views all along the way. Loved it!Show morekGuest review bykarenUnited StatesResearch, refine, and make plans for your whole tripFlights to Bryce Canyon National Park Get your flight tickets to Bryce Canyon National Park
