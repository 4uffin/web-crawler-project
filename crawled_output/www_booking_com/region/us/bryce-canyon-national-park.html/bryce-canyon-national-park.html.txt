Loved the Toadstool Hoodoos which is located at the Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument just before getting into Kanab and it is only a 1.7 mi RT hike.
Loved Wild Thyme restaurant.
Had their salmon dish and we shared a delish dessert.
Went to Moqui Cave. Very interesting story of the lineage of the Hopi Cave told by the employees.
It is very touristy but very cool to check out and if you are into rocks, gems, Native American jewelry, it is a must stop.
They have wind caves there but didn’t have time for that.
A beautiful area.

What's nice about Cannonville is that it's in a quiet little valley, so is less exposed to the coldest weather and the winds that buffet the higher, more exposed towns in the area. It's on Scenic Route 12, so any direction you travel has gorgeous scenery!
A day trip up to Capitol Reef is a little over two hours' drive away, and there are breath-taking landscapes and views all along the way.
