However I stayed 3 nights there not once the housekeeper checking the room or refill my coffee or clean up my room. it should be a standard services to clean up daily. When I get back in the evening is too late to ask to clean up the room.Show moreIGuest review byIETJEUnited States10.0It's a perfect beach holidayIt's a perfect beach holiday
Not all that geared up for kids
Lots of events going on but more for adults
Millions of places to eat, everywhere we chose to eat was lovely, I doubt you would find a bad place.
We did the open top tour and boat trip, both good but make sure you know the difference between booking the hop on hop off or continuous tourShow moreAGuest review byAdrianUnited Kingdom10.0The water was very clear, and the sand was brilliant white.The water was very clear, and the sand was brilliant white.

From The Sea Aquarium to The Hard Rock hotel and casino and of course Bush Gardens. The best retail therapy with Hyde Park and International Plaza. The traffic was crazy there. I thought Orlando was bad this city might be a little worse. You'd better be in the right lane for turning or you'll never get in.Show morejGuest review byjudeUnited States10.0It is great the weekend I went had a great air show with...It is great the weekend I went had a great air show with Blue Angels flying in the sky. It adheres to multiple vibes even the club scene to go dancing or the family- bike rentals are available enough restaurants on the strip and one of the Best Pizza shops in Broward not like Chicago or New York pizza but still good and large in serving.Show moreMGuest review byMilagroUnited States6.0It is a bigger city than I realized and more spread out so I...It is a bigger city than I realized and more spread out so I found that staying in northern Jacksonville was not the right area of the city for me and I ended up having to do a lot of driving. I think I prefer the southern Jacksonville, Nocatee, Jax beach or Ponte Vedra beach areas.Show moreKGuest review byKimUnited States8.0Key West is what you make of it, it offers something for...Key West is what you make of it, it offers something for everyone, whether you want shopping, the infamous Duval crawl, or just going to the beach or to indulge your interest in history at the various parks, it's all there.
Take a bicycle, parking is tough.
Key West is a fun stop for families or just couples looking to get away. Either way, make Key West a stop on your Florida vacation.Show moreCGuest review byCUnited States10.0Personally, I am very easy to please, and Kissimmee was...Personally, I am very easy to please, and Kissimmee was exactly what my family needed. The attractions are conveniently located. Aquatica water park was only a 20-minute drive, and SeaWorld was just in between. The Old Town House is adorable and caters to all types of people. My family truly enjoyed every moment of our trip.Show moreOGuest review byOlibrice10.0This was our first trip to Destin.This was our first trip to Destin.
The beaches are beautiful and not over crowded.
There were many great places to eat, we enjoyed Parlor Donuts, Beignet and Brews, Lulus, and the Backporch.
Also great shopping.
We did a lot school clothes shopping while we were there. Both Destin Commons and Destin Outlets had great stores.
We also went to the Gulfarium and our girls did the Penguin Encounter which was a lot of fun for them.
Oveall, we had a great trip and are already planning our next to Destin.Show moreHGuest review byHallieUnited StatesResearch, refine, and make plans for your whole tripHotels in OrlandoThinking about which towns and cities to visit during your trip to Florida?
