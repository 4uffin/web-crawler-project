Which was recommended by the car rental place due to lots of rain before we arrived and flooding. The weather ended up really nice and we still were able to ride with the top down. I learned to uber to and from the rental car building from the airport because its a long walk!
Uber/Lyft was less expensive than a cab.
It's also a 2.5 mile walk if you are going to Uber to the Dolphins game. Getting in wasn't bad but leaving was horrible. Got great ticket prices on stub hub an hour before the game. Pay for parking and pay attention to how close the lot is.Show moreRGuest review byReedyUnited States10.0It's a great city with lots to see.It's a great city with lots to see. From The Sea Aquarium to The Hard Rock hotel and casino and of course Bush Gardens. The best retail therapy with Hyde Park and International Plaza. The traffic was crazy there. I thought Orlando was bad this city might be a little worse. You'd better be in the right lane for turning or you'll never get in.Show morejGuest review byjudeUnited States10.0The water was very clear, and the sand was brilliant white.The water was very clear, and the sand was brilliant white.

I think I prefer the southern Jacksonville, Nocatee, Jax beach or Ponte Vedra beach areas.Show moreKGuest review byKimUnited States10.0Personally, I am very easy to please, and Kissimmee was...Personally, I am very easy to please, and Kissimmee was exactly what my family needed. The attractions are conveniently located. Aquatica water park was only a 20-minute drive, and SeaWorld was just in between. The Old Town House is adorable and caters to all types of people. My family truly enjoyed every moment of our trip.Show moreOGuest review byOlibrice10.0Place is life changing.Place is life changing. There’s not as much hate, more unity between people as a whole. Lots of history, LOTS of drinking. Fat Tuesdays and hogs breath saloon are great. Katie’s was great for brunch. Awesome food and great locals. The aquarium was awesome and the history is so cool. As a local to Florida I can’t think of a more homey place. ONE HUMAN FAMILY!Show moreGGuest review byGinaUnited States10.0This was our first trip to Destin.This was our first trip to Destin.
The beaches are beautiful and not over crowded.
There were many great places to eat, we enjoyed Parlor Donuts, Beignet and Brews, Lulus, and the Backporch.
Also great shopping.
We did a lot school clothes shopping while we were there. Both Destin Commons and Destin Outlets had great stores.
We also went to the Gulfarium and our girls did the Penguin Encounter which was a lot of fun for them.
Oveall, we had a great trip and are already planning our next to Destin.Show moreHGuest review byHallieUnited StatesResearch, refine, and make plans for your whole tripHotels in the United StatesIf you're planning a longer trip, look beyond Florida and explore the whole country!Hotels in Yosemite National ParkDiscover another popular destination in the United States.Hotels in New JerseyDiscover another popular destination in the United States.Villas in FloridaExplore more great accommodation options for your trip.Inns in FloridaExplore more great accommodation options for your trip.Flights to FloridaGetting to Florida just got easier!Hotels in OrlandoThinking about which towns and cities to visit during your trip to Florida?
