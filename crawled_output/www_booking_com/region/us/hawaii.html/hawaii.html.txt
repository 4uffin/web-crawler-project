Get inspired by reviews of cities in Hawaii8.0We only spent one night in Waikiki area, but it was...We only spent one night in Waikiki area, but it was considerably busier than the many other places we've been around the islands. Reminded me of Shibuya or Osaka (also in part due to affluence of Japanese tourists). We didn't visit many amenities but the beach at Waikiki was quite packed, even though we went there around 8 AM on a Monday in September (three lines of parties at all times). No major complain but not exactly the impression/expectation of the islands.Show moreMGuest review byMiguelSpain8.0The area is beautiful; however, the tragedy of the loss of...The area is beautiful; however, the tragedy of the loss of the Old Town Lahaina casts a pall over the area.
If you have memories of before the fire, it is very, very sad to see the remains of buildings and know that over 100 people lost their lives.
The sentiment of Lahaina Strong is wonderful and uplifting but as you speak with residents, the current, somber message is that we will never regain what has been lost and there is no definitive plan or timeline for rebuilding.
You are asked to not take photos and to respect the area.
There is a bypass road that has been built.Show moreGGuest review byGeorgeUnited States6.0As a Big Island resident, I think Kona is over rated and...As a Big Island resident, I think Kona is over rated and overpriced for what it is.

It still holds "The Essence of Hawaii."I LOVE Hilo!!! It still holds "The Essence of Hawaii." It is not overrun with tall modern buildings, and "Tacky Tourist Attractions."
It maintains an Old Hawaii Charm. You're not overwhelmed with street performers and aggressive sales people trying to pull you into their cosmetics stores. Yet there are still some homeless people there which is not good. However, I feel very safe in Hilo. There are nearby beautiful gardens and great beaches! Hilo is surrounded by so much natural beauty. There are some great restaurants there as well. I really like all of them, and I make sure to have at least one dinner at Hilo Bay Cafe. I also always make sure to visit the Imiloa Astronomy Center by UH Hilo. It is an excellent place to learn about the history & culture of Hawaii.
