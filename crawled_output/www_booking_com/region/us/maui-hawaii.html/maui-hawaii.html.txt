If you have memories of before the fire, it is very, very sad to see the remains of buildings and know that over 100 people lost their lives.
The sentiment of Lahaina Strong is wonderful and uplifting but as you speak with residents, the current, somber message is that we will never regain what has been lost and there is no definitive plan or timeline for rebuilding.
You are asked to not take photos and to respect the area.

The rooms are spacious and clean, offering coffee, tea, beach towels, personal care products (soap, shampoo, conditioner, body lotion).

There is a parking lot in front of the hotel entrance, for $10/day (+taxes).
The staff is very nice and keen to accommodate your requests. We were there on our honeymoon and they set up the room very nicely.

I would’ve liked to travel to the different islands. It was hard to book a boat ride too expensive. I wish it was a little bit cheaper to do different events. I think everything is over price that’s what I didn’t like about this island. It’s very hard to plan outings with the big group of people we had 13 and we couldn’t afford to be doing all the different events with the group that big my other family stayed in a different resort but we wanted to stay all together, and it was very expensive to book.Show moreMGuest review byMelizaUnited States8.0It's a small town.It's a small town.
