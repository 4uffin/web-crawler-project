Finding and paying for parking in NYC was a difficulty I could live without. Fortunately, most tolls were paid with the car rental agreement. The Secaucus location was perfect for driving, but the buses stop right outside the hotel. If it were available to guests, more information on bus routes to the City's main attractions, as well as details on paying for bus and subway toll passes and wheelchair accessibility, would be helpful and might change how a traveler chooses to get around.Show moreRGuest review byReyesUnited States10.0Nice secure area, mind the pavements they may be bumpy (...Nice secure area, mind the pavements they may be bumpy (though getting fixed from time to time), close to NYC, tunnel takes its time but was never extreme, nice small neighborhoods, great view on NYC, nice shopping (mall, low price shops, dine-in)Show moreVGuest review byVividAustria10.0we are seniors and had been to wild wood many times. this...we are seniors and had been to wild wood many times. this was the first time in the crest and we liked it but to be fair we had plans to go to cape may for antiques and food and sunset beach. also we love the the cape may zoo. we did find a restaurant near our Aqua Beach hotel, italian, i think and it was great.Show morerGuest review byrussellUnited States10.0Cape May, NJ is a charming seaside destination that blends...Cape May, NJ is a charming seaside destination that blends Victorian elegance, coastal beauty, and a laid-back atmosphere.
