Get inspired by reviews of cities on Oahu8.0We only spent one night in Waikiki area, but it was...We only spent one night in Waikiki area, but it was considerably busier than the many other places we've been around the islands. Reminded me of Shibuya or Osaka (also in part due to affluence of Japanese tourists). We didn't visit many amenities but the beach at Waikiki was quite packed, even though we went there around 8 AM on a Monday in September (three lines of parties at all times). No major complain but not exactly the impression/expectation of the islands.Show moreMGuest review byMiguelSpain8.0We were visiting my son and daughter-in-law, who live on...We were visiting my son and daughter-in-law, who live on Wheeler Airforce base. Kapolei is 20-25 minutes from Waihiwa so they could easily come to us for dinner (hotel is next to a mall with lots of restaurant options); we were also close to Honolulu (30 minutes) and the Bishop museum; pearl harbor; Honolulu art museum; and the West beaches like Electric beach. North shore about 35-40 minutes. Kapolei is a central location away from the tourist craziness of Waikiki.Show moreEGuest review byElsaUnited States4.0The property itself is very run down and old needing a lot...The property itself is very run down and old needing a lot of love. The construction that was going on was not an issue.
The beds were extremely uncomfortable. The ac they speak of is a window unit which no where near reaches past the living room/kitchen and bed. The kitchen was not complete with decent cooking pans. I certainly would not stay here again. The only nice thing about this condo was the beach access.Show moreCGuest review byCharissa8.0Although I thought the room needed upgrading, the property...Although I thought the room needed upgrading, the property itself was lovely and the staff was great. I really enjoyed the easy-going feel of the place - just what I needed. It was often cloudy in the morning but sun came out in the afternoon. We rented a car which worked out great but they do charge a 15$ fee for parking each day. Overall I would stay again and would recommend to friends.Show morePGuest review byPloof10.0Great location, close to Halaewa (shopping, restaurants),...Great location, close to Halaewa (shopping, restaurants), beaches (3 Tables swimming, Shart Cove snorkeling), not too far from Leia (Polynesian Cultural Center, restaurants), Kahuku (amazing food trucks!!).Show moreRGuest review byRobert10.0The north shore has many beach choices.The north shore has many beach choices.

NOT Honolulu!!Very laid back and chill.
NOT Honolulu!!
We were actually right near Waimea Bay going to Haleiwa was like going to the big city.
Would be happy to visit here again.
Beaches superb and not crowded (late April).
Lots of activities, most especially swimming with sharks (One Ocean Diving). Some nice walks in the hills, too.
Another great nearby option is glider planing (Above and Beyond).Show morePGuest review byPaulUnited States10.0Beautiful beach, that was the best part.Beautiful beach, that was the best part. The prices in Hawaii are ridiculous. Very high.
The are grocery stores that you can buy your own food and cook if you have a kitchen.
Nice people. My fav was the taco truck that had such good fresh healthy food. I would eat there everyday. He was on Kihapai st and oneawa st , late in the evening. Best recommendation.
Its mostly safe, some homeless here and there not much in the residential areas. Few bars from high end, to crossroads to Kailua tavern that has the best karaoke bartender you have ever heard. He sings and makes your drinks.
Food is ok, if you are a foodies it's hit and miss.. in the restaurants..
Super fun, you can get amazing surfing cheap lessons with Mike and Andy at 808 Surt School by Kamehameha Hwy opposite of the shrimp shack.
Lot of great experiences, so much beautiful sun. Beautiful place. We'll be back.Show moreiGuest review byizabelaCanada6.0This can be a good place to stay you may have to over look...This can be a good place to stay you may have to over look some of the issues this location has. THIS IS NOT A JW MARRIOTT don't expect it. Even pricey hotels aren't perfect.
The beach is close and turtles do land on it in the evenings. The water is very shallow all the way out to the reef - probably good for beginners. This location is close to the Polynesian Cultural Center and is about the middle of all North Shore points of interest. We did not stay in the room much because we were away seeing the rest of the island during the day.Show morePGuest review byPaulUnited States8.0I think the biggest thing was the cost - the prices of food...I think the biggest thing was the cost - the prices of food and general goods have tripled since our last visit most people we spoke to said the same - I would say the visitor numbers were down possibly due to this - tours and experiences were expensive - the locals also said the same how they are struggling to live day to day.
The plastic used in Hawaii was excessive - there was nothing environmental about the place at all I did see some wildlife with lost legs and one bird had fishing twine and a bead wrapped around its leg - the poor thing was shivering but unfortunately I couldn't help it.Show moreJGuest review byJenniferNew ZealandResearch, refine, and make plans for your whole tripHotels in HaleiwaThinking about which towns and cities to visit during your trip to Oahu?
