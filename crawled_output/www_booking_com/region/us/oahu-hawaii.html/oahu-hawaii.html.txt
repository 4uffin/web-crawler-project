Reminded me of Shibuya or Osaka (also in part due to affluence of Japanese tourists). We didn't visit many amenities but the beach at Waikiki was quite packed, even though we went there around 8 AM on a Monday in September (three lines of parties at all times). No major complain but not exactly the impression/expectation of the islands.Show moreMGuest review byMiguelSpain8.0We were visiting my son and daughter-in-law, who live on...We were visiting my son and daughter-in-law, who live on Wheeler Airforce base. Kapolei is 20-25 minutes from Waihiwa so they could easily come to us for dinner (hotel is next to a mall with lots of restaurant options); we were also close to Honolulu (30 minutes) and the Bishop museum; pearl harbor; Honolulu art museum; and the West beaches like Electric beach.

The are grocery stores that you can buy your own food and cook if you have a kitchen.
Nice people. My fav was the taco truck that had such good fresh healthy food. I would eat there everyday. He was on Kihapai st and oneawa st , late in the evening. Best recommendation.
Its mostly safe, some homeless here and there not much in the residential areas. Few bars from high end, to crossroads to Kailua tavern that has the best karaoke bartender you have ever heard. He sings and makes your drinks.
Food is ok, if you are a foodies it's hit and miss.. in the restaurants..
Super fun, you can get amazing surfing cheap lessons with Mike and Andy at 808 Surt School by Kamehameha Hwy opposite of the shrimp shack.

THIS IS NOT A JW MARRIOTT don't expect it. Even pricey hotels aren't perfect.
The beach is close and turtles do land on it in the evenings. The water is very shallow all the way out to the reef - probably good for beginners. This location is close to the Polynesian Cultural Center and is about the middle of all North Shore points of interest. We did not stay in the room much because we were away seeing the rest of the island during the day.Show morePGuest review byPaulUnited States8.0I think the biggest thing was the cost - the prices of food...I think the biggest thing was the cost - the prices of food and general goods have tripled since our last visit most people we spoke to said the same - I would say the visitor numbers were down possibly due to this - tours and experiences were expensive - the locals also said the same how they are struggling to live day to day.
The plastic used in Hawaii was excessive - there was nothing environmental about the place at all I did see some wildlife with lost legs and one bird had fishing twine and a bead wrapped around its leg - the poor thing was shivering but unfortunately I couldn't help it.Show moreJGuest review byJenniferNew ZealandResearch, refine, and make plans for your whole tripWhen to visit the United StatesEvents, prices, weather – everything you need to know about the best time to visit the United States.Hotels near Honolulu AirportPerfect for a late arrival or early departure.Car rental near Honolulu AirportPick up your rental car as soon as you land.Hotels in Yosemite National ParkDiscover another popular destination in the United States.Hotels in Disney World AreaDiscover another popular destination in the United States.Hotels in the United StatesSet off to explore the whole country.Hotels in HaleiwaThinking about which towns and cities to visit during your trip to Oahu?
