It can be expensive so plan a little extra money for food though! There are plenty of things to do an see in the town and the public transport to other areas of the island are quite frequent and cheap. There are lots of steep inclines and stairs so keep that in mind, you'll be doing a lot of walking up hillsShow moreLGuest review byLawson10.0Spectacular views !!!Spectacular views !!! were there for a family wedding which took most of our time so didn't have much time to discover the surroundings , but just the walk in the center with views of buildings, churches and cliffside villas was magnificent !Show moreDGuest review byDidierFrance8.0We loved our accommodation at thousand stars and highly...We loved our accommodation at thousand stars and highly recommend it.
Took a private highlight tour of the island which was amazing.
Negatives on Kamari include swimming at the beach which was very hazardous when entering and leaving the water due to the lava levels underfoot.
Also, being constantly hassled by the same people to take a massage.Show moreDGuest review byDeirdreIreland10.0Glad I booked Imerovigli over Oia or Fira.Glad I booked Imerovigli over Oia or Fira.
It was quieter, more affordable, has amazing views and walking distance to great restaurants.
We ate at the White Lounge and La Moustache which were both fantastic.
Also easily accessible from the road without too many steps.
Highly recommend!Show moreNGuest review byNickyBAustralia10.0Perissa is a great place to stay for holiday and workcation.Perissa is a great place to stay for holiday and workcation.

Walkable to Fura though a noisy main road. Buses good too but more value for money the further you are going. Taxis quite expensive so we walked a lot.Show moreJGuest review byJulieUnited Kingdom10.0Lovely village but getting very busy.Lovely village but getting very busy.
Restaurants were excellent and staff in them very polite and attentive.
Greece is not cheap these days so you have to pay the same as in UK for meals etc.
Wine is very expensive but nice to see that they only sell Greek wine in supermarkets and restaurants.Show moreEGuest review byElaineUnited Kingdom10.0If you visit Santorini, don’t miss this village: authentic,...If you visit Santorini, don’t miss this village: authentic, charming, and far less crowded than other areas. It’s home to some of the island’s best restaurants and still keeps the true Greek atmosphere.

Beautiful and relaxing town with everything you could ask for and still without the noise from clubs until late night like in Thira!
Firostefani simply is a must to pick!Show moreMGuest review byMrMajklIreland2.0the location is not what it seams, it is just between the...the location is not what it seams, it is just between the main road and other construction sites or empty fields, with no nice view.
