Luckily, my stay at Ecozy in Canggu was on the good side.
Let my start by saying this: the breakfast is until 5 pm. How genius? I always suffer having to wake up early for the breakfast, and you can make it a brunch or a lunch.
The staff was truly friendly, Derek and Rikana were specially kind, and always had a smile in their faces, which really felt genuine.
The hotel is modern, clean and looks like new. The pool inside the room was a dream, just like in the pictures.
It’s a small hotel in front of the highway, but that’s Canggu. It’s VERY well located, close to many restaurants, the beach and all types of services.

Beautiful beach club and amazing light art installations.
Got to hold a bat at Tanah Lot - but don’t get the Gado Gado from the restaurants there.Show moreSGuest review byStaceyAustralia8.0Parts were lovely and the cliffs around the temple were...Parts were lovely and the cliffs around the temple were amazing but be prepared for lots of traffic (especially scooters) so it takes a while to get anywhere and the public bits are a bit grotty.
Couple of amazing places to eat (eg Nourish) and plenty of lovely massage options - we went to Zahra.
Highly recommend going to a sunset dance performance - absolutely amazing!Show moreNGuest review byNZ PennyNew Zealand2.0Don book this hotel. The staff is horrible.Don book this hotel. The staff is horrible. The worst is the f&b manager . The hotel is operating without a GM and no one is bothered about guest experience. Don make a mistake staying here! Don waste money as it is the worst hotel for the rate one pays. No cutleries , staff not bothered, no replenishment , just horrible in summary !Show moreKGuest review byKiranMalaysia10.0Sanur is a great holiday spot in Bali.Sanur is a great holiday spot in Bali. No noisy beach clubs and heaps of restaurants that range from high end to family owned warungs. It used to be a spot mainly for older tourists but now more and more families are visiting now as its a more laid back location.Show moreSGuest review bySimonD01Australia8.0you can see it in 2 days pretty much.you can see it in 2 days pretty much.

The western restaurants and cafes and shocking, food is rubbish, over priced, lazy staff. Filthy smokers never consider non smokers and feel it’s ok to smoke while people eat.

There are lots of nice restaurants within short walking distance to most hotels. It's not a great place for children because I'd say they'd get bored quickly, but then that's a bonus for those for us who like a quiet location.Show moreCGuest review byChrisAustraliaResearch, refine, and make plans for your whole tripHotels on BatamHit the road and make the most of your trip by discovering another popular destination in Indonesia.Hotels on LombokDiscover another popular destination in Indonesia.Hotels in IndonesiaSet off to explore the whole country.Car rental near Ngurah Rai International AirportPick up your rental car as soon as you land.Hotels near Ngurah Rai International AirportPerfect for a late arrival or early departure.Cheap vacations in SanurBook the best flights, stays, and more – all in one placeFlights to BaliGet your flight tickets to Bali right here on Booking.com.Hotels in Nusa Dua peninsulaTake a look at properties in a destination nearby.Hotels in GianyarTake a look at properties in a destination nearby.Show moreCountriesRegionsCitiesDistrictsAirportsHotelsPlaces of interestVacation HomesApartmentsResortsVillasHostelsB&BsGuest HousesUnique places to stayAll destinationsAll flight destinationsAll car rental locationsAll vacation destinationsGuidesDiscoverReviewsDiscover monthly staysSupportCoronavirus (COVID-19) FAQsManage your tripsContact Customer ServiceSafety Resource CenterDiscoverGenius loyalty programSeasonal and holiday dealsTravel articlesBooking.com for BusinessTraveller Review AwardsCar rentalFlight finderRestaurant reservationsBooking.com for Travel AgentsTerms and settingsPrivacy & cookiesTerms of ServiceAccessibility StatementDispute resolutionDon't sell or share my personal informationModern Slavery StatementHuman Rights StatementPartnersExtranet loginPartner helpList your propertyBecome an affiliateAboutAbout Booking.comHow We WorkSustainabilityPress centerCareersInvestor relationsCorporate contactUSDBooking.com is part of Booking Holdings Inc., the world leader in online travel and related services.
