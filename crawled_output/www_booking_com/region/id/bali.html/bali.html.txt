ZZeeFromCanadaWords cannot describe the experience I had here in Onaya. I stayed here for 4 nights and I could have lived here forever.
The room:
Absolutely gorgeous and clean.
From light fixtures to minimal style details - so very well thought out.
The washroom:
The dark detail was a nice touch. The shower was my favourite part.
The pool:
I just couldn’t get enough of the pool. It’s one of the most gorgeous pools I have seen. You don’t need a beach club when you have got this pool.
The location:
Everything is dispersed in Uluwatu so their free chauffeur service was helpful or you can rent bikes from them.
Last not but the least:
The staff:
I think what makes this place so magical is the staff. Everyone is so nice. I have been to so many places where they seem fake-nice but the staff here genuinely care for you. I want to give a special shout out to Debby because she’s honestly precious and a sweetheart. I was so sad to leave but I cannot wait to share about this place to my family and friends and also come back for a longer time.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.29.2Wonderful - What previous guests thought, 1,533 reviewsWonderful 1,533 reviewsLocation 8.9Price from$250.651 night, 2 adultsCheck availabilityThe Sebali ResortHotel in UbudLocated in Ubud, 3.6 miles from Ubud Palace, The Sebali Resort provides accommodations with an outdoor swimming pool, free private parking, a garden and a restaurant.

We loved the busy city and all the culture it held. We could have spent days wandering around exploring new places.

Beautiful beach club and amazing light art installations.
Got to hold a bat at Tanah Lot - but don’t get the Gado Gado from the restaurants there.Show moreSGuest review byStaceyAustralia8.0Parts were lovely and the cliffs around the temple were...Parts were lovely and the cliffs around the temple were amazing but be prepared for lots of traffic (especially scooters) so it takes a while to get anywhere and the public bits are a bit grotty.
Couple of amazing places to eat (eg Nourish) and plenty of lovely massage options - we went to Zahra.
Highly recommend going to a sunset dance performance - absolutely amazing!Show moreNGuest review byNZ PennyNew Zealand2.0Don book this hotel. The staff is horrible.Don book this hotel. The staff is horrible. The worst is the f&b manager . The hotel is operating without a GM and no one is bothered about guest experience. Don make a mistake staying here! Don waste money as it is the worst hotel for the rate one pays. No cutleries , staff not bothered, no replenishment , just horrible in summary !Show moreKGuest review byKiranMalaysia10.0Sanur is a great holiday spot in Bali.Sanur is a great holiday spot in Bali. No noisy beach clubs and heaps of restaurants that range from high end to family owned warungs. It used to be a spot mainly for older tourists but now more and more families are visiting now as its a more laid back location.Show moreSGuest review bySimonD01Australia8.0you can see it in 2 days pretty much.you can see it in 2 days pretty much.

Possibly the establishment of an organisation ?volunteer or ?commercial to recycle plastics (bottles)
could certainly assist in recycling some of the plastics. There was one eating establishment which was doing it's very best to get the message across about limiting / recycling plastics!Show morepGuest review bypaulineAustralia10.0I love Legian, the beach is magic.I love Legian, the beach is magic. The western restaurants and cafes and shocking, food is rubbish, over priced, lazy staff. Filthy smokers never consider non smokers and feel it’s ok to smoke while people eat. They ruin this townShow moreDGuest review byDanielleAustralia4.0We spent two nights at the end of our holiday in this area.We spent two nights at the end of our holiday in this area.
It was not for us.
The area is dominated by large resorts and the main activities centre around surfing, or hanging out in a pricey resort/bar, or perhaps viewing artifical tourist sights.
Admittedly some resorts are very nice and have nice views but it's not really my style of holiday to spend several hundred dollars to lounge on a sunbed on the coast.
There are plenty of higher end places to eat in this area, but I didn't go to Indonesia to eat western food.
The Indonesian options feel very samey and were better in other areas with more Indonesian diners.
Even Ubud with its hordes of people felt more authentically like Bali than this area does.
In all, if you want a resort style holiday or are a wealthy surfer then this is the area for you.
If you want to mosey around and get a feel for Bali it is not.
For other watersports, it would be better to go north e.g. for diving/snorkelling.
Or go to another island altogether.Show moreAGuest review byAlexanderNew ZealandResearch, refine, and make plans for your whole tripCheap vacations in SanurPlan everything you need for your vacation in one place – from flights and stays to tours and activitiesHotels on BatamDiscover another popular destination in Indonesia.Hotels on LombokDiscover another popular destination in Indonesia.Hotels in IndonesiaSet off to explore the whole country.Car rental near Ngurah Rai International AirportPick up your rental car as soon as you land.Hotels near Ngurah Rai International AirportPerfect for a late arrival or early departure.Flights to BaliGet your flight tickets to Bali right here on Booking.com.Hotels near Mount BaturPlaces to stay with a popular tourist attraction nearby.Hotels near Tegallalang Rice TerracePlaces to stay with a popular tourist attraction nearby.Show moreCountriesRegionsCitiesDistrictsAirportsHotelsPlaces of interestVacation HomesApartmentsResortsVillasHostelsB&BsGuest HousesUnique places to stayAll destinationsAll flight destinationsAll car rental locationsAll vacation destinationsGuidesDiscoverReviewsDiscover monthly staysSupportCoronavirus (COVID-19) FAQsManage your tripsContact Customer ServiceSafety Resource CenterDiscoverGenius loyalty programSeasonal and holiday dealsTravel articlesBooking.com for BusinessTraveller Review AwardsCar rentalFlight finderRestaurant reservationsBooking.com for Travel AgentsTerms and settingsPrivacy & cookiesTerms of ServiceAccessibility StatementDispute resolutionDon't sell or share my personal informationModern Slavery StatementHuman Rights StatementPartnersExtranet loginPartner helpList your propertyBecome an affiliateAboutAbout Booking.comHow We WorkSustainabilityPress centerCareersInvestor relationsCorporate contactUSDBooking.com is part of Booking Holdings Inc., the world leader in online travel and related services.
