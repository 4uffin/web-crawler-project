Free cancellation up to 48 hours before pick-up time on most bookings.What do I need to rent a car?When you’re booking a car, all you need is a debit or credit card. At the rental counter, you’ll need:
Your passport Your voucher A driver’s license for each driver The main driver’s credit card (some companies accept debit cards, but most don’t).
Important: Check the car’s rental terms as well, because each company has its own rules. For example, they might need to see extra ID, might not accept certain types of credit cards, or might not rent to anybody who hasn’t held their driver's license for 36 months, etc.Am I old enough to rent a car?Most companies will let you rent a car if you’re at least 21, and some will even rent to younger drivers. However, if you’re under 25, you might have to pay a "young driver fee."Can I book a rental car for someone else?Of course. Just put their info on the "Driver details" form when booking the car.Any tips for picking the right car? Think about where you’re going. An SUV might be great for cruising down a Texas freeway, but a smaller car will be a lot easier for getting around Rome. See what other people think. You’ll find lots of reviews and ratings on our site, so check out what other customers liked (and didn’t like) about each company. Don’t forget the transmission. In some countries, almost everyone drives manual cars, while automatics are the norm in other ones. Make sure you rent a car you can drive! Are all fees included in the rental price?The price you see includes the car, mandatory coverage (e.g. Theft Protection, Collision Damage Waiver), and fees that, if they apply, are usually payable at pick-up (e.g. any one-way fees, airport surcharges, or local taxes). It also includes any extras you already added (e.g. GPS, baby seats). It doesn’t include any extra coverage you buy when you get to the rental counter. Tip: There’s a full price breakdown on the Payment page.Popular car rental destinationsExplore more options to rent a car for cheapCities in the United StatesAirports in the United StatesRegions in
