Guest reviewEverything was exceptional!
Driving to this place made us a little apprehensive, but after parking, the warm
inviting ochre stucco walls and noren entry allayed all concerns.
This a consumate Japanese fusion experience.
Everything from the engaging reception to the artfully refurbished room and personal hinoki bath meant pure relaxation.
Then there was the dinner which unfolded like a traditional Kaiseki meal, but contained the most inventive and delicious dishes.
