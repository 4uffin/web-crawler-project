Didn't expect that there would be coffee, tea, juice, wine and pastries at the lobby so it made waiting very comfortable. We were able to check in even if it was just 30 mins earlier. Pajamas were a nice touch.

Wonderful

Beppu Hatto Onyado Nono Beppu is located in Beppu, 13 miles from Oita Bank Dome and 7.5 miles from Oita Station. Featuring a restaurant, the 3-star hotel has air-conditioned rooms with free WiFi.
Comfortable but with very tiny rooms.
Unusual experience {which we liked}
for
a big hotel is that you must not wear shoes at any place in the hotel.
All floors are carpeted with tatami mats, which are beautiful, but since this hotel caters a lot to tour groups, the front doors become jammed when a bus comes in and people must remove their shoes.
Tour groups also bottleneck at the elevators and restaurant.
Breakfasts looked great, but we wouldn't go when tours were lined up.
Excellent coffee always available.
Outdoor onsen was tiny (maybe 3 meters by 3 meters).
Indoor onsen was large enough, but not hot enough.
Great location with lots of restaurants nearby.
Fantastic English-speaking staff.
Dormy's HR Dept know their stuff.
We'd stay again, despite the small rooms and small onsen. Visit the very old downtown onsen, Takegawara, , a must, and the seafront walk,
Good bakery (Mermaid) at the train station. Liveely downtown area.
