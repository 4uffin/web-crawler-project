Guest reviewEverything was exceptional!
Driving to this place made us a little apprehensive, but after parking, the warm
inviting ochre stucco walls and noren entry allayed all concerns.
This a consumate Japanese fusion experience.
Everything from the engaging reception to the artfully refurbished room and personal hinoki bath meant pure relaxation.
Then there was the dinner which unfolded like a traditional Kaiseki meal, but contained the most inventive and delicious dishes.

Guest reviewThis hotel is an absolute gem.
My wife and I stayed there the very last night of a three week trip to Japan, and it was probably the single best hotel we stayed in. What really stood out was the staff and atmosphere.
Even in a country known for solicitous customer service Hotel Kanazawa Zoushi is exceptional.
Very warm and welcoming staff, so many little touches that showed they really care: welcome treat, free drinks in the room instead of nickel and diming you for money,
ramen late evening, a personalized little gift on departure.
The room itself was spotlessly clean and very modern. Beds were so comfortable that I was very sad we had an early train the next morning.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.69.6Exceptional - What previous guests thought, 1,949 reviews Exceptional · 1,949 reviewsFrom $149 per nightHotel Yuraku Kyo-yasakaHotel in Higashiyama Ward, KyotoLocated in Kyoto, within a 11-minute walk of Gion Shijo Station and 0.8 miles of Samurai Kembu Kyoto, Hotel Yuraku Kyo-yasaka provides accommodations with a shared lounge and free WiFi throughout the...Guest reviewHUGE SPACIOUS ROOM! TOOTHBRUSHES BIGGER THAN AVERAGE TOOTHBRUSH! I'm 6 feet 2 inches so they gave me a larger bathrobe, or maybe it was called yukata. It was our honeymoon and they treated us so well. They also had a lot of other free amenities in the restroom that I can't think of, but I know my wife took all of it. I can't remember if I added breakfast or if it was included, but it was worth it. Super delicious Japanese meal that made us both very full to start our day.

Guest reviewThis is the BEST hotel we’ve stayed at so far during our month-long trip in Japan.
We had been to Kyoto before (and stayed at a 5-star property), but I can confidently say that Hotel Muso is far superior!
•	It’s modern.
•	Spotlessly clean.
•	Offers dozens of thoughtful amenities, including complimentary bottled water in generous quantities. (For comparison, we’re currently at a Hilton in another city where we receive two bottles per day. At Hotel Muso, we were provided double that amount, along with many small gifts like face masks, soothing oils for the skin and hair, etc.). Their attention to detail is unmatched in my opinion.
•	The shower is the best we’ve ever experienced, with incredible water pressure.
•	The comfortable, high-tech toilet (a standard in Japan) even plays classical music while in use.
The location is also superb—within walking distance of many attractions and conveniently close to bus stops.
Let me know if you’d like further tweaks!Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.79.7Exceptional - What previous guests thought, 654 reviews Exceptional · 654 reviewsFrom $217 per nightMost booked hotels in Japan in the past monthSee allAPA Hotel Higashi Shinjuku Kabukicho TowerHotel in Shinjuku Ward, TokyoPopular with guests booking hotels in TokyoScored out of 10, guest rating 8.18.1Very Good - What previous guests thought, 22,032 reviews Very Good · 22,032 reviewsNarita Tobu Hotel AirportHotel in NaritaPopular with guests booking hotels in NaritaScored out of 10, guest rating 8.38.3Very Good - What previous guests thought, 24,152 reviews Very Good · 24,152 reviewsVilla Fontaine Grand Haneda AirportHotel in Ota Ward, TokyoPopular with guests booking hotels in TokyoScored out of 10, guest rating 8.78.7Excellent - What previous guests thought, 19,320 reviews Excellent · 19,320 reviewsHotel Gracery ShinjukuHotel in Shinjuku Ward, TokyoPopular with guests booking hotels in TokyoScored out of 10, guest rating 8.38.3Very Good - What previous guests thought, 11,328 reviews Very Good · 11,328 reviewsAPA Hotel & Resort Yokohama Bay TowerHotel in Naka Ward, YokohamaPopular with guests booking hotels in YokohamaScored out of 10, guest rating 8.28.2Very Good - What previous guests thought, 23,835 reviews Very Good · 23,835 reviewsToyo HotelHotel in Hakata Ward, FukuokaPopular with guests booking hotels in FukuokaScored out of 10, guest rating 8.08.0Very Good - What previous guests thought, 11,490 reviews Very Good · 11,490 reviewsAPA Hotel & Resort Osaka Namba Ekimae TowerHotel in OsakaPopular with guests booking hotels in OsakaScored out of 10, guest rating 8.38.3Very Good - What previous guests thought, 6,652 reviews Very Good · 6,652 reviewsAPA Hotel & Resort Ryogoku Eki TowerHotel in Sumida Ward, TokyoPopular with guests booking hotels in TokyoScored out of 10, guest rating 8.28.2Very Good - What previous guests thought, 16,879 reviews Very Good · 16,879 reviewsToyoko Inn Narita Airport ShinkanHotel in NaritaPopular with guests booking hotels in NaritaScored out of 10, guest rating 8.38.3Very Good - What previous guests thought, 13,435 reviews Very Good · 13,435 reviewsHotel Hankyu RESPIRE OSAKAHotel in OsakaPopular with guests booking hotels in OsakaScored out of 10, guest rating 8.58.5Very Good - What previous guests thought, 9,911 reviews Very Good · 9,911 reviewsFly to the most popular airportsTokyo International Airport (HND)Tokyo, JapanNarita International Airport (NRT)Tokyo, JapanKansai International Airport (KIX)Osaka, JapanFukuoka Airport (FUK)Fukuoka, JapanChubu Centrair International Airport (NGO)Nagoya, JapanNew Chitose Airport (CTS)Sapporo, JapanItami Airport (ITM)Osaka, JapanHiroshima Airport (HIJ)Hiroshima, JapanKagoshima Airport (KOJ)Kagoshima, JapanNaha Airport (OKA)Naha, JapanKitakyushu Airport (KKJ)Kitakyushu, JapanNagasaki Airport (NGS)Nagasaki, JapanResearch, refine, and make plans for your whole tripCar rental near Tokyo International AirportFlying in to Tokyo International Airport and need to rent a car?
