Lovely
hotel. Right down the end of Banff Ave so away from the busy part of town, but local bus stops right outside (free bus pass is provided by the hotel) and the free ski shuttle to 3 mountains is just across the road. The hot pools were amazing, such a beautiful setting. Nice sauna, no cold plunge pool but standing outside in the snow is a quick way to cool off. Good cafe/restaurant on site.
Spacious bedroom with plenty of daylight and balcony.
Nice touches like a feature wall which is a map of the region and canoe shaped drawer handles.
