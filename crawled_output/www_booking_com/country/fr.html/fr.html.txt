This hotel has a year-round outdoor pool and spa center. Guest reviewWhere do I begin? Pascal and his team have made our trip to Le Thor one we will never forget. What a great host and absolutely the prime location if you want to experience the countryside of France. The rooms are huge and cozy, they feel like royalty rooms. The breakfast included was amazing: fruits, yogurt, bread, etc. Definitely worth it to pay extra for the spa - it just adds so much to the overall experience. Lastly, Pascal made sure we had the best stay - we didn’t have a car so he helped arrange for our cabs and restaurants. We feel very nostalgic looking back at our stay. If there is an accommodation that has set a high standard for us - it is Les Carmes.

Laurie and Dorian provided personalized service that went above and beyond, making every moment unforgettable. The property itself is an enchanting old convent with a rich history dating back to the Hundred Years' War. Laurie dedicated more than a year to researching the story of the place, diving into historical archives to uncover its fascinating past, which she shared with us during our stay.
Perfectly located near the best towns in the region, Château Maraval is a haven of tranquility. The stars at night are breathtaking, and the serene forest brings deer right to your view as you enjoy breakfast. Laurie and Dorian truly made our anniversary unforgettable by filling the room with roses and helping us secure reservations at top spots.
Château Maraval is not just a stay; it’s an extraordinary experience of history, beauty, and unmatched hospitality.
