9.6
Exceptional
1,526 reviews
In a prime location in Hanoi, CLASSYC Hotel provides air-conditioned rooms, an outdoor swimming pool, free WiFi and a fitness center.
Wonderful place.
Great rooms - spacious and with thought-out details and nice little touches all around. Clean and bright and comforting rooms.
Very good location - right in the middle of the old quarter, and almost next to the lake. Great food, coffee, shopping, sightseeing close by. Start off with a food tour on your day one to acquaint yourself.
Best was the very good service - Alex and the reservation team exchanged almost 20 mails patiently with me for our group of 9; did everything we requested and more, especially helping with getting our rooms ready for the babies early, upgrading a room, and doing a lot of extra things; helping us out throughout - from the doormen to the manager to all - very good - best service in our Vietnam trip!
It's a new place, but no teething issues of a new place. Rather all the benefits. We had the penthouse
suite which was a steal for the size and the view and the facilities, a grand suite and a junior suite all were very good.
