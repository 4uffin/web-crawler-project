Ella and the staff spoke great English and really helped us, a tyfoon ripped apart the south which meant da nang airport closed so our entire holiday plan was then ruined/ cancelled, but being stuck in Hanoi for 5 days Ella provided us accommodation and made use of our time with a great tour to ha long bay, for the prices around this hotel is defiantly worth it at what it’s priced at compared to others, think we paid £27 for first night then £31ish for each other but easily worth it for aircon and good service, left our bags here to to go and do the loop up north on the bikes

That was the best hotel on our 4 week trip to Vietnam. Everything was clean and comfortable, the pool was great and the staff was exceptionally forthcoming and kind.

CLASSYC Hotel

9.6
Exceptional
1,522 reviews
In a prime location in Hanoi, CLASSYC Hotel provides air-conditioned rooms, an outdoor swimming pool, free WiFi and a fitness center.
Wonderful place.
Great rooms - spacious and with thought-out details and nice little touches all around. Clean and bright and comforting rooms.
Very good location - right in the middle of the old quarter, and almost next to the lake. Great food, coffee, shopping, sightseeing close by. Start off with a food tour on your day one to acquaint yourself.
Best was the very good service - Alex and the reservation team exchanged almost 20 mails patiently with me for our group of 9; did everything we requested and more, especially helping with getting our rooms ready for the babies early, upgrading a room, and doing a lot of extra things; helping us out throughout - from the doormen to the manager to all - very good - best service in our Vietnam trip!
It's a new place, but no teething issues of a new place. Rather all the benefits. We had the penthouse
suite which was a steal for the size and the view and the facilities, a grand suite and a junior suite all were very good.
