HOTEL DELLE CIVETTE
Hotel in Nomentano, Rome
9.0
Wonderful
1,272 reviews
Located in Rome, a 9-minute walk from Bologna Metro Station, HOTEL DELLE CIVETTE provides accommodations with a garden, private parking, a shared lounge and a terrace.
I had an amazing experience at this hotel! The staff were incredibly friendly, welcoming, and always ready to help with a smile. The room was spotless, beautifully decorated, and very comfortable — everything I needed for a relaxing stay. The location is perfect, close to key attractions but still peaceful and quiet at night.
Breakfast was delicious with plenty of variety, and the restaurant/bar had a great atmosphere. I also loved the little touches — from the cozy lobby to the attention to detail in the service.
Highly recommend this place for anyone looking for comfort, style, and great service. I will definitely be coming back!

Every thing about the Hotel was far above our expectations. We were only staying for the one night and it was ideal for us be based there and a short drive into the centre of town where we experienced the atmosphere which was very vibrant on a Sunday afternoon.
We may now come back for a longer stay next time.
