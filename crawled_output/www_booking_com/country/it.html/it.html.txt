What was meant to be a three-night stay quickly turned into four, because everything was so wonderful — we simply didn’t want to leave.
Here are a few of our favorite things about Monteverdi:
First, the location and views. Each morning, we went on long hikes through the rolling Tuscan hills, soaking in the breathtaking scenery of this UNESCO-protected landscape. Every evening, we watched the sunset in peaceful awe. Time slows down here — and you truly learn to savor each moment.
Second, the food. Every single meal was exceptional. The team sources fresh, local ingredients and crafts them into dishes that are both comforting and inspired. We looked forward to breakfast every morning, trying something new each time. And dinner? Even better. Riccardo and his team curated a seasonal menu that we absolutely loved — and since we dined there nearly every night, they even created a few special off-menu dishes just for us, which was such a memorable touch.
Third, the experiences. From wine tasting at Le Ripi to day trips through charming nearby towns, there’s so much to explore. We also made time to relax at the property — the pool, sauna, and spa treatments were some of the best we’ve ever experienced.
And above all, the people. Every member of the Monteverdi team was warm, welcoming, and genuinely dedicated to making us feel at home. Their hospitality created a space where we could truly unwind and be present.
Monteverdi is a place that stays with you — and we’re already counting down the days until we return.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.89.8Exceptional - What previous guests thought, 29 reviews Exceptional · 29 reviewsFrom $977 per nightMaalot Roma - Small Luxury Hotels of the WorldHotel in Trevi, RomeLocated in Rome and with Trevi Fountain reachable within a few steps, Maalot Roma - Small Luxury Hotels of the World provides concierge services, non-smoking rooms, a fitness center, free WiFi...Guest reviewObviously everyone stresses the location, which is great. To us the key difference between Maalot and other Roman hotels, including those well established and grande dames is staff. Maalot team is truly wonderful, very professional but warm and always helpful. There is no task too difficult to manage by the team.
It would be unfair to single out only one person as ALL staff is wonderful but I need to mention Eleonora who save our holidays twice.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.89.8Exceptional - What previous guests thought, 830 reviews Exceptional · 830 reviewsFrom $857 per nightCastello di Casalborgone, Luxury Italian Castle HotelHotel in CasalborgoneLocated in Casalborgone, 21 miles from Mole Antonelliana, Castello di Casalborgone, Luxury Italian Castle Hotel has accommodations with a garden, free private parking, a terrace and a restaurant.
