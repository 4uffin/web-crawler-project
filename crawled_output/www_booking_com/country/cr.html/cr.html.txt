Guest reviewLapazul is an absolute gem—easily one of the most memorable places I’ve stayed at anywhere in the world. The views are simply breathtaking, perched high in the jungle with the ocean in the distance, and the chance to spot local wildlife adds to the magic. The rooms are spacious, beautifully designed, and have everything you need to truly relax.
But what really sets Lapazul apart is the top-notch hospitality. The warmth and attention to detail from the staff is among the best I’ve ever experienced—genuine, personal, and truly caring. Special mention to Mr. Jorge, whose first-class service and warm presence made us feel incredibly welcome. He is, without a doubt, one of the best hosts I’ve ever encountered at any hotel in the world.
And the food? Outstanding. Every dish is full of flavor and heart, far surpassing the local restaurants in town. The menu is focused and perfectly executed, with ingredients that shine. You can taste the passion in every bite.
If you’re looking to disconnect from the world and reconnect with nature and comfort, this is the place. Plus, it’s just a short drive down to the beach at Dominical. I can’t recommend it enough.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.89.8Exceptional - What previous guests thought, 79 reviews Exceptional · 79 reviewsFrom $342 per nightHotel Casa Buenavista - Adults onlyHotel in SámaraCasa Buenavista is located in Carrillo, 984 feet from the beach.

The design of the hotel is well planned with 8 rooms surrounding the pool and garden, with delightful sitting area in the courtyard right outside of the rooms, as well as lounge chairs around the pool in the garden. There is excellent sound proof walls, so we did not hear the neighbours, but design is great so that guests could enjoy the company of others if they chose to. The rooms were beautifully simple, comfortable beds with the best linens we have ever had at a hotel, and very spacious so that we could easily do yoga inside or outside whichever we decided to. It is a family run business, and the owners are very organized and cleanliness is a 10+, and moreover they are so friendly and helpful in every way.
If we could we would stay there much longer as we liked the setting, the rooms were so comfortable, we enjoyed the pool in the evenings and the owners were so helpful and kind.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.69.6Exceptional - What previous guests thought, 272 reviews Exceptional · 272 reviewsFrom $140 per nightMost booked hotels in Costa Rica in the past monthSee allFiesta Resort All Inclusive Central Pacific - Costa RicaHotel in El RoblePopular with guests booking hotels in El RobleScored out of 10, guest rating 8.18.1Very Good - What previous guests thought, 5,442 reviews Very Good · 5,442 reviewsHotel Los Lagos Spa & ResortHotel in FortunaPopular with guests booking hotels in FortunaScored out of 10, guest rating 9.09.0Wonderful - What previous guests thought, 4,331 reviews Wonderful · 4,331 reviewsCosta Rica BackpackersHotel in San JoséPopular with guests booking hotels in San JoséScored out of 10, guest rating 7.87.8Good - What previous guests thought, 3,748 reviews Good · 3,748 reviewsHostel PlinioHotel in Manuel AntonioPopular with guests booking hotels in Manuel AntonioScored out of 10, guest rating 8.18.1Very Good - What previous guests thought, 1,462 reviews Very Good · 1,462 reviewsRadisson San Jose-Costa RicaHotel in San JoséPopular with guests booking hotels in San JoséScored out of 10, guest rating 8.08.0Very Good - What previous guests thought, 2,560 reviews Very Good · 2,560 reviewsHotel NovoHotel in San JoséPopular with guests booking hotels in San JoséScored out of 10, guest rating 8.18.1Very Good - What previous guests thought, 2,451 reviews Very Good · 2,451 reviewsCosta Rica GuesthouseHotel in San JoséPopular with guests booking hotels in San JoséScored out of 10, guest rating 8.28.2Very Good - What previous guests thought, 2,698 reviews Very Good · 2,698 reviewsEl Faro Containers Beach HotelHotel in Manuel AntonioPopular with guests booking hotels in Manuel AntonioScored out of 10, guest rating 8.48.4Very Good - What previous guests thought, 2,638 reviews Very Good · 2,638 reviewsFairfield by Marriott San Jose Airport AlajuelaHotel in AlajuelaPopular with guests booking hotels in AlajuelaScored out of 10, guest rating 8.78.7Excellent - What previous guests thought, 3,846 reviews Excellent · 3,846 reviewsUrban Green Hotel & SuitesHotel in San JoséPopular with guests booking hotels in San JoséScored out of 10, guest rating 8.08.0Very Good - What previous guests thought, 2,967 reviews Very Good · 2,967 reviewsFly to the most popular airportsJuan Santamaría International Airport (SJO)San José, Costa RicaDaniel Oduber Quirós International Airport (LIR)Liberia, Costa RicaResearch, refine, and make plans for your whole tripHostels in Costa RicaStill looking for the perfect place to stay?
