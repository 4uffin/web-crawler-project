The design of the hotel is well planned with 8 rooms surrounding the pool and garden, with delightful sitting area in the courtyard right outside of the rooms, as well as lounge chairs around the pool in the garden. There is excellent sound proof walls, so we did not hear the neighbours, but design is great so that guests could enjoy the company of others if they chose to. The rooms were beautifully simple, comfortable beds with the best linens we have ever had at a hotel, and very spacious so that we could easily do yoga inside or outside whichever we decided to. It is a family run business, and the owners are very organized and cleanliness is a 10+, and moreover they are so friendly and helpful in every way.
If we could we would stay there much longer as we liked the setting, the rooms were so comfortable, we enjoyed the pool in the evenings and the owners were so helpful and kind.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.69.6Exceptional - What previous guests thought, 272 reviews Exceptional · 272 reviewsFrom $140 per nightMost booked hotels in Costa Rica in the past monthSee allFiesta Resort All Inclusive Central Pacific - Costa RicaHotel in El RoblePopular with guests booking hotels in El RobleScored out of 10, guest rating 8.18.1Very Good - What previous guests thought, 5,443 reviews Very Good · 5,443 reviewsHotel Los Lagos Spa & ResortHotel in FortunaPopular with guests booking hotels in FortunaScored out of 10, guest rating 9.09.0Wonderful - What previous guests thought, 4,331 reviews Wonderful · 4,331 reviewsCosta Rica BackpackersHotel in San JoséPopular with guests booking hotels in San JoséScored out of 10, guest rating 7.87.8Good - What previous guests thought, 3,748 reviews Good · 3,748 reviewsHostel PlinioHotel in Manuel AntonioPopular with guests booking hotels in Manuel AntonioScored out of 10, guest rating 8.18.1Very Good - What previous guests thought, 1,462 reviews Very Good · 1,462 reviewsRadisson San Jose-Costa RicaHotel in San JoséPopular with guests booking hotels in San JoséScored out of 10, guest rating 8.08.0Very Good - What previous guests thought, 2,557 reviews Very Good · 2,557 reviewsHotel NovoHotel in San JoséPopular with guests booking hotels in San JoséScored out of 10, guest rating 8.18.1Very Good - What previous guests thought, 2,454 reviews Very Good · 2,454 reviewsCosta Rica GuesthouseHotel in San JoséPopular with guests booking hotels in San JoséScored out of 10, guest rating 8.28.2Very Good - What previous guests thought, 2,700 reviews Very Good · 2,700 reviewsEl Faro Containers Beach HotelHotel in Manuel AntonioPopular with guests booking hotels in Manuel AntonioScored out of 10, guest rating 8.48.4Very Good - What previous guests thought, 2,638 reviews Very Good · 2,638 reviewsFairfield by Marriott San Jose Airport AlajuelaHotel in AlajuelaPopular with guests booking hotels in AlajuelaScored out of 10, guest rating 8.78.7Excellent - What previous guests thought, 3,847 reviews Excellent · 3,847 reviewsUrban Green Hotel & SuitesHotel in San JoséPopular with guests booking hotels in San JoséScored out of 10, guest rating 8.08.0Very Good - What previous guests thought, 2,968 reviews Very Good · 2,968 reviewsFly to the most popular airportsJuan Santamaría International Airport (SJO)San José, Costa RicaDaniel Oduber Quirós International Airport (LIR)Liberia, Costa RicaResearch, refine, and make plans for your whole tripHotels in the United StatesAlready thinking about your next trip?
