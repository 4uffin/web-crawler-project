Centrally located in Puerto Viejo de Talamanca town center and just a 3-minute walk from Salsa Brava Beach, Hotel Indalo adults only features an extensive garden, sun terrace and free Wi-Fi.
Really comfortable and private hotel for a great price in Puerto Viejo. We loved the size and layout of the room, the patio area and the pool was a nice bonus. It was close to everything but far enough that there was no traffic noise or music from the local clubs. Filtered water and coffee offered daily was great and the staff were friendly and helpful.

Discover the charm of Hotel Secreto La Fortuna, a quiet retreat in the heart of Fortuna, Costa Rica.
The staff were very friendly, always had time to chat and talk about the area, show animals they had spotted on the property. We saw the sloth that lives in the trees near the entrance, iguanas, frogs.
The gardens at the hotel are an array of colours full
of unusual plants and birds.
The accomadation was very comfortable, large bed big bathroom. There was a place to sit outside at the end of the day to relax and remember the activities of the day and plan the day ahead.
The pool was great when u returned after a day trip.
Breakfast was included and it was a great start to the day. Selection of items available, fruit, eggs, pancakes with bacon. All was wonderful

Nice pool at the hotel and it’s also great that you get access to the thermal pools at the sister hotel. It’s within walking distance to lots of restaurants. We really enjoyed our stay.
