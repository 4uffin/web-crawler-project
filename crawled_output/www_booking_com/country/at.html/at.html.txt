The property has a 24-hour front desk, airport transportation, a tour desk and free WiFi. Guest reviewI had an absolutely delightful stay at Hotel Traube! From the moment I arrived, I felt warmly welcomed by the friendly and attentive staff. The hotel is located perfectly in the center of Rattenberg, a charming little village, making it incredibly easy to explore the historic streets, stroll along the river, browse the quaint shops, and soak up the views. I was pleasantly surprised by the number of nice restaurants, bakeries and supermarkets within walking distance.
My room was immaculate, and well-equipped with everything I needed. The bed was super comfortable, and I really appreciated the peaceful atmosphere - perfect for a restful night’s sleep.
Breakfast was a highlight: fresh, local ingredients and a lovely selection of tea / coffee. The traditional charm of the building combined with modern comfort made this a truly memorable experience for me.
I highly recommend Hotel Traube to anyone visiting the Tyrol region. Whether you’re here for the scenery, culture, or just a relaxing getaway, this hotel is a fantastic choice. I’ll definitely be back!Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 10.010.0Exceptional - What previous guests thought, 11 reviews Exceptional · 11 reviewsFrom $249 per nightMost booked hotels in Austria in the past monthSee allLeonardo Hotel Vienna City WestHotel in 15.
