Guest reviewOur group of friends stayed in three rooms (one with a small dog) and had a wonderful experience.
The location is great, with a fun little nigthlife on Saturday night in addition to hiking, skiing and spa.
The spa was recently renovated, super clean, and well maintained. I enjoyed a relaxing massage. Our room was spotless, with a comfortable bed and
beautiful views.
Breakfast was excellent –
eggs, waffles, and pastries were all great, so was the dinner – I had a perfectly cooked steak.
Parking was easy, and I was able to charge my car without any issues.
Thank you, Posthotel Taube Team, for a truly enjoyable stay!Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.69.6Exceptional - What previous guests thought, 325 reviews Exceptional · 325 reviewsFrom $425 per nightMost booked hotels in Austria in the past monthSee allLeonardo Hotel Vienna City WestHotel in 15.
