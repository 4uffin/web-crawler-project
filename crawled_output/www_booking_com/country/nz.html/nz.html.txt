Location in the Arts Centre was great with shops a lovely restaurants and a cafe. Sadly the antiquities museum was closed Mon - Tue. Also the museum tram has its stop very close.
Keep up the service-minded spirit. Thank you! ‚ô•Ô∏èüá´üáÆ

Wonderful

Conveniently set in Christchurch, Drifter Christchurch provides air-conditioned rooms, a shared lounge, free WiFi and a terrace.
It's definitely a five star top of the range hostel/hotel. Everything is new, and spotlessly clean. The staff are excellent, and the location is bang in the middle of town next to all the transport links. I can't fault it, it's truly the best I've ever been in. Davy
