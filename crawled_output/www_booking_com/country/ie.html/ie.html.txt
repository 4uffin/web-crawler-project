Zanzibar Locke
Hotel in Dublin City Centre, Dublin
9.0
Wonderful
3,646 reviews
Featuring a fitness center, a garden as well as a terrace, Zanzibar Locke is located in the center of Dublin, a 5-minute walk from The City Hall.
I stayed in a studio apartment where kitchenette facilities were brilliant and saved me a lot from eating out.
Room was extremely clean and I LIKED that it didn't have daily housekeeping and we could simply request this as needed.
The staff were at the ready all the time to assist with anything (including daily service if you wish for it).
Location is on the 'quiet' side of Temple Bar district, so easy access to all sites (everything <15 mins walk) but it was cosy and quiet for sleeping.
