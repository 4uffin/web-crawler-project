Wonderful

Beautiful, clean, fresh smell of wood in the room. The shower was excellent. The entire facility is beautiful and clean with great service on top of a mountain in Switzerland. The funicular that brings you up to the lodge is so cool with the best views. There is a parking lot at the bottom of the mountain at the funicalar entrance for 14 francs/day. The lodge is right next to the funicular. The breakfast buffet is really good quality extra charge. Beautiful hiking trails.

Wonderful
1,099 reviews
Located in Locarno and with Piazza Grande Locarno reachable within a 7-minute walk, Villa Rossella provides a terrace, non-smoking rooms, free WiFi throughout the property and a bar.
The staff were beyond friendly and helpful. Their cheeriness was infectious. A true asset to whoever owns the hotel. The room was very well appointed and decorated. Bathroom and shower were very good and spotlessly clean. Because of our travel plans, we didn't have breakfast but the garden/dinning area was also very well appointed. Would definitely stay here again.
