Wonderful

Beautiful, clean, fresh smell of wood in the room. The shower was excellent. The entire facility is beautiful and clean with great service on top of a mountain in Switzerland. The funicular that brings you up to the lodge is so cool with the best views. There is a parking lot at the bottom of the mountain at the funicalar entrance for 14 francs/day. The lodge is right next to the funicular. The breakfast buffet is really good quality extra charge. Beautiful hiking trails.
