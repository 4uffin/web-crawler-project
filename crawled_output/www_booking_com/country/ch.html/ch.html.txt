Guest reviewThe staff was exceptionally friendly and welcoming. The food was superb. We throughly enjoyed the fireplace in our junior suite which was spacious, warm, and inviting. Every little detail was thought of from hooks in the right places to enough hangars to coffee pods. The hotel is beautifully decorated, reflecting its long history. It's obvious that the family is very proud of their hotel and deservedly so.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.89.8Exceptional - What previous guests thought, 53 reviews Exceptional · 53 reviewsFrom $492 per nightHotel Krone RegensbergHotel in RegensbergLocated in Regensberg, 10 miles from Swiss National Museum, Hotel Krone Regensberg provides accommodations with free bikes, private parking, a shared lounge and a terrace.

Guest reviewSecluded in the top of Engelberg in the last street, Villa Hundert’s location is very romantic. When you enter the building, you immediately feel the owners’ touch and soul in everything what’s inside. What Christian and John built here is truly outstanding. It is a full experience and journey, starting with the accessories in the room, the common living room upstairs, and then the main attraction: food and wine. We had quite a few gastronomic experiences with my wife so far, but John’s cuisine paired with Christian’s wine sortiment topped everything we ever experienced. The ski bus has a stop right under Villa Hundert, so transportation to the Titlis cablecar is easy. Highly recommended for everyone, who’s looking for a unique and special experience, paired with skiing or snowboarding. This is the perfect choice for a romantic weekend. We will definitely come back!Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.99.9Exceptional - What previous guests thought, 81 reviews Exceptional · 81 reviewsFrom $688 per nightNavigare ResortsHotel in Saas-FeeLocated within 10 miles of Allalin Glacier and 27 miles of Zermatt Train Station, Navigare Resorts provides rooms in Saas-Fee.
