Guest reviewMy wife and I stayed in Albatroz for our honeymoon.
It is hard to explain how beautiful and perfect everything was. From kindness of the staff, the food, the beautiful nature and beautiful resort facilities it is hard to point out the best thing.
Hotel is amazingly quiet, despite being close to the airport. Both pools are great, and the view from the cliffs is unreal.
The restaurant is top notch, and they serve variety of local dishes and amazing fresh fish.
Internet was great, and all amenities as well.
We will definitely visit again and we hope soon.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.69.6Exceptional - What previous guests thought, 596 reviews Exceptional · 596 reviewsFrom $318 per nightCasa Dona Edite Guesthouse DouroHotel in Vilarinho de CotasLocated in Vilarinho de Cotas, Casa Dona Edite Guesthouse Douro features a seasonal outdoor swimming pool, shared lounge, restaurant, and free WiFi throughout the property.
