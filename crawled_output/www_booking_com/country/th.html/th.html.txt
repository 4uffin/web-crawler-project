Wonderful

The StandardX, Bangkok Phra Arthit has an outdoor swimming pool, garden, a terrace and restaurant in Bangkok. This 4-star hotel offers room service, a 24-hour front desk and free WiFi.
Very comfortable location due to the boat stop in front of the hotel. After a nice coffee and breakfast on the river facing terrace, it is easy to hop on to a boat and explore the city. The hotel entrance is very spacious with clean industrial lines. The room is very comfortable, good size, perfect bed, clean. Nice rooftop pool especially during sunset. Davines products in the bathroom is a cool extra!
