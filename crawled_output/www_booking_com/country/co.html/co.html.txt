Guest reviewWe had a fantastic time at Monasterio del Viento! It exceeded our expectations, especially since this was our first time visiting Providencia, and we weren’t sure how the island had recovered from the 2020 hurricane. The hotel is beautifully decorated with great attention to detail, creating a tranquil and luxurious retreat.
Alvaro, Melie, and the two ladies who cooked were all amazing—so welcoming and attentive. We still think about the delicious ceviche we had for lunch!
We deeply appreciate all the effort put into making Monasterio del Viento such a luxurious and well-run option on Providencia—it truly shows. Herbert was incredibly easy to communicate with and arranged everything we needed seamlessly. The level of service was truly five-star, and we’ve already told many friends that if they ever visit Providencia, Monasterio del Viento is the only place to consider!Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.99.9Exceptional - What previous guests thought, 8 reviews Exceptional · 8 reviewsFrom $658 per nightEco Reserva ChurulejaHotel in PanguíEco Reserva Churuleja in Panguí has 3-star accommodations with a garden, a restaurant and a bar.

Guest reviewThis is a spectacular reserve where you feel tucked away in the forest. You will wake up to the calls of the Common Potoo outside your window, but be greeted by fresh coffee (picked and roasted on site) when you wander out your door. The property is beautiful, simple, comfortable, and incredibly thoughtfully designed.
If you are a birder, you MUST stay here. Fernando will guide you expertly through the forest and tailor his guidance to your experience level. One of our favorite places we’ve ever birded.
And the food was absolutely delicious.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.89.8Exceptional - What previous guests thought, 7 reviews Exceptional · 7 reviewsFrom $133 per nightSoñarte Reserva NaturalHotel in CórdobaLocated in Córdoba, 25 miles from National Coffee Park, Soñarte Reserva Natural has accommodations with a garden, free private parking, a shared lounge and a terrace.
