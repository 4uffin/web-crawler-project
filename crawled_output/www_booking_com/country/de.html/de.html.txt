Hotel in Friedrichshain, Berlin
9.0
Wonderful
2,772 reviews
Located in Berlin, 1.8 miles from Alexanderplatz Metro Station, sly Berlin provides accommodations with a fitness center, private parking, a restaurant and a bar.
I loved this hotel! It was super cute, but well sized for a european hotel. The breakfast was delicious and substantial. The bar was convenient and well stocked. Check in and out was easy, especially with the no check out needed portion. It was a bit outside of the city center, but it was within walking distance of two street cars, so transit was really easy.
Edited to mention: I forgot to mention the bathroom! It was amazing! Huge, even! I loved it so much, I am using it as a model to renovate my own bathroom at home!!!
