Guest reviewBeautiful small hotel in a gorgeous part of Passau. Attentive staff, clean and comfortable. The breakfast selection looked lovely although we didn’t partake. Our room had a gorgeous view over the River and there was a small elevator to take your luggage up.

As soon as I entered, I was greeted like a family member and immediately felt comfortable and well cared for. The room was clean and cozy.

Guest reviewThe castle stay was beautifully decorated and very warm and cozy with character taking the visitor to the 15th century on the Rhine.
The breakfast was an array of variety choice foods including an omelet, very good tea choices and hot chocolate.
The library was warm with lots of books and a large fireplace to cozy up to in the cold winter months being close to Christmas by 2 days.
The room I stayed in was the attic with private balcony and elevator to get to that floor was exceptional since the winding stairs were narrow and steep.
The bed was a queen and felt larger than that and was very comfortable with 4 down pillows accented with Mozart chocolates from Salzburg Austria.
It had the pop out windows that overlook the Rhine river and was quite spacious for the stay.
I arrived by train and I highly suggest using a taxi it took 9 € to get me to the top of the winding steep mountain and then call the hotel castle to reserve a golf cart to take you and your luggage by porter to your room.
For me it worked out great since they had my room ready to check in at 11 am.
I arrived in the room with luggage already there in the room by the porter.
There is a nice watchtower museum that is included.
I did that the last day after breakfast.
It was a delightful stay and recommend this for anyone who likes adventure and history.
It was well worth the $335 a night.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.69.6Exceptional - What previous guests thought, 648 reviews Exceptional · 648 reviewsFrom $368 per nightSuit' & Frühstück Zum Latschen - Adults OnlyHotel in MauthSuit' & Frühstück Zum Latschen is an adult-only accommodations located in Mauth, in the heart of the Bavarian Forest.
