Wonderful
1,066 reviews
Located in Hamburg and with Hamburg Central Station reachable within 7.8 miles, Clounys Hotel has concierge services, non-smoking rooms, a terrace, free WiFi and a restaurant.
Everything! The staff were super friendly and helpful from check-in to check-out. Our room was perfectly laid out and clean and perfectly appointed. Loved the windows to the street. It was warm and cozy when we wanted and nice and cool when we needed it to be. One of the best rooms Iâ€™ve ever slept in. The bed was amazing! Live the location as it wasnâ€™t in the hustle and bustle of downtown. The train station is right outside the front door so not is easy to get anywhere you want. No parking lot but there is street side parking all over the place. If we return to Hamburg, we will be staying at Clouneys!

Wonderful
1,115 reviews
Located in Amberg and with Stadttheater Amberg reachable within a 6-minute walk, Mariandl am Berg has a tour desk, allergy-free rooms, a terrace, free WiFi throughout the property and a bar.
Staying at this hotel was a delight from start to finish. The rooftop bar, doubling as a breakfast spot, treated me to stunning views and a wonderful atmosphere. Positioned right in the heart of the city, mere moments from the train station, its location couldn't have been more convenient. The staff were not only friendly but incredibly accommodating; they swiftly arranged a room change when I mentioned my requirement for a workspace. Moreover, breakfast was a highlight in itself, with options like an industrial juicer for crafting your own smoothies. Overall, my experience was nothing short of excellent, thanks to the attentive staff and unbeatable location.
