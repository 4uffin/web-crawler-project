Guest reviewA beautifully presented family-run B & B that gives you all the privacy you want or engagement with other travelers in the well-appointed common areas.
Funnily enough, they get quite a few bookings and then cancellations from Australian travelers who mistakenly think they were booking for Torquay, Victoria, Australia rather than on the Devon Coast, UK.
The family is delightful with dad being an excellent chef (breakfast eggs benedict was cooked perfectly), mum was so hospitable with great directions and suggestions with our walk to the harbor front and dinner, and the daughter who looked after us with checking in and at breakfast was just a breath of fresh air (good luck with your uni studies).
I would definitely stay there again but this time for a few more days so we could take advantage of that inviting-looking swimming pool.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.79.7Exceptional - What previous guests thought, 377 reviews Exceptional · 377 reviewsFrom $178 per nightThe View at the White Horse Woolley MoorHotel in Clay CrossOffering a restaurant and a bar, The View at the White Horse Woolley Moor also features free WiFi access and free on-site parking for all guests.
