Guest reviewEverything. I really have no words to describe the perfection of the Old Stables room (loft? Mini-apartment?) I would happily live there forever. The room was huge, beautifully decorated in a fabulous equestrian motif (the Farrier is at the original blacksmith shop), sparkling clean, and too many amenities to list. The food is delicious and plentiful. We had the full English breakfast and it set us up for the whole day! Everyone on staff were really lovely and so kind. I wish we could’ve stayed for more than one night!Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.69.6Exceptional - What previous guests thought, 384 reviews Exceptional · 384 reviewsFrom $259 per nightHive TownhouseHotel in AberaeronLocated in Aberaeron, Hive Townhouse has a fitness center, restaurant, bar, and free WiFi throughout the property.

Guest reviewOur favourite stay in Scotland!
The rooms were not just beautifully appointed but also very thoughtfully. Service was attentive and warm but discreet. Great location to explore the area including a short drive to St. Andrews. From welcome drinks & treats in the stunning room with lovely views plus excellent lighting (a rarity in any hotel) to the extravagant breakfasts; a lot of effort had gone into making this an exceptional stay for their guests.
The breakfasts were an absolute treat, all perfectly cooked by their Chef with 5 star service by amazing Alex. Both managers David & Dave were lovely; nothing was too much trouble - including bringing ice up 3 flights of stairs for our drinks.
We enjoyed a lively & entertaining village jam session in the back bar on our first night; and it was still quiet in the bedroom during the session - great soundproofing!
Top marks for The Shoregate. Highly recommend.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.79.7Exceptional - What previous guests thought, 82 reviews Exceptional · 82 reviewsFrom $300 per nightThe Black Bull HotelHotel in DunsLocated in Duns and with The Maltings Theatre & Cinema reachable within 15 miles, The Black Bull Hotel provides a terrace, allergy-free rooms, free WiFi throughout the property and a bar.
