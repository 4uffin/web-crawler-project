In the lead-up to Call of Duty: Black Ops 7's release this November (and multiplayer beta starting in October), Activision has released a new video in which developers from Treyarch shared key new insights into what to expect from the multiplayer mode.Senior producer Brittany Pirello and design director Matt Scronce discussed a range of topics in the video, including whether or not Black Ops 7 will have manual doors, plans for post-launch content, and plenty more. Scroll through the gallery to find out more about what the developers said.Black Ops 7 launches on November 14, but the multiplayer beta starts in early October, so it won't be too much longer until people can try the game for themselves. Black Ops 7 will be available at launch on Game Pass, and it arrives about a month after Battlefield 6 debuts on October 10.Share this GalleryLatest Image GalleriesThe Best PlayStation Fighting Games For PS5 And PS4Xbox Game Pass Will See Four More Games Leave Soon, Including Ninja Gaiden: Master CollectionXbox Game Pass Expands With 13 More Games In SeptemberMap pacing Players can expect "a little bit of a change in pace" for Black Ops 7 multiplayer, Scronce said, referencing how the game might not necessarily feel as "sweaty" as Black Ops 6. Tactical sprint is gone in Black Ops 7 as a default ability, but players can use a perk for it if they want to zip around maps with speed like they could in Black Ops 6. Black Ops 7's speed isn't going to be sluggish, though, as there is a base increase to everyone's speed by default. Pirello said the aim was to give players a "chance to catch their breath" before they entered their next combat engagement. Three-lane maps "We got you," Pirello said in response to a call for more three-lane maps. All maps were designed with three lanes in mind, Pirello said, noting, however, that the developer opted to break those rules in some scenarios in the pursuit of fun. "We're really focusing on path clarity and getting back to the fundamentals of that Treyarch design style."More colorful maps Scronce said fans can expect more colorful maps in Black Ops 7 that harken back to maps from past games. A map like Homestead, for example, features the Aurora Borealis shining in the background, Scronce pointed out.Face Off and Gunfight The popular modes Face Off and Gunfight "never went away" in the first place Scronce said, and they will be in Black Ops 7. What is different this time around is that the Face Off and Gunfight maps are now designed to "serve more purposes" outside of those modes alone, he said.More medium-sized maps There will be more medium-sized 6v6 multiplayer maps at launch, Pirello said, with Scronce adding that a core piece of feedback from Black Ops 6 that the developers took on board was map size. To that end, Black Ops 7 will have fewer "tiny" maps and fewer "larger" maps.There will be four "small" maps at launch, and one of them, Blackheart, will be available to try in the beta.More Black Ops 2 remaster maps Black Ops 7 is something of a sequel to Black Ops 2, and with that in mind, Treyarch will add more Black Ops 2 remaster maps, Scronce teased. He declined to share any specifics, but said he's read what people said online and said people have guessed correctly. Hmm!Doors? In the latest Call of Duty games, multiplayer maps featured doors that could be opened and closed manually, but Treyarch is removing that entirely in Black Ops 7. "There are no manual doors," Scronce said. The game does have some maps that have automatic doors, however."At the start of development, our goal was to drastically reduce the number of manual doors we had in our maps," Scronce said. "About halfway through [development], we did a door count, and I think we had about six, so then we had a door meeting--behind closed doors--and then I kicked the door down and said, 'Let's delete all of these doors.' So, no manual doors in Black Ops 7 multiplayer."Post-launch DLC New multiplayer maps are coming after launch, the developer confirmed, stating the obvious. Beyond maps, Scronce said there will be a "ton" of new content added to the game over time through its seasonal model. He teased that a post-launch map coming not too long after launch will be one that fans go "ballistic" for.
