EA Sports College Football 26 has received its first big price cut since launching in July. Multiple retailers, including Amazon, are offering a $20 discount for PS5 and Xbox Series X. If you game on PlayStation 5, you can get the discount and a free steelbook case exclusively at Walmart. These deals drop the price of the great football sim to $50.

EA Sports College Football 26 + Steelbook Case (PS5)
$50 (was $70)
This Walmart-exclusive edition comes with a steelbook case in addition to the standard edition case, which is great news for Buckeyes and Crimson Tide fans since their star receivers are on the cover this year: Ohio State wide receiver Jeremiah Smith and Alabama receiver Ryan Williams.The background of the standard edition cover art is wrapped around the steelbook case. The collage of team logos features many of the biggest programs in the country, including the reigning national champ Buckeyes of The Ohio State University. The front of the case also features Notre Dame, Nebraska, Penn State, Clemson, Florida, and more schools. The back of the case has Alabama, Texas, Oregon, and a few other schools.Xbox users also get a free steelbook at Walmart, but Walmart isn't offering a discount for the Xbox Series X version.

EA Sports College Football 26 Standard Edition (PS5, Xbox)
$50 (was $70)
The standard edition without the steelbook case is discounted to the same price for PS5 and Xbox Series X at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target.EA Sports College Football 26 earned an 8/10 in our review thanks to improved presentation, welcome adjustments to Dynasty mode, and expanded playbooks. Issues from last year's edition, including baffling player transfer decisions and inconsistencies with team rankings and individual awards, are still present, but overall College Football 26 offers a better experience.As mentioned, you can bundle EA Sports College Football 26 with Madden NFL 26 for either console platform for $100 at Best Buy, which is a savings of $40 overall. Madden NFL 26 has yet to receive a discount on its own, but Best Buy's deal gets you both EA Sports sims for $50 each.
