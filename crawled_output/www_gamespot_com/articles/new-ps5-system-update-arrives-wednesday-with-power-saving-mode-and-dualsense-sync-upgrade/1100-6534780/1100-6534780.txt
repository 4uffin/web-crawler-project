A new PlayStation 5 system update is now available as of September 17, bringing the ability to pair a DualSense to multiple devices at once. The update also introduces a Power Saver mode to the PS5, which future updates to games like Death Stranding 2, Demon’s Souls, and Ghost of Yōtei will add support for. You can check out the complete patch notes for the update below.To update your console, you'll need to go to Settings. Then select System, System Software, and finally System Software Update and Settings. You can verify you're on the correct version by going into the Console Information section of the System settings menu and looking to see that your version starts with 25.06-12.00.00.Sony teased this PS5 update back in July, elaborating on how to sync the DualSense to multiple devices and sharing plans for the console's Power Saver mode. Once the update is installed, you can also update your DualSense controllers to let them sync with a maximum of four devices. Essentially, you assign each device to one of the four face buttons (triangle, circle, etc) when you pair it via Bluetooth, and can hot swap between them by pressing the PS button and the relevant action button simultaneously.With Power Saver on, the PS5 will scale back performance on some compatible games, lowering its power usage. VR mode won't work with Power Saver on and some gameplay features may also be affected.You can activate Power Saver via Settings, System, Power Saving, and selecting the Use Power Saver option.PS5 Version 25.06-12.00.00 update patch notesYou can now turn on power saver for supported PS5 games. When using power saver, you can scale back performance as needed to reduce power consumption.
You can adjust this in Settings > System > Power Saving > Use Power Saver. You can turn this on or off for each supported game.When power saver is on, and a game supporting power saver is active, an icon appears next to the game in Switcher in the control center.We've updated the device software for the DualSense wireless controller and the DualSense Edge wireless controller.
It's now possible to pair your controller with multiple devices. You can register up to 4 devices and switch the device you're connected to using your controller.
