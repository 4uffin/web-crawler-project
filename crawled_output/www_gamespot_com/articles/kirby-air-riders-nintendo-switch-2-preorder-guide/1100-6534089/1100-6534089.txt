Kirby Air Riders launches November 20 exclusively on Nintendo Switch 2.

And if you buy both Kirby Air Riders Amiibo sets, you can place Kirby on Waddle's Winged Star and vice-versa to unlock different character and machine builds.

Kirby Air Riders' $70 price point matches other recent and upcoming Switch 2 titles, including Donkey Kong Bananza and Pokemon Legends: Z-A, which is scheduled to launch in October. Outside of Mario Kart World, the only $80 Switch 2 games so far are updated versions of original Switch exclusives with new content. Notably, this includes Kirby and the Forgotten Land + Star-Crossed World, the Switch 2-exclusive version of the superb 3D platformer. Along with overhauled graphics, the Switch 2 Edition has the new Star-Crossed World story campaign. You're essentially paying for the $60 base game and the new $20 DLC as a bundle, so the comparison to Kirby Air Riders isn't exactly 1:1.Kirby games for Nintendo Switch 1/2Kirby and the Forgotten LandIf you're looking forward to Kirby Air Riders and want to spend some time with the series before its November release, there are plenty of options on Nintendo Switch. In addition to Forgotten Land--the first 3D platformer for the franchise--there are two traditional side-scrolling-platformers with physical editions: Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe and Kirby Star Allies. Kirby has also starred in multiple digital-only Switch games and numerous classic titles are on Nintendo Switch Online. One of the best Kirby spin-offs in recent years is Kirby's Dream Buffet ($15), which also happened to inspire a couple of the cutest Club Mocchi-Mocchi Kirby plushies around.If you're interested in the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition of Forgotten Land, existing owners can buy the DLC and upgrade for $20. Newcomers can also save $15 by picking up the Switch edition and Star-Crossed World separately. Multiple of the best Kirby game deals right now are for UK editions at Amazon-owned retailer Woot. Switch consoles can play games from any region, so the only difference with these Kirby games is the ratings board logo on the cover is PEGI instead of ESRB.Kirby Game DealsKirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe -- $49 ($60)
