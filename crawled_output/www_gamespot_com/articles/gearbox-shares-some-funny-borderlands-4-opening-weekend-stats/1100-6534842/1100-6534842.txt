Borderlands 4 arrived last week, and planet Kairos is ripe for the looting. Gearbox Studios has released a handful of stats from Borderlands 4 that reveal just how far some players are willing to go to find loot.A few stats from Borderlands 4's opening weekend, courtesy of Gearbox Studios.According to the graph, 1,530,794 items were looted from an outhouse. Who knew there was so much treasure to be found there?! By comparison, only 487,585 items were looted from trashcans, which apparently means there's more to be gained from going into an outhouse than digging through a normal trash receptacle. Players also looted 1,811,970 items from boomboxes, beer coolers, and grills. However, red chests comfortably took the top slot with 14,814,296 items looted in the first weekend.Getting all of that treasure didn't happen without a price; 2,034,399 players suffered an unfortunate end by barrel. Grenade fatalities were even higher with 4,563,416. Although deaths by toxic goo were much smaller with 349,734, those are the ones that looked like they hurt the most.Among the game's vehicles, exactly 16,220,852 were destroyed, although the stat doesn't break it down by vehicle. Players attempted 62,718,658 boss battles, and 55,403,323 bosses fell in defeat. However, there were 16,220,852 failed boss encounters that left the players on the losing end.Additionally, Gearbox shared a code for the Break Free Pack and two ECHO-4 drone skins: JS63J-JSCWJ-CFTBW-3TJ3J-WJS5R.Vault Hunters! You unleashed SO MUCH mayhem during Borderlands 4's launch weekend. You get the Break Free Pack PLUS two ECHO-4 Drone Skins! JS63J-JSCWJ-CFTBW-3TJ3J-WJS5RNow go forth & keep on showing us your unyielding badassery! https://t.co/rIZz2Y6Olm pic.twitter.com/RPmAhEOJqe

Although Borderlands 4 had primarily positive critical reviews, PC players have been very vocal on Steam about performance and optimization issues. Gearbox Studios CEO Randy Pitchford has disputed players' accounts and remained defiant about the issue while also offering optimization tips. Pitchford also noted that a PS5 Pro patch is in the works to combat issues on that console.Borderlands 4 is out now for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC. The Switch 2 port will be released on October 3.
