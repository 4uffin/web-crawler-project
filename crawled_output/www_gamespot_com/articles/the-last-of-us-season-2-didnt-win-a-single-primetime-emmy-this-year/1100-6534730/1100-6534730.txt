Last night's Primetime Emmy Awards show was a celebration of the best that TV had to offer, and while numerous shows were recognized for their excellence, The Last of Us wasn't one of them. The second season of the HBO Max series was nominated for several awards--Best Drama Series, Best Actor in a drama series, and Best Actress in a drama series--and while it did win the award for Outstanding Sound Editing for a one-hour comedy or drama series at the non-televised Creative Arts Emmys last week, it was overshadowed during the Primetime awards ceremony.The Last of Us was the first live-action video game adaptation to be nominated for several Primetime Emmy Awards, winning eight Emmys out of its 24 nominations, including Outstanding Guest Actor for Nick Offerman. This year, The Last of Us walked away empty-handed, as The Studio scooped four awards, The Pitt won three Emmys, and two months after its cancellation, The Late Show with Stephen Colbert won best talk series. The Penguin's Cristin Milloti won best actress in a limited or anthology series or movie, and Dan Gilroy took home the Emmy for best writing in a drama series for his work on Star Wars: Andor.The second season of The Last of Us wasn't nominated for any writing or directing episodes, but Naughty Dog co-president Neil Druckmann still praised the cast and crew of the series after the nominations were first revealed. The confirmed third season of The Last of Us is also in development, and it'll focus on Abby when it eventually arrives.
