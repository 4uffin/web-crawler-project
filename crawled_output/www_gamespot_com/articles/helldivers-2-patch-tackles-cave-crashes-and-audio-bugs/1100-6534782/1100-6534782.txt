Helldivers 2's galactic war is playing out with PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X|S players united behind a common cause. And while the battle continues, so too does the struggle to address the bugs that have come up in the game. Arrowhead Game Studios has released a new patch for Helldivers 2, but there aren't many Super Earth-shattering issues this week.The details for Helldivers 2 patch 01.400.002 have been shared on Steam and Discord, and most of the bugs are either crash or audio-related issues. Perhaps the most amusing bug placed Helldivers on top of cave structures while reinforcing. There are two Xbox-specific fixes, including the restoration of SDR colors to their proper brightness level and a bug that prevented players from accessing Helldivers user profiles.Earlier this month, Helldivers 2 unleashed the Into the Unjust update, which added a lot of new content. If you're having trouble fighting the Hive Lords, we recommend using nukes and lots of them. They're pretty hard to kill if you're coming at them with anything less powerful. Helldivers 2 has also surged past 500,000 concurrent players, which may mean that the influx of players from Xbox Series X|S is increasing engagement across the board.Arrowhead CEO Shams Jorjani has said said that the majority of Helldivers 2 players enjoy the game "silently" and don't offer much feedback that the developers can use. However, the team has been releasing large patches and smaller updates to keep the game running as smoothly as possible.The complete notes for Helldivers 2 patch 01.400.002 are below.FixesFixed a crash on cave maps, when host migrates under certain conditionsFixed a crash to desktop which would occur if the oil rig was destroyed when the shuttle was on its wayFixed a crash when joining someone who is using bombardment stratagemsFixed a crash on game start-upFixed an issue where Helldivers were reinforcing on top of cave structuresThe Dragonroach can now be damaged with fire and/or gasRupture Warriors now track moving clients accurately, leveling the difficulty level of attacks between client and hostFixed an audio bug related to Devastator projectilesRebalanced caves audio levelsFixed a rare instance where Primary Weapon audio would go missing(Xbox specific) SDR colors no longer appear faded(Xbox specific) Fixed a bug where users could not access a Helldivers User Profile in several screensKnown IssuesNewExtraction shuttle or beacon may clip into terrain, preventing extraction.The Nuke Nursey Drill can be dropped on top of the cave by the ship becoming inaccessibleTechnicalKeybinds do not save after restarting the game using the AZERTY and French keyboard settingsPlayers who are using the Microsoft IME languages are unable to type Korean, Japanese and Chinese symbols in chat.GameplaySome weapons may be missing sound effects for some players.Explosives can cause Helldivers hidden behind terrain to ragdollWeapon scopes may have an incorrect FOV that doesn't match the weaponInterrupting the reload animation of the StA-11 SMG may result in the magazine being consumed without reloading it.The right gauntlet of SR-64 Cinderblock armor is misalignedCapes don't display in the Armory tab and instead show a blank grey capeWeapon customization doesn't correctly display stats for sway and reload times'Leviathan' and 'Warrior' change to 'Advocate' when used in Super Destroyer namesXP modifier is not applied accurately for high CR Eradicate and Blitz missions.Extraction Shuttle can sometimes clip into the ground while landing
