The co-op game follows two young writers, Mio Hudson (Kaja Chan) and Zoe Foster (Elsie Bennett), who find themselves trapped in a simulation of their stories. Mio and Zoe are forced to work together as their fictional worlds bleed into each other. Split Fiction was the follow up to Hazelight Studios' other successful co-op title, It Takes Two, which sold 23 million copies.There's already a Split Fiction movie in development, with Wicked director John M. Chu potentially helming the film. Sydney Sweeney is also attached to star in the project. Deadpool writers Paul Wernick and Rhett Reese signed on to handle the script in June. Fares has expressed some doubt about whether Split Fiction will actually make it to the big screen, but it does appear to have momentum behind it.Split Fiction is available on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch 2, and PC.All Split Fiction Easter Eggs You Might've Missed: Elden Ring, Halo, And MoreSee More
