Fans of Hot Wheels, building sets, and cars in general should check out the recently released replica vehicle models while they are in stock. The new Hot Wheels building sets launched August 1 as the first members of the toy manufacturer's Brick Shop brand. Similar to Lego and Mega Bloks--which is owned by Mattel--Hot Wheels Brick Shop building sets are pieced together using a variety of different brick types and sizes. Whereas Mega Bloks' Hot Wheels sets are more playful and geared toward younger audiences, Mattel's Brick Shop kits were designed for collectors and car enthusiasts who are looking for authentic models of iconic cars such as the Mercedes-Benz 300 SL, Corvette Grand Sport, Cadillac Project GTP Hypercar, and Maserati MC20. Each Brick Shop model is built with pieces that are compatible with other major brands such as Lego and Mega Bloks.

Each build comes with customizable parts, interactive features, and a 1:64 scale diecast Hot Wheels car. Preorders initially opened back in May and promptly sold out. At this time, the first four building sets in the list below are in stock at Amazon and Walmart. The last three sets are only sold at select retailers and are currently out of stock. Amazon has a deal on the largest set in the lineup: The 1,600-piece Mercedes-Benz 300 SL is up for grabs for $115.31 (was $130).

The Speed Series ($20) is the entry-level tier with builds of roughly 250-300 pieces each. These budget-friendly kits will let you create a customizable, 1:32 scale replica of a sport/race car. The Elite Series ($54) is more authentic and customizable, thanks to the inclusion of metal components and significantly higher piece counts for these 1:16 scale models. The Premium Series ($130) currently only has the Mercedes-Benz, but it has nearly double the number of pieces as the Elite Series builds and produces a 1:12 scale model.
