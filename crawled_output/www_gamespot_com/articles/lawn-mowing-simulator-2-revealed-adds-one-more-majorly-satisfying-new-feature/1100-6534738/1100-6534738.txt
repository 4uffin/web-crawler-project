The era of "simulator" games continues, as Skyhook Games has announced Lawn Mowing Simulator 2--and there is a key change to be aware of right away.Self-publishingAfter Skyhook worked with Curve Games on the successful original game, Skyhook and Curve have parted ways for the sequel. Skyhook will self-publish Lawn Mowing Simulator 2, which means the developer itself takes all the risk--"which is scary"--but also gets "complete ownership of the project and control over the direction we take.""We're sure that many of you will have a sense that the video games industry is in a tough spot right now, and you're not wrong. There are a lot of games being cancelled and jobs being lost--and in some ways that makes our decision to self-publish even more terrifying," the developer said.Skyhook said it has "enough funding" to make Lawn Mowing Simulator 2 thanks to the success of the original game, but the company is also launching a Kickstarter campaign to raise money to help improve and expand existing plans.What's new in Lawn Mowing Simulator 2?Lawn Mowing Simulator 2 aims to offer an "expanded take on professional lawn care," featuring a new setting in the USA, more mowers and string trimmers to choose from, "new grass tech," a "total overhaul" for the career mode, and one of the most-requested features overall: leaf blowers."We know these have been wanted for a long time, and in LMS2 we plan to have leaf blowers as a part of the core game for clearing up leaves, as well as grass clippings," Skyhook said. "But leaf blowers wouldn't be much fun without a lot of leaves to blast! So in LMS2 we plan on having a system where tens of thousands of leaves can be blown around at once."The new grass in Lawn Mowing Simulator 2.Lawn Mowing Simulator 2 is in development for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. There is no release date. For more, you can visit the Lawn Mowing Simulator 2 Kickstarter page--the campaign goes live soon.These kind of simulator games are very popular, in part because of how chill and zen they are. 2021's Lawn Mowing Simulator had more viewers on Twitch than Call of Duty: Warzone for a period of time.The Best Simulation Games To Play in 2025See More
