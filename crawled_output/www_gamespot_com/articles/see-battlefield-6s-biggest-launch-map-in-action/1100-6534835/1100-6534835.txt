One of the complaints from the Battlefield 6 multiplayer beta was that the maps were too small, but the game does indeed have larger maps--and now you can see two of them in action.Mirak Valley is Battlefield 6's biggest launch map, and it certainly looks massive. Set in Tajikistan, Mirak Valley features massive open spaces, along with more close-quarter environments. Being a huge map, Mirak Valley also has a variety of vehicles players can zip around on and fight with.

Also on display in the video above is Battlefield 6's brand-new mode, Escalation. A spin on Conquest, Escalation has players capturing zones to fill a meter, and once it's full, a team earns one point--the meter then resets. The goal is earn three points to win a match. The twist is that when a team earns a point, some of the objectives on the map are eliminated, meaning the capture points teams are fighting over get smaller and smaller, thereby ... escalating the action.Another large-scale map is Operation Firestorm, and it's a new version of the fan-favorite map of the same name from Battlefield 3. It's set in an oil field and you can see it in action in the video below.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.
