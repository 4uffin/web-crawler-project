Battlefield 6 has largely been well-received during its beta test, but some players have been very adamant that the game should avoid the "Fortnitification" that the Call of Duty franchise has embraced. Battlefield Studios head Vince Zampella has previously said that Battlefield 6 will "stay true to Battlefield." However, a leaked Battlefield 6 skin has some players eager to send EA a message that they won't welcome similar outfits in the game.Even if you don't think this looks too flashy or over the top, the community needs to push back against skins like these. EA with push cosmetics as far as we let them and we shouldn't wait 'til they try adding Santa before they are deterred by community backlash. byu/SpiritualBacon inBattlefield
The lime green on black look isn't nearly as cartoonish as the Beavis and Butt-Head or American Dad skins in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. But assuming it's real, it does seem to veer away from the realistic military skins that some Battlefield fans prefer. The poster, SpirtualBacon, suggested that fans should voice their opinions about that now before EA doubles down on something even more outlandish.This is a concern that's come up among Battlefield players before, but any movement to keep the game crossover free may not get much traction because selling CoD skins has proven to be very lucrative for Activision. EA has never been the kind of company to leave potential revenue on the table, although there aren't currently any announced plans for Battlefield 6 crossovers or collaborations.On September 26, EA will reveal the details about Battlefield 6's story mode. The game's battle royale mode was unveiled earlier this month. Battlefield 6 will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on October 10.How To Get All Free Battlefield 6 Skins And Rewards In Battlefield 2042See More
