Rematch Elite Edition
$40 | Releases November 14
Preorder at Amazon
EA Sports FC 26 might be the most popular soccer (er, football) game on the horizon, but it's not the only one you can look forward to later this year. After launching digitally earlier this year, the 5v5 online multiplayer soccer game Rematch is getting a physical Elite Edition release on November 14 for PS5, Xbox Series X, and PC. Developed by Slocap, the same studio responsible for Sifu and Absolver, Rematch takes a truly unique approach to the sport, and it's proven to be popular with fans seeking a fun alternative to the EA Sports FC series. Preorders for the PS5 physical Rematch Elite Edition are now available for $40 at Amazon; Xbox and PC physical edition preorders should also be available soon. While there are currently no preorder bonuses, it does come loaded with additional in-game content, which we've detailed below.

Rematch Elite EditionRematch is also available now in multiple digital versions for PS5, Xbox, and PC via Steam, including a $30 standard edition, $40 Rematch Pro Edition, and a digital version of the Elite Edition for $40. That means that the new physical Elite Edition is $10 than the digital version and includes the same content. However, PC players can snag a discount on all three versions if they grab the game through Fanatical. With Fanatical's discounts, the PC standard edition is just $25.79 (was $30), the Pro Edition is $34.39 (was $40), and the Elite Edition is $43 (was $50). Games purchased from Fanatical are delivered as official Steam keys.Rematch Deals at Fanatical (Steam)Rematch standard edition -- $27.79 ($30)Rematch Pro Edition -- $34.39 ($40)Rematch Elite Edition -- $43 ($50)Rematch Elite Edition's fast-paced and arcade-style gameplay differs from other soccer video games, such as EA Sports FC. Only five players field the pitch per team, and there are no fouls, offsides, or out of bounds. In fact, each pitch is enclosed in invisible walls that players can bounce the ball off of, making for a totally unique take on the popular sport. Our Rematch review gave Rematch a 7/10, highlighting its unique skill-based gameplay, satisfying shooting mechanics, and the need for teamwork to win a match. "It's a different kind of football game, yet it's intuitive, and the allure of improving your skill level is captivating," wrote critic Richard Wakeling.If you're looking for more arcade sports games like Rematch, the fast-paced basketball video game NBA Bounce launches on consoles and PC on September 26. This cooperative 4v4 basketball game is designed for players of all ages, and lets you create custom players for your favorite NBA team or even play as each team's mascot. Physical edition preorders are available for $40 on Nintendo Switch, PS5, PS4, and Xbox Series X. While the in-game content seems to be the same across all versions, physical Switch copies include an exclusive bonus sticker sheet.Similarly, Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds arrives on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch, and PC a day earlier on September 25, and preordering at Amazon gets you a free poster. You can also reserve a copy of the recently announced Mario Tennis Fever ahead of its February 12, 2026 release on Switch 2. The new entry in the long-running Mario Tennis series introduces a bunch of new single-player content, mini-game challenges, and the biggest Mario Tennis roster yet, with 38 playable characters.As mentioned above, EA Sports FC 26 is also launching soon on September 26. The newest entry in EA's annual soccer video game franchise is available to preorder on PS5, PS4, Xbox, Nintendo Switch 2, Switch, and PC, and grabbing an early copy gets you a bunch of in-game bonus items, XP boosts, and more. There's also a $100 digital-only Ultimate Edition that includes even more extras and lets you start playing a week early on September 19.While EA Sports FC 26 is a good choice for anyone looking to play a more authentic adaptation of soccer--especially since it lets you play as real-world teams and players--if you're looking for a deep soccer club management simulator, the aptly titled Football Manager 26 is launching first on PC on November 4 and preorders are discounted to $49.19 (was $60) at Fanatical. The game will also launch on PS5, Nintendo Switch, Xbox, and Game Pass at a later date, though preorders for the console versions are not yet available.More Sports Game PreordersEA Sports FC 26 (standard) -- $70 | Releases September 26EA Sports FC 26 Ultimate Edition -- $100 | Releases September 19Football Manager 26 (PC) -- $49.19 ($60) | Releases November 24Mario Tennis Fever -- $70 | Releases February 12NBA Bounce -- $50 | Releases September 26Rematch Elite Edition -- $40 | Releases November 14Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds -- $70 | Releases September 25Disclosure: GameSpot and Fanatical are both owned by Fandom.Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter: More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals & Preorders
