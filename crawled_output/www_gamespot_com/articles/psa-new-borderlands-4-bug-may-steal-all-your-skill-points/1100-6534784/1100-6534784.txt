Borderlands 4 is now out, and amidst several issues that players have reported, it looks like there's a bug that could cause you to lose all of your skill points. So what's causing this glitch to trigger? Gearbox says that disconnecting and rejoining a multiplayer session or a game crash in single-player could be the problem here, and it says that it has noted here. There is currently no way to restore those lost skill points, and there's no indicator yet of when a fix for this bug will be released."Players may lose skill points after disconnecting and re-joining a multiplayer session, or crashing in single player. In these instances, they have lost all or most of their skill points. Leveling up more and using the Respec machine do not restore the lost skill points," Gearbox wrote on its support page.

Now Playing: Borderlands 4 Video Review
Some players have unfortunately encountered this bug, causing them to lose hours of progress. While the game is still playable, doing so without any skill points invested in your Vault Hunter makes it much more challenging, given that the game features level-scaling in its world. Skills help to even the playing field and can unlock powerful skills to help you survive longer in a fight, and Borderlands 4 places a bigger emphasis on building a powerful Vault Hunter with these abilities and the right gear.This is just one of several issues plaguing Borderlands 4 players currently, leading to the game being slammed with negative reviews on Steam. Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford has responded to the complaints through his X social media account, but his replies have not been well-received by the Borderlands fandom.Gearbox has been monitoring issues with the PC build of the game and has posted several suggestions for players experiencing issues while it works on addressing problems in Borderlands 4. If you're still planning to play, you can check out our Borderlands 4 guides hub for several helpful features, tips, and tricks.Every Borderlands Game, ReviewedSee More
