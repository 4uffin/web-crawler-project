Super Mario Bros. Wonder is receiving a Nintendo Switch 2 edition, one that will include a new suite of multiplayer modes called Meetup in Bellabel Park.Bellabel Park is a large plaza filled with various minigames where players can team up or compete against one another. On the competitive side, there is a coin-collecting game, a Smash Bros.-esque platformer battle game where players use items to push others off the level, a version of hide-and-seek where players can transform into objects to hide, and more. For those who are looking for more of a co-op experience, Nintendo showed a Bob-omb Relay mode where players must work together to ferry a Bob-omb across a level before it explodes, a mode where one player places blocks that another uses to traverse gaps, and one where a group of players must time their jumps in order to raise a platform.The addition of Bellabel Park isn't the only new content coming to the Switch 2 version of Super Mario Bros. Wonder, Nintendo teased, but said fans will get to learn more about that "in the future." Super Mario Bros. Wonder + Meetup in Bellabel Park will launch in Spring 2026 for Switch 2.Alongside this, Nintendo is also releasing a physical talking flower based on those in the game.Nintendo announced the new version of the 2023 Mario game as part of its latest Nintendo Direct, which outlined all the various ways Nintendo is celebrating Mario's 40th Anniversary, including a Super Mario Galaxy movie and remasters of Super Mario Galaxy 1+2.Nintendo Direct September 2025: All The Biggest AnnouncementsSee More
