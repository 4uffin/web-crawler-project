The Nintendo Switch 2 has already seen some pretty cool accessories, but this upcoming Eevee lineup might be the most adorable yet. Hori is releasing four Eevee-inspired accessories--including a wired controller, two carrying cases, and a protective pouch that sotres up to 24 game cards--on October 3, which is just in time for the next big Pokemon game, Pokemon Legends: Z-A. All four devices in the lineup feature an adorable "Eevee Cottage Core" design design featuring cute illustrations of the Gen 1 Pokemon. They're also officially licensed by Nintendo and The Pokemon Company, and are compatible with both Switch 2 and Switch. So even if you haven't yet picked up the new-gen console, you can enjoy the adorable gadgets with your current Switch. Hori x Pokemon Eevee Switch 2 Accessories at Amazon
Horipad Turbo Wired Controller - Eevee Cottage Core Edition
$45 | Releases October 3
This new version of the Horipad Turbo Wired Controller is a charming Eevee-themed faceplate and light blue and brown color palette.
It features all the functionality of other Horipad Turbo controllers, incluing two remappable back buttons, a Turbo function that lets you rapidly activate a button simply by holding it down, and adjustable dead zones for the analog sticks. Since this is designed primarily for Switch 2, it includes the C Button to access GameChat.
While the wired format means you'll have to be plugged into one of the Switch 2 dock's USB ports, the upshot is that you won't have to worry about low battery levels.

The Hori Puff Pouch is a soft-sided carrying case. While it lacks the durability and protection of a hard-sided case, it's still a great option for a simple carrying case--and it's large enough to carry a Switch 2, Switch, or Switch OLED device in handheld mode, and includes an assortment of pouches to store an AC adapter and up to six game cartridges. Like the other accessories in the lineup, it features light blue and brown color scheme with illustrations of Eevee. Preorders are available for $37 at Amazon

Along with enough space to store the handheld, there are also 10 game cartridge slots and a mesh pouch for accessories like earbuds or a charging cable. The case also spots the same blue and brown color schemes and Eevee art. Preorders are available for $30 at Amazon.

These new Eevee-themed Switch and Switch 2 accessories arrive just in time for the next big Pokemon game, Pokemon Legends: Z-A, which launches for Switch and Switch 2 on October 16. Legends: Z-A will build upon the real-time catching mechanics of the previous game in the new spin-off series, Legends: Arceus, and will also feature an all-new real-time battle system that sees you avoiding enemies attacks while issuing commands to your Pokemon partners. Preorders for the Switch and Switch 2 Editions of the game are available now--though fans who are waiting to pick up a Switch 2 alongside the new game will want to check out the upcoming Switch 2 + Pokemon Legends: Z-A console bundle launching the same day. This $500 bundle includes a Switch 2 console and a digital copy of Pokemon Legends: Z-A, saving you $40 compared to buying the console and the game separately. You can learn more about the game and all the preorder options in our Pokemon Legends: Z-A preorder guide.Pokemon Legends Z-A Preorders
