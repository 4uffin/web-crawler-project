This week's hour-long Nintendo Direct was filled with exciting announcements, including brand-new reveals like Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2 and long-awaited release date confirmations such as Metroid Prime 4: Beyond. We now know that Nintendo has six big game launches in a two-month span starting with the Mario Galaxy collection on October 2 and ending with Metroid Prime 4 December 4. In between, we're getting Pokemon Legends: Z-A, Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment, and Kirby Air Riders--plus a wide assortment of third-party titles like timed-exclusive Hades II, which is published by Nintendo.Nintendo Direct Preorders:Preorder new Nintendo Games at AmazonPreorder new Nintendo Amiibo at AmazonNintendo also revealed seven new Amiibo figures: three for Metroid Prime 4, two for Kirby Air Riders, and two for Super Mario Galaxy. Metroid and Mario also have upcoming books releasing this fall: Metroid Prime 1-3: A Visual Retrospective and Rosalina's Storybook.We've rounded up all of the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 (and original Switch) games and accessories from the Nintendo Direct that you can preorder now at Amazon. This roundup also includes Nintendo-published games and first-party accessories for Switch 2 that are already available. If you don't own Nintendo's new console, Amazon opened preorders for the Switch 2 Pokemon Legends: Z-A Bundle on September 12. It's the first time you can simply buy the console from Amazon without an extra step. To purchase the Mario Kart World Bundle and standalone console from Amazon, you need to request an invite.

Nintendo Switch 2 Games at AmazonUpcoming Nintendo Switch 2 and Switch exclusivesAll Switch 2 Games at AmazonSee Nintendo Exclusives at AmazonSee upcoming games at AmazonMario Kart World's $80 price led many Nintendo fans to believe this would be a common price point for Switch 2 exclusives. It turns out that's not the case--at least not yet. Metroid Prime 4, Hyrule Warriors, Kirby Air Riders, and all of the other Switch 2 games in Nintendo's popular franchises are $70. Original Switch editions of Pokemon Legends: Z-A and Metroid Prime 4: Beyond are $60. The outlier here is Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2. The lone physical edition is an original Switch game that's priced at $70. The collection has a free upgrade pack for Switch 2.Note: A couple of the games in the list below aren't exclusive to Switch 1/2--Dragon Quest VII Reimagined and Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade--but they were part of the September Nintendo Direct. Hades II is a timed console exclusive published by Nintendo, but it will also be available on PC at launch.Nintendo Direct (September 2025) - Switch 1/2 Game PreordersSuper Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2 -- $70 | Oct. 2Pokemon Legends: Z-A -- $60-$70 | Oct. 16Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment -- $70 | Nov. 6Kirby Air Riders -- $70 | Nov. 20Hades II -- $50 | Nov. 20Metroid Prime 4: Beyond -- $60-$70 | Dec. 4Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade -- $40 | Jan. 22, 2026Dragon Quest VII Reimagined -- $60 | Feb. 5, 2026Mario Tennis Fever -- $70 | Feb. 12, 2026Nintendo Switch 2 Exclusives Available NowBravely Default: Flying Fairy HD Remaster -- $40Donkey Kong Bananza -- $69 ($70)Kirby and the Forgotten Land + Star-Crossed World -- $79 ($80)The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild -- $69 ($70)The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom -- $79 ($80)Mario Kart World -- $79 ($80)Super Mario Party Jamboree + Jamboree TV -- $79 ($80)Yakuza 0 Director's Cut -- $37 ($50)Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S -- $30 ($40)Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma -- $49-$60 ($60-$70)

The large Samus & Vi-O-La motorcycle figure is $40 and launches alongside the new $30 Samus Aran Amiibo on November 6. An Amiibo version of Sylux hits store shelves the same day as Metroid Prime 4: Beyond. The two Kirby Air Riders Amiibo are $50 each, which makes them the priciest Amiibo figures yet. It's not very surprising, though, as the Warp Star and and Winged Star Machines shown above are separate figures, so these are more like double packs. Super Mario Galaxy fans will have to wait until April 2026 to add the new Mario and Rosalina Amiibo figures to their collections. Each figure is $40, though the character stands are more elaborate than we typically see with Amiibo.Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Amiibo PreordersSamus & Vi-O-La -- $40 | Nov. 6Samus -- $30 | Nov. 6Sylux -- $30 | Dec. 4Kirby Air Riders Amiibo PreordersKirby & Warp Star -- $50 | Nov. 20Banana Waddle Dee & Winged Star -- $50 | Nov. 20Super Mario Galaxy Amiibo PreordersMario and Luma -- $40 | Apr. 2, 2026Rosalina and Lumas -- $40 | Apr. 2, 2026The seven new Amiibo join an existing lineup of eight Zelda, Street Fighter, and Donkey Kong Switch 2 Amiibo figures.
