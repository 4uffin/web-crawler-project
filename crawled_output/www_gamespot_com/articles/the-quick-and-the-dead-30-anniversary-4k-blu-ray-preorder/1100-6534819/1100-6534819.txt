This isn't the first time that The Quick and the Dead has appeared on 4K Blu-ray, but the steelbook cover for this anniversary edition is brand-new. Designed to look like a Wild West poster, the cover features the main cast in a sepia tone, with Sharon Stone and the late Gene Hackman posing for a showdown on the interior and the rear. The standard Blu-ray release of the movie didn't offer any bonus materials, but this new 4K version has a handful of extras.

The Quick and the Dead 30th Anniversary Steelbook Edition 4K Blu-rayThe Quick and the Dead 30th Anniversary Steelbook Edition 4K Blu-ray special featuresThis new The Quick and the Dead 30th Anniversary Steelbook Edition of the movie only includes a few special features, but that's still more than the film's previous Blu-ray releases. Here's what's included:Six deleted scenesOriginal theatrical trailerIf you've never seen it and you love cowboy movies, then The Quick and the Dead is highly recommended as it turns the genre on its head, and it still looks fantastic 30 years later. Released in 1995, The Quick and the Dead is often considered to be one of the best westerns of the '90s, even if it was overlooked back then. In addition to Stone and Hackman, the movie also starred a very young Leonardo DiCaprio, Russell Crowe, Keith David, and Lance Henriksen. Set in a violent town of Redemption, the movie follows the Lady (Stone) as she seeks to avenge the death of her father. Killed years earlier by John Herod--played to perfection by Hackman--Lady enters a dueling contest that has attracted several of the fastest gunmen in the west.Raimi's take on the western genre will be instantly recognizable to anyone who has seen his Evil Dead and Darkman films, as The Quick and the Dead is full of his signature camera angles, fast-paced action sequences, and slow-burn storytelling. The 4K remaster is especially good, as it offers a solid HDR-10 coloring, sharp image quality, and just enough grain to make various visual elements stand out, especially when compared to the softer standard Blu-ray release from the late 2000s.Raimi would go on to direct several more movies after The Quick and the Dead, including the iconic Spider-Man trilogy. The first live-action Spider-Man film raised the bar for superhero movies, and it was followed up with two sequels. If you're looking to revisit the series, the 4K Blu-ray collection is on sale for $43.69 (was $76), and it's a sharp UHD remaster of Spidey's battles against the Green Goblin, Doc Ock, the Sandman, and Venom.
