Pokemon fans have a limited-time chance to snag some legendary shiny Pokemon in Scarlet and Violet. Shiny versions of the four Treasures of Ruin--Wo-Chien, Chien-Pao, Ting-Lu, Chi-Yu--will appear in five-star Tera raids over the next few weeks. However, getting them will involve a bit of work. That said, starting today, a free Shiny Chien-Pao will join Wo-Chien as another freebie that you'll be highly unlikely to acquire in the future.Unlike previous raid events, the shiny Treasures of Ruin events work a little differently. This time around, you can't catch the shiny legendary Pokemon directly after beating them; each one will simply flee upon being defeated. However, if players can cumulatively defeat the Pokemon one million times before their events end, the shiny legendaries will be distributed as free Mystery Gifts.Three of the four shiny Treasures of Ruin are available to claim right now through September 30, with the final legendary, Chi-Yu, slated to join soon. You can take a look at the full event schedule and read more details on how to get the shiny legendary Pokemon below.Table of Contents [hide]Shiny Treasures Of Ruin Raid ScheduleShiny Wo-ChienShiny Chien-PaoShiny Ting-LuShiny Chi-YuHow To Join Tera RaidsHow To Claim Mystery GiftsDistribution PeriodsShiny Treasures Of Ruin Raid ScheduleShiny Wo-ChienStart date: July 22 at 5 PM PT / 8 PM ETEnd date: August 3 at 4:59 PM PT / 7:59 PM ETTera type: GrassShiny Chien-PaoStart date: August 3 at 5 PM PT / 8 PM ETEnd date: August 17 at 4:59 PM PT / 7:59 PM ETTera type: IceShiny Ting-LuStart date: August 17 at 5 PM PT / 8 PM ETEnd date: August 31 at 4:59 PM PT / 7:59 PM ETTera type: GroundShiny Chi-YuStart date: August 31 at 5 PM PT / 8 PM ETEnd date: September 14 at 4:59 PM ET / 7:59 PM ETTera type: FireHow To Join Tera RaidsBefore you can join an event raid, you need to make sure your game is up to date. After you've fired up your copy of either Scarlet or Violet, press the X button to open the menu, select Poke Portal, and choose Check Poke Portal News. Afterward, the latest event Pokemon should begin appearing in your game.Once you're up to date, you'll be able to find event raid dens across the Paldea region. Unlike most other events, the shiny Treasures of Ruin will be five-star raid bosses, so they shouldn't be quite as challenging as other special raids. However, you'll still have the best chance of success if you team up with other players online.How To Claim Mystery GiftsOnce the Mystery Gift distributions begin, you need to launch your copy of Scarlet or Violet and follow these steps to claim the shiny legendary Pokemon:Press X to open the menuSelect Poke PortalSelect Mystery Gift, then choose Get via InternetSelect the gift you want to claimSave your gameA few other bonuses may also be available depending on how successful players are. For every 100,000 victories that players achieve after the initial one million goal is met, The Pokemon Company will give out a Tera Shard Set that contains 40 Tera Shards.Distribution PeriodsAs noted above, shiny Wo-Chien is available now via Mystery Gift alongside some Tera Shard Sets until the end of September. Additional distributions will be announced in the coming weeks as the other Tera raid events end.You can see the current distribution schedule below:Shiny Wo-Chien: August 8 - September 30Shiny Chien-Pao: August 21 - September 30Shiny Ting-Lu: September 4 - 30Shiny Chi-Yu: TBAIf you miss your chance to participate in these raid events, you may yet have another opportunity to get the shiny Treasures of Ruin. The Pokemon Company says that these legendary Pokemon "may be featured in future events or become obtainable through other methods."The shiny Treasures of Ruin events will lead up to the release of the series' next installment, Pokemon Legends: Z-A, which launches for both the original Switch and the Switch 2 on October 16. The upcoming title is set entirely within Lumiose City, which is undergoing a redevelopment plan to make it more habitable for both people and Pokemon.
