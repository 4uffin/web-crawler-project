Today, during the Nintendo Direct livestream, a new trailer for Tomodachi Life: Living The Dream premiered. Not only did the video share new details on how we'll customize Miis and see them interact with each other, but it also announced that the game's launch window has narrowed to Spring 2026.The trailer begins with a quick look at life on the island of Living The Dream, with some Miis doing yoga in front of a sunflower bed, while others sit by a fountain and chat. One elderly Mii stands by the ocean and shouts "When is the game coming out?" before the scene shifts to actual gameplay. Next, we get a glimpse at the Mii creator, which will allow players to customize each Mii's appearance, personality traits, and even the tone of their voice. From there, we see a few of the activities a player's created Miis can enjoy, including a quick bite to eat, home customization, and interactions with other Miis on the streets of the town.Tomodachi Life: Living The Dream is set to launch Spring 2026 exclusively on Nintendo Switch. Preorders for the game are available now, as they began when it was first announced during the Nintendo Direct in April.Today's Nintendo Direct also featured news on the company's plans for the Super Mario Bros. 40th Anniversary celebration, which included multiple game announcements and a first look at the next theatrical release, The Super Mario Galaxy Movie. Key Switch 2 releases--including Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, Hades 2, and Final Fantasy VII Intergrade--also received solid release dates, while new entries in the Fire Emblem and Pokemon franchises were also unveiled.Nintendo Direct September 2025: All The Biggest AnnouncementsSee More
