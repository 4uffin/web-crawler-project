Borderlands games are all about chasing down rate loot, and for Borderlands 4, players can once again expect to plug in some Shift codes to grab an instant high-caliber upgrade. Borderlands 4 supports Shift codes, and the ones that can be redeemed for Golden Keys will let you open the unique Golden chests found in Belton's Bore, The Launchpad, Carcadia, or The Lockaway.We're still betting that each code you redeem will still give you Golden Keys that can be used to unlock a treasure chest of rare goodies in the game or new cosmetics that you can apply to your Vault Hunter. We'll be keeping track of Shift codes and the games you can redeem them in, so you can check back often for updates.Borderlands 4 Shift CodesB9XT3-HX6TT-W6BBW-TTJT3-JTFKX (1 x Golden Key) [Expires September 16]39RTT-3ZR3T-5FJBK-3J3J3-C5CRT (1 x Golden Key) [Expires September 16]THRBT-WW6CB-56TB5-3B3BJ-XBW3X (1 x Golden Key) [Expires September 20]T9RJB-BFKRR-3RBTW-B33TB-KCZB9 (1 x Golden Key) [Expires October 1]THRBT-WW6CB-56TB5-3B3BJ-XBW3X (1 x Golden Key) [Expires September 30]WHWJB-XH3SX-39CZW-H3BBB-BTF55 (1 x Golden Key) [Requires linked My2K Games account, expires October 1]How to redeem Shift codesTo redeem your Shift code, you'll first need to create a Shift account on the Gearbox website. This is quick and easy to do, and you can then activate your Shift codes on the same website or via the in-game Social menu or via Borderland 4's Social menu at launch. The other thing to note about Shift codes is that they typically have expiration dates, so it's a good idea to redeem one as soon as possible.From there, you can bank the rewards if they turn out to be Golden Keys, or splurge and use all of them to grab some new gear in one go.One important note: The rewards contained within these chests scale to your current level, so you may want to consider waiting to use a Golden Key. Otherwise, using one early in the game will net you low-level gun as opposed to one you can use long-term.For more on Borderlands 4, you can see how Gearbox plans to keep you looting and shooting after launch, how to get a free Borderlands 4 gun skin, and this deep dive into every Vault Hunter in the game.
