EA's newly launched Skate game is out now for free on PlayStation and Xbox consoles--but there is no Switch 2 version. In addition to the other existing skateboarding games on Switch 2, another game has now been confirmed for release on Nintendo's hybrid console.Skate Story, an independent game developed by Sam Eng and published by Devolver, is coming to Switch 2 later this year. The game has a rad art style and story setup. You play as a demon in the underworld, and your body is made out of "glass and pain." The devil gave you a skateboard and your goal is to skate to the Moon and swallow it to escape hell. "Ollie, kickflip, and grind your way through the ash and smoke of The Emptylands as you take on a seemingly impossible quest. Learn to master your weight and motion to conquer the weeping concrete. Savor the ritualistic beauty as you set your feet to pop a perfect kickflip," reads a line from the game's description.Skate Story was announced earlier this year and is also headed to the PlayStation 5 and PC. An Xbox version has not been announced, however.Skate Story will join the other skateboarding games on Switch and Switch 2, including Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2 and 3+4, as well as Skate Bird, Skater XL, Session, and OlliOlli World.As for EA's Skate, the game looks like a success with two million people playing in the first 24 hours. The game is available in early access and will remain in that state for about a year. If you're just getting started with the new Skate, check out the gallery below, which covers a few things you need to know before dropping in.Skate Tips: 7 Things To Know Before You Drop In To EA's Skate RevivalSee More
