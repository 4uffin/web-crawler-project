Each Deluxe Edition of Trigun is printed in hardcover format on high-quality 7" x 10" pages. The books have red leatherette covers with burnishing, foil-stamped lettering, and an image of a weapon from the series. These weighty tomes also include built-in bookmarks.Trigun Deluxe Edition clocks in at 704 pages and is the best way to read the manga in physical format.Illustrated and written by Yasuhiro Nightow, this book sets the stage for Vash the Stampede and the hostile alien planet he calls home. Essentially a sci-fi western, Trigun follows Vash as he attempts to non-violently dissuade bounty hunters from trying to claim the $60 billion mark on his head. While Vash is a force to be reckoned with when he does choose to draw his gun or unleash an internal weapon that can punch a hole in the planet, he's also a pacifist at heart.Unfortunately, with so many people after him, he also leaves a trail of destruction in his wake and he has become known as the Humanoid Typhoon because of these misadventures.

From a visual perspective, Trigun Stampede is one of the best Japanese anime created with CGI. It looks delightful, with impressive fluidity that sets a high benchmark for other anime productions. This version of Trigun also makes major changes to the storyline, and while opinions might differ on these narrative tweaks, you might find yourself pleasantly surprised at how they improve on the original saga.Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter: More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals & Preorders
