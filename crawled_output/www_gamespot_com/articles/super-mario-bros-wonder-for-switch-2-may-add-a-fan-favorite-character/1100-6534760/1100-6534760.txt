Super Mario Bros. Wonder is getting a Switch 2 Edition, and now fans think Nintendo may have accidentally revealed Rosalina will become new playable character.The trailer for the Switch 2 version of Super Mario Bros. Wonder that premiered during the most recent Nintendo Direct focused on the addition of Bellabel Park, a collection of multiplayer minigames exclusive to the Switch 2 version where players can either team up or compete against each other. One eagle-eyed fan, DynamoSuperX on X (via IGN), spotted a vs minigame icon at around the 2:00 minute mark in the trailer that clearly shows an image of Yoshi next to Rosalina, seemingly confirming her inclusion in the upcoming rerelease of the platformer. Rosalina isn't in the original version of the game. However, Nintendo did state during the trailer that there would be additional new content coming to the Switch 2 Edition of Super Mario Bros. Wonder, but that it would share more details at a later date. It certainly seems like Rosalina might be one of the surprises Nintendo was looking to keep under wraps until closer to the game's release.Her inclusion would make sense given Nintendo's all-in push for Super Mario Galaxy. Nintendo during its latest direct announced remastered versions of Super Mario Galaxy 1+2 are coming this year and that the name of Universal's Super Mario Bros. Movie sequel, scheduled to release April 2026, will be The Super Mario Galaxy Movie. Rosalina was introduced in the first Super Mario Galaxy back in 2007, and fans can even preorder a physical version of Rosalina's storybook from the game.Super Mario Bros. Wonder + Meet Up In Bellabel Park is slated to release in 2026, joining a growing collection of Switch games like Super Mario Party Jamboree and Kirby and The Forgotten Land with Switch 2 Editions that pack in exclusive content.Every Game Getting "Switch 2 Edition" Enhanced VersionsSee More
