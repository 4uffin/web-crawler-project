Spider-Man fans can score an absurdly good deal on the Lego Miles Morales' Mask display model at Walmart. Launched in July for $70, the 487-piece Miles Morales building set is on sale for only $28.24. This deal is unlikely to remain in stock for long, so snag it while you can.

$28.24 (was $70)
The 487-piece build is exclusive to Walmart and the Lego Store--though you'll pay $70 if you buy it directly from Lego right now.The completed 3D model with display stand measures 7.5 inches. A Lego Marvel name placard connects to the front of the stand.Despite low piece counts, Lego's mask and helmet builds are fairly complex and are recommended for adults and experienced builders.

Lego Spider-Man Mask (487 Pieces)
$70
The standard Spider-Man Mask Lego set launched last year exclusively at Target and the Lego Store. Based on Peter Parker's classic costume, the Spider-Man Mask is the same size as Miles Morales' Mask; it even has the same number of pieces.

Lego Miles Morales' Mask + Iron Spider-Man Bust Bundle
$92 (was $130)
Walmart also has an exclusive bundle with Miles Morales' Mask and the Iron Spider-Man Bust, which launched in August for $60. With Walmart's deal on Miles Morales' Mask, it's actually cheaper to buy each set separately.In any case, Walmart is currently sold out of the Spider-Man bundle--though the retailer has restocked a bunch of its Bricktember Lego bundles over the past few weeks. We wouldn't be surprised to see this one back in stock soon.Includes:Miles Morales' Mask (76329) - $70 (487 pieces)Iron Spider-Man Bust (76326) - $60 (379 pieces)

For some much smaller Lego Spider-Man fun, check out the new Spider-Verse minifigure collection. Based on Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, the collection features 12 characters from the multiverse. Most retailers are sold out of this collection, but Amazon just restocked the Spider-Verse minifigure 6-packs for $30.
