The Legend of Zelda fans don't have to wait too much longer to return to the world of Tears of the Kingdom. As announced during the September Nintendo Direct, Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment launches November 6 exclusively on Switch 2. Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment preorders opened September 12 at major retailers. Like most Switch 2 games published by Nintendo so far, Age of Imprisonment is priced at $70.Nintendo-published games rarely have preorder bonuses, but it's possible we'll see exclusive Zelda-themed trinkets at major retailers in the coming weeks.
Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment for Nintendo Switch 2
$70 | Releases November 6
Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment's physical and digital versions retail for $70. Preorders are available at Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy, and GameStop.For the physical edition, the full file is stored on the Switch 2 Game Card. This has been the case with all exclusives, but it's worth repeating here because of the game's file size. Age of Imprisonment is 44.9GB, according to the eShop store page, so it will take up roughly 20% of the console's usable space if you purchase the digital version.

If you opt for the digital edition and want to expand your storage space, Amazon has restocked the officially licensed Samsung 256GB microSD Express Card for $59. For a higher-capacity card, we'd recommend the SanDisk Gameplay 512GB microSD Express Card at Walmart. This exclusive card is virtually identical to the $120 SanDisk model, but it's sold for only $78 exclusively at Walmart.Age of Calamity is the third game in Koei Tecmo's Dynasty Warriors and Zelda crossover series. Like the previous two entries, Age of Imprisonment is a hack-and-slash action game that can be played solo or cooperatively with another player. It features a large cast of playable characters, led by Princess Zelda. This means that the two most recent Legend of Zelda games have actually starred Zelda. Last year, the heroine was the lead protagonist in The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, the first mainline entry led by any character beyond Link.Just as Age of Calamity served as a prequel to Breath of the Wild, Age of Imprisonment takes place before the events depicted in Tears of the Kingdom. The story revolves around Demon King Ganondorf's previous attempt to take control of Hyrule. This invasion is referenced in Tears of the Kingdom, and now fans will get to see how it all went down. Other playable characters beyond Zelda include King Rauru, Mineru, and other Sages. Most importantly, you can play as a Korok.Age of Imprisonment supports GameShare on Switch 2, so you can play with a friend over local wireless with only one copy of the game. All Zelda Amiibo figures are compatible with the new game. Scanning Amiibo figures will drop crafting materials and other items.If you haven't played Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity, it's worth noting that anyone with a save file on their console will get the High Guard's Claymore weapon in Age of Imprisonment. You'll also get the High Guard's Sword if you have a Tears of the Kingdom save file.Hyrule Warriors and Zelda Games for Switch 1/2Hyrule Warriors: Definitive Edition / Tears of the Kingdom Switch 2 Edition / Age of CalamityIf you want to catch up or revisit the previous Hyrule Warriors games ahead of Age of Imprisonment's release, Woot has physical editions of Hyrule Warriors: Definitive Edition and Age of Calamity for $50 each. These are international editions, but the Switch and Switch 2 are region-free, so the only tangible difference will be the ratings board logo on the cover. Walmart has US editions for $55.Hyrule Warriors: Definitive EditionWoot -- $50 ($60) | ImportWalmart -- $55 ($60)Hyrule Warriors: Age of CalamityWoot -- $50 ($60) | ImportWalmart -- $55 ($60)Even though Age of Imprisonment takes place before Tears of the Kingdom, you will almost certainly get more out of the story if you've played the brilliant open-world adventure. The Nintendo Switch 2 Edition is available for $79, or you can grab the Switch version for $59 and purchase a $10 Switch 2 Upgrade Pack from the eShop.
