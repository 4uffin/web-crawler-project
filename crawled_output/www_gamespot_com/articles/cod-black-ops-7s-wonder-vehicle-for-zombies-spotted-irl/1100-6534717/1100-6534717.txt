Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 arrives this November, and it includes another year of Treyarch's Zombies mode. Black Ops 7 adds the addition of a "Wonder Vehicle" for Zombies, and some fans have already spotted a real-life version of this new vehicle that's being created.As previously reported by CharlieIntel, fans with a keen eye have spotted the Black Ops 7 Wonder Vehicle in the background of Mizkif's IRL stream. The stream took place at West Coast Customs, which is the California-based auto shop famous for customizing cars for celebrities and major brands.An IRL version of the Black Ops 7 Wonder Vehicle was spotted in background of Mizkif IRL stream that took place at West Coast Customs pic.twitter.com/UE1cqhCScZ

As seen in the image above, the vehicle at West Coast Customs features the same design as the front end of the Wonder Vehicle we were shown during an early Black Ops 7 preview at Treyarch's studio. It has three demonic mouths coming out of the front grill, which look very similar to the mouths of the Abomination enemy-type in Zombies.This image doesn't show the full-length design, but in the teaser we saw the Wonder Vehicle was an armored SUV-style ride, and the body of the vehicle was wrapped in chains and monstrous-looking tendrils.Treyarch recently posted a teaser image of the Wonder Vehicle, which shows a closeup of the vehicle's hood and the monstrous tendrils that cover it.Black Ops 7 will launch with the largest round-based map the mode has ever seen, and the Wonder Vehicle will be used to traverse the dangerous roads that connect different areas of the map. Both the map design and Wonder Vehicle are inspired by Black Ops 2's Tranzit map, which featured a bus that transported players across deadly stretches of road.The developer said more Zombies information would be revealed this week. Additional Black Ops 7 details and live gameplay will arrive during the Call of Duty: Next event on September 30. Last year's Call of Duty: Next event featured a giant, articulated-model of the Abomination creature, so it's likely this Wonder Vehicle is being created specifically for this year's event.Most recently, Activision announced visual changes for the operators in the Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Vault Edition. Make sure to check out all the major Black Ops 7 announcements so far.
