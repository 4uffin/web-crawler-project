Microsoft is testing a new way to access Task View on Windows 11 with an Xbox controller. By long pressing the Xbox button on a PC, Task View will appear, allowing users to switch between say a game and Discord, for example.This Xbox controller change is only available in preview builds on Windows 11, according to Microsoft. The tweak won't change other functionality with the Xbox button, such as a short press for the Game Bar and holding it to turn off the controller.Keep in mind that the upcoming ROG Xbox Alley handhelds feature an Xbox button on the device and run Windows 11. That means accessing Task View should operate in the same way on those new devices, once Microsoft rolls out the change to the general public on PC, too.Last month, Microsoft announced that the ROG Xbox Alley handhelds will launch October 16. The Xbox Alley device will be the cheaper option with a 720p display, while the Xbox Alley X features a 1080p display. However, exact pricing still isn't known for the portable devices. There have been previous reports of the base model starting at $550 and the premium system retailing for $900. For more, check out GameSpot's ROG Xbox Ally X impressions.
