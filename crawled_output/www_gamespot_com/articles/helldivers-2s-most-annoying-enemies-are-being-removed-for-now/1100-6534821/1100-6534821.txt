You ever drop into Helldivers 2 to complete some missions, only to get bodied by the most frustrating enemy over and over again? Developer Arrowhead Game Studios has heard your concerns and, in an effort to alleviate that frustration, will temporarily disable the Rupture Strain subfaction later today.In a post on the official Helldivers 2 Discord, community manager Katherine Baskin said the Rupture Strain--that subfaction of Terminids from The Gloom--started behaving in unintended ways as a result of the September 16 patch and "other issues" regarding their balance. As such, these insectoids will be pulled offline today so the developers can iron out any of the kinks.

Introduced on September 2, the Rupture Strain has been rupturing brains and straining fingers as divers of all stripes get demolished by the spider-like creatures. Since they've invaded Super Earth, the Helldivers 2 community has grown tired of trying to avoid dying in battle against these bugs. A popular post on the game's subreddit, titled "Done with the rupture strain..." and posted on September 7, lists all the ways they "aren't fun to play against." Another one, posted a day before this news came out, simply sighed at the idea that the Rupture Strain was getting buffed. While there are plenty of posts praising the "unique challenge" they present, most of the sentiment around the Rupture Strain has been pure exasperation.Helldivers 2 is available on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. While the Rupture Strain will no longer roam The Gloom for the next five weeks, that doesn't mean there aren't things for you to do around Super Earth. Arrowhead Game Studios recently dropped a substantial patch that addresses myriad crashes and issues, and earlier this month, the team released the latest premium Warbound, Dust Devils, which introduced new guns, skins, and other rewards.Helldivers 2 Dust Devils Warbond - All Skins, Guns, And RewardsSee More
