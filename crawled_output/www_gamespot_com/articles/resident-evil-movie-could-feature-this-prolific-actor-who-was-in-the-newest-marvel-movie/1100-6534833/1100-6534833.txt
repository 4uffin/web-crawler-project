The upcoming Resident Evil movie from Barbarian and Weapons director Zach Cregger is adding Paul Walter Hauser to its cast, according to a new report.Hauser would join Austin Abrams--who also starred in Weapons--in the cast for the new Resident Evil movie. Deadline first reported Hauser's involvement in Resident Evil.Hauser is a veteran actor who recently garnered acclaim for The Luckiest Man in America, a movie that chronicled the story of Michael Larson's huge success on the '80s game show Press Your Luck. He is also known for his starring role in the 2019 Clint Eastwood movie Richard Jewell and for his parts in Cobra Kai, The Fantastic Four: First Steps, The Naked Gun, and I, Tonya.The Resident Evil movie is due to begin shooting this October in Prague, so it's likely we'll soon learn more about the cast.The film doesn't re-tell any of the game stories but Cregger, who co-wrote the script with Shay Hatten and is directing, said it "lives in the world" of Resident Evil 2 and 3. At the same time, it adheres more to the tone of Resident Evil 4, he said."I've never seen a movie like it," he added. "I am beyond excited making this," he said.Paul W.S. Anderson made six Resident Evil movies before, but Cregger has seen none of them and says fans of those films may not enjoy his. Sony Pictures distributed the previous Resident Evil movies, which made more than $1 billion collectively, and the company is also distributing Cregger's movie.The new Resident Evil movie is slated for release on September 18, 2026. Sony Pictures is also distributing the live-action Zelda movie, which is coming to theaters in May 2027.As for the Resident Evil game series, Capcom is launching Resident Evil 9: Requiem in February 2026, alongside Resident Evil ports for Switch 2.49 Video Game Movies In The Works: How Many Of Them Will Actually Come Out?See More
