Seinfeld is regarded as one of the best comedy sitcoms of all time, but series co-creator followed it up with an even series: Curb Your Enthusiasm. Across 12 seasons spanning 25 years, Larry David consistently demonstrated he's one of the funniest writers and actors working in television. And while it's sad Curb is over, it's one of those shows that continues to be brilliant and hilarious even after you've watched it several times. Next month would be a pretty, pretty, pretty good time to rewatch the series, as Curb Your Enthusiasm will finally be available on Blu-ray. Curb Your Enthusiasm: The Complete Series is available to preorder for $130 at Amazon ahead of its October 14 launch.

Curb Your Enthusiasm: The Complete Series is a 24-disc Blu-ray box set with all 12 seasons of the beloved comedy. Each season of Curb has 10 episodes with runtimes of roughly 30 minutes, so all 120 episodes will take you 60 hours to watch.Up until now, each season has only been available on DVD, so it's pretty, pretty, pretty exciting to have the full series on Blu-ray. One question that fans probably have: How does this box set handle the early seasons? The first six seasons of Curb were filmed and displayed in 4:3 aspect ratio. If you stream the series on HBO Max, the early episodes are rendered in 16:9 widescreen like the last six seasons. According to the back of the box, every episode will be displayed in 1080p high definition, so you can expect 16:9 aspect ratio for every episode.For audio, Seasons 1-6 support Dolby Digital 2.0, and Seasons 7-12 have Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound.The back of the box mentions several featurettes and bonus content while noting there's "much more" than what's listed below:A Seinfeld Moment on Curb: Interview with Larry David and the Seinfeld CastLeon's Guide to NYCLarry's Favorite EpisodesBTS of the Final SceneGag Reel

Larry David shaking a flat Blu-ray box set, wondering why it's not a box.The HBO series kicked off in 2000, two years after Seinfeld wrapped, and ended its run in 2024. If you haven't watched Curb, Larry David stars as himself, the co-creator of Seinfeld. Curb Your Enthusiasm's similar style of humor, wit, and outlandish antics make it feel like a spiritual successor to Seinfeld. But since Curb aired on HBO, it had the freedom to cross lines a network TV show like Seinfeld can't get away with.The Complete Series box set originally released on DVD last October with a $150 MSRP. The DVD box set actually still sells for $150, if you buy it directly from Amazon--third-party sellers have the DVD box set for as low as $80.You can also stream the complete series on Max, buy digital episodes from platforms like Prime Video, or pick up all 12 seasons on DVD.Seinfeld released on 4K Blu-ray and Blu-ray last fall. The 4K Blu-ray edition is quite pricey at $221 (was $250), but the standard Blu-ray set is available for the same price as Curb's box set. You can also buy Seinfeld: The Complete Series on DVD for $75.
