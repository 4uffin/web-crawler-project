The former Disco Elysium devs at Dark Math Games' upcoming spiritual successor, XXX Nightshift, didn't have a name that conveyed it was a detective-RPG rather than something more adult in nature. Thankfully, the publisher has announced a name change for the game, which will now be known as Tangerine Antarctic.The title of the game isn't the only thing that's changing. Dark Math Games has announced that the title's isometric gameplay is being abandoned in favor of a third-person experience. As for the game's name, Tangerine Antarctic is the name of the exclusive Antarctic hotel where the story is set. It's also about to be the staging ground for a murder in the middle of a blizard.Tangerine Antarctic is a single-player experience designed to respond to the choices that players make in the game. Players are invited to solve the case at their own pace and they can even choose a partner to help them find clues and identify the suspect or suspects. There's more than one way to get to the bottom of this mystery, and the character's partner allows different avenues to be explored.Players can also access a maboul kit that will let them "prepare for interrogations, confrontations, and seductions." However, the game's description warns about side effects and adds that "there's always a price to pay."Tangerine Antarctic is currently available to wish list on Steam for PC. A release date hasn't been announced yet.The Best PC Games To Play In 2025See More
