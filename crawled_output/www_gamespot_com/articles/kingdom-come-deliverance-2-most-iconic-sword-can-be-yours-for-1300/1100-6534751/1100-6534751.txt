Kingdom Come: Deliverance fans can now own a replica of the game's most iconic sword, but it won't come cheap.In partnership with Kingdom Come developer Warhorse Studios, historical arms and prop shop Wulflund has released an impressive replica of Sir Radzig's longsword that captures the weapon's various details perfectly. The Latin inscription on the blade is hand etched, while the grip is wrapped in cowhide leather with bronze rings "electroplated to an antique silver finish." Though the weapon is blunt and is intended as a decoration that "must not be used for combat purposes," Wulflund also states the weapon has excellent balance, "giving it speed and agility and allowing for better tip control."In Kingdom Come: Deliverance, the sword is meant as a special gift for a local lord. The price for this replica certainly reflects that, as it will cost fans $1,303 dollars before taxes and shipping."Radzig's sword is not a mere copy," Wulflund states. "It is a dignified tribute to a story that has etched itself into the hearts of fans. It was created with respect for history, the gaming legend, and those who brought it to life."Sir Radzig's sword is more than just a cool weapon--it's an heirloom upon which much of Kingdom Come: Deliverance's story revolves. In the first game, protagonist Henry promised to deliver the sword to Sir Radzig on his blacksmith father's request, only for a raid on his village to result in the death of his parents. Henry later loses the sword but over the course of the story retrieves it and is able to deliver the sword to its rightful owner, fulfilling the promise to his father. The weapon returns in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2.Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is among the best-selling games of 2025 so far, and even found itself (somewhat controversially) on a BAFTA list of the 21 most influential games. A "cinematic cut" of the game recently screened at a European film festival.
