The lowest rung of the Game Pass ladder is receiving a small but significant expansion, with Xbox adding three games to the Game Pass Core catalog.Starting October 1, subscribers can play Cities: Skylines – Remastered, Disney Dreamlight Valley, and Warhammer 40,000: Darktide at no additional cost. The three titles will join a line-up of just a little over 50 games in Game Pass Core, which costs $9.99 USD a month.for XGP Core subscriber eyes only pic.twitter.com/dYZ78LMNun

Cities: Skylines – Remastered, as the title implies, is an enhanced rerelease of the 2015 city-building game. The remaster was released in 2023, and those who owned the Xbox One version of the game were able to upgrade to the remastered version for free. Interestingly, the Xbox One version is already included in Game Pass Core.Disney Dreamlight Valley is a popular life simulator that features characters from various Disney properties. Very much like Animal Crossing, Disney Dreamlight Valley has players maintaining a community, cooking recipes, and befriending villagers. The game is still receiving regular content updates, with the next one set to incorporate horseback riding.Finally, Warhammer 40,000: Darktide is a first-person cooperative action game that has four players team up to fight waves of enemies. On its 2022 release, GameSpot's review of Darktide said the game's "combat, pacing, and team builds are expertly considered and crafted."Of course, if you're already subscribed to the Standard or Ultimate plans for Game Pass, you can already install and play all three of these titles. The premium tiers of Game Pass are receiving some heavy hitters throughout September, including Hades, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, and Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor, with a few titles leaving this month as well.Xbox Game Pass Expands With 13 More Games In SeptemberSee More
