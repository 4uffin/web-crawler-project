Hollow Knight: Silksong is finally out, and with the entire internet talking about Team Cherry's long-in-development metroidvania, you might be feeling some FOMO about it. The good news is that the game is relatively cheap to purchase, and if you're looking to save a few extra bucks, you can score a discount on the Steam version and some free games if you happen to be a Humble Choice subscriber. Right now, you can get the game at a 15% discount, dropping the price of Silksong from $20 to $17. Humble has temporarily sold out of keys at the moment, but a restock is on the way. Sign up for Humble Choice This deal is one of the perks that Humble Choice subscribers get with their monthly membership, which costs $15 a month. Alongside new PC games that are refreshed every month, you also get access to the Humble Vault--an additional rotating library of games. The best thing about the membership is that the PC games you claim are yours to keep forever, even if you decide to cancel your membership. This month is also pretty good, as you can pick up WWE 2K25, Destiny 2: Legacy Collection, The Plucky Squire, Return to Monkey Island, and more.If you bought Silksong and didn't get your Steam key before it sold out, Humble is offering DRM-free keys as an alternative. Speaking of DRM-free keys, you can get Silksong at its regular price of $20 through GOG. The benefit here is that you're getting a DRM-free version of the game, which means the license for it will never be revoked and it can play without needing to start through a launcher. You can also easily load it onto a mobile gaming PC like an Asus ROG Ally and keep on playing, even when you're in an internet dead zone. See at GOG While Silksong is out, you might have to wait a little longer to play it as various digital storefronts are experiencing a few issues. Steam, the Nintendo eShop, the PlayStation Network, and Xbox appear to be buckling under the strain of excited players, and on Steam alone, the game reached more than 100,000 concurrent players in under an hour. If the Nintendo eShop is still down for you, Amazon is selling digital Silksong keys for Switch. See at Amazon
