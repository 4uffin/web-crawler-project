Nearly three decades ago, Matthew Lillard and Skeet Ulrich shared the screen as Stu Macher and Billy Loomis in Scream. Later this year, Lillard and Ulrich are reuniting for Five Nights at Freddy's 2, the sequel to the 2023 adaptation of the hit video game franchise. Ulrich's character hasn't been revealed yet, but Lillard couldn't resist teasing it during their joint appearance at Silver Scream Con."I am thrilled to have [Ulrich] in the community," said Lillard via Bloody Disgusting. "I saw his performance this week. They're gonna love it. He's playing a great character. If the movie’s successful, hopefully he comes back.""I always love spending time with Matt," noted Ulrich. "He's one of the greatest people I know, quite honestly. As you guys have experienced, he's such a giving man. I always like spending time with him, and [Five Nights at Freddy’s 2] was no exception."Lillard is reprising his role as William Afton, the creator of the murderous animatronic creatures he created with the spirits of dead children. During the convention, he also hinted at Afton's transformation into Springtrap, and why he refused to voice the character in Dead by Daylight's collaboration with Five Nights At Freddy's."In... Dead by Daylight, the video game, they wanted me to do the Springtap lines," recalled Lillard. "I'm like, 'I'm not doing Springtap until I do Springtap in the movie.' So the only way I do Springtap is that people go see the movie on December 5! And then we make a third."Five Nights at Freddy's 2 will feature returning cast members Josh Hutcherson as Mike Schmidt, Piper Rubio as Abby Schmidt, and Elizabeth Lail as Vanessa Afton. Mckenna Grace and Teo Briones have also joined the cast as a pair of paranormal hunters, with Wayne Knight slated to appear in an undisclosed role.As noted above by Lillard, Five Nights at Freddy's 2 will hit theaters on December 5. Before that happens, fans on both coasts of the U.S. can catch Five Nights At Freddy's houses during Universal Studios and Universal Orlando's Halloween Horror Nights.27 Best Horror Games To Play In The Dark In 2025See More
