The arrival of Persona 5's Phantom Thieves in Overwatch 2 on September 16 will mean more than just hearts are about to be stolen, as the game is set to introduce a number of new premium cosmetics based on Atlus' stylish JRPG that likely won't come cheap. [Update: You can check out all of the Overwatch x Persona 5 skins, emotes, and rewards in our gallery.]All Overwatch 2 Persona 5 Skins, Emotes, And RewardsSee MoreAfter having previously teased the collab, Blizzard has finally revealed the five main cosmetics players will be able to purchase as part of the Season 18 crossover. They are:Wuyang as JokerMercy as PantherLifeweaver as FoxD.Va as QueenGenji as SkullGallery
Whereas previous Overwatch collabs like Gundam Wing or Avatar: The Last Airbender have seen Blizzard put its own spin on how Overwatch's heroes might cosplay various characters, there isn't much creative license on display here. The Persona 5 skins for Overwatch 2 make the game's heroes look exactly as you expect them to, so much so that it is actually a little difficult to realize what hero is underneath the costume. There are, however, a few flourishes, such as rose petals falling from Mercy's wings and Wuyang's staff evoking Joker's Persona Arsene.Wuyang is Overwatch 2's newest support hero and as such doesn't have many cosmetics to choose from just yet, so it's nice that he is featured prominently as part of the crossover. Mercy, on the other hand, is one of the game's most popular characters and is often featured in crossovers, so her donning the look of Panther is a bit of a no brainer. Blizzard hasn't released the exact prices for the skins just yet, but expect them to be similar to that of previous crossovers, which usually cost around 2,800 ($28) Overwatch Coins per skin bundle.Artwork created for the Overwatch 2 x Persona 5 collab by Atlus artist Shigenori Soejima.Outside of new skins, a few of Persona 5's visual flourishes will also make their way into Overwatch 2's menus, including a new piece of key art from Atlus character artist Shigenori Soejima. A Phantom Thieves-inspired overlay will also appear when viewing the Persona 5 cosmetics in the game's shop, a first for a collab, according to Blizzard.For those who aren't keen on opening their wallets to the Phantom Thieves, Overwatch 2 collabs usually bring some freebies in the form of sprays, weapon charms, and player icons for those who complete various challenges. Overwatch 2's Persona 5 crossover will be live September 16-30.Overwatch 2 Battle Pass Season 18: All Skins, Emotes, And RewardsSee More
