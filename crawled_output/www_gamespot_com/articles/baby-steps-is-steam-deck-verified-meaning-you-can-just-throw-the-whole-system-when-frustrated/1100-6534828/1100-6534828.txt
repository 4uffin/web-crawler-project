Devolver Digital wants you to take Baby Steps with you as you get your steps in. That's because the odd walking simulator has officially been verified for Steam Deck, the portable PC handheld.Baby Steps sees players controlling Nate, who suddenly realizes that he has the power to walk. This leads to the unemployed character attempting to "find meaning in a wasted life," per the game's website. In addition, Devolver Digital notes on Steam that now Baby Steps players can help Nate ascend a mountain while they are actually on a mountain, too.Baby Steps is officially @Steam Deck Verified ✅In just 6 days you'll have the choice to join Nate on his adventure from the comfort of your local park, bus stop, or coffee shop restroom. The possibilities are endless ☕️ pic.twitter.com/cesVj1MBrZ
— Baby Steps - OUT SEPT 23! (@BabyStepsGame) September 17, 2025
Last week, the ESRB rating came out for Baby Steps, and it sure is something. The description for the game says the setting is "a mystical realm full of quirky and bizarre characters," and that includes "human/donkey hybrids with exposed male genitalia." Just to be clear, you shouldn't encounter similar people out on your walks with the game on Steam Deck. If you do, it's recommendable to call the authorities and run.Last month, Baby Steps was delayed to steer clear of Hollow Knight: Silksong. The developers--Bennett Foddy (Getting Over It), Gabe Cuzzillo (Ape Out), and Maxi Boch (Ape Out)--had fun with the release-date change, making a short trailer of Nate climbing on a statue of Hornet, the protagonist in Silksong.Baby Steps is set to launch September 23 on PC and PS5.The Biggest Game Releases Of September 2025See More
