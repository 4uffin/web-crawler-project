It's been almost six months since Mojang Studios hosted an installment of Minecraft Live, which provides a look ahead at what's coming to Minecraft. Now, the studio has set the next Minecraft Live for September 27 with a teaser trailer that may have some hints about what to expect. Minecraft Live will stream on Minecraft's official site, as well as the game's YouTube, Twitch, Instagram, and TikTok accounts. The start time will be September 27 10 AM PT/1 PM ET. So far, Mojang has only promised that the episode will feature "the inside scoop on unannounced game drops, insight from our developers, and more."As Mojang has done in the past, the Minecraft Live stream will be followed by a longer Deep Dig After Show, which will be hosted by Vu Bui. The after show will feature Minecraft developers and guests as they show off the game's upcoming features.Minecraft's next update, The Copper Age, is likely to be featured on Minecraft Live and may even be released this month. The update will introduce multiple uses for copper and feature the Copper Golem. Earlier this month, Minecraft debuted Superman-themed DLC that was inspired by the recent reboot movie.Outside of the franchise, Nintendo's upcoming cozy game Pokemon Pokopia appears to be borrowing elements from both Minecraft and Animal Crossing. But with the original Minecraft still as popular as ever, it doesn't seem likely to be dethroned anytime soon.25 Games Like Minecraft To Play In 2025See More
