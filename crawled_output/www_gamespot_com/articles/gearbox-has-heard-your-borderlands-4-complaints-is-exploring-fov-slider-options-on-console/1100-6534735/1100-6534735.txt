Borderlands 4 hasn't exactly been off to a flying start. While it's already developed a healthy playerbase, Steam reviews have not been so hot, primarily due to the game's performance issues. But it's not just PC players that are having trouble, as many players on console have been clamouring for a field-of-view slider option. And based on a recent tweet, it looks like such an option might be on the way.Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford shared a poll over the weekend on his personal X account asking console players about including a FOV setting. He noted that there are "some dreams" he has "where an FOV setting might affect fairness," but also said he couldn't talk about that. It seems like that didn't matter to most folks though, as the top rated result in the poll was "FOV slider or GTFO!" Following that, a post from the official Borderlands X account was shared essentially confirming that the devs will be looking into adding that in as an option.

Now Playing: Borderlands 4 Video Review
"Vault Hunters! We have heard your feedback on FOV (Field of View) sliders on console," reads the post. "The team is currently exploring how to bring these sliders to both Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5 versions. We will continue to read your feedback & prioritize game updates with your experience in mind. Thanks all!"That obviously isn't an outright confirmation, but it certainly seems likely. Just searching the Borderlands subreddit shows you how many people have been asking for FOV options on console, so it seems like a hard request to ignore.For more on the game, you can check out GameSpot's Borderlands 4 review, which found it to be a touch too much of an overcorrection.All Fadefields Vault Fragments In Borderlands 4See More
