Mega Man fans haven't seen Capcom's iconic hero in his own game since since Mega Man 11 in 2018, but the franchise hasn't been forgotten. 2026 will mark the 20th anniversary of the Mega Man Star Force games, and Capcom is celebrating by bringing all seven titles together in the Mega Man Star Force Legacy Collection. In 2006, Mega Man Star Force was the follow-up to the Mega Man Battle Network games. Star Force introduced players to a young boy named Geo Stelar who became a new Mega Man after merging with an alien, Omega-Xis, two hundred years after the final Battle Network game. Their adventures unfolded in seven action-RPG games before concluding in Mega Man Star Force 3: Red Joker in 2008.The seven Star Force games in the Legacy Collection are listed below:Mega Man Star Force PegasusMega Man Star Force LeoMega Man Star Force DragonMega Man Star Force 2 Zerker x NinjaMega Man Star Force 2 Zerker x SaurianMega Man Star Force 3 Black AceMega Man Star Force 3 Red JokerSince these games were originally designed for the Nintendo DS, the Legacy Collection will feature a dual-screen style that features both screens on a single TV screen. The Legacy Collection will also have an "enhanced experience" and allow players to trade card and battle each other online.Capcom hasn't set a specific date for Mega Man Star Force Legacy Collection beyond a vague 2026 release window. The game will be available on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC.Earlier this year, Capcom reiterated that Mega Man is one of its most important franchises. While there isn't any word about a new game, the original Mega Man animated series is coming to Blu-ray on October 28.The Best Mega Man Games, Ranked From Busted To Mega BusterSee More
