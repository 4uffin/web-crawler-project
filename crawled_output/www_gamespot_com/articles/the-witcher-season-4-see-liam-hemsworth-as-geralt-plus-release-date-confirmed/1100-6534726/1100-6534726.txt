The Witcher Season 4: See Liam Hemsworth As Geralt, Plus Release Date ConfirmedLiam Hemsworth steps into the role of Geralt of Rivia in the first teaser for The Witcher Season 4.By

It's been over two years since The Witcher Season 3 dropped on Netflix, which also marked Henry Cavill's departure from the series. Now, Netflix has dropped a teaser for The Witcher Season 4, including a first look at Liam Hemsworth as Geralt of Rivia, the role previously portrayed by Cavill. Netflix also set the show's return date for October 30. The teaser doesn't give us a good look at Geralt's companions, but it does depict his battle with a Wraith. It's hard to kill a creature that's largely intangible, but Geralt does have a way with dispatching monsters.Story details about the new season have yet to be disclosed, but we do know that Geralt, Yennefer (Anya Chalotra), and Ciri (Freya Allan) have been separated from each other. For now, it appears that all three of them are on solo journeys. But they'll almost certainly find their way back together at some point in the season.Laurence Fishburne joining the cast of The Witcher Season 4 in early 2024, and he'll be playing Regis, a "world-wide barber-surgeon with a mysterious past"--you can get a first look at Fishburne in character in the trailer. Some of the other new cast members in Season 4 include Sharlto Copley, James Purefoy, Danny Woodburn, Linden Porco, Eve Ridley, and Clive Russell.Outside of the Netflix series, The Witcher franchise continues to thrive. The concert tour for the music of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt started its American run earlier this month. CD Projekt Red is currently in development on The Witcher 4, which will be the first game in the series to feature Ciri as the leading character. Additionally, CD Projekt Red is producing a remake of The Witcher, which was first released in 2007. Fool's Theory will develop the remake, with the guidance of CD Projekt Red.Best Witcher 3 Mods To Download In 2025See More
