See at Amazon See at Walmart See at Lego Store
The 2025 Lego Advent Calendar collection launched September 1 with six themed offerings for early holiday shoppers to buy at Walmart, Amazon, Target, and the Lego Store. As usual, four editions are themed around popular entertainment and gaming franchises. This year's lineup includes annual mainstays Star Wars and Disney, the return of Harry Potter, and the first Lego Minecraft Advent Calendar. The Minecraft edition is likely to be very popular due to the surge in interest from the Minecraft Movie. Each Lego Advent Calendar comes with 24 miniature builds, one for each day in December leading up to Christmas. You'll get a mix of minifigures, vehicles, and other brick-built accessories themed around your favorite franchises. Lego's licensed Advent Calendars retail for $45 each, while the new Lego City and Lego Friends editions are $35. You don't need to pay these prices, though. Walmart has deals on all six calendars, and Amazon is matching offers for three of them as of September 18, including Star Wars and Harry Potter.Lego Advent Calendars 2025Lego Minecraft (300 pieces)Walmart -- $38 ($45)Amazon -- $45Lego Star Wars (263 pieces) Amazon -- $38 ($45)Walmart -- $38 ($45)Lego Harry Potter (278 pieces)Amazon -- $38 ($45)Walmart -- $38 ($45)Lego Disney: Frozen (231 pieces)Walmart -- $38 ($45)Amazon -- $45Lego City (186 pieces)Walmart -- $25 ($35)Amazon -- $30 ($35)Lego Friends (237 pieces)Amazon -- $25 ($35)Walmart -- $25 ($35)Lego Advent Calendars 2025 Walmart is actually offering deals on all six Lego Advent Calendars.
