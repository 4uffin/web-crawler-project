Technically, Mario Tennis Fever is the second Mario sports game to release exclusively on Switch 2. Nintendo recently added Super Mario Strikers to the GameCube catalog for Switch Online + Expansion Pack members. But Mario Tennis Fever is the first all-new Mario sports game for Switch 2.Mario Tennis Fever (Nintendo)Mario Tennis Fever will have local and online multiplayer for up to four players. It supports button/stick controls as well as motion controls with the Joy-Con 2. You'll be able to play as 38 different characters from the Mushroom Kingdom. The "Fever" moniker is a reference to this entry's new twist: Fever Rackets. There are 30 Fever Rackets with unique special effects such as freezing the court and shrinking your opponent's racket.In the new Adventure Mode, monsters who inhabit a mysterious island turn Mario, Luigi, Peach, Wario, and Waluigi into babies. Donkey Kong is also in the campaign, but he isn't a baby (sadly). Baby Mario and his friends will need to develop their tennis skills all over again to escape the island.Other game modes include Trial Towers, Tournament, Ranked Matches, Online Room, and Mix It Up. Mario Tennis Fever will borrow from Super Mario Bros. Wonder by having Talking Flowers commentate matches in Tournament Mode and by introducing Wonder Effects to Mix It Up Mode.
