There's never been a Rocket Pass like this one. With the launch of the new Rocket League season on Wednesday, we also got to start grinding on what is probably the most broadly appealing Rocket Pass Epic has yet produced in the five years since Rocket League went free-to-play. It's the first Rocket Pass to include two different licensed car bodies--a Pontiac Firebird, and a Chevrolet Astro van--and for good measure it's also got some incredible Sonic the Hedgehog items, including an awesome goal explosion and hamster-wheel-style rims in which a little Sonic runs when you accelerate.Check out the Chevy Astro and Pontiac Firebird car bodies included in the new Rocket Pass.Those items alone are worth the price of the pass, assuming you actually plan to spend time unlocking them, but Epic made that a little easier too this season with better XP gains just from playing matches, and by making certain things easier to unlock. For example, on previous passes that included a second vehicle body, you always had to grind to rank 40 to unlock them, but the Astro van is only at 33. Likewise, it has typically taken until rank 100 to unlock all the Rocket League Credits included in the pass, but on this pass you'll unlock them all by rank 69 (nice). Add in three really excellent goal explosions, including the Sonic one, and there's an excessive amount of cool stuff in this pass compared with past ones. This Rocket Pass will run until December 10, and it costs 1,000 Credits or a month of Fortnite Crew.All of the above also makes the new Rocket Pass an exceptional value for Fortnite players, since they can obtain the pass with a Fortnite Crew subscription--and unlike passes inside Fortnite, you won't lose access to the Rocket Pass when your Crew expires. Both the cars will transfer to Fortnite, as should the Sonic wheels and most of the other boosts, trails, and wheels in the pass. And the Astro van will be the first Fortnite SUV body that you don't have to buy in the item shop. And there is a pile of decals for the Firebird and the Astro to unlock as well. While you'll still have to play Rocket League to progress the pass, that grind should be easier this time out with Epic's recent changes to XP.Fortnite Festival Gorillaz Pass: Skins And RewardsSee More
