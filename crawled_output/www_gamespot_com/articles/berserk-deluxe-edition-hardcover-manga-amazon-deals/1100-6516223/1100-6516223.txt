New readers can pick up Berserk Deluxe Edition Vol. 1 for only $28.65 (was $50). The 696-page hardcover includes the first three volumes in Miura's brilliant and brutal tale of swords, sorcery, and defying fate.Berserk Deluxe Edition MangaBerserk Deluxe Vol. 1 -- $28.65 ($50)Berserk Deluxe Vol. 2 -- $28.75 ($50)Berserk Deluxe Vol. 3 -- $33 ($50)Berserk Deluxe Vol. 4 -- $32.52 ($50)Berserk Deluxe Vol. 5 -- $39.49 ($50)Berserk Deluxe Vol. 6 -- $30.89 ($50)Berserk Deluxe Vol. 7 -- $31.15($50)Berserk Deluxe Vol. 8 -- $34 ($50)Berserk Deluxe Vol. 9 -- $28.71 ($50)Berserk Deluxe Vol. 10 -- $29.82 ($50)Berserk Deluxe Vol. 11 -- $29.76 ($50)Berserk Deluxe Vol. 12 -- $28.37 ($50)Berserk Deluxe Vol. 13 -- $31 ($50)Berserk Deluxe Vol. 14 -- $30.29 ($50)Berserk Deluxe Editions (Dark Horse) Berserk is a dark fantasy series that follows Guts, a former mercenary on a quest for revenge. If you're willing to take the dive, you'll find a haunting and tragic story for mature audiences, as it holds nothing back and regularly delivers brutal content on every page.Each elegantly designed hardcover volume is made of durable leatherette and contains three individual volumes reprinted in oversized format. They are shrink-wrapped when purchased in new condition. These hardcovers are roughly 700 pages each, so they can take up considerable shelf space.Miura's final contributions to Berserk were collected in Deluxe Edition Vol. 14, the only Deluxe release that doesn't include three individual volumes. Instead, the newest Deluxe Edition pairs Volumes 40 and 41 with the Berserk Official Guidebook, which helps contextualize your reading experience with background information and expanded lore. The guidebook is also sold separately in paperback for $11.30 (was $15).Complete your Berserk CollectionDark Horse published Berserk Volume 42 in paperback and ebook format on March 18; fans can snag a paperback copy for $11.80 (was $15) at Amazon. It's the first new volume since Miura's death in 2021. The 192-page paperback comes with a fold-out, double-sided cover and continues the Fantasia storyline, the manga's fifth story arc. Volume 42's creation was overseen by Miura's best friend, Koji Mori, and written and illustrated by Miura's assistants.Another notable Berserk book to check out is The Flame Dragon Knight, a novel set in the world of Berserk. Based on a story idea by Kentaro Miura and written by Makoto Fukami, Berserk: The Flame Dragon Knight is a 192-page side story that chronicles the origins of one of Berserk's main antagonists. Berserk: The Flame Dragon Knight is available in paperback for $15.Berserk Manga Paperback Edition DealsBerserk Volume 42 If you'd prefer smaller books, all 42 volumes collected in the Deluxe Editions remain in print in traditional trade paperback. Each individual volume is roughly 200 pages and carries a $15 MSRP, though you can often save a few bucks on these at Amazon. We've listed the first 15 trade paperbacks below.Just keep in mind that it's frequently more expensive to buy three of the trade paperbacks instead of the corresponding hardcover edition. For instance, it would cost you roughly $36 to purchase the first three standard editions--eight bucks more than the first Deluxe Edition.Berserk Vol. 1 -- $11.45 ($15)Berserk Vol. 2 -- $10.17 ($15)Berserk Vol. 3 -- $14 ($15)Berserk Vol. 4 -- $13.55 ($15)Berserk Vol. 5 -- $12.19 ($15)Berserk Vol. 6 -- $9.24 ($15)Berserk Vol. 7 -- $12.64 ($15)Berserk Vol. 8 -- $13.57 ($15)Berserk Vol. 9 -- $9.24 ($15)Berserk Vol. 10 -- $15Berserk Vol. 11 -- $11.88 ($15)Berserk Vol. 12 -- $15Berserk Vol. 13 -- $14 ($15)Berserk Vol. 14 -- $13.61 ($15)Berserk Vol. 15 -- $14 ($15)

Berserk has received multiple TV and film adaptations over the years. The 1997 anime series remains the most beloved interpretation of Miura's story. It released on Blu-ray last year but is currently sold out.Berserk's Golden Age Arc, a trilogy of movies that debuted in 2012-13, also arrived on Blu-ray last year. The Golden Age Arc: Memorial Edition recuts the three movies into a 13-episode television-style arc. It's on sale for 35% off at Amazon, dropping the price to $45.80 (was $70).Lastly, there's the 2016 adaptation, which has its fans but is generally regarded as a missed opportunity due to subpar animation. Nevertheless, the 2016 series picks up where the Golden Age Arc ends and has some great characters and story threads across its 24-episode arc. Berserk 2016: The Complete Series on Blu-ray is up for grabs for $39.62 (was $70) at Amazon.
