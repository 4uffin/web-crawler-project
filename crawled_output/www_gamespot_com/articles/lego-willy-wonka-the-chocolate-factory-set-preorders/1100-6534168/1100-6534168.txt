The 1971 film Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory reamins one of the most iconic children's movies of all time, filled with memorable scenes and setpieces that still look great on screen even all these decades later. Starting today, Lego Insiders can recreate a blocky version of the titular Chocolate Factory's chocolate rivers and gumdrop trees with the new Lego Ideas: Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory Set. The 2,025-piece set launches for $220 on September 18 exclusively at Lego's online store, but members of the free Lego Insiders program can preorder early. All other customers can grab the set on September 18. We expect this will be a popular release, so it's worth joining the Lego Insiders program and grabbing the set ahead of time.

The 2,025-brick set lets you recreate a tiny slice of Willy Wonka's factory. Interactive elements include a moving chocolate waterfall and a secret door in Willy Wonka's office. The set also has nine minifgures including Willy Wonka, Charlie Bucket, Grandpa Joe, Augustus Gloop, Mike Teavee, two Oompa Loompas, Veruca Salt, and Violet Beauregarde.

The completed set sprawls over 20 inches wide and 10 inches deep, so make sure you have space reserved for your masterpiece. While this is designed as a Lego set for adults, kids can still have some fun with the completed set, thanks to all the minifigures--allowing them to play out their own unique scenarios.For those who haven't joined the Lego Insider program yet, it's Lego's free rewards program. Members earn points on all purchases that they can save up and use for additional discounts and other special offers. You get other perks throughout the year, such as free and discounted bonus sets when you order online. For example, Lego Insiders can currently get a free Sega Genesis Controller set when they spend $130 or more on qualifying sets until September 17.
