See at Walmart
If you're lucky, you can snag a pair of Nintendo Switch Joy-Con Controllers for only $39 at Walmart. This absolutely wild deal isn't available in all regions across the US. If you're eligible for the deal, you can click that magical "Add to cart" button and complete your purchase like normal.We would not be surprised if Walmart updates the price soon. Unless the retailer is trying to clear this particular Joy-Con model from its inventory, the massive price cut may have been a mistake.

Along with the vibrant Neon Purple and Neon Orange controllers, the 2-pack comes with Nintendo's Joy-Con Attachment sets. The removable wrist straps are recommended when playing games with motion controls. They are also useful for games that support single Joy-Con controls, as the attachments include larger shoulder buttons.Original Switch Joy-Con cannot be used in handheld mode on Switch 2, but you can still play wirelessly in docked or tabletop modes with the first-gen Joy-Con.At $80-$90, we definitely wouldn't recommend buying original Switch Joy-Con Controllers specifically for Switch 2, but for $39? You could do a lot worse.You'll probably want to buy a grip, so you can turn the pair of controllers into a traditional gamepad. Walmart has the officially licensed Joy-Con Comfort Grip for $11.49.

Unsurprisingly, Walmart's $39 deal is an all-time low for Switch Joy-Con Controllers at a major retailer. The deal comes on the heels of Nintendo raising the price on original Joy-Con 2-packs to $90, so you're technically saving $51 compared to Nintendo's official price.Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Con Controllers now cost $100, an increase of five bucks compared to the $95 launch price. That said, Amazon still has Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Con sets for $95 as of August 29.
