The Cosmic Shake is the better (and newer) of the two games, and it earned solid marks from critics. Our Cosmic Shake review gave it a 7/10, thanks to its classic SpongeBob humor and enjoyable platforming segments. "Despite a few hiccups and disappointing aspects of The Cosmic Shake design, at its core it achieves its goals," writes GameSpot reviewer James Carr.The other game in the bundle, Battle for Bikini Bottom Rehydrated, earned similar reviews, giving nostalgic fans a massive version of the underwater town to roam around as SpongeBob, Patrick, and Sandy.SpongeBob SquarePants: BundleGallery
This new Switch physical edition bundle isn't the only way to get your SpongeBob fix. Fans can preorder the next SpongeBob game, Titans of the Tides, which puts you in the middle of a conflict between the Flying Dutchman and King Neptune. It launches for $40 on November 18 for Nintendo Switch 2, PS5, Xbox Series X, and PC. If you're playing on Xbox Series X or PS5, check out the digital Bikini Bottom Bundle that includes The Cosmic Shake, Titans of the Tide, and Battle for Bikini Bottom for $90.SpongeBob will also appear as a playable character in the upcoming Nicktoons Dice of Destiny family-friendly action-RPG adventure that sees up to three other players team up and hack and slash their way throughout a cross-over world featuring numerous fan-favorite Nicktoons. The game launches on September 30 for Switch, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. Physical console edition preorders are available for $50. There's also an $80 Collector's Edition available for $80 on PS5 and Switch that features the base game plus extra in-game content, a set of physical trading cards, a poster, a sticker sheet, and more.For something different, check out The Patrick Star Game or Krusty Cook-Off. The former sees the lovable starfish getting his very own physics-based adventure, while the latter has you cooking up delicious meals to serve hungry customers. It's radically different from the 3D platformers in the upcoming SpongeBob SquarePants: Bundle, so give it a look if you want something unique to help bide your time.SpongeBob Video GamesNickelodeon: All Star Brawl -- $21.49Nickelodeon: All Star Brawl 2 -- $17 ($20)Nickelodeon: Kart Racers 3: Slime Speedway -- $23Nicktoons Dice of Destiny -- $50 | Releases September 30Nicktoons Dice of Destiny: Collector's Edition (PS5) -- $80 | Releases September 30Nicktoons Dice of Destiny: Collector's Edition (Switch) -- $80 | Releases September 30SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom - RehydratedSwitch -- $31 ($33)PS4 -- $23 ($33)Xbox One -- $22.49 ($33)SpongeBob SquarePants: Bundle (Switch) -- $35 | Releases October 31SpongeBob SquarePants: Krusty Cook-Off Extra Krusty Edition -- $20SpongeBob SquarePants: Cosmic Shake -- $20SpongeBob SquarePants: The Patrick Star Game-- $18 ($40)SpongeBob SquarePants: Titans of the Tides -- $40 Releases November 18SpongeBob SquarePants: Titans of the Tides Ghostly Edition -- $90 Releases November 18Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter: More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals & Preorders
