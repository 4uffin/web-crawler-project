Battlefield Studios has reiterated that the plan for Battlefield 6's cosmetics is to remain "gritty" and "grounded" as opposed to embracing more wacky and weird skins that games like Call of Duty and Fortnite are known for.Technical director Christian Buhl and senior console combat designer Matthew Nickerson recently elaborated on these points in an interview with IGN. Asked to respond to Activision's recent announcement about how Black Ops 6's weird skins won't move to Black Ops 7, Buhl said, "I think we're really happy with where we are. We want to be a gritty, realistic shooter."

Buhl went on to say any game is free to "be whatever they want to be," saying Fortnite is a "pretty good" game with its "goofy" skins."So, I think where we end up is we're pretty happy with where we are. We are a gritty, grounded, realistic shooter. That's what we intend to be, and that's what the game is going to look like for a while," Buhl said.Buhl ending that comment with "for a while" is causing some Battlefield fans to panic and theorize that Battlefield 6 will launch without weird skins and then add them later. Evidence of non-traditional cosmetics have already leaked, after all, prompting some people to wonder about what comes next.Nickerson, for their part, said Battlefield Studios examines the competition and understands the competitive landscape that Battlefield 6 will join this October. However, Nickerson said, "We're really focused on what works for Battlefield at the end of the day. We're not chasing trends. We're not chasing other products."Nickerson said people can look at the Road to Battlefield 6 event in Battlefield 2042 to get a "taste" of the kinds of cosmetics that will come to Battlefield 6 down the road."Generally, I think, from a design perspective, we're doing us. We're staying in our lane, doing us at the end of the day," Nickerson said.Before this, Battlefield Studios specifically mentioned how Battlefield 6 aims to have "grounded" skins and purposefully avoid Nicki Minaj. Battlefield 6 launches on October 10 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.Battlefield 6 -- See 154 Explosive Screenshots From The Upcoming ShooterSee More
