Last week, Microsoft unveiled a trio of Special Edition Xbox Wireless Controllers for its new Breaker series. Releasing this week, the Breaker controllers are the first new models to hit stores since Microsoft raised prices on a slew of hardware and accessories. Special Edition Xbox Wireless Controllers now retail for $80, but Amazon is offering discounts on two of the Breaker editions. Xbox and PC players can pay the old $75 price for the Ice Breaker and Heart Breaker Special Editions.Xbox Breaker wireless controllersAside from the bold colors for each variant and textured grips, these are your typical Xbox controllers in form and function. This has been the default design since the Xbox Series X|S consoles were launched in late 2020, and they've stood the test of time thanks to several factors: comfortable ergonomics, durable inputs, and strong battery life. The other great thing about Xbox controllers is that they're extremely versatile, as you can pair them with your Xbox Series X|S or Xbox One consoles, PC, Android, and iOS devices. Thanks to Bluetooth connectivity, linking them to compatible hardware is relatively easy.

The Ice Breaker Xbox controller lives up to its name, as it sports a glacier-blue design and a frosted, translucent finish. This makes several parts of the controller look like fragmented crystals, and there are variations of blue found across the thumbsticks, ABXY buttons, and textured grips.
