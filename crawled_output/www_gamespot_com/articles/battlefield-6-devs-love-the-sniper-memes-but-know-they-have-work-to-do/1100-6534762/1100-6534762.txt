Between now and the launch of Battlefield 6 next month, Battlefield Studios and its developers will be working to refine the game based on what was learned during the recent beta test. Players have already shared their responses to the beta with some bitingly funny memes, including some about the game's sniper flare. The Battlefield 6 team has seen those pics, and they think they're hilarious.Posts from the battlefield community on Reddit
Battlefield 6 technical director Christian Buhl and senior console combat designer Matthew Nickerson recently spoke with IGN about the upcoming release. When asked about the memes, Buhl admitted to laughing at them while also taking their points to heart."I saw those ... I thought it was hilarious," said Buhl. "Obviously, we needed to fix some things and tune some things, so it was funny to see players react in a humorous way to those things, but also great to get that feedback and say, 'We need to tune down snipers or we need to change the glints so it's not like…' you know? I saw those memes with the hillside just full of these giant glares."Nickerson added that the design team shares the memes internally, and he praised the effort made by fans to address the issues of the game through humor."They're really, really funny, and they kind of magnify, 'Hey, we still have work to do,'" said Nickerson. "For example, with the sniper glint stuff, we knew it was too strong, so we stepped it back. We knew the bullet tracer effect was too strong, so we stepped it back ... At the end of the day, it keeps us honest. It keeps us, like, 'Hey, we still have work to do. There are things that players are, maybe, not vibing with or are vibing with in different capacities.' ... From a design standpoint and from the team, we love this stuff. The community is engaged; we are engaged."In the same interview, Nickerson addressed the team's approach to open class weapons and locked weapons, and shared the team's desire to let the players decide. A recently leaked Battlefield 6 skin had some players revolting against the non-traditional design that may be out of place in the game's realistic military aesthetics. Battlefield Studios subsequently confirmed that its skins and cosmetics will remain "gritty" and "grounded."EA will reveal the details about Battlefield 6's story mode on September 26. The game's battle royale mode was unveiled earlier this month. Battlefield 6 will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on October 10.
