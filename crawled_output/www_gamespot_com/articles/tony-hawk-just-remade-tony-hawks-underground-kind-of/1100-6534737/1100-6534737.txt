Tony Hawk's Underground just got a (very short) remake, but not in the way that you were thinking. On social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok, skateboarding legend Tony Hawk posted the intro clip for the game, but this time, he stood in for the player-created main character as he interacted with the greatest villain in video games, Eric Sparrow.So what was the occasion? According to Hawk in the text for the video, this was his way of spreading a little joy and celebrating National Video Games Day. The video also had a "not a THUG promo" in its title, dashing any hopes for a remaster.

While the video is a fun reminder of THUG, don't expect it to be a teaser for an eventual remake of the cult-classic skateboarding game from 2003. Hawk himself has said in the past that he'd love to see it remastered, but ultimately, it's not up to him to make that call.The skateboarding icon still plans to campaign heavily for the game to get a new lease on life, and he's hoping that the success of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 will convince Microsoft and Activision to consider the future of the franchise.This year has been pretty great for skateboarding fans, as not only have the classic Tony Hawk games kickflipped onto console and PC, but the early access launch of EA's Skate revival is also on the way. Launching on September 16 for PC, PlayStation, and Xbox players the free-to-play live-service game features a redesigned Flick-it system and a vast metropolitan area to explore in style.The Biggest Game Releases Of September 2025See More
