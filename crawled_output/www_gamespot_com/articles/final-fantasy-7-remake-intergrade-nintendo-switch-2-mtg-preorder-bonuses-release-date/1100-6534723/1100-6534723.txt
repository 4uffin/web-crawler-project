As mentioned, the physical edition for Switch 2 also comes with a Magic: The Gathering Play Booster containing 14 cards from the exceedingly popular Final Fantasy crossover set. The physical edition also has reversible cover art: One side features Cloud and Sephiroth, while the other shows Cloud looking at the Shinra building.Like other Square Enix games for Switch 2, Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade is a Game-Key Card, so you will need to download the file from the eShop after inserting the card. In this case, though, Square likely didn't have a choice. The Switch 2 uses 64GB game cards, and FF7 Remake Intergrade is currently listed at 87.9GB--the largest Switch 2 game yet.If you don't already own a microSD Express Card, you may want to buy one ahead of time, because many players won't have enough space on the Switch 2's 256GB SSD to download the game. We've highlighted two microSD Express Card options below.

The officially licensed Samsung 256GB microSD Express Card is back in stock at Amazon for $59. To triple your storage space, check out the SanDisk Gameplay 512GB microSD Express Card for $78 at Walmart. It's substantially cheaper than most 512GB microSD Express Cards.
