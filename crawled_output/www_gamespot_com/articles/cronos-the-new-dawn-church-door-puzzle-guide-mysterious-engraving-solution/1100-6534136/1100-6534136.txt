If you've come to a church door late in your journey through Cronos: The New Dawn, you may be feeling a bit stuck on how to proceed. Unlike many of the other puzzles in the game, this one requires you to actually find and place items in a very specific pattern to open the door. While you can get some clues from the mysterious engraving on the door, we can also provide you with the exact solution in this guide. Lastly, note that this is not the same puzzle as the chapel door, which is also found in the hospital, rather confusingly.How to open the church door in Cronos: The New DawnIf you approach the church door, you'll note that there are six statues. One statue is holding the Sickle, which can't be removed. Two others are holding a Cauldron and Shield. There are three empty statues, which means you'll need to find the remaining ornate items: a Child, a Sword, and a Trident.These three items are found as you work your way through this area of the game and can be returned to if overlooked on the first pass, so they're not permanently missable. They'll be clearly defined in specific spots along the main path. When you've found them all, you can return to the door to begin solving the puzzle.This engraving offers clues.If you take a look at the Mysterious Engraving on the church's door, you'll get some clues about where to place the items you've found. The engraving states that one row is forged in steel while the other fosters life, which provides further clarity on which side the items should go on. But if you just want the exact solution, we've got it for you below:Remove the Cauldron and ShieldPlace the Shield on the left statue closest to the doorPlace the Child on the middle left statuePlace the Cauldron on the bottom left statuePlace the Sword on the right statue closest to the doorPlace the Trident on the bottom right statueThe statues should look like they do in the photos below, and the door should open immediately.Gallery
Before you step through the door, we'd recommend heading back to the safe room nearby to save and prepare. Load up on ammo and healing items, as you'll be facing a boss inside the church proper--and she's no joke. But use any materials you have to make healing items rather than ammo, as the boss spawns enemies that will drop plenty of ammo throughout the fight, meaning your main goal is simply to survive the onslaught by keeping your health topped off.
