Florida Sets Its Lawsuit Sights On Porn GamesAttorney General James Uthmeier has filed two lawsuits against porn game distributors Aylo and Gethins Limited.By

Florida has set its lasers to "sue" as the Sunshine State moves to attack porn games and their distributors in court.As reported by the Tallahassee Democrat, Florida's attorney general James Uthmeier filed two separate lawsuits against Lustyheroes.com and the parent company of Nutaku.net and SpiceVids.com. The dual suits allege that these websites have violated HB 3, the state law that went into effect in January and forced explicit websites to verify the ages of Florida users.According to Uthmeier, all three websites have skirted the responsibility of ensuring that people visiting them are at least 18 years old. As such, he's serving them fresh lawsuits to ostensibly make examples out of them."Florida is committed to being the best place to raise children," Uthmeier said in a press release. "We passed strong legislation to keep kids from being exposed to harmful and toxic material, and instead of following it, these platforms ignored it. We are taking them to court to make sure they cannot continue bypassing Florida’s common sense safeguards."Gethins Limited is the distributor of Lustyheroes, while Aylo is the parent company behind Nutaku and SpiceVids (as well as Pornhub). Although Gethins Limited has yet to publicly comment on the lawsuit, Aylo said both Nutaku and SpiceVids have complied with the legislation since it went into effect earlier this year."We intend to vigorously defend against these allegations in court," Aylo told the Tallahassee Democrat. "These platforms are committed to ongoing compliance with applicable state laws. We look forward to presenting the facts through the appropriate legal process."This is the latest development in the ongoing battle against pornographic material by Republican lawmakers. If you're an explicit-material enjoyer--whether casual or otherwise--you may have seen age verification pop-ups when visiting these websites (depending on where you live in the US). GOP members are adamant that, to protect the kids, "graphic" and "harmful" material must be abated. But there are always ways to consume porn.
