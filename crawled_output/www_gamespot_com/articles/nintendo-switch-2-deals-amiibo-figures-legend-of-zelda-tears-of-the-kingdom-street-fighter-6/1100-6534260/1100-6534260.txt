The Legend of Zelda and Street Fighter 6 Amiibo figures that launched alongside the Nintendo Switch 2 are steeply discounted at Amazon and GameStop. All four Tears of the Kingdom Sages are on sale for $20 each, down from $30. The trio of Street Fighter 6 characters are also available for $20, but these are 50% discounts, since each one retails for an eye-watering $40. Fans can also snag the GameStop-exclusive Street Fighter 6 Amiibo Card Starter Set for $20 (was $40).At the time of writing, GameStop had all seven Zelda and Street Fighter Switch 2 Amiibo for $20 each, but Amazon only has four figures for this price: Tulin and Sidon from The Legend of Zelda and Luke and Jamie from Street Fighter. That said, we'd recommend checking the store pages for all seven figures, because Amazon's prices have changed a couple times already. It's likely Amazon will soon price match the other two Sages from Zelda.Nintendo Switch 2 Amiibo Deals at AmazonThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom AmiiboTulin -- $20 ($30)Sidon -- $20 ($30)Yunobo -- $30Riju -- $30Street Fighter 6 AmiiboLuke -- $20 ($40)Jamie -- $20 ($40)Kimberly -- Sold outNintendo Switch 2 Amiibo Nintendo Switch 2 Amiibo Deals at GameStopStreet Fighter 6 Amiibo Card Starter Set -- $20 ($40)The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom AmiiboTulin -- $20 ($30)Sidon -- $20 ($30)Yunobo -- $20 ($30)Riju -- $20 ($30)Street Fighter 6 AmiiboJamie -- $20 ($40)Luke -- $20 ($40)Kimberly -- $20 ($40)
Street Fighter 6 Amiibo Card Starter Set
$20 (was $40) | Exclusive to GameStop
See at GameStop
The $20 offers align with Nintendo's recently updated prices for Amiibo released prior to the Nintendo Switch 2's launch. For instance, Nintendo is reprinting the King K. Rool Amiibo, and you can preorder the Donkey Kong villain for $20 at Best Buy. You can pair original Donkey Kong big boss with the Donkey Kong & Pauline Amiibo, which released alongside Donkey Kong Bananza in July. Because the DK and Pauline figure is in the Nintendo Switch 2 line, it carries a $30 MSRP and has yet to be discounted at a major retailer.See Nintendo Switch 2 Amiibo at: Amazon | Walmart | Best Buy | Target | GameStopCheck out our gallery below for a closer look at all seven Nintendo Switch 2 Amiibo figures on sale right now.
Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - Tulin Amiibo
$20 (was $30)
One of the most popular supporting characters in recent Zelda history, the young Rito has unsurprisingly been a big hit as an Amiibo figure. Tulin wields his signature Great Eagle Bow.Aside from serving as a fun companion for your desk or game room, the Amiibo is compatible with Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom for cool in-game goodies, including exclusive fabric for the paraglider in Tears of the Kingdom.

Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - Yunobo Amiibo
$20 (was $30)
Even as an Amiibo, Yunobo is still confused to see you. Or maybe he's confused that he doesn't cost $30 right now. The lovable Goron is no longer wearing the mask that turned Goron City into an all-you-can-eat buffet of Marbled Rock Roast, but Yunobo will always be always be the president of YunoboCo in our hearts. As is tradition, Yunobo wields the historic Boulder Breaker hammer in one of his giant hands.The Yunobo Amiibo is compatible with Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, offering in-game extras and a special fabric for Link's glider in the latter.

Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - Sidon Amiibo
$20 (was $30)
Sidon's smile has become a meme, so it's only fitting the Saga of Water's Amiibo figure features his exceedingly white teeth. The dapper Zora prince wields the Lightscale Trident passed down from Mipha. He's also adorned with a bunch of flashy jewelry you'd expect as the son of royalty. Like the other Zelda Amiibo, this one is compatible with Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom.

Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - Riju Amiibo
$20 (was $30)

Just like in the game, Riju wears traditional Gerudo attire, including a breezy skirt, ornate gold headpiece, bracelets, and more jewelry.Once again, you'll get some functionality with Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, unlocking in-game like special paraglider fabric.
