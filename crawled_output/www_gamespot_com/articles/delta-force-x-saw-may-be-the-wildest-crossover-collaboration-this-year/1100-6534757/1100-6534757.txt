There have been some off-the-wall year collaborations in the past year, including the Beavis and Butt-Head skins in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. However, developer Team Jade may have the wildest one of the year with the upcoming Delta Force x Saw crossover. In the teaser video, Saw's Jigsaw killer seemingly enters the world of this free-to-play first-person tactical shooter with a life or death ultimatum. In the Saw films, the original Jigsaw killer, John Kramer, has been dead for almost two decades. And neither he nor his successors wore life-sized costumes based on Billy the Puppet. But the man behind Billy's mask in this clip certainly knows Kramer's modus operandi and his favorite catchphrases. It's only at the end of the video that he reveals himself as operator D-Wolf. This isn't the first time that Saw has crossed over into games, as Billy appeared in Fortnite and Call of Duty.D-Wolf's Billy the Puppet skin will make its in-game debut on October 23--just in time for Halloween--alongside firearms and other items inspired by the Saw films. In the meantime, a new Delta Force season, War Ablaze, will begin on September 23. On that date, the game will introduce two new modes, Operation Warden and Operation Raven, as well as a new Warfare map called Fault. Additionally, a new operator, Raptor, will be added to the game's roster.Last month, Delta Force reached a new peak of concurrent players on Steam with 210,000. The game has steadily built up a following since its debut in December 2024. However, it appears that Delta Force is far more popular internationally than it is domestically, since it doesn't regularly show up in Circana's US engagement reports.As for the Saw movies, a new collection of Saw 4K Steelbook Editions are available for preorder on Amazon. Earlier this summer, Blumhouse picked up a controlling stake in the Saw franchise, which will bring the original director, James Wan, back in a creative role for the first time since Saw 3 in 2006.
