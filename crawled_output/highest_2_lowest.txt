Donald Clarke
Irish Times
The old-bloke attempts to engage with the contemporary music scene border on the embarrassing. Some of the casting is unfortunate. The film is never boring, but, once that delightful opening winds down, the action clunks where it should purr.
Rated: 2/5

Financial Times
With Washington the centre of everything, the flow of scenes feels like tracks on a solo album — this one strutting, this one sombre, this one a rap battle.
Rated: 3/5

Highest 2 Lowest may not rank as one of Lee’s best. But without him, the world of cinema would be a poorer place.

Algo Más Que Cine
Spike Lee’s remake of Kurosawa’s High and Low is ambitious, uneven, yet vital. Denzel Washington anchors a gripping moral dilemma, while Lee infuses it with New York’s pulse and sharp racial commentary. Imperfect, but powerful and necessary.
Rated: 6/10

Highest 2 Lowest is a worthwhile riff on a tried-and-true story that reminds me why I’m always interested in whatever Spike Lee is doing.
