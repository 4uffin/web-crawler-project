Read MoreFeaturing appearances by Wynton Marsalis, Kathryn Hahn, Lewis Black, Denyce Graves Montgomery, Misty Copeland, Otis Moss III, Kwame Alexander, and many more, "Chautauqua at 150: Wynton Marsalis’ All Rise" artistically looks at the evolution of ongoing cultural issues, and the impact that Chautauqua Institution has had in providing a critical platform for some of the most thought-provoking, challenging, and often uplifting conversations in America and beyond.
As part of this inspiring story of Chautauqua Institution, the documentary showcases legendary musician Wynton Marsalis and the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra, along with Chautauqua’s Music School Festival Orchestra (MSFO) and the Buffalo Philharmonic Chorus, performing Marsalis’s groundbreaking musical extravaganza “All Rise” in the famous Chautauqua Amphitheater during the 2024 Summer Assembly.
The musicians and performance are the embodiment of both the symphony “All Rise,” as well as Chautauqua Institution itself – a shared exploration of the American experience that illustrates how America is at its best when as a people, we celebrate our differences and rise up together to protect the foundation of this great nation – democracy.
