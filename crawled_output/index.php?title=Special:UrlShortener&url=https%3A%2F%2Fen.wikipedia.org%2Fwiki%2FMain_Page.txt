This account has been blocked from editing Wikipedia.This does not affect your ability to read Wikipedia pages.
The account 51.8.0.0/17 has been
blocked by ‪Blablubbs‬ for the following reason(s):
Why you are seeing this message: Your current IP address is blocked from editing Wikipedia because it appears to belong to a VPN or proxy service.
These types of services are commonly used for abusive editing and circumventing Wikipedia policies, so Wikipedia blocks them as a preventive measure — even if you personally haven't done anything wrong.
How to fix it:
Turn off VPNs, proxies, or tools like iCloud Private Relay (for Apple users) or Microsoft Edge Secure Network. This is the most frequent reason users encounter this block.
Try a different connection. Switch between Wi-Fi and mobile data, or use a home network instead of a public or work one.
Whitelist Wikipedia. You may be able to whitelist Wikipedia from your VPN so that connections to Wikipedia aren't through a VPN service. Instructions for whitelisting Wikipedia on iCloud Private Relay can be found here.
Still blocked? If you believe you are not running an anonymizing proxy or Tor, you should consider checking the configuration to make sure it is accurate. Sometimes the configuration for your network is changed without your knowledge, sometimes by malware. In truly exceptional circumstances, you may request IP block exemption. Approval is limited and based on specific criteria, and you should only request it if you have no other way to edit Wikipedia.
Note: These blocks are about the type of internet connection, not your actions. We appreciate good-faith contributors and want to help you get editing again.
How to appeal if you are confident that your connection does not use a colocation provider's IP address:
If you are confident that you are not using a web host, you may appeal this block by adding the following text on your talk page: {{unblock|reason=Caught by a colocation web host block but this host or IP is not a web host. My IP address is _______. Place any further information here. ~~~~}}. You must fill in the blank with your IP address for this block to be investigated. Your IP address can be determined here. Alternatively, if you wish to keep your IP address private you can use the unblock ticket request system. There are several reasons you might be editing using the IP address of a web host or colocation provider (such as if you are using VPN software or a business network); please use this method of appeal only if you think your IP address is in fact not a web host or colocation provider.
Information for administrators:
Administrators: The IP block exemption user right should only be applied to allow users to edit using web host in exceptional circumstances, and requests should usually be directed to the functionaries team via email. If you intend to give the IPBE user right, a CheckUser needs to take a look at the account. This can be requested most easily at SPI Quick Checkuser Requests. Unblocking an IP or IP range with this template is highly discouraged without at least contacting the blocking administrator.
This block will expire on 18:29, 20 October 2026.
Even when blocked, you will usually still be able to edit your user talk page, as well as email administrators and other editors.
For information on how to proceed, please read the FAQ for blocked users and the guideline on block appeals. The guide to appealing blocks may also be helpful.
