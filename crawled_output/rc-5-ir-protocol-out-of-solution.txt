RC-5 IR protocol, out of solution

This is my first post ! I recently bought a Cambridge Audio Azur 651A with no remote, I just want to make sure everything on the remote side works. It uses the Philips RC-5 protocol.
I wrote a very simple program for a PIC18F2550 with CCS C Compiler to control the amp.
This is my problem and I tried every solutions I could think of. Every even command (bit0 value 0) are working but all the odd command (bit0 value 1) are not ??
I inserted a printf to check with Putty if every 14 bits were send correctly and they were !
So I don't know what is the problem ?? This is my program:
#include <18F2550.h>
#device adc=10
#fuses HS
// High speed Osc (> 4Mhz for PCM/PCH)
#fuses NOWDT
// No watch dog timer
#fuses NOPROTECT
// Code not protected from reading
#fuses NOLVP
// No low voltage programming
#fuses NODEBUG
// No debug mode for ICD
#fuses CPUDIV1
// No System Clock Postscaler
#fuses PUT
// Power Up Timer
#use delay(clock=20MHZ)
// 20 Mhz crystal
// Software UART, not using UART hardware pins.
// Can use any pins for xmit and rcv !!
//#use rs232(baud=57600, xmit=PIN_C6, rcv=PIN_C7, errors)
// Hardware UART, using UART hardware pins.
//#use rs232(baud=9600, UART1, ERRORS)
// PWM is on pin RC2
// IRLED = 1 (to turn PWM Off, set pin as input)
// IRLED = 0 (to turn PWM On, set pin as output)
// This is the only way for changing pin RC2 direction without
// affecting the other pins on PORTC.
#byte TRISC=getenv("SFR:TRISC")
#bit
IRLED=TRISC.2

Welcome to StachOverflow. Please take a tour and see How to Ask. Specifically: it is not clear what the actual specific problem is. Also - if you use a C compiler, you should remove the c++ tag and add c instead.

I removed all the comments at the top, it is up to you to provide a minimal reproducible example that is free of clutter. So showing the code for sending only one command would be enough. Have you ruled out any hardware issues? Is the led really sending infrared pulses? (Note your code is distincly "C" not C++)
