RC-5 IR protocol, out of solution

This is my first post ! I recently bought a Cambridge Audio Azur 651A with no remote, I just want to make sure everything on the remote side works. It uses the Philips RC-5 protocol.
I wrote a very simple program for a PIC18F2550 with CCS C Compiler to control the amp.
This is my problem and I tried every solutions I could think of. Every even command (bit0 value 0) are working but all the odd command (bit0 value 1) are not ??
I inserted a printf to check with Putty if every 14 bits were send correctly and they were !
So I don't know what is the problem ?? This is my program:
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//
//
//
PHILIPS RC-5 PROTOCOL
//
//
//
//
This program can reproduce with an IR led emitter, the code to
//
//
control any electronics that uses the RC-5 Protocol. Just send
//
//
the Address and Command you want.
//
//
//
//
Remember that you send the two start bits (Always 1), the toggle
//
//
bit, the MSB to LSB of the Address and then the MSB to LSB of the
//
//
Command.
//
//
//
//
The toggle bit is a bit that it maintains the same logic level as
//
//
long as a key is pressed continuously, but if a key is released and //
//
is pressed back again (the same or a different key), the toggle bit //
//
is inverted. If for example you press the button "1" and you keep
//
//
it pressed, the remote control sends the RC5 protocol with 114mSec
//
//
repetition interval, and all these repetitions have the same toggle //
//
bit (for example 1). Now suppose that you release the key and you
//
//
press the same or another button. The next series of packets will
//
//
be sent with the toggle bit inverted (0). The reason for this bit
//
//
is for the receiver to recognize the double-click from a long
//
//
press. If for example you press button 1 twice (to switch to
//
//
channel 11), the receiver will understand this from the toggle bit
//
//
that will appear inverted the second time.
//
//
//
//
Start, Inverted MSB of Command, Toggle, 5 bits of Address, Lower 6
//
//
bits of Command
//
//
//
//
//
//
Cambridge Audio Azur 651A exemple:
//
//
//
//
Address: 16 for Amp (5 bits)
Command: 4 for S5 (6 bits)
//
//
//
//

You get a range of about 8 feet with this setup
//
//
and more if you put a reflector on the led.

Welcome to StachOverflow. Please take a tour and see How to Ask. Specifically: it is not clear what the actual specific problem is. Also - if you use a C compiler, you should remove the c++ tag and add c instead.
