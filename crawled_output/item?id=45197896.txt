This appears to avoid one of the classic bugs with parser combinators (expensive backtracking and/or memory-use), but appears not to fix one of the other catastrophes.To be explicit: one of the "features" this advertises is equivalent to saying "if you stop compiling your code with `-Wall`, you don't have to deal with all those pesky warnings!"reply
