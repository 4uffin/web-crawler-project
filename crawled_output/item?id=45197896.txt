I parsed my language with it, it's fast and works well.Pressing rules are written in c++ directly, with templates.Although if you have no experience in parsing, the learning curve could be a bit steep.replyo11c 2 hours ago

This appears to avoid one of the classic bugs with parser combinators (expensive backtracking and/or memory-use), but appears not to fix one of the other catastrophes.To be explicit: one of the "features" this advertises is equivalent to saying "if you stop compiling your code with `-Wall`, you don't have to deal with all those pesky warnings!"replyjibal 32 minutes ago

You have an odd notion of "explicit". There's no need to be coy ... spell it out.replytempodox 5 minutes ago

Are you being deliberately mysterious?reply
