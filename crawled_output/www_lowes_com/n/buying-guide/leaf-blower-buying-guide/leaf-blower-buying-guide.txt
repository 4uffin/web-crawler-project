Whether you want a powerful gas leaf blower for large jobs, a lightweight corded blower for small jobs or the best cordless blower for low-maintenance power, weâll help you find the right model to keep your yard looking its best.Handheld, Walk-Behind and Backpack Leaf BlowersChoosing the best leaf blower for your yard starts with understanding your options. There are several types to choose from.Handheld gas, cordless and corded models are the most common types for the home landscape.

Models that convert to vacuum/mulchers collect the material through the chute or nozzle and grind it, simplifying disposal or creating mulch you can use around the landscape.

It doesnât use gas or require engine oil, so you wonât need to dispose of used oil. These models require less maintenance and are lighter and quieter than gasoline-powered models. Theyâre also easier to start, operate with less vibration and donât emit the fumes that a gas-powered machine does.A small leaf blower or sweeper model is easier to manage and can handle driveways, decks and patios. Larger, high-power electric models are good for yards up to a quarter of an acre in size.A cordless leaf blower is also known as a battery-powered leaf blower or simply a battery leaf blower. The battery power gives you great mobility. The best battery leaf blowers have high-voltage batteries that provide longer runtimes. Youâll need to periodically recharge batteries, so depending on the size of your yard, you may want to have a spare so you always have a fully-charged battery available. Most battery-powered models are handheld, but a backpack design gives you a powerful battery leaf blower thatâs easier to manage than a handheld machine.A corded leaf blower offers consistent power without the weight of a battery. And while it doesnât require you to recharge it, youâll need a suitable outdoor extension cord. The cord can restrict mobility, so these machines are often best for clearing small yards or areas near the house. Follow the device manufacturerâs specifications for a compatible extension cord and learn about power cord safety.

You need to mix the fuel yourself or purchase pre-mixed fuel.Four-cycle engines run on gasoline alone. They eliminate the need for mixing fuel, but theyâre heavier than two-cycle engines and require regular oil changes.Tackle more jobs with blowers with higher power ratings on the packaging: amps (A) on a corded blower, volts (V) on a cordless blower and cubic centimeters (cc) on a gasoline-powered blower.Simplified choke operation makes startup easier on a gasoline-powered blower.Brushless motors on cordless models are more efficient than brushed motors, offering better runtime and more power.Miles per hour (MPH) ratings measure the speed that air exits the unit and are another indication of the blowerâs power.Cubic feet per minute (CFM) ratings measure the volume of air the blower moves. Blowers with higher CFM ratings can move more material.Some vacuum-capable models include larger-diameter chutes or tubes, which help collect leaves.Shop Brushless Leaf BlowersShop Leaf Blower AccessoriesTipStates, cities and neighborhoods have different noise level restrictions.
