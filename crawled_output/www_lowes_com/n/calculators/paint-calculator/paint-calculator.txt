Like most do-it-yourself (DIY) projects, a lot of the hard work in painting is in the preparation. After choosing the right color and sheen, figuring out how much paint youâll need, taping and priming, painting is practically the easiest part of the job.
Choosing a Paint Color
Not sure where to start when choosing a paint color? We get it. There are so many options available that itâs often overwhelming. To simplify, we created a Paint Visualizer that allows you to upload an image, like a photo of your living room, and try out different paint colors in the space. We have hundreds of color options to look through from brands like ValsparÂ® and HGTV HomeÂ® by Sherwin-Williams.
Estimating Paint Amounts The easiest way to figure out how much paint youâll need for your project is to use our Paint Calculator. Measure the length, width and height of your room and count the number of doors and windows. If you have moulding in your home, make sure to include it to get the most accurate estimate.
Essential Paint Materials
Aside from paint and primer or paint with primer built-in, youâll need a variety of other supplies to get started. A few must-haves include drop cloths, paint buckets, painters tape, sandpaper and a ladder. For a comprehensive list of necessary tools and materials, read our how-to guide How to Paint a Room. This is a great resource if youâre simply painting walls. If youâre working on another paint project, like painting kitchen cabinets, check out our guide How to Prep and Paint Kitchen Cabinets. Need specialized paint instructions like spray paint tips? We also have a Spray Paint Basics guide. View all articles on DIY projects for more tips, buying guides and how-tos.
Other Types of Paint
In addition to interior and exterior latex paint, we carry a variety of other paints, including interior stains and finishes, polyurethane for furniture, and epoxy paint for jobs like coating garage floors.
