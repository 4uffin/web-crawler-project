Window Curtains and Blinds
Spruce Up Your Home With Window Treatments
Window treatments â such as window curtains and window shades â improve
a room's aesthetic value while providing privacy and security. Our selection
offers a variety of styles, sizes and features to choose from, including dining
room drapery, decorative kitchen curtains, bathroom blinds and themed curtains
for children's rooms. Whether youâre looking for tailor-made fabrics for
hard-to-fit windows, or you're budget conscious and looking for economical
blinds and shades, weâve got the right window treatments to help you create the
look you want.
Choosing and Installing Window Treatments
Window treatments are an investment. Before you start installing window curtains and shades in your home, you'll want to do some research to be sure you're purchasing the items that'll give you the look you want. Lowe's offers many resources in our inspiration library that'll help you get started. Whether you're new to decorating windows or just looking for different ideas, you'll find them in our Window Treatment Buying Guide and our Designer Tricks And Tips For Window Treatments. With help from Lowe's, your windows will look professionally designed.
Different Rooms Call for Different Treatments
It's important to choose the right window treatment for every room in
your home. In the bedroom, you want window curtains that encourage relaxation
and assure security. Sheers filter light, offer privacy and create a sense of
calm with their light and wavy shape. Is your sleep hampered by light pollution
from street and car lights? If so, you may want to consider purchasing room
darkening curtains or blackout curtains. In rooms that get a lot of foot
traffic â like living rooms, kitchens and bathrooms â you want durable
coverings that'll stand up to children, pets and guests. Attractive plantation
blinds and easy to install vertical and horizontal blinds can be a great
choice. With large and hard-to-reach windows, consider purchasing remote
control blinds.
Worried you won't create a sense of continuity in your home when using
different colored and patterned curtains? Choose the same or complementing hardware
like drapery rods, curtain rings or tiebacks. You'll easily create a cohesive
look.
Outdoor Window Treatments
Can you use window treatments outdoors? You sure can. With outdoor
shades, you can protect yourself and guests from strong sunlight, letting you
enjoy your outdoor living space longer. Use these shades in patios, porches,
gazebos and decks. Buy them in neutral browns, off-white, white and gray to
complement your outside dÃ©cor.
