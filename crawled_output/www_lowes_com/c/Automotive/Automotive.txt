For Low-Fuel Emergencies
Itâs always a good idea to keep spare gas cans in your vehicles. Take one with you on road trips, keep one on the job site or store it in your garage for the lawn mower or generator â you never know when you might need extra gas. Whether youâre transporting it or keeping it in reserve, make sure the gas can is easy to use and properly seals to prevent escaping fumes and spills. Shop for quality options that meet your fuel capacity needs, work with the equipment youâre using and have any safety features you may want for extra security.
