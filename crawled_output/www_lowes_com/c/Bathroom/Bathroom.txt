Dream Bathrooms Start With Loweâs
Whether you want a complete bathroom remodel or just need
creative bathroom ideas, weâve got you covered. Turn your bathroom into a relaxing space thatâs customized just for you with selections from brands you love â like TOTO bathroom commodes â a variety of shower doors and sink faucets, cabinet hardware, and more.
We Have What You Need
Breathe new life into your bathroom design with updated
bathroom dÃ©cor and luxury bathroom fixtures like vanities, shower doors, shower
tile, enclosures, toilets and more.
If youâre not in the market for a total bathroom renovation, updating the details can make an impact, too. For example, installing new bathroom hardware and other bathroom sets â which may include towel rods, towel
hooks, cabinet pulls, framed bathroom mirrors and more â can bring a new, cohesive look to your space. Adding rugs in bathrooms is another simple enhancement. Or you can swap out your bathroom vanity sink. Looking for bathroom space-saver ideas? Loweâs can help with over-the-toilet storage, medicine cabinets, shelving and other solutions.
Upgrade Your Shower Experience
Whether you find yourself longing for the ease of a walk-in
shower or the luxury of upgraded materials, Loweâs is here to help.
For inside the shower, we offer an array of shower floor
tile and shower wall tile. And to simplify the selection process, we feature
complete shower kits that include the shower pan, walls and a high-quality
glass enclosure.
Of course, youâll want to keep the improvements going
throughout the rest of your bathroom. Shop our bathroom floor tile and bathroom
wall tile to ensure you create a space that reflects your personal style. And
while youâre at it, you may want to consider a luxurious upgrade to heated tile
flooring.
More Functional Facilities
When it comes to making your bathroom experience more pleasant and practical, look to Loweâs. We carry a variety of toilets from different brands, including KOHLER toilets, American Standard toilets and TOTO toilets. If youâd like an option that can help improve personal hygiene, consider toilets with bidets. Shop TOTO bidets and options from other brands to find what you need. Donât forget to explore other offerings, like round and elongated toilets, to make your bathroom fit for you.
For travelers or those who need to accommodate in-home
health care, we also offer a selection of portable toilets to ensure facilities
are always available.
