Kitchen Cabinets and Countertops
Great cabinets and countertops are the foundation of your kitchen. Loweâs carries cabinets that are custom, semi-custom, ready to assemble, stock or fully assembled. Fix any issues with replacement cabinet doors or give your kitchen a new look with upgraded cabinet hardware. If youâre not sure what you want your kitchen cabinets to look like just yet, visit our color gallery and request cabinet samples to review at home. For a truly unique look you achieve yourself, consider unfinished cabinets that you can paint or stain as desired.Choose a countertop style that complements your cabinets. Design and buy custom countertops with help from Loweâs experts and review custom countertop samples of materials like granite, quartz, laminate or wood right at home. Bring your farmhouse kitchen together with a butcher block countertop in the wood finish you like best. For budget-friendly countertop options, consider laminate sheets that can be installed on top of your current countertops.
Kitchen Sinks and Faucets
Your sink is an important part of your kitchen that needs to meet your functional needs and mesh with your dÃ©cor. Loweâs has drop-in sinks for easy installation, under-mount sinks for less splashing on your countertops and workstation sinks for multi-tasking chefs who are low on space. If you need a smaller sink for your home bar or prep station, Loweâs has those, too. Find the right faucet for your sink, whether youâre looking for wall-mounted, touchless or pull-down fixtures. Make getting a glass of water or brewing a cup of tea a breeze with hot and cold water dispensers. For a professional touch, install a pot filler faucet over your stovetop.
Kitchen Appliances
Outfit your entire kitchen with kitchen appliance suites or select each one of your major appliances individually. Browse refrigerators, countertop microwaves, dishwashers and wall ovens. Create the perfect cooking environment for you with a great cooktop and range hood pairing. Choose from gas, electric, induction, downdraft or coil cooktops, depending on your preference. Search for the right range hood to match your cooktop based on size, or filter by type. Loweâs has wall-mounted, island, downdraft, insert and undercabinet range hoods to meet your needs.
Kitchenware and Organization Solutions
Once the foundations of your kitchen are complete, choose kitchenware and small appliances that suit your cooking preferences â and keep them organized. Find high-quality cooking pots, bakeware, cutlery, flatware,
serveware and tableware for experimenting in the kitchen and then setting a beautiful table. Try out new techniques with kitchen gadgets and small appliances like air fryers, slow cookers, pressure cookers or food processors.
Keep your kitchen clean and have easy access to all of your tools with a variety of organization options. Keep cabinets and drawers clutter-free with pull-out cabinet organizers, drawer organizers and spice racks. If you need to create more storage space, consider installing wire shelves, using freestanding shelving units, or incorporating bakers racks, pot racks or kitchen carts.
Kitchen Backsplash and Kitchen Floor Tile
There are many reasons to install a backsplash in your kitchen. A kitchen backsplash can protect the wall behind the range or sink from splashing water, grease and other liquids. It also can update and enhance the overall look of your kitchen, as well as making cleaning easier. At Loweâs, we have a wide selection of kitchen backsplashes in a variety of materials, finishes and types, including peel-and-stick kitchen backsplashes.When it comes to your kitchen floor, tile is a durable and stylish option thatâs easy to maintain. Itâs available in many sizes, and there are a variety of types to suit any dÃ©cor. Make your floors stand out with materials like ceramic, natural stone, brick or another option.If youâre not sure where to start with a kitchen build or remodel, reference our Kitchen Planning Guide or our articles about kitchen remodeling ideas and designs.
