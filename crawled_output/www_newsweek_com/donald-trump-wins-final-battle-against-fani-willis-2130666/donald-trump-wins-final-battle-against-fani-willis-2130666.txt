Georgia's Supreme Court declined to consider Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis's appeal of her removal from the case she brought against President Donald Trump in 2023.Willis was removed from the 2020 presidential election interference case in December by the Georgia Court of Appeals, citing an "appearance of impropriety" created by a romantic relationship between the district attorney and special prosecutor Nathan Wade.Willis hired Wade to lead the case.Why It MattersA grand jury indicted Trump and 18 others in August 2023 after prosecutors accused them of participating in a plot to attempt to overturn Trump's 2020 presidential election loss to Joe Biden in Georgia. Four people who were indicted have pleaded guilty.The Georgia Supreme Court decision means it will now be up to the Prosecuting Attorneys' Council to find another prosecutor to take the case.If the new prosecutor chooses to continue pursuing all charges, it is unlikely that Trump could be prosecuted as the sitting president.

What To KnowWillis asked the Georgia Supreme Court to review her removal from the election interference case in January. On Tuesday, the court declined 4-3 to hear the appeal. One judge didn't participate, and another was disqualified.Willis had asked the court to consider whether a lower appeals court was wrong to disqualify her "based solely upon an appearance of impropriety and absent a finding of an actual conflict of interest or forensic misconduct."Willis said she disagreed with the court's decision but would direct her office to make the case file and evidence available to the Prosecuting Attorneys' Council of Georgia.Trump said the ruling was "a great decision" and called Willis's prosecution "a rigged case to start off with."Arthur Aidala, an attorney for former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who was indicted by Willis, said he hopes the new prosecutor will drop the case entirely."We're cautiously optimistic that they will choose not to go forward," Aidala told reporters.What People Are SayingPresident Donald Trump told reporters: "What Fani Willis did to innocent people, patriots that love our country, what she did to them by indicting them and destroying them, she should be put in jail."Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, in a statement obtained by the Associated Press: "I hope that whoever is assigned to handle the case will have the courage to do what the evidence and the law demand."What Happens NextThe Prosecuting Attorneys' Council's executive director, Pete Skandalakis, said he will begin searching for a prosecutor to take over the case. Skandalakis said that once the new prosecutor is selected, it is "up to him or her what to do with the case."The prosecutor could choose to continue seeking all charges, pursue only some charges or dismiss the case.This article includes reporting by the Associated Press.Do you have a story that Newsweek should be covering?
