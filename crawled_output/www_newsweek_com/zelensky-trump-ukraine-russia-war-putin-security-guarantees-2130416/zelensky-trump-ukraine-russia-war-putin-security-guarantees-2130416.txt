Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he needs a "clear position" from U.S. President Donald Trump to end the Russian war in Ukraine.Newsweek contacted the White House by email outside business hours to seek comment.Why It MattersTrump has been trying to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine, but despite his efforts and several rounds of dialogue, talks between Moscow and Kyiv remain stalled with the Kremlin describing them as "on pause."While Russia is seeking territory, Ukraine is demanding security guarantees and Zelensky, in his latest comments, is suggesting progress is possible if Trump clearly sets out the U.S. stand.

What To Know"Before we end the war, I really want to have all the agreements in place," Zelensky told Sky News in an interview, referring to security guarantees for Ukraine, which are still under discussion among allies."I want to have a document that is supported by the U.S. and all European partners. This is very important."This is a very motivating thing for the Ukrainian military so that they realize we will end the war and we will be protected. And to make this happen, we need the clear position of President Trump."Zelensky also said Ukraine "should be able to buy any weapons, except the nuclear weapons of course, from the United States. Important weapons. Missiles, rockets, etc. For us, this is very important."He also called for "strong personal steps made by President Trump to stop [Russian President Vladimir] Putin," who Zelensky said should have paid more as a price for a summit with Trump in Alaska on August 15.The Ukrainian leader said the meeting allowed the Russian president to "escape from political isolation."Zelensky earlier spelled out what he said were the "three pillars" of security guarantees his country needed to deter Russian aggression under any peace deal.Speaking at a press briefing on August 29, Zelensky said the first pillar was maintaining the Ukrainian army at its current level of personnel and ensuring stable funding for weapons.The second would be a NATO-like guarantee in lieu of Ukraine's membership of the alliance and the third, sanctions against Russia to punish and deter it.Trump said on Sunday a sticking point in the bid for talks between Putin and Zelensky is the level of enmity between them. He also labeled Russia "the aggressor" in the war, having previously declined to condemn Moscow for the invasion.What People Are SayingVladimir Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said on September 15: "NATO is at war with Russia. This is obvious, and it does not require any additional evidence‚Ä¶NATO provides direct and indirect support to the Kyiv regime."President Donald Trump told reporters Sunday: "The hatred between Zelensky and Putin is unfathomable‚Ä¶they're incapable of talking to each other."I think I'm going to have to do all the talking," he added. "There'll be talks. Whether you call it a summit or just a get-together."What Happens NextWhile the Kremlin has shown no real interest in talks, Ukraine and its allies will hope that Trump can make good on threats to target Russian oil exports, especially if the Ukrainian military can make inroads on the sector with more strikes on energy infrastructure.Update 9/16/2025 4:15 a.m. ET: This story has been updated to include more information.
