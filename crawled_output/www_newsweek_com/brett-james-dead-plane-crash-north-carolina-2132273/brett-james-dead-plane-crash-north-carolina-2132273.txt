Artists Dierks Bentley said in post on Instagram: "Rest in peace pal. Total stud. Fellow aviator. One of the best singer-songwriters in our town....total legend.
I brought a couple of roughy sketched verse ideas of I Hold On to Brett after my dad died and he just did his thing. The chorus is all him. When I sing that song live, I'm always thinking of my dad, but I also think about that day we wrote it. He just got it, just lit into it. It was one of the first times we wrote and I decided to drop the most meaningful and necessary idea of a song I had on him, because I felt like God was telling me to do so. Our friendship and that song changed my life. Prayers for his family."A post shared by instagram
