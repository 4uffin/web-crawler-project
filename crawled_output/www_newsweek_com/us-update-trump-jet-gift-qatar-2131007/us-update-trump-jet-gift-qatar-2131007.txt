The U.S. Air Force has begun modifying a $400 million Qatari "gift" jet, potentially intended for presidential transport, according to Air and Space Forces Magazine.Four months after the donation, Qatar, home to the largest U.S. military base in the Middle East, was struck by Israeli attacks targeting senior Hamas officials, drawing renewed attention to Washington's Gulf relationships.Newsweek has contacted the Embassy of Qatar in the U.S. for comment.Why It MattersThe U.S. officially accepted a luxury Boeing 747 jet from Qatar in May, following President Donald Trump's high-profile visit to the country during his first overseas trip since his re-election, which also included visits to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.With potential future use as Air Force One, after Boeing fell behind schedule on the delivery of two new presidential aircraft, the move has sparked debate over ethics, costs and security.

What To KnowIt is unclear how the Pentagon plans to adapt the 13-year-old ex-Qatari jet and get it flying before the VC-25B program, the official next-generation Air Force One, and details of the contract have not been disclosed, an Air Force spokesperson told the magazine. The report noted that the official referred to the jet as "executive airlift" and not "presidential transport," suggesting requirements may differ.This may mean fewer security, communications or defensive systems.Trump has repeatedly made the case for accepting the jet amid delays to Boeing's Air Force One program."I see it as a normal thing that happens between allies," Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani, Qatar's prime minister, said in May.Amid bipartisan debates over the gifted jet, U.S. officials are also navigating broader strategic and diplomatic considerations with Qatar in the region.The American base at Al Udeid in Doha was the target of a barrage of retaliatory missiles fired by Iran in June, before Israel's strike last week, which Trump has condemned, despite supporting efforts to eliminate Hamas.Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with the Qatari emir and prime minister in Doha on Tuesday, emphasizing Washington's desire for Qatar to remain engaged in mediation efforts aimed at securing the release of Israeli hostages taken by Hamas on October 7, 2023, and ultimately disarming the group.

What People Are SayingA U.S. Air Force spokesperson told Air and Space Forces Magazine website on Monday: "As directed by the Secretary of War, the Air Force is modifying a Boeing 747 aircraft for Executive Airlift support. Details related to the contract are classified."U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters on Monday, commenting on conflict in Gaza: "Look, I think ultimately we would all prefer to see a negotiated end that leads to all the hostages being released, that leads to Hamas being disarmed and eliminated as a threat, and we think Qatar can play a very key role in that. So we're going there."What Happens NextWhen Trump leaves office, reports say the plane will transfer to his presidential library foundation, but it's unclear if he could continue using it personally.
