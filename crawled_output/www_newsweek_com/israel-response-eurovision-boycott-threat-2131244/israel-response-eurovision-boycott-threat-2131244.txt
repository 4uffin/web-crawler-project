Israel has responded after multiple countries threatened to boycott the Eurovision Song Contest over its involvement."There is no reason why Israel should not continue to play a meaningful role in this major cultural event, which must remain a celebration of music and creativity, and not become politicized," the Israeli public broadcaster Kan said in a statement shared with Newsweek.Why It MattersThe threats of a boycott over Israel's inclusion in the competition come in protest to Israel's war in Gaza.On October 7, 2023, the Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an attack on Israel, which killed 1,200 people and led to 251 being abducted. In response, Israel launched a mass counteroffensive in Gaza. As of September 2025, more than 64,000 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry.The International Association of Genocide Scholars (IAGS) has said that Israel's conduct in Gaza meets the legal definition of genocide under the 1948 United Nations Convention. Israel has condemned this declaration. The United Nations commission has said that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza‚Äîan accusation which has also been denied by Israel, describing the report as one-sided and biased.

What To KnowThe Eurovision Song Contest is an immensely popular annual event, drawing in 166 million people last year, which sees nations battle it out to see who has the best song.Despite the name, the competition is not limited to European countries, and Israel has competed multiple times since its debut in 1973. To participate, a country must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union and have a state broadcaster capable of hosting the competition. Kan is Israel's representative to the European Broadcasting Union, which organizes Eurovision.Israel's inclusion in the contest has previously proved controversial, with artists and politicians calling for Israel not to be allowed to compete prior to the 2025 installment of the contest.These calls have now escalated as five countries‚ÄîSpain, Iceland, Ireland, Slovenia, and the Netherlands‚Äîhave threatened to withdraw if Israel is allowed to compete.Israel is undeterred by these boycott calls and told Newsweek that Kan is preparing to select Israel's representative for next year's contest, which is set to be held in Austria.What People Are SayingA spokesperson for Kan, in a statement shared with Newsweek: "Israel has been participating in the Eurovision Song Contest for over 50 years. Since the establishment of the Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation, Kan, Israel has been one of the most successful participants in the Eurovision Song Contest."Over the past seven years, the artists and songs submitted by Kan have reached fifth place, third place, second place, and even first place. There is no reason why Israel should not continue to play a meaningful role in this major cultural event, which must remain a celebration of music and creativity, and not become politicized. Looking ahead, Kan is preparing to select Israel's representative for the Eurovision Song Contest 2026 in Austria."Martin Green, director of the Eurovision Song Contest, in a statement previously shared with Newsweek: "Broadcasters have until mid-December to confirm if they wish to take part in next year's event in Vienna. It is up to each Member to decide if they want to take part in the Contest and we would respect any decision broadcasters make."A statement previously shared to Newsweek via email by the Eurovision Song Contest Reference Group, the Contest's governing body read in part: "The Eurovision Song Contest Reference Group, meeting in Dubrovnik, has taken note of the concerns expressed by several broadcasters regarding the pending decision of the EBU and the General Assembly on Israeli participation in the next edition of the Eurovision Song Contest. It is the role of the Reference Group to enforce the rules of the Contest; however, the current circumstances go beyond its mandate."What Happens NextThe potential of five, if not more, countries not competing in the competition due to Israel's involvement may throw the contest into chaos.Update 9/17/25, 10:14 a.m. ET: This article was updated with additional information.
