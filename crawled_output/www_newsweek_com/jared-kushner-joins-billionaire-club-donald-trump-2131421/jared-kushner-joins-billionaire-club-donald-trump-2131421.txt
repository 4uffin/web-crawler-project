Jared Kushner, the son-in-law of President Donald Trump who served as a senior advisor in his first-term Cabinet, has recently joined the ranks of America's billionaire class, according to Forbes.This week, the business outlet estimated that his net worth now stands at just over $1 billion, up from $900 million in 2024. Forbes attributed this to real estate investments, "new funding from his Middle Eastern backers," as well as the recent success of Affinity Partners, the private equity firm Kushner founded in 2021.Newsweek has contacted Kushner via Affinity Partners through their website for comment.Why It MattersThe U.S. is home to 902 billionaires according to the most recent tally from Forbes, up from the 813 billionaires it counted in 2024. Despite this growth, what Forbes calls the "three-comma-club" remains an exclusive one.What To KnowAs Forbes reports, Kushner's journey to achieving billionaire status has been marked by a number of prescient investments and risky bets through Affinity Partners, which he founded shortly after leaving his White House position and continues to maintain complete ownership of.

Affinity has spent around $250 million purchasing a 10-percent stake in the Israeli financial services firm Phoenix, which Kushner called "the JPMorgan of Israel." Kushner told Forbes that the investment has already brought in a return of more than nine times the initial outlay.Kushner has been able to raise a total of $4.6 billion in funding for Affinity, according to Forbes, thanks in part to sizeable inputs from the Qatari sovereign wealth fund and Lunate, a subsidiary of the business empire of Tahnoun bin Zayed Al Nahyan, National Security Advisor for the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and brother to the current UAE president.Affinity is currently worth $215 million, up from $170 million last October. Kushner also holds a stake worth around $560 million in Kushner Companies, the real estate business founded by his father, Charles Kushner, whom Trump pardoned during his first term following a 2005 conviction for falsifying tax returns, witness tampering, and making false statements to the Federal Election Commission (FEC).Forbes also notes that the Florida home that Kushner shares with his wife, Ivanka Trump, has more than tripled in value since it was purchased in 2020.

Kushner has now joined the "three-comma-club" alongside his brother Josh, who boasts a net worth of $5.2 billion, as well as his father-in-law.President Trump's net worth was estimated at $4.3 billion last year, a figure that has soared to $7.3 billion in 2025 thanks in part to his recent cryptocurrency ventures, pushing him to number 201 in Forbes's latest annual rankings of the richest Americans.What People Are SayingJared Kushner, speaking to Forbes about the evolution of Affinity Partners, said: "When we started, we were trying to find our positioning in the space. But now we've established ourselves as a go-to partner."What Happens Next?Kushner said that his company Affinity has a number of deals in the pipeline, including plans to invest in an undisclosed Mexican infrastructure company, though he added that the plan has been delayed by President Trump's tariffs.
