Pakistan's defense minister, Khawaja Mohammad Asif, said his nation's nuclear weapons capabilities "will be made available" to Saudi Arabia under their new pact.The mutual defense agreement signed on Wednesday declares that an attack on one nation would be considered an attack on both.Its nuclear dimension raises the risk of a nuclear war in the Middle East at a time when the region is rocked by instability and conflict spanning Israel, Gaza, Iran, Lebanon, and Syria in particular.Israel is currently the only Middle Eastern state with its own arsenal of nuclear weapons, though it does not formally acknowledge this for strategic reasons.The nuclear move is seen by analysts as a signal to Israel.It comes after Israel's attack targeting Hamas leaders in Qatar last week killed six people and sparked new concerns among Gulf Arab nations about their safety amid the Israel-Hamas war that's devastated the Gaza Strip and set the region on edge.Newsweek reached out to the Israeli government's press office for comment.Pakistan Touts Nuclear Capabilities"Let me make one point clear about Pakistan's nuclear capability: That capability was established long ago when we conducted tests. Since then, we have forces trained for the battlefield," Asif told Geo TV on Thursday."What we have, and the capabilities we possess, will be made available to [Saudi Arabia] according to this agreement," he said.Pakistan is a major non-NATO ally of the United States. Saudi Arabia is a key partner of the U.S. in the Middle East. Newsweek has contacted the State Department for comment.According to the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, Pakistan is slowly modernizing its nuclear weapons stockpile of approximately 170 warheads.

Israel Silent on DealIsrael has not commented on the Saudi-Pakistan defense pact. Pakistan has long criticized Israel's treatment of Palestinians, but has not been directly involved in any war against the country.And while neither nation has diplomatic ties to Israel, American officials had sought to mediate a diplomatic recognition deal involving Saudi Arabia before the Palestinian militant group Hamas's October 7, 2023, attack on Israel that sparked the war.Saudi Arabia has angrily criticized Israel since its invasion of Gaza to remove the threat of Hamas, a conflict that has wrought widespread death and destruction for ordinary Palestinians caught in between. Over 65,000 Palestinians have been killed since Israel's invasion began, according to the Gaza Health Ministry."We have not named any country whose attack would automatically trigger a retaliatory response. Neither has Saudi Arabia named any country, nor have we," Asif said in the interview."This is an umbrella arrangement offered to one another by both sides: if there is aggression against either party‚Äîfrom any side‚Äîit will be jointly defended, and the aggression will be met with a response."Pakistan Built Nuclear Arsenal With Saudi HelpSaudi Arabia has long been linked to Pakistan's nuclear program, providing it with financial support to keep pursuing its development of atomic weapons while the country faced related U.S. sanctions for years.Pakistan developed its nuclear weapons program to counter India's. The two neighbors have fought multiple wars against each other, and again came close to open warfare after an attack on tourists in April in Indian-controlled Kashmir.India is believed to have an estimated 172 nuclear warheads, according to the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.Pakistan's Shaheen 3 ballistic missile, potentially able to carry nuclear warheads, has a maximum range of 2,750 kilometers (1,700 miles), making it capable of reaching Israel.This story includes reporting by The Associated Press.Update 9/19/25, 10:36 a.m. ET: This article was updated with additional information.
