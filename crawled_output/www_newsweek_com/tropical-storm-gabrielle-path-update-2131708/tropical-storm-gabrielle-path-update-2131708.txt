Tropical Storm Gabrielle is expected to strengthen over the Atlantic Ocean as it tracks west-northwestward, potentially becoming a hurricane within the next few days.The storm is not currently projected to make immediate landfall, but forecasters have warned that shifts in its path could have significant effects on parts of the Caribbean and the southeastern U.S.Newsweek has contacted the National Hurricane Center (NHC) via email for more information.Why It MattersGabrielle is the latest in a series of storms to form during what is forecast to be a hyperactive Atlantic hurricane season. The NHC has already issued multiple advisories and forecasts for the storm, which could affect travel, supply chains and emergency preparedness in the Caribbean and southeastern U.S. regions if its trajectory shifts.What To KnowAs of the NHC's 11 a.m. Atlantic Standard Time advisory on Wednesday, Gabrielle was located about 1,200 miles east of the Lesser Antilles with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph. The storm is moving west-northwest at 17 mph.The latest forecast graphics from the NHC show Gabrielle's projected path staying over open waters for at least the next three days. However, the storm's track is subject to change based on evolving weather patterns in the Atlantic basin.
A prediction for the path of Tropical Storm Gabrielle.

National Hurricane Center
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration previously warned of a heightened risk for major hurricanes in the Atlantic due to record-breaking sea surface temperatures and the ongoing transition from El Ni√±o to La Ni√±a conditions.The 2025 Atlantic hurricane season has already produced several named storms, with Gabrielle currently being the focus of meteorologists because of its potential for rapid intensification.No coastal warnings or watches are in effect. However, the center has advised that residents in the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico should remain alert for future updates.What People Are SayingAccuWeather lead hurricane expert Alex DaSilva previously told Newsweek: "While there will be a relative lull in tropical activity during the first few days of September, atmospheric conditions will become a lot more conducive for development later this week. As a result, we expect a greater uptick in activity starting around the end of the first week in September."Meteorologist Dylan Federico wrote on X on Sunday: "Conditions look favorable and I wouldn't be surprised if this becomes the next hurricane. The faster it develops the more likely it turns out to sea. Either way we have plenty of time to watch, as it's over 10 days away from the United States, if it ever even gets here. This is your friendly reminder that it's the peak of the hurricane season, and now is a good time to check your supplies and plan."What Happens NextThe hurricane center is deploying additional satellite monitoring to improve short-term forecast accuracy as Gabrielle progresses.If Gabrielle reaches hurricane status, it would be the fourth hurricane of the Atlantic season. Emergency management agencies across the Caribbean are beginning preliminary coordination, though no alerts have been issued as of Thursday morning.
