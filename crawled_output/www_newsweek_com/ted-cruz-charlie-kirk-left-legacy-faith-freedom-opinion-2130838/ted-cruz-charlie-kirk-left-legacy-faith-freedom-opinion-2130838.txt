Last week, a wife lost her husband.Last week, two children lost their father.Last week, many of us lost a dear friend.And last week, America lost one of its truest and most loyal patriots.I first met Charlie Kirk when he was just 18 years old, in my friend's living room. Fresh out of high school, even then, he had a vision for Turning Point USA‚Äîa dream to energize young people, inspire them, and get them involved. He started in his parents' garage, and that vision grew into something extraordinary.From the beginning, Charlie stood out. He was brilliant, bold, courageous, and joyful. He was a happy warrior.Like so many across the country, I struggled to comprehend the news of his death.He was assassinated for speaking the truth, for sharing his heartfelt beliefs, for daring to open conversations across the political spectrum. And his absence leaves a gaping hole in our nation's soul.It's painful to write about the death of someone whose life was taken too soon and so tragically.It's even more difficult to think of his beautiful wife, Erika, who has lost her husband, and of his two young children, who will never know their father. Charlie's family has suffered an incredible, incomprehensible injustice.But they will know his legacy. They will know his face and his words and his smile and his charm online. Charlie touched and changed millions of lives. He started a movement that fundamentally reshaped our country.

When I think back on Charlie's life and all that he accomplished by the age of 31, I'm struck by how profoundly he influenced our nation. He had a gift, and few have done more for America's youth.Yes, he encouraged young Americans to go to the polls. He engaged in open discussion. He wanted to know young people's hearts.But most importantly, he was good for our country because he wanted to revive the souls of Americans.Charlie wanted people to know the Lord, and he wanted to be remembered most for his courage in faith. He was one of the most important Christian evangelists and apologists of modern times.Charlie sought out those who disagreed with him, and he was happy to listen to their arguments‚Äîrespectfully and civilly‚Äîand to engage them on substance.And he made an unbelievable difference in the lives of young people, inspiring millions across America and across the world.

Newsweek Writers Debate: Was Charlie Kirk a Good Model for Civil Discourse?

Charlie dedicated his life and his work to training, educating, and organizing students to promote the principles of freedom and limited government. Turning Point USA hosted conferences, trained activists, and advocated for the rights enshrined in our Constitution. I have spoken at nearly a dozen Turning Point rallies, and every one was characterized by extraordinary energy, excitement, and passion for liberty and for America.What characterized Charlie was his willingness and eagerness to engage in conversation with people, regardless of their politics, and to engage people with compassion: by listening to them, understanding them, treating them with dignity and respect.But when you look at all of Charlie's qualities, the one that was most extraordinary was his love for Christ.His faith was real. It mattered to him. God, family, country‚Äîin that order, Charlie would say.That's a legacy. That's Charlie's extraordinary legacy.And it will not be forgotten.We now have the immense responsibility to continue it.To Charlie: you have left behind something remarkable.You have fought the good fight, you have finished the race, and you have kept the faith.On Wednesday, God welcomed Charlie, saying "well done, My good and faithful servant."Charlie, my friend, we are proud of you, and we miss you. I look forward to seeing you again one day.Ted Cruz is a U.S. Senator from Texas.The views expressed in this article are the writer's own.
