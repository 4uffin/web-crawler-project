In a series of votes on Friday, advisers to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) did not recommend this fall's COVID-19 vaccine to all Americans, but said people could make their own individual decisions instead.The panel advised individuals under 65 years old to consult with a doctor with "an emphasis that the risk-benefit of vaccination is most favorable for individuals who are at an increased risk for severe COVID-19 disease," NBC News reported.Why It MattersThe CDC's vaccine advisory panel shapes recommendations that influence state policies, insurance coverage and doctors' guidance to patients. CDC directors have historically adopted the panel's recommendations, which are closely followed nationwide.Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime vaccine skeptic before his appointment within the Trump administration, dismissed the panel's 17 previous members earlier this year and replaced them with a mix that includes anti-vaccine voices. That has fueled concern among public health experts that new votes could heighten confusion among parents and undermine trust in vaccines.The panel's debate on the COVID-19 shot follows Food and Drug Administration (FDA) restrictions on reserving the updated vaccines for older adults and high-risk groups. Previously, the COVID-19 vaccine was recommended as a routine step for nearly all Americans who wanted them, similar to the flu vaccine.From October 2024 to mid-September 2025, the CDC has estimated that there has been up to 530,000 COVID-19 hospitalizations and up to 61,000 deaths from the virus.

What To KnowThe panel on Friday also urged the CDC to adopt stronger language around claims of vaccine risks. Outside medical groups have said the COVID-19 shots had been proven safe from the billions of doses administered worldwide.The divided panel did not approve a measure to urge states to require a prescription for the shot. However, some states have taken steps to ensure access to the vaccine, including Arizona, Illinois, Maine and North Carolina.America's Health Insurance Plans, a group representing most health insurers, said earlier this week that its members will continue coverage of the shots through 2026.Dr. Sean O'Leary of the American Academy of Pediatrics told the Associated Press that the panel's meeting showed efforts to "sow distrust" about vaccines and would have "real-time impacts on American children."The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) also voted on Thursday to limit access to a measles-mumps-rubella vaccine known as MMRV. The panel also postponed a vote on whether all newborns should get the hepatitis B vaccine.What People Are SayingDr. Sean O'Leary of the American Academy of Pediatrics, in comments to the Associated Press: "It was a very, very strange meeting."Retsef Levi, a member of the ACIP and MIT professor of operations management, in comments to the panel: "I don't think that the public currently believes the narrative of safe and effective."Dr. Robert Hopkins Jr., the medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, said, per NBC News: "It's important to note that we continue to see severe disease from COVID-19, leading to hospitalizations and deaths. The impact is greatest in our population 75 and older but is also significant in our younger adults and also our youngest children."Dr. Fiona Havers, an infectious diseases physician and former medical epidemiologist at the CDC, said, per NBC News: "Any decrease in vaccination coverage in older adults will lead to more hospitalizations and death in this age group."What Happens Next?The panel's new guidance would need to be approved by acting CDC Director ‚Äã‚ÄãJim O'Neill.This article includes reporting by the Associated Press.Do you have a story that Newsweek should be covering?
