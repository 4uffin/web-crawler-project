Minecraft's Reddit community ranks among the least toxic in gaming discussion, according to a new analysis of major franchise subreddits.The study, conducted by video-game asset marketplace Chicks Gold, placed r/Minecraft second overall with an estimated 1.37% of comments per post containing selected toxic keywords.With 8,503,899 subscribers, it was also the largest community in the sample, suggesting that scale does not necessarily correlate with higher rates of hostile language.The ranking was produced by sampling 50 recent posts from each subreddit and scanning their comment threads for a fixed list of terms commonly associated with negativity. For each subreddit, researchers calculated the share of comments containing any of these terms and averaged the results to produce a toxicity percentage.

Across the top of the table, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion's subreddit, r/Oblivion, recorded the lowest average at 1.36% from its 1,015,373 subscribers, marginally ahead of Minecraft's 1.37%.The remainder of the top five comprised The Legend of Zelda and Genshin Impact (both 1.51%) and The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim (1.56%). Further down the list, Warframe (1.57%), No Man's Sky (1.60%), Red Dead Redemption (1.63%), Animal Crossing (1.75%), and RuneScape (1.84%) rounded out the ten least toxic communities identified by the methodology.Word-frequency snapshots differed slightly by franchise but often featured variants of "hate" among the most common flagged terms. In Minecraft's case, "hate," "worse," and "garbage" were the most frequently seen keywords within the study's toxic lexicon.While the focus was on communities with comparatively low toxicity, the researchers also noted that some high-profile franchises saw substantially higher levels of hate. For example, the subreddit linked to the FIFA football series was cited as among the most toxic measured, despite the game carrying an "E for Everyone" style rating in several markets.A spokesperson from Chicks Gold said the following: "Reddit is a great place to discuss topics such as gaming, and a place to share tips on playing tricky video games. Despite this, it can also be a place of toxicity, where users may discuss harmful subjects, or use toxic language."This study reveals that gaming communities are guilty of such toxicity. Surprisingly, the football game FIFA came out on top, which has an age rating of E (everyone), a game perceived to be appropriate for children to play."Although the game itself is deemed appropriate for children, the community that comes with it might not be. This suggests that parents may need to be more vigilant when allowing their children to play such video games, looking beyond just the content of the game."
