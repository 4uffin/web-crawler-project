Conservative commentator Scott Jennings denounced "left-wing radicalism" for motivating the young man who allegedly shot and killed Charlie Kirk last week, highlighting in a fiery television debate the struggle between conservatives and liberals to apportion blame for the murder.Why It MattersRepublicans and Democrats alike denounced the killing of conservative activist Kirk, 31, a staunch ally of President Donald Trump, at Utah Valley University on September 10 during a question-and-answer session with students.While authorities have not provided many details about why they think Tyler Robinson, 22, carried out the attack, the Trump administration has sought to characterize it as an assault on American and Christian values, leading to what the president said on Sunday was a "major investigation" into "people on the left."Trump's opponents have sought to play down conservatives' assertions that the suspected shooter was motivated by left-wing ideology.

What To KnowJennings, in a CNN panel discussion, suggested that the evidence pointing to a left-wing motivation for the killing was almost irrefutable."Guys, the evidence here is overwhelming," Jennings said.Citing various evidence including text messages between the accused gunman and his roommate, which prosecutors released on Tuesday, Jennings continued: "He said 'Charlie Kirk, I can't stand his hate any more, I'm going to take him out,' the testimony and statements from his family, he had become more left-wing, he etched the statements that are made by the left about Republicans and conservatives and 'Charlie Kirk fascists' on the bullet casings."Some analysts have questioned whether the slogans on bullet casings that police retrieved after the shooting suggest ties to anti-fascist or left-leaning groups, or whether they were intended as references to internet culture.Robinson, who comes from a Republican family, was charged on Tuesday with seven crimes, including capital murder, obstruction of justice, and tampering with a witness. Jennings derided what he said was a failed attempt by liberals to question whether the shooter was motivated by leftist ideology."The evidence has now come out, he was motivated by hate, he was motivated by left-wing radicalism, he got mixed up with some trans ideology in his life," Jennings said, referring to a statement from Utah Governor Spencer Cox that Robinson's roommate, Lance Twiggs, is a transgender individual."We're looking around the edges of this for something other than what's staring us in the face: left-wing radicalism got this kid, he went up to a roof and he murdered our friend, and that's what happened," Jennings said.But another member of the CNN panel, long-time television host Montel Williams, questioned Jennings' insistence that the motive for Kirk's killing was political."I don't believe he was motivated politically. I think this was motivated emotionally. I think this was an emotionally stunted person who literally‚Ä¶tried to defend his significant other, not trying to defend some ideology," Williams said, referring to the reported relationship between Robinson and his roommate and Kirk's well-known stand against transgender rights.What People are SayingPresident Donald Trump told reporters on Sunday: "If you look at the problem, the problem is on the left. It's not on the right‚Ä¶and when you look at the agitators, you look at the scum that speaks so badly of our country, the American flag burnings all over the place, that's the left, that's not the right."Montel Williams said of the accused: "This is probably his first real relationship. And somebody was disparaging the person that he loved. He sat on that building for 30 minutes before he took the shot. Why do you wait until the first word trans came up? Then he took the shot."What Happens NextA memorial service for Kirk will be held on Sunday at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. Among those due to speak are his widow, Erika Kirk, Trump, Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard.
