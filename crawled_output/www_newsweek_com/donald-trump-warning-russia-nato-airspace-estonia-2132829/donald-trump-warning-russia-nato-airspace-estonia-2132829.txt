President Donald Trump warned of "big trouble" when asked Friday about the reports of Russian fighter jets entering Estonia's airspace.The president responded, "Well, I'm gonna have to look at it. They'll be briefing me in a short while, so I'll let you know about it tonight or tomorrow.He continued, "I don't love it. I don't like when that happens. This could be big trouble, but I'll let you know later they're going to brief me in about an hour."The Estonia incident happened just over a week after NATO planes downed Russian drones over Poland and heightened fears that the war in Ukraine could spill over.Q: Russian jets entered Estonia's airspace today for 12 minutes. Do you see that as a threat to NATO?TRUMP: Well, I'm gonna have to look at it. They'll be briefing me in a short while. pic.twitter.com/K4HnvfY8IT‚Äî Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) September 19, 2025
Did NATO Intercept Russian Jets?On Friday, NATO scrambled Italian F-35 jets under its Baltic Air Policing Mission to intercept three Russian MiG-31 fighter aircraft that entered Estonia's airspace without permission. The jets reportedly flew without a flight plan, had their transponders turned off, and stayed inside Estonian airspace for about 12 minutes before being escorted out.Later in the day, Sweden's military posted photos of what it says were Russian fighter jets over the Baltic Sea.The post said, "Following a violation of Estonian air space, Swedish JAS 39 fighters intercepted and monitored three Russian MiG-31 fighter jets over the Baltic Sea today. Sweden is always ready to ensure the safety, security and integrity of our airspace together with our allies."Meanwhile, Poland accused Russia on Friday of violating the "safety zone" of a Baltic Sea oil platform after two fighter jets flew low over the Petrobaltic installation. The Polish Border Force said the military and other authorities were alerted following the incident, which it called a breach of security around the offshore site.What is NATO's Article 4?Article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty allows any NATO member to request consultations among the alliance if it believes its territorial integrity, political independence, or security is threatened. It's a mechanism for political dialogue and coordination, not a guarantee of military action, but it often precedes heightened alert or joint responses.
Sweden‚Äôs military on Friday released photos it said show a Russian fighter jet that entered Estonian airspace, taken over the Baltic Sea after the plane exited Estonian territory.

When was NATO's Article 4 last invoked?NATO's Article 4 was most recently invoked by Poland on Sept. 10, 2025, after multiple Russian drones violated Polish airspace. Earlier, several Eastern European states simultaneously invoked it on Feb. 24, 2022, in response to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.How Many Soldiers Has Russia Lost in Ukraine?Estimates of Russia's losses in the war with Ukraine vary, but most credible sources suggest they have suffered over 900,000 casualties (killed, wounded, missing, or captured), with fatalities likely in the hundreds of thousands. These numbers are based on Ukrainian official figures and Western intelligence.Following a violation of Estonian air space, Swedish JAS 39 fighters intercepted and monitored three Russian MiG-31 fighter jets over the Baltic Sea today.
