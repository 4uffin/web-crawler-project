New Jersey is creating a stand-alone Department of Veterans Affairs, separating it from military operations in a move aimed at improving oversight of services for veterans and their families.Why It MattersThe law will split the current Department of Military and Veterans Affairs into two agencies. The change comes after significant failures at Veteran's homes across the Garden State during the coronavirus pandemic.What To KnowThe renamed Department of Military Affairs will continue to oversee military functions, while the new Department of Veterans Affairs will focus solely on housing, health care, mental health services, and benefits for veterans.The reorganization does not create new programs or require additional funding, according to a new release from Governor Phil Murphy's office.Governor Murphy has nominated Vincent Solomeno, the current deputy of the Department of Military and Veteran Affairs, to be commissioner of the new agency.

The shake-up follows criticism over the state's handling of care at veterans homes.Nearly 200 residents died in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a U.S. Department of Justice report finding the state failed to "implement basic infection control protocols and provide adequate medical care to the Veterans Homes' residents" and that a "systemic inability to implement clinical care policy, poor communication between management and staff, and a failure to ensure basic staff competency let the virus spread virtually unchecked throughout the facilities."The state has since paid out millions in legal settlements.The news release from Murphy's office does not mention that the changes are linked to the pandemic-era failures.What People Are SayingGovernor Murphy said: "Veterans have selflessly fought for our hard-earned freedoms as Americans. By establishing a department solely dedicated to the needs of veterans, we will continue to ensure they have a seat at the table and direct access to the support and resources they deserve. Our veterans and their families deserve nothing less.""Vincent Solomeno has dedicated his career to serving our veterans and their families. His years of leadership and experience will help support our service members effectively. I am confident he will excel as the inaugural Commissioner of the Department of Veterans Affairs."Vincent Solomeno said: "Under Governor's Murphy's leadership, the State of New Jersey continues to invest more, do more, and achieve more for Garden State veterans than at any time in our history. I am privileged to work beside teams of dedicated public servants. We are committed to building a robust cabinet-level Department of Veterans Affairs worthy of those that we serve."What Happens NextThe law will take effect in early January 2026.
