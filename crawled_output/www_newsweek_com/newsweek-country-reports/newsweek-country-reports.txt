pillars of the greenPillars of the Green TransitionThere has hardly ever been a more ambitious undertaking than the global fight against climate change. This is a task requiring an unusual kind of deftness - an ingenuity which must go beyond the carefully crafted strategies of individuals or even countries. Effectively tackling climate change means that the interactions between all social entities, from international organizations and states, down to local communities, corporations, and individual consumers, must be oriented towards the same goal. There is no better way of achieving that than by transforming the way we think about climate change - from a costly obligation, a homework inviting procrastination, to an opportunity for the generation of prosperity. United by this optimistic mindset, our interlocutors testify to the richness of possible approaches to the creation of the green economy of the future - remarkably, both competition and collaboration are lauded, these not being mutually exclusive in a world with the right guiding lights and incentives are set in place. And this is where governments must clearly step in: not as volubile central planners, but as direction-pointers, consensus-establishers, traffic cops of sorts, whose fundamental role is to set the rules of the game.Based on conversations with over 100 different industry leaders and policymakers, this report, with its special COP 28 distribution, presents the reader with a unique overview of the global fight against climate change. Focusing on the opportunities also means highlighting the challenges, so that private and public actors alike can get valuable information and, hopefully, transform the latter into the former. While not claiming exclusivity, this piece zooms in on the key pillars of the green transition: finance, green energy, transportation, circularity, and the built environment.Read More

miningThe New Era of MiningA robust global mining industry is essential for a growing green economy. Some facts to bear in mind: a solar panel requires aluminum, steel, copper, zinc, and silver. A wind turbine: steel, copper, and aluminum. An EV battery: lithium, gold, silver, cobalt, manganese, aluminum, nickel, and copper. These raw materials are now commonly known as the critical metals. As per the World Bank, these could experience a fivefold increase in demand by 2050, driven by the growing requirements of clean energy technologies. The supply shock has already prompted new political legislation in the U.S., Canada and Europe, and the security of domestic supply will be a major talking point in the 2024 presidential election. In this context, considering recent geopolitical events such as the war in the Ukraine and the deteriorating relationship between the West and China, security of supply is a central concern of the West.To meet the needs of the modern world, an estimated $1.7 trillion in global mining investment is anticipated. This upheaval in demand has consequenced a radical shift in the industry: not simply to ramp up extraction, but also to enhance the processes which make the industry more sustainable. In this report, we present the essential facts and figures of this New Era of Mining, and set out the main political and structural challenges ahead. The insights showcased here are based on over 100 in-depth interviews with the mining CEOs leading the industry forward today. Read More
