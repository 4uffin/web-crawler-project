Why It MattersOne clip of the moment was viewed 3.1 million times and liked 7.2k times after it was posted on X by a supporter of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle with the message: "Ok you can go now, the grown ups need to talk üòÇ Cammy is no joke üòÇüòÇüòÇ."Royal engagements can be high-pressure moments and it is not possible to know what was going through either Camilla or Kate's mind at the time.However, social media users appeared to read some conflict into the body language between the pair, whether accurately or not.Ok you can go now, the grown ups need to talk üòÇ Cammy is no joke üòÇüòÇüòÇ pic.twitter.com/g9jaMqrdvx‚Äî SK üíÉüèæüï∫ (@Rimmesfk) September 17, 2025
