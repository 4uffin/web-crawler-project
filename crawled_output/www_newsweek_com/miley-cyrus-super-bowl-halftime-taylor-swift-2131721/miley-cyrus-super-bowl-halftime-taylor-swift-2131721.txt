The post reads, "Apple Music seems to be teasing that Miley Cyrus will headline the 2026 #SuperBowl Halftime Show."@transleytanked responded to their own post, in a reply viewed over 340,000 times. That reply read, "Flowers (Instrumental) Flowers (Sped Up) Flowers (Acapella) Flowers (Reverb & Slowed) Flowers (Nightcore) Party in the usa party in the usa (8D Audio) Flowers (Piano Version) Flowers (trans version) Flowers (Orchestral) Flowers (Lo-Fi Remix)."The post has the wrong numerals, reading "Super Bowl LVII," not "Super Bowl LX."The post is unverified, does not appear to have any affiliation with Apple and is likely to be a joke or fan edit from the fan account.Cyrus' name has been mentioned multiple times over the years as a potential Super Bowl halftime performer.According to Betting Odds from Gambling.com, the current favorite to perform at the Super Bowl halftime show is Taylor Swift, with a probability of 44.4 percent.She is followed by Jay-Z, with a probability of 40 percent and Dua Lipa with a probability of 38.1 percent. Other artists on the list include Drake (34.8 percent), Post Malone (33.3 percent), BTS (28.6 percent), Miley Cyrus (25 percent), Ed Sheeran (22.2 percent), Billie Eilish (20 percent), Metallica (18.2 percent), Olivia Rodrigo, (16.7 percent), Justin Bieber, (15.4 percent), Mariah Carey, (14.3 percent), Lady Gaga, (11.1 percent), Green Day, (9.1 percent).Speculation that Swift will be the next Super Bowl halftime performer has been rife since she appeared on the New Heights, the podcast co-hosted by her fiance, Travis Kelce, and announced her highly anticipated 12th studio album, The Life of a Showgirl.Eagle-eyed Swifties spotted a few Easter eggs during the podcast that they think mean Swift will perform at the Super Bowl.What People Are SayingJessica Benson, a reporter who covers pop culture and sport, in a reel shared by Grind City Media viewed over 16 million times, "I think Taylor Swift is going to be the Super Bowl halftime show performer... I don't think Taylor Swift is actually baking sourdough bread. I think it was an Easter egg."What's NextSuper Bowl LX is scheduled for February 8, 2026, in Santa Clara, California. The halftime performer is often announced in the early portion of the regular NFL season, around September.
