Major U.S. cities are hosting protests on September 20.The protests, called Make Billionaires Pay, have been planned to coincide with world leaders coming to New York for the UN General Assembly and Climate Week and seek to make billionaires pay higher tax, support the climate and protect migrants.It is led by the activist groups Women's March, 350.org, Desis Rising Up and Moving (DRUM), and Climate Defenders.While the events are not primarily focussed on speaking up about the policies of Donald Trump, the websites do mention the current president, and voice opposition to his policies.Newsweek contacted the organizers by email outside of normal business hours to comment on this story.Why It MattersSince assuming office, Trump's popularity has fluctuated and he has been hit with multiple coordinated protests from different groups.Critics have spoke out against some of his executive actions and cuts to federal government, while he has also been hit with negative polls over his handling of the economy.Protests might dampen the administration's spirits, affect its reputation, force a response from Trump, or persuade it to change course. However, Trump still commands strong support from his conservative base.What To KnowThe protest centres on a march through New York City at 12pm but will also take place in other cities.The demands listed on the protest website include making billionaires pay more tax, stopping deportations, stopping U.S. involvement in Israel, and phasing out fossil fuels.On the Make Billionaires Pay website, it says: "Trump and billionaires are setting the world on fire. They're dismantling our democracy, attacking immigrants, feeding the war profiteers, and fueling the climate crisis. Our communities face attack after attack‚Äîfloods and fires fueled by Big Oil, ICE agenda kidnapping our neighbors, congress revoking our healthcare."Below is a map showing the cities that are involved in the protest.
The Make Billionaires Pay protests have been planned to coincide with world leaders coming to New York for the UN General Assembly and Climate Week.

The full list of 207 planned protests nationwide can be found here.What People Are SayingRenata Pumarol, deputy director of Climate Defenders, told Inside Climate News: "I hope we can scare Trump and his billionaire allies. We need to show them that we are organized, and that there are more of us than them.""The reason why we are targeting billionaires for this march is because we see the growing concentration of economic and political power," said Pumarol. "They are the class driving fascism and climate chaos, and they have the resources to fund a sustainable future."What Happens NextThe protests take place on September 20. A list of marches is available on this website.
