President Donald Trump announced that his administration is adding a $100,000 application fee for the H-1B visa program, a White House official confirmed to Newsweek on Friday.Trump then signed a proclamation in the Oval Office on Friday afternoon.The major H-1B reform would restrict entry under the work visa unless the hefty payment is made. The current fees to register for the visa lottery are $215, with an additional $780 fee for a Form I-129‚Äîa petition for a non-immigrant worker filed by an employer sponsor.Why It MattersThe work-based visa, popular with tech companies, has come under increasing scrutiny in 2025 against a backdrop of tougher immigration enforcement by the Trump administration and a simmering anti-immigrant sentiment in the U.S.Trump has been under pressure to act on the H-1B, despite being vocal in his support for the program over the years. The visa, which sees tens of thousands of new and renewed applications each year, has become a focal point for those seeking a more restrictionist approach.

Trump Expected to Sign Proclamation to Overhaul H-1B Visa ProgramThe president and Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick said the main change for the H-1B would be a new $100,000 fee. The current fee for an initial application is approximately $1,000.Trump told reporters that tech companies were on board with the changes, which he said would mean the U.S. would keep immigrants who would be "productive" for the country.
Another change could be to prevailing wage rules, meaning the amount employers must pay immigrant workers. This is an area critics have frequently pointed to, arguing that companies hire foreign workers because they can pay them less.It was unclear what the wage level would be, but a briefing note seen by Bloomberg stated that American workers were being replaced with foreign labor, particularly in STEM fields.Many immigration experts reacted to the initial reports of the change on social media, saying that it was unlikely the changes would be implemented with the stroke of Trump's pen.Under immigration law, it is Congress that has the power to change the fees charged by the Department of Homeland Security, not the Executive branch.What Other Changes Are Coming to the H-1B Visa Program?Earlier this week, Republican Senator Jim Banks introduced legislation in Congress to also make changes to the H-1B program.His bill would increase the wage floor for H-1B workers from $60,000 to $150,000, eliminate the Optional Practical Training (OPT) program, and replace the current lottery-based selection process with a system based on the highest bidder.Earlier in the summer, the White House approved a proposal for a new way of selecting H-1B visas. Details were not clear, but it was suggested that the current lottery system be replaced with one that selects candidates based on their wages.Current H-1B Visa Requirements: What To KnowCurrently, the H-1B visa is allocated through a lottery system, which is not intended to favor one company or applicant over another.However, larger companies can apply for more visas, resulting in a disproportionate number of H-1Bs being awarded to companies like Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft.Some employers are also not part of the lottery or cap system, including academic institutions.Companies also do not have to prove that an American-born worker cannot do the job, another part of the program that has come under heavy criticism.How Long Can Someone Stay in the US With an H-1B Visa?The H-1B is issued initially for three years, with the option of renewing at the end of that term for another three.Some H-1B holders then opt to apply for a green card, or lawful permanent residency.What People Are SayingJeremy Beck, co-president of NumbersUSA, an immigration reduction advocacy group, told Newsweek: "The Executive Branch can adjust fees, typically through the rulemaking process. We would have to see the precise details before giving a definitive response to this idea. In theory, however, this could be a significant step toward aligning the reality of the program with the stated intentions of its proponents."Charging a $100,000 fee would essentially call the bluff that so many corporations make when applying for H-1B workers, but it wouldn't block a necessary visa. If the guest worker truly possesses extraordinary skills that cannot be found in the domestic labor force, a $100,000 fee would be justified to fill a critical short-term gap until an American can be found."President Donald Trump, in the Oval Office, Friday: "We need workers. We need great workers. And this pretty much ensures this is going to happen."Democratic Washington Representative Pramila Jayapal, on X: "These are visas for skilled workers ‚Äî doctors, scientists, and engineers. This move will hurt US innovation and exacerbate an already serious shortage of medical professionals. In what world does this make sense??"David Bier, director of immigration studies at the Cato Institute, on X: "The most anti-legal immigration administration in American history continues to threaten US prosperity and freedom. This action would kill the H-1B visa and ban some of the highest-value employees in America. Utterly incomprehensible."Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said on a call with reporters, "So no longer will you put trainees on an H-1B visa. That it's just not economic anymore. If you're going to train people, you're going to train Americans. ... If you have a very sophisticated engineer and you want to bring them in ... then you can pay $100,000 a year for your H-1B visa."What Happens NextTrump said Friday evening that the new policy was backed by U.S. companies, which would pay the new fee. An implementation date has not been announced yet.Update 9/19/25 3:21 p.m. ET: This article was updated with additional information.
