Why It MattersLee's win restores the Minnesota House to a 67-67 tie, and preserves a bipartisan power-sharing arrangement brokered after the 2024 elections.This was the first election to take place since the assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk last Wednesday, and came amid heightened national attention to political violence.What To KnowCommenting on his victory, Lee promised to "work hard every day" to honor Hortman's legacy."We did our best to make her proud: knocking on doors daily, making phone calls, and texting every neighbor we could," he said.Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin said that Lee's "commitment to expanding access to education, affordable health care, and good-paying jobs honors the legacy" of Hortman.There was a slightly lower turnout on Tuesday with 26,596 votes, compared to the 26,827 votes in November, 2024.The election came three months after Hortman and her husband, Mark, were gunned down in their home by a man impersonating a police officer. State Senator John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, were also shot, but survived.Vance Boelter, 57, faces federal and state murder, attempted murder and other charges for the attacks on June 14.

Election underway for seat left empty by last act of political violence
What People Are SayingMartin said in a statement: "Across Minnesota, our hearts are still broken by the horrific assassination that stole Melissa and her husband Mark."Political violence is a scourge that has taken far too many lives. Enough is enough. It must end now. And in every case, each of us has a responsibility to condemn and reject political violence wherever it rears its head."Representative Zack Stephenson, Hortman's successor as the top Democrat in the Minnesota House, said that Lee's victory restores their caucus to full strength ahead of a potential special session that Governor Tim Walz wants on school security and gun violence after a recent church shooting."That means we'll prioritize the safety of our kids instead of access to weapons of war, and we'll make our economy work better for all Minnesotans, not just the billionaires," he said.Bittner said political violence made her question whether to run for office, but concluded that "there's no way to solve this problem if we shrink back in fear."What Happens NextTwo further special elections will be held on November 4 to fill two Senate seats.One was vacated by Democratic senator Nicole Mitchell, who resigned after being convicted of burglarizing her estranged stepmother's home. The other is for the seat of Republican Senator Bruce Anderson, who died in July.Update 09/18/25 09.05 a.m. ET: The vote share figures in this article were updated.
