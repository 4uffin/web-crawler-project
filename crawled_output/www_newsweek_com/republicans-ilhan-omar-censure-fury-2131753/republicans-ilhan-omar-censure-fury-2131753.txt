The four Republicans who voted against censuring Democratic Representative Ilhan Omar for comments about slain conservative commentator Charlie Kirk are facing fierce backlash.A 214-213 House vote on Wednesday defeated Republican Representative Nancy Mace's push to censure Omar and remove her from all committee assignments, with the measure failing by one vote.The Republicans who voted against the measure said they did so to uphold free speech, but they have faced the ire of MAGA commentators who have accused them of betraying their party.Newsweek contacted the four Republican congressmen for comment via contact form on their websites on Thursday outside of regular working hours.

Why It MattersThe fallout from the censure vote highlights the deep polarization in the U.S. after Kirk's killing, who was shot dead at a Utah university last week.Many on the right have reacted strongly to those perceived to be celebrating or mocking Kirk's death, calling for consequences such as losing their jobs or in Omar's case, being censured.At the same time, critics‚Äîincluding the four Republicans who opposed the censure measure‚Äîhave raised concerns that these actions risk infringing on free speech.What To KnowFour Republicans‚ÄîRepresentatives Mike Flood of Nebraska, Jeff Hurd of Colorado, Tom McClintock of California and Cory Mills of Florida‚Äîvoted against Mace's measure.Mace said she had taken action against Omar over her "disgraceful remarks" about Kirk's death, listing several posts reposted by Omar on X, formerly Twitter, that were critical of the commentator. She also referenced an interview in which she said Omar "smeared Charlie Kirk and implied he was to blame for his own murder."Omar denied making such comments and noted that the resolution included no direct quotes from her.The four Republican lawmakers who opposed the censure said they condemned Omar's actions but voted against the measure to uphold free speech and First Amendment protections.They have faced forceful condemnation from many on the right.Mace has led the criticism, writing on X that "4 Republicans sold out tonight. They sided with Democrats to protect Ilhan Omar."Conservative commentator Laura Loomer also weighed in, writing on X: "Outrageous. Why would any Republican vote to protect this jihadist?"Commentator Mark Levin wrote on X: "4 disgraceful House Republicans supported Islamist Omar despite her cackling at Charlie Kirk's assassination. All 4 need to be primaried and defeated."Conservative radio talk show host Joe Pags wrote on X: "It makes me sick that four republicans shirked their duty today and did NOT censure Ilhan Omar."Former county GOP chair Anthony Sabatini posted a series of messages criticizing Mills, calling him a "scumbag piece of trash" and a "fake Republican."What People Are SayingSpeaking about the four Republicans, Ilhan Omar told The Independent: "I'm glad that there are at least four that are left that believe in the First Amendment and are willing to protect the rights of members to not be punished for things that they haven't done."Jeff Hurd said in a post on X: "I voted against today's censure because it tried to strip another Member of Congress from committees and to silence her for exercising the First Amendment right to free speech."Tom McClintock said in a post on X: "This disgusting and hateful speech is still speech and is protected by our First Amendment."Cory Mills said in a post on X: "We may not like or agree with what someone says, but that does not mean we should deny their protected 1A Right."What Happens NextTrump-aligned Republicans may continue pursuing action against those they see as disrespecting Kirk's death, which will continue to raise questions about free speech protections.
