MoviesHorror MoviesComedyNews Article‘Anaconda’ Trailer Gives First Look at Jack Black and Paul Rudd RebootPublishedSep 17, 2025 at 12:08 PM EDTupdatedSep 17, 2025 at 12:09 PM EDTBy James BrizuelaContributing WriterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberJack Black and Paul Rudd might be two of the most beloved actors in the world, so it was only a matter of time until the pair teamed up for a movie.More news: 50 Cent Drops Epic Training Video as 'Street Fighter' Character BalrogThat is the case, as both comedic actors are now set to reboot one of the biggest horror movies from the 1990s, "Anaconda." However, this reboot is more so a parody that starts as a reboot, but is definitely not a reboot.The trailer gives a first look at Black and Rudd in the film that boasts a big time comedic angle, as well as jumping into the horror of the trying to escape a really big snake.Initially, Doug (Jack Black) and Griff (Paul Rudd) hatch a plan to reboot the 1997 film "Anaconda," which originally starred Jeniffer Lopez, Ice Cube, and Jon Voight.But Doug and Griff are deadset on remaking the film from the 1990s, and put together a hilarious premise of not only dressing like characters from the original film, but also renting a steamboat similar to the one in the film....More news: Tony Todd's Widow Calls Out Emmys After 'In Memoriam' SnubWhat is Anaconda About?The trailer showcases their reboot film getting off to a great start, until Doug accidentally kills their presumably trained snake. While they are attempting to figure out their next steps, a real giant-sized anaconda appears, wreaking havoc on their reboot.The film appears to go off the rails past this point, as Doug, Griff, and Claire (Thandie Newton) must now escape the clutches of a river monster.According to the official synopsis of the film:A midlife crisis inspires Doug (Jack Black) and Griff (Paul Rudd) to head into the Amazon rainforest to remake their favorite film from their youth, but everything changes when a real giant anaconda shows up, turning the comically chaotic set into a deadly situation. The movie they're dying to make? It might just kill them.Black and Rudd also spoke to PEOPLE about the film, and working with one another as the main reason for this "Anaconda" reboot."The Jumanji actor adds that it was 'so fun' to team up with Rudd. 'It was the main reason I wanted to do the movie,' says Black. 'I'm a huge fan of Paul's work. Dude is f---ing hilarious. And a sweet pea to boot!'"Likewise, for Rudd: 'I love Jack and was thrilled to get to do this with him. We've done a few little things in the past, and to get to really work together for months like this was fantastic.'"When does Anaconda Come Out?The "Anaconda" reboot also stars Daniela Melchior, Selton Mello, and Steve Zahn, and the film will release in Christmas 2025.For more movie news, head to Newsweek Movies.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For You50 Cent Drops Epic Training Video as ‘Street Fighter’ Character Balrog2 min. readThe Super Mario Galaxy Movie Announced for Spring 20261 min. readYou Can Now Watch All ‘Twilight’ Movies for Free – Here’s How3 min. read‘The Conjuring’ Series Greenlit Following Final Film’s Box Office Record2 min. read‘Weapons’ Gets Official Digital and At-Home Release Date – How to Watch2 min. readBluey Movie Release Date Will Have Fans Waiting for Years2 min. readDownton Abbey: The Grand Finale Star Shares What He’ll Miss Most4 min. readThe Naked Gun Gets New Digital Release Date – How To Watch3 min. readJames Gunn Reveals Title and Release Date for ‘Superman’ Sequel3 min. readRelated PodcastsTop StoriesNewsGov.
