TVFriendsStreamingNews ArticleIconic ‘Friends’ Coffeehouse to Receive Permanent New York LocationPublishedSep 16, 2025 at 07:55 PM EDTBy James BrizuelaContributing WriterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberThere might not be a more recognizable and iconic sitcom than "Friends." The series debuted on September 22, 1994, on NBC, and sent shockwaves through the TV world.More news: Matt Reeves Drops Major Update on 'The Penguin' Season 2Starring Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer, the series followed six friends who are in their early 20s and 30s, as they navigate life in New York City.The sitcom helped launch the careers of all six stars, who have gone on to become TV and film stars....More news: 'Harry Potter' Day Celebrated With Reveal of Original Cast Member ReturnOne of the most beloved aspects of the sitcom is the iconic "Central Perk" coffeehouse, which sat below the apartment building that Rachel (Jennifer Aniston), Monica (Courteney Cox), Joey (Matt LeBlanc), and Chandler (Matthew Perry) lived in.A lot of the scenes were shot on the famous orange couch, where the friends shared some of their best one-liners and stories.As part of the show's longstanding fandom, "Central Perk" pop-ups were showcased in New York City and at The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf in Los Angeles over the years.Now, New York will get the first official and permanent "Central Perk" location.According to Variety, "Launching in fall 2025, the café promises artisanal coffee drinks and 'Friends'-inspired food items guided by 'Top Chef' judge and James Beard Award winner Tom Colicchio. Central Perk will include a replica of the orange sofa, merchandise and take-home coffee blends available for purchase."The new location for "Central Perk" in New York will be at Times Square, on the northeast corner of 7th Avenue and 47th Street. This is the second permanent location, with the first opening in Boston in 2023.Peter van Roden, the EVP of Warner Bros. Discovery Global Experiences, stated to Variety about the location opening:"Central Perk is one of the most iconic landmarks in television history. After the incredible response in Boston, bringing Central Perk to Times Square isn't just the next step — it's a homecoming. This is about delivering an experience in the heart of Manhattan, where the story began, and letting fans from around the world step into a space that's both nostalgic yet freshly reimagined. There's no better place than New York City to celebrate the legacy of 'Friends' and to continue building on the connection fans feel with Central Perk."It is a bit strange that New York wasn't the first place where a permanent location opened, given that the sitcom mostly took place in the city. However, fans will be able to sit on the orange couch and drink specialty coffee starting this fall.For more TV news, head to Newsweek TV.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouIconic ‘Friends’ Coffeehouse to Receive Permanent New York Location3 min. read‘Futurama’ Season 13: Early Reviews Are Very Telling3 min. readThe Morning Show Season 4 Episode 1 – Release Date, Schedule, How To Watch3 min. readGen V Season 2 Episode 1 – Release Date, Schedule, How To Watch3 min. readMatt Reeves Drops Major Update on ‘The Penguin’ Season 22 min. readThe Summer I Turned Pretty Season 3 Finale – Release Date, Schedule, How To Watch5 min. readBeauty in Black Season 2 – Release Date, Schedule, How To Watch3 min. readNew True Crime Series ‘The Dead Girls’ Hits Netflix – Release Date, Schedule, How To Watch3 min. readAlien: Earth Episode 7 – Release Date, Schedule, How To Watch3 min. readRelated PodcastsTop StoriesU.S.Army Black Hawk Crash Update: Flight Tracker Shows Path as 4 On Board3 min. readPoliticsMMRV Vaccine Recommendations Modified by RFK Jr.’s CDC Panel5 min. readPoliticsAt Least 12 NYC Democratic Officials Detained by DHS4 min. readPoliticsABC, Nexstar and the FCC—What’s Behind Jimmy Kimmel Being ‘Canceled’?8 min. readNewsCharlie Kirk Funeral: Where, When and How to Watch Memorial3 min. readPoliticsDonald Trump Praises George Orwell Amid Free Speech Crackdown Concerns4 min. readTrendingGreen CardGreen Card Update: Applicants Receive Major Boost3 min. readCharlie kirkWhat Lance Twiggs’ Social Media Reveals About Tyler Robinson’s Trans Partner4 min. readImmigrationICE Detains Green Card Holder Dad with Tumor After 30 Years in US—Attorney4 min. readBreaking NewsTyler Robinson’s Full Text Exchange with Roommate Lance Twiggs Revealed8 min. readMississippiWho Is Demartravion ‘Trey’ Reed?
