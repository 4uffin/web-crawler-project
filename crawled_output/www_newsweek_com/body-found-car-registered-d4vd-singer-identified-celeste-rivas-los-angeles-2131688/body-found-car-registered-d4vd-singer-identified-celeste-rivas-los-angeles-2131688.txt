D4vd has over 33 million monthly listeners on Spotify and 3.7 million followers on TikTok. He released his debut album earlier this year and two extended plays in 2023. His song "Feel It" charted 75th on the Billboard Hot 100 in May and he was on tour when the body was found.What To KnowThe medical examiner's office said, when the remains were found, that the girl was wearing a tube top, black leggings, stud earrings and a yellow bracelet. She had black hair, a tattoo on her right index finger that read "Shhh" and weighed about 71 pounds. The report said it appeared the girl had been dead for a long time and that her remains were not intact.Police said there is no suspect in the case and that D4vd, whose upcoming show in Seattle was canceled when the car and body were found earlier this month, was cooperating with authorities.What People Are SayingThe Los Angeles Police Department said in a statement to NBC News: "At this time, the LAPD does not have a crime classification from the coroner as to the mode or manner of death. Thus, we do not have any suspect information at this time."The Riverside County Sheriff's Office said in a statement it had confirmed with "the Los Angeles Police Department that Celeste Rivas Hernandez has been identified as the juvenile who was reported missing from Lake Elsinore."A spokesperson for D4vd told NBC that he was "fully cooperating with the authorities."What Happens NextThe authorities are likely to release further information about the case and the cause of Rivas' death as their investigation continues.
