Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, speaking Tuesday at a panel discussion during a "Constitution and Citizenship Day Summit," issued a warning about so-called "bad laws.""Remember that slavery and desegregation were laws, too. The assumption that all laws are good is not necessarily a starting proposition," the liberal justice told a New York Law School crowd Tuesday.While Sotomayor did not refer to any particular attorney or representative, her comments came after U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi suggested she, and the wider Trump administration, would go after those who engage in hate speech.Why It MattersSupreme Court Justices have at times weighed in on national conversations about policy or law outside of their courtroom, and with only three liberal justices on the bench at the moment, Sotomayor has been left to voice their disapproval of the Trump administration's moves at times over recent months.

What To KnowSotomayor was appearing as part of a panel at the New York Law School, during which she was asked if the rule of law was under threat."We've already experienced, in our country, bad laws, laws that even the Supreme Court at one point said were unconstitutional, OK?" she said. "That only happens, however, if people don't understand ... that what the rule of law means is that we're being ruled by citizens who have thoughtfully considered and engaged in the process of law."The moment we take the people out of the equation ‚Äî which is happening more and more with so many people who are not voting ‚Äî once we do that, we do lose the republic."The justice, who has been on the court since 2009, did not mention the president or Bondi during the panel, USA Today reported, but she appeared to criticize the current administration several times.At one point, she told the students that "adults have really messed up" the country, and that people needed to understand the difference between a president and a king.Sotomayor's comments come amid concerns around the Trump administration's apparent plan to crack down on hate speech, despite it being protected under the First Amendment.It's the latest test of the U.S. Constitution by the White House, which has insisted it is honoring the laws during multiple court cases challenging the rollout of policies from immigration to federal workforce reductions.At times, officials, including senior advisor Stephen Miller, have raged against federal judges for standing in their way by issuing nationwide injunctions, some of which Sotomayor and her colleagues have then had brought before them.Also on Tuesday, Sotomayor called social media "one of the largest causes of misinformation on the internet.""If you are only hearing one side of the story, you are not making an informed decision," Sotomayor said. "The world is a complex place and issues are always difficult."The Bronx-born justice said she became interested in civics in grammar school, where she began debating issues, and improved those skills when she learned to debate both sides of a single issue.What People Are SayingSotomayor, speaking to students Tuesday: "Think of everything that's happening in the United States. And you have to pause and say, 'We adults have really messed this up'. My hope is that the students who participate in programs like this will figure out how to do a better job."U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, on X: "Hate speech that crosses the line into threats of violence is NOT protected by the First Amendment. It's a crime. For far too long, we've watched the radical left normalize threats, call for assassinations, and cheer on political violence. That era is over."What's NextSotomayor said she hoped that students of today would find solutions for the issues facing the U.S. right now.This article includes reporting by the Associated Press.
