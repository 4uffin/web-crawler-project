What to Know About TPUSA's HeadquartersTurning Point USA (TPUSA) is a conservative nonprofit student organization headquartered at 4940 E. Beverly Road, Phoenix. Founded in 2012 by Charlie Kirk and Bill Montgomery, TPUSA aims to identify, educate, train and organize students to promote free markets, individual liberty and limited government.In 2018, the group opened its national headquarters in Phoenix, a move intended to position itself closer to one of its largest campus chapter networks ‚Äî including Arizona State University ‚Äî and to benefit from a more politically friendly environment than some other states of origin.As of the latest reports, TPUSA has campus presence on thousands of high schools and colleges across all 50 states and operates with several hundred full- and part-time staff members.The organization "received over 32,000 inquiries in the last 48-hours to start new campus chapters," Turning Point spokesperson Andrew Kolvet, who is also executive producer of "The Charlie Kirk Show," said in a post on X on Sunday."To put that in perspective, TPUSA currently has 900 official college chapters and around 1,200 high school chapters, with a presence of 3,500 total."A spokesperson for Turning Point USA told Newsweek that requests for new high school and college chapters have since topped 60,000. "These requests are coming from students all over the country," the spokesperson said.Update: 9/17/25, 1:04 p.m. ET: This article was updated with new information and remarks.Update: 9/17/25, 1:21 p.m. ET: This article was updated with new information.Update: 9/17/25, 5:33 p.m. ET: This article was updated with new information and remarks.
