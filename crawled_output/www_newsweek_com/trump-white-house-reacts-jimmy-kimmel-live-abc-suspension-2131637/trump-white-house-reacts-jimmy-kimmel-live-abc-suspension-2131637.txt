President Donald Trump has responded after ABC suspended Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show indefinitely after comments by the host on Charlie Kirk's killing led a group of network-affiliated stations to say it would not air the show.Why It MattersThe killing of conservative commentator Kirk at Utah Valley University on September 10 and the national reaction to it have intensified scrutiny of political speech and how public figures respond to politically charged violence.Critics say public commentary from influential media figures and elected officials can shape the tone of public discourse; supporters say satire and critique are central to political commentary.The suspension of Kimmel's show feeds into those larger conversations while unfolding alongside the criminal investigation into Kirk's death.What To KnowAn ABC spokesperson said earlier Wednesday that Jimmy Kimmel Live! will be "pre-empted indefinitely."Trump welcomed the decision to yank Kimmel off the air in a post on his Truth Social platform."Great News for America: The ratings challenged Jimmy Kimmel Show is CANCELLED. Congratulations to ABC for finally having the courage to do what had to be done. Kimmel has ZERO talent, and worse ratings than even Colbert, if that's possible."That leaves Jimmy and Seth, two total losers, on Fake News NBC. Their ratings are also horrible. Do it NBC!!! President DJT," he said, referring to Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers.Newsweek contacted Kimmel's representative for comment.Kirk, 31, was a staunch supporter of Trump and a face of the MAGA movement for younger generations.The controversy over Kimmel centered on remarks he made in a monologue on Monday in which he floated the idea that the suspect in the killing, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, could be aligned with "the MAGA gang" or possibly "one of them."Kimmel also took a swipe at a response Trump gave to a reporter who asked the president how he was holding up in the aftermath of Kirk's death.Earlier Tuesday, Taylor Budowich, deputy White House chief of staff, posted to X: "Welcome to Consequence Culture. Normal, common sense Americans are no longer taking the bull**** and companies like ABC are finally willing to do the right and reasonable thing. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"The Trump administration's Rapid Response X account posted, "They're doing their viewers a favor. Jimmy is a sick freak!"BREAKING: The FCC Chairman is threatening immediate action against Jimmy Kimmel, ABC, and Disney for deliberately misleading the public by claiming Charlie Kirk‚Äôs assassin was a MAGA Conservative.Chairman Brendan Carr calls Kimmel‚Äôs malicious lies are ‚Äútruly sick‚Äù and says they‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/mGhtGMPReI‚Äî Benny Johnson (@bennyjohnson) September 17, 2025
Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chair Brendan Carr had earlier Wednesday threatened action against ABC over Kimmel's monologue.Speaking on Benny Johnson's podcast Wednesday, Carr said the agency has "remedies we can look at" and warned, "We can do this the easy way or the hard way. These companies can find ways to change conduct and take action, frankly, on Kimmel or there's going to be additional work for the FCC ahead."Kimmel, like CBS late-night host Stephen Colbert, has consistently been critical of Trump and many of his policies on his show. CBS said in July that it was canceling Colbert's show at the end of this season for financial reasons, although some critics have wondered if his stance on Trump played a role.What People Are SayingCalifornia Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom, on X Wednesday: "Buying and controlling media platforms. Firing commentators. Canceling shows. These aren't coincidences. It's coordinated. And it's dangerous. The @GOP does not believe in free speech. They are censoring you in real time."Carr, on X Wednesday: "I want to thank Nexstar for doing the right thing. Local broadcasters have an obligation to serve the public interest. While this may be an unprecedented decision, it is important for broadcasters to push back on Disney programming that they determine falls short of community values. I hope that other broadcasters follow Nexstar's lead."Andrew Alford, president of Nexstar's broadcasting division, said in a statement: "Mr Kimmel's comments about the death of Mr Kirk are offensive and insensitive at a critical time in our national political discourse, and we do not believe they reflect the spectrum of opinions, views, or values of the local communities in which we are located."What Happens NextNational conversations about free-speech protections and responses to political violence following Kirk's assassination look sure to continue.Reporting by the Associated Press contributed to this article.
