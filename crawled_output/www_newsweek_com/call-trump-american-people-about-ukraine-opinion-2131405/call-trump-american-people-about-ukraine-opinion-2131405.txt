As Ukraine marked another year of independence, Vladimir Putin responded with one of the worst fusillades of missiles since his unprovoked full-scale war of aggression began over three years ago. A week after being accorded red carpet treatment by President Donald Trump at the so-called peace summit in Anchorage, Putin retaliated by refusing a ceasefire, calling for Ukraine to turn over its land to Russia, and conducting one of the worst ever bombardments of Ukraine. Russia is firing double the number of missile strikes from years before, with mounting civilian casualties. Just days ago, Russian drones violated Polish airspace, drawing a reaction from NATO.This is not the behavior of a peace-seeking actor.

The only way to deal with Putin is not by coddling him but by recognizing his true intentions. Clearly Putin is determined to see nothing less than the destruction of a democratic Ukraine tethered to Europe and has no respect for the international rule of law or his counterparts. America's leadership must recognize the gravity of the consequences if we cave to Putin. Negotiations are meaningless unless Putin begins to pay a price in tougher economic sanctions and greater military support to Ukraine. Further, there can be no peace dictated without the input of the Ukrainian people.We stand with Ukrainian civil society, which is demanding meaningful accountability from the international community. Land swaps and territorial concessions must not be considered lightly, as they threaten the fundamental right of all Ukrainians to live in dignity in their own homeland. The men and women who bear the daily burden of this war‚Äîthe fighters, frontline defenders, and those suffering under occupation‚Äîare the true guardians of Ukraine's democratic future. They deserve formal mechanisms for representation in any peace process.Ukrainians overwhelmingly reject ceding territory. To do so would be to forsake those living under Russia's oppressive occupation to forced disappearances, deportations, unlawful detentions, torture, and even the kidnapping of Ukraine's children. These are not abstractions‚Äîthey constitute the atrocities committed by Russia daily, and they reflect a deliberate assault on Ukraine's independence, identity, and culture.A journalist recounted a haunting story to us of a child in an occupied town who was forced to sing the Russian national anthem each morning in school. When the boy said he didn't know the words, a teacher made him memorize them and sing before the class‚Äîonly for him to defiantly sing the Ukrainian anthem instead. If a child can find the courage to stand for freedom, international leaders must not succumb to fatigue and intimidation. Territorial integrity is not merely about land‚Äîit is ultimately about protecting people, and preserving their dignity, future, and unique identity. These are the perspectives Ukrainians will bring to a negotiation or peace process.The Ukrainian people are urgently calling on President Trump, Congress, and the American people to recognize the gravity of "peace negotiations." Innocent civilians, including children, continue to be killed in their neighborhoods in violation of international humanitarian law‚Äîeven as the war criminal is welcomed in the U.S. Ukraine has documented over 183,000 alleged war crimes since 2022. Human life is the cheapest resource for Russia. But for Ukraine‚Äîand for us‚Äîhuman lives matter. When Russian missiles can strike a school in less than 42 seconds‚Äîless time than it takes to digest this sentence‚Äîthe cost of war becomes tragically personal. Peace must be rooted in justice, not appeasement‚Äîand should not reward a war criminal for his aggression. As the adage goes, "Unpunished evil grows."Accountability is not revenge‚Äîit is our historic obligation to justice. The atrocities in Ukraine and beyond‚Äîin Syria, Sudan, Palestine, and elsewhere‚Äîare not accidents. They are the results of calculated decisions by leaders to break peace. If we allow such crimes to go unpunished, we normalize impunity and guarantee future violence.Security guarantees for Ukraine must be part of any end to the war, and the guarantees must be real. We must not repeat the failed precedents of the Budapest Memorandum and the Minsk II accords, both of which Russia violated almost immediately. Sustainable peace requires genuine, enforceable guarantees that clearly deter Putin from ever invading Ukraine again.True peace must also be inclusive. Civil society and women leaders‚Äîfar from passive bystanders‚Äîhave developed the Ukraine Peace Compact, outlining community-led priorities for justice, recovery, and governance. We call on President Trump, the Ukrainian government, and the international community to establish dialogue channels that draw on this expertise and ensure these voices directly inform any formal negotiations.What is at stake transcends Ukraine's borders: it is the future of the international order, where aggression is punished, sovereignty is defended, and human dignity is protected. Ukraine has shown immense courage. The U.S. and international community must do their part. There will be no peace without justice.Oleksandra Matviichuk is a Kyiv-based human rights lawyer and chairwoman of the 2022 Nobel Prize winning organization, The Center for Civil Liberties.
