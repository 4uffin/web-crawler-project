The Trump administration has notified Congress of plans to sell nearly $6 billion in weapons to Israel, the latest show of U.S. support as the country faces growing international isolation over its war in Gaza.Newsweek reached out to the White House by email on Friday evening for comment.Why It MattersIsrael this week commenced a fresh operation in Gaza that has drawn sharp criticism and condemnation from regional neighbors such as Qatar and Saudi Arabia.At the same time, the United Nations released a report that determined Israel is committing a genocide in Gaza‚Äîa conclusion that Israel has staunchly rejected, calling the report "fake" and claiming it "relies entirely on Hamas falsehoods, laundered and repeated by others."Meanwhile, some Republicans have grown more critical of aid to Israel‚Äîmost prominently, close Trump ally and supporter Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who was the first Republican to accuse Israel of committing a genocide. Greene also tried to add an amendment to a bill over the summer that would end all arms sales to Israel, but the amendment was flatly rejected by lawmakers, with only six voting in support of the measure.What To KnowPresident Donald Trump told Congress of his plans Friday, announcing a package of weapons for Israel that would total around $6 billion to bolster the Mideast nation's efforts. This adds to the already considerable weapons sales made earlier this year following Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's visit to the U.S.The package includes a $3.8 billion deal for 30 AH-64 Apache attack helicopters, nearly doubling Israel's fleet, and a $1.9 billion sale of 3,200 infantry assault vehicles for the army, a U.S. official and another person familiar with the proposal told the Associated Press. Both spoke on condition of anonymity because the plans have not been made public.Deliveries would take at least two to three years, officials said. The proposed sales come as U.S.-backed efforts to broker an end to Israel's nearly two-year conflict with Hamas have faltered, and days after Israel's strike on Hamas leaders in Doha, Qatar, drew sharp criticism from American allies in the region.The U.S. is committing to the sale even as administration officials continue to seek a peace deal to end Israel's operation in Gaza.Meanwhile, some European allies have moved to start recognizing a Palestinian state, including the United Kingdom and France. The United Kingdom also last year suspended exports of some weapons to Israel out of concerns that the country could be violating international humanitarian laws and recently barred Israeli officials from attending the country's biggest arms fair.Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni also condemned Israel's attack on Gaza as disproportionate.Turkey also said it was closing its airspace to Israeli government planes and any cargo of arms for the Israeli military.What People Are SayingGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz, in a statement in August: "From the German government's point of view, the even tougher military action of the Israeli army in the Gaza Strip, which was decided by the Israeli security cabinet last night, makes it increasingly difficult to see how these goals are to be achieved. Under these circumstances, the German government is not approving any exports of armaments that can be used in the Gaza Strip until further notice."British Foreign Secretary David Lammy said at a UN meeting in July: "Our support for Israel, its right to exist, and the security of its people, is steadfast. However, the Balfour Declaration came with the solemn promise that nothing shall be done, nothing which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of the Palestinian people as well. And colleagues, this has not been upheld, and it is a historical injustice which continues to unfold."Update 9/19/25, 6:42 p.m. ET: This article has been updated with additional information.This article includes reporting by the Associated Press.
