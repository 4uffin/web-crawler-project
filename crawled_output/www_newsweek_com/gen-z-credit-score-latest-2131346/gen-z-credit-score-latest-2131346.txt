Gen Z consumers are seeing their credit scores fall, a new report has found.According to data released by score developer FICO, on average, Gen Z's credit score has decreased by three points since 2024, a larger increase than any age group since 2020. FICO classified Gen Z as those ages 18 to 29.Why It MattersCredit scores are important as lenders look to them when evaluating whether to approve an application for a mortgage, car loan, or credit card. Scores can become lower when people do not pay their bills on time or use too many bank accounts.What To KnowFICO sets its range of scores between 300 and 850.It found that 14.1 percent of Gen Zers had a 50-point credit score decrease. This, they said, was more than any other year.

It blamed student loans as 34 percent of Gen Z consumers have open student loans and some are starting to repay them. In March, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York cautioned that student loan borrowers who are late on their payments would see their credit scores drop significantly.It also said that as Gen Zs have shorter credit histories, they have less examples of making payments on time. This makes their scores more volatile.Among all age demographics, the national average credit score has fallen from 718 in 2023 to 715 in 2024, the report found.Meanwhile, a recent ranking by personal finance firm WalletHub outlined cities with the highest and lowest credit scores in 2025. At the top of the rankings is South Burlington, Vermont, where residents boast an average credit score of 701. The lowest score is Detroit, Michigan where the average credit score is 566.What People Are SayingThe report said: "Gen Z consumers have had less time to build savings, and are less likely to benefit from stock market gains and home price appreciation," the analysis said. "Instead, they are more likely to have affordability issues and more likely to face the impacts of higher interest rates and inflation."Tommy Lee, senior director at FICO, told CNN: "We've seen a K-shaped economy where those with wealth tied to stock market portfolios and rising home values are doing well and others are struggling with high rates and affordability problems."Matt Schulz, chief credit analyst at LendingTree told CNBC: "I'm not surprised that credit scores are slipping. Millions of Americans are struggling mightily in the face of stubborn inflation, high interest rates, a difficult job market and overall economic uncertainty‚Äîand tough times often force tough decisions.""There's very little in life that's more expensive than having crummy credit. It can cost you tens of thousands of dollars over the years in fees and interest."What Happens NextFICO will start incorporating "buy now, pay later" loan data into its calculations for credit scores this fall.
