A judge on Tuesday dismissed terrorism charges against Luigi Mangione in New York State's case over the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, but kept the state's second-degree murder charges against the suspect.Mangione's lawyers argued that the New York case and a parallel federal death penalty prosecution amounted to double jeopardy. But Judge Gregory Carro rejected that argument, saying it would be premature to make such a determination.Why It MattersThe case against Mangione is one of the most closely watched murder prosecutions in recent years. Tuesday marked Mangione's first court appearance in the state case since February. Mangione, 27, has attracted a following, mostly on the left, as a stand-in for frustrations with the health insurance industry.

Luigi Mangione Appears in Court: What We KnowMangione wore a tan prison jumpsuit over a black shirt as he appeared in court in Lower Manhattan on Tuesday morning. His hair was cut short, and he was not wearing a bulletproof vest.The hearing lasted just a few minutes, with Judge Gregory Carro pressing ahead with setting a hearing schedule following efforts by Mangione's defense team to stay the state case. The attorneys had stated that the simultaneous federal and state cases against their client made it challenging to defend both.

Carro issued a written decision dismissing the terrorism charges against Mangione, saying that although Thompson's killing was not an ordinary street crime, New York law does not consider a crime allegedly motivated by ideology to be terrorism.Dozens of his supporters attended his latest hearing, many wearing the green color associated with the Luigi character from the Super Mario video game franchise as a symbol of solidarity. While his April arraignment in the federal case drew a similar outpouring, his latest hearing comes amid a national reckoning over political violence in the wake of the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk last week.Who Was UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson?Mangione is accused of murdering Brian Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, as Thompson arrived at a hotel in midtown Manhattan on December 4, 2024, after traveling from Minnesota.The 50-year-old had worked for the health care company for around two decades, becoming CEO in 2021. Company records showed his yearly salary was around $1 million, but his total earnings from stock awards and other compensation brought that to over $10 million.Thompson is survived by his wife, Paulette, and their two children.Luigi Mangione's Motive: What We KnowMangione was arrested five days after the shooting in New York City, around 230 miles away in Altoona, Pennsylvania.Luigi Mangione supporters unbowed after Charlie Kirk killingRead more

New York State prosecutors allege that Mangione wanted to "intimidate or coerce a civilian population" through his alleged actions‚Äînamely, insurance employees and investors. Federal prosecutors allege that Mangione stalked Thompson.In writings that the Manhattan District Attorney's Office says are from Mangione, he mused about rebelling against "the deadly, greed fueled health insurance cartel" and said killing an industry executive "conveys a greedy bastard that had it coming."Prosecutors have said that Mangione clearly wanted to bring about a "revolutionary change to the healthcare industry."Mangione has pleaded not guilty to multiple murder charges.

What People Are SayingJudge Gregory Carro, in his written decision: "While the defendant was clearly expressing an animus toward UHC, and the health care industry generally, it does not follow that his goal was to 'intimidate and coerce a civilian population,' and indeed, there was no evidence presented of such a goal."Abril Rios, 26, one of Mangione's supporters outside court, told Newsweek: "It's always sobering to see him in person because it's so different from images. You really see the paleness, the cracks, dehydration. It's sad to see him like that, I wish he were getting more sun, obviously, but I'm sure he's feeling happy after today."When Is Luigi Mangione Due Back in Court?Mangione glanced at the gallery as he was led out of the courtroom. Carro scheduled his next appearance for December 1.This story includes reporting by the Associated Press.Update 9/16/25, 1:24 p.m. ET: This article was updated with additional information.
