New York State Democratic Chairman Jay Jacobs says he will not be endorsing New York State Assemblyman and Democratic nominee for mayor Zohran Mamdani in a statement on Thursday.Newsweek reached out to Mamdani's campaign via email for comment.Why It MattersThe split matters because unified state and national party support is often viewed as critical in high-profile municipal contests.New York Democratic Governor Kathy Hochul's backing of Mamdani could be an attempt to consolidate Democrats, but key figures ‚Äî including some congressional leaders and local officials ‚Äî have remained neutral.What To KnowMamdani, a New York state assemblyman who identifies as a democratic socialist, won the Democratic primary over former governor Andrew Cuomo in June and is the party's nominee for mayor.In a statement posted on X by New York Times Nicholas Fandos on Thursday, Jacobs said in part, "Mr. Mamdani and I are in agreement that America's greatest problem is the continued growth in income disparity in our nation. On how to address it--we fundamentally disagree."Furthermore, as I expressed to him directly, I strongly disagree with his views on the State of Israel, along with certain key policy positions. Furthermore, I reject the platform of the so-called 'Democratic Socialists of America' and do not believe that it represents the principles, values, or policies of the Democratic Party," Jacobs added."For those reasons I will not be endorsing Mr. Mamdani for Mayor of the City of New York," he concluded.Mamdani seemingly defended the phrase "globalize Intifada" as "a desperate desire for equality and equal rights in standing up for Palestinian human rights" in the past. He also called antisemitism a "real issue" in New York City and said Hamas' attack in Israel on October 7 was a "war crime."Over the weekend, Hochul announced her endorsement of Mamdani, saying on X, "New York City deserves a mayor who will stand up to Donald Trump and make life more affordable for New Yorkers. That's @ZohranKMamdani."After Hochul's endorsement, some high-profile Democrats ‚Äî including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries ‚Äî had not publicly endorsed Mamdani.President Donald Trump criticized Hochul's endorsement in public comments and social posts, framing it as problematic for the city and suggesting federal scrutiny of funding.

What People Are SayingTrump on Truth Social this week: "Governor Kathy Hochul of New York has Endorsed the 'Liddle' Communist,' Zohran Mamdani, running for Mayor of New York. This is a rather shocking development, and a very bad one for New York City. How can such a thing happen? Washington will be watching this situation very closely. No reason to be sending good money after bad! President DJT".Independent Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont on X this month: "The oligarchs are panicking. They will spend as much as it takes to try to defeat Zohran Mamdani. They've got the money. We've got the people. Together, let's elect Zohran and stop billionaires from buying elections."What Happens NextWith the general election scheduled for November 4, 2025, Democrats' decisions to coalesce or remain fragmented could affect turnout, fundraising, and messaging.Observers say endorsements from prominent leaders often translate into practical campaign support, but Mamdani's polling lead in recent surveys complicates the calculus for hesitant officials.
