President Donald Trump blasted Democratic Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota on Thursday, ripping her birth country and questioning her citizenship.Newsweek reached out to the congresswoman's D.C. office Thursday evening and left a voicemail.
Why It MattersThe post by the president arrives as Representative Omar faced a censure push initiated by Republican Representative Nancy Mace of South Carolina over disputes tied to alleged comments about the late conservative activist Charlie Kirk.The dispute has escalated on social media and in the House, underscoring tensions on Capitol Hill and the broader politicized debate about political rhetoric and violence.What To KnowIn a post on Truth Social Thursday night, Trump said, "Ilhan Omar's Country of Somalia is plagued by a lack of central Government control, persistent Poverty, Hunger, Resurgent Terrorism, Piracy, decades of Civil War, Corruption, and pervasive Violence. 70% of the population lives in extreme Poverty, and widespread Food Insecurity."Somalia is consistently ranked among the World's Most Corrupt Countries, including Bribery, Embezzlement, and a Dysfunctional Government. All of this, and Ilhan Omar tells us how to run America! P.S. Wasn't she the one that married her brother in order to gain Citizenship??? What SCUM we have in our Country, telling us what to do, and how to do it. Thank you for your attention to this matter. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"Is Ilhan Omar Being Censured?Omar reacted on X to Mace's censure move on Tuesday, saying, "Fun fact: Nancy Mace is trying to censure me over comments I never said. Her res does not contain a single quote from me because she couldn't find any. Unlike her, I have routinely condemned political violence, no matter the political ideology."Omar continued, "This is all an attempt to push a false story so she can fundraise and boost her run for Governor."Mace's attempt to censure Omar ultimately failed in the House this week.This is a developing story that will be updated with additional information.
