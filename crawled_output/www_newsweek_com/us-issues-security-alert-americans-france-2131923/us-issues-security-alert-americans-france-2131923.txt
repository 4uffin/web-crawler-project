The U.S. State Department issued a new security alert for Americans in France, warning of the "possibility of violent clashes" amid protests."Strikes and protests are taking place across France. Public transport is significantly impacted, especially in the Paris metro area, and some schools are closed. Drivers may be impacted by road blockages, and there may be disruptions of other means of transportation‚Äîincluding flights, trains, and taxi services," the alert posted to X and the department's website said."The possibility of violent clashes between protestors and French security and law enforcement remains high. Avoid the areas of the demonstrations."Why It MattersThe U.S. State Department often issues travel alerts for high-risk parts of the world, intended as a warning to American citizens either not to travel or exercise caution in doing so. Such warnings for France specifically are not uncommon, with the country often experiencing unrest due to protests or strike action.

What To KnowThe warning from the State Department and the U.S. Embassy in France came amid a day of strikes and protests taking place across the European country on Thursday, with hundreds of thousands of participants expected.In an update on the embassy website, U.S. officials said "the possibility of violent clashes between protestors and French security and law enforcement remains high".Americans were told to avoid demonstration areas, exercise caution in areas where protests and strikes were taking place, and keep an eye on updates from local officials and media.The prediction of law enforcement clashing with protestors did appear to come true, as voters made their voices heard over concerns about planned cuts under President Emmanuel Macron.The first whiffs of police teargas came before daybreak, with scuffles between riot officers and protesters in Paris. Nationwide demonstrations, from France's biggest cities to small towns, were expected to mobilize hundreds of thousands of marchers, voicing anger about mounting poverty, sharpening inequality and struggles for low-paid workers and others to make ends meet.Labor unions that called strikes are pushing for the abandonment of proposed budget cuts, social welfare freezes and other belt-tightening that opponents contend will further hit the pockets of low-paid and middle-class workers and which triggered the collapse of successive governments that sought to push through savings.Opponents of Macron's business-friendly leadership complain that taxpayer-funded public services ‚Äî free schools and public hospitals, subsidized health care, unemployment benefits and other safety nets that are cherished in France ‚Äî are being eroded.Left-wing parties and their supporters want the wealthy and businesses to pay more, rather than see spending cuts to plug holes in France's finances and to rein in its debts.The government said it was deploying police in exceptionally large numbers ‚Äî about 80,000 in all ‚Äî to keep order. Police were ordered to break up traffic blockades and other efforts to prevent people who weren't protesting from going about their business.Paris police used tear gas to disperse a pre-dawn blockade of a bus depot. French broadcasters also reported sporadic clashes in the cities of Nantes, in the west, and Lyon in the southeast, with volleys of police tear gas and projectiles targeting officers.The Interior Ministry reported 94 arrests nationwide by midday local time.What People Are SayingU.S. Embassy in France, on its website: "Public transport is significantly impacted, especially in the Paris metro area, and some schools are closed. Drivers may be impacted by road blockages, and there may be disruptions of other means of transportation ‚Äì including flights, trains, and taxi services. Pharmacies and other health services, including hospital support, may also be impacted."Fabien Villedieu, a leader of the SUD-Rail train workers union, told the Associated Press: "The bourgeoisie of this country have been gorging themselves, they don't even know what to do with their money anymore. So if there is indeed a crisis, the question is who should pay for it. We are asking that the government's austerity plan that consists of making the poorest in this country always pay ‚Äî whether they are employees, retirees, students ‚Äî ends and that we make the richest in this country pay."French National Police, on X: "Police officers and gendarmes remain mobilized to oversee the demonstrations and address the abuses targeting them... Our priority: to enable everyone to exercise their right to demonstrate in the best conditions and safely."What's NextThe State Department will likely issue further updates for American citizens in France as it sees fit, with the unrest in the country likely to continue for some time.Reporting by the Associated Press contributed to this story.
