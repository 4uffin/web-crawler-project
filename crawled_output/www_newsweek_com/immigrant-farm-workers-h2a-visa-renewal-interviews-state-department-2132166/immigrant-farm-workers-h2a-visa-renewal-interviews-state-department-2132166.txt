Immigrant farm workers were handed a win by the Trump administration on Thursday, with the State Department making a change to visa renewal requirements.After new rules were introduced requiring the majority of temporary visa holders‚Äîincluding H-2A temporary farm workers‚Äîto attend in-person interviews, the State Department said Thursday that it is lifting the requirement for that group."With heightened scrutiny of applicants, particularly students, social media vetting, and the regular security screenings already in place, officers are facing a steep increase in time spent per case, meaning their time is more limited and the number of cases they can process is lower," Matt Mauntel-Medici, an immigration attorney with Brown Winick in Iowa and a former U.S. consular officer, told Newsweek."This affects employers of all kinds, from financial services firms to manufacturers, but the agricultural sector is more hindered than others. All delays in processing create opportunity costs and can hinder operations."

Why It MattersPresident Donald Trump's immigration crackdown has left many farm owners concerned about maintaining staffing, with a large proportion being temporary migrant workers. Trump has voiced his support for the industry, but enforcement raids have continued, leaving farms struggling to recruit and keep those without long-term security.What To KnowEarly this month, the Trump administration introduced new visa interview requirements, essentially removing waivers that had been in place for many temporary immigrants already in the U.S. or with existing visas living abroad.Many first-time applicants, such as those under 14 and some elderly people, had been able to get a waiver, but that was dropped on September 2. The new rules allowed only certain government and diplomatic officials, and some visitor visa holders, to skip an in-person interview when renewing their documents.On Thursday, another category was added to the list of those who are eligible for an interview waiver‚ÄîH-2A visa holders, who are temporary farm workers. That means workers may be granted a waiver but are not guaranteed one.The visa category is temporary, and workers generally must renew every year. Adding in-person interview requirements would likely lead to difficulties for those with little means of traveling, and the farming industry has called for a modernized approach to ensure continued workforce levels.There are still caps on H-2A terms, with immigrants allowed a maximum of three years in the U.S., then must return home for at least 60 days before applying again.Whether the change by the State Department leads to other adjustments to the H-2A program remains to be seen. The U.S. Department of Agriculture previously told Newsweek that it was working to streamline and strengthen the process, but official announcements on program changes have yet to be made.What People Are SayingMatt Mauntel-Medici told Newsweek: "Here in Iowa our corn and soybean yields help to not only provide nutrition for people and livestock but also bring in critical dollars for our rural communities. If farmers are left with their yields unpicked, that directly translates to dollars lost for them, their families, their communities, states and country. That is hugely important across the country and especially here in Iowa."The reversal of the interview waiver restrictions on H-2A agricultural workers will speed up their processing, allowing these experienced workers to renew their visas and return to the U.S. to help our farmers in such a critical and time sensitive period. I am glad to see the administration putting farmers first and hope that they expand this to other industries."Ben Tindall, executive director of Save Family Farming, in a statement shared with Newsweek: "The heavily-regulated program, while costly and cumbersome, provides a lifeline for American farmers to continue producing food here, rather than watching American consumers eat even more food imported from foreign countries."Save Family Farming applauds the federal government's efforts to keep this program as efficient as possible, even while maintaining border security, safeguarding domestic workers, and protecting guest workers."The State Department, in its September 18 update: "Consular officers may still require in-person interviews on a case-by-case basis for any reason. Applicants should check embassy and consulate websites for more detailed information about visa application requirements and procedures, and to learn more about the embassy or consulate's operating status and services."A USDA spokesperson previously told Newsweek: "President Trump is putting America First and that includes strengthening the farm workforce and streamlining H-2A and H-2B visa programs. Our immigration system has been broken for decades, and we finally have a President who is enforcing the law and prioritizing fixing programs farmers and ranchers rely on to produce the safest and most productive food supply in the world."What Happens NextThe updated guidance will go into effect October 1.Update 9/18/25, 6:04 p.m. ET: This story was updated with comment from Ben Tindall.
