Target plans to open seven new stores in October 2025 across Arizona, California, Florida, Nebraska, South Carolina, Texas and Virginia, part of the retailer's multi-year plan to add more than 300 stores over the next decade.The openings‚Äîsix of which will exceed Target's 125,000-square-foot average‚Äîadvance the company's stores-as-hubs model that supports same-day fulfillment and in-store shopping, while creating local jobs and community investment, the company said.The ContextTarget's October openings reinforce the retailer's long-term growth strategy to reach more guests through larger-format stores that also serve as fulfillment hubs for same‚Äëday services such as Drive Up, Order Pickup and paid same‚Äëday delivery via Target Circle 360. The company says its stores fulfill the majority of its digital orders and that the new locations support job creation, with starting wages ranging by role and location.The October openings will feed into Target's stated plan to build more than 300 new stores over the next decade and to continue investing in remodels, supply‚Äëchain capacity and its Target Circle membership program. Local hiring, community partnerships and ramping fulfillment capacity at these stores are likely next steps as openings occur.
