Iran carried out suspected missile system tests near its capital, Tehran, on Thursday evening local time, according to reports shared by outlets linked to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).The launches have not been independently verified by Iranian authorities. The activity, visible across several provinces, was captured in photographs and videos posted on social media showing luminous trails arcing across the night sky.Newsweek has reached out to the U.S. State Department and Iran's Foreign Ministry for comment.Why It MattersThe missile tests come months after the 12-day war in June, when Israel and the United States carried out coordinated strikes on sites linked to Iran's nuclear program. Israel claimed to have destroyed portions of Iran's missile and nuclear capabilities, while U.S. forces targeted additional nuclear facilities.Thursday's launches demonstrate Iran's intent to project strength and protect its nuclear ambitions, while highlighting regional stakes as Europe and the U.S. push for renewed sanctions over alleged violations to the 2015 nuclear agreement.

Iran's Missile and Nuclear ProgramsIran's missile arsenal has long been a focal point of its confrontation with Israel and Western powers, with Tehran insisting the weapons are defensive.Its nuclear program, meanwhile, has drawn intensified scrutiny after U.S. and Israeli strikes earlier this year. France, Germany and the U.K. are moving to reimpose sanctions, accusing Tehran of breaching the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which U.S. President Donald Trump unilaterally abandoned in 2018.On Wednesday, just a day before the missile tests, Tehran rejected any talks with the U.S. on missile restrictions, framing such demands as an obstacle to diplomacy.

What People Are SayingIran's Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei: "The United States is in no position to make decisions about Iran's national defence capabilities."U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio: "A nuclear Iran governed by a radical [Shia] cleric that possesses not just nuclear weapons potentially but the missiles that could deliver those weapons far away is an unacceptable risk, not just for Israel, not just for the United States, but for the world."What Happens NextThursday's suspected missile tests reinforce Tehran's posture of defiance following coordinated U.S. and Israeli strikes on its nuclear and missile infrastructure.The U.N. Security Council is set to vote Friday on a draft resolution to snapback sanctions, part of the European-led effort over Tehran's alleged JCPOA violations. With negotiations stalled and Iran continuing to develop its arsenal, regional tensions are expected to remain high.
