Why It Matters Kirk, 31, was the co-founder and executive director of Turning Point USA, a prominent conservative campus organization, and the event was part of his "The American Comeback Tour," where attendees were invited to debate him in a public setting.News and videos of Kirk's assassination swept quickly through the country, with people immediately mourning his death and leaders and prominent figures across the political spectrum condemning the violence. Vice President JD Vance escorted Kirk's casket on Air Force Two while President Donald Trump ordered the lowering of flags, gestures that emphasize Kirk's prominence.The shooting comes amid a broader climate of political violence across the United States. In June, Minnesota Democratic state Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband were shot and killed in their home a targeted political act.What To Know"Charlie Kirk invited me to speak at Amfest a few weeks ago before he was martyred," Greene wrote in her post that attached a screenshot of the reported texts.Charlie Kirk invited me to speak at Amfest a few weeks ago before he was martyred.This was after I called for AIPAC to register under FARA and said that the nuclear armed secular government of Israel was committing genocide in Gaza and killing innocent children, Christians, and‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/Mk7WTQnT0M‚Äî Marjorie Taylor Greene üá∫üá∏ (@mtgreenee) September 17, 2025
She added that this invitation came after she called for American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), to register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act and publicly stated that "the nuclear armed secular government of Israel was committing genocide in Gaza and killing innocent children, Christians, and people."Israeli leaders have sent messages in support of Kirk, who was a staunch Israel ally. "A lion-hearted friend of Israel, he fought the lies and stood tall for Judeo-Christian civilization," Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wrote on X."I spoke to him only two weeks ago and invited him to Israel. Sadly, that visit will not take place," he added. Read more

Greene's X post comes as some prominent members on the right, including Tucker Carlson, have been discussing Kirk's relationship with Israel and the country's leaders. Carlson said on his show this week, Kirk "didn't hate Jews, he loved Jews ‚Ä¶ he loved the state of Israel, he loved going there, he did not like Bibi Netanyahu, he said that to me many times" which others like Candace Owens and Matt Gaetz, have backed.Carlson also said that Kirk felt Netanyahu was a "destructive force, he was appalled by what was happening in Gaza, he was above all resentful that he believed Netanyahu was using the United States to prosecute his wars for the benefit of his country."Greene nodded to the ongoing conversation in her X post, writing, "If you don't know who to believe, between Bibi Netanyahu (a foreign country's leader) or Charlie's personal friends Candace Owens and Tucker Carlson, I'm posting my last text message with Charlie. Believe Candace Owens and Tucker Carlson."The screenshot of the text from Kirk to Greene reads: "You should speak at Am-Fest!" in reference to Turning Point's annual AmericaFest conference, which is to be held in December."Would you want to also do a debate about aipac etc?" he asked, referring to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). "Not with me. No pressure. Well do whatever you want," he added.Greene concluded her post, writing, "Do not allow a foreign country, foreign agents, and another religion tell you about Charlie Kirk. And I hope a foreign country and foreign agents and another religion does not take over Christian Patriotic Turning Point USA."What People Are SayingIsraeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar in a September 11 X post: "Charlie Kirk was an incredible friend of Israel. Charlie represented the Judeo-Christian values that unite Israel and America."Candace Owens said in a September 16 X post: "Tucker Carlson just exposed everything Charlie was going through with his Jewish donors and what his true feelings were toward Bibi Netanyahu. Watch to comprehend how sinister the lies are the Zionist crowd is trying to tell right now. Messages exist. Stop lying."Former Representative Matt Gaetz said in an X post on Tuesday: "I have personal knowledge as to many of the claims Tucker is making here. They are 100 percent true."Senator Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, said in an X post on Wednesday in response to Carlson's video: "I'm getting really tired of Tucker & his cronies falsely claiming 'Charlie agreed with me that Israel is terrible & the problem in America is all the damn Jews....' I knew Charlie well & indeed the very last conversation we had was how deeply concerned he was about the rising, toxic wave of antisemitism on the right."What Happens NextInvestigations into the shooting continue after 22-year-old Tyler Robinson made his first appearance in court via video link on Tuesday where prosecutors announced murder charges against him.Turning Point USA is set to hold a memorial for Kirk at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, on September 21.Update 9/17/25, 11:03 a.m. ET: This article was updated with additional informationUpdate 9/17/25, 12:03 a.m. ET: This article was updated with additional information.
