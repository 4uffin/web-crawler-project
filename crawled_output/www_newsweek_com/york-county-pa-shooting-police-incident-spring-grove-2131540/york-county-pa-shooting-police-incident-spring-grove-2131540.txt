"We grieve for the loss of life of three precious souls who served this county, served this commonwealth, served this country," Shapiro said at a press conference in York following the incident.Attorney General Pamela Bondi called the violence against police "a scourge on our society." She said federal agents were on scene to support local officers.Lieutenant Governor Austin Davis said on X: "Please send prayers to the officers and those involved in the shooting in York County."York County Shooting: What We KnowThe emergency response played out along a rural road in south-central Pennsylvania, where about 30 police vehicles blocked access near a barn, a goat farm, and fields of soybeans and corn. Officers kept bystanders at a distance as the investigation unfolded.Authorities have not released the names of the shooter, the officers, or their department, and declined to detail how the killings occurred, citing the ongoing investigation. Shapiro said he and other officials met with the officers' families, who, though grieving, expressed pride in their loved ones' service."We need to do better as a society," Shapiro said. "We need to help the people who think that picking up a gun, picking up a weapon is the answer to resolving disputes. We need do better when it comes to mental health."We need to do better when it comes to looking out for those who are in need, so we don't have to deal with tragedies like this," he said.Ted Czech, public information officer for the York County Office of Emergency Management, told local news outlet WHTM that a call came into 911 at 2:10 p.m. local time for an incident in the areas of Haar Road and Senft Road in North Codorus Township, which is south of York.Czech told WHTM that it is an active scene with police and EMS responding."Pennsylvania State Police, Northern Regional Police and numerous emergency responders are at the scene. The York County Commissioners are monitoring the situation closely and praying for all those involved," the county said in a statement obtained by the Associated Press.Newsweek reached out to the York County Office of Emergency Management and York County Sheriff's Office for additional information and comment.Spring Grove Area School District sheltered students in the buildings because of the officer-involved incident that is unrelated to the students or schools, according to a statement from the district obtained by York Daily Record.The Consulate of Mexico in Philadelphia said in a social media post that it is "monitoring the incident" in Pennsylvania and advised Mexican residents nearby to follow official instructions.The region of south-central Pennsylvania is an apple-growing area that attracts migrant farm workers, including many from Mexico.A spokesperson for the consulate told the Associated Press that the post was "only a precautionary alert for our community."What People Are SayingPennsylvania State Police Commissioner Christopher Paris, pledged a full, fair investigation, "The grief will be unbearable but we will bear it."Representative Lloyd Smucker, on X: "Closely monitoring breaking news reports of police officers being injured responding to an incident in York County. Please join me in praying for our first responders and all involved."Pennsylvania Attorney General Dave Sunday, on X: "I am aware of the ongoing situation in York County. I urge all residents to follow the instructions of local law enforcement. I am en route to the area and am praying for all involved."Shapiro said on X earlier on Wednesday, "I've been briefed on the situation involving law enforcement in York County, and am on my way there now. We ask those in the area to please follow the directions of local law enforcement and @PAStatePolice."
