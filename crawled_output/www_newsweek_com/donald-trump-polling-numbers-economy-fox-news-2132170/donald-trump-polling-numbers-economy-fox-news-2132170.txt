President Donald Trump told Fox News' Martha MacCallum on Thursday that the network needs to hire a new pollster when he was asked about his recent poor polling on the economy.MacCallum asked during a one-on-one interview on The Story from the United Kingdom, "We do see polling that doesn't poll well in the economy. The recent Fox polling said 52 percent say the economy is worse under this administration. We've got unemployment at the highest rate in four years. Groceries made a big jump in the last term...You're looking forward with these plans that you just talked about, when will people feel that, President Trump?"Trump responded, "Well, when the factories start opening. I mean, right now, we're building them, you know. And Fox polling, I have to tell you, I've told you before, it's the worst polling I've ever had...During the election, they had me winning by a little bit, not by a massive amount. And Fox polling, I've told Rupert Murdoch, go get yourself a new pollster because he stinks. And this is for years now."

Why It MattersThe polling comes after the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported that U.S. employers added just 22,000 jobs last month. The number was down from 79,000 added in July and lower than the 80,000 predicted by economists. Unemployment rose to 4.3 percent last month, the highest rate reported since 2021.The Federal Reserve announced that it will cut its key interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point on Wednesday, amid elevated uncertainty about the economic outlook.What To KnowThe Fox News national survey conducted from September 6 to September 9 found that 52 percent of voters think the Trump administration has made the economy worse. The poll found that 30 percent think the administration has improved the economy, while 18 percent noticed no difference.The survey, conducted under the direction of Beacon Research and Shaw & Company Research, includes responses from 1,004 registered voters randomly selected from a national voter file, according to Fox News. The margin of error for results based on the full sample group is +/- 3 percentage points.During the interview with MacCallum, Trump also said that the economy would be good "probably, in a year or so," as he touted the fact that auto manufacturers are moving back to the U.S. due to his tariff policies.The administration has previously criticized Fox News' polling numbers on the economy.In April, Fox News anchor John Roberts questioned White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller about the network's polling. Roberts said the polling showed Trump "underwater" on the economy, tariffs and inflation."I don't want to make things awkward for you, John, but it is our opinion that Fox News needs to fire its pollster," Miller said.What People Are SayingPresident Donald Trump, during a Fox News interview with Martha MacCallum: "We're going to have numbers like nobody's ever seen before, including jobs."Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducted the Fox News survey with Democrat Chris Anderson, told Fox News: "It's not enough that prices aren't rising. They need to come down. If not, 2026 will be a bad year for the GOP."What Happens NextThe economy remains the most important issue to voters, according to the Fox News survey. The poll found that 37 percent of voters think it is the most important issue facing the country today.Immigration and border security were viewed as most important by 13 percent of voters. The issues of health care and political division were each viewed as most important by 11 percent of voters, with all other issues in the single digits.Do you have a story that Newsweek should be covering?
