British police have arrested three people on suspicion of assisting Russian intelligence services, highlighting the threat posed to NATO allies as they accuse Russia of pursuing hybrid warfare against Western powers.Newsweek has contacted the Russian embassy in the U.K. for comment.The arrests also coincide with U.S. President Donald Trump's state visit to the U.K., a NATO ally, during which the topic of ending Russia's war in Ukraine is expected to be one of the top agenda items in bilateral talks with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.NATO allies have sounded the alarm over a rising number of Russian intelligence plots to carry out acts of sabotage inside their countries‚Äîsome of which have been successful‚Äîas Moscow and the West clash over the war in Ukraine.Russia denies orchestrating such plots and, in turn, accuses Western allies of espionage and covert actions to undermine Moscow.Essex ArrestsLondon's Metropolitan Police said two men and a woman were arrested at addresses in Essex, a county to the east of the capital. They were not named by police.The three were detained on Wednesday, September 17, by counter-terrorism officers under an investigation into suspected breaches of national security laws by assisting the Russian intelligence services.The men are aged 41 and 46, and the woman is 35 years old. All were released on conditional bail.

Warning on Intelligence 'Proxies'Commander Dominic Murphy, head of the Met's Counter Terrorism Command, said in a statement that "through our recent national security casework, we're seeing an increasing number of who we would describe as 'proxies' being recruited by foreign intelligence services.""Indeed, two young British men are awaiting sentencing after they were recruited by the Wagner Group‚Äîeffectively the Russian state‚Äîto carry out an arson at a Ukrainian-linked warehouse," Murphy said."They are facing potentially lengthy custodial sentences, although, to be clear, today's arrests are in no way connected to that investigation."But anyone who might be contacted by and tempted into carrying out criminal activity on behalf of a foreign state here in the U.K. should think again."This kind of activity will be investigated and anyone found to be involved can expect to be prosecuted and there are potentially very serious consequences for those who are convicted."Lithuania, Latvia Expose Suspected Russian PlotsOn Wednesday, Lithuanian prosecutors said they uncovered and detained a Russia-linked network of suspects who are alleged to have planned and organized arson attacks in various European countries.Lithuania's prosecutor general's office said suspects in a separate case are accused of sending packages containing homemade explosive devices to other European Union countries and Britain via courier services, on behalf of Russia's military intelligence services.The highly flammable incendiary devices with timed detonators were hidden inside vibrating massage cushions and tubes of cosmetics.Lithuanian authorities said a total of 15 people‚Äîcitizens of Russia, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and Ukraine‚Äîare suspected of organizing and carrying out the alleged arson attacks.Their statement said an international arrest warrant has been issued for three people, but did not make clear if and how many people had been arrested.The investigation found that the packages contained thermite‚Äîa highly explosive substance used for industrial and military purposes.Meanwhile, Latvia's security service said it had detained a man suspected of passing intelligence about the military to Russia.The Latvian State Security Service said it had detained a man on suspicion of collecting information about Latvian military sites and passing the information to Russia's intelligence services.In a statement, it said the man provided Russian intelligence with information about NATO troops based in the country, training exercises and the construction of "new military objects."This article includes reporting by The Associated Press.Updated, 9/18/25, 09:07 a.m. ET: This article was updated with more information.
