Tyler Robinson, the Utah man accused of assassinating conservative activist Charlie Kirk, agreed to surrender only under assurances it would be peaceful because he feared being shot by police, a sheriff said Wednesday.Robinson appeared quiet and somber when he arrived with his parents at the Washington County Sheriff's Office last Thursday, a day after Kirk was fatally shot at Utah Valley University, Sheriff Nate Brooksby said."He didn't want a big SWAT team at his parent's house or his apartment," Brooksby said. "He was truly fearful about being shot by law enforcement."

Brooksby said Robinson surrendered voluntarily after learning authorities were searching for him. The sheriff said Robinson was fearful of being killed by police and asked to avoid a SWAT standoff."He knew it was inevitable that he would be caught," Brooksby said Wednesday. "If at the end of the day we accomplish him surrendering peacefully on his own, I'm going to make some concessions to make that happen."Why It MattersThe attack has reverberated far beyond campus. President Donald Trump has vowed to crack down on what he calls the "radical left," while former President Barack Obama said Trump has further divided the nation. In Washington, the House Oversight Committee called executives from Discord, Steam, Twitch and Reddit to testify on how they are policing online extremism.The case has heightened scrutiny on online radicalization, campus security and the nation's political climate as Robinson awaits trial.What To KnowProsecutors on Tuesday charged Robinson, 22, with capital murder in the killing of Kirk and said they will seek the death penalty, citing DNA evidence and incriminating text messages linking him to the shooting. Robinson, who appeared for his first court hearing, was assigned an attorney by a judge after the public defender's office received a request for representation. His family has declined to comment since his arrest.The Sept. 10 assassination at Utah Valley University shocked the nation, deepened political divides and left the campus in mourning. Students returning for the first day of classes this week gathered silently near the barricaded courtyard where Kirk was fatally shot while speaking to students. The school set up care stations with counseling, candy and stuffed animals.Court documents revealed a note left in Robinson's apartment in which he declared, "I had the opportunity to take out Charlie Kirk and I'm going to take it." Texts to his romantic partner, who lived with him, confirmed he was the shooter. "I am, I'm sorry," Robinson wrote after being asked directly if he pulled the trigger. Prosecutors said his DNA was later found on the rifle.Authorities are investigating whether Robinson had help planning the attack. His partner, identified as transgender, shared the incriminating texts with investigators but did not initially go to law enforcement. Robinson remained at large for more than a day until his parents recognized him in a photo released by authorities and persuaded him to surrender. Utah Valley University is reviewing campus security procedures, President Astrid S. Tuminez said.A motive remains unclear. Prosecutors say Robinson texted his partner that he had "enough of [Kirk's] hatred," adding, "Some hate can't be negotiated out." Investigators are examining whether Kirk's outspoken anti-transgender views played a role.Kirk, 31, a father of two, was widely credited with mobilizing young evangelicals through his group Turning Point USA and helping Trump recapture the White House in 2024.Robinson's mother told investigators her son had become increasingly left-leaning over the past year, growing more supportive of gay and transgender rights. She and her husband recognized him in surveillance images of the shooter and confronted him. Robinson reportedly said he wanted to kill himself.Texts later released by authorities showed Robinson describing efforts to retrieve his rifle from a "drop point" that had been locked down after the shooting. He told his partner to delete the messages.What People Are SayingRobinson allegedly wrote to his partner, "To be honest I had hoped to keep this secret till I died of old age. I am sorry to involve you."Matthew Caldwell, 24, a student at the university, said, "The way that we treat each other in our words can ultimately lead to things like this."What Happens NextRobinson's next hearing is scheduled for September 29.This article includes reporting by the Associated Press.
