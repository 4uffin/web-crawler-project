Speakers for Charlie Kirk's memorial service have been announced ahead of his planned funeral this weekend to honor the conservative activist and Turning Point USA co-founder.Kirk, 31, was gunned down September 10 on the campus of Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah, during a live question and answer session with students, in front of thousands.Why It MattersThe memorial is expected to draw thousands and several high-profile conservative figures, underscoring Kirk's influence on modern Republican organizing and the national attention on political violence after his killing.Last week's deadly shooting also heightens concerns of university safety protocols and security at public events.Kirk was a staunch ally of President Donald Trump and a notable younger voice and advocate of the MAGA movement, with a large social media following.What To KnowIn a post to X, Trump War Room announced the speakers for Kirk's Sunday memorial service to be held at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.The List of Announced Speakers Includes:Charlie Kirk's widow, Erika KirkPresident TrumpVice President JD VanceWhite House Chief of Staff Susie WilesSecretary of State Marco RubioHealth and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

The service is open to the public but requires online registration on the event site.The memorial will also be livestreamed on Kirk's Rumble account."Expect TSA-level screening. Clear bags only. No bags larger than 12" by 6" will be permitted in the venue. Strollers are not allowed into the arena," the website says.What People Are SayingFightForCharlie.com in part: "Charlie died doing what he loved: fighting for truth, for faith, for family, and for America. His sacrifice will endure as a guiding light for generations. Though our hearts are heavy, we do not grieve as those without hope. Charlie's legacy endures in his family, in Turning Point USA and Turning Point Action, and in the millions he inspired to live with conviction. We honor him not only with our words, but with our actions. We will move forward together, fighting harder, standing taller, and refusing to surrender.
"Charlie's life was short, but it was full. It was defined by truth, anchored in faith, and devoted to the country he loved. His legacy will endure for generations. And now he hears the words of Matthew 25:23 from his Lord and Savior: 'Well done, good and faithful servant.'"Donald Trump Jr. on X last week: "We will never ever forget Charlie."What Happens NextInvestigations into the shooting continue as police identified 22-year-old Tyler Robinson as a suspect.Robinson made his first appearance in court on Tuesday where prosecutors announced murder charges against him.
