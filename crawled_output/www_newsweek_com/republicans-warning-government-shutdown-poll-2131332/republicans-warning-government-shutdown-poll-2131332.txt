A majority of Americans would blame President Donald Trump and Republicans for a government shutdown, according to a new poll, but one expert told Newsweek, in part, that the poll's findings aren't "terribly surprising."Republican National Committee Communications Director Zach Parkinson told Newsweek that Democrats are "willing to shut down the government just to appease their far-left base."Why It MattersCongress is facing an end-of-the-month deadline to pass a budget bill to fund the federal government or face a shutdown. The impacts of a shutdown are myriad‚Äîhundreds of thousands of federal workers may be unpaid or furloughed during the shutdown, and there can be disruptions to passport processing applications, national parks and government benefits.There are also fiscal impacts‚Äîa shutdown that lasted from December 2018 through January 2019 led to a 0.1 percent reduction in GDP growth, according to a Congressional Budget Office report.There may be political effects, as well, ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, when Democrats are hoping for a 2018-style blue wave to help them flip control of the House, Senate and governorships across the country. If Americans become outraged over a prolonged shutdown, that could be a challenge for Republicans as they find themselves on the defensive.

What To KnowThe latest poll from Data for Progress found that nearly six in 10 American voters would blame the GOP or Trump for a shutdown, not Democrats.In total, 32 percent said they would blame Trump, while 27 percent said they would blame Republicans in Congress if the government shuts down. Only 34 percent said they would blame Democrats.Among independents‚Äîa critical voting bloc‚Äî30 percent would blame Trump, while 24 percent would blame congressional Republicans. Thirty-one percent would place blame on Democrats, according to the poll.The poll also asked about how voters would like to see Democrats approach the spending battle.Sixty-six percent of Democrats, 73 percent of Democratic-leaning independents and 47 percent of persuadable voters said the party is "not doing enough to stand up to Donald Trump and his administration and needs to fight harder." Meanwhile, 30 percent of Democrats, 24 percent of Democratic-leaning independents and 35 percent of persuadable voters said the Democrats "could do a better job resisting" Trump but are overall "doing a decent job."The poll surveyed 654 likely voters from September 5-7 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.Costas Panagopoulos, political scientist at Northeastern University, told Newsweek the poll is not particularly surprising."It's not terribly surprising given that voters are aware that Republicans control the levers of the federal government right now," he said. "Whatever actions the government takes or fails to take are going to be attributed to the majority party, so it's not terribly surprising."How major a political issue the shutdown becomes depends on how long it lasts and how disruptive it is to both ordinary workers and federal workers, he said. Shutdowns that last longer will have more of a political impact than those that are quickly resolved, he said.It could also "certainly become a challenge anywhere there are a large number of federal employees," he said."Trump and Republicans will try to blame Democrats, but that will be a very difficult case to make for Americans who are aware that the federal government is now controlled by Republicans," Panagopoulos said.Republicans control both chambers of Congress, as well as the White House. But the party's slim margin of control has created challenges for the party in the past in the House, as any bill would need to satisfy both the most conservative members of Congress as well as moderates representing districts won by former Vice President Kamala Harris last year.The funding bill would also require 60 votes in the Senate, meaning Democrats are looking for some concessions to support it.Earlier this year, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York and other Democrats voted to advance a stopgap measure to temporarily fund the government. But Democratic voters felt he did not secure meaningful concessions and called for his ouster as Senate minority leader. Democrats will be hoping to avoid similar backlash from the base this time around, while also hoping to strike a deal to prevent a shutdown.Schumer said on MSNBC Wednesday morning that Democrats plan to introduce an alternative continuing resolution that would address concerns around issues like healthcare."We need to have a bipartisan bill. The Democrats have been frozen out, there is no input. Every time you pass‚Äîor just about every time you pass‚Äîa successful CR, the two parties sit together and come to conclusion," he said.

What People Are SayingRNC Communications Director Zach Parkinson, in a statement to Newsweek: "Democrats have failed to accomplish anything for the last eight months, so now they are willing to shut down the government just to appease their far-left base. They're threatening a shutdown to abolish ICE and stop the President's America First Agenda, even if it means risking veterans' care, military pay, and funding for law enforcement and Border Patrol. That's not leadership, it's sabotage."Data for Progress, in a polling memo: "If a government shutdown occurs on October 1, a majority of voters (59%) would place the blame on Trump (32%) or congressional Republicans (27%). Data for Progress asked Democratic base voters ‚Äî voters who identify as Democrats and Independents who lean Democratic ‚Äî as well as persuadable voters, about the upcoming government shutdown fight. These voters were asked whether the Democratic Party is overall doing a decent job resisting Trump, or if it is not doing enough and needs to fight harder. Strong majorities of Democrats (66%) and Democratic-leaning Independents (73%), as well as a plurality of persuadable voters (47%), believe the Democratic Party is not doing enough to stand up to Trump and needs to fight harder."Senate Republicans, on X: "A fight with the President and a government shutdown may be good for Senator Schumer's career, but it's terrible for America."Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, on X: "Senator Thune can say what he wants‚Äîlike saying I haven't asked him to meet or he hasn't heard from me But we've asked to meet for SIX WEEKS, OVER AND OVER AGAIN Senator Thune and Speaker Johnson are just taking their marching orders from Trump And Trump wants a shutdown."What Happens NextCongress has until 11:59 p.m. September 30 to reach a deal to avoid the shutdown.Update 9/17/25, 4:45 p.m. ET: This article was updated with additional information.
