Haifa Smoked Fish is recalling specific lots of its cold smoked salmon and cold smoked sea bass due to fears the products may be contaminated with Listeria Monocytogenes.Newsweek reached out to the company via phone call on Wednesday and left a voicemail.Why It MattersNumerous public health alerts and recalls have been initiated this year because of the potential for damaged products, foodborne illness, contamination and undeclared food allergens.Millions of Americans experience food sensitivities or allergies. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the nine "major" food allergens in the United States are eggs, milk, fish, wheat, soybeans, crustacean shellfish, sesame, tree nuts and peanuts.The FDA warns that listeria could cause "serious and sometimes fatal infections" in older adults, young children and those with weakened immune systems.What To KnowIn the alert, the company notes that the products were distributed across the country via retail stores and distributors.The cold smoked salmon impacted by the recall was sold in 8-ounce packaging, with lot number 219. The cold smoked sea bass associated with the recall was also sold in 8-ounce packaging, with lot number 212.The product was vacuum-packaged on "paper board with flexible plastic," the alert notes.There have been no reported illnesses related to this recall as of Tuesday, the alert says.

What People Are SayingThe alert, in part: "The contamination was discovered after sampling by New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets Food Inspectors and subsequent analysis of Food Laboratory personnel revealed the presence of Listeria monocytogenes in the Haifa" COLD SMOKED SALMON" 8 OZ., LOT # 219 and "COLD SMOKED SEABASS" 8 OZ., LOT # 212."In an email to Newsweek in January, the FDA said: "Most recalls in the U.S. are carried out voluntarily by the product manufacturer and when a company issues a public warning, typically via news release, to inform the public of a voluntary product recall, the FDA shares that release on our website as a public service."The FDA's role during a voluntary, firm-initiated, recall is to review the recall strategy, evaluate the health hazard presented by the product, monitor the recall, and as appropriate alert the public and other companies in the supply chain about the recall."The FDA provides public access to information on recalls by posting a listing of recalls according to their classification in the FDA Enforcement Report, including the specific action taken by the recalling company. The FDA Enforcement Report is designed to provide a public listing of products in the marketplace that are being recalled."Additional information on recalls can be found via the FDA's Recalls, Market Withdrawals, & Safety Alerts.What Happens NextPeople who have purchased the recalled products are urged to return them to the original place of purchase for a refund, the alert notes.Customers with additional questions may contact Haifa Smoked Fish via phone at 718-523-8899.
