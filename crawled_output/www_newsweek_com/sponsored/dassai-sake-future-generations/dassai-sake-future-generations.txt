Space: The final frontier. Stardate 2044. On Japan's first lunar colony, a solitary astronaut drifts through the low gravity. Fatigued from a long shift, he steadfastly stands guard over humanity's great experiment. He bounces through the air lock, removes his suit with practiced ease and enters the crew's common room, where laughter, soft music and camaraderie fill the space. A crewmate smiles. "Otsukaresama," someone says, reaching for a bottle of DASSAI Moon, the first sake brewed in microgravity in 2025, and pours him a cup. In that moment, DASSAI is a connection that carries tradition to the stars.But how did this ancient Japanese tradition reach orbit? Who imagined sake, once poured in mountain villages, could travel beyond earth? What vision preserves cultural identity while venturing into the unknown?Local roots, global visionThe story begins in 1948, in the secluded mountains of Yamaguchi prefecture. Asahi Shuzo‚Äîtoday known as DASSAI‚Äîwas then a modest brewery making everyday table sake. Relying on seasonal brewers and selling mainly to local shops and restaurants, it struggled when Japan's sake market peaked in 1974.1 of 2

Hiroshi Sakurai, the third-generation head and current chairman, made a bold move: he expanded into the markets of Tokyo and other major cities. To compete, he didn't rely on the conventional sales approaches of his peers, choosing instead to let the quality of his sake speak for itself.He embarked on a challenge that the brewery had never attempted before: brewing Junmai Daiginjo. Simultaneously, he strove to create a market that barely existed for such high-quality sake. What followed was a relentless journey of trial and error. President and CEO Kazuhiro Sakurai reflects on his father's decision: "We embrace change and innovation because making delicious sake was essential for our survival." This mindset transformed the brewery, guiding it to become a world-renowned sake producer that now focuses exclusively on Junmai Daiginjo. "It was that decision‚Äîto prioritize taste over salesmanship‚Äîthat led to our greatest success," the chairman says.Quality: the competitive difference While ingredients like water and rice are essential, the skill and care of the brewers play an even greater role compared to that required for beverages like wine. Like chefs, they transform raw materials into something truly exceptional. A key step is rice polishing: removing the outer layers, which contain proteins and fats, to use only the inner core. This precision allows brewers to control fermentation and craft sake with clean sweetness and vibrant aroma. DASSAI 23 stands as the true embodiment of that philosophy. "It ideally expresses the fragrance of white flowers and fruits, with a clear, luscious sweetness‚Äîperfect even for first-time sake drinkers," says the president.

Innovation extends beyond quality. Twenty years ago, DASSAI was one of the first small breweries to begin expanding overseas. At a time when sake was seen only as a strong spirit or served hot, this was a bold effort to create a market for high-quality sake. Wherever people enjoyed DASSAI, the brewery embraced a clear mission: bringing happiness through delicious sake.Reimagining tradition abroadDASSAI's push overseas revealed challenges rooted in long-held misconceptions: that sake pairs with only sushi, tempura or sashimi, or that it is meant to be enjoyed only hot. Determined to break free of these notions, the company constructed a brewery in New York. Through the company's partnership with the Culinary Institute of America (CIA), it set out to bring sake to a broader audience and share the joy that flows from discovering it anew.New York's water is mineral-rich compared to the Nishiki River, making it impossible to replicate Japanese methods. Rather than simply copying Japan, New York takes a new approach and embraces the different environment. The result is DASSAI Blue, an original sake.1 of 2

Constant adaptation and experimentation are key, and this process continues to this day. President Sakurai takes great pride in seeing the American staff approach their work with such sincerity and dedication.Efforts to broaden sake culture extend beyond brewing. Partnering with French chef Yannick All√©no, the company opened a restaurant in France to showcase sake alongside seasonal cuisine from around the world. "This kind of culinary partnership offers another meaningful way to introduce sake into global food culture," says the president.Sake traditions and the future of humanityThe philosophy and aesthetics born from DASSAI's global journey now reach into space. If humanity is to explore new frontiers, sake should be part of that story. This vision gave rise to the "DASSAI Moon" challenge. In 2025, inside Japan's Kibo module on the International Space Station, DASSAI will become the first sake, and likely the first alcoholic beverage, ever brewed beyond earth.

"Sake has the power to bring people together, to bring joy and to enrich the human experience," says the president. The challenge is part of the continuum of human history‚Äîan effort to carry culture, traditions and social bonds into the future. Just as the astronaut carries tradition into the stars with a cup of DASSAI Moon, so, too, does the president pass forward a legacy grounded in reverence and reinvention.As the sake flows on the moon, he envisions his own son inheriting not just a company but a mission to preserve tradition while daring to evolve it. "I hope my son will, just like his father and I, and even building on our efforts, pursue growth without fear of trial and error." Whether in the mountains of Japan, anywhere on earth or on the moon‚Äîeach time a cup is filled, the spirit of DASSAI lives on.For more details, explore the website at https://dassai.com/us/.Alternatively, you can learn more about the "DASSAI Moon" challenge here: https://dassai.com/thestage/en/index.html.All interviews were conducted by The Worldfolio and can be found at www.theworldfolio.com.This report has been paid for by a third party.
