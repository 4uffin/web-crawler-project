President Donald Trump and King Charles praised the British-American alliance as they spoke at the grand state banquet at Windsor Castle in the U.K. on Wednesday.
During his toast, King Charles paid tribute to the centuries-long alliance between the United Kingdom and the United States, noting that "our people have fought and died together for the values we hold dear."
Trump opened his remarks by calling it a "singular privilege" to be the first American president to receive two state visits to the U.K. "Maybe it will be the last time‚ÄîI hope it is, actually," he joked. He closed by offering a toast, "On behalf of all Americans" to "one of the great friendships, two great countries, and to His Majesty, King Charlies III ‚Äî a very, very special man and also a very, very special Queen."
While Trump received a lavish welcome from Britain's royal family, a very different reception unfolded on the streets of London where demonstrators held up "Go home Trump" signs and marched in protest of his visit.

Rupert Murdoch attended royal dinner for Trump despite Epstein lawsuit
Rupert Murdoch attended the British royal state dinner for President Donald Trump Wednesday, despite Trump's $20 billion Jeffrey Epstein lawsuit.
Trump is suing Murdoch, the owner of the Wall Street Journal, after the newspaper published a report stating that the president had sent the convicted pedophile a birthday letter and drawing of a feminine figure.
Trump has denied sending the letter, and denied that it was his signature at the bottom of the note, and said at the time that he had personally warned Murdoch he'd sue if the Journal went ahead and published.
When the Journal went to press anyway, Trump filed a lawsuit seeking billions in damages and a testimony from Murdoch.
The royal family are responsible for the seating arrangements at the state dinner and appear to have tactfully seated the media mogul far away from the president to avoid any awkward encounters.

Princess Kate wore Diana's tiara to state banquet honoring Trump
Catherine, Princess of Wales, wore her late mother-in-law's tiara to the state banquet at Windsor Castle on Wednesday.
The tiara, known as the Lover's Knot, was a favorite of Princess Diana's, royal jewelry expert Lauren Kiehna, told Yahoo.
The piece was created for Queen Mary in 1914 by the House of Garrard, using pearls and diamonds already owned by the royal family.
Mary modeled after her grandmother Princess Augusta of Hesse's tiara, known as the Cambridge Lover's Knot Tiara, which is believed to be held in an unknown private collection.
Queen Elizabeth II inherited it after Mary's death and was often seen wearing it, before she gave it to Diana.

King Charles referenced war in Ukraine during speech
King Charles III referenced the Russian war in Ukraine during his speech, as he celebrated the longstanding alliance between the U.S. and the U.K.
"In two World Wars, we fought together to defeat the forces of tyranny," Charles said at Windsor Castle.
"Today, as tyranny once again threatens Europe, we and our allies stand together in support of Ukraine."
President Donald Trump had vowed, during his 2024 presidential campaign, to end the war in Ukraine on day one of his return to office. However, he has since conceded the issue was more complex than he first thought after his negotiations with Russian President Vladimir Putin failed to achieve lasting peace.
However, Charles praised Trump's efforts to secure peace.
"Our countries are working together in support of crucial diplomatic efforts, no least of which, Mr. President, is your own personal commitment to finding solutions to some of the world's most intractable conflicts, in order to secure peace."

Trump did not go off script during his banquet speech
President Trump appeared to stick to the script as he addressed the King, other royals, politicians and business leaders at the banquet.
Referring to the bond between the U.K. and U.S., Trump said that the phrase "special relationship... does not begin to do it justice".
He also focused on the countries' shared history, language, culture and ancestry.
Unlike many of Trump's speeches, which have a tendency to meander, Trump almost entirely stuck to the topic of U.K.-U.S. relations.
Only one or two off the cuff moments broke through, including when he announced he'd made America "the hottest country in the world" since he returned to office.

Trump also praised Prince William and Princess Kate, who he and Melania spent time with earlier today, calling Kate, "so radiant and so healthy, so beautiful."

Air traffic controller scolds Spirit pilot near Air Force One over NY
A Spirit Airlines pilot received a sharp rebuke from an air traffic controller Tuesday morning after flying too close to Air Force One, which was carrying President Donald Trump to the United Kingdom.

Republic joins anti-Trump protest, linking monarchy and authoritarianism
Republic, the UK-based campaign group advocating for the abolition of the monarchy, joined demonstrators in London protesting President Donald Trump's state visit. The group's spokesperson, Graham Smith, drew a direct parallel between Trump and King Charles III, calling them "corrupt billionaires with a distaste for democracy."
Smith criticized Trump's record on constitutional norms and warned that similar concerns apply to the UK's own head of state. "Charles is exempted from hundreds of laws and shies away from scrutiny and accountability," he said. The group's message‚Äî"corrupt billionaires are not the answer"‚Äîwas echoed throughout the march.
Referencing U.S. protests earlier this year under the slogan "No Kings," Smith added: "It's time to fix our democracy and defend the country from those who might want to undermine what democratic rights we have, whether that be Charles or Trump. No Kings Here. No Kings There. No Kings Anywhere."

Did Donald Trump break royal protocol in front of King Charles? What to know
President Donald Trump was criticized for "walking [in front] of the king, like Charles doesn't even exist or matter" during his state visit to Britain‚Äîthough Newsweek understands he followed the intended order.
The U.S. president was welcomed to Windsor Castle by King Charles III and was treated to a royal carriage procession and official welcome ceremony.
The pair inspected a guard of honor together, and Charles was filmed walking alone some distance behind Trump, prompting comments on social media.

But a royal source told Newsweek it is protocol for the visiting head of state to always go first.
Elsewhere, some U.K. newspapers accused Trump of breaching protocol by slapping William on the arm when he shook his hand.

Royals and Rubio explore U.S.-U.K. history at Windsor exhibition
At Windsor Castle's Royal Collection exhibition, the Prince and Princess of Wales joined U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio to view historic artifacts tracing the evolution of Anglo-American relations. Among the items was George III's 1784 essay America is Lost, prompting Kate to reflect on "the storytelling behind it," and joke about how different such correspondence would be if written over email.
Prince William drew laughter with a quip about "all the emails being laid out," while admiring a long white ticker tape message sent by Queen Victoria to President James Buchanan in 1858. The message, transmitted via the first transatlantic cable, marked a milestone in diplomatic communication.
William leaned in for a closer look and remarked, "The whole message ‚Äì wow." The exhibit's blend of political history and technological innovation offered a pointed nod to modern forms of messaging‚Äîperhaps even tailored to catch the attention of President Trump, known for his prolific use of social media.

As Trump is feted with a royal ceremony in the English countryside, a stark contrast is unfolding in London, where thousands are protesting his presence in the United Kingdom. Hosted at Windsor Castle rather than the traditional Buckingham Palace‚Äîofficially under renovation‚ÄîTrump's engagements have largely kept him out of public view and away from the capital's dissenting crowds.
The optics are deliberate. While King Charles III leads a day of military honors and private tours, activists in London march through the city and project images of Trump alongside Jeffrey Epstein onto Windsor Castle's walls. According to YouGov, just 16% of Britons hold a favorable view of Trump, underscoring the political sensitivity surrounding the visit.

Fortnum & Mason tea sales hit by U.S. tariffs amid Trump's UK visit
As President Donald Trump visits the United Kingdom for a state visit, British retailer Fortnum & Mason is reporting a steep decline in U.S. tea sales due to recent American trade measures. CEO Tom Athron told the Financial Times that changes to country-of-origin rules and the removal of the "de minimis" exemption‚Äîpreviously allowing duty-free entry for goods under $800‚Äîhave driven up costs for American consumers.
A 250g canister of Royal Blend tea now costs at least $25.41 to ship to the U.S., nearly matching the product's retail price. Athron explained that new tariffs apply if any tea blend contains leaves from China or India, regardless of where it's processed. "The American authorities have told us‚Äîthis is the tea industry in its entirety‚Äîthat if you've got tea from China or India in your tea, then it is country of origin China or India, and therefore those enormous tariffs apply," he said.
Despite blending and packing its teas in Newcastle, England, Fortnum's is subject to the broader tariff regime introduced by Trump in April, which includes a 10% baseline on UK imports. While a bilateral trade deal was announced in May, key details remain unresolved.

Trump views historic U.S.-U.K. artifacts in Windsor's green drawing room
After a private lunch in Windsor Castle's State Dining Room, President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump joined King Charles III and Queen Camilla for a tour of a specially curated exhibition in the Green Drawing Room, showcasing rare items from the Royal Collection that trace the deep-rooted ties between the United States and the United Kingdom.
Among the highlights was a first edition of The General Historie of Virginia by John Smith, detailing early English settlements in North America, including Jamestown and the arrival of the Mayflower. The palace noted the volume includes a dramatized account of Smith's interactions with Pocahontas.
Also on display was a 1774 letter from King George III to Prime Minister Lord North, acknowledging the escalating rebellion in the American colonies and referencing the Boston Tea Party as a pivotal moment in deteriorating relations.
Completing the exhibit was an 1858 tickertape message from Queen Victoria to U.S. President James Buchanan, sent via the newly laid transatlantic cable. In it, Victoria expressed hope that the technological breakthrough would "prove an additional link between the nations, whose friendship is founded upon their common interest and reciprocal esteem."

Human rights lawyer urges broader security commitments for Ukraine during Trump visit
As President Donald Trump continues his state visit to the United Kingdom, human rights advocates are urging leaders to expand security commitments to Ukraine beyond military aid. Wayne Jordash KC, President of Global Rights Compliance, emphasized that any guarantees must include institutional support to prevent future atrocities.
"Any discussions on security guarantees for Ukraine during President Trump's visit to the UK this week must not be limited to military commitments or 'boots on the ground' pledges," Jordash said in a statement shared with Newsweek. "They must also critically build resilience into Ukraine's institutions and legal system to ensure that Russia is never again able to invade and commit atrocities."
Global Rights Compliance's Mobile Justice Teams work alongside Ukraine's Office of the Prosecutor General to document and prosecute war crimes. Jordash added that support must include "unwavering support for the pursuit of accountability for the horrific crimes endured by civilians and prisoners of war," citing sexual violence, starvation tactics, and the forced abduction of children by Russian forces.

The march is expected to proceed through key areas of the city and conclude outside the Houses of Parliament. Authorities have confirmed that more than 1,500 police officers will be deployed to manage the event and ensure public safety amid heightened tensions.

President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Keir Starmer have yet to meet during Trump's state visit to the United Kingdom, but their first encounter is expected at tonight's state banquet at Windsor Castle. Formal talks will follow tomorrow at Chequers, the prime minister's country residence, where both leaders are set to discuss trade, technology, and global security.
Starmer has invested heavily in building a working relationship with Trump, stressing their shared appeal to voters seeking change. Trump, reportedly impressed by Labour's sweeping electoral victory, has expressed admiration for Starmer's political success. But the prime minister enters the talks under pressure: new polling from YouGov shows his favorability at just 21%, with a record-high 71% of Britons viewing him unfavorably‚Äîa net rating of -50.
Despite the optics, British officials are focused on the substance of Thursday's meeting. Matthew Doyle, a former adviser to Starmer, described the visit as a strategic blend of ceremony and diplomacy. "There is always a kind of unofficial quid pro quo on these trips between the ceremonial and the substance," Doyle told CNN, noting that Trump's fondness for royal pageantry is being leveraged to secure meaningful outcomes.
Talks at Chequers are expected to include announcements on tech and trade partnerships, with major U.S. CEOs in attendance. British officials also hope Trump will outline a strategy for engaging Russia diplomatically, with Ukraine topping the foreign policy agenda. For Starmer, the challenge is clear: deliver results while navigating a domestic approval crisis.

Green Party leader Zack Polanski to address anti-Trump rally in Westminster
Zack Polanski, newly elected leader of the Green Party of England and Wales, is set to speak at an anti-Trump rally in Westminster this afternoon, joining demonstrators opposed to President Donald Trump's state visit. In remarks shared ahead of the event, Polanski accused Trump of seeking legitimacy through royal pageantry while ignoring global humanitarian crises.
Polanski specifically condemned Trump's stance on Gaza, describing the visit as an attempt to "whitewash his own complicity" in the ongoing conflict. He also criticized Nigel Farage, calling him a political opportunist aligned with Trump's pursuit of power and wealth.
Framing the protest as part of Britain's tradition of defending the vulnerable, Polanski urged solidarity with children in Gaza, migrants in U.S. detention centers, and those facing poverty in the U.K.

Mixed reactions in Windsor as Trump's state visit sparks patriotism, protest, and press
From Jack Royston, Newsweek reporter on the ground in Windsor
Joseph Afrane, 61, from Battersea, London, turned out in Windsor covered in British and American flags from head to toe, including on his sunglasses, and told Newsweek: "The visit is paying off.
"It is good for the economy in Windsor, the businesses are booming, look how many people are here. The hotels and restaurants, bars, they are going to benefit. All their revenues will go up.
"Trump loves his country, he loves America, and he's delivering his manifesto with his slogan, America First."
Afrane is right that there are small crowds of people outside the Windsor Castle but this is no royal wedding and many of those gathered are journalists.
Trump might have got bigger crowds if the carriage procession had been open to the public, but security concerns were no doubt too pronounced for that.
It is not just the fans who stayed away, though. There were precious few protesters in Windsor, too.
Sheila Dix, 69, went to Windsor from Manchester to protest and has also sent a letter to the king to voice her views.
"The only person who has any chance of influencing Trump is King Charles," she told Newsweek, "because he so, so wants to be in with the royal family. He's already said on the TV, 'he's my friend.'
"Although the king doesn't like to get involved in things politically, how can he have Trump on an unprecedented visit while thousands of people are getting slaughtered in Gaza?
"The cost of the visit to us is astronomical. He's criminal, he's a narcissist, he only cares about himself. Even if he says today he's going to do something wonderful for this country he'll change his mind in the morning."
Stephen, 42, a Windsor local, wore a "Make America Great Again" hat and waved a U.S. flag: "I just came down to see if I could see the President, the leader of the free world. It's a state visit, everybody's out. It's time to celebrate, our closest allies are here.
"I would consider myself a Trump supporter. I think people buy into the media lies too much. I mean, he is so divisive but I think people feed into the media lies a lot."

Trump ally dismisses criticism of UK visit, shrugs off Sadiq Khan's remarks
Bryan Lanza, a former senior adviser to President Donald Trump's campaign, pushed back against claims that Trump's state visit to the United Kingdom lacks public support. Speaking on BBC Radio's "Today" program, Lanza said, "There's obviously opposition, but at the end of the day, those who are opposed, they don't matter. The American people are the ones who voted this president in."
Lanza also dismissed criticism from London Mayor Sadiq Khan, who has repeatedly condemned Trump's political rhetoric and presence in the UK. "Who cares?" Lanza said. "He's just a local mayor. I think he should focus more on traffic and on the trash than trying to elevate himself to the diplomatic stage."

Trump welcomed with largest military ceremony ever staged for a visiting leader in the U.K.
President Donald Trump's arrival at Windsor Castle was marked by the most expansive military pageantry ever assembled for a foreign leader in Britain. The ceremony featured 1,300 personnel and 120 horses, with troops drawn from across the Royal Navy, Royal Marines, British Army, and Royal Air Force.
As King Charles III greeted Trump on the East Lawn, a 41-round gun salute echoed across Windsor‚Äîand simultaneously from the Tower of London, 20 miles away. The carriage procession through the estate was flanked by 80 soldiers from the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment, forming the Sovereign's escort. The Life Guards wore red tunics with white-plumed helmets, while the Blues and Royals donned blue uniforms with red feathered headgear.
The route, closed to the public for security reasons, was lined by 22 half-companies representing all branches of the armed forces. Inside the castle's Quadrangle, Trump was met with the largest guard of honor ever staged for a state visit, each regiment bearing its official colors in a display of military precision and ceremonial grandeur.

Muted arrival in Windsor as Trump begins state visit behind closed gates
From Jack Royston, Newsweek reporter on the ground in Windsor
Donald Trump arrived into an overcast and strangely muted Windsor where the route of his upcoming carriage procession is‚Äîunusually for royal pageantry‚Äîout of bounds to the public behind cast iron gates and security barriers.
Soldiers, rather than royalists, will line the route and even the protesters who oppose his arrival on U.K. soil were not present in significant number, many no doubt choosing London as a better location to express their views.
A Chinook helicopter was the first sign of Trump's arrival followed by two helicopters both resembling Marine One, no doubt helping to make life difficult for any would be attackers.
And with the President safely ensconced behind the castle walls, the royal charm offensive has begun in earnest.

President Donald Trump is in England for a rare second state visit, a diplomatic overture extended by King Charles III and Prime Minister Keir Starmer aimed at reinforcing U.S.-U.K. ties amid global uncertainty. The visit is centered at Windsor Castle.
The invitation carries personal and political weight. In 1988, Trump hosted then-Prince Charles at Mar-a-Lago, and this week's events‚Äîincluding a carriage procession, wreath-laying at Queen Elizabeth II's tomb, and a state banquet‚Äîecho that early connection. British officials see the visit as a way to engage a president whose foreign policy has challenged postwar norms.
Prime Minister Starmer, seeking to build rapport with Trump early in his second term, hopes the royal backdrop will ease negotiations on trade, tech investment, and nuclear energy. Thursday's agenda includes meetings at Chequers with business leaders and a joint press conference. While the royals avoid politics, the diplomatic stakes remain high, with unresolved tensions over Ukraine and lingering controversy surrounding former U.K. ambassador Peter Mandelson's ties to Jeffrey Epstein.

Royal optics and public dissent shape Trump's state visit
Ingrid Seward, royal biographer and author of My Mother and I, described Trump's visit as "high stakes," noting that "the frill on the frock is the royalty" when speaking to Newsweek. She expects Queen Camilla to attend all scheduled events despite recent illness, adding, "Sinusitis is very painful but I think she'll just drug herself up and get through the day."
Public sentiment in Windsor remains divided. Tim Miles, 62, stood near the castle gates wearing a red "Make America Go Away" hat, voicing strong opposition to the visit. "He's making enough of a mess of his own country," Miles told Newsweek. "I don't see why anyone should invite him anywhere else." His remarks reflect broader unease surrounding the optics of hosting Trump, even as the royal family maintains its traditional role in state diplomacy.

UK launches largest security operation in years for Trump state visit
British authorities have activated an expansive security operation ahead of Trump's state visit, marking the most extensive protective deployment since King Charles III's coronation in 2023. The multi-agency effort includes aerial surveillance via drones, sniper teams, mounted patrols, and marine units along the River Thames.
The heightened precautions follow recent incidents of political violence in the U.S., including the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk and a prior assassination attempt targeting Trump. Officials say these events have intensified threat assessments and prompted tighter control over all physical and aerial access points.
Trump arrived in London on Tuesday evening and will be hosted by King Charles and Queen Camilla at Windsor Castle on Wednesday. Thursday's agenda includes closed-door talks with Prime Minister Keir Starmer at Chequers, the prime minister's country estate.
Thames Valley Police confirmed that all events will be held within secured private grounds, with no public-facing appearances, per The New York Times. Assistant Chief Constable Christian Bunt stressed the absence of public access. At the same time, former royal protection officer Simon Morgan noted that planners are "doubling down" to eliminate any potential vantage points for attacks.
To reinforce local forces, armed officers from across England and Wales‚Äîwhere firearm authorization remains rare‚Äîhave been deployed to support the operation.

Queen Camilla to attend Trump state visit despite health concerns
Queen Camilla will participate in Wednesday's state events at Windsor Castle as U.S. President Donald Trump begins his second official visit to the United Kingdom, Buckingham Palace confirmed. Her attendance had been uncertain following her abrupt withdrawal from the funeral of the Duchess of Kent on Tuesday due to acute sinusitis.

The scene in Windsor ahead of Trump visit
It is raining in Windsor as the ancient town west of London prepares to receive President Trump.
Much of the state visit will happen in private to ensure the security of Trump and other high-profile people, and to neutralize the threat of mass protests derailing what the British government hopes is‚Äîand needs to be‚Äîa smooth and positive event.
Still, a number of protesters and supporters are there in the wet weather to greet Trump.
