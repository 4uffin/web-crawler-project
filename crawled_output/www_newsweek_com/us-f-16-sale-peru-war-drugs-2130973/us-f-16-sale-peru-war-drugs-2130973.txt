The United States has approved the potential sale of F-16 fighter jets to Peru to support the South American country's counternarcotics and counterterrorism operations.This proposed sale will contribute to U.S. foreign policy objectives by improving the security of Peru, which is a force for political stability, peace and economic progress in South America, the U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) said in a press release.Why It MattersOn Monday, Peru was declared by the U.S. as one of the major drug transit or major illicit drug-producing countries for 2026. According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the South American country is among the world's top three producers of coca bush‚Äîthe plant from which coca leaves are processed to produce cocaine.The arms sale approval comes as the U.S. military maintains a strong presence in the Caribbean as part of its war against the cartels, targeting Venezuela. President Donald Trump warned Caracas against sending drugs and "prisoners" into the U.S., calling the country's cartels a threat to U.S. national security, foreign policy and vital interests.

What To KnowThe DSCA, which is responsible for building the capacity of foreign forces, said on Monday that Peru's request to purchase 10 F-16C Block 70 and two F-16D Block 70 aircraft had been approved by the State Department.In addition to the aircraft fleet, this possible sale includes 14 F110-GE-129 fighter jet engines, 12 AIM-120C-8 and 12 AIM-9X Block II air-to-air missiles, as well as 12 M61A1 anti-aircraft guns, for an estimated cost of $3.42 billion.The fighter jets will enhance the Peruvian air force's ability to conduct precision air-to-ground attack operations in support of ground forces in counternarcotics and counterterrorism operations, the DSCA said.The proposed sale will not alter the basic military balance in South America, nor will it have any adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness, the agency noted, adding that it also delivered the required certification notifying Congress of this possible sale.According to U.S. defense company Lockheed Martin, the Block 70 is the newest and most advanced variant of the F-16 family of fighter jets, providing greater radar capabilities, enhanced battlespace awareness and "unmatched" weapon integration.While the proposed sale remains subject to change, as noted by defense outlet The War Zone, Peru is set to become the fourth F-16 jet operator in South America, following Venezuela, Chile and Argentina, according to a Lockheed Martin document.Venezuela received a fleet of 16 F-16A Block 15 and eight F-16B Block 15 jets in the 1980s when it maintained good relations with the U.S., according to The War Zone. However, only a few of its U.S.-made jets have remained in active service in recent years.What People Are SayingThe U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency said in a press release on Monday: "The sale will also enhance Peru's military partnership with the United States on an enduring long-term basis. Peru will have no difficulty absorbing these articles and services into its armed forces."Lockheed Martin wrote in a document: "The F-16 delivers advanced air dominance capabilities to our customers, enabling peace through strength. With a proven track record, the F-16 fosters long-standing strategic relationships with America and its allies, bolstering deterrence and peacekeeping missions worldwide."What Happens NextIt remains to be seen whether the U.S. will approve additional arms sales to other Latin American allies and partners as part of its efforts to strengthen regional relations.
