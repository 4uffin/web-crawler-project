They were leaders within our agency, committed to protecting this community and standing beside their follow officers," Chief Dave Lash said.Pennsylvania Police Shooting: What We KnowAuthorities say Ruth ambushed officers who came to arrest him at his ex-girlfriend's home in rural York County on Wednesday afternoon. Police opened the unlocked door around 2:10 p.m. and were met with gunfire from Ruth, who was armed with an AR-style rifle fitted with a suppressor, according to Barker.Officials said Ruth fired multiple rounds at the four officers at the door.

A trail camera image also appeared to show Ruth outside the property with a rifle and scope.Ruth eluded police that night, leading them to return Wednesday with misdemeanor warrants for his arrest. The young woman's car had been set on fire in August and she said she suspected he may have been involved.Further details on the domestic dispute are expected as investigators process evidence removed from the area around Ruth's home.Rose Miller, who lives a few doors down, said investigators first arrived around noon Wednesday and returned later in the afternoon.
