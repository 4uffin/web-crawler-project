Florida Governor Ron DeSantis issued a new warning to students after the New College of Florida announced that they are commissioning a statue of Charlie Kirk after his killing last week.Why It MattersThe New College of Florida's decision intersects with national conversations about political memorials, campus free-speech protections and responses to political violence following Kirk's September 10 assassination while he spoke at Utah Valley University.Kirk, 31, was a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump and a face of MAGA for younger generations. Kirk utilized his social media platforms to engage with younger people and discuss topics related to the culture war, foreign policy, religion, and other conservative values.The Turning Point USA co-founder and CEO was shot during a live question-and-answer session last week in front of thousands of people on a college campus.

Go ahead, make my day!"Kirk's death sent shock waves through the United States as lawmakers, celebrities and community leaders called for action and togetherness.The conservative activist's memorial service is scheduled for Sunday with speakers already announced, including his wife, Erika Kirk, Trump and Vice President JD Vance.What People Are SayingVice President JD Vance on X on Wednesday: "To my friends on the political Right: I understand the feeling that people are putting words into Charlie Kirk's mouth. At some level, I agree and share your frustration."Try to remember: a lot of people loved Charlie. It is natural for them to debate his views and his legacy. In fact, I think Charlie would welcome that. But for now, let's celebrate our friend, remember his impact, and save the debate for after his funeral."Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, in remarks shared with Newsweek by his office: "Just understand, you pull those stunts in Florida, you are going to face serious consequences. We're not just going to sit there idly by and let you destroy public property." Read more
