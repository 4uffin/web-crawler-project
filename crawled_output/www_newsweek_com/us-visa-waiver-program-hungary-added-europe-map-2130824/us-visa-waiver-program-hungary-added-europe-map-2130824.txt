The Trump administration said Tuesday that it was restoring Hungary's full access to the U.S. Visa Waiver Program, citing Prime Minister Viktor Orb√°n's actions on immigration.Following the move, which reversed Biden-era restrictions, much of Western and Central Europe now falls within the so-called ESTA program.Why It MattersThe White House has taken a tough stance on immigration, both illegal and legal, since January, including the introduction of a travel ban for multiple countries. Hungary's leader has been a longtime ally of President Donald Trump, and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) decision likely shows improving relations between the U.S. and Hungary.What To KnowDHS said Hungary was to have its Visa Waiver Program (VWP) status fully restored after leaders there took steps to address security vulnerabilities, which led to restrictions in early 2021.At that time, DHS revoked already-issued ESTAs of all Hungarian passport holders born outside of Hungary, and denied new applications from that group. Then in August 2023, President Joe Biden's DHS limited ESTA lengths from two years to one.Under Orb√°n's leadership, DHS said, Hungary had worked to better vet those entering and leaving the country.
Hungary is among 28 European nations granted access to the VWP, making up a majority of participants, including the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Spain, Greece and Italy. A handful of nations outside Europe are on the list, including Australia and Chile.The program allows visitors to the U.S. to enter without a visa for up to 90 days, as long as they do not intend to stay beyond that. Applicants use the State Department's Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) to apply ahead of travel, and must be approved by the department.For Hungary's Orb√°n, the change likely marks a significant step in strengthening his relationship with Trump and the U.S. The pair have been seen as allies over the years, but Trump has still expressed his frustrations with his Hungarian counterpart over issues arising from the Russia-Ukraine war in recent months.The Trump administration also recently said it was working to get Argentina back on the list. That announcement came as part of a visit to the country by Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, who said it was about a "mutual desire to promote lawful travel while deterring threats."

What People Are SayingRobert Palladino, U.S. charg√© d'affaires in Budapest, on X: "Hungary has taken important steps to address security vulnerabilities and has reaffirmed its commitment to our shared security partnership. Recognizing these efforts, President Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem have acted swiftly to restore Hungary's full status in the Visa Waiver Program, strengthening our alliance and reaffirming America's support for friends who defend their borders and uphold high standards."P√©ter Szijj√°rt√≥, Hungary's minister of foreign affairs and trade, on X: "The Biden admin treated Hungary as an enemy & made travel to the US very difficult. That era is over. Starting Sept 30, thanks to our agreement with the [Trump] admin, Hungarian citizens return to the US Visa Waiver Program with ESTA valid for 2 years & multiple entries."What's NextApplications will be accepted as soon as September 30 for all Hungarian citizens.
