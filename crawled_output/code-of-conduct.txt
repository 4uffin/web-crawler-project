It applies to everyone using Hashnode and is part of the Hashnode community, including our team, and anyone posting to our site, chat rooms, or social media.‚úã Hashnode is dedicated to creating an inclusive environment for everyone, regardless of race, ethnicity, religion, color, national origin, age, disability (physical or mental), sexual orientation, gender identity, parental status, marital status, and political affiliation as well as gender expression, mental illness, socioeconomic status or background, neuro(a)typicality, or physical appearance. We‚Äôre united by Hashnode‚Äôs values, and we celebrate our unique differences.üéØ The goals of the Code of Conduct is‚Ä¶üëâ To specify a baseline standard of behavior so that people with different social values and communication styles can talk about and on Hashnode effectively, productively, and respectfully.üëâ To provide a mechanism for resolving conflicts in the community when they arise.üëâ To make our community welcoming to people from different backgrounds. Diversity is critical to the project; for Hashnode to be successful, it needs contributors and users from all backgrounds.The contents of this code of conduct are concepts we expect teammates to work to apply to their daily lives in and outside of Hashnode. Specifically, the code of conduct applies to teammate interactions in various areas of our shared professional lives, including all events hosted by Hashnode, shared online spaces (Discord, email, Twitter Spaces, Youtube videos etc.), social media, blog-posts, or other events where we represent Hashnode.üôè Our ValuesThese are the values to which people in the Hashnode community (‚ÄúHashnoders‚Äù) should aspire.Be patientRemember that people have varying communication styles and that not everyone is using their native language. (Meaning and tone can be lost in translation.)Be thoughtfulProductive communication requires effort. Think about how your words will be interpreted.Remember that sometimes it is best to refrain entirely from commenting.Be charitableInterpret the arguments of others in good faith, do not seek to disagree.When we do disagree, try to understand why.Be friendly and welcoming. Be respectfulIn particular, respect differences of opinion.If a situation makes it hard to be friendly, stop participating and move on.Avoid destructive behavior:Derailing: stay on topic; if you want to talk about something else, start a new conversation.Unconstructive criticism: don't merely decry the current state of affairs; offer‚Äîor at least solicit‚Äîsuggestions as to how things may be improved.Snarking (pithy, unproductive, sniping comments)Discussing potentially offensive or sensitive issues; this all too often leads to unnecessary conflict.Microaggressions: brief and commonplace verbal, behavioral and environmental indignities that communicate hostile, derogatory or negative slights and insults to a person or group.Avoid sarcasm and be careful with jokes ‚Äî tone is hard to decipher online. Prefer gender-neutral language when uncertain.People are complicated. You should expect to be misunderstood and to misunderstand others; when this inevitably occurs, resist the urge to be defensive or assign blame. Try not to take offense where no offense was intended. Give people the benefit of the doubt. Even if the intent was to provoke, do not rise to it. It is the responsibility of all parties to de-escalate conflict when it arises.üå∏ Our expectationsFollow our guidelines and remember that our community is made with kindness, open-mindedness, and mutual respect.If you‚Äôre here to share your articles or help others, be patient and welcoming.If you‚Äôre here to read articles or ask questions to others, make it as easy as possible for others to help you.Be clear and constructive when commenting on an article, giving feedback, taking part in a conversation, and be open when receiving a reply.Edits, comments, and suggestions are healthy parts of our community.üõë Unacceptable behaviorsThe Hashnode team is committed to providing a welcoming and safe environment for all.
