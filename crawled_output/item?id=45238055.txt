Here's a zoomable 3D model of the world's busiest train station, Shinjuku in Tokyo:https://satoshi7190.github.io/Shinjuku-indoor-threejs-demo/3.6 million passengers per day. Wikipedia:The main East Japan Railway Company (JR East) station and the directly adjacent private railways have a total of 35 platforms, an underground arcade, above-ground arcade and numerous hallways with another 17 platforms (52 total) that can be accessed through hallways to five directly connected stations without surfacing outside. The entire above/underground complex has well over 200 exits.replynumpad0 12 hours ago

Throwing in Japan into random topics in trains feel somewhat unfair. Most train fact sheets fail to include most Asian nations except Japan, often missing even Korea and Taiwan.Commuter trains in many East/Southeast Asian cities like Shanghai has developed to levels comparable to Tokyo. Trains in some Central Asian cities such as Mumbai were also always notorious for congestions. I think those should also be considered more often and at greater depths, Fermi estimated if need be, than we would be just keep dropping random Shinjuku facts left and right.replydecimalenough 10 hours ago

We have stats for India, and they're no match: Kolkata Howrah gets about 1M pax per day, Mumbai CST around 670k. Nothing to sneeze at, but still several million (!) less than Shinjuku.China has numerous airport-sized stations that handle huge volumes of long-distance passengers, but I'm not aware of any single commuter hub remotely the size of Shinjuku. Partly this is because of the economic system: Chinese trains are all state-run and centralized, while a large part of why Shinjuku is so busy is that it's a hub for numerous private railways as well.replydmoy 5 hours ago

> I'm not aware of any single commuter hub remotely the size of ShinjukuThere certainly isn't one that does the volume of passengers.
Shanghai Hongqiao or Beijing South are probably busiest, and they're 3-4x less passengers than Shinjuku.> Partly this is because of the economic system: Chinese trains are all state-run and centralized, while a large part of why Shinjuku is so busy is that it's a hub for numerous private railways as well.I think another part of it is also size of network.

> 3-4x less passengers than ShinjukuExactly what I meant by comparable - those are within 10x. The up to date, yet still suspiciously Japan-dominated table on Wikipedia[1] has couple Indian and Chinese stations within top 20s, as I suspected. The must be more complete data in some non-English forms that has not been pulled into the English bubble on the WWW.I believe I've been to stations like Daimon-Hamamatsucho and I can sort of understand how such random commuter stops in Tokyo could tally up somewhat absurd passenger counts, but there was absolutely no way that rails in Japan is singlehandedly so ahead of everything in the world that not even any cutting edge Chinese cities compare.

I think you forget to take into account how centralized Japan is. Tokyo is not only the biggest city in the world. It’s also extremely centralized in terms of its infrastructure and as much as other Asian cities have developed similarly, they have also developed more recent and with a different urban model. It’s unlikely that the hub system used in Japan will be replicated somewhere else on that scale.replykaladin-jasnah 11 hours ago

Wow, very nice project.The ones in Zürich are not actually metro stations. They where built to be, but then the city voted against a metro. The stations that were already built were converted into tram stations. There where some complications like that fact the the tram is almost too tall to fit. The pantograph is almost fully compressed when the tram enters the tunnel.The trams also switch to the left side as the doors are only one side.[1] https://cdn.dreso.com/fileadmin/_processed_/0/3/csm_Tierspit...[2] https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tramtunnel_Milchbuck%E2%80%93S...

Zurich does pretty well with light rail, trams and buses. Public transport is very good there. Two more reasons are that the city isn't that big, so you're in easy walking distance of some sort of connection, and the terrain isn't ideal. A good chunk of the population live up steep hills which are well-served by the tram system. The airport is also very well-connected by bus/tram/rail, and only 10-15 minutes to the centre.That said, I would have loved to see HBf on this website.replycoderatlarge 12 hours ago

I really like urban places with public transport on the street. It leads to less cars and more pedestrian friendly streets.

Leipzig is rather inconsistent.Hauptbahnhof (main station) is incomplete, or possibly overly pedantic; it's missing the "Westseite" station part where tram 9 stops (it doesn't pass through the 4 middle tracks where the other trams make their stops.)
It's technically listed as a separate stop on plans, but last I checked it's considered the same stop for transfers (i.e. you don't get "walk from station A to station B" instructions.)
It's also almost directly above the subterranean S-Bahn tracks that are shown, so just by location it should be included…
(and it's also misspelled Leizpig, which is a little funny.)For Bayerischer Bahnhof and Wilhelm-Leuschner-Platz, the tram stops are completely missing.replyrsynnott 56 minutes ago

Very impressive work.I also learned something, which I'd always wondered cynically but never thought to investigate. The walking connection between lines at some stations in Barcelona seems so long as to not make sense, but it's explained here that at the time the different lines and stations were dug and extended independently by different companies.> Among the reasons for having such long corridors [in Barcelona] is the lack of planning or the vision of the metro network as a bunch of individual lines. As an example: line 1 and line 4 were extended to Urquinaona in 1932, but both lines were not connected until 1972, as they were originally operated by different companies.replyrsynnott 31 minutes ago

Are there at least multiple entrances? Dublin's main station, Connolly, is actually the amalgamation of two stations, one terminal station and one through station, which were originally owned by different companies before the rail system was nationalised. The only entrances are through the terminal station, so to get to the through lines, you need to walk for about 10 minutes through the terminal station (making them mostly pointless; it's usually quicker just to get on/off at the next station, which has a proper entrance).They are, apparently, _finally_ going to open a new entrance directly to the through lines, but they've been talking about it for years and I'll believe it when I see it.replyFearNotDaniel 12 hours ago
| parent | prev | next [–]
In London that’s also mostly true due to the patchwork history of different companies building different lines… however when King’s Cross/St Pancras was redeveloped a few years ago the “official” interchange route between Piccadilly and Victoria lines became much, much longer - minutes of walking compared to seconds. This site doesn’t cover that station, but does link to TfL’s own diagrams via IanVisits, and the reason is clear: at one end the platforms of both lines are almost touching - and I believe that shortcut staircase is still there if you ignore the signs and know where to find it - but the tourist friendly route is much more circuitous, going up to the mainline station and back again. I assume it helps to relieve congestion in an extremely busy station, I remember more than one occasion when they just have to close entry to the platforms during rush hour due to overcrowding.replyanticensor 4 hours ago

During the Cold War, Russia managed to map huge parts of the world, sometimes with higher quality and more accurate measurements than the countries themselves! Especially noteworthy considering that some of those countries (like the UK) were trying their hardest to prevent those sort of maps being made in the first place, yet the Russians ended up with better maps of the UK than UK themselves.Considering that that happened decades ago, I'm guessing their (and others) capability of doing those sort of things have only improved, not gotten worse.

1. Paris (~2.32 stations/km²)
2. Seoul (~1.27)
3. Madrid (~0.50)
4. Tokyo (~0.46)
5. London (~0.17)
6. Berlin (~0.19)
7. Hong Kong (~0.09)
8. Shanghai (~0.06)
9. Rome (~0.057)Seoul is highest among major Asian metro systems in terms of station concentration, making it the city in Asia with the densest metro network per square kilometer. Seoul has 768 stations in its metropolitan subway system spread across the city proper area of 605 km². By comparison, Tokyo’s combined metro (Tokyo Metro + Toei) has around 286 stations over ~621 km, giving a density of about 0.46 stations/km². Beijing has 523 stations but the city covers about 16,411 km²—yielding a much lower density (~0.03 stations/km²). Shanghai’s figure fluctuates due to rapid expansions: 409 unique stations from early 2025 data.In addition to density, another interesting metric is
the number of street-level entrances (exit/entry points). Counting just stations ignores how many access points are available to the public. More entrances = better coverage, shorter walking distances, improved accessibility, especially in dense urban zones. Examples from Paris are:
Saint‑Lazare station (Lines 3, 12, 13, 14) has 11 entrances. Hotel de Ville (Lines 1 & 11) has 7 entrances. Madeleine station (Lines 8, 12, 14) has 5 accesses with 7 separate entrances. Alesia station (Line 4) has 6 entrances. Opera station (Lines 3,7,8) has 3 main entrances.On average, Paris Metro stations have approximately 3–6 street-level entrances, with major hubs having 7–11. Paris doesn’t just have many stations, it maximizes them with multiple entry points, making its system exceptionally accessible over its territory.
Seoul also scores similar in accessibility due to its exit-rich stations, especially in dense areas. Other major metros (Tokyo, Madrid, London) lag when entry points are factored in.I did not include US cities but I believe New York City might be notable.replyMordisquitos 7 hours ago

> 4. Madrid, Metro de Madrid, ~300, 605, ~0.50> [...] Madrid has a dense network too (≈0.50), though well behind Paris.As a native of Madrid, I must point out that using the nominal surface area of the municipality of Madrid (~605 km²) is misleading for these purposes due to the Monte del Pardo [0] and Soto de Viñuelas [1], two fenced off forest areas covering around 180 km² between them. The impact of these areas on the nominal surface area of the city is visually obvious when you compare the outlines of Madrid and Paris administrative areas:+ Madrid: https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/5326784+ Paris: https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/7444As a result, the relevant surface for estimating the density of Metro stations in Madrid should be at most ~425 km². While one may arguably also want to exclude the Bois de Boulogne and the Bois de Vincennes from the surface area of Paris, even the "de-Pardo'd" surface area of Madrid still contains significant non-urban areas such as the Casa de Campo forest, large non-built-up areas, and even most of its airport.(In any case though, after this pedantic "well ackshually", I must also point out that a few Madrid Metro stations actually fall outside of its municipal limits. I would get out more, but I live in a town without a Metro)[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_de_El_Pardo[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soto_de_Viñuelasreplylucianbr 9 hours ago

Is Paris 6 times smaller than Madrid and 15 times smaller than London? Seems suspicious to me. What exactly is the boundary of this "area" and how does it relate to the subway network?replyMordisquitos 7 hours ago
| root | parent | next [–]
A significant proportion of the administrative area of Madrid is covered by fenced-off forests. Plus it covers other swathes of non-developed land and even most of its airport. The administrative area of Paris proper, on the other hand, is fully urbanised. See here for comparison:+ Madrid: https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/5326784+ Paris: https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/7444London is a whole different animal. While Madrid and Paris are arguably "similar" cities in terms of urban design and residential density, London and UK cities in general are completely different.replylucianbr 5 hours ago

Love this project. Back in my transit blogging days, one of the themes was short and long transfers. And here this idea immediately starts surfacing just looking at the stations - the crazy mazes with long tunnels are cool to explore on paper, but suck for actual transfers. It adds slogs in the middle of the trips, and kind of discourages transit use because trips seem longer and more work.When scrolling down, the author actually includes a long discussion on the best possible transfer layouts! Many of the terrible stations over time are of course historically grown, evolved over time, and weren't the result of some maniac evil genius deciding to create miserable transfers. Systems are built sometimes over a hundred years, so a later station is added mostly where it can fit, not a as a result of some master plan.But there's also ways to deal with these issues, which can be found in Berlin.1) for the recently opened "Unter den linden" station, which is a transfer between a new extension (u5) and a 100-year-old line (u6), a station on the old line was actually moved by 180m so that the transfer would be good. (That is, the old station was closed and a new station built a bit a distance away)2) in general in Berlin, especially after WWII, a lot of the subway construction followed a very long term master plan (to the extend that West Berlin actually planned a network for all of Berlin, even though the East was in another country behind the iron curtain). When stations were built, the planners "knew" it would be a transfer some day, so they added in accomodations ("Bauvorleistung" or preparations ahead of actual construction), often whole station shells for the future line it would connect to. This resulted in a lot of short transfers even when lines were built decades apart. And it also resulted in a bunch of ghost stations, which have yet to be connected to lines.replygerikson 15 hours ago

As the title suggests it is not a website of models of European metro stations because:(a) it contains models of North American stations, and(b) it does not contain stations from the St Petersburg[1] or Moscow metros which are significant European metros (the Moscow metro[2] is the longest in Europe)[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Petersburg_Metro[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Metroreply
