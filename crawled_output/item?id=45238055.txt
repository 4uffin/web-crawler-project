Very impressive work.I also learned something, which I'd always wondered cynically but never thought to investigate. The walking connection between lines at some stations in Barcelona seems so long as to not make sense, but it's explained here that at the time the different lines and stations were dug and extended independently by different companies.> Among the reasons for having such long corridors [in Barcelona] is the lack of planning or the vision of the metro network as a bunch of individual lines. As an example: line 1 and line 4 were extended to Urquinaona in 1932, but both lines were not connected until 1972, as they were originally operated by different companies.replybambax 52 minutes ago

This is insane. Never saw anything like it.One minor nitpick: zooming the map is very slow (maybe Leaflet is not the best choice?). And the main station in Paris is missing: Châtelet-Les Halles.Other than that, incredible work!! Amazing.replybenoitg 47 minutes ago

Châtelet is there, you have to click on the 3D icon to experience the full majesty of its unending corridors in 3Dreplytcumulus 42 minutes ago

There even is a section on Chatelet Les Halles if you scroll down. Insane station.replyguilamu 46 minutes ago

Zooming working perfectly on my galaxy s23.Also, Châtelet les Halles is available just after 'Château d'eau".replyjdranczewski 49 minutes ago

A very cool project, and a great resource for people with reduced mobility - I semi-regularly use Transport for London's station drawings (linked on this website) over the official accessibility map, which doesn't differentiate between stairs and escalators for example.replyneuronic 0 minutes ago

Finally going to get a mental model of Jungfernstieg, Hamburg after a decade of living here. Wow.replywiether 15 minutes ago

Incredible work!I first looked at _regular_ stations, but once I understood that it was done by a single guy, I had to look at Paris' Mordor: Châtelet.The 3D view looks like an ants nest, as expected.Very impressed by the work done!replyundebuggable 37 minutes ago

I was never able to build mental model of Alexanderplatz in Berlin. Most of the times was simply following the signs and yup, the layout is complicated.replythrow-qqqqq 26 minutes ago

Holy shit! This is an incredible piece of work.And they are almost all drawn “manually”! I am SO impressed by the dedication> For the last 10 years I have been able to draw around 2,547 stations> A pen, a notebook, a bit of spatial vision and the willingness to navigate all the staircases, corridors, platforms and mezzanines are enough to draw a station> Due to the boredom provoked by the COVID-19 lockdown in 2020, I decided to digitalize all the sketches I had drawn in since the early 2010sreplydddw 52 minutes ago

Nice! Would nice to have Maashaven Rotterdam, being the highest elevated one in the Netherlands. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maashaven_metro_stationreplyExpertAdvisor01 17 minutes ago

The product of extreme focus and obsessive dedication.
It showed me my local subway station immediately and everything checked out.
Great resource.reply
