Wow, very nice project.The ones in Zürich are not actually metro stations. They where built to be but then the city voted against a metro. The stations that were already built were converted into tram stations. There where some complications like that fact the the tram is almost too tall to fit. The photograph is almost fully compressed when the tram enters the tunnel.The trams also switch to the left side as the doors are only one side.[1] https://cdn.dreso.com/fileadmin/_processed_/0/3/csm_Tierspit...[2] https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tramtunnel_Milchbuck%E2%80%93S...

I think you meant a pantograph instead of a photograph ?https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantograph_(transport)replyrwmj 43 minutes ago

I'd love to know why you'd vote against having a metro.replysschueller 39 minutes ago

Costs, existing infrastructure and alternatives (S-Bahn was extended) and fears that the local businesses above would loose foot traffic if people are no longer traveling above ground with the trams.replyarccy 31 minutes ago

with sufficient density and priority on roads, a tram network might be better, other than having to wait outside in bad weatherreplyizacus 42 minutes ago

Here's a zoomable 3D model of the world's busiest train station, Shinjuku in Tokyo:https://satoshi7190.github.io/Shinjuku-indoor-threejs-demo/3.6 million passengers per day. Wikipedia:The main East Japan Railway Company (JR East) station and the directly adjacent private railways have a total of 35 platforms, an underground arcade, above-ground arcade and numerous hallways with another 17 platforms (52 total) that can be accessed through hallways to five directly connected stations without surfacing outside. The entire above/underground complex has well over 200 exits.replywalterlw 52 minutes ago

Very impressive work.
Was very saddened to see how Ukrainian Kyiv and Kharkiv stations were excluded. We have deep stations (like Arsenal'na at 105m that connects directly to the above-ground Dnipro station on a river bank), we have both Soviet-made and new stations. Also now they are doubly essential being used for both transportation and shelter during air raids by millions.replyjdranczewski 1 hour ago

A very cool project, and a great resource for people with reduced mobility - I semi-regularly use Transport for London's station drawings (linked on this website) over the official accessibility map, which doesn't differentiate between stairs and escalators for example.replybambax 1 hour ago

This is insane. Never saw anything like it.One minor nitpick: zooming the map is very slow (maybe Leaflet is not the best choice?). And the main station in Paris is missing: Châtelet-Les Halles.Other than that, incredible work!! Amazing.replydiiiimaaaa 41 minutes ago

Leaflet should easily handle stuff like this if configured correctly. OP just slaps 3000 markers in a single layer, and each of them is an image element in dom. Should probably use some marker clustering for that.replybenoitg 1 hour ago

Châtelet is there, you have to click on the 3D icon to experience the full majesty of its unending corridors in 3Dreplytcumulus 1 hour ago

There even is a section on Chatelet Les Halles if you scroll down. Insane station.replyguilamu 1 hour ago

Very impressive work.I also learned something, which I'd always wondered cynically but never thought to investigate. The walking connection between lines at some stations in Barcelona seems so long as to not make sense, but it's explained here that at the time the different lines and stations were dug and extended independently by different companies.> Among the reasons for having such long corridors [in Barcelona] is the lack of planning or the vision of the metro network as a bunch of individual lines. As an example: line 1 and line 4 were extended to Urquinaona in 1932, but both lines were not connected until 1972, as they were originally operated by different companies.replypjmlp 7 minutes ago

Incredible work!I first looked at _regular_ stations, but once I understood that it was done by a single guy, I had to look at Paris' Mordor: Châtelet.The 3D view looks like an ants nest, as expected.Very impressed by the work done!replyprof-dr-ir 38 minutes ago

OMG this is amazing! I've checked my station (Velázquez - Madrid) and it is 100% accurate. Also, the 3D stations are insane! ¡Enhorabona!replyundebuggable 1 hour ago

I was never able to build mental model of Alexanderplatz in Berlin. Most of the times was simply following the signs and yup, the layout is complicated.replythrow-qqqqq 1 hour ago

Holy shit! This is an incredible piece of work.And they are almost all drawn “manually”! I am SO impressed by the dedication> For the last 10 years I have been able to draw around 2,547 stations> A pen, a notebook, a bit of spatial vision and the willingness to navigate all the staircases, corridors, platforms and mezzanines are enough to draw a station> Due to the boredom provoked by the COVID-19 lockdown in 2020, I decided to digitalize all the sketches I had drawn in since the early 2010sreplyDansvidania 49 minutes ago

The page footnote says that all sketches were hand drawn by the author over a 10 year period, and digitized during COVID by the power of extreme boredom.replyljsprague 8 minutes ago

Nice, while Shinjuku is much larger and more complex than others it has been really intuitive using it in the real world.replyitsmevictor 39 minutes ago

Love this project. Back in my transit blogging days, one of the themes was short and long transfers. And here this idea immediately starts surfacing just looking at the stations - the crazy mazes with long tunnels are cool to explore on paper, but suck for actual transfers. It adds slogs in the middle of the trips, and kind of discourages transit use because trips seem longer and more work.When scrolling down, the author actually includes a long discussion on the best possible transfer layouts! Many of the terrible stations over time are of course historically grown, evolved over time, and weren't the result of some maniac evil genius deciding to create miserable transfers. Systems are built sometimes over a hundred years, so a later station is added mostly where it can fit, not a as a result of some master plan.But there's also ways to deal with these issues, which can be found in Berlin.1) for the recently opened "Unter den linden" station, which is a transfer between a new extension (u5) and a 100-year-old line (u6), a station on the old line was actually moved by 180m so that the transfer would be good. (That is, the old station was closed and a new station built a bit a distance away)2) in general in Berlin, especially after WWII, a lot of the subway construction followed a very long term master plan (to the extend that West Berlin actually planned a network for all of Berlin, even though the East was in another country behind the iron curtain). When stations were built, the planners "knew" it would be a transfer some day, so they added in accomodations ("Bauvorleistung" or preparations ahead of actual construction), often whole station shells for the future line it would connect to. This resulted in a lot of short transfers even when lines were built decades apart. And it also resulted in a bunch of ghost stations, which have yet to be connected to lines.replyExpertAdvisor01 1 hour ago

The product of extreme focus and obsessive dedication.
