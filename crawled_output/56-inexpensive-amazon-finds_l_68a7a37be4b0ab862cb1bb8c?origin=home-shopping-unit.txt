It’s not only soothing, but it also feels like it’s really nourishing my skin. The firming benefits are a bonus! I highly recommend this product to anyone dealing with dryness or discomfort in their neck and chest area. It’s become a must-have in my skincare routine." — JAcosta$12 at Amazon2www.amazon.comSweatBlock antiperspirant wipes with a clinical strength formulaAs always, this is a clinical-strength product, so make sure you do a spot test first (especially if you have sensitive skin)! And each box lasts two months!Promising review: "For anyone who might be a skeptic, please allow me to put you at ease. If you have hyperhidrosis, meaning it can be 9 degrees outside and you're still sweating under your arms, this product has the potential to change your life. I would sweat THROUGH a sports coat before noon. Enter the Sweat Block product. I've had it for three weeks, and it is life-changing. I DO NOT sweat under my arms anymore. I'm still on the original box that I bought three weeks ago. I had to write a review after I was cleaning the garage today in 85-degree heat...I was sweating through my shirt on my back...BUT NOT MY UNDERARMS. It is amazing!" — Frosty McGee$20 at Amazon3www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comA stunning minimizer bra to basically give you a surgery-free breast reductionSome reviewers recommend ordering one cup size up for correct coverage.Promising review: "I wear a 38DDD and finding a bra to keep them supported and dry has been a never-ending battle. I typed in 'minimize bras' and I took a chance on this one. I’m so, so thankful I did! This bra does not disappoint! It’s true to size. It keeps my chest lifted without straps digging in. It's super soft on my skin and keeps me dry! I have bought five more and got rid of all my old bras. You will not be disappointed with these bras!" — Brynn Trimaldi$28 at AmazonAdvertisement
4www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comA pack of two Downy fabric spraysPromising review: "I hate wrinkles and am lazy — two at-odds conditions. This stuff has been a staple in my life since approximately ninth grade (thanks to my mama). As a former Catholic school uniform wearer, I have discovered that this stuff was VITAL to freshening up wrinkly dress shirts that spent the after-school hours stuffed in a gym bag. The scent is light and fresh, and its wrinkle-releasing powers are nearly instant. It definitely works better on some fabrics than others (great on cotton, less great on some synthetics), but it'll improve the look of most without dealing with an iron or steamer." — Danielle Healy, BuzzFeed$17 at AmazonAdvertisement
5www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comA set of extra soft cooling bedsheetsPromising review: "Feel like expensive high-end hotel sheets. I normally use flannel sheets year-round because it’s the only material I like, but these are my new favorite. Very soft and cooling. Fit our bed perfectly.

Great sheets without the huge sticker price." — Anna Greenlun$35 at Amazon6www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comA ChomChom pet hair remover rollerPromising review: "I have a golden retriever and the shedding is out of control. My fabric sofa is constantly covered in hair and I finally decided to try this after reading an article about popular TikTok products. The reviews do not lie, this thing works magic!! I wish I had taken a before and after picture because the difference is noticeable. I watched the video tutorial before I tried it to ensure I was using it properly and everything he says is true, you do really have to put your arm to work with vigorous back and forth movement! However I find it's a great arm workout and it works wonders." — Joanne Ertel$25 at AmazonAdvertisement
7www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comA timeless tennis bracelet made with 14K gold plated cubic zirconiaPromising review: "Soooo pretty. It’s 100% [similar to] Swarovski for so cheap.

I use a lot of John Frieda products!" — JoAnn$12 at Amazon9AmazonTie-front satin PJs that'll keep you feeling breezy and coolPromising review: "It’s always a gamble getting pajamas online, especially when they’re supposed to be silky; sometimes you get that unyielding plastic-y feeling material. That’s not the case with these! They’re soft and flowy, and the ties in the front, while not Fort Knox, are still more secure than I thought they’d be. I’m definitely going to order in more colors." — Amazon Customer$29 at AmazonAdvertisement
10www.amazon.comA retinol body lotionPromising review: "I could kick myself for not trying this sooner! It is my new favorite lotion... After one night of using this, I woke up to smooth, soft moisturized skin that wasn’t itchy at all. This lotion goes on and absorbs beautifully. It’s not too thin or thick, and the scent is sensational... It’s not greasy or slick and does not have a residue that pills or transfers." — TickTokAlice$20 at Amazon11AmazonA foaming garbage disposal cleaner to clean out your rental's sinkPromising review: "Saw on TikTok (don’t judge) and automatically added to cart. So easy to use, takes probably a minute to fully bubble up and clean, and you’re left with a clean sink! I use with other drain cleaning products, but would 100% recommend for weekly maintenance." — Jessica Hamilton$4 at Amazon12www.amazon.comCatrice "Instant Awake" Under Eye BrightenerThe color adaptive formula is designed so one of four shades will work on any skin tone. Promising review: "Took years off my eyes! This product is so reasonably priced. I came across a TikTok promoting this and decided to take a chance since the price was super reasonable. My eyes looked brighter in a good way, and the concealer worked so well that I felt I looked younger. I got compliments from friends asking what I did differently with my makeup. I recommend it." — Placeholder$6 at AmazonAdvertisement
13www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comVenus Visage Teeth Whitening PensPromising review: "I’ve been looking for a way to brighten my smile for years now, and nothing has worked as well as these pens!

You will not regret!" — Amazon Customer $9 at Amazon14www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comA bug rug woven with soft woolI want this rug so bad I'm going to have to physically restrain myself from hitting the "add to cart" button. Oops, didn't work! It will be mine. Promising review: "This is the cutest little rug. I searched forever before I found it and it's exactly the idea I was picturing. I love that I can teach my daughter the name of the bugs easily since she will see them daily without messing up the ambiance of her room with bright, tacky colors. It is exactly as advertised and is made well!" — Samantha Dunseith$60 at Amazon15www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comKitsch's iconic claw clipKitsch is an LA-based, self-financed, woman-owned small business established in 2010 that specializes in hair accessories.

The shipment arrived fast, and I just love how fast it fills up the room without being lit for so long!" — Cristina Bertolotto$20 at AmazonAdvertisement

And I have tried sooo many leave-in conditioners to define her hair. Nothing thus far has worked. But this stuff is amazing! Truly defines her curls without any hold or crunch. Soft, bouncy curls. The smell is quite strong, but it does smell good. If you are sensitive to smells, you might want to prepare yourself ahead of time for this. I will buy this again and again. So glad I found something that works for my toddler's curls." — mike$9 at Amazon21www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comAnd a detangling brush that has over 65,000 5-star reviews!Reviewers swear this brush works on all hair types: straight, wavy, or curly (from 3a–4c hair).Promising review: "I'm a single dad of a 6-year-old girl, and combing her hair is the hardest part of taking care of her.

I also love that its pedestal minimizes the space it takes up on the counter. I wasn't sure about whether I would like that it is plastic but now consider it a big plus.

A perfect-sized pot for 1–2 people to share a meal, cook out of, or eat out of! I just received it yesterday, and I’ve already cooked with it twice with no issues at all. It’s the cutest light pink color and the shape of a heart at a fantastic price. I currently own three Dutch ovens and this is the best one that I already use way more often than the other two. It is not heavy at all, and it is very manageable for an everyday pot. Super easy to clean with some soaking after letting it cool down and rubbing with the soft side of the sponge." — D. Dorado$35 at AmazonAdvertisement

Plus, this single-tool solution means less heat damage to your hair! Promising review: "Amazing product. I wish I found this 20 years ago!! I have naturally curly hair and enjoy a nice blowout without having that pin straight 'burnt' flat iron look. This product helped me achieve the blowout look in about five minutes (yes five!). When it comes to hair, I’m a super novice and this is by far the easiest most effective (inexpensive) blowout. I would give this more than 5 stars if I could. Where has it been all my life?!?!" — Sara Kovach$31 at Amazon26Amazon, www.amazon.comA plush diaper caddy basket with a wipeable surfacePromising review: "This is my second diaper caddy to own. I got a new one for my second child because the last one became a toy carrier for my daughter. This one is beautiful and looks like the color that is pictured. It's also very sturdy where some are flimsy. I organized mine with the essentials. It’s able to fit plenty of diapers, wipes, burp rags, diaper cream, gripe water, etc. which made it very easy to use and take all over the house. The dividers come out — they are attached by Velcro but are easy to put together or take off if you want to adjust it." — Katie Mabe$22 at Amazon27www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comA root touchup powder great for folks with fine hairCheck it out in action on TikTok here!Promising review: "LOVE!

Definitely going to get some more in other colors!" — Karen$20 at Amazon29Amazon, AmazonA sulfate- and paraben-free dry shampoo foamPromising review: "I have very, very fine and fragile hair. It’s wavy (2b–2c with some 3a curls mixed in). My ends are dry, and my scalp gets very oily quickly. When the product arrived, I was on second-day hair. I worked the foam through my roots and the sides of my head. The most oily places for me. It was easy to work through, and it smelled fresh and clean. My results were amazing! My roots looked clean, no residue or buildup like powder dry shampoos. My scalp does not itch, and it gives my fine, flat hair a ton of volume. Also, my hair looks thicker when I use it. I usually can’t go more than a day or two without washing my hair. With this product, I was able to go four days without washing my hair." — Amelia Tilton$7 at Amazon30Amazon, www.amazon.comA positive daily plannerEach planner comes with 50 tear-off sheets the size of a standard piece of paper.

I put one in a month on the clean tub setting and it eliminates the odor. I just made a T-chart with a permanent marker on the box for the months and add an X when I put the tab in for the month. This way I don't miss a month and my washer runs great." — akkeber$11 at Amazon33www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comCosrx’s Snail Mucin Repairing EssencePromising review: "If you can get over the ick factor of snail mucin, it is deeply hydrating and helps with hyperpigmentation and acne. Calms inflammation and redness. If you’re having flaky, dry skin from eczema or reactions to retinol, use this to help repair your skin barrier and keep your skin supple. It is a gentle occlusive and seals in moisture. Everyone’s skin is different. What works for me may not work for you. But I swear by the essence to help my reactive skin, repair the skin barrier, and help with my eczema. I will use it forever." — Connie$17 at AmazonAdvertisement

Listen I’m 48, and I’ve bought a lot of face cream 'stuff' over the years. Expensive stuff that did nothing. Finally started using Cerave thanks to my 19-year-old daughter and TikTok, lol. I decided to try the eye cream, and I noticed a difference the morning I started using it. The brightening is apparent. Love this stuff." — Michelle Petrosh$14 at Amazon35www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comA jar of The Pink Stuff (the internet's favorite cleaning product)Promising review: "I used this product for my stove because it's one thing I dislike cleaning. I have used different degreaser sprays and they all are so toxic and don't work for me. The Magic Eraser was okay but I used several at a time and I had to scrub so hard. But this product oh my goodness, legit a miracle. It doesn't have any type of smell. I put the paste on a cloth, clean the area then wipe it off with a damp cloth and voilà, magic!" — May$5 at Amazon36www.amazon.comA bottle of professional-grade callus-removing gelThere's also an extra-strength version!Promising review: "Best foot callus remover I have ever used! I read a lot of the reviews before purchasing this product. Most callus removers I have purchased in the past were not very effective. So I was encouraged by the reviews. I saw that a lot of reviewers mentioned to be very careful not to leave it on longer than three or four minutes. My feet were the softest they have ever been. Love love love." — Cheri whisker$8 at AmazonAdvertisement

Now I can have a glass of wine and not have to dart to a package of antihistamine! Makes a great gift. Even thinking of splitting a box into stocking stuffers. Each wand is individually wrapped. I have purchased these several times and will continue to do so." — KellyH$12 at Amazon39Amazon, AmazonA water bottle bag that'll hook comfortably snug around your beloved tumblerPromising review: "I love this water bottle carrier!

40www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comA magnetic cat-eye gel nail polish kitTo get the cat eye effect, apply one layer, cure with a UV light for one minute, add a second layer, and use the included magnet to move the glitter into the desired formation. A few reviewers didn't find the magnet to be strong enough, so you might want to grab this magnet kit as well. Promising review: "I've been doing my nails for years, and this was so fast and fun to use. I always wanted cat eye polishes in my collection and this was perfect! Especially for Christmas time! I will say they are thick, and I'm guessing that's because they're pigmented and packed with the little magnetic bits for maximum shine and glimmer. I feel like I have the northern lights on my nails! I would recommend playing on a few test nails beforehand to get a handle on the different patterns you can make with the magnet. Overall, would recommend it for anyone wanting something easy and fun!" — Hailey$14 at Amazon41www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comA versatile veggie chopper that'll help you prep (and clean up!) with speedPromising review: "Makes life so much easier.

43www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comGood Molecules Yerba Mate Wake Up Eye GelPromising review: "I love this product and have noticed a huge difference when using it consistently.

Honestly love all the Good Molecules products." — Hayden Smith $6 at Amazon44www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comA reviewer-adored Cozy Spaces-themed coloring bookStart a collection!

46Amazon, www.amazon.comA "Shark Tank"-favorite Click & Carry Grocery Bag CarrierClick & Carry is a "Shark Tank" and QVC-featured small business that specializes in easy carry accessories. Promising review: "TikTok made me buy it. This is great when you have a few bags and a box — for example, if you balance the bags, you can throw it over your shoulder and walk inside and have two free hands to carry the box, which is great. Product seems well built, and is comfortable on your shoulder or hand because of the padding." — Hung$14 at Amazon47www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comMiss Mouth, a travel-friendly stain sprayPromising reviews: "My mother’s group recommended this stain removing spray. I was dumb enough to put my 6-month-old in a white bib while he enjoyed some frozen berry teethers. This came to the rescue (pictured above)!" — L"I never write reviews, but this stuff is absolutely amazing! I keep this is the laundry basket and spray as stains happen and even white clothes come out perfectly clean each time! I mostly use it for baby poop, but it’s also worked on food and coffee stains for me and my husband. Seriously – it's a life saver!" — Amazon Customer$8 at Amazon48www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comA silicone clip-on strainer that's dishwasher-safePromising review: "This is easy to use and now that I’ve had it a few weeks, I don’t know how I have lived without.

It is great quality, comfortable, and lightweight. I love that the straps are adjustable and elastic. Unfortunately, babies are bound to take a fall when they’re learning how to sit up/walk — so be two steps ahead and purchase this product to protect your little one!" — Taylor$25 at Amazon50www.amazon.comAn E.l.f. Camo Liquid Blush — a blendable and buildable blushPromising review: "This stuff is no joke. I like to use one product for my full face for a quick makeup routine, as eyeshadow, blush, and highlight all at once. When I tell you I need exactly two dots for my whole face, I couldn’t be more serious! It has a different, more glossy texture than a Rare Beauty blush, but the pigment is much stronger. Comes off very dewy and kind of glossy but can be made matte with powder. The only thing I will say is that if you overwork it, there can be small lifted spots, which happened to me when I first tried it because I used too much and then had to try to blend so much. Already purchased another color. Love E.l.f. makeup!" — oscar Julian zapotitla$7 at Amazon51www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comE.l.f. Halo Glow Liquid FilterPromising review: "If you like Charlotte Tilbury, flawless filter this is leaps and bounds better! Just buy it. The coverage is better, [it] makes my skin have the most amazing natural glow! The colors run with a more warm/yellow undertone which worked great for me! Spend a fraction of the price and just get it, you will be happy you did!" — Amazonreview$14 at AmazonAdvertisement
52Amazon, www.amazon.comA cervical neck "pillow" that'll provide ergonomic supportAfter ages of looking at this thing and wondering if it was the real deal, I finally buckled and bought it. My husband and I both carry stress in our neck, and we're on our computers all day for work, so we needed some serious help. This is surprisingly comfortable to lay on. I use it 10 minutes a day and have noticed serious pain relief, and believe it is a great tool as I work on improving my posture.If you have any neck or back issues, talk to your doctor before use.Promising review: "I was very surprised at the quality of this neck and shoulder relaxer especially at this price. It has a nice structure to it, but is also soft enough to cradle your neck in comfort. Just taking a few minutes to use this helps to improve my neck and shoulder pain greatly. This especially helps when you have slept on your neck wrong and have a Crick in your neck. Very happy with my purchase and would definitely recommend it." — Cindy$20 at Amazon53www.amazon.comA set of French fry clips to keep open snacks freshPromising review: "These are very cute and I love the magnet holder to stick on my fridge so they are easily accessible.

Looks great...is very useful, and lightens the beauty bag load." — KMC$25 at AmazonAdvertisement

Like, hands down, my favorite product ever. This camera definitely makes life easier, and I wish I had it for my other two when they were babies.

I recommend it to all my mom friends!" — Kristin Morgan$24 at Amazon56www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comAnd finally, a mini highland cow plush (that can be heated AND cooled!!)Promising review: "My wife bought me this little guy to help me sleep not knowing if I would even care for it, but the little guy is adorable and it was just what I needed to sleep better. It could be the lavender, but I think it is just how comforting he is to hold against your chest when laying down. I don't think you can go wrong with this guy, but I do suddenly experience guilt when eating burgers...probably just me!" — Bryan$19 at AmazonReviews in this post have been edited for length and clarity.
