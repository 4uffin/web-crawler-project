In Twinless, two young men meet in a twin support group and form an unlikely friendship. Roman (Dylan O'Brien) and Dennis (James Sweeney) both search for solace and an identity without their other halves and soon become inseparable outside the group. But when Roman meets Dennis' ebullient co-worker, Marcie (Aisling Franciosi), all is revealed to be not what it seems, as each man harbors secrets that could unravel everything.

Twinless isn’t what you might expect it to be. It’s much more normal, and therefore much more haunting, than that.

Los Angeles Times
Though O’Brien is flexing his emotional range here, his hunky sincerity lands in part because Sweeney remains steady in the opposite registry.

Just trust me when I say that it’s extremely clever and full of surprises, and reinforces that writer, director, and co-star James Sweeney is a bold and refreshing filmmaker to watch.
Rated: 3.5/4

Twinless is simply one of the best films of the year, and Dylan O’Brien gives the best performance of his career.

Sandie Angulo Chen
Common Sense Media
Sweeney's dark dramedy navigates a delicate line between grief and absurdity and benefits from O'Brien's fabulous twin performances.
Rated: 4/5

Loved this movie! There were definitely some twists that I did not see coming. Entire cast did a great job in their respective roles.

I like that it was like messy and real like how life is complicated and peoples choices and the way they get their needs met is not always a straight line. It showed emotions such as vulnerability, joy, sadness, grief, hurt, and a desire for connection and love. It showed the need to be seen in validated in your existence. I would highly recommend.

First odd the cinematography was fantastic. The story took you places that you don't definitely don't expect and addresses some very interesting issues. Strong performances by all the actors.
