Congress Asks Valve, Discord, and Twitch To Testify On 'Radicalization'

from the hear-ye-hear-ye dept.
An anonymous reader quotes a report from Polygon: The CEOs of Discord, Steam, Twitch, and Reddit have been called to Congress to testify about the "radicalization of online forum users" on those platforms, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee announced Wednesday. "Congress has a duty to oversee the online platforms that radicals have used to advance political violence," said chairman of the House Oversight Committee James Comer, a Republican from Kentucky, in a statement. "To prevent future radicalization and violence, the CEOs of Discord, Steam, Twitch, and Reddit must appear before the Oversight Committee and explain what actions they will take to ensure their platforms are not exploited for nefarious purposes."
Letters from the House Oversight Committee have been sent to Humam Sakhnini, CEO of Discord; Gabe Newell, president of Steam maker Valve; Dan Clancy, CEO of Twitch; and Steve Huffman, CEO of Reddit, requesting their testimony on Oct. 8. "The hearing will examine radicalization of online forum users, including incidents of open incitement to commit violent politically motivated acts," Comer said in a letter to each CEO. [...] Discord, Steam, Twitch, and Reddit execs will have the chance to deliver five-minute opening statements prior to answering questions posed by members of the committee during October's testimony.

In my mind the reason that that gun control is not discussed in America, is because of Radical MAGAs who think that gun violence is "Made Up", that people who are killed are "crisis actors".
This distorts a whole lot of shit.
Simple common sense should dictate that nobody under 21 should have a gun, and I can not make a real case why anybody should have a gun that can commit mass murder, but MAGAs can.

If you were to ask the average "person on the street" to guess the murder rate, it would probably depend hugely on whether a school shooting or racially- or politically-motivated murder was currently a big media story.

It's nothing like that.They want to have the narrative that "leftists are violent!!!" because they killed Charlie Kirk. Never mind the other deaths like January 6, George Floyd, etc.Never mind the fact that when the right spews hate, they claim censorship when platforms start to remove their posts.The whole point is to say the left needs to be censored and everything. Ever notice how many people are being cancelled because of their less than complimentary comments about Charlie Kirk?Double standards and all - if it's your speech been censored, then cry free speech. If it's someone you don't like, censor away!They want Steam, Discord, etc. to start deplatforming all those leftists.It's gotten so far that some Republicans are trying to back away because they realize that those laws being used to censor "the left" could easily be used to censor them for the exact same reason. The big fun being to see how the Supreme Court will allow the censorship but then twist themselves into knots trying to deny the same rights if a (D) gets to be President.

If they're going after valve it's because they're going after video games. They have been wanting to go after video games for years and years and years. There is something about the right wing where they really hate video games. TV and movies too. And they aren't too fond of books.
A big part of it is they want to control your media choices so you don't have any. I don't think they ever really got over the printing press.

Dude, nobody is telling young girls that men are evil.Little girls see the same little boys that you see. The same boys that won't look you in the eye. Don't talk about their feelings. Don't focus on their school work. Pick fights, be rude, roughhouse, disrupt class, etc. Way too fucking online and anti-social. If you're their parent, what are you DOING? You won't put them in Boy Scouts because "it's gAy"? You're part of the problem.I know you know about those exact issues because you complain about them too, but you blame the school. Now it's the girls. I think maybe you're the problem. Laying those problems at the feet of other well-adjusted kids is just fucking chilling man. Literally everything you said is backwards and wrong just like that one. Young men need help. You can start by helping them instead of blaming everyone else like a lunatic. Everyone wants to complain about the boys, nobody wants to cop to being parents of those same bored, unsocialized, unfit, way too online boys. Build a fucking doghouse with them, take them out for volunteer work, take them dirt biking FFS, and show them how adult men make new friends. The fuck is wrong with you?

Killing Charlie Kirk makes you a murderer not a radical. Charlie said some hateful things about a lot of people, and for them it's personal. Fox News and New York Post are happy to report that the alleged shooter is a member of or adjacent to one or more groups we know for a fact Charlie has said some very hateful things about. Do to them what we did in the 1950s, stoning gays is god's perfect law, etc. That's not politics, it's not policy, it's not political theory, it's just hateful. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see the possible motives here, and it wasn't disagreement over universal healthcare or college debt or size of government.
