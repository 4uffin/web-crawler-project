What this will do, is that newly graduated STEM masters and PhD will go back to their home country and we lose out on top talents.
If by "will go back" you mean "will be deported".
If they're even allowed to stay long enough to graduate...

Make it an Xbox game -- try to import things while avoiding / minimizing tariffs.

What's the long-term game-plan for "smart" / connected appliances?
My Whirlpool refrigerator was left by the previous owner when I bought my house in 1993, so it's at least 32 years old, and we got our Kenmore washer and dryer in 1993.
All three still run great.
On a related note, my 2001 Civic and 2002 CR-V are still running well.
Thankfully, none of my appliances/cars have this crap.
Are companies planning on supporting these "smart" / connected features and touch screens for 30+ years?
History so far says nope.

Yes, they could try to locate everyone that manages to use banned technology like this, but as commodity-level technology designed to be used by even unskilled individuals, they're not going to be able to stop people from using technology.
All they'll be able to do is to punish them after finding them.
Yup, 'cause the Taliban is known for giving up easily and being lenient to people breaking morality decrees. /s

Scientists find that ice generates electricity when bent

fahrbot-bot writes: Phys.org is reporting on a study published in Nature Physics involving ICN2, at the UAB campus, Xi'an Jiaotong University (Xi'an) and Stony Brook University (New York), showing for the first time that ordinary ice is a flexoelectric material — meaning it can generate electricity when subjected to mechanical deformation.
"We discovered that ice generates electric charge in response to mechanical stress at all temperatures. In addition, we identified a thin 'ferroelectric' layer at the surface at temperatures below -113C (160K)," explains Dr. Xin Wen, a member of the ICN2 Oxide Nanophysics Group and one of the study's lead researchers.
"This means that the ice surface can develop a natural electric polarization, which can be reversed when an external electric field is applied—similar to how the poles of a magnet can be flipped. The surface ferroelectricity is a cool discovery in its own right, as it means that ice may have not just one way to generate electricity, but two: ferroelectricity at very low temperatures, and flexoelectricity at higher temperatures all the way to 0 C."
This property places ice on a par with electroceramic materials such as titanium dioxide, which are currently used in advanced technologies like sensors and capacitors.

If a six-month reporting period is better, would a one-year period be even better?
The answer is another question: Better for who?
If Trump had his way, there would be no data from anyone, just his say-so -- and we can all imagine how that would go...

Real reason? To delay any financial reporting that shows the negative economic impact of administration's policiesIn this case I disagree - six months makes good sense in several ways.
I wonder who managed to talk him into making a sensible suggestion for once.
In this case, you both may be correct.

Why did you never use awk?
I know this was modded Funny, but actually... There were a few stand-alone Awk scripts in that project, but most Awk usage was smaller/simpler calls from Bash/Ksh scripts.
I do routinely use awk one-liners, even on my systems at home.

Perl has been my go-to scripting language for a long, long time -- since the '80s.
And knowing it means I don't have to use Python. :-)
It's good tool for a lot of things, but just one of many.
On the last large cross-platform (Windows, Solaris, Linux) project, I used many different languages: Assembly (x86), Bash, C, Cmd, Java, Ksh, Perl, Postscript, PowerShell, Python, SQL, Tcl/Tk, VBScript -- whatever was best for the particular task on the particular platform.
That said, using Perl often allowed the same script to be used across all platforms instead of similar scripts in different languages.
And... Emacs. (yes, I'm old) :-)
