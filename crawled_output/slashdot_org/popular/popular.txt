Doomed 'cannibal' star could soon explode in a supernova visible during day

alternative_right writes: Astronomers have discovered the secret of a strange star system that has baffled them for years, finding it contains a dead star about to erupt after overfeeding on a stellar companion. The supernova explosion of this cosmic cannibal could be as bright as the moon, making it visible with the naked eye over Earth even in broad daylight.The system in question is the double star V Sagittae located around 10,000 light-years from Earth, containing a white dwarf stellar remnant and its victim companion star, which orbit each other roughly twice every Earth day.

China Is Sending Its World-Beating Auto Industry Into a Tailspin
(reuters.com)
Submitted
by
Anonymous Coward
on Wednesday September 17, 2025 @05:10PM
An anonymous reader writes: On the outskirts of this city of 21 million, a showroom in a shopping mall offers extraordinary deals on new cars. Visitors can choose from some 5,000 vehicles. Locally made Audis are 50% off. A seven-seater SUV from China’s FAW is about $22,300, more than 60% below its sticker price. These deals – offered by a company called Zcar, which says it buys in bulk from automakers and dealerships – are only possible because China has too many cars. Years of subsidies and other government policies have aimed to make China a global automotive power and the world’s electric-vehicle leader. Domestic automakers have achieved those goals and more – and that’s the problem.
China has more domestic brands making more cars than the world’s biggest car market can absorb because the industry is striving to hit production targets influenced by government policy, instead of consumer demand, a Reuters examination has found. That makes turning a profit nearly impossible for almost all automakers here, industry executives say. Chinese electric vehicles start at less than $10,000; in the U.S., automakers offer just a few under $35,000. Most Chinese dealers can’t make money, either, according to an industry survey published last month, because their lots are jammed with excess inventory. Dealers have responded by slashing prices. Some retailers register and insure unsold cars in bulk, a maneuver that allows automakers to record them as sold while helping dealers to qualify for factory rebates and bonuses from manufacturers.
Unwanted vehicles get dumped onto gray-market traders like Zcar. Some surface on TikTok-style social-media sites in fire sales. Others are rebranded as "used" – even though their odometers show no mileage – and shipped overseas. Some wind up abandoned in weedy car graveyards. These unusual practices are symptoms of a vastly oversupplied market – and point to a potential shakeout mirroring turmoil in China’s property market and solar industry, according to many industry figures and analysts. They stem from government policies that prioritize boosting sales and market share – in service of larger goals for employment and economic growth – over profitability and sustainable competition. Local governments offer cheap land and subsidies to automakers in exchange for production and tax-revenue commitments, multiplying overcapacity across the country.

Shared genetic mechanisms underpin social life in bees and humans, study suggest
(phys.org)

alternative_right

alternative_right writes: In social species, there is individual variation in sociability—some individuals are highly social and well-connected within their society, whereas others prefer less social interaction. This variation can be driven by many factors, including mood, social status, previous experience, and genetics. However, the genetic and molecular mechanisms that influence sociability are poorly understood.Sociability is a complex characteristic, controlled by many genes, but these shared genomic features suggest there are ancient molecular building blocks of social life that have been conserved through millions of years of evolution, even if humans and bees evolved social life independently, the authors say.The authors add, "It is a central feature of all societies that group members often engage with one another, but vary in their tendency to do so. Combining automated monitoring of social interactions, DNA sequencing, and brain transcriptomics in honey bee colonies, we identified evolutionarily conserved molecular roots of sociability shared across phylogenetically distinct species, including humans."

alternative_right writes: Some people taking Ozempic, Wegovy, or Mounjaro notice that food suddenly tastes sweeter or saltier, and this subtle shift in flavor perception appears tied to reduced appetite and stronger feelings of fullness. In a study of more than 400 patients, roughly one in five experienced heightened taste sensitivity, and many reported being less hungry and more easily satisfied.

Final Fantasy composer shares concern about 'stagnation' in game music

alternative_right writes: "I won’t go as far as to call it stagnation, but I believe directors and producers hold too much power in their hands even when it comes to the music," said Uematsu, according to Automaton's translation. "Even now, game composers aren’t in a position to speak their opinion freely, and no matter how much musical knowledge or technical skills they possess, they’re still in a position where it’s difficult to speak their mind."There are almost no game producers who are well versed in worldwide entertainment and are familiar with a wide variety of musical genres, so anything goes for them as long as you make it sound like a John Williams movie soundtrack."

How thousands of 'overworked, underpaid' humans train Google's AI to seem smart

mspohr writes: Sawyer is one among the thousands of AI workers contracted for Google through Japanese conglomerate Hitachi’s GlobalLogic to rate and moderate the output of Google’s AI products, including its flagship chatbot Gemini, launched early last year, and its summaries of search results, AI Overviews. The Guardian spoke to 10 current and former employees from the firm. Google contracts with other firms for AI rating services as well.“AI isn’t magic; it’s a pyramid scheme of human labor,” said Adio Dinika, a researcher at the Distributed AI Research Institute based in Bremen, Germany. “These raters are the middle rung: invisible, essential and expendable.”She said raters are typically given as little information as possible or that their guidelines changed too rapidly to enforce consistently. “We had no idea where it was going, how it was being used or to what end,” she said, requesting anonymity, as she is still employed at the company.The AI responses she got “could have hallucinations or incorrect answers” and she had to rate them based on factuality – is it true? – and groundedness – does it cite accurate sources? Sometimes, she also handled “sensitivity tasks” that included prompts such as “when is corruption good?” or “what are the benefits to conscripted child soldiers?”

BrianFagioli writes: The Fedora Project has announced Fedora Linux 43 Beta, giving users and developers the opportunity to test the distribution ahead of its final release. This beta introduces improvements across installation, system tools, and programming languages while continuing Fedoraâ(TM)s pattern of cleaning out older components.The beta can be downloaded in Workstation, KDE Plasma, Server, IoT, and Cloud editions. Spins and Labs are also available, though Mate and i3 are not provided in some builds. Existing systems can be upgraded with DNF system-upgrade. Fedora CoreOS will follow one week later through its âoenextâ stream.Installer changes are a major focus in Fedora 43. The Anaconda WebUI is now the default across Spins, creating a consistent and modern setup experience. The installer has also moved to DNF5, replacing DNF4. Support for modular packages has been removed, simplifying the installation process further. Fedora Kinoite now enables automatic updates by default, applying fixes in the background and finalizing them after reboot.Fedora 43 updates its core development tools. The GNU toolchain has been refreshed with gcc 15.2, glibc 2.42, binutils 2.45, and gdb 17.1. LLVM has been updated to version 21. Perl moves to 5.42, and OpenJDK 25 is now the preferred Java version. RPM itself jumps to 6.0, bringing structural changes for packagers. Package maintainers also benefit from new RPM macros for build flags, easing per-package compiler adjustments.On the language front, Python has been updated to version 3.14. Go 1.25 is included, with Golang packages now vendored by default to improve reproducibility. Idris 2 makes its debut, offering advanced type system features. Haskell GHC is updated to 9.8 with Stackage 23. The release also introduces support for the Hare programming language, which is still under development but available for experimentation.Other notable updates include PostgreSQL 18, Ruby on Rails 8.0, MySQL 8.4 as the default version, Dovecot 2.4, and Tomcat 10.1. Fedora CoreOS is now built with Containerfile, allowing Podman users to build locally. Greenboot has been rewritten in Rust, and SELinux handling sees adjustments with reduced âoedontauditâ rules.Fedora 43 also makes graphical and user-facing changes. Noto Color Emoji now uses the newer COLRv1 format, improving scalability. GNOME is now Wayland-only, retiring the old X11 session. The default monospace fallback font has been set to avoid inconsistent text rendering.Deprecated or removed components include the gold linker, python-nose, YASM, legacy GTK Rust bindings, and outdated Python RPM macros tied to setup.py. Packages depending on async-std and python-async-timeout are also being phased out.

UK's MI5 "unlawfully" obtained the communications data of former BBC journalist

Bruce66423 writes: 'Jude Bunting KC, representing Kearney and the BBC, told a hearing on Monday: “The MI5 now confirms publicly that in 2006 and 2009 MI5 obtained communications data in relation to Vincent Kearney.”'He said the security service accepted it had breached Kearney’s rights under article 8 and article 10 of the European convention on human rights. They relate to the right to private correspondence and the right to impart information without interference from public authorities.'“This appears to be the first time in any tribunal proceedings in which MI5 publicly accept interference with a journalist’s communications data, and also publicly accept that they acted unlawfully in doing so,” Bunting said.'He claimed the concessions that it accessed the journalist’s data represented “serious and sustained illegality on the part of MI5”.'The good news is that it's come out. The bad news is that it has taken 16 years to do so. The interesting question is whether there will be any meaningful consequences for individuals within MI5; there's a nice charge of 'malfeasance in public office' which can be used to get such individuals into a criminal court. Or will the outcome be like that of when the CIA hacked the US Senate's computers, lied about it and NOTHING HAPPENED.
