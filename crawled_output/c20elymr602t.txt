Armand Duplantis still looks like he's enjoying competing. He could definitely be forgiven for thinking that he's already done enough in the sport, but he will know what he thinks his potential is. His world record is 6.29m - I think there's only two guys in the world that have cleared 6m this year so we've got a whole ruler gap there.He does bring his best performances to the major championships. He brings the drama and the excitement. He has brought such a highlight to the pole vault event.

I'm not sure we got huge questions answered on how much Jess Hull had in the tank, but she certainly had enough to be able to control that heat with ease.Often when you're coming into these World Championships and you have high expectations for a medal, you just want to come through the first heat smoothly, safely and feeling good.

Jazmin Sawyers has had such a tough year. An Achilles rupture is incredibly difficult to come back from. She didn't just come back though, she came back putting out great jumps and qualifying for the World Championships.So although at this moment she is going to be bitterly disappointed, she can look back at a fantastic season.

Faith Kipyegon has been a talent since becoming a junior athlete. She is going for her fourth World Championship title, she has won over 5000m as well, and she is trying to do the double once again here.She has to be the red-hot favourite. As the rounds progress we will see what shape she's in, but she's already set a world record this year in case we were debating the shape she's in.

Well, that has certainly whet the appetite for tomorrow evening.Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce received a fitting welcome when she was announced to the crowd, and is one of several athletes to produce statement performances.Among them, that season's best run from Daryll Neita is very promising, after she went agonisingly close to achieving a first individual global medal in Paris last summer. You could see how pleased she was with that.And still we have the men's heats to come. Some line up for the opening night.

Marie-Josee Ta Lou-Smith and Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce might be the old-timers, but they can still upset the apple cart. They always manage to sneak their way through with their wealth of experience.Remember, they have both ran under 11 seconds this year. They are still capable of performing when it matters, so they will be happy to be through to the next round."

Great Britain's Amy Hunt has been speaking to BBC Sport after coming through her women's 100m heat: "We knew it was going to be a really long hold and set after the practice yesterday, but that was a very long hold! Today was all about getting my name on that start-board, I really didn't care about anybody else's name I just wanted to see my own name in that top three - and that's the job that I did today."We always see that I warm-up through the rounds but I think that was a pretty solid heat run for me so I'm pretty happy. I'm just trying to get back as quick as possible and roll on the recovery for tomorrow."I had some really lit starts in the warm-ups but I need to actually be able to do that in the race and not just in the warm-ups, so we'll see if I can put it together a bit better tomorrow. I'm just happy to be through."

Great Britain's Daryll Neita has been speaking to BBC Sport after progressing through the women's 100m heats: "It was seriously amazing out there. I have such good memories here in Tokyo. I went to sub-11 seconds for the first time here and I made my first Olympic final here."Just to come here and execute like that in my first race, after what has been a season, is showing myself that it's all about trusting and believing. I'll let the running do the talking for the rest of these World Championships."When I came out here, I just had goosebumps because this place holds such special memories for me and my career. I feel good and I'm just going to head back, recover and get ready for tomorrow."Image source, PA Media

Daryll Neita knew that if she just ran her own race, she would qualify. That's the luxury of her position at the minute.She has raced everywhere and she has found out where she needs to make alterations to arrive at these World Championships in tip-top condition. She has been here before, and made the finals on numerous occasions, so she knows exactly what's necessary.This was a very good and competent run from Neita - a season best when it matters. I don't think that's the best we're going to see from her either.

Control is what it's all about for Julien Alfred and she's definitely just shown that.There were no real nerves or anxiety for her so she wasn't going to be the sharpest out of the blocks because it's not necessary. She already knows she has the strength and the 10.70s in her belt, so it wasn't going to be an issue if she slept in the blocks but she didn't even do that.It's great to see how she's controlling the 100m running. She loves to put her foot on the gas from 20 to 40 metres and it looked like she was just brushing out some of the cobwebs.
