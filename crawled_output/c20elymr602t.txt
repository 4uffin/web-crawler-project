United States' Melissa Jefferson-Wooden has been speaking to BBC Sport after her women's 100m heat: "It feels good to be back on the track. I've been here about a week now so I've just been waiting around getting ready to run. We've got the first run out of the way so now it's time to get ready for the semi-finals and then move on to the finals."I don't believe I'm the one that needs to be catching everyone else. I'm not a reigning Olympic champion in the 100m so I'm still seeking those titles. Obviously this year is the World Championships, so that's what I've been looking forward to."

Time for the world champion - here's Sha'Carri Richardson.She hasn't got the top season best in heat three - that goes to Anthaya Charlton of the Bahamas with 10.87 seconds, marginally quicker than Jamaica's Shericka Jackson with 10.88 and somewhat better than Richardson's 11.05.It's tight between Richardson and Jackson, but the former takes it with a push in the latter half of the race to win with a time of 11.03 seconds, one hundredth ahead of the Jamaican.Charlton finishes fifth, it's unlikely she'll move forward.

Tina Clayton looked very comfortable. It looked very effortless for her to run 11.01 and execute that performance.Dina Asher-Smith looked very good as well. She looked comfortable and controlled. I'm very pleased with that 11.07, she was only a metre off her best this season and she looked like she was cruising. A very good sign for her.

It's been a long, long road back to this point for Jazmin Sawyers.After winning her first international long jump title at the European indoors in 2023, jumping seven metres for the first time in the process, she ruptured her Achilles early last year.That kept the 31-year-old out of action for 20 months before she made her return this summer.She joined the BBC at the Paris Olympics last summer as a television commentator, but here she is back doing what she loves most.

Melissa Jefferson-Wooden has been phenomenal all year. When you're recording victories consistently, you're just gaining confidence upon confidence.At that 60-metre mark, even though there were people around her, she just managed to ease away and accelerate without any effort. That's what you want to do when you're heading for the big prize, which of course is the world title.She is the favourite in many people's eyes because she hasn't put a foot wrong this year.

Melissa Jefferson-Wooden came through that heat so easily. That's how she has been running all year, just making it look so easy.It looked to me as though that was a half-hearted effort, putting in just enough to be able to glide through that last 30 to 40 metres.

Sha'Carri Richardson of the United States is the world champion, but the 25-year-old is yet to break the 11-second mark this season and has had a challenging year off the field.Perhaps the favourite for the event is Richardson's compatriot Melissa Jefferson-Wooden - she's unbeaten over the distance this year with five of the six best times.And what of the Brits?

The weather in Tokyo so far this week has been... interesting?Since team BBC Sport touched down a few days ago we've swung from sweltering heat and stifling humidity to apocalyptic thunderstorms and back again.Today, although the cloud has provided protection from the sun, the humidity has been well above 90% and we saw the physical toll that can take on athletes during this morning's 35km race walk events.Many could not finish the race, while others collapsed at the finish line after their gruelling ordeal.Thankfully, organisers have been well prepared, with medical assistance on hand and plenty of cooling spots dotted around the stadium providing mist sprays and cooling packs to supporters.Temperatures remained around 30C as we started the first evening session.
