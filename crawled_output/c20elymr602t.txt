There were a lot of questions around whether the mixed relay is a good addition, but over the past few years we've seen that it is a great way to start the World Championships. Great Britain are doing fantastic in this event, so we definitely want to see it keep going!The United States and the Netherlands obviously have very strong teams, but Great Britain are looking great. I'm excited to see what they can produce here and hopefully they come away with a medal.
