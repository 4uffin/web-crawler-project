Germany's Fredrik Ruppert won the Diamond League Final a fortnight ago.In heat three there's a head-to-head between the two event favourites: world record holder Lamecha
Girma of Ethiopia and Moroccoâs Soufiane El Bakkali, who is the only male track athlete to win
individual global gold in the same event for four consecutive years. Girma has competed just once since
suffering concussion in a horror fall 200m from the end of the Olympic final. The top five from each heat qualify for the final on Monday.

At the World Athletics Championships, athletes are able to try different things. If things have gone well in the Olympics then great but if they haven't gone well then this is the opportunity to make up for things.Those that did do well at the Olympics can relax. They are going to be announced as the Olympic champions all year round and they will want to perform like that.

Back in the UK, many of us have very fond memories of London 2012. But for Japan, Tokyo 2020 could not have felt much different.On the eve of the championships, the president of Japan Athletics, Yuko Arimori, became emotional when discussing the significance of these championships for Tokyo and the nation."Sport isn't just about the athletes but about everyone getting energy from it and lifting each other up, and I think that kind of energy is important," she said."I think this event will help us wipe away the emotions we felt back then and remind us what sport should be like. Athletics is the mother of sports and I want people to take inspiration from it."With each sighting of the bright orange Japanese vest cheered loudly by a well-attended first morning session, the streets lined for the 35km race walk events and Hayato Katsuki delivering Japan's first medal, the early signs suggest the host nation is keen to make up for lost time.

The athletes will need coping strategies to physically deal with this heat and humidity.Most of them will have strategic plans coming into the World Athletics Championships but it is also quite hard mentally because you're going through your events, you're dehydrating and you're feeling so tired when you need to be at your strongest.It's just about being on those hydration strategies and trying to keep yourself as cool as possible throughout the days.

The conditions that I've been preparing for were a lot hotter but I think the humidity just makes it so hard on your body. My body just really suffered out there."I tried to use the motivation of other people slowing down and other people dropping out to just think to myself that I need to take it one lap at a time. I was just focusing on ticking the laps off and trying to match anyone that I could with the little bit of energy that I did have."
