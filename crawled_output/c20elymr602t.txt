Great Britain's Scott Lincoln speaking to BBC Sport earlier after qualifying for the shot put final: "It was a nervy one but I'm through to my first world final. Here we are, how do you like your eggs? I've made big changes and taken a big risk but I'm starting to get the rewards now, hopefully. I'm happy with what I've thrown but I still feel there's more I can do in the final."I'll go all out in this final, what have I got to lose? This year in particular, I think the medal is anyone's. There are definitely medals up for grabs, so why not me?"

He will have watched all of these athletes perform in the past as a young teenager, but he wants to go and compete with them now.He was out of the blocks so quick and strong, he was just gathering more and more pace by 40 metres, his eyes were straight in front.Zharnel Hughes was nice and controlled.

I think I got out quite well, transitioned quite well and then I just maintained it. I didn't want to leave it to chance so I wanted to make sure I qualified in the top three."It's been a couple of weeks since I last raced so it was all about getting back in that rhythm and I did that. It felt good and the track is quick. I'm ready to roll and excited for what's next. I'm confident in my abilities."

Jeremiah Azu did so well. He would've got this start-list last night, looked at it and thought he's going to have to work his way into the heat to qualify outright.He did such a tremendous job. He got out the blocks very well and he just maintained it, even with a lot of good people around him. That's going to be key for him - he has to know his competition well but also trust himself.He didn't stress or strain, he just kept his focus on the prize. A solid performance.

Noah Lyles did very well there - 9.95 seconds is a very decent run indeed from him.He said he's going to race his way through these World Championships because he hasn't had that many races this season. It works well for him having so many rounds because he can really gather pace throughout.He has definitely got something building.

Great Britain's Laura Muir has been speaking to BBC Sport after failing to qualify in the women's 1500m heats: "I don't know what happened and I think that's the most upsetting thing. I feel like I've had a bit of a disrupted year but I was coming into form really well. I was excited with the shape that I was in so I was definitely aiming to make the final and be competitive in that final. I'm not too sure what went wrong, to be honest, which is the most upsetting thing."I did realise something wasn't quite right with 500 metres to go, I tried to just put it to the back of my mind but it showed in that last 100 metres."When Faith [Kipyegon] went to the front I didn't realise she was going to push on, so I just sat on her shoulders so that I was out of harm's way. I think I ran a really good race apart from the last 100 metres."This has probably been the hardest journey I've had to get to the World Championships, so to have gone out in the first round makes it really difficult."To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.This video can not be playedMedia caption, Shock as GB's Muir crashes out of 1500m

Kishane Thompson is such a big and powerful guy. He kind of rocks and rolls as he gets up and gets into that drive-phase, then he starts to smooth out as those legs of his really come to the forefront.Once he gets up to that top speed, it is very impressive. He didn't need it all here, in fact he eased right back at the end of that heat.

Great Britain's Romell Glave has been speaking to BBC Sport after equalling his personal best in the men's 100m heat one: "It was good. The start was a bit confusing because Oblique [Seville] didn't get out so I thought there was going to be a call-back, but I was just able to continue on. I did tighten up at the end but I still went and equalled my personal best."It was a bit of a weird situation at the start because I was wondering if he was going to call it back. You just have to get on with things and hopefully I get through now. I just have to see how everyone else does."

Kishane Thompson, the 2024 Olympic silver medallist, goes in heat two - he was pipped by Noah Lyles in an incredibly tight finish.He has an
unrivalled five sub-9.90 times this year - Lyles has none - but missed the final three Diamond League meetings last month due to discomfort
in his shin.No issues here, he's powered ahead of the field by half way, takes a look around and slows down over the line, still finishing with a time of 9.95 seconds.

Oblique Seville was literally sleeping in the blocks. His reaction time was more like that of an 800m runner rather than a sprinter.When you're a quality athlete like that, at least he has the ability to haul himself back in and run down people that are running personal bests left, right and centre.Romell Glave running 10 seconds flat in fourth-place - wow. It's shocking that he even has to wait to see if he qualifies, but unfortunately that's what's got to happen.

Laura Muir was showing some really good signs coming into these World Championships. She came second in the British Championships to qualify for Tokyo, which was amazing, and she did it with a sprint finish. More recently, she came fourth in the Brussels Diamond League.It was such a shame to see her fade towards the end of that race. It will be interesting to hear what happened from her perspective.Very disappointing. She did well to make this team but then we were expecting her to at least make the semi-final.
