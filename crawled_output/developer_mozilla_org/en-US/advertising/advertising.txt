Join MDN's Privacy-First Ad Journey
At MDN, we champion user privacy and we stand by
Mozilla's Ad targeting guidelines. We pride ourselves with an ethical advertising approach that
ensures ads are context-based, free from tracking pixels, and
don't involve personal data sharing.
While we understand that advertisers rely on attribution to
gauge campaign effectiveness, we also find that current methods
pose privacy concerns. In line with our vision of protecting
user privacy and personal data, Mozilla is part of a working
group to develop Interoperable Private Attribution (IPA), a
privacy-preserving attribution solution. We aim to enable
attribution without tracking, enhancing ad quality and value.
Until this becomes a reality, we are working with advertising
partners who support our privacy goals. For now, that means
collaborating without attribution and developing a better way
together.

in this journey!
Our offering
We collaborate with vetted advertisers who share our vision for
web development. We display at most two static ads per page. We
offer exclusive opportunities for prominent homepage visibility,
providing advertisers a unique way to capture our audience's
attention. We are also happy to collaborate on writing and
publishing sponsored content on our blog.
Our audience
MDN is a go-to resource for over 17 million web developers
monthly, providing open-source documentation on CSS, HTML,
JavaScript, and Web APIs. We boast 90% customer satisfaction and
