Media
Audio and video delivery
We can deliver audio and video on the web in several ways, ranging from 'static' media files to adaptive live streams. This article is intended as a starting point for exploring the various delivery mechanisms of web-based media and compatibility with popular browsers.
Audio and video manipulation
The beauty of the web is that you can combine technologies to create new forms. Having native audio and video in the browser means we can use these data streams with technologies such as <canvas>, WebGL or Web Audio API to modify audio and video directly, for example adding reverb/compression effects to audio, or grayscale/sepia filters to video. This article provides a reference to explain what you need to do.
APIs
Using FormData objects
The FormData object lets you compile a set of key/value pairs to send using fetch(). It's primarily intended for sending form data, but can be used independently of forms to transmit keyed data. The transmission is in the same format that the form's submit() method would use to send the data if the form's encoding type were set to "multipart/form-data".
Progressive web apps
Progressive web apps (PWAs) use modern web APIs along with traditional progressive enhancement strategy to create cross-platform web applications. These apps work everywhere and provide several features that give them the same user experience advantages as native apps. This set of guides tells you all you need to know about PWAs.
Parsing and serializing XML
The web platform provides different methods of parsing and serializing XML, each with its pros and cons.
