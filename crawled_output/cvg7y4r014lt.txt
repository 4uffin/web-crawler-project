Archer has his third! Pace off, plinked back by Marco Jansen, and Archer clings on low to the ground in his follow-through. England are closing in.

Given the amount of runs on show today, Curran has bowled exceptionally. He was player of the tournament when we won the T20 world cup a few years ago, it's great to have him back in the side.Jack

2-11 from two overs for Sam Curran. During a run-fest like this, that's sensational.

Very good from Sam Curran. He's bowled a hell of an over there. So well thought out - and that's one of his strengths.

Sam Curran continues to impress on his England return. Short ball, top-edged by Ferreira, and Jos Buttler does the rest. An entertaining cameo of 23 from 11 balls, the sort of thing that's required of him as the team's finisher, but nowhere near enough for this chase.

Donovan Ferreira has improved year-on-year facing spin as a T20 batter, showing he's more than just your typical finisher.
2023 - 14.7 average, 145 strike rate
2024 - 29.4 average, 154 strike rate
2025 - 99.0 average, 184 strike rate

It's been an unbelievably high-scoring game.England have bowled really well and South Africa are giving it a hell of a go.To still be switched on and try and get as many as they can will help them in the rest of the series.

Back-to-back fours to end the over and there's the 20 runs from it.Just need to put 10 more of those together...

That was absolutely massive.Another yard and that would have been out of the stadium.Very rare you see that at Old Trafford. The crowd here have had their money's worth tonight.

My word, Donovan Ferreira can hit the ball hard.This one pings off the roof of the hotel and into the stands below. Watch out in the crowd...

Another tidy over from Liam Dawson despite the first ball being clubbed for six by Tristan Stubbs.The run rate is approaching 20 per over for South Africa.

A wicket and just four runs from Rashid's opening over. Indispensable.

He knows his team's fate is inevitable.

That was a really good over from Liam Dawson under pressure, and he's set it up nicely for Adil Rashid.

Liam Dawson drags it back. That's experience for you.

That's absolutely huge. Liam Dawson has given that a little bit of flight and he's been smashed down the ground.

How will South Africa play Liam Dawson here?Well, there's an early indication. A monstrous six from Aiden Markram flies down the ground.

In normal circumstances, South Africa are going at a decent rate. But obviously, these are far from normal circumstances. England dominate the powerplay again - they were 100-0 at the end of theirs.
