I hope Aidan Markram's getting around his young bowlers here because they've been smacked everywhere. They're getting pummelled.

Aiden Markram is talking to his players in a huddle at the drinks break. From their perspective this has been the cricketing equivalent of that cheese-chasing race on a hill in middle England.A mess.

Drinks break, time machine, a massive sink hole to appear in the middle of Old Trafford. South Africa would take any of the above.

South Africa need the drinks break here.

Again, Phil Salt gets four. The only good thing about this one for Maphaka is he's not been taken out by the ball in his follow-through.

19-year-old Kwena Maphaka is the latest to step up and try to do something, anything, to stop the torrent of runs. His first delivery is a sharp bouncer but the next two are whipped for four by Phil Salt.

This is some welcome back to international cricket for Lizaad Williams.

Phil Salt drags another for four to add more misery to Lizaad Williams' day. The seamer ends sprawled in the dirt too, having fallen in his delivery stride. Williams has conceded 46 in two overs.

It's been some magnificent striking from Phil Salt so far, and you feel like he's not done yet.

Rebuild after the loss of a wicket? That is not in Phil Salt's dictionary.

This is about the time someone texts us to say 'here comes the collapse...'.Jacob Bethell is off the mark.

That's one of those as a batter when you're striking the ball the way he is, you question how you've found that fielder. He's smacked so many good deliveries. What a platform he's set for England here.

Jos Buttler can't believe what he has done. He's managed to ping a leg-stump half-volley to the fielder at deep square-leg.Still Old Trafford rises to appreciate a brilliant 83 from 30 balls.

Yep, there's another.England's fastest T20 century is 42 balls by Liam Livingstone. Jos Buttler could knock it around for singles and still beat that.

I don't want to criticse bowlers too much in this situation. England may as well be batting on the M60.This, though, is a pie from spinner Bjorn Fortuin. Buttler helps himself again.
