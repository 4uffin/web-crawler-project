About PubMed
PubMed is a free resource supporting the search and retrieval of biomedical
and life sciences literature with the aim of improving health–both globally and
personally.
PubMed contains more than 39 million citations and abstracts of biomedical literature.
It does not include full text journal articles;
however, links to the full text are often present when available from other sources,
such as the publisher's website or
PubMed Central (PMC).
Available to the public online since 1996, PubMed was developed and is maintained by the
National Center for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI), at the
U.S. National Library of Medicine
(NLM), located at the
National Institutes of Health (NIH).
About the Content
Citations in PubMed primarily stem from the biomedicine and health fields, and related
disciplines such as life sciences, behavioral sciences, chemical sciences, and
bioengineering.
PubMed facilitates searching across several NLM literature resources:
MEDLINE
MEDLINE is the largest
component of PubMed and consists primarily of citations from journals selected
for MEDLINE; articles indexed with MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) and curated
with funding, genetic, chemical and other metadata.
PubMed Central (PMC)
Citations for PubMed
Central (PMC) articles make up the second largest component of
PubMed.
PMC is a full text archive that includes articles from journals reviewed and
selected by NLM for archiving (current and historical), as well as individual
articles collected for archiving in compliance with funder policies.
Bookshelf
The final component of PubMed is citations for books and some individual chapters
available on Bookshelf.
Bookshelf is a full text archive of books, reports, databases, and other
documents related to biomedical, health, and life sciences.
