Annual baseline
Once a year, NLM produces a baseline set of PubMed citation records in XML format
for download; the baseline file is a complete snapshot of PubMed data. When using
this data in a local database, the best practice is to overwrite your local data
each year with the baseline data.
Daily update files
Each day, NLM produces update files that include new, revised, and deleted
citations. If you are incorporating these update XML files into a local database,
load the baseline files first, then load the daily update files in numerical order.
Revised or deleted citations should replace existing citations in your local
database. More than one update file may become available on the same day.
