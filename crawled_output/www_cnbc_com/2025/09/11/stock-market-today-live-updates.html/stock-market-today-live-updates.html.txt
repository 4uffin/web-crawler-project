The broad market S&P 500 hovered around the flatline, down just 0.05% to finish at 6,584.29. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 273.78 points, or 0.59%, to close at 45,834.22. Having each closed at record levels Thursday, with the Dow finishing above 46,000 for the first time, the three major averages rounded out the weekly period with gains.The S&P 500, which rose 1.6% week to date, saw its best weekly performance since early August and its fifth positive week in six. The Nasdaq secured its second winning week in a row with its 2% advance in the period, and the Dow posted its first positive week in three after seeing a week-to-date climb of 1%.Investors are now gearing up for the Fed's decision on whether it will lower its benchmark interest rate on Sept. 17. Futures markets are pricing in a quarter percentage point cut with near certainty, according to the CME FedWatch tool.The economic data released this week would support such a decision, according to Bill Northey, investment director at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. The consumer price index came in slightly hotter than expected for August on Thursday, but the usually crucial inflation report was overshadowed by weekly jobless claims, which showed an unexpected jump to the highest level since October 2021.Those reports, as well as the downward revisions on job growth from the Bureau of Labor Statistics earlier this week, further confirm a "decelerating labor market" and that inflation "remains well contained," which "really sets up for a cut next week," Northey told CNBC."This is a Fed that is reluctant to surprise markets, and so as expectations have cemented around that 25 basis point rate cut, we think that they'll deliver against that," he said.Northey added that through the Fed's press conference and its summary of economic projections, investors should be given more clarity on the central bank's median view regarding its outlook for both economic growth and inflation, along with what it considers appropriate in terms of monetary policy positioning against that."All three of those elements really play into what happens further out the interest rate curve," he continued. "This should be a very information-rich meeting that we see [in] the middle of next week."Fri, Sep 12 20254:19 PM EDTNasdaq scores another record closeThe Nasdaq Composite finished higher on Friday, scoring a new all-time intraday and closing high during the session.The tech-heavy index jumped 0.44% to finish at 22,141.10, its fifth closing high this week.Meanwhile, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished lower by 0.05% and 273.78 points, or 0.59%, to end at 6,584.29 and 45,834.22, respectively.— Sean ConlonFri, Sep 12 20253:26 PM EDT Micron Technology soars to record highMicron Technology hit a record high of $158.28 per share on Friday. The computer and memory storage firm's shares are surging as the artificial intelligence industry booms. Citi analysts raised Micron's price target to $175 from $150, citing an upturn in the memory storage market fueled by strong demand for DRAM chips and other hardware that helps power AI solutions. Micron supplies hardware to a variety of AI-industry heavyweights, including Intel.The company's stock was last up roughly 4.7% at $157.63, as of 3:26 p.m. ET.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconMU, 1-day— Liz NapolitanoFri, Sep 12 20252:54 PM EDTAll eyes are on what Fed Chair Powell says next weekWhat Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell says about the path of monetary easing next week will be critical to a stock market that's been insistent on interest rate cuts.The Fed meeting next week is a critical one. Investors are certain the central bank will have to cut rates for the first time since December at the conclusion of its Sept. 16-17 meeting, with some even hopeful for a jumbo half-percentage point cut. Not only that, the latest Summary of Economic Projections is also due, giving insight into how policymakers are thinking through monetary policy.Lower rates can turbocharge an already surging stock market. However, risks on the economic front — particularly in the labor market — are becoming more apparent. Those worries are starting to show up elsewhere, such as in the bond market or in the rise in gold. This week, the short end of the yield curve moved higher, while the long end moved lower, a development investors worry could start affecting equities."The whole yield curve is shifting down, but the curve is changing shape as well," said Mark Malek, investment chief at Siebert Financial. "It's possible that people really are concerned. Starting to get worried that these employment numbers are the seeds of what could be an economic slowdown."Read more here.— Sarah MinFri, Sep 12 20252:26 PM EDTGemini stock soars more than 40% in Nasdaq debutGemini Co-founders Tyler Winklevoss and Cameron Winklevoss attend the company's IPO at the Nasdaq MarketSite in New York City, U.S., Sept. 12, 2025.

Jeremy Siegel, WisdomTree chief economist and Wharton professor emeritus, believes traders will continue to bet on those names heading into the end of the year and diversify into smaller names as Fed easing begins to take place."[Investors] may be worried very much about how is their year-to-date performance going to look on December 31st," Siegel said Friday on CNBC's 'Squawk on the Street.' "We might see AI and AI-related stocks remain very, very strong to year end," he continued. "That being said, if the market believes there is going to be three cuts and a couple more next year, I think there's really a good case for that broadening out also. You'll see the small stocks — which are very, very linked to that interest rate expectation — probably continue to do well."— Pia SinghFri, Sep 12 20251:01 PM EDTSix Flags Entertainment, Tesla among the stocks making midday movesA view shows Tesla superchargers at the supercharging station in Escondido, California, U.S., July 3, 2025.

It also tweaked its price target for VMEO to $7.85 from $8 per share.The revision comes as Vimeo awaits its pending acquisition by Bending Spoons, a private Italian technology conglomerate. Truist's downgrade is due in part because that deal does not include a go-shop provision that would allow Vimeo to seek higher bids from other potential buyers.Vimeo shares have fallen roughly 90% since its public market debut in 2021, largely due to the company's difficulties keeping up with rising competition in its sector.— Liz NapolitanoFri, Sep 12 202511:22 AM EDTJPMorgan sees more than 50% upside ahead for American AirlinesShares of American Airlines are poised to move significantly higher as demand continues to cover, according to JPMorgan.The bank maintained its overweight rating on the stock and established a December 2026 price target of $20, implying 54% upside from Thursday's close.While its balance sheet is not "fixed," American Airlines' move towards deleveraging has removed significant overhang, analyst James Baker said in a note Thursday. Its low capital spend has provided a runway for further improvement, he said."Additionally, the leverage should benefit AAL's share price in a continued demand recovery, particularly as international continues to accelerate ahead of domestic," he wrote.
