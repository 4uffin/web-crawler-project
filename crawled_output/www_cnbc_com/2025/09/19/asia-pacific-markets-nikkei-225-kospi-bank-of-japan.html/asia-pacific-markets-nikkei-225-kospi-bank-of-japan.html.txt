People crossing the street in Shibuya, Tokyo.Maydays | Moment | Getty ImagesJapan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index pared gains to fall 0.57% Friday, after the Bank of Japan kept its policy rate steady at 0.5%, in line with the forecast from a Reuters poll of economists.The benchmark index had hit a fresh record high for a second consecutive session earlier in the day. The index closed at 45,045.81, while the Japanese yen appreciated by 0.14% against the dollar to 147.80.The decision to hold rates comes as Japan's core inflation rate in August fell to its lowest since November 2024 at 2.7%, marking a third straight month of decline.The core inflation figure — which strips out prices of fresh food — was in line with the 2.7% expected by economists polled by Reuters. Headline inflation in the country also dropped to 2.7%, coming down from 3.1% in July and marking a fresh low since November 2024."The Bank of Japan's decision to hold rates steady underscores its cautious stance amid slowing inflation and global uncertainty – prioritizing stability over premature tightening," said Hiroaki Amemiya, investment director at Capital Group. "By preserving policy optionality, the BoJ is signaling its readiness to respond to external volatility while continuing to assess the strength of Japan's economic recovery.""The BoJ's strategy supports the early stages of a reflationary cycle, rather than reversing course," Amemiya added.Yields on Japan's 2-year government bonds rose to 0.885%, marking the highest since June 2008, LSEG data showed.Meanwhile, the Topix declined 0.35% to close at 3,147.68Australia's ASX/S&P 200 climbed 0.32% to end the trading day at 8,773.5.
