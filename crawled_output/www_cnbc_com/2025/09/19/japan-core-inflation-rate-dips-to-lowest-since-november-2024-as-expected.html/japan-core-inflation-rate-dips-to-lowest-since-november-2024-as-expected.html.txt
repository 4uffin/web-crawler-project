We continue to see value in sectors such as Japan's industrials, manufacturing and automobile sectors – industries well-positioned to navigate trade headwinds and benefit from global supply chain shifts."There are, however, growing calls for the BOJ to raise rates as Japan's headline inflation stays above the bank's 2% target for over three years.In a Sep 12 note, HSBC analysts had pointed out Japan's elevated inflationary pressure — driven by high rice prices — is also prompting louder calls for further rate hikes.Senior Liberal Democratic Party member Taro Kono had reportedly said on Sept. 9 that "if the Bank of Japan delays a rate increase, I think it would mean inflation will continue and everything we import would be higher."But Junyu Tan, economist for North Asia at trade credit risk management firm Coface, held a different view, telling CNBC Friday that the high headline inflation has been "largely distorted by supply constraints and influenced by exogenous factors such as a weak yen and commodity price strength."Key domestic demand metrics, particularly service price growth, remain below target and have not risen fast enough to convince the BOJ to decisively shift its stance, he added.Subscribe to CNBC PROSubscribe to Investing ClubLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSelect Personal FinanceCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelSupply Chain ValuesClosed CaptioningDigital ProductsNews ReleasesInternshipsCorrectionsAbout CNBCAd ChoicesSite MapPodcastsCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?
