Last Friday, JD.com — one of China's largest ecommerce platforms — saw the first minute of iPhone 17 series preorders surpass the first-day preorder volume of last year's iPhone 16 series, the company reported. At 10 a.m. local time on Friday, JD.com said that iPhone 17 trade-in sales were four times higher than the same period last year.Other markets In the much smaller but affluent market of Singapore, the redesigned iPhone 17s were also met with fervor, with long lines forming outside Apple outlets across the city. Iman Isa and Daniel Muhamed Nuv, two young professionals in Singapore, both queued for hours at Apple's outlet in the city's iconic Marina Bay mall to buy iPhone 17 Pros, which they said were their first new phones in years. Citing the fresh design, longer battery life and improved camera, they said the new phones offer enough to keep them loyal to the Apple ecosystem.watch nowVIDEO7:0907:09WSJ’s Tim Higgins: Apple is facing a situation similar to the one Microsoft faced a generation agoSquawk BoxBased on preorder times and consumer feedback, the initial global demand for the iPhone 17 series appears largely positive, said Le Xuan Chiew, a research manager at Omdia.The iPhone 17 base model in particular has outperformed expectations, as the pricing at launch remained unchanged from its predecessor despite upgrades in memory storage, Chiew said. In Singapore, customers arriving at Apple outlets had also been looking to nab some of the company's new AirPods Pro 3, citing the product's live translation feature as a major selling point.In London, lines were notably longer than they were at last year's launch of the iPhone 16, and customers appeared more interested in the premium offerings — the Pro and Pro Max models — this time around.People lined up outside Apple's Regent Street, London store on Sept. 19 to get their hands on the latest iPhone 17.Arjun Kharpal | CNBC"For the last five years, I've been in a pattern of constantly upgrading my phone, because every year Apple is bringing something new to the table," one customer, Jasmine, said. "I just love having that experience of Apple every year."Meanwhile, Michael, who described himself as a content creator, said he was drawn by the battery and camera."I thought about going for the [iPhone] Air, but I just don't know whether or not the battery is going to be able to hold up. And that single camera? I don't know, it's just a little bit off-putting on the back," he said of Apple's thin iPhone 17 offering.Apple intelligence A successful iPhone 17 launch could help reassure Apple investors after a somewhat underwhelming rollout of its artificial intelligence features, which began late last year.Speaking to CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe" last week, Ben Wood, chief analyst at CCS Insight, lauded Apple's latest product launches but said the company now needed to deliver on artificial intelligence. watch nowVIDEO5:2405:24'Apple need to deliver on AI': says analystSquawk Box Europe"There is no question that Apple needs to deliver on AI," he said, noting that the company had "dropped the ball" last year by making big promises that failed to materialize."Apple has to catch up [in AI], but right now, I think they've got enough runway to be able to cope in the intervening period."- CNBC's Arjun Kharpal and Eunice Yoon contributed to this reportSubscribe to CNBC PROSubscribe to Investing ClubLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSelect Personal FinanceCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelSupply Chain ValuesClosed CaptioningDigital ProductsNews ReleasesInternshipsCorrectionsAbout CNBCAd ChoicesSite MapPodcastsCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?
