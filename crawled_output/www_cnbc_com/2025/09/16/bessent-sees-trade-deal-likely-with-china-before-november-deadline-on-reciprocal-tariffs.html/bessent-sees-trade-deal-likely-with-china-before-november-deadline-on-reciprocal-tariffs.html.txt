"Each one of those talks has become more and more productive. I think the Chinese now sense that a trade deal is possible."The statement comes with talks taking a series of twists and turns since Trump announced his initial "liberation day" duties on U.S. global trading partners April 2.Under the initial move, China would have faced tariffs up to 145%, but those were suspended as talks continued. An initial pause on reciprocal tariffs was to expire on Aug. 12, but Trump extended the suspension to Nov. 10.Bessent said he has been told by U.S. trading partners that "Chinese goods are flooding their markets, and they don't know what to do about it. They're slightly apoplectic that these goods are coming in."The U.S. had a nearly $300 billion trade deficit with China in 2024. That's on pace to decline significantly in 2025 and was at $128 billion through July. Bessent noted that U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer expects the deficit "will narrow by at least 30% this year and probably more in 2026.""So the idea here is to come into balance, to have fair trade," he said.Subscribe to CNBC PROSubscribe to Investing ClubLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSelect Personal FinanceCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelSupply Chain ValuesClosed CaptioningDigital ProductsNews ReleasesInternshipsCorrectionsAbout CNBCAd ChoicesSite MapPodcastsCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?
