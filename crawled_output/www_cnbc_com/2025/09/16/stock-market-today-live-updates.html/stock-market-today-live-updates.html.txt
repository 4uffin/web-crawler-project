Fed Chairman Jerome Powell tempered enthusiasm a bit by signaling the move was not the start of a long rate-lowering cycle.The broad-market index settled down 0.1% at 6,600.35, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.3% to 22,261.33. The Dow finished up 260.42 points, or 0.6%, at 46,018.32, after earlier hitting an all-time high.Shares of high-flying tech stocks led the losses following the Fed decision as investors took profits on the bull market winners. Nvidia, Oracle, Palantir and Broadcom each closed lower. On the positive side, stocks that would benefit from lower rates were in the green, boosting the Dow and the broader market. Shares of Walmart, JPMorgan and American Express were higher during the session.One of the biggest winners of the day was the small cap-focused Russell 2000, which jumped 0.18%. Smaller companies rely more on variable financing and so stand to benefit from lower rates.The Federal Open Market Committee lowered its benchmark overnight lending rate by a quarter percentage point in an 11 to 1 vote, putting the overnight funds rate in a range between 4%-4.25%. The central bank also signaled two interest rate cuts will be implemented during the remainder of the year.The Fed noted recent sluggishness in the labor market in its statement. "Job gains have slowed, and the unemployment rate has edged up but remains low," the committee noted in its post-meeting statement, which also noted that economic activity has "moderated" and inflation "has moved up and remains somewhat elevated."Possibly disappointing traders was a Powell comment in his press conference after the decision where he characterized the move as a "risk management cut." Powell's comments suggest this move was more of an insurance cut in case the economy dramatically slowed."There are no risk-free paths now. It's not incredibly obvious what to do," Powell said.What's more, the central bank gave a hawkish outlook for rates in 2026, where officials are predicting only one more rate cut in the new year, slower than the current market pricing of two-to-three. To be sure, the Fed's so-called dot plot shows a large variance of opinion for the next year."Net, net, Fed officials did not hit the panic button as they chose to cut rates by the smallest possible magnitude at the September meeting," said Christopher S. Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS. "The one rate cut per meeting pace shows they no longer feel tariff-based inflation is a serious threat and that the economic growth slowdown with companies onboarding fewer new employees is increasingly the bigger risk. Stagflation is out and labor market concerns are moved to the front-burner."Major U.S. indexes rallied ahead of Wednesday's decision. The S&P 500 is up 2.2% month to date, while the Nasdaq has jumped 3.8% on a surge in artificial intelligence-related stocks. The Dow is up 1% this month.Wed, Sep 17 20254:03 PM EDTDow closes more than 250 points higher while S&P, Nasdaq lagWednesday saw a volatile trading session after the Federal Reserve decision and policy outlook.The S&P 500 lost 0.10% to close at 6,600.35. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 260.42 points, or 0.57%, ending at 46,018.32. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.33% to settle the session at 22,261.33.— Pia SinghWed, Sep 17 20253:32 PM EDTDeutsche Bank hikes 2026 gold forecastWith gold prices having scored a fresh record this week, Deutsche Bank now sees even more room to run for the commodity.On Wednesday, the firm raised its 2026 forecast on gold prices Wednesday to an average of $4,000 an ounce. That comes after gold prices hit a record of $3,702.95 Tuesday, surpassing the firm's previous forecast."With gold having reached our 2026 forecast (USD 3,700/oz), we believe that the FX and rates environment remain conducive to further upside, while positioning indicators are not stretched," analyst Michael Hsueh wrote. "Although gold has screened as rich versus fair value, we think much of this is due to the strength of official demand, which we expect to persist."— Sean ConlonWed, Sep 17 20253:23 PM EDTRussell 2000 nears all-time closing highThe Russell 2000 is within striking distance of its record closing high following Wednesday's rally.The small cap-focused index climbed 0.5% in late afternoon trading. The index is now around 1% away from its closing all-time high record notched in November 2021.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconRussell 2000, all-time chart— Alex Harring, Nick WellsWed, Sep 17 20252:42 PM EDTFOMC gives the market 'exactly what it expected,' strategist saysA television station broadcasts the Federal Reserve's decision to cut rates on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, US, on Wednesday, Sept. 17, 2025. Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMajor U.S. stock indexes wavered after the Federal Reserve's rate cut decision Wednesday."The FOMC threw the pitch right down the middle of the plate and gave the market virtually exactly what it expected. A cut at each of the 2 remaining meetings this year syncs perfectly with fed funds futures," said Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute."Only difference in number of cuts is the dots suggest just 1 time next year but the market has been pricing in two cuts….that will have little if any effect on the financial markets….close enough. No surprise there is wide dispersion of projections for next year's policy adjustments," Wren added.— Pia SinghWed, Sep 17 20252:04 PM EDTFederal Reserve cuts rates by a quarter-point, matching forecastThe Federal Reserve lowered its benchmark rate by 25 basis points, or a quarter-percentage point, to a range of 4%-4.25%, as expected by many investors and economists. That marked the first Fed rate cut since December. The central bank also released its latest "dot plot" which showed the central bank expects to lower rates two more times this year. In the post-meeting statement, the committee again characterized economic activity as having "moderated" but added language saying that "job gains have slowed" and noted that inflation "has moved up and remains somewhat elevated." Lower job growth and higher inflation put the Fed's twin goals of stable prices and full employment in conflict."Uncertainty about the economic outlook remains elevated" the statement said. "The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate and judges that downside risks to employment have risen."— Fred Imbert, Jeff CoxWed, Sep 17 20251:36 PM EDTBernstein upgrades Zillow on improving fundamentals and possible rate cutsTiffany Hagler-Geard | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesShares of real estate platform Zillow gained 3.5% on Wednesday after Bernstein upgraded the stock to outperform from market-perform. The Wall Street firm said it's getting more bullish on the company given recent execution on mid-teens revenue growth, improving earnings quality and the prospect of lower interest rates."While we don't assume much help from the housing market, that remains a major potential unlock for earnings upside, with Existing Home Sales running 20-30% below normal," a note from the firm read.Bernstein also hiked its 12-month price target on Zillow by $30 to $105, which represents an upside north of 20% in the stock price.— Yun LiWed, Sep 17 202512:43 PM EDTPut cash to work, UBS saysWhether or not Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell delivers a dovish tilt in his post-meeting address on Wednesday, investors should stay invested given that the path of interest rates is lower, according to UBS. "Any hawkish element in his remarks could challenge investor optimism over future Fed rate cuts and trigger market volatility," Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi, global head of equities at UBS Financial Services, wrote on Wednesday. "For investors, we continue to believe the backdrop of lower rates is positive for quality bonds, equities, and gold," Hoffmann-Burchardi continued. "We recommend putting excess cash to work."
