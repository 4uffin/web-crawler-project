Year-to-date, the company's shares have fallen about 1%.Results from a late-stage study of the drug orforglipron were presented at a European medical meeting and published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The trial enrolled over 3,000 non-diabetic participants who were obese or overweight with a weight-related health problem.Lilly said orforglipron showed clinically meaningful improvements across key cardiovascular risk factors, including cholesterol levels and blood pressure. It said the highest dose of the drug reduced a key marker of inflammation by 47.7%.The most commonly reported side effects were mild-to-moderate and gastrointestinal. The rate of nausea for high-dose patients was 33.7%, compared with 10.4% for placebo patients.In the high-dose orforglipron group, 10.3% of patients dropped out of the trial due to side effects, compared with 2.6% of placebo patients.Lilly said liver safety was thoroughly evaluated and concluded that there was no concerning pattern of liver issues among patients taking the drug. High liver enzyme levels were reported in seven orforglipron patients, but alternative causes were identified, researchers said.During the 72-week trial, three deaths were reported: one low-dose orforglipron patient, one mid-dose patient and one placebo patient.Five cases of mild pancreatitis occurred in orforglipron patients. No cases of medullary thyroid cancer were reported.An increase in the mean pulse rate of 4.3 to 5.3 beats per minute occurred in the orforglipron groups, compared with an increase of 0.8 beat per minute in the placebo group, which researchers said was consistent with findings observed with injected GLP-1 drugs.In a previous 36-week Phase 2 trial, orforglipron was shown to reduce body weight by nearly 15% without an apparent plateau. Researchers said that despite the recent study's 72-week duration, weight reduction was not greater, which could be due to differences in trial design, including more geographic diversity and a higher percentage of men.Subscribe to CNBC PROSubscribe to Investing ClubLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSelect Personal FinanceCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelSupply Chain ValuesClosed CaptioningDigital ProductsNews ReleasesInternshipsCorrectionsAbout CNBCAd ChoicesSite MapPodcastsCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?
