"As you get larger, it's really easy to accumulate bureaucracy, a lot of bureaucracy that you may not see."A year ago, as part of a mandate requiring corporate employees to work in the office five days a week, Jassy set a goal to flatten organizations across Amazon. He called for the company to increase worker-to-manager ratios by at least 15% by the end of the first quarter of this year.Jassy also announced the creation of a "no bureaucracy email alias" so that employees can flag unnecessary processes or excessive rules within the company.Amazon has received about 1,500 emails in the past year, and the company has changed about 455 processes based on that feedback, Jassy said.The changes are linked to Jassy's broad strategy to overhaul Amazon's corporate culture and operate like the "world's largest startup" as it looks to stay competitive.Jassy, who took the helm from founder Jeff Bezos in 2021, has been on a campaign to slash costs across the company in recent years. Amazon has laid off more than 27,000 employees since 2022, and axed some of its more unprofitable initiatives. Jassy has also urged employees to do more with less at the same time that the company invests heavily in artificial intelligence.Transforming Amazon into a startup-like environment isn't an easy task. The company operates sprawling businesses across retail, cloud computing, advertising, and other areas. It's the U.S. second-largest private employer, with more than 1.5 million employees globally."You have to keep remembering your roots and how useful it is to be scrappy," Jassy said.WATCH: Jassy on how AI will change the workforcewatch nowVIDEO11:0811:08AI will change the workforce, says Amazon CEO Andy JassyMad Money with Jim CramerSubscribe to CNBC PROSubscribe to Investing ClubLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSelect Personal FinanceCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelSupply Chain ValuesClosed CaptioningDigital ProductsNews ReleasesInternshipsCorrectionsAbout CNBCAd ChoicesSite MapPodcastsCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?
