The extension, as described in an executive order, precludes the Department of Justice from enforcing a national security law that would effectively ban TikTok in the U.S. until Dec. 16.U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent revealed on Monday that a "framework deal" had been reached involving TikTok. Under the national security law, which would have come into effect on Wednesday, app store operators like Apple and Google and internet service providers would be penalized for providing services to TikTok's U.S. operations if a deal was not reached.Under the framework deal, about 80% of TikTok's U.S. business would be owned by an investor consortium that includes Oracle, Silver Lake and Andreessen Horowitz, the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday reported. As part of the arrangement, existing U.S. users would need to shift to a new app, according to report.Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are expected on Friday to discuss the terms of the TikTok-related deal that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent revealed on Monday.The deal, which is expected to close in the next 30 to 45 days, includes new investors, existing ByteDance investors and will result in Oracle maintaining its cloud computing agreement with TikTok, CNBC's David Faber reported earlier on Tuesday. Bessent said Tuesday during CNBC's Squawk Box that Trump was willing to let TikTok "go dark," which spurred China to agree to a deal. The Treasury Secretary said that the deal's commercial terms had already been finalized "in essence" since March or April, but China put the deal on hold following Trump's tough tariffs and trade policies."We were able to reach a series of agreements, mostly for things we will not be doing in the future that have no effect on our national security," Bessent said Tuesday.A senior White House official said in a statement that, "Any details of the TikTok framework are pure speculation unless they are announced by this administration."TikTok did not reply to a request for comment.WATCH: Trump's willingness to let TikTok go dark motivated China to make deal.watch nowVIDEO8:1708:17Treasury Secretary Bessent: Trump's willingness to let TikTok go dark motivated China to make dealSquawk BoxSubscribe to CNBC PROSubscribe to Investing ClubLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSelect Personal FinanceCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelSupply Chain ValuesClosed CaptioningDigital ProductsNews ReleasesInternshipsCorrectionsAbout CNBCAd ChoicesSite MapPodcastsCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?
