I wish we could, but we are putting $600 billion to work in the next four years," he said. "And so it is an extraordinary commitment. And there's 79 factories across the U.S. that will benefit from this."Cook told Cramer Apple's factory buildout might encourage other corporations to build their own factories in these communities, creating a "domino effect." He also said there will be "some surprises" for communities who do not yet know Apple will be bringing business to their areas.Cook emphasized in the interview his company's recent decision to invest $2.5 billion to expand its partnership with Corning and its glass factory in Kentucky. Apple previously has said Corning's facility will provide glass for all iPhones and Apple Watches. Cook told Cramer the Corning investment is a "great start, and a very important one, because the glass is something you interface with all the time."In total, Apple has pledged a staggering $600 billion to boost manufacturing in the U.S. over the next four years. The iPhone maker also previously said it would work with a number of different companies to grow domestic semiconductor production, including Taiwan Semiconductor, Texas Instruments and Applied Materials.Cook also told Cramer that Apple plays a role in helping train employees to work in these factories, mentioning the company's new "Manufacturing Academy" in Detroit. He indicated that Apple aims to help small to medium-sized businesses and share its curriculum with community colleges.According to Cook, Apple shareholders are not protesting the company's colossal domestic manufacturing spend. He said he thinks most feel it's positive that Apple is "investing in America.""I think most of our shareholders believe that we're in the best position to, to make these type of decisions," Cook said. "I haven't gotten a single complaint about the $600 billion."watch nowVIDEO8:3908:39Apple CEO Tim Cook goes one-on-one with Jim CramerMad Money with Jim CramerJim Cramer's Guide to InvestingClick here to download Jim Cramer's Guide to Investing at no cost to help you build long-term wealth and invest smarter.Sign up now for the CNBC Investing Club to follow Jim Cramer's every move in the market.Disclaimer The CNBC Investing Club owns shares of Apple.Questions for Cramer?
