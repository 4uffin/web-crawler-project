Aaron Schwartz | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe Senate on Monday confirmed President Donald Trump's pick to join the Federal Reserve, Stephen Miran, just one day before the central bank meets to consider whether to cut interest rates.Miran's fast-tracked confirmation late Monday night means that he will attend the highly-anticipated meeting in Washington D.C., which begins Tuesday.Miran has said that once confirmed, he plans to take an unpaid leave of absence from his job as chair of the White House's Council of Economic Advisors. But he has so far stopped short of agreeing to resign from the position.Markets are expecting the central bank to announce a rate cut for the first time since December 2024. But questions remain over how deep any cut might be.Fed Chair Jerome Powell has so far resisted the president's pressure campaign. But he signaled last month that economic conditions — including uncertainty caused by tariffs — may warrant rate cuts at the September meeting.Miran is not likely to be a decisive vote on rate cuts this week. At its last meeting in late July, members of the Federal Open Market Committee voted 9-2 to keep rates steady.But critics say Miran could try to influence members of the committee, and they warn that his presence — while also serving as a top White House aide — undermines the central bank's independence from the Trump administration.That prospect has further inflamed concerns among Democrats and some economists that the Fed's independence is under threat if a White House appointee working for the president simultaneously serves as an "independent" governor of the central bank."One day of serving as the President's chief economist and a supposedly independent Governor at the Fed would be one day too many," Senate Banking Committee Ranking Member Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said before Miran made it through her committee on a party-line vote last week.These new concerns are on top of longstanding fears sparked by Trump's bare knuckle pressure campaigns to get the central bank to slash borrowing costs by any means.Trump picked Miran to fill the seat vacated by former Governor Adriana Kugler, who abruptly announced her resignation in August.Miran will serve until Jan. 31, 2026, when Kugler's term was set to expire."The term for which I've been nominated is four and a half months. If I am nominated and confirmed for a longer term than just a handful of months, I would absolutely resign" from the White House, Miran said at his confirmation hearing.Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump DOJ sued by Epstein prosecutor Maurene Comey over 'illegal' firingTrump tariffs are fueling inflation, congressional budget chief saysCharlie Kirk shooting: Utah Gov.

Trump has asked a federal appeals court to pause that lower-court ruling before Tuesday's Fed meeting.Subscribe to CNBC PROSubscribe to Investing ClubLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSelect Personal FinanceCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelSupply Chain ValuesClosed CaptioningDigital ProductsNews ReleasesInternshipsCorrectionsAbout CNBCAd ChoicesSite MapPodcastsCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?
