The project is set to be jointly developed by Holtec, EDF and Tritax.SMRs promise to have smaller and lighter footprints than traditional power plants, potentially making them cheaper and quicker to build when they are fully commercialized.Amazon and Google both signed deals last year to develop SMRs in the U.S., as tech giants increasingly turn to nuclear power to fulfill the growing energy demands of data centers.'A true nuclear renaissance'Some of the other deals expected to be signed as part of the agreement, known as the Atlantic Partnership for Advanced Nuclear Energy, include plans to establish the world's first micro modular nuclear power plant."With President Trump's leadership, the United States is ushering in a true nuclear renaissance – harnessing the power of commercial nuclear to meet rising energy demand and fuel the AI revolution," U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said on Monday.As it is low-carbon, advocates argue that nuclear power has the potential to play a significant role in helping countries generate electricity while slashing emissions and reducing their reliance on fossil fuels.Some environmental groups, however, warn that the nuclear industry is an expensive and harmful distraction from cheaper and cleaner alternatives.Subscribe to CNBC PROSubscribe to Investing ClubLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSelect Personal FinanceCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelSupply Chain ValuesClosed CaptioningDigital ProductsNews ReleasesInternshipsCorrectionsAbout CNBCAd ChoicesSite MapPodcastsCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?
