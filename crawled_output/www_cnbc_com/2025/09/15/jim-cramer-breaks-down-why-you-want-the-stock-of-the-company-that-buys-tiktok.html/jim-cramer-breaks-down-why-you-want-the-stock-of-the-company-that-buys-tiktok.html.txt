"Whoever buys it, you want to buy their stock," Cramer said Monday on "Squawk on the Street," emphasizing the privately owned app's unmatched advertising prowess. "You can take this thing to the limit," Cramer continued. "We don't really know how much it can make. But one thing we do know is that's the best targeted ad in the world. If you're one of these consumer products companies, this is the best way to reach somebody other than to be in maybe Amazon and Google — and maybe better than Amazon and Google . It's huge." Cramer's comments came after U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Monday that the U.S. and China have agreed to a "framework" for a deal to keep TikTok operational in the U.S. The framework was reached during trade talks in Spain over the weekend and is aimed at resolving Washington's longstanding national concerns over the app, which is owned by privately held Chinese tech giant ByteDance. In April 2024, former President Joe Biden signed a law that would ban TikTok from operating in the U.S. unless ByteDance sold it within a year. Since taking office in January, Trump has delayed enforcement of the ban provision on multiple occasions, though the latest deadline is now Wednesday. The deal framework – which still needs final approval from the Chinese government – could lead to a change in TikTok's ownership structure, potentially shifting control to a U.S.-based entity. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are expected to talk Friday to discuss the framework. Still, many details remain unclear. CNBC's David Faber noted that the exact structure of the deal and the identity of any potential buyer — or buyers — are still unknown. Speaking alongside Cramer on "Squawk on the Street," Faber noted that several companies have reportedly shown interest in acquiring TikTok over the years including AppLovin , Amazon and Oracle . Several private investor groups also have expressed interest. For its part, Oracle provides cloud infrastructure for TikTok and became its "trusted technology provider" in 2020 , as part of efforts to keep the app running in the U.S. during the first Trump administration. The U.S. is TikTok's largest market and therefore a key driver of its advertising revenue. With a looming deadline to resolve the company's fate in the U.S., the clock is ticking. One thing is clear, according to Cramer: Whoever owns TikTok will be holding one of the world's most powerful digital advertising tools on the planet.Subscribe to CNBC PROSubscribe to Investing ClubLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSelect Personal FinanceCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelSupply Chain ValuesClosed CaptioningDigital ProductsNews ReleasesInternshipsCorrectionsAbout CNBCAd ChoicesSite MapPodcastsCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?
