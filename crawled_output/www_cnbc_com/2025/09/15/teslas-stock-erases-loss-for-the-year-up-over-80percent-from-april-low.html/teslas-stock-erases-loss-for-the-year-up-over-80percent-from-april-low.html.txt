Since bottoming in April, following President Trump's announced plan for new tariffs, the stock is up 85%. The stock gained on Monday after CEO Elon Musk revealed the purchase of about $1 billion in Tesla shares.

Hamad I Mohammed | ReutersTesla's shares have finally turned positive for the year.After a dismal first quarter, which was the worst for the stock in any period since 2022, and a brutal start to April, following President Donald Trump's announcement of sweeping new tariffs, Wall Street has again rallied around the electric vehicle maker.The stock rose 3.6% on Monday to $410.26, topping its closing price of 2024 by over $6. It's up 85% since bottoming for the year at $221.86 on April 4. A new filing revealed that CEO Elon Musk purchased about $1 billion worth of shares in the company through his family foundation.It's the second straight year Tesla has bounced back after a down first quarter. Last year, the shares fell 29% in the first three months before ending up 63% for 2024.In recent weeks, analysts have praised the EV maker's proposed pay plan for Musk, which could amount to a $1 trillion windfall for the world's richest person over the next decade. The company has also gotten a boost from its new MegaBlocks battery energy storage systems that Tesla ships preassembled to businesses looking to lower their power costs or make greater use of electricity from renewable resources.Even with the rebound, Tesla is the second-worst performer this year among tech's megacaps, ahead of only Apple, which is down about 5% in 2025. Tesla is still in the midst of a multi-quarter sales slump due to an aging lineup of EVs and increased competition from lower-cost competitors in China, namely BYD.Tesla has seen a consumer backlash, in part because of Musk's political activities, including spending nearly $300 million to propel President Trump back to the White House and his work with the Trump administration to slash the federal workforce.Tesla leadership has been working to shift investors' attention to other topics such as robotaxis and humanoid robots.However, the company has yet to deliver vehicles that are safe to use without a human onboard and ready to take control if needed. And while Musk is touting Tesla's Optimus robots, which he says will be able to do everything from factory work to babysitting, a product is still a long way from hitting the market.WATCH: Musk's share purchasewatch nowVIDEO5:0905:09Elon Musk's Tesla stock purchase is a great vote of confidence, says Sand Hill's Brenda VingielloClosing BellSubscribe to CNBC PROSubscribe to Investing ClubLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSelect Personal FinanceCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelSupply Chain ValuesClosed CaptioningDigital ProductsNews ReleasesInternshipsCorrectionsAbout CNBCAd ChoicesSite MapPodcastsCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?
