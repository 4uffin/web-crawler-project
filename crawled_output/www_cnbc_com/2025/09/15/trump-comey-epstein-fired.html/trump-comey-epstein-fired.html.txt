Comey, or because of her perceived political affiliation and beliefs, or both."The lawsuit names the Department of Justice, the Executive Office of the President and their respective leaders as defendants, along with the Office of Personnel Management and the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys.The Justice Department declined CNBC's request for comment on the suit.Comey is the latest among dozens of DOJ employees who have turned to the courts after being terminated during Trump's second term.Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump cannot fire Fed's Lisa Cook before FOMC meeting, appeals court rulesTrump pick Stephen Miran confirmed to Fed Board; will keep White House positionTrump DOJ sued by Epstein prosecutor Maurene Comey over 'illegal' firingTrump tariffs are fueling inflation, congressional budget chief saysCharlie Kirk shooting: Utah Gov.

Instead of fear, let this moment fuel the fire that already burns in the heart of this place," she wrote. "A fire of righteous indignation at abuses of power. Of commitment to seek justice for victims."— CNBC's Jim Forkin contributed to this report.Correction: Maurene Comey's husband is Lucas Issacharoff.
