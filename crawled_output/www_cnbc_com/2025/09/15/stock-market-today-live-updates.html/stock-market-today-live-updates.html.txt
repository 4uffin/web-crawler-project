Details about the deal on the social media platform come after U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Monday that the U.S. and China have reached a "framework" deal for TikTok, just days ahead of a Wednesday deadline to either divest TikTok's U.S. business or shut down the social media app in the country.Investors remain on edge about the so-called reciprocal tariffs set to take effect in November.Bessent said during a CNBC interview on Tuesday that he expects further talks to happen before that deadline, and that "the Chinese now sense that a trade deal is possible" after U.S. and Chinese officials concluded two days of talks on Monday.
