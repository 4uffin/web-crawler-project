The Nasdaq Composite lost 0.07% to finish the session at 22,333.96. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 125.55 points, or 0.27%, to close at 45,757.90.Key bull market leaders declined, with shares of Nvidia and Microsoft losing 1.6% and 1.2%, respectively. Palantir and Google parent Alphabet also pulled back.The two-day Fed meeting, which kicked off on Tuesday, is expected to result in a rate cut for the first time since December. Interest rate futures are pricing in a 100% certainty of at least a quarter-point rate cut, according to the CME's FedWatch tool. What investors are watching most is the central bank's forecast for rates for the rest of the year and whether voting members are expecting one more additional cut or two more before 2025 ends.Traders will also closely monitor Fed Chair Jerome Powell's subsequent press conference for any clues on the future of monetary policy. The meeting also comes with some political tension, after the Senate confirmed President Donald Trump's pick to join the central bank, Stephen Miran. The president is also attempting to remove Fed Governor Lisa Cook, who is voting at the meeting with Miran."Although labor demand is softening, labor supply issues continue to offset the weakness, and recession risks remain limited for now," said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management. "Any decision to cut by 50 basis points at this stage would appear to be driven more by political pressure than economic necessity. A more measured 25 basis point cut remains the appropriate response, allowing the Fed to get ahead of a slowdown without overreacting to early signs of strain." (One basis point equals 0.01%.)Traders continue to monitor developments on global trade discussions and so-called reciprocal tariffs that are set to take effect in November.U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC on Tuesday that he expects further talks before that deadline, and that "the Chinese now sense that a trade deal is possible" after U.S. and Chinese officials wrapped up two days of talks in Madrid on Monday. Trump also gave a positive assessment of the trade discussions on Monday, which led U.S. stocks to rally and pushed the S&P 500 to close above 6,600 for the first time.During their talks this week, U.S. and Chinese officials reached a "framework" agreement on TikTok to allow the social media app to keep operating in the U.S. Sources confirmed to CNBC on Tuesday that Oracle will be among the firms enabling TikTok, which led the stock 1.5% higher on Tuesday.Yet U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said on Monday that broader trade discussions had been "deferred" to another time given the intense focus on reaching a deal regarding TikTok.8 Hours AgoMajor U.S. indexes end Tuesday in the redInvestors took in profits from record gains seen in recent sessions.The S&P 500 dropped 0.13% to close at 6,606.76.

"We continue to see TSMC well placed to benefit from continued AI strength and see littlecompetitive threat materialising any time soon despite developments at Samsung (OW) and Intel," the analysts said in the note.The elevated price target comes as surging interest in artificial-intelligence, or technologies that rely on high-performance computing workloads, fuels demand for specialized semiconductor chips.That "continued AI strength suggests TSMC is seeing no shortage of demand," Barclays analysts said, even as the U.S.' ongoing trade negotiations continue to pose a threat to Taiwan Semiconductors' business. Taiwan Semiconductor is also likely to post strong earnings in its upcoming reports, aided by foreign exchange tailwinds on the margin side, according to Barclays.— Liz Napolitano9 Hours AgoJosh Brown: S&P 500 "should be higher as monetary policy is more accommodative" Josh BrownDanielle DeVries | CNBCRecent stock market euphoria could signal the U.S. is headed for another recession, but investors shouldn't rush to pull their money out of equities, Ritholtz Wealth Management CEO Josh Brown said on CNBC's Halftime Report. "You never have a bull market that doesn't have these little sideshows going on, and historically, those have not been reasons to just abandon your investments," Brown said. U.S. markets are poised to continue their bull run, despite signs the labor marketing is weakening and inflation is accelerating, Brown said, adding that stocks will likely rise following the Federal Reserve's expected rate cut on Wednesday."The S&P 500 should be higher as monetary policy is more accommodative," Brown said.The CEO added that investors should make decisions based on data rather than their "gut feelings," adding that consumer spending in the U.S. has remained strong.— Liz Napolitano9 Hours AgoWith big banks are 'winning,' Citi remains top pick, says Wells FargoWells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo is bullish on the five big banks, with Citi remaining his "Dominant #1 favorite."

Still, the economist said he sees a clear path to a 100 basis point cut given clear signs of disinflation. "I don't think that we would get a hawkish 50, 'cause that doesn't make any damn sense in the context that this is a cumulative 100 basis points or so to go. So that's my expectation tomorrow, is 25, but with a warm and fuzzy tone to what's going to happen at the next two meetings," McCulley said Tuesday on CNBC's "The Exchange.""Quite frankly, I don't know how I would explain [a 50 basis point cut] in the current context without saying the labor market really is worrying me intensely, and I don't think that's the message that Chair Powell wants to communicate — at least not now," he added.— Pia Singh11 Hours AgoWebtoon Entertainment, Steel Dynamics, Hims & Hers among stocks making biggest midday movesThomas Fuller | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesCheck out the companies making the biggest moves Tuesday afternoon:Webtoon Entertainment — Shares rallied 31% after the company reached a deal to create a digital comic platform for Disney.
