Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn., and Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., reintroduced the bill to the Senate for the second time. The bill was previously introduced in the Senate in 2023.A House version of the bill put forward in March, which was sponsored by Reps. Ann Wagner, R-Mo., and Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., was unanimously approved by the House Financial Services Committee on Tuesday.Both versions of the bill would require the Securities and Exchange Commission to report to Congress on ways to prevent financial exploitation of elderly and vulnerable adults through legislation and regulation.The legislation would also allow certain financial institutions to delay transactions that raise suspicions of financial exploitation. Registered open-end investment companies or transfer agents for those companies, including mutual funds, would be able to delay the redemption period for any redeemable security transaction that raises suspicions of financial exploitation.The House version of the bill passed the Financial Services Committee with a 50 to 0 vote. In a statement, Wagner said she looks forward to the whole House taking up the bill.watch nowVIDEO3:5103:51How to stop financial fraud against seniorsOn the MoneySubscribe to CNBC PROSubscribe to Investing ClubLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSelect Personal FinanceCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelSupply Chain ValuesClosed CaptioningDigital ProductsNews ReleasesInternshipsCorrectionsAbout CNBCAd ChoicesSite MapPodcastsCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?
