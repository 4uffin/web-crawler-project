Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesU.S. Treasury yields edged higher Wednesday after the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates for the first time since December.The 10-year Treasury yield rose more than 4.5 basis points to 4.074% after earlier dropping below 4%. The 2-year Treasury yield added nearly 4 basis points to 3.549%. The 30-year Treasury bond yield increased about 2.5 basis points to 4.672%.One basis point is equal to 0.01%, and yields and prices move in opposite directions.The Fed approved a quarter point rate cut at the conclusion of its meeting Wednesday, and signaled two more reductions are on the way before year's end but only one more in 2026. The decision Wednesday puts the overnight funds rate in a range between 4%-4.25%.Newly appointed Trump pick Stephen Miran was the only Fed policymaker voting against the quarter-point move, instead advocating for a half-point cut. That meant fewer dissenting voices than investors had expecting heading into the meeting, which was accompanied by an elevated level of political intensity. Governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller, potential dissenting votes after objecting at the July meeting, supported the quarter-point cut.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconU.S. 10-year yield intradayTraders may have initially reacted to the Fed noting recent sluggishness in the labor market in its statement, possibly signaling it was moving its focus to that part of the central bank's dual mandate instead of fighting inflation. "Job gains have slowed, and the unemployment rate has edged up but remains low," the central bank said in its statement Wednesday.At the same, the Fed pointed to a more hawkish outlook for rates in 2026, where members are predicting only one more quarter point reduction. But the Fed's so-called dot plot, a summary of economic projections by all members, those with votes and those without, shows a large variance of opinion for the next year.Fed Chair Jerome Powell also characterized the move as a "risk management cut," suggesting the reduction was more of an insurance move in case the economy slowed significantly.It all added up to a volatile session where bond traders were divided on where market rates are headed next.Subscribe to CNBC PROSubscribe to Investing ClubLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSelect Personal FinanceCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelSupply Chain ValuesClosed CaptioningDigital ProductsNews ReleasesInternshipsCorrectionsAbout CNBCAd ChoicesSite MapPodcastsCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?
