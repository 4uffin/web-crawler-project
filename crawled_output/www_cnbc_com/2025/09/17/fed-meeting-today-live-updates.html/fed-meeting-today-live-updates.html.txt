At the moment, the so-called dot-plot predicts one more quarter-point cut next year. However, some members of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee see a path to three rate reductions in the coming year.During a news conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday's decision reflects a desire to keep risks to the economy in check."You can think of this, in a way, as a risk management cut," Powell said. He added that a "very different picture" of risks has emerged as the labor market has begun to cool off versus the threats on the inflation front.The central bank had been holding firm on interest rates as inflation has remained above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. Powell has expressed concern that tariffs put in place by the Trump administration could led prices to surge.The Fed chair said companies have been slow to pass costs from the levies on to consumers, but he expects the impact will build "over the course of the rest of the year and into next year.Wed, Sep 17 20253:29 PM EDTInflation for goods prices 'to continue to build' over rest of this year and 2026, Powell saysU.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell speaks during a press conference following the issuance of the Federal Open Market Committee's statement on interest rate policy, in Washington, D.C., U.S., Sept. 17, 2025. Elizabeth Frantz | ReutersFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned on Wednesday that he expects the effects of inflation on goods prices "to continue to build" through the rest of this year and into 2026, shortly after the monetary policymaker cut interest rates by a quarter percentage point. "We have begun to see goods prices showing through into higher inflation, and actually the increase in goods prices accounts for most of the increase in inflation, or perhaps all of the increase in inflation over the course of this year," Powell said in a press conference.He added, "those are not very large effects at this point, and we do expect them to continue to build over the course of the rest of the year and into next year."CPI rose 2.9% on an annual basis last month, marking the largest gain since January. Since April, inflation has mostly accelerated on a month-to-month basis. Wed, Sep 17 20253:23 PM EDT'Nothing new' to say on if Powell will leave after his term ends Asked whether he will leave as chair of the central bank after his term ends in May 2026, Powell said there's "nothing new" to say on this topic.The Trump administration is considering 11 candidates to replace Powell, including Jefferies Chief Market Strategist David Zervos, former Fed Governor Larry Lindsey and BlackRock's chief investment officer for global fixed income at BlackRock Rick Rieder. Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman and Fed Governor Chris Waller are also under consideration.— Yun LiWed, Sep 17 20253:17 PM EDTPowell says consumers have felt small impact from tariffs so far as companies eat cost increasesWomen's shoes for sale in Annapolis, MD, on September 11, 2025. Jim Watson | AFP | Getty ImagesFed Chair Jerome Powell said President Donald Trump's tariffs have mainly appeared to be covered by importing companies, meaning consumers haven't seen major price increases tied to the levies yet."To the consumer, the passthrough has been pretty small," Powell said. "It's been ... slower and smaller than we thought."To be sure, Powell noted that companies have said they eventually plan to pass more of the cost increases onto shoppers, which can result in higher price tags.— Alex HarringWed, Sep 17 20253:13 PM EDTPowell says job market doesn't need to soften furtherFed Chair Jerome Powell said he doesn't prefer that the labor market loosen any further."The labor market is softening and we don't need it to soften anymore (and) don't want it to," Powell said.Powell cited rising unemployment among minorities as one reason for concern.— Alex HarringWed, Sep 17 20252:57 PM EDTPowell says no 'widespread support' for larger rate cutJerome Powell, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, during a news conference following a Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in Washington, DC, US, on Wednesday, Sept. 17, 2025. Kent Nishimura | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesDespite President Donald Trump's demand for more aggressive action from the Federal Reserve, Chair Jerome Powell said there was little support for large rate cuts at this week's meeting."There wasn't widespread support at all for a 50 basis point," Powell said at his post-meeting news conference. "I think we've done very large rate hikes and very large rate cuts in the last five years, and we tend to do those at a time when you feel that policy is out of place and needs to move quickly to a new place. That's not at all what I feel certainly now, I feel like our policy has been doing the right thing so far this year."The Fed instead opted for a quarter-percentage point reduction.—Jeff CoxWed, Sep 17 20252:52 PM EDTPowell: View this as a 'risk management cut'Fed Chair Jerome Powell described Wednesday's interest rate decrease as a way to keep risk in check."You can think of this, in a way, as a risk management cut," Powell said.Powell added that there's a "very different picture" of risks tied to the labor market and that it is "really cooling off."— Alex HarringWed, Sep 17 20252:50 PM EDTOne cut projected for 2026, but many differing opinions among FOMC membersOne surprise out of the Federal Reserve's meeting was that only one rate cut is projected in 2026. But opinions on this path are varied with two voting members seeing as many as four cuts. A single quarter-point reduction next year is significantly more conservative than current market pricing. Traders are currently pricing in at two to three more rate cuts next year, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool, updated shortly after the decision.Click here to read more from Yun Li about the closely watched "dot plot." —Christina Cheddar Berk, Yun LiWed, Sep 17 20252:43 PM EDTData shows softening labor market, rising inflationU.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell speaks during a press conference following the issuance of the Federal Open Market Committee's statement on interest rate policy, in Washington, D.C., U.S., Sept. 17, 2025. Elizabeth Frantz | ReutersRecent data has suggested a softening in the labor market, while inflation has risen, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said."While the unemployment rate remains low, it has edged up, job gains have slowed, and downside risks to employment have risen at the same time, inflation has risen recently and remains somewhat elevated," he said in the post-meeting news conference.— Michelle FoxWed, Sep 17 20252:35 PM EDTThe doves are now in the driver's seat, says Goldman's Simon DangoorThe majority of the Federal Reserve now targeting two further rate cuts this year indicates that the doves on the committee are now in the driver's seat, said Simon Dangoor, head of fixed income macro strategies at Goldman Sachs Asset Management."We think it would take a significant upside surprise in inflation or labor market rebound to take the Fed off its current easing trajectory," he said.— Michelle FoxWed, Sep 17 20252:29 PM EDTJust one dissent is positive for Fed independence, says JPMorgan's KellyIt is really important that there was just one dissent in the Federal Reserve's rate-cut decision, said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management.While Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman may each want the job of Federal Reserve chair, they weren't willing to go against the consensus, he said in an interview with CNBC."To me, the fact that they are not going to fall over themselves to say 50 basis points now, even if they want more Fed easing, I think that is a very positive sign because it says the Federal Reserve as an institution regards its independence as tremendously important and they are not going to fall over themselves to do what the administration wants right now," Kelly said.— Michelle FoxWed, Sep 17 20252:20 PM EDTHere’s what the Fed rate cut means for your mortgage rate, credit cards, savings accounts and moreAn aerial view of homes in a neighborhood on Aug.27, 2025 in San Francisco, California.Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesThe Fed's rate cut will have a trickle-down effect on many types of consumer loans and savings rates.The federal funds rate, which is set by the Federal Open Market Committee, is the interest rate at which banks borrow and lend to one another overnight. Although that's not the rate consumers pay, the Fed's move will pave the way for relief from some of the high borrowing costs that have weighed on consumers.Credit cards, for example, have a variable rate, so there's a direct connection to the Fed's benchmark. Mortgage rates, on the other hand, are more influenced by Treasury yields and the economy so there's less of an immediate impact.Here's the breakdown of all of the ways the Fed's decision to lower its benchmark could affect your finances in the months ahead.— Jessica DicklerWed, Sep 17 20252:13 PM EDTSee what changed in the new Fed statementIn its statement, the Fed acknowledged slight increases in the unemployment rate and a "shift" in the balance of risks.

At the July meeting Governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller had wanted to trim rates by 25 basis points, but the pair appeared satisfied by the reduction the policymakers approved at the September meeting.All three governors were appointed by President Donald Trump, who has been actively pushing for the central bank to bring down interest rates as quickly as possible.—Christina Cheddar BerkWed, Sep 17 20252:02 PM EDTFederal Reserve backs quarter-point cut in key interest rate in SeptemberCentral bank policymakers voted to cut the key interest rate by 0.25%, or 25 basis points, putting the benchmark rate in the range of 4.00% to 4.25%. Read more here on the Fed's rate decision from CNBC's Jeff Cox.—Christina Cheddar Berk Wed, Sep 17 20251:53 PM EDTWith Fed likely to cut, the big questions are: How deep a move? How divided a decision?U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell leaves after a press conference following the issuance of the Federal Open Market Committee's statement on interest rate policy in Washington, D.C., U.S., July 30, 2025. Jonathan Ernst | ReutersWith signs of the labor market weakening, the Federal Reserve is widely expected to reduce its benchmark interest rate by a quarter-point, or 25 basis points. However, there are some who want the central bank to go further faster.The critical questions investors will want to answer are: How far will interest rates fall this year and how divided is the central bank?The July meeting was notable for its two dissenters, Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman. This time around the tension could be heightened even further. President Donald Trump has appointed Stephen Miran to the group. Miran, who replaced Adriana Kugler, has been a Fed critic and he is expected to push for deep cuts.If the majority opts to ease rates by 25 basis points, it is possible Waller and Bowman will once again dissent. This time, joined by Miran.In addition, there also could be pressure to keep the benchmark rate steady between 4.25% and 4.50%. That could put two other Federal Open Market Committee members in the opposition. Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid and St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem are seen by some as wanting to keep rates where they are.— Christina Cheddar BerkWed, Sep 17 20251:51 PM EDTWhere the markets stand prior to the Fed's decisionThe three major averages were mixed around 1:50 p.m. ET as the Federal Reserve's rate decision loomed.The S&P 500 was last down 0.1%, while the Nasdaq Composite shed 0.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, however, was toting a 210-point gain, or up about 0.5%.The 10-year Treasury yield traded at 4.045%, up nearly 2 basis points. The rate on the 2-year Treasury was last up 3 basis points at 3.541%.—Christina Cheddar Berk Wed, Sep 17 20251:32 PM EDTWhere consumer rates stand since March 2022A woman carries shopping bags in Manhattan in New York City, U.S., August 11, 2025. Eduardo Munoz | ReutersSavers and investors who look for attractive yields on fixed income assets have faired pretty well since the Federal Reserve started raising rates in March 2022.As of the week ended Sept. 12, the annual percentage yield on a five-year certificate of deposit sat at 1.7%, up from 0.5% in March 2022, according to Haver. Yields on savings accounts are also currently higher: 0.4% as of Sept. 12, versus the 0.06% paid in March 2022, per the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC.Rates haven't been so great for borrowers, however, even as the Fed cut by a full point in 2024. The average rate on a 30-year mortgage stood at 6.29% last week, compared with 4.29% in March 2022, according to Mortgage News Daily. Credit card annual percentage rates also remain high, standing at 20.12% as of a week ago, versus 16.34% in March 2022, according to Bankrate.—Christina Cheddar Berk, Nick WellsWed, Sep 17 20251:25 PM EDTIf the Fed cuts rates, will the market come to regret it? With the market so sure that a rate cut is coming, some have suggested Wednesday's news could put pressure on stocks. "As we look toward month-end, Fed Day may act as a 'sell-the-news' event as investors take time to consider the Fed future reaction function, potentially stretched positioning, a temporarily weaker corporate buyback bid, waning Retail investor participation, and quarter-end rebalancing," JPMorgan's trading desk wrote. Others fear the interest rate cut will itself do more harm than good, with longtime market watcher Ed Yardeni saying it's "throwing gasoline on a fire."He's in the camp that believes the economy is still on solid footing even as inflation has remained above the central bank's 2% target and job growth has slowed. —Christina Cheddar Berk, Fred ImbertSubscribe to CNBC PROSubscribe to Investing ClubLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSelect Personal FinanceCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelSupply Chain ValuesClosed CaptioningDigital ProductsNews ReleasesInternshipsCorrectionsAbout CNBCAd ChoicesSite MapPodcastsCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?
