The company also hires temporary workers and independent contractors seasonally, particularly around the crucial holiday season.Last year, Amazon workers at seven U.S. facilities had walked off the job during the holiday shopping rush, after union officials said the retailer had failed to come to the bargaining table to negotiate contracts. Employees were protesting what they said was Amazon's unfair treatment of its workers.In December, Amazon also agreed to implement safety measures at all of its U.S. facilities to settle a federal agency's claims that it failed to prevent workers from developing back problems and other ergonomic injuries.Subscribe to CNBC PROSubscribe to Investing ClubLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSelect Personal FinanceCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelSupply Chain ValuesClosed CaptioningDigital ProductsNews ReleasesInternshipsCorrectionsAbout CNBCAd ChoicesSite MapPodcastsCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?
