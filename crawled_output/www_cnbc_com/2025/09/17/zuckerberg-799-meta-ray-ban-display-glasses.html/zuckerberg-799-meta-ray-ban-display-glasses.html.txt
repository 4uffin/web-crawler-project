A promotional video of the new smart glasses appeared on Meta's YouTube page on Monday but was later removed.Tune in Thursday at 11:00 a.m. ET: Meta Chief Product Officer Chris Cox joins CNBC TV to discuss with Julia Boorstin the highlights of Meta's annual Connect event, live from the company's HQ in Menlo Park CA.The new smart glasses are a bridge between the company's audio-only Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses and the experimental Orion augmented reality glasses that the company revealed at last year's Connect event. Orion can overlay 3D visuals over a person's real-world field of view with the help of a wireless computing puck, but the glasses are expensive to make and not yet available to consumers.The Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses come with the Meta Neural Band, an EMG wristband that allows users to control the device using hand gestures."These are glasses with the classic style that you'd expect from Ray-Ban, but they're the first AI glasses with a high resolution display and a fully weighted Meta neural band," Zuckerberg said.With the new glasses, people can do tasks like watch videos through the display or see and respond to text messages, Zuckerberg said. The display doesn't block a person's view, and it disappears when not being used, he said.The glasses go on sale in the U.S. on Sept. 30.During a demo, Zuckerberg repeatedly attempted to call Meta tech chief Andrew Bosworth unsuccessfully."This is uh — you know, it happens," Zuckerberg said.Meta has been developing its smart glasses with eyewear giant EssilorLuxottica since 2019, and last year renewed a long-term partnership agreement to continue making the products.The company on Wednesday also debuted the Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses, intended for athletes who participate in high-intensity sports like snowboarding and mountain biking. The Oakley-branded glasses will cost $499 when they launch on Oct. 21, making it $100 more expensive than the Oakley Meta HSTN glasses that went on sale in June.The Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses have a sportier look than the Oakley Meta HSTN glasses thanks to a wraparound design that extends its colorful lenses around a person's temples. Unlike the Oakley Meta HSTN glasses, the new model contains a button on the underside of its frames so that athletes who wear helmets can more easily capture photos and videos.The new sports-centric smart glasses have up to nine hours of battery life, can capture 3K video and contain speakers that are louder than their predecessors. The glasses can connect with Garmin-branded fitness watches to track certain stats like their heart rates using the Meta AI assistant. Preorders start today.Meta also debuted the Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2), the latest version of the company's original smart glasses. The Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) costs $379, up from $299 for the version released in 2023. The Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) has double the battery life of the previous model, lasting 8 hours on a single charge, and a more powerful camera that can capture 3K Ultra HD video. The new glasses go on sale today.Zuckerberg also announced Horizon TV, pitching it as a way to watch television shows, sporting events and movies using the company's Quest VR headsets. Some of Meta's partners who will be contributing content to the app include Disney and Universal Pictures, Zuckerberg said.WATCH: Tech management in the AI era.
