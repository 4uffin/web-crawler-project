Meta We expect to learn more about the company's glasses tonight at the Meta Connect Summit and will have full analysis starting at 5 a.m. ET on "Worldwide Exchange" with CNBC's Frank Holland. Meta shares are up 5% in September. The stock is 2.6% from the high hit a month ago. Meta is up 32% year to date. Walmart We'll be watching in the morning after the retail giant hit a new all-time high. The stock fell 1.7% after hitting that new record, to close up 0.8% at $104.27. Walmart is up 7.5% so far in September and up 15% year to date. Target , in comparison, is down 7.3% in September and down 34% year to date. WMT 3M mountain Walmart stock over the past three months. Gold's high The commodity is up 40% year to date. The VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX) has doubled during the same period. It is now up 102% in 2025. So far this month, the GDX is up 8.7%. Darden Restaurants The restaurant company reports before the bell Thursday during "Squawk Box." Darden is down 7% since last reporting three months ago. The stock is 8.5% from its June high. Darden's brands include Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse, Ruth's Chris, The Capital Grille and Seasons 52. Lennar The homebuilder reports Thursday afternoon. Lennar shares are up 27% since it last reported. Shares are 28% from last September's high. LEN 3M mountain Lennar share performance over the past three months. Israel's stock market The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange is down 4% over the past few days after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the country is "in a sort of isolation." He also said, "We will increasingly need to adapt to an economy with autarkic characteristics," which means economic self-reliance. The prime minister has always been a proponent of free markets and is widely credited with privatizing many former Israeli government-run entities over the past 25 years. He later walked some of the comments back, but the damage was done. The iShares MSCI Israel ETF (EIS) fell 3% in three days and is 4.35% from last week's all-time high.Subscribe to CNBC PROSubscribe to Investing ClubLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSelect Personal FinanceCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelSupply Chain ValuesClosed CaptioningDigital ProductsNews ReleasesInternshipsCorrectionsAbout CNBCAd ChoicesSite MapPodcastsCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?
