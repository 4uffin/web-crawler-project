The demographic breakdown of ChatGPT users was also found to have shifted, with the chatbot slowly becoming more universal across gender and national borders. Illustration of the ChatGPT App on the iOS App Store displayed on a phone screen.

For example, writing activities were found to be the most common use case at work, accounting for 40% of work-related messages on average in June.Meanwhile, rather than just using ChatGPT to write things from scratch, about two-thirds of all writing messages asked the chatbot to perform editing, critiquing and translating for existing text. The study also looked at ChatGPT usage patterns in the context of "Asking, Doing, and Expressing."As of July, about half of all messages fell into the "Asking" category, which researchers said suggests that people value ChatGPT most as an advisor rather than only for task completion. However, for work-related messages, about 56% were classified as "Doing," which means the chatbot was used to perform certain job tasks, such as writing."Writing is a task that is common to nearly all white-collar jobs, and good written communication skills are among the top 'soft' skills demanded by employers," the paper noted.The impact that AI models will have on the workplace has been a hot topic since ChatGPT was launched for consumers in November 2022, with growing fears that the technology will be used to replace workers.However, researchers argued their findings showed that, at least in the case of consumer ChatGPT, it was mostly used to help improve judgment and productivity of workers, rather than replace all their tasks, especially in knowledge-intensive jobs. Who's using it? The study noted that as of July, ChatGPT's user base had grown to 10% of the world's adult population.Meanwhile, the demographic breakdown of these ChatGPT users had shifted, with the chatbot slowly becoming more universal across genders and national borders.For example, data from January 2024 showed that 37% of users had typically feminine names, among users with names that could be read as either masculine or feminine.But as of mid-2025, that gender gap was found to have narrowed dramatically, with female adoption consistent with the general adult demographics. ChatGPT has also become more accessible globally, with especially rapid growth in low- and middle-income countries. This has resulted in ChatGPT adoption growth rates in the lowest-income countries growing to over 4 times that in the highest-income countries as of May 2025. Besides offering different paid tiers on its consumer platform, ChatGPT also offers an enterprise product for businesses, API access and a software engineering agent called Codex.While ChatGPT has experienced explosive growth in recent years, it's encountering increasing competition from rivals like Elon Musk's XAI and Google's Gemini.Just this week, Gemini took the top spot among free apps on Apple's App Store, leapfrogging ChatGPT, following the August launch of its "Nano Banana" image editor model.Subscribe to CNBC PROSubscribe to Investing ClubLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSelect Personal FinanceCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelSupply Chain ValuesClosed CaptioningDigital ProductsNews ReleasesInternshipsCorrectionsAbout CNBCAd ChoicesSite MapPodcastsCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?
