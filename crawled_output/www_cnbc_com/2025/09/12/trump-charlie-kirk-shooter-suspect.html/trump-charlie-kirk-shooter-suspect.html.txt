CATCH!"While the governor said he would leave it to others to interpret what the engravings mean, he said that one "speaks for itself."That casing also showed a series of directional arrows, which could be a reference to the button input pattern that triggers a large bomb strike in the video game Helldivers 2.Another casing's inscription referenced a meme that parodies online subcultures.A combination photo shows a person of interest in the fatal shooting of U.S. right-wing activist and commentator Charlie Kirk during an event at Utah Valley University, in Orem, Utah, U.S., in security footage released by the Utah Department of Public Safety on September 11, 2025. Utah Department Of Public Safety | Via Reuters"This is a very sad day" for the country, "but I'm grateful that at this moment, we have an opportunity to bring closure to this very dark chapter in our nation's history," Cox said.Kirk, 31, was the founder of conservative group Turning Point USA, which focuses its political activism on high schools and colleges. He was at UVU in Orem for the first stop on Turning Point's "American Comeback Tour," according to the group's website.Kirk was in the middle of answering an audience member's question, which was about mass shootings, when a gunman shot him once in the neck, sending thousands of people running and screaming for safety.While the manhunt was ongoing, the FBI on Thursday released two grainy photos of a "person of interest" and video footage showing someone jumping off the rooftop from where Kirk was shot.The FBI offered a $100,000 reward for information leading to the killer's arrest.This is breaking news.
