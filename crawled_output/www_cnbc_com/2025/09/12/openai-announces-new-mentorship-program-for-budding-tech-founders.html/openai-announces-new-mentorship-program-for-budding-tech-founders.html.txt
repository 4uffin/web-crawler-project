Applicants will have until Sept. 24 to submit an entry form.CNBC has reached out to OpenAI for comment on the program.Following the program, Grove participants will be able to continue working internally with the ChatGPT maker, which was recent valued $500 billion.Other industry rivals have also already launched their own AI accelerator programs, including the Google for Startups Cloud AI Accelerator last winter. Earlier this April, Microsoft for Startups partnered with PearlX, a cohort accelerator program for pre-seed companies.Nurturing these budding AI companies is just a small chip in the recent massive investments into AI firms, which ate up an impressive 71% of U.S. venture funding in 2025, up from 45% last year, according to an analysis from J.P. Morgan.AI startups raised $104.3 billion in the U.S. in the first half of this year, and currently over 1,300 AI startups have valuations of over $100 million, according to CB Insights.Subscribe to CNBC PROSubscribe to Investing ClubLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSelect Personal FinanceCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelSupply Chain ValuesClosed CaptioningDigital ProductsNews ReleasesInternshipsCorrectionsAbout CNBCAd ChoicesSite MapPodcastsCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?
