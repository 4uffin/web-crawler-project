The year before, holiday sales grew by 4.2%.However, this year's holiday sales will get an extra boost from e-commerce, which is projected to grow between 7% and 9% year-over-year during the 2025-26 holiday season, Deloitte's survey also found."We expect this holiday season to demonstrate the resiliency of consumers as they continue to face economic uncertainty," Natalie Martini, Deloitte's vice chair and U.S. retail and consumer products leader, said in a statement.Fears of higher prices over the holidaysYet, heading into the holiday shopping season, 41% of consumers are concerned that gifts will be more expensive this year and 30% said they expect to spend less this holiday than they did last year, according to a separate report by Bankrate.On average, consumers plan to spend about $1,552 on holiday gifts, travel and entertainment — a 5% drop from the planned holiday spending average in the year-ago period, according to another survey by consulting firm PwC.Nearly half of shoppers, or 49%, have already begun or plan to begin shopping before Oct. 31, according to Bankrate's survey, which polled more than 2,500 adults in July.But for those who aren't in the holiday spirit just yet, prices near the peak season may not be as high as previously thought."Retailers will have to offer discounts to get deal-conscious consumers to spend, and we should see the best deals roll out starting in early October and continue through Christmas," said Ted Rossman, Bankrate's senior industry analyst.The impact of tariffs on holiday gifts"The impact of tariffs for the upcoming holiday season is already baked in because for the most part, retailers have already acquired the items they are going to be putting on the shelves for the holiday season or they are already in transit," said Marbue Brown, a consumer trends analyst and author of "Blueprint for Customer Obsession." watch nowVIDEO6:1606:16Trade deals ahead of holiday orders creates certainty for retailers, says BofA's HutchinsonFast MoneyAccording to Deloitte's McCarthy, many retail buyers placed their holiday orders earlier than usual this year, which can make it harder to manage inventory but helps guard against price shocks.Tariff delays also "allowed a lot of retailers to get holiday merchandise in early at pre-tariff pricing," Rossman said. As a result, "the holiday season could largely be insulated from tariff price hikes."At my local Costco in New Jersey, an artificial 7.5-foot, pre-lit Christmas tree is currently priced at $459.99, in line with last year. At least for now, "retailers are absorbing more of the hit than expected, although this might not last forever," Rossman said.Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.Subscribe to CNBC PROSubscribe to Investing ClubLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSelect Personal FinanceCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelSupply Chain ValuesClosed CaptioningDigital ProductsNews ReleasesInternshipsCorrectionsAbout CNBCAd ChoicesSite MapPodcastsCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?
