The vote was 142-10 with 12 abstentions.Hours before the vote, Netanyahu said "there will be no Palestinian state." Former German Foreign Minister and President of the 80th session of the United Nations General Assembly Annalena Baerbock speaks during a General Assembly meeting to vote on two states solution to the Palestinian question at United Nations headquarters (UN) on September 12, 2025 in New York City. The UN General Assembly on Friday adopted the "New York Declaration" which aims to breathe new life into the two-state solution between Israel and Palestine, without the involvement of Hamas. Angela Weiss | Afp | Getty ImagesThe U.N. General Assembly voted overwhelmingly Friday to support a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict and urge Israel to commit to a Palestinian state, which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vehemently opposes.The 193-member world body approved a nonbinding resolution endorsing the "New York Declaration," which sets out a phased plan to end the nearly 80-year conflict. The vote was 142-10 with 12 abstentions.Hours before the vote, Netanyahu said "there will be no Palestinian state." He spoke at the signing of an agreement to expand settlements that will divide the West Bank, which the Palestinians insist must be part of their state, saying, "This place belongs to us."The resolution was sponsored by France and Saudi Arabia, who co-chaired a high-level conference on implementing a two-state solution in late July, where the declaration was approved.The nearly two-year war in Gaza and the broader Israeli-Palestinian conflict are expected to be at the top of the agenda of world leaders at their annual gathering at the General Assembly starting on Sept. 22. The Palestinians say they hope at least 10 more countries will recognize the state of Palestine, adding to the more than 145 countries that already do.Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian U.N. ambassador, said the support for the resolution reflects "the yearning of almost everyone, the international community, to open the door for the option of peace."Without naming Israel, he said, "We invite a party that is still pushing the option of war and destruction, and attempts to eliminate the Palestinian people and steal their land, to listen to the sound of reason — to the sound of the logic of dealing with this issue peacefully, and for the overwhelming message that has resonated in this General Assembly today."But Israel's U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon dismissed the resolution as "theater," saying the only beneficiary is Hamas."This one-sided declaration will not be remembered as a step toward peace, only as another hollow gesture that weakens this assembly's credibility," he said.The United States, Israel's closest ally, reiterated its opposition to the New York Declaration and the General Assembly resolution endorsing implementation of the two-state solution.The resolution "is yet another misguided and ill-timed publicity stunt that undermines serious diplomatic efforts to end the conflict," U.S. Mission counselor Morgan Ortagus said. "Make no mistake, this resolution is a gift to Hamas."The declaration condemns "the attacks committed by Hamas against civilians" in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, a rare condemnation by Arab nations of Hamas. The Hamas-led militants killed about 1,200 people, mainly Israeli civilians, and took about 250 hostage. Of those, 48 are still being held, including about 20 who are believed to be alive.It also condemns Israel's attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure in Gaza and its "siege and starvation, which have produced a devastating humanitarian catastrophe and protection crisis." Israel's offensive against Hamas has killed over 64,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which doesn't distinguish between civilians and combatants.The declaration envisions the Palestinian Authority governing and controlling all Palestinian territory, with a transitional administrative committee immediately established under its umbrella after a ceasefire in Gaza."In the context of ending the war in Gaza, Hamas must end its rule in Gaza and hand over its weapons to the Palestinian Authority," the declaration says.It also supports deployment of "a temporary international stabilization mission" operating under U.N. auspices to protect Palestinian civilians, support the transfer of security to the Palestinian Authority and provide security guarantees for Palestine and Israel — "including monitoring of the ceasefire and of a future peace agreement."The declaration urges countries to recognize the state of Palestine, calling this "an essential and indispensable component of the achievement of the two-state solution." Without naming Israel but clearly referring to it, the document says "illegal unilateral actions are posing an existential threat to the realization of the independent state of Palestine."Subscribe to CNBC PROSubscribe to Investing ClubLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSelect Personal FinanceCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelSupply Chain ValuesClosed CaptioningDigital ProductsNews ReleasesInternshipsCorrectionsAbout CNBCAd ChoicesSite MapPodcastsCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?
