The 30-year Treasury bond yield rose by more than 5 basis points to 4.726%.One basis point equals 0.01%, and yields move inversely to prices.The Labor Department reported Thursday that initial filings for unemployment insurance totaled a seasonally adjusted 231,000 for the week ending Sept. 13, down 33,000 from the previous week's upwardly revised level and below the Dow Jones consensus estimate for 240,000.Lower jobless claims released Thursday come after a brief spike in the prior week raised concerns that layoffs could be coming, particularly as investors continue to monitor signs of any potential economic slowdown and for cracks in the labor market. This week's tame reading shows that last week's higher claims number was largely due to an aberration from claims out of Texas and not part of a larger issue.Yields were jumping Thursday even as the Federal Reserve on Wednesday agreed to lower its benchmark overnight lending rate by a quarter percentage point to a range between 4.00%-4.25%.Rates initial move immediately following the Fed decision was lower, but then they rebounded before Wednesday's session was over.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconU.S. 10-year Treasury yield, 5 daysFollowing the decision, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said during a press conference that this rate move was a matter of "risk management," dampening hopes for a lengthy rate cut trajectory from the central bank. Policymakers are expecting to agree to two more trims this year, and just one more in 2026."The Fed's 25 basis point cut is a clear signal: the softening labor market and stubborn inflation have pushed policymakers to act — but gradually. This isn't a pivot, it's a measured step," said Gina Bolvin, president at Bolvin Wealth Management Group.Subscribe to CNBC PROSubscribe to Investing ClubLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSelect Personal FinanceCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelSupply Chain ValuesClosed CaptioningDigital ProductsNews ReleasesInternshipsCorrectionsAbout CNBCAd ChoicesSite MapPodcastsCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?
