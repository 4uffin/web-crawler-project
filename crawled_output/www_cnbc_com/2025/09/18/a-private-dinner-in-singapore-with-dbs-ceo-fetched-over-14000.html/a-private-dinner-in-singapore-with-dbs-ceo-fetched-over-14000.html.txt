A Singaporean man also paid more than $2 million to have lunch with Buffett in 2014.This auctioned experience with Tan was part of National Gallery Singapore's 10th anniversary gala. More than SG$2.8 million was raised through the fundraising event held on Saturday, Sept. 13.The funds raised from the event will be used to "advance the Gallery's mission of making art accessible to all – from enabling new exhibitions, deepening curatorial research, and expanding programmes that engage children, seniors, and underserved communities," according to a statement from the museum.The auction, managed by Sotheby's, took place at the gala and featured close to 90 "rare artworks and luxury experiences," including an artwork by Chinese contemporary ink artist Li Huayi, which sold for SG$517,000, a record for an auctioned item at the Gallery.Subscribe to CNBC PROSubscribe to Investing ClubLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSelect Personal FinanceCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelSupply Chain ValuesClosed CaptioningDigital ProductsNews ReleasesInternshipsCorrectionsAbout CNBCAd ChoicesSite MapPodcastsCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?
