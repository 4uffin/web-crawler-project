"Customers will choose the best technology stack for running the world's most popular commercial applications and open-source models."The U.S. has sought to cut China off from the most advanced semiconductors for training AI models. To cope, Chinese companies have turned more to grouping large numbers of less efficient, often homegrown, chips together to achieve similar computing capabilities.Huawei announced it would roll out three new versions of its Ascend chips through the end of 2028, with the aim to "double compute" capabilities with each year's release.The chips form the basis of Huawei's AI computing infrastructure, in which a supercluster is connected to multiple superpods, which, in turn, are built from multiple supernodes. Supernodes, which form the base, are built on Ascend chips, using system design to overcome technical limitations imposed by U.S. sanctions.Huawei said its new Atlas 950 supernode would support 8,192 Ascend chips, and that the Atlas 950 SuperCluster would use more than 500,000 chips.A more advanced Atlas 960 version, slated for launch in 2027, would support 15,488 Ascend chips per node. The full supercluster would have more than 1 million Ascend chips, according to Huawei.It was not immediately clear how the systems compared with those powered by Nvidia chips. Huawei claimed in a press release that the new supernodes would be the world's most powerful by computing power for several years.In a speech Thursday, Eric Xu, vice chairman and rotating chairman of Huawei, claimed that its forthcoming Atlas 950 supernode would deliver 6.7 times more computing power than Nvidia's NVL144 system, also planned for launch next year.Xu even predicted that Huawei's product would "be ahead on all fronts" compared with another Nvidia system planned for launch in 2027 — and claimed the Atlas 950 supercluster would have 1.3 times the computing power of Elon Musk's xAI Colossus supercomputer."Huawei's announcement on its computing breakthrough is well timed with recent increasing emphasis by the Chinese government on self-reliance on China's own chip technologies," said George Chen, partner and co-chair, digital practice, The Asia Group.While he cautioned that Huawei might exaggerate its technical capabilities, Chen pointed out that the Chinese company's ambition to be a world AI leader "cannot be underestimated."watch nowVIDEO27:0227:02Watch CNBC's full interview with Treasury Secretary Scott BessentSquawk BoxResearch firm SemiAnalysis found in April that Huawei's self-developed CloudMatrix system was able to perform better than Nvidia's — despite each Ascend chip delivering only about one-third the performance of an Nvidia processor. Huawei built its advantage by having five times as many chips."Computing power has and will continue to be the key for AI," Rotating Chairman Xu said Thursday in a statement, translated by CNBC. He was speaking at the opening of the company's annual Huawei Connect event in Shanghai. The event runs through Saturday.Two years ago at the same event, Huawei announced its Atlas 900 SuperCluster. The company currently sells a "Atlas 900 AI Cluster" with "thousands" of Ascend chips.Huawei said Thursday it had deployed more than 300 of its Atlas 900 A3 supernodes to more than 20 customers in telecoms, manufacturing and other industries.Rising pressure on NvidiaHuawei's announcement comes as China promotes homegrown alternatives to Nvidia. Earlier this week, the two countries wrapped up trade talks in Spain that included a path toward resolving the long-contested U.S. operations of social media app TikTok, owned by Beijing-based startup ByteDance.In another aggressive signal, China on Monday announced it was extending a probe into Nvidia over alleged monopolistic practices.Pressure has only risen since on the U.S. chipmaker. Its shares fell more than 2% Wednesday after the Financial Times, citing sources, said China has ordered local tech giants to stop tests and orders of the Nvidia RTX Pro 6000D chip.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told reporters he was "disappointed" to hear the news of the reported ban. He's previously described Huawei as a "formidable" competitor.How Huawei ascended from telecoms to become China's 'jack of all trades' AI leaderSubscribe to CNBC PROSubscribe to Investing ClubLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSelect Personal FinanceCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelSupply Chain ValuesClosed CaptioningDigital ProductsNews ReleasesInternshipsCorrectionsAbout CNBCAd ChoicesSite MapPodcastsCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?
