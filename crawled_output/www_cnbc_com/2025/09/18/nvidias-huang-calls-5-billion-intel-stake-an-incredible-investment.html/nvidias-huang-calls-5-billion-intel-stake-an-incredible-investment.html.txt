Kent Nishimura | ReutersNvidia CEO Jensen Huang said that the company's $5 billion investment and technology collaboration with Intel comes after the two companies held discussions for nearly a year.Huang said that he communicated personally with Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan about the partnership. He called Tan a "longtime friend" on a Thursday call with reporters after the companies announced that Nvidia would co-develop data center and PC chips with Intel as part of the investment deal. On the call, Tan said he and Huang have known each other for 30 years."We thought it was going to be such an incredible investment," Huang said.Nvidia said it will collaborate with the chipmaker to create artificial intelligence systems for data centers that combine Intel's x86-based central processors with Nvidia's graphics processors and networking.Intel will also sell CPUs for PCs and notebooks that integrate Nvidia graphics processors, or GPUs.The transaction itself took a few months to come together, Intel's revenue chief Greg Ernst wrote in a LinkedIn post, adding that the agreement was reached on Saturday.The investment highlights how the fortunes of the two companies have switched atop Silicon Valley's pecking order as a result of the AI explosion ushered in by OpenAI's launch of ChatGPT in late 2022.Intel shares are down 31.78% in the last five years, while Nvidia shares are up 1,348% as of opening prices on Thursday. Nvidia is worth over $4.25 trillion, while Intel is only worth $143 billion.How Intel and Nvidia will collaborateFor decades, the most important part in a PC or server was the central processor, and Intel dominated the market for those chips. But AI infrastructure, like the machines in the $4 billion data center Microsoft announced on Thursday, often needs two or more Nvidia GPUs for every one CPU.Nvidia AI systems, like the NVL72 used by Microsoft, come with Arm-based CPUs, instead of Intel x86-based CPUs. On the call, Huang said Nvidia will soon support Intel's CPUs in its NVLink racks for AI."We'll buy those CPUs from from Intel, and then we'll connect it into super chips that then becomes our compute node, that then gets integrated into a rack scale AI supercomputer," Huang said.Nvidia will also contribute GPU technology to Intel chips that ship in laptops and PCs, which is an underserved market, Huang said. In total, the addressable markets for the two product collaborations are worth $50 billion, Huang said."We're going to become a very large customer of Intel CPUs, and we're going to be a large supplier of GPU chiplets into Intel" chips, he said.Huang said the deal with Intel will have "no" impact on Nvidia's business relationship with Arm.Thursday's investment deal is focused on the relationship between Nvidia and Intel's product division, not its foundry. The two companies, however, did not rule out future foundry partnerships."We've always evaluated Intel's foundry technology, and we're going to continue to do it, but today, this announcement, is squarely focused on these custom CPUs," Huang said. Nvidia currently uses Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company to manufacture its chips.The collaboration will use Intel's packaging, which is a part chip manufacturing that occurs toward the end of the process and combines several chip components into a single part that can be installed in machines.Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan makes a speech on stage in Taipei, Taiwan May 19, 2025. Ann Wang | ReutersTan said he was grateful for Nvidia's vote of confidence."'I'd like to thank Jensen for the confidence in me, and our team and Intel will work really hard to make sure it's a good return for you," Tan said.Last year, Intel's board removed previous CEO Pat Gelsinger because of rising costs in its manufacturing business and the company's failure to gain a foothold in AI chips. In March, Intel named Tan, a well-connected investor who had turned around chip software firm Cadence Design Systems, its new chief executive.Tan has focused on cutting costs and raising money in his short tenure leading Intel even as the future of the company's manufacturing business, called Intel Foundry, remains unclear.In addition to the $5 billion from Nvidia and $8.9 billion from the U.S. government, Intel has taken a $2 billion investment from SoftBank, sold a majority stake in its ASIC subsidiary Altera to Silver Lake for $3.3 billion and sold $1 billion in stock from Mobileye, its self-driving car subsidiary.Intel has also cut significant staff, saying in July that it would eliminate 15% of its workforce by the end of the year.The company develops its own chips as well as manufacturing them. It wants to manufacture chips for companies like Nvidia or Apple, but has yet to secure them as customers. Analysts say Intel needs a big foundry client to signal that its technology is stable and ready for volume production.But cutting-edge chip manufacturing is expensive, and Intel has signaled that if it can't get enough customers, it may not continue investing in its foundry. That could spark a reaction from Washington, whose politicians and lobbyists consider Intel to be strategically important for the nation because it is the only American company capable of manufacturing the most advanced chips.The Trump administration took a 10% stake in Intel in August. Intel was previously in line to receive $8.9 billion in grants and loans from the CHIPS Act, but the Trump administration asked and received an equity stake in the chipmaker in exchange for the money.Huang was with Trump this week in England to attend a State Dinner at Windsor Palace and announce new projects and investments in the U.K. But the Trump administration wasn't involved in this deal, according to a White House official and Huang."Intel's new partnership with Nvidia is a major milestone for American high-tech manufacturing," White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement.-- CNBC's Megan Cassella contributed to this storyWATCH: Nvidia wants Intel's consumer business, says Deepwater's Gene Munsterwatch nowVIDEO3:2703:27Nvidia wants Intel's consumer business, says Deepwater's Gene MunsterThe ExchangeSubscribe to CNBC PROSubscribe to Investing ClubLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSelect Personal FinanceCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelSupply Chain ValuesClosed CaptioningDigital ProductsNews ReleasesInternshipsCorrectionsAbout CNBCAd ChoicesSite MapPodcastsCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?
