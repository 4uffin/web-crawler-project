The cash and stock deal is reminiscent of high-profile acquihires orchestrated by Meta and Google. Nvidia invested in Enfabrica as part of a $125 million funding round in 2023.

Chesnot | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty ImagesNvidia has just shelled out over $900 million to hire Enfabrica CEO Rochan Sankar and other employees at the artificial intelligence hardware startup, and to license the company's technology, CNBC has learned.In a deal reminiscent of recent AI talent acquisitions made by Meta and Google, Nvidia is paying cash and stock in the transaction, according to two people familiar with the arrangement. The deal closed last week, and Enfabrica CEO Rochan Sankar has joined Nvidia, said the people, who asked not to be named because the matter is private.Nvidia has served as the backbone of the AI boom that began with the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in late 2022. The company's graphics processing units (GPUs), which are generally purchased in large clusters, power the training of large language models and allow for big cloud providers to offer AI services to clients.Enfabrica, founded in 2019, says its technology can connect more than 100,000 GPUs together. It's a solution that could help Nvidia offer integrated systems around its chips so clusters can effectively serve as a single computer.A spokesperson for Nvidia declined to comment, and Enfabrica didn't provide a comment for this story.While Nvidia's earlier AI chips like the A100 were single processors slotted into servers, its most recent products come in tall racks with 72 GPUs installed working together. That's the kind of system inside the $4 billion data center in Wisconsin that Microsoft announced on Thursday.Nvidia previously invested in Enfabrica as part of a $125 million Series B round in 2023 that was led by Atreides Management. The company didn't disclose its valuation at the time, but said that it was a fivefold increase from its Series A funding.Late last year, Enfabrica raised another $115 million from investors including Spark Capital, Arm, Samsung and Cisco. According to PitchBook, the post-money valuation was about $600 million.Tech giants Meta, Google, Microsoft and Amazon have all poured money into hiring top AI talent through deals that resemble acquihires. The transactions allow the companies to bring in top engineers and researchers without worrying about the regulatory hassles that come with acquisitions.The biggest such deal came in June, when Meta spent $14.3 billion on Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang and others and took a 49% stake in the AI startup. A month later, Google announced an agreement to bring in Varun Mohan, co-founder and CEO of artificial intelligence coding startup Windsurf, and other research and development employees in a $2.4 billion deal that also included licensing fees.Last year, Google made a similar deal to bring in the founders of Character.AI. Microsoft did the same thing for Inflection, as did Amazon for Adept.While Nvidia has been a big investor in AI technologies and infrastructure, it hasn't been a significant acquirer. The company's only billion-dollar-plus deal was for Israeli chip designer Mellanox, a $6.9 billion purchase announced in 2019. Much of Nvidia's current Blackwell product lineup is enabled by networking technology that it acquired through that acquisition.Nvidia tried to buy chip design company Arm, but that deal collapsed in 2022 due to regulatory pressure. In the past year, Nvidia closed a $700 million purchase of Run:ai, an Israeli company whose technology helps software makers optimize their infrastructure for AI.On Thursday, Nvidia announced one of its most sizable investments to date. The chipmaker said it's taken a $5 billion stake in Intel, and announced that the two companies will collaborate on AI processors. Nvidia also said this week that it invested close to $700 million in U.K. data center startup Nscale.— Correction: A prior version of this story mistakenly included the name of a company as an investor in Enfabrica.WATCH: Nvidia CEO says he's delighted to work with Intelwatch nowVIDEO2:1002:10Nvidia CEO: Delighted to work with Intel in 'great partnership'The ExchangeSubscribe to CNBC PROSubscribe to Investing ClubLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSelect Personal FinanceCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelSupply Chain ValuesClosed CaptioningDigital ProductsNews ReleasesInternshipsCorrectionsAbout CNBCAd ChoicesSite MapPodcastsCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?
