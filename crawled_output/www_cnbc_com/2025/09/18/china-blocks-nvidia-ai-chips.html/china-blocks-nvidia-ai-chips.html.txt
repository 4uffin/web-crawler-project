Analysts contend that capacity is also a major barrier, with the domestic industry still unable to produce enough chips at scale. Reporting from the FT suggests Beijing has also become more confident in this area, with local chipmakers seeking to triple the country's total output of AI processors next year. "All these recent actions show that China has much more confidence in their domestic sector than they used to," said Qingyuan Lin, a senior analyst covering China semiconductors at Bernstein.China's chip progressThere are signs that China's AI ecosystem has been progressing. Chinese tech giant Huawei announced Thursday new AI compute infrastructure using its in-house Ascend chips, claiming they would be the "world’s most powerful."Research firm SemiAnalysis found in April that Huawei's latest-generation CloudMatrix system was able to outperform Nvidia's competing AI compute system on some metrics — despite each Ascend chip delivering only about one-third the performance of an Nvidia processor. Huawei built its advantage by having five times as many chips linked together.Meanwhile, Chinese AI start-up DeepSeek had hinted last month that its latest AI model would be compatible with the country's "next generation" homegrown AI chips. China's Alibaba and Baidu have reportedly started using internally designed chips to help train their AI models, partly replacing those made by Nvidia. Still, analysts are skeptical about China's ability to cut its dependence on Nvidia chips. "In terms of China's domestic chip preparedness, I believe it is misleading to suggest the country can advance AI at a current level solely with domestic alternatives and without NVIDIA's systematic offerings," Ray Wang, research director for semiconductors, supply chain and emerging technology at Futurum Group, told CNBC. Seeking leverage? Experts, while agreeing that China has become more confident in its ability to counter Nvidia, suggest the country could be using access to its market as leverage in trade negotiations with the U.S. "The move is likely to be a negotiation tactic as part of a broader set of discussions involving other topics including tariffs. China is no doubt trying to encourage and establish silicon self sovereignty, while also getting the best possible chip in the meantime," AJ Kourabi, analyst at SeminAlysis, told CNBC. The U.S. has indicated that it might allow even more advanced Nvidia chips than the H20 into the Chinese market. watch nowVIDEO6:3606:36The TikTok deal could be a blueprint for thawing tense U.S.-China relations, says Plexo's Lo ToneySquawk BoxUnder the Joe Biden administration, export controls on advanced chips had been increasingly tightened with the aim of blocking China's access to the best American technology. That trend after accelerating initially under the Trump administration is now reversing.According to Reva Goujon, director at Rhodium Group, by rejecting the H20 and RTX Pro, Beijing could be looking to create an opportunity to negotiate access to more advanced GPUs.She added that it's likely not a coincidence that it comes amid other leverage-building by China this week, referring to its recent anti-dumping investigation into imports of certain analog chips from the U.S."As Beijing tests Trump's transactionalism, it has to build up leverage of its own," she said.Subscribe to CNBC PROSubscribe to Investing ClubLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSelect Personal FinanceCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelSupply Chain ValuesClosed CaptioningDigital ProductsNews ReleasesInternshipsCorrectionsAbout CNBCAd ChoicesSite MapPodcastsCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?
