Josh Shapiro's residence and the two assassination attempts against President Donald Trump last summer.Punchbowl News first reported the administration's request.More from NBC News:Trump says he wants national healing — while blaming 'radical left'Sen. Graham calls Kirk killing 'an attack on a political movement'How Charlie Kirk helped set Vance on a path to the vice presidencyHouse Democrats are expected to hold a virtual briefing Sunday with the House sergeant at arms and the Capitol Police chief to discuss member security, according to an invitation obtained by NBC News.The invitation was also extended to members' spouses or significant others.Reacting to the news of the additional funding request Sunday, some lawmakers expressed support for the measure, saying they hope Congress will "step up" and agree to bulk up funding for security, citing an uptick in political violence."I hope we will invest in securing our public life, because incidents like this tragedy in Utah, like the murder of Melissa and her husband, Mark Hortman, in Minnesota, frankly, fuel further anger in our country. And the ways in which folks are then taking the horrific images of these incidents and propagating them on the internet adds fuel to the fire," Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., said Sunday during a joint interview with Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., on CBS' "Face the Nation."Lankford agreed with Coons' remarks, saying the funding goes beyond protecting individuals and also safeguards the country's ability to have civil discourse."When we're talking about protecting judges and protecting individuals, it's not just their personal safety. It is really declaring to the nation that we believe that these tasks are hard, that there should be intense debate, that we have very different perspectives," Lankford said.Subscribe to CNBC PROSubscribe to Investing ClubLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSelect Personal FinanceCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelSupply Chain ValuesClosed CaptioningDigital ProductsNews ReleasesInternshipsCorrectionsAbout CNBCAd ChoicesSite MapPodcastsCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?
