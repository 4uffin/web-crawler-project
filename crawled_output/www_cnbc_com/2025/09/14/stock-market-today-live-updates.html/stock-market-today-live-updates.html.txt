Brendan McDermid | ReutersU.S. stock futures were little changed Sunday night after the Nasdaq Composite closed at a fresh record high, with investors bracing for a crucial Federal Reserve meeting this week.Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose by 25 points, or 0.05%. S&P 500 futures edged up 0.05% and Nasdaq 100 futures added 0.05%.Those moves come after the major averages finished out a strong week. In particular, the Nasdaq Composite closed at a record, rising 2% for its second winning week in a row. The S&P 500 gained 1.6%, posting its best weekly performance since early August. The Dow wrapped up its first positive week in three.The strong gains come after the latest economic data showing a weakening labor market and tame inflation spurred hopes the Fed will cut interest rates when it concludes its meeting on Wednesday. The market was last pricing in a 96% certainty that the central bank will lower interest rates by a quarter percentage point, with a meager 3.6% likelihood of a steeper half percentage point cut, according to the CME FedWatch Tool."All sorts of flags are leaning toward the Fed putting in a 25 basis point cut in here," said Mark Malek, investment chief at Siebert Financial.Lower rates could continue to support the stock market, which has received a boost from investor enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence, and despite risks to the economic outlook. Investors will also be watching the Senate to see if Stephen Miran will be sworn in as a Fed governor in time for this week's FOMC meeting.On Monday, the Empire State Manufacturing Index is due out.
