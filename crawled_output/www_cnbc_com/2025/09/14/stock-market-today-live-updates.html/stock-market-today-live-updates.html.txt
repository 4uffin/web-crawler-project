Investors also braced for a key Federal Reserve meeting this week.The S&P 500 climbed to a fresh record, up 0.4%. The Nasdaq Composite also advanced to a new all-time high, trading 0.8% higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average hovered above the flatline.Top U.S. and Chinese officials for a second day discussed tariff rates and a deadline for the sale of Chinese-owned social media TikTok. In a Truth Social post, Trump said the meeting between officials had been positive and that a deal "was also reached on a 'certain' company that young people in our Country very much wanted to save," potentially referring to TikTok. The U.S. will go ahead on its TikTok ban if China does give up its demands for reduced tariffs and tech restrictions, Reuters reported on Monday, citing a a senior U.S. official with knowledge of negotiations.As talks between the countries continued, China's market regulator said Nvidia violated the country's anti-monopoly law and that it would continue its probe into the chipmaker. Nvidia shares dropped 1.8%.Tesla shares jumped 7% after CEO Elon Musk disclosed an insider purchase of the stock worth about $1 billion, his largest buy in the open market ever and his first significant purchase since 2020. Traders took the buy as a vote of confidence by Musk in the company, which is attempting to turn its focus towards robotics as electric vehicle competition has intensified.Monday's gains come after the latest economic data showing a weakening labor market and tame inflation spurred hopes the Fed will cut interest rates when it concludes its meeting on Wednesday. The market was last pricing in a 96% certainty that the central bank will lower interest rates by a quarter percentage point, with a meager 3.6% likelihood of a steeper half percentage point cut, according to the CME FedWatch Tool."The market is fully expecting the Fed to start a series of rate cuts at this week's meeting," Scott Wren, Wells Fargo Investment Institute senior global market strategist, said. "Much of today's action is traders getting positioned for Wednesday's announcement. This could be a "Buy the rumor, sell the fact" event but it is safe to say market participants likely to not want to go into Wednesday short the SPX."Lower rates could continue to support the stock market, which has received a boost from investor enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence, and despite risks to the economic outlook. Investors will also be watching the Senate to see if Stephen Miran will be sworn in as a Fed governor in time for this week's FOMC meeting.17 Min AgoBernstein hikes price target on McDonald'sBernstein sees limited upside for McDonald's amid the fast-food company's launch of its extra value meals. The firm reiterated its market-perform rating on Sunday and raised its price target to $320 from $310, implying 5% upside from Friday's close"We believe that EVM will lead to marginally higher SSSG [same-store-sales growth] in the near term, but not enough to maintain franchisees' profitability at today's levels," analyst Danilo Garguilo said in a note to clients.While he expects investors to continue rewarding McDonald's for its earnings visibility and near-term catalysts, the stock has increased its valuation gap versus its peers since the launch of the $5 meal deal in June 2024.The stock is up 4% year to date.— Michelle Fox1 Hour AgoNetflix is still a strong contender to bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, Wells Fargo saysBeata Zawrzel | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesDon't count Netflix out as a potential bidder for Warner Bros. Discovery, Wells Fargo wrote in a Sunday note.Last week, before The Wall Street Journal reported that Paramount Skydance was preparing a majority cash bid for Warner Bros., Wells Fargo analyst Steven Cahall wrote that Netflix was the most likely candidate to buy the company. Netflix potentially entering the game still remains a strong possibility, Cahall added in his Sunday follow-up note."We think a PSKY/Ellison bid is likely, a NFLX bid is 50/50 and we don't expect others. PSKY may start things at ~$25/sh (justified by synergies) while NFLX may top out at ~$30/sh," the analyst said. "While we think NFLX could enter the fray, it's a big decision for a company with a strong build bias, and it's a big What If for WBD shareholders. NFLX may opt for accel'ing its content investments vs a bidding war with the Ellisons. If they bow out before things heat up then PSKY can make an offer closer to the current price. We prefer the sidelines."Cahall added that buying Warner Bros. Discovery could make Paramount Skydance the leader in media. This possibility should compel Netflix even more to put in a bid, since it could potentially pay "a price for not buying it and risking PSKY+WBD."— Lisa Kailai Han1 Hour AgoNvidia bucks Big Tech rallyBig Tech stocks surged on Monday, but with one notable exception: Nvidia.Nvidia was the only stock in the Magnificent Seven tracking to end the session in the red.

Redburn hikes Disney price targetWalt Disney Company is poised for a boost due to its streaming platform's upcoming merger with Hulu, analysts at Rothschild & Co. Redburn said Monday in a note. The financial advisory group raised its price target for the company to $160 from $147. "The upcoming merger of Disney+ and Hulu should drive higher engagement and lower subscriber churn," the analysts said, adding that the entertainment hubs had roughly double the subscriber turnover of streaming giant Netflix as of writing time.After the merger, Disney+ and Hulu's could boast a combined subscriber count equal to 80% of Netflix's user base, according to the analysts' forecast.  The price target hike comes as Disney's direct-to-consumer vertical, which includes its streaming service Disney+, has notched "tepid" growth over the past few financial periods.
