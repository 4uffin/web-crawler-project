Ivan Dolcek has been hugely impressive today but that is a contender for worst free-kick of the 20th Century as he drills the ball straight out of play from near the byeline.

It's been a cracking game so far and the message from both managers is likely to be 'more of the same'.Hibs boss David Gray would like a more clinical edge in front of goal though.United have shown their threat on the counter and the home side are going to leave a few more gaps as they try to get back into this one.

Just watching replays of that second United goal. Does Jordan Smith really need to come rushing out to confront Ivan Dolcek? Hard to blame the keeper when the defence has left him so exposed.

Although Shankland's spot kick was saved by Butland, the striker slotted the rebound to leave the home side and their support stunned - and it could have been worse had TÃ³mas Bent MagnÃºsson not found the far post in the dying seconds.Analysis: Rangers nightmare leaves Hearts dreamingPressure can only mount on Martin from Rangers fans after another dismal result and display.The former Rangers defender talked about seeking a "reset" to build on their goalless draw with Celtic last time out and the work on the training ground that followed during the international break.There was little evidence of that in an opening 45 minutes full of nerves, with the disjointed hosts looking like a bunch of individuals facing a well-oiled machine rather than a cohesive unit.It looked every bit a match-up between a side sitting six points clear of hosts who had struggled to four opening draws.The defeat will increase the questions being asked about the continued absence of Nicolas Raskin despite the midfielder scoring for Belgium in midweek.Martin decided to start Canada centre-half Cornelius and big-money striker signing Youssef Chermiti on the bench and their introduction after the break came too late to change the course of the game.To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.This video can not be playedMedia caption, 'How long can this go on?' - Boos ring around IbroxHearts head coach Derek McInnes had asked his players to come to Ibrox with belief based on their early season form and they had that in spades.After more than a quarter of a century without an Aberdeen win in Glasgow, McInnes led the Dons to three wins at Ibrox and also defeated Rangers in a League Cup semi-final at Hampden.The Scot often linked with the Rangers job got it right again, handing Schwolow a start ahead of Scotland goalkeeper Zander Clark, and will have his fans believing investor Tony Bloom's claim that they are in a position to split the Old Firm this season.What they saidRangers head coach Russell Martin: "Three tough decisions went against us. Ours was definitely a goal and there was a hand ball before their first one."There is a lot of anxiety, a lot of difficulty managing expectation. We have so many players trying to feel their way into their Rangers career in a really difficult situation."It is not going to be an easy journey for me to win favour. It hasn't been from day one with a lot of people, but we'll keep working and make sure it does.Hearts head coach Derek McInnes: "It is an important win for us in terms of giving belief to a lot of the new lads and the lads who have been here a while who have been scarred by not winning at places at Ibrox."Everybody was making reference to our poor record here and it is good to put that to bed. It was an absolute masterclass by Lawrence Shankland up front."What's next for these teams?Rangers host the other half of Edinburgh when Hibernian visit next Saturday (17:45 BST) in the Premier Sports Cup quarter-finals, while Hearts are not in action against until hosting Falkirk the Premiership in a fortnight, with the Ibrox side visiting Livingston the following day (both 15:00).
