Looks cool, I like the use of decorators as a means to use essentially turn python into some sort of DSL.One nitpick: Please include a paragraph/section/infobox explaining what eBPF is and what problems should be solved using it. I am a huge fan of making our tech world more accessible and as such we should think to some degree about people who don't know every acronym.reply
