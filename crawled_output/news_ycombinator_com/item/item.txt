> prevents me from taking screenshots if an app author doesn't want me toThe most frustrating part about this "feature" is that you don't know it's enabled until the screenshot is taken and you're left with a picture of nothing.That and some app authors thinking they're protecting you with this (referring to banking apps in particular)replyGuB-42 9 hours ago

It is not for preventing you from taking screenshots, if you insist, you can do it with another camera. It is to prevent malware and "helpful" AI tools from doing it for you and then uploading the picture to who knows where. Signal does this too, though I think it is optional.Beyond preventing screenshots, it blacks out the window content in the task switcher, which is useful if someone is looking over your shoulder. This, by the way, is a good way to check if screenshots are allowed. If the window appears black in the task switcher, screenshots won't work.The idea is similar to the "**" password fields.replythmsths 9 hours ago

I mean if the goal is to prevent potential malicious apps from taking screenshots automatically; instead of saving a clueless user from themselves or worse getting in the way of legitimate users I believe that the proper solution is to disallow programmatic screenshots while still allowing screenshots when there is the correct button press (and ensure that this cannot be emulated). Windows reserves ctrl-alt-delete as a direct signal to the kernel for security purposes. Why can't android do the same?replymdp2021 4 hours ago

I think the threat model here is that a different, malicious app (compromised, installed accidentally or by the means of social engineering) might take screenshots of your screen and forward them to take advantage of you. You can file this under one's "own stupidity" as well, sure, but in the end they're not protecting you, they're protecting themselves, because banks might be liable for these kind of things, and by imposing these restrictions, they're reducing the amount of fraud and thus improve their bottom line.replyshmel 11 hours ago

Are you implying that Google is unable to distinguish whether a screenshot is triggered via a combination of hardware buttons vs via a software call from another app that isn't even on the foreground in their own ecosystem? That's a quite sad state of affairs, isn't it?replyZak 10 hours ago

I've been unimpressed with Google's commitment to making the fundamentals of Android great. They seem to prefer doing the minimum required there and putting all their efforts into something more sexy, like generating fake photos that look like they were taken with a 2400mm lens.I don't want my phone to generate fake photos; I do want it to always let me manually take screenshots, but require turning on a permission that's a little awkward to find to allow an app to do so.replyteaearlgraycold 5 hours ago

I see this argument everywhere and I've never heard of a case where a bank was liable because a customer was phished. I've even asked for examples and nobody ever provided them.It's one thing to argue in court that they should be liable because they didn't provide you with the necessary security tools (like MFA), but they all provide at least SMS 2FA these days and their apps run on iOS and Android, both of which have plenty of security features.replycwillu 12 hours ago

In reality what happened is that some security auditor put it into a checklist for the mobile app "Security ISO certificate++" and now everyone implements it for compliance.Fighting against that is insane paperwork and professional exposure for software engineers that do it (since if people get phished, the C-suite will point a finger at a tech lead which went against the "professional security audit").Most of other posts here are just post-rationalization and victim blaming.replygodelski 3 hours ago

I think you made bad assumptions. If I installed the APK through a third party, sure, my bad. But then I agree with shmel, that there's still some blame on Google. Like why not have a default where we disable screenshots not performed by a physical action and have an advanced option for API based screenshots? It's not bulletproof but neither is the current implementation.But if I install via the playstore like most people then no, I don't think it's the user's fault. Testing every single app seems like a big ask but we're also talking about a 3 trillion dollar company. I mean FFS a 1 trillion dollar company didn't even exist 10 years ago and 10 years before that a 500b company barely did. So I think they can stand to lose some profits and do harder work.

> they're protecting themselves[citation needed]The theory here is that it provides a marginal security improvement if there is malware on the phone, but if there is malware on the phone then there are a hundred other things it can do to the same effect and you're likely screwed anyway. And by doing this, you also block the user from taking screenshots, which is bad, because screenshots are harder for computers to parse, and that's a marginal security advantage. If the user is going to send e.g. their account number to someone else (for a legitimate reason), it's better that they do it as a screenshot than that you force them to type it as text, because text is machine searchable. Which is worse when that messaging system gets compromised and then the attacker can do a text search for a pattern matching a bank routing number and be more likely to discover that message than if it was only there in a JPG.Meanwhile the primary consequence of preventing screenshots is to inconvenience customers, which is an actual cost to the bank, because there is only a threshold amount of BS customers will put up with before switching banks and banks are constantly pushing up against that line already with all of their other BS.But then the lower-quality banks do it anyway because there is a box they can check which sounds like it's locking something down, so they check it without thinking. Which is a great canary for customers who want to know if their bank is dumb -- if they require this then they probably do all kinds of other dumb stuff and it's a strong indication you should switch banks before you get screwed by them doing some other foolish nonsense.replyhigh_na_euv 10 hours ago

Citrix Netscaler nowadays apparently wants to be extra secure and shows you the most generic error message if you have a typo in either your password or user name and just tells you to "try again later", so you do until you lock yourself out.

Yes, this obsession of providing non-technology services (banking, bureaucracy, identification, ...) apps first (sometimes only, at least to various, sometimes important details of the use/access) which is a hugely demanding matter on users (choose, purchase, pay, setup, learn, re-learn, update, maintain, subscribe, know and accept terms, charge, protect, both physically and data wise, click away suggestions and self promotions while busy with something important) that it is a very bitter pill to swallow.replyfigmert 13 hours ago

Now consider the fact that an arbitrary other app can take a screenshot clandestinely, via API.

For, say, $50 million, you could get the blueprints to an Android phone and port your choice of Linux userland and get drivers working, and then do a run of 20,000, sell them for $1100. Compared to training GPT5, $50 million is cheap.

I get where that one is coming from though - tap-to-pay is considered second-factor-authenticated, aka no PIN entry is necessary at the PoS terminal because the user already entered their PIN or presented biometric credentials to the smartphone.If a malware were able to snatch the key material that represents the credit card outright or it could (by running as root) act to the TEE like it were Google Pay's NFC controller app, it would enable the actor controlling the malware to spoof the credit card on their own phone... and since tap-to-pay is considered authenticated, chances are next to zero you can dispute the payment.replynani8ot 10 hours ago

| root | parent | next [–]
The Danish MitID identity "service" is actually pretty clever, except for the app used to approve actions or requests on your behalf. It's designed in a way that ensure that it can verify your age, but reveal nothing else about you. It isn't going to be used for "Porn ID" though. Instead it will provide your age information, basically 15+ or 18+ (I think those are the options), to an identity wallet, which in term will validate your age to the porn sites. Unlike the UK version there's no reason to have your face scanned, because the Danish government already knows your age and can provide that information via a trusted channel, MitID.That's probably the issue the other post aludes to. The identity wallet will only be available via Google Play or the Apple App Store (as far as we know). So without a phone and a Google or Apple account, you're won't be able to provide your age information to e.g. PornHub.replyulrikrasmussen 10 hours ago

Exactly this. Except the new service is not released as part of MitID but as part of the new digital wallet app (den digitale tegnebog). This is a separate and "voluntary" app which is meant to be offered as a convenience. Except it isn't really voluntary when the app is introduced together with new regulation that requires you to verify your age in places where you were previously anonymous, and the only way to actually stay anonymous and retain access is via the app.replynicman23 17 hours ago

What kind of argumentation is this? Just because someone decides to show stuff, everybody else is also required to show themselves?
e.g. If I go to a theater where the actors are clearly identified, I have to be okay to get a facial scan as well?Some people tend to demonize porn, and it might be unethical in their eyes, but fact is: it is not illegal (in most countries).
I don't argue that there are issues in the porn industry, but this is an issue with the platforms, that they don't allow the upload of non-consentual material, or and have processes to take it down. This is a 'THEIR' problem (the platform not the victims).There some of these issues also exist in the standard movie and music industry as well. Hell, it even goes up to company executives and politics. But this is up to law enforcement do their job and to remove the illegal stuff and prosecute the involved persons, not by branding everyone as a suspect.replycraftkiller 21 hours ago

What do you mean by 'Belgium is not a nation state', if i may ask?replybonoboTP 14 hours ago
| root | parent | next [–]
They probably mean that Belgium consists of French-speaking and Dutch-speaking (and German-speaking) groups, which the person counts as separate nations, hence Belgium not being one nation.This is mostly a language confusion for non-native English speakers. Nation, country, state, a people, nationality, ethnicity, citizenship etc. are used in confusing ways for speakers of other languages.For many, "nation state" just means an independent state (roughly speaking, a UN member, note also that the UN is called United Nations), because just saying "state" could mean a subdivision, such as a US state. And "country" can be confused with the subdivision of the UK (they call, e.g. Scotland a "country").In more precise contexts of political history, "nation state" mostly refers to modern (post-World War I) countries that more or less correspond to a people speaking the same language and having the same ethnic identity. It delineates nation states from the previously more common multi-ethnic empires and kingdoms, such as Austria-Hungary or the Holy Roman Empire etc.Similarly, in English, nationality is often an exact synonym for citizenship, while speakers of other languages expect it to mean ethnicity, e.g. an ethnic Hungarian in Romania with Romanian citizenship would be considered a "Romanian national" in English-language news. This often makes people confused/angry. Also, in some contexts in English, "ethnicity" is more like a euphemism for something like "race", but not quite (e.g. in the US "Latino" is considered an "ethnicity" but not a race). In that sense "Hungarian" would not count as an "ethnicity" at all, but still phrases like "ethnic Slovak" refer to a minority group in a different country than Slovakia. But also "ethnic" can also just mean with "exotic foreign origin", e.g. "ethnic food" or "an ethnic woman" (this was really weird when I first read it). But I digress.replyrkomorn 13 hours ago

I mean that there is no Belgian nation - native Belgian citizens are mostly either Dutch-speaking Flemish people or French-speaking Wallons, and generally don't have any significant notion of a shared national identity.Note that this doesn't mean that a state with multiple ethnicities/languages can't be a nation state. Indians, for example, generally have a clear national identity, despite being citizens of a huge federal republic with dozens if not hundreds of languages spoken, some of which don't even share a common language family. So, India is a nation state, unlike Belgium.replytmtvl 15 hours ago

Android's Multiple Users feature does exactly this. Multiple users accounts with all user data completely sandboxed and restricted to each user. All user data is cryptographically protected on storage devices.The actual SE filesystem available to a logged in user is pretty complicated. But the short story is that user-data is completely isolated. Presumably application binaries (which require digital signatures by default) are shared; although the "installed" state is not. Successive releases of Android have restricted access to any legacy "shared" data on the device (media folders particularly; pictures and video taken by the camera device have been strongly protected since Forever).Verified checksums on a blockchain are only useful if they are verified by some provider who associates a blockchain ID with a real-world identity. Not sure what "blockchain" really adds. If anyone can create a blockchain ID, then "verification" doesn't really provide useful information.replyemporas 10 hours ago

N hours of actual use, in isolation, is just the matter of calculating average power draw[W] by runtime[hr] and buying the battery with Wh figures comfortably bigger than that.e.g. your device consumed 1 Watt on average, you wanted 8 hour runtime, then you need a battery with 8 Watt-hours, or 2,162.162162162162 mAh at 3.7V of capacity, before factoring in buffers of various kinds. But it's also roughly the datasheet nominal capacity of a single 18650 cell.You don't worry about daily battery life on mainstream mobile devices and you can fall asleep with YouTube playing and it's still playing when you wake up because manufacturers know consumers do that and optimize the phone to make that work. They probably reduce display brightness, cut powers to mics and P cores, ask 3M to make the pouch films 1% thinner so battery could be few more percent bigger inside, fudge battery gauges so you would be nudged correctly to have enough charge before you fall asleep, the list goes as far as your imagination could possibly go.The fact that same behaviors don't happen on Linux devices, even with something like four of fresh 18650s, means the list ends before it begins.

This is a big part of why Android was developed in the first place. The operating system and application architecture that makes sense on desktop just doesn't make sense on mobile.

The architecture can work if enough smart people are put to work on it. That's how Apple managed to turn macOS into a mobile operating system.I think UBPorts and Sailfish prove that Linux for phones is practical if you're willing to rely on Linux applications that stick to mobile friendly APIs.You need to configure and compile your Linux kernel for aggressive power saving, of course. Seeing how Linux currently struggles to effectively do power management on laptops without S3 sleep, there's plenty of work to be done if you want to use it with a phone.It's not just about app developers either, Qualcomm's modifications to the Linux kernel are public thanks to GPL but most phone kernel modifications haven't made it into the upstream kernel so far.

By making a soft and then a hard suspend the reality they have to abide by, or otherwise they are killed and users will think they are broken apps.Mobile apps just had to "grow up" in this environment, plus they have proper APIs for this two-way communication between OS and the app. Android will just ask the app to save its state and then simply unload it from memory (after a while) - but this also makes perfect sense for the desktop scene, you also want to improve energy efficiency there.

Then I carried around a cheap Motorola Android phone that had no sim card but could run Google Play apps and when it needed wifi I shared that from the Jolla and otherwise it was fully offline and most of the time turned off.So the phone that was closer to a small laptop was the one I actually used as a phone. Not sure if that is the setup I would go for again or if I would do it the other way around with the Google phone being the phone. If I do the latter I guess something like a very small Linux netbook would work as a second device, it such a thing exists.replytim333 8 hours ago

But like, it won't matter how many viable Linux phones there are if the government tells you that if you want to pay your taxes you must first buy a piece of hardware blessed by an american corporation and running blessed software which doesn't let you control the device in order to access the tax payment portal.Because if you don't pay your taxes, the government will insist that you go to prison.The problem isn't really what google is doing, the problem is that were letting our existence as free citizens in a society depend on a piece of blessed hardware/software we must carry around with us everywhere we go.We need to strongly resist having software/to become strongly codependant on hardware broadly speaking.

While I share the concerns about Android, it feels silly to me to go back to Linux's (nonexistent) security model and bad mobile UI/UX. Why not try to fork AOSP or GOS (for broader device compatibility, even if it means giving up some its sexy security properties)?Note that this could include packaging Linux GUI applications as Android APKs (with some additional glue code and Wayland/DBus integration of course), so it's not even an either or.replyfsflover 10 hours ago

(Warning: Am only a software/product engineer, playing dilettante here, not an actual marketing/business expert.)Awhile back, I was thinking that one pragmatic way to get this viable Linux smartphone moving might be for hobbyists to focus on getting one easily available, affordable device working fully with pure Debian or PostmarketOS (no closed drivers or other modules, and preferably no blobs) and with Purism's Phosh.Then that would boost contributions to, and demand for, Purism's open source platform/components for Librem 5 (and whatever the successor hardware would be).If the cheap hardware is something like PinePhone, I'm just going to handwave that maybe this device won't cannibalize much sales of Purism's premium devices, but instead the community investment into the platform will effectively generate much higher net demand for Purism's premium products.
With higher volume, Purism could maybe also hit more accessible price points.If the Purism hardware demand happens, then there may be competing hardware entrants.
And they will have to compete partly on being trustworthy and aligned with the interests of the kinds of customer who want to run a non-Apple, non-Google device.
Where Purism should have a head start in credibility and goodwill.
The new entrants will have to contribute engineer time (possibly: pay community contractors) to getting their device to work well with this platform, and be expected to upstream all of it as open source to the platform mainline, if they want to be attractive to these customers.(I'm not saying the cheap device has to be PinePhone; that just seemed the most likely one at the time.
It could even be something like an older popular Pixel model, with many unlockable-bootloader units available cheap on eBay, for which people are able to assemble/develop open source drivers.
Or maybe GrapheneOS will get their own device built, and it can also be used for this non-Android-based open Linux platform.)replyTelaneo 21 hours ago

> to focus on getting one easily available, affordable device working fully with pure Debian or PostmarketOS (no closed drivers or other modules, and preferably no blobs) and with Purism's Phosh.I'm not sure how viable this is. Linux phones already opt for hardware that's as open as possible, i.e. they use parts with the most open documentation and drives, but the trade-off to that is that those parts are functionally already end-of-life when they're in the phone, either because it's an old design that's been opened up to squeeze a bit more money out of an old design, or the design was third-rate to begin with. Not to mention that the baseband side of things is closed no matter what, so the phone that's completely true to the FOSS ideals seems impossible to make no matter what. And who would buy a phone with a third-rate chip and battery life? And since very few people buy them, prices aren't able to drop any significant amount.I understand why people aren't willing to make a devils bargain in order to make a decent phone first, and then put Linux on it second, but I can't see any other way for this to happen, other than the phone market magically becoming more open somehow. If you could install Linux on any phone, since all the drivers are already out there, then we wouldn't be in this pickle, but every single Android phone out there has a different set of drivers and very few of them are open and possible to implement without an enormous amount of work, unlike the PC world, were at this point, only the really weird stuff (and Wifi from certain vendors) doesn't have some form of Linux driver.replyneilv 20 hours ago

IIUC, there have been some efforts to compartmentalize/isolate closed baseband, when you can work on the hardware.Separate from baseband, the (sub)device closed firmware blobs are non-ideal, and eventually you'd want open source even for those, but maybe don't have to be a high priority.
Mainlined open source for corresponding drivers are much higher priority.

Ultimately, it all stems from two things - for one, it's illegal to emit radio waves without a special permit. And secondly, it's also extremely hard to process radio signals at the kind of rates we expect today.Together, these facts make it so that (competitive) wireless modems require organized businesses to create, and organized businesses don't want to share their code with competitors. A foundation dedicated to creating open hardware and software for a competitive wireless modem would face giant hurdles both in regulatory terms, and in hiring people who can actually work on this extremely difficult technical challenge.Also, building an open source software for controlling wireless modems that complies with the law is probably not fully possible. Per law, to sell a wireless device, you as the manufacturer are responsible for taking reasonable precautions against users misusing it to emit in reserved bands, or to not respect military device priority in the allowed bands. If every user is extended the rights and documentation for modifying the software as they see fit, you're clearly not taking reasonable precautions to prevent them from breaking the law.replyheavyset_go 20 hours ago

Less conspiratorial answer:Bootloader unlock removal:It's actually not happening all of a sudden. The dam-breaking moment is more that Samsung, the number #1 Android vendor, decided to stop supporting it.The vendors stop maintaining bootloader-unlocking methods because the cost/benefit profile to develop/maintain/support that feature and its consequences is simply not sufficient, all while several of the biggest customers explicitly require unlock to NOT be supported.Supporting this is not just about the unlock itself, it's about allowing this unlock (required as some carriers explicitly forbid this, so a unlock needs to be requested), then performing the procedure (using a shared secret between the device and the vendor) and then the OS continuing to boot in this untrusted state with all components gracefully handling this broken trust-chain.The commercial incentive for this feature isn't there for a device-vendor, it actually never was. It was built, defended and fought for by passionate people (mostly within the R&D) of those companies. Companies which managed to implement it early (in times of higher product margins) were able to keep it longer, others simply couldn't get the budget to implement bootloader-unlock in the first place. Today, devices are shipped with commitments of several years of upgrades, without the vendor actually knowing yet how the OS-upgrade in 2 years will look like. Keeping his custom security-implementation is a risk-factor hereThe 3rd party OS developer community was always small, and became even smaller in the past years. The footprint of alternative OS users was shrinking since Cyanogen (the leading "universal kernel" developers for Android and predecessor of LineageOS) dissolved (or tried to become a for-profit).However, the events around Cyanogen were more of a public symptom, The main driver for people to stop using 3rd party OS's was:1.) The increasing fragmentation of devices in the market: When the community started, the majority of the market was Samsung, Motorola, LG, Sony. Samsung was leading, but each of them had quite healthy parts of the Android market, competing with each other in an "almost-stalemate" situation. Today Samsung is leading with a huge margin, all others are basically fighting for scraps. So naturally, most of them try to go for the lowest common denominator and find a distribution channel.2.) Android itself became more competitive: At the height of the OS community, people switched to alternative OS's to get a newer OS, new customization options and convenience features. Today, vanilla Android checks most of the convenience options already, sufficiently that most people don't want to bother researching alternative options, maintaining them, etc.
Devices of major vendors are receiving upgrades for several years (back then it was ONE major-OS Upgrade, a YEAR after Google's release, if at all)3.) Device-integrity became more important: At the height of the OS-community, there was no Device Integrity check by Google to give a flag on whether the device can be trusted or not, so all apps kept working (with minor exception of some streaming services restricting their service/resolution, as the DRM keystore became unavailable on unlock). Today, most banking and entertainment apps rely on those Google integrity checks to decide whether they should even start. This introduced another reason for users to consider their actual need for an alternative OS.--How to change that: If it's not possible to create a commercial incentive for the vendors, a regulatory incentive could be an option.It's crazy to think how much computing power is just added to a drawer or landfill every day, just because there is no reason for the vendor to allow you to repurpose it.I think this could be a path, to legally require device-vendors to provide a common SW-layer with respective documentation to utilize features of underlying hardware (optional without the shipped OS on top, disconnecting the device from the shipped ecosystem).
This would prevent e-waste and put this old hardware to better use. A community OS could then be built on top of this common SW-layer and be maintained for a wider range of devices.I would e.g. LOVE a "Browser on everything" OS which just provides a Browser OS for outdated hardware, but the only way this could work on scale would be if the device-vendor would be mandated to provide and document the lower layer...Someone would have to make the economic case for such a regulation as well, i.e. demonstrate the benefit for society if that is in place. The chances for this are razor-thin, especially in today's public/political climate.replybjord 14 hours ago

Yeah well, not in the way it progressed after the carriers started to take control over it (I was actively involved in a Firefox device-project back then).What I sketched out here with a "Browser on everything" OS would be a concept for a aftermarket OS, where the device-vendor is not required to have his OS support the unlocked HW (because he can't be forced to do that), but he will have to provide components and documentation up to a certain layer to make use of the hardware. This could then be the layer for a generic "Browser on everything" OS to work on.replyfrankzander 14 hours ago

| root | parent | next [–]
People showing their middle finger won't be enough, because the vendors are torn between two groups of interests here:1. Building a HW/SW product which works within controlled boundaries to provide warranty, support, repairs, future maintenance, Google-compliance, regulatory compliance,...2. A subset of Customers wanting the HW to be separable from the SW, for product to be open in a way that they can use it differently than intended (potentially creating "Group#3", a HW/SW product with a different SW).To create a product for Group#2, alot of the aspects of Group#1 still apply, but in a more-complicated, more-expensive manner. If there is a viable business-case for Group#2, it will be a separate more-expensive product with lower volume.But in reality, the only way a vendor could meaningfully resolve the needs of Group#2 is if ALL his devices support this feature (including customers who don't want a unlockable "open" device now), allowing everyone to become member of Group#2 without having to buy a new separate product.For this, the economic incentive doesn't exist.Explicit example: The Fairphone is a great device, but it will never sell more volume than a Samsung Flagship, because it's a device satisfying the conscious needs of a niche of customers, without the chance of reaching comparable volume to compete in all other areas.That's why the only chance I see is to create a regulatory incentive by making the requirements of Group#2 a part of Group#1, to have the "unconscious needs" of the majority also satisfied.Because only THEN the mainstream-customer can be converted to *users* of this potential "Group#3" product, and market-forces have a chance to flow freely again, if you see what I mean...replyfreefaler 13 hours ago

The government is also keen to have these devices controlled more tightly. Now with the help of the big companies so much data is on the device and in the cloud about you that policy enforcement, tax evasion or anything else that the people in the government deemed crucial for them is much more easily done.Check how China controls the Uyghurs phones and will they be happy to have "unlocked bootloaders".It's not profitable for the companies to lose total control of "your" device you "bough", nor for software developers who sell you the software to have "ReVanced" versions of their apps.

> The government is also keen to have these devices controlled more tightly.Not to oppose what you wrote, but let me try to give you a different view on the same picture to support a different conclusion:In the eye of most governments these devices play such a minor role that they practically don't even exist.What governments see is messaging services, finance services, digital marketplaces, and so on. It was and is their job to do that. They used to regulate telecom providers, financial institutions, marketplaces in the past, and they are now catching up realizing that the carrier is no longer the messaging provider, banks are not in control of all finance flows, marketplaces exist beyond the classical physical markets, etc.If you look at detailed regulation and laws, Governments still have little interest in the explicit devices, they still look at those new variants of classical services and try to adapt to them.But what the PROVIDERS of those services do, is creating pressure on the devices to help them reach lowest-effort compliance for their SERVICE-requirements (--> "let's make the end-user device bulletproof trusted, so we can offload our responsibilities to his device").This is in most cases why the devices evolve the way they do. Because they are a merge of product and services (often from the same vendor), and the product is evolving to satisfy the needs for those services.That's why fighting for "ownership of your device" is mostly futile, because the assumed opponent in this fight doesn't even feel addressed.You need to bring the fight to their topics, to the topics relevant for governments:On how a citizen ID should be verified, how financial services should be realized, how a competitive market should be ensured also on digital markets, etc.replyverisimi 16 hours ago

Less conspiratorial answer (better late than never):Google services, integrity hardening:From outside it might be difficult to understand the distinction, but Google is acting here as the owner and maintainer of a services ecosystem, which is the entire Google service-package provided to end-users. For them, Android is provided as a foundation for that package, and they increasingly experience difficulty to contain issues within that ecosystem and prevent them from spreading (piracy, malware, hacking,...).The logical way out for them to contain those issues is to ensure that members of this ecosystem (=Devices with Google Services, Developers) are vetted more strongly.Now Android has a history to be an open ecosystem, which allowed it to grow to the size it has now. But similar to the bootloader-unlock situation of device-vendors, the economic incentive of an "open ecosystem" keeps shrinking in comparison to the risks and issues it's causing Google in governing their services-ecosystem.They obviously decided now that the price they have to pay for that "open ecosystem" (less control over the services ecosystem) is not justified anymore.Now they have little room to move. In order to preserve that "open ecosystem", they would have to provide the user an option to disable Google Services entirely. But Google services are such a integral part of the OS-experience already that it which would turn the device almost into a completely separate product, different from the product the vendor initially built and the consumer initially purchased.--I don't expect this to be properly resolved for the sake of "pleasing the community". Products and Services are already so tightly combined in the Smartphone-space that it's hard for most to even understand what it is the user actually purchased when he bought the device.Now Google the service provider starts to change the users' device in order to maintain his services, and there is no up-to-date definition to what degree they are actually allowed to do this.How to change that: The underlying customer-protection framework is missing. A solution would be a general legally binding definition of what functions a customer owns if (and when) a device is stripped of any services on top.If my car loses functions once it loses connection to the manufacturer, this bare set should be communicated as the purchased value ("in exchange for your money"), separately from any on-top ("in exchange for your data") business-model.In theory this could create competition on the actual purchased value again, instead of continuing to offload the value from the device to some service provided by the vendor/service-provider...But that's such a complex topic, the implications should be studied much deeper. Also, I don't expect political bodies to fully understand it for years to come, leave alone create a proper case to get the required voting and decision...replycmdr2 9 hours ago

This is more or less the journey the EU has started with the Digital Markets Act, but in a very agnostic way.They identified that, among others, Apple and Google are operating a "Digital Market" of significant size within their ecosystem, where they invite others to participate and compete, and it's the role of a government to ensure fair conditions in the markets of its economy so forces can flow freely.The way they defined that is very smart. They don't define what an "app" is or an ecosystem, they identify in a objective way that their operations constitute a market, and that they have to comply to certain rules in order to ensure fair competition.I just hope that they can see this through and have those Digital Markets established as proper "markets" in the same sense as physical markets are, before some political "wind of change" is dissolving everything again.Apple is very much counting on such a wind of change, by actively rallying its users against the EU...replyakagusu 22 hours ago

My bank doesn't yet require the mobile app (quite), but all interactions are significantly more annoying without the app. My 2FA options all require a phone, either for the insecure method of texting me the code, or else an app-only option (they don't allow generic 2FA apps, but instead require a specific app, that almost definitely won't exist for a linux phone). Even verifying my identity on the phone is better with the app (the app generates a code that they just accept, it can be done without but it's slower and more inconvenient).So no, my everyday interactions don't require the phone app. But any interaction that is novel enough to require direct communication with the bank has been rendered annoying without the phone app.I'm someone for whom I'd probably be willing to deal with all these inconveniences to make my statement about ownership over my hardware and software, but I doubt that very many average consumers would.replyfian 21 hours ago

So continue to use a physical licence instead. Most are credit card size so they're not inconvenient to carry.At present, governments and banks are freeloaders piggybacking on the popularity of the smartphone. If these entities end up mandating access to their services via this route (or making them nigh on impossible to access by other more traditional means) then users should demand they be issued with phones specifically for the purpose, as owning a phone is not prerequisite or mandated requirement to live in society—although if trends continue it likely will be.Moreover, as phone technology easily lends itself to location tracking any mandatory requirement for phone vehicle licences would soon lead to mandatory location tracking (and easy to implement and impossible to disable with government/bank-issued phones).That's the logical endgame, and it'd be showdown time. The question is does the citizenry have the guts and resilience to resist such authoritarian impositions.Frankly, I'm horrified at how easily users of these essential services have been bought off by online conveniences, they've not only become careless and blasé but by default they've also conceded to the withdrawing—and in many cases—actual withdrawal of traditional services in favour of ones that both governments and banks have more control over—and in the bargain they've chucked privacy to the wind.replytype0 12 hours ago

A lot of major banks worldwide have apps, and they usually require un-rooted phones.People here seem to think this is some sort of Orwellian attempt to control them, but the reasons are more mundane and technical - many of them (mine included, from two countries) use security facilities on the phone to secure your accounts.For example, my HSBC UK app has replaced the little calculator thing they used to ship, and uses iOS face recognition to secure the generation of log-on codes which you need in order to use the web interface, as well as for secure access to the banking app directly.With a rooted phone they don't have the guarantees that these aren't being exfiltrated, or the app being subverted in novel ways, so they don't want to support it.You may not consider this a good enough reason, and I have heard it said on HN that 'the banks shouldn't get to control what I do on my computing device!', and that attitude is absolutely fine, but then you'll most likely end up with either less secure banking (meaning more fraud, higher fees etc) or going back to having to have a dedicated security device.> I can deposit checks through it on my laptopAmerican-like banking detected... who uses checks in 2025?!

I'm sure it's not insurmountable or unthinkable to do similar on phones. At the least there would need to be a system of remote attestation for the biometric hardware, and a way for it to provide a verifiable response to a remote server. Far from insurmountable, but someone will need to actually do it.Goes against FOSS still though if there are processors in the system which can't be user-controlled, and biometric chips which perform remote attestation (see the recent discussions on how passkeys are fundamentally OSS-hostile).replyyosito 20 hours ago

If iOS rebased to Linux, I still would never consider touching it.My opinion is that people actually want the political protection offered by the GPL and the people and projects who stick to it, like Debian (and others.) They do not acknowledge this to themselves. They usually want to be able to layer a few proprietary toys on top, but those are visitors who will be ejected for bad behavior, and they want an OS that will rat on that bad behavior when it sees it.

What's the hardest part about an open phone? Cellular support? App support?Maybe I'm unique, but nowadays 99% of my phone time is spent in a browser. If anything, it seems easier now to get something like this going because all you'd need is a bare bones UI and a good web browser.Sure, it's not competitive with a Samsung foldable, but he I've gotta start somewhere...I do sort of wonder if an x86-based phone is at all a reasonable prospect. It seems a bit weird to go backwards but at least they've sorted out the generally open ecosystem part XD. Power consumption is 99% about the software anyway.replyraxxorraxor 13 hours ago
| parent | next [–]
I almost exclusively use the browser as well. I think the reason for that is simply because the software landscape is that bad. I hate the Playstore or Apple Store with a burning passion. They are all adware/malware nightmares that aren't worth the effort, never mind developing for them.We have really interesting and good hardware, but it is all moot because the software landscape is plain hell. I really puts me off to ever use a Apple or Google platform.I would immediately jump to x86 regardless of power consumption. Would probably still run better than my current phone with a sizeable battery because 95% of CPU time is crappy routine you didn't even want running, so that is a software problem as well.With the power usage of screens, I doubt an x86 processor would be noticeably worse.Sorry for the rant, but I don't understand how anyone could react differently if they hear the word Android or iOS.

A couple of last years were quite impressive in how mobile linux improved.Still, people claim:
- open-source phones are low-end devices - but we (also) write our DTS for phones like Xiaomi, Samsung, OnePlus, etc. Personally, I've written dts for my Xiaomi 12 lite and packaged postmarketOS for it. for devices like Fairphone - there's already a good level of support in mainline
- mobile linux is slow and laggy - this comes from the 1st point. modern smartphones works quite smooth, and mine xiaomi phone running on sm7250 (mid level soc from qcom) feels very snappy. hell, even desktop browsers works quite good on more or less modern phones (chromium is especially smooth)
- UI is trash - please check out gnome-mobile. it's an impressive piece of work and feels very much like modern mobile UIs
- my bank/government/etc forces me to use ios/android app - we have waydroid! so, you can run any android app from your launcher (which will be running inside a container with lineageos). the integration might not be super complete right now, although it closes the gap for me.Of course, there are many gaps (like camera works on very few devices and photo/video quality cannot be compared to android; some apps are still not adaptive) but many enthusiasts continue to improve on all the directions. Kudos to all of them!

Like many, I am using an Android/IPhone - and have installed various applications. Will any/most of these exist if/when I move over to a proper GNU/Linux phone?This is the biggest hurdle.

The mobile app ecosystem has outgrown it's original purpose to run software in a constrained env. Phones today are more powerful than my engineering laptop in university 15 years ago. The app ecosystem appeal today is reach, platform lock-in, and great APIs.For example. I _want_ to run Linux phones even without all the apps & convenience, except Signal messenger. I am unable to use Signal without first registering through a mobile app. I suspect the desktop version will run fine-ish (proton after all). But at the end of the day, adoption will increase if mobile apps had a compatible desktop version on a Linux phone.replydebo_ 21 hours ago

Manufacturers can prevent you from unlocking bootloader. Whether they are Apple or not.

Total agreement with the article's conclusions. I'm an Android developer who once had about six apps listed in the Play Store. But as time passed, maintenance became more and more baroque, and a simple Android version change required me to rewrite all my apps or lose my listings. Like many developers, I gave up.Then Google announced a decision to disallow sideloading (not clear when this will take effect) and many tablet/cellphone manufacturers intend to disallow bootloader unlocking. If all this happens, it basically closes the Android platform to anything but "official" software releases.Consider this from my perspective. My first computer was an Apple II in the late 1970s. I could do anything I wanted with it, and I did. But over the decades I've watched the world of software development -- with the exception of personally owned Linux machines -- gradually turn into a walled garden.What can I say -- it sucks the joy out of programming.replyj45 18 hours ago

Forking Android is easy, making your fork a viable alternative is almost impossible.In theory the EU could throw its weight around and demand that Google & OEMs work with 'EUdroid' if they want to sell phones in Europe.

Mao said "Let a thousand flowers bloom, a hundred schools of thought contend".
Then he killed off all those naive ones who stepped out.This is more or less the capitalist/liberalist/colonial/MAGA model from time immemorial: preach "freedom" to put yourself in a indispensable place.
Then impose fascism with long-suspected hierarchies.replybeebmam 17 hours ago

rather than campaigning for open phones, i think we need to actively campaign against the requirements for phones in society.like, get some laws passed that say "if you require a phone number from someone, that's discriminatory/illegal".this way we can remove the carriers, remove the population-wide location tracking, and ensure systems such as public transit, government interfaces, finance, etc. are still accessible.reply6510 20 hours ago

Here is an idea I thought long and hard about for the last 3 seconds....Say one, rather than making the entire phone modular, adds just one cartridge slot. Have it span the bottom half of the back of the phone and be a few mm deep. Cartridges can have 4 form factors. 1) flush with the back of the phone. 2) stick out from the back. 3) increase thickness of the entire phone. Or 4) like 3 but comes with the same slot as the phone so that one can stack cartridges.The first base phone should be functional by it self but have really low specs. A slow cpu, little memory, little storage, small battery. It may even run on android and have a ton of preloaded apps no one wants. Ideally the most expensive component should be the cartridge connector.And then, here it comes, you've already guessed it! The entire linux computer goes on the cartridge.Have a similar dock that turns the cartridge into a desktop computer and a dock that connects it to your PC.Software development would be glorious.In the initial demo it should run Windows! This will send a strong signal to other otherwise uninterested parties that this is a real computer... finally...While official builds should probably exist let other vendors go wild building their own proprietary closed source cartridges.There should be infinite possibilities. People will make things we cant imagine. Stuff we will never see on flagship phones because 99% doesn't need it.Some might simply but badly want usb ports.Stupid example: I have a digital camera, I have to plug it into a computer and do all kinds of things before they may appear on my server, like booting the machine, opening apps and figuring out where the hell folders are. The pictures are great but not that much better than my phone which can conveniently send them places. But what I really need is to just plug in the camera and have the technology figure out which are the new images and upload them. It should require zero screen time.The next guy might want an ethernet port, hdmi, serial, scan barcodes by pressing a real button that also unlocks and opens the correct app. You might even have a bulky cartridge that prints receipts. A large antenna and/or a week worth of battery. I'm not at all sure if people want it but a cassette player would be possible. A boom box with atx drive bays. etc etcThen when you buy the next generation or are bored playing with it, the screen is cracked and the battery is worn out you turn it into a security camera that works when the power is cut and can send [picture] sms, make phone calls and play threatening messages to intruders.replyjauntywundrkind 21 hours ago

I fully think an amazing consumer-targetting device could take over like a storm if done well, if ambitiously done, with an aggressive software stack.But. I think what we should ask for now should be simpler. Let this be an alpha geek toy, let folks fiddle with some basic devices boards that can do the thing. The work on PinePhone, Mobian, others is good pioneering work, alas largely held back by there just being so few decent devices for folks to play with. The driver situation keeps making hope here impossible.It's not a high hope, but Qualcomm has a QCM6490 chip is maybe a rare hope. A chip that is somewhat buyable by regular makers, an extended life version of the Snapdragon 778G. It's pretty modern, and comes with very featureful connectivity hardware. We're seeing variants like non-cellular Radxa Dragon Q6A in the field. Particle has a new Tachyon board you can buy with it. https://www.cnx-software.com/2024/07/31/tachyon-business-car...It's just stunningly rare alas that folks can make systems with vaguely modern cellular chips. The cores are just not available generally. Sure it's be great to have a well produced Linux phone that is super consumer acceptable with a great OS build out, a new or revived Maemo or a Jolla Sailfish: folks who can go sign the NDAs and make a consumer device but have it be Linux. But I think for this dream to really take hold, humanity needs to be afforded some possibility to have an honest shake, some chance to be a little closer to the machine than typical cellphone bargain. The lack of cellular chip availability has been so so damning to this quest. And here is one counter-example, a crack in the wall, where I see flowers and hope grow.There was some real nice moments where it seemed like maybe some Snapdragon cellphones in general we're getting Linux support to some level, in mainline, just for the base stuff. No cellular. Unclear to me but it seems like maybe those were just the very barest of beginnings; whether any peripherals at all work or whether there was even a screen is unclear. The trickle of releases also seems to have died off. FWIW though, I will note the previous Fairphone 5 does use the above QCM6490. https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-6.1-Arm-Hardwarereplyfabrice_d 18 hours ago

I had a Neo Freerunner.It was a terrible experience. I bought it with the impression that it had calls, texts etc working fine, and they were looking for developers to come along and add apps, games, whatever to round out the experience.I couldn't have been more wrong. They had about four different distros. There was the 'old' one, the 'new' one which was already scheduled for deprecation because of the new-new one in the pipeline and there was also a debian distro. Each one used an entirely different UI framework (gtk/efl/qt), and the developers seemed focused on these endless interface rewrites when the unit couldn't reliably receive a call or a text under any of them.After that I had a Nokia N900, which was a great experience. They'd nailed down the basics perfectly (as you'd expect from a much larger company) and the unit was a capable smartphone with linux under the hood and easily accessible. It's just a shame the app ecosystem never took off, and nokia flushed itself down the toilet shortly thereafter. I guess Sailfish is the successor in this space, though I liked that Maemo was debian-ish rather than rpm-ish :)I guess what I'm saying is that a linux phone doesn't have to be raw, but for god's sake make it able to take calls and send a few messages...replyOsrsNeedsf2P 18 hours ago

This might be an unpopular opinion, but I think the raise of vibe-coding can be great for Linux on the phone. The main issue the ecosystem seem to suffer from is lack of apps. Apps building is becoming way easier, especially for simple things. If the cost of making software is going to drop significantly, we might be able to finally fill in the apps gap.reply1oooqooq 12 hours ago

I have started just carrying my laptop around with me more and more.I increasingly only use my phone to make calls, text people, and take pictures of my kids. Any time I want to use the internet I default to my laptop.This started as a way for me to reduce screen time and addiction with my phone, but the second order effect is that I don't feel limited by what a phone can do. Despite the fact that our phones are more powerful than ever and can easily run desktop-grade software, phone makers/mobile overlords have decided that they need to be controlled like Fisher Price toys.My little 13" MBA lasts literally multiple days between charges with a couple hours of daily usage. A Linux laptop would work fine too.replykmeisthax 18 hours ago

What you want isn't a "linux phone", what you want is a gun to put to the developers' heads so you can scream "let me tamper with your shit".If you just want "a phone OS", AOSP is still there and worth forking. But you don't want a phone OS, you want apps. And nobody is going to write apps for an AOSP fork (see also: Fire Phone). Actually, nobody is going to write apps for anything other than Android and iOS, just in general (see also: Windows 10 Mobile). App development for two phone platforms is already enough of a pain in the ass. Furthermore, Google will absolutely be anticompetitive and de-Google your phone OS whether you want it or not.But more importantly, if you do manage to create a third platform that people actually use, you are going to immediately be inundated for requests to lock down the phones in exactly the ways you object to, because a certain subset of app developers want or need that kind of DRM. And you're not going to get those apps without a DRM story that matches Google and Apple's.Streaming apps want encryption to the monitor.Games want a kernel the user can't modify.Banks want your phone to be a credit card you can't do fraud with.Hell, when macOS got support for native iOS apps, they specifically designed it so that iOS App Store apps won't run if you modified the OS in any way. And even then, a lot of iOS app developers specifically blocked macOS usage. The phone vendors aren't selling an OS, they're selling DRM.replyZak 10 hours ago

I wonder what an alternate history where Google didn't implement remote attestation and actively made it difficult for apps to snoop on user modifications would look like.I suspect the Fire Phone is where things changed. If Amazon had iterated on it and done a good job, it might have been a competitive threat to Google's revenue model for Android; that's less likely if it won't run games and banking apps.replyTewboo 21 hours ago

Forget Linux phones for a moment, let's start with Linux PDA. As telephony part is probably the hardest to solve due to proprietary drivers and regulations, how about building tiny PDA device that does everything else except "phone stuff" - get a dumbphone for calls and SMS, maybe some will have wifi tether.

Looking at postmarketOS devices page only 20 community supported devices have "Calls" listed as "fully implemented". Clearly this is the main hurdle for true "Linux Phone". And those devices are a bit old, ranging from 2014 to 2020, and that makes them harder to obtain, also battery might be in need of replacing. And Pinephone is currently out of stock. Cannot comment about Librem 5, but its price is quite high. So, ignoring my silly idea of "PDA" - which Linux phone should I buy and how could I contribute to its success?replyfsflover 1 hour ago

> only 20 community supported devicesYou realize it's a result of reverse-engineering done by volunteers? To me it looks like a large number actually.
The main hurdle for true "Linux Phone" is the lack of free drivers and specs, such that volunteers must spend tremendous efforts to make basic things work.> which Linux phone should I buy and how could I contribute to its success?To help Linux ecosystem on mobile, you could support vendors who intentionally provide free drivers or specs and help improve the software running on their devices. AFAIK only Pinephone and Librem 5 fit here. The former is in stock from time to time.Also many users of GNU/Linux phones run Phosh developed by Purism. Helping to improve it would help the whole community.reply
