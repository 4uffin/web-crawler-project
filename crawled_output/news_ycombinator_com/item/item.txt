We now live in a world where KDE looks nicer, more professional, and more consistent than the latest macOS. I don't know how that happened, and KDE isn't even particularly nice looking, but here we are.For many years now KDE has focused on polish, bug fixing and "nice-to-have" improvements rather than major redesigns, and it paid off.replyGuB-42 10 hours ago

KDE is, as its name implies, a desktop environment. And it hasn't been "infected" by the "mobile" virus.I often wondered why desktop UIs became so terrible somewhere in the 2010s and I don't want to attribute it to laziness, greed, etc... People have been lazy and greedy since people existed, there must have been something else. And I think that mobile is the answer.UI designers are facing a really hard problem, if not impossible. Most apps nowadays have desktop and mobile variants, and you want some consistency, as you don't want users to relearn everything when switching variants. But mobile platforms, with their small touchscreens are completely different from desktop platforms with their large screens, keyboards and mice. So what do you do?In addition to mobile, you often need to target the browser too, so: native desktop, native mobile, browser desktop, browser mobile. And then you add commercial consideration like cost, brand identity, and the idea that if you didn't change the UI, you didn't change anything. Commercial considerations have always been a thing, but the multiplication of platforms made it worse, prompting for the idea of running everything in a browser, and having the desktop inferface just being the mobile interface with extra stuff.replybigstrat2003 9 hours ago

> But mobile platforms, with their small touchscreens are completely different from desktop platforms with their large screens, keyboards and mice. So what do you do?You keep the UIs separate. Dumbing down desktop UIs to mobile capabilities is just as bad of a design as it was when people tried to jam a desktop UI into mobile. You have to play to the strengths of the platform you are on, not limit each one based on the other. Yes, it's more work, but it's well worth it to have a product which is actually good.replywavemode 4 hours ago

Everyone will have different opinions on the matter. My Lenovo has a touch screen, but I hardly ever use it because I forget that it is there. Likewise, it is Wacom compatible and I was as far as picking up the stylus for it. Hardly ever use it. For the most part, I prefer to interact with computers via keyboard.Different people like interacting with computers in different ways, unfortunately, this one size fits all philosophy that permeates the tech sector creates a lot of tension because those ways of interacting are not necessarily compatible with each other.replyamatecha 6 hours ago

GNOME. You have to install an extension to get a dock at all. Almost nobody runs vanilla GNOME because it's missing basic things. They refuse to have a system tray. I don't particularly like the system tray, but that doesn't change the fact that some apps continue to run the background when you quit them by closing the window. Up until recently, you had to install a system tray extension so you could properly quit programs like Steam. Finally, the GNOME developers added functionality where you can see background apps and close them, but it's hidden behind a few clicks. A clipboard manager is another one. KDE includes it by default. GNOME? There's an extension for that. And the problem with extensions is they always break every single time GNOME is updated.replywkat4242 16 minutes ago

This generally isn't my experience with GNOME.You have to install an extension to get a dock at all.No, there's an auto-hiding dock built-in. Pressing the Super key acts like better version of Apple's Expose feature: it shows the windows you have open, auto-opens the dock, and focuses the application launcher search bar so you can just start typing and launch an app.You had to install a system tray extensionI'm sure you needed to at some point, but (as you mention), that's no longer the case: it's built in by default.clipboard managerIf you mean clipboard history... That's true. Although macOS doesn't have a built-in clipboard history viewer either, and I never particularly missed having one. There are plenty of GNOME extensions with clipboard history if you want one.Generally speaking I like GNOME much more than KDE, since GNOME's gesture support is much better than KDE's. I also personally dislike Windows-style infinitely-nesting-menu taskbars, which is what KDE uses, whereas GNOME is more macOS-like (although it has its own, IMO slightly cleaner style... And of course, it's much more modifiable than macOS).replyjorvi 24 minutes ago

They just want to mouse over the bottom of their screen and click.Same for launching an application via keyboard / doing a calculation / finding an emoji. People just want something akin to Spotlight (think uLauncher on Linux). Something lightweight that pops over and allows them to quickly do the thing, without a lot of visual clutter happening and then happening again in reverse.replyGreenWatermelon 3 hours ago

KDE does have a convergent UI framework, though. It's called Kirigami, and I think several KDE apps use it to also get a mobile version.

I think the small form factor of mobile is more relevant than touch, although touch is also a significant factor. App design is forced to change radically to be usable at all on tiny screens. Indeed, touch is a result of the tiny aspect of mobile.replypixelready 6 hours ago
| root | parent | next [–]
Mobile form factor and touch inputs are pretty inseparable, and are so different from desktop + pointer. A lot of subtle pain points get missed because people tend to focus on one over the other. So many desktop patterns rely on hover interactions. Touch targets need to be big enough for beefy fingers (which will then cover the thing being touched). Gesture is considered normal on touch devices but not pointer ones. Reading distance differences between mobile devices and desktop ones impacts typography. And that’s just a few basic UX concerns all before you get into the weeds of WCAG and other accessibility standards.TL;DR - your designer needs a hugreplydismalaf 9 hours ago

I assume they're referring to Gnome.
Despite primarily being aimed at desktop users, it's got hamburger menus everywhere[1], and a design that constantly makes trade-offs that benefit a touch-screen at the expense of keyboard-and-mouse users.[1] Hamburger menus are designed to make efficient use of a small vertical display where horizontal screen space is a limited commodity, which just is not the case at all for a large horizontal computer monitor.
On a large horizontal display, they're a straight downgrade since you need to click the menu to see what's inside it, which makes action discovery harder.
This click is also added to a lot of actions so they add more friction to almost all interactions.replyniam 9 hours ago
| root | parent | next [–]
I must admit I don't understand this critique. I barely use a pointing device at all to navigate Gnome—mice included.Supposing I did, the only hamburger menus I can think of contain lesser-important functions of each app, like seeing the version/build number, or certain settings. I'm not sure I want something like a "See hidden files" ticker occupying screen real estate forever when I could just set it once in an accessory menu.I question whether these critiques would evaporate if, instead of the three horizontal bars, Gnome instead used a gear icon or something, and turned their contents into a pop-up window rather than a popover element.replymarginalia_nu 8 hours ago
| root | parent | next [–]
Traditionally you'd put that in a menu still, just a horizontal one that displays the top version of the hierarchy.
This allows you to skip one click, and doesn't significantly eat into the ample screen space.Perhaps the biggest problem with the hamburger menu is that there is absolutely zero convention for what you put in there, or in which order.
You don't know what you'll find in the menu unless you click it.
With the old top menu, there were a set of conventions for this; roughly where specific options went, and in which order, and even which hotkeys you'd press to activate the menus.
This means that even in an application you were completely unfamiliar with (even hideously complex ones such as an IDE or 3d modelling software), you could fairly easily navigate the application.replytadfisher 5 hours ago

I like the hamburger menus, because they are usually one-level deep and contain very few items.I cannot tell you how many times I want to go into an app's settings, and it takes longer than 20 seconds; some have it in File, some in Edit, others in random menus like "Tools". Further still, the damned menu item itself could be named Settings, Preferences, Options, whatever. Even further, looking at Gimp here, Preferences is one of 25 menu items that I need to scan through. This is not good UX, this is Stockholm Syndrome.Contrast with Gnome apps: Hamburger -> Preferences, invariably, never takes longer than three seconds to find it.replypndy 4 hours ago

Hamburger menu is a good solution for simple and small desktop apps but it's not a good choice to use it for anything complex.There's this Pinta image editor that since its initial release offered standard menus - for years it looked nearly identical to Paint.NET on which is partially based. In January devs switched to GTK4/libadwaita; new 3.0 release replaced menus with combined hamburger menu which of course cannot be decoupled in any way and which make advanced editing annoying. There's more clicking to do anything unless you decide to learn all shortcuts. And this "learn shortcuts" is quite common answer to hamburger menu complains.replytadfisher 3 hours ago
| root | parent | next [–]
I just installed Pinta to check it out. That implementation is just bad, you are not supposed to just migrate your menu bar into submenus under the hamburger menu.If I were to assist with their design, I would eliminate everything that already has a headerbar icon or an on-screen affordance; so most of Files, Edit, View, and Layers is taken care of.The stuff that remains:- Quit: superfluous, not present in Gnome apps- View: borrow the Ephiphany (gnome-web) zoom controls, move Grid, Show/Hide, and Ruler units into a preferences dialog- Add-ins: Move to a preferences dialog- Window is useless, they have tabs- Help can staySo no surprise that the laziest implementation of a hamburger menu is not good.replypndy 3 hours ago

It's kinda funny how Pinta changed while Paint.NET remains same with just minor tweaks to the interface. Luckily devs there never considered utilizing ribbon interface...In the end I swapped from Pinta to Gimp and Krita because I couldn't stand that interfacereplydismalaf 2 hours ago

While Pinta uses (and abuses) GTK4, it has nothing to do with Gnome.Inkscape is also a GTK app that follows Gnome guidelines, and every menu and tool is out in the open.

> Supposing I did, the only hamburger menus I can think of contain lesser-important functions of each appgEdit places almost everything in the hamburger menu; opening and saving files have dedicated buttons but for example find/replace is behind the burger, as is "save as". It may not matter much if you use keyboard shortcuts (ctrl+f is pretty common for find and I never try to look for it in the menu) but one might still expect a GUI to allow its features to be easily accessed without the use of a keyboard. I don't think the mix of a few dedicated buttons and a single hamburger menu is necessarily good for discoverability either.The Image Viewer puts file management and image rotating in the hamburger menu. Oddly enough, other image editing options are available in a separate editing mode that's accessed via its own dedicated button. Also, although file management features are behind the hamburger menu, for some reason image properties are behind a dedicated button.In both cases the only reason the hamburger menus aren't more populated is because there just isn't that much functionality in either app to begin with.Evince (the document viewer) also puts almost everything in the hamburger menu -- although in that case, if a traditional menu bar were used instead of the hamburger, most of its functions would probably only be split between "file" and "view" menus or something along those lines.I'm not sure if those apps are still Gnome defaults but they're some of the examples of what I'd consider somewhat poorly considered use of the hamburger menu.Outside of Gnome, the new UI in JetBrains IDEs has switched to hiding typical menu bar menus behind a hamburger menu button. I honestly don't understand that decision at all: the menus are still the same, they just require an additional click to access, and since the selection of available menus is only revealed after clicking the button, you can only start scanning for the menu you're looking for after the reveal. While separate from free software desktop design, the new UI in those IDEs is another example of what I would also consider mobile-influenced degradation of desktop UIs -- and a particularly weird one at that.replyeverdrive 9 hours ago

They are for rarely-used actions. The corollary is that frequently-used actions are surfaced directly in the header bar instead of buried in menus. This is almost universally good. I say "almost" because content creation applications have so many actions that a menu bar sometimes makes sense; I'm thinking in particular of Inkscape with three sides of the window occupied by icons and a bizarre hamburger icon in the bottom of the right panel for some reason.replyfluidcruft 7 hours ago

The GGP's comparison was KDE vs. macOS, so that's the most charitable interpretation I can think of.The comparison also holds. With every major release macOS has become more like iOS and iPadOS much more so than iOS and iPadOS have become like macOS.It's a shift I loathe, but Apple has a much harder time selling Macs to iDevice owners than the other way around. It's an understandable and maybe even unavoidable shift for Apple to make, much as it will drive a small number of die-hards elsewhere.replyfl0ki 5 hours ago

As someone who does not use Stage Manager, I don't find that the other ways macOS has become more like iOS were, to me, bad ways. The most notable changes I find were that the Settings app became far more organized and consistent, and the Control Center has tons of convenient shortcuts with a very high level of customization.In fact, Control Center is currently less customizable than iOS because you've been able to fully rearrange the controls on iOS for an entire year now. If anything, it could stand to be more like iOS in that regard, though it's not a huge deal either way.I don't particularly use widgets much either, but I never felt their inclusion was a net negative, they're just not as useful as other interfaces already available on macOS.One thing I'll definitely cede though: having some "macOS" apps actually be iOS apps, like Home, is weird not just because the UI design is unusual but also because there's been no attempt to make standard desktop hotkeys work, not even Esc.replychipotle_coyote 40 minutes ago

Let me assure you, a bad designer is going to do a bad job whether you give them a desktop-first framework or not, that's the kind of desktop interfaces you might be thinking of. But a mobile-first framework will always render poor results on desktop, regardless (and in spite) of the skill and knowledge of the designer.I cannot say this based on evidence, but I'll say anyways based on subjective common sense, that the Start Menu of Windows 95, 98, XP, and 7 were all immensely better than the Start ..."screen" thing of Windows 8.replydistances 10 hours ago

KDE usability really started improving when the Visual Design Group was launched during the KDE 5 cycle, spearheaded by Jens Reuterberg. There was a real cool atmosphere of designer-developer cooperation which quickly led to very sleek results that persist to this day.VDG tackled (and tackles) not only design for the desktop itself, but also for KDE applications that had never seen a designer's touch before.I've been long a KDE user, even through the 4.0 troubles, but also the first to admit that it used to look clunky.

I hide all UI and use only the context menu, 90% of the time to open a new tab, 5% of the time to split a tab, and 4% of the time to bring up the config dialog.
1% to open a new window, though I'm often doing Ctrl+Alt+T for that recently.This is what I've done since SGI 4DWM Terminal (and ancient NT Command Prompt), and almost all other terminal emulators can be configured to do so.
Konsole stands alone (to my knowledge) in its insistence on cruft all over the interface.
The terminal widget itself seems fine.To be clear, I don't mind obscure options, but they should live in the control panel.

All these things have keyboard shortcuts If the context menu bothers you, it would seem worth it to use them for frequent actions. CTRL+Shift+T opens a new tab for instance. It's way more efficient anyway in an app that's so keyboard centric.I don't find that context menu so bad to be honest. If you use it often you should know where things are anyway.Overall I'm quite surprised at the hate Konsole receives in this HN thread. Removing the toolbars is two clicks away and only needs to be done once. Even the menu bar can be hidden. Such a konsole window would be just the terminal, no cruft, no UI elements. To me we are in the "some people will never be happy for no clear reasons" territory.I've been using it for years I'm very happy with it. Its search feature is awesome, and its ability to have infinite scroll history is very nice too, it has decent performance.The one terrible thing I have seen about konsole is that the toolbar buttons were highjacking the keyboard bindings in the terminal, but it was a bug, I think this is now fixed and a workaround was to remove the toolbar.replymixmastamyk 3 hours ago

- Four, no really four ways to copy...- Change encoding?
I have never changed the encoding of my terminal, not once since first using a computer, circa 1982.
UTF8-FTW.- Adjust scrollback, on the context menu?- If you hide the toolbar/menu I believe it adds the main menu to the context menu.
And that is where the majority of the hundred options live.
And at the end, where a Properties or Preferences entry should live.- Last but not least, no "New Tab" entry, which is the thing I use it for 90% of the time.replyweaksauce 6 hours ago

double click the tab area and you get a new tab. ctrl-n gets you a new tab. i personally wouldn't ever use that feature.I like the extra modes of copying since they all have unique uses and prevent editing in cases.the encoding bit is odd yeah. adjust scrollback is not a common option i suppose.it would be nice to configure the right click menu more but that's not an option i see in many apps so it's a wash.

I'm not sure usability is moving in the right direction with KDE. Over the past years, more and more applications started to hide menus by default, sometimes adding hamburger menus instead.There is also a "new way" (I believe QtQuick-based) for applications to create popups, which results in them not being separate windows anymore. System Settings makes prominent use of them for example and those popups just behave entirely different than one is used to. As far as I know it's not even possible to navigate these popups with the keyboard.replytopspin 7 hours ago

> For many years now KDE has focused on polish, bug fixing and "nice-to-have" improvements rather than major redesigns, and it paid off.It has.
I believe this is a consequence of the 4.x debacle 18 years ago.
KDE was doing great in the 3.x release, capturing a lot of users, and then everything went sideways with 4.x.They recovered: by the later releases of 4.x most of the problems were fixed and 4.x was entirely livable.
The KDE developers learned a hard lesson and have been very conservative since then.
Since the release of Plasma (5.x) in 2014, KDE hasn't self-inflicted any great regressions or misfeatures, and now there is 10+ years of "polish."It is very nice.I too have used the "Window Rules" mentioned in the blog post.

I love KDE too. I think macOS was never meant to be like that though. macOS is about opinionated design, where there's one way to do things and you have to go with the designers workflow philosophy or get frustrated. Gnome is a clear example too. The developers are always fighting users that want new configuration options.KDE is all about configurability. Changing things to the way you want them to be. It's got lots and lots of options.I was on macOS was daily driver for a long time. When I moved to it I was pretty aligned with Apple's workflow ideas and Linux desktops were messy crap (KDE 3 and 4 for example). But Apple changed their design over time and started rubbing me the wrong way more and more. Eventually I rediscovered KDE (5) and it was amazing to have my computer work the way I want it again.replyeverdrive 10 hours ago

Major changes aren't even _desirable_ in UI. People kind of emotionally enjoy novelty, however when it actually comes to using a computer consistency is superior to absolute excellence.

Any organization that doesn't have backpressure against UX breaking changes is vulnerable to this.The root cause is that UX folks almost never use a product as often as their users.So what's an "oh, left instead of right" minor change for them is anathema to someone with muscle memory.Ergo, IMHO, all breaking UX changes should be required to clear a high bar, with the default being status quo + tweaks.replyeverdrive 8 hours ago

I think it's perplexing that UX has generally gotten worse subsequent to multiple developments which you might expect would make UX better:
- We now have a plethora of UX logging and can see real time where users struggle.
- There are dedicated UX teams whose sole focus is to improve UX.
- More people are using technology than ever, and so we have a more representative sample of data to work with.
But despite this, UIs have consistently gotten worse over the past 10-20 years. I think there are a few possible culrpits.
- Mimicking mobile UIs, as eloquently called out here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45290812
- I suspect there is something of a race to the bottom WRT To UX teams; they're always designing around any pain point, which has a few knock-on effects:
- There will _always_ be pain points, and so there will _always_ need to be UI changes.
- Designing a product so that the bottom of the bell curve can use it well probably does make an objectively worse product.
- There's nothing wrong with needing to learn a UI, and this "learning" could be mistaken as pain point.
- UX teams can't exist if there aren't things to constantly change, which increases the UI churn.

Put a potential user in front of the product, let them use it while the UX team observed.
Ask questions to the user afterwards.
Make changes, repeat.But that kind of research is expensive, so it's thrown out to instead just collect tons of metrics that likely don't tell a whole story.
They think "Users must love feature X because they keep clicking on it!" when the reality is that they're trying to find something else, but the label for X looks related to what they want.I agree with all your points regarding the race to the bottom.
I think that's why UIs hide so much information.

Is this always the case?I prefer what Windows 11 has done with settings being a simple two panel window with categories on left and scrollable settings on the right, with a search/filter bar at top. As you drill deeper you have a breadcrumb at top allowing you to see the levels you are in and click to go back up. This also allows space for descriptions of what each setting does. It could even be improved by allowing users to pin commonly used settings.This seems overall more simple and cohesive compared to the old Windows control panel with icons and nested settings being popups within popups within popups. It also allows easier scaling and viewing depending on DPI, screen size, resolution, etc.replynaasking 6 hours ago

As a developer who has worked on similar things, that interface can prevent a lot of trouble of the kind "What if the user edits a setting that updates something in another part of settings, which might also be open at the same time?" - or even the same settings screen opened multiple times.

To folks using Asahi Linux:I looked at some Asahi Linux videos and it always shows KDE and the interface is Windows like (or what I call Windows like). I never liked that and that is single biggest reason I never tried KDE. I know it's Linux and KDE and GNOME can pretty much made to look like each other (i.e their default look and feel). Is it trivial on Asahi Linux or needs a lot of tweaking?Something like what ElementaryOS would look like - look/feel/UX wise ElementaryOS has been my gold standard sine it released and the last I checked it still felt that way. But since anything other than what Asahi Linux installs and support by default, i.e. Fedora Remix, is neither recommended nor fares well on Mac so I don't think I can use ElementaryOS (which is essentially Ubuntu LTS) really. Even Asahi Linux team recommends KDE.Also - can one access certain Mac folders in Asahi (e.g. ~/Pictures)?

Well, once installed, Fedora Asahi is just standard Fedora ARM with some drivers and bootloader code. You can do anything you would do with a Fedora.> (I have been exploring/searching on Asahi and I am gearing up to use it on my M1 MacBook Pro - will be using/trying Linux desktop after more than a decade)If you are still hesitating, it's actually really easy to try : just run the command on the Asahi website and follow the instructions. The setup will resize your partition automatically and will not touch anything of your macOS install or your data. It's even easier than on PC where you have to boot the installation media and manage the partitionning yourself. IIRC, there isnt even the option to remove your macOS partition at any moment so you can't even lose your data by mistake.The only prerequisite is having free space on your disk and everything else is automatic.Also, uninstalling Asahi is as easy as going to macOS Disk Utility App, right click on the asahi partition, delete, and resize the macOS partition. After those three clicks, your Mac is now in the same state than before installing Asahi.replydreamcompiler 9 hours ago

> Also - can one access certain Mac folders in Asahi (e.g. ~/Pictures)? And is it even recommended, if it's possible (Security wise)?You cannot access any of your Mac folders in Asahi. Your Mac partitions are invisible until you reboot into MacOS.Some potential workarounds:1. Use Syncthing to sync your Pictures folder on both operating systems to an external Mac. This of course duplicates the contents of the folder on your Mac/Asahi SSD, which is wasteful.[Note: Dropbox does not work on Asahi Linux because it only barely works on x86 Linux and it has never worked on Arm Linux.]2. Use an external USB or SD drive for files you want to share. Needs to be formatted in something both OSes can read/write (e.g. not APFS).3. Use Paragon's $40 extFS which lets MacOS read and write to your Linux partition. Supposedly; I haven't tried it. This only solves half your problem: It gives MacOS access to your Linux files but not the reverse.https://www.paragon-software.com/home/extfs-mac/What's really needed is a way to mount APFS partitions from Linux, and I plan to DDG that as soon as I finish typing this...UPDATE: APFS FUSE seems to be recommended, although it only provides read access to your APFS partition.https://github.com/sgan81/apfs-fuse4. Make a brand new partition on your drive for shared files, and format it exFAT. MacOS can read/write exFAT natively and Linux can usually be made to do so, although I haven't tried it yet on Asahi. This seems to me like the most promising option if you don't want to depend on an external drive.replyanthk 8 hours ago

My suspicion is that mobile vs desktop is to the most part a divide that aligns with a divide between consumer and producer. And treating customers as consumers allows you to turn general purpose computers into narrow purpose ones, where you can milk the customer for every little thing that allows them to do what they want. While this sucks from the perspective of the user, it is very much a way to grow a revenue when you are selling an Operating System as part of your products.I don't say you can't produce things on smart phones, it is just a more restricted environment with things dumbed down, partly for reasons of target demographic, partly for reasons of screen size.And thus the rise of mobile incentivizes companies ever so slightly to make the desktop more like their mobile counterpart.In this space open source operating systems (or desktop environments) can be totally uncompromising. They don't need to nudge you into spending money/attention in places that are not in your interest. They don't bolt everything down and pretend to know better than you. In short, they treat you like an adult (producer) and not like a child (consumer).And that is refreshing.replyMangoToupe 8 hours ago

I still think macosx has a higher degree of well-thought-out consistency. Just the ability to use readline/emacs keybindings throughout every textfield boosts productivity enormously. Yes, I'm sure you can enable this via kde/qt settings, but I'm fairly certain this conflicts with the PC-like keybindings, and there is no way to shift all qt/kde apps to use super as the primary command modifier throughout the entire environment.That's just one detail, but it shows a consistent eye towards the user that feels missing from kde. It feels like they aimed for "floss version of windows usability" and stopped there.replysteve-atx-7600 4 hours ago

KDE the desktop is consistent. The problem is the applications aren't. It's completely possible to run a GNOME desktop without a single QT app, it's near impossible to use KDE without any GTK apps. And there are so, so many great libadwaita apps coming out these days. So on KDE you still end up with an inconsistent mash up of toolkits and styles.replysoraminazuki 8 hours ago
| root | parent | next [–]
That's completely backwards. KDE provides consistent styling and window controls across a wide range of toolkits. GNOME, on the other hand, is incapable of this, particularly on Wayland.It's sad because I really like the aesthetics and user experience of the GNOME desktop and its applications. However, the inconsistent user interface for non-GNOME applications is becoming a deal breaker as more of them transition to Wayland. These applications have no choice but to create their own title bars and other UI elements, resulting in a mishmash of different looks, controls, and fonts. Many of them don't even include shadows around the windows because they aren't sure if they should. As a result of all of this, many third party applications look hideous on GNOME.As much as I want to continue using GNOME, I'm increasingly drawn to KDE with each passing day due to this issue. I rely on applications like Kitty Terminal, mpv, and WINE. They all suffer from this issue on GNOME, but not on KDE. Ultimately, if I have to choose between a desktop environment and third-party applications, I will prioritize the applications. I think many others would do the same.replykelvinjps 9 hours ago

Add me to the list of people happy with KDE. I tried every desktop environment under the sun over the past fifteen years. I even wrote off KDE foolishly many years ago simply because I thought it looked gaudy.After Plasma 6 dropped, I decided to try it, and it quickly became my favorite Linux experience. Coming from GNOME, I was pleasantly surprised that many GNOME extensions I would rely on had equivalent feature functionality built into KDE (things like a Dock, Clipboard Manager, KWin Scripts, Tiling/Fancy Zones, animation configuration). I can pretty much echo everything said by the blog author here. (EDIT: Not to mention that so many of my GNOME extensions would break in between upgrades, or crash regularly, meanwhile KDE has been rock solid for me these past 9 months).I still think GNOME is slightly prettier, but KDE is infinitely more usable for me.replypndy 3 hours ago

In order to have a "regular" desktop paradigm workflow there I had to get variety of extensions to revert back or patch up doubtful design, usability decisions.The only place I was satisfied with Gnome was on laptop - there it surprisingly fit perfectly. Not the vanilla version of course because it still needed some extensions.Looking across the years, I don't know what's the big masterplan of Gnome devs but it seems it's not building a desktop environment for users but some weird convergence solution that they probably aim at corporations.

Just switched over from gnome. Overall, I'm happy.Gnome is configurable, but in a way that isn't really well integrated. It seems buggy to me, but I think it's because my preferences aren't standard.For instance, I like having my dock on the left, and I like top bar stuff to be in the dock, so the dock is the only thing that can take up screen space, and I like the dock to disappear when I'm not using it.Simple, right? Can't do it in the regular configuration. Can do part of it in tweaks, which is a separate configuration app, but then some of it requires extensions. So, that's 3 places to go toWhat's it called when hiding complexity makes it more complex?So, that gets me there, but then the dock fails to hide half the time on zoom calls. And when I unlock the screen, I can see the empty space where the top bar used to be for a quick flash before the full sized app window goes back to where I left it.So far, I don't have those issues with KDE. I don't like the annoying and krappy branding with the launcher icon and more than half the apps having a K in the name, but you can change the launcher icon and use whatever apps you want.replyrobertfw 10 hours ago

I have tried out at least 20 GNOME extensions (and kept maybe a third), and I appreciate the flexible underlying architecture to allow extensions to flourish. With extensions, the same GNOME can have Windows XP style taskbars or Mac-style docks or i3-style tiling or anything in between.Certainly it would be a more refined experience if the core developers took care of every single possible customization users could want under the sun, but at some point it's more effective to outsource that to other developers. Either that or you end up with Apple-style highly uncustomizable experience designed by a UX designer, which is not what I want.Extensions are a pragmatic choice.replymcdonje 11 hours ago

Extensibility can be nice, but the experience has a lot of friction. If you want something that isn't bog standard, you need to get or make an extension.Making one is more work than what I can do from basic configuration settings in KDE. I want to spend my time on other projects. The marketplace suffers from the same problems as most marketplaces. Plenty of unmaintained extensions. No guarantees of quality. Now I need to do research on extensions instead of just changing a configuration setting.The existence of extensions allows gnome devs to figure they don't have to support basic features because someone will make an extension for it.Extension configurations don't live in the same place as standard configurations.The experience is fragmented and has friction.replypmontra 9 hours ago

The problem is that the extension experience can be really bad. There is no extension API; instead Extensions have (almost) full access to GNOME Shell's code.This makes them incredibly powerful and flexible... but also fragile. Extensions can crash GNOME Shell/mutter. On Wayland that means your entire session goes down with GNOME Shell. Extensions can interfere with each other, and if you are an extension developer, you may need to update (or at least check) your extension every 6 months (GNOMEs release cycle).replyskydhash 10 hours ago

> Admittedly, this was maybe 5 years ago.

The screenshot in the OP article show already quite a few issues. It takes a trained eye to be able to articulate a lot of the issues.

I do share the sentiment that Gnome is often too rigid, but the design is coherent, consistent and aesthetically well articulated. I use Hyprland with mostly Gnome apps (have considered Niri too!)But I don't mean to trash KDE. Some people don't care about that padding or visual layering or whatever but do care about the extra options and features. At the end of the day, I'm just happy that we're on a platform where all these approaches have their space and people can chose and build commnities that grow tools that adapt to their own sensibilities and needs.KDE is great, Gnome is great, free software is great.

I have used essentially all of the Linux desktop environments over the course of decades and my impression is that GNOME attracts developers with a strong interest in "design" as a hobby. And apparently ones who take the whole, "Perfection is attained not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away," philosophy perhaps a little too rigidly.KDE tends towards pragmatism, discoverability, and customization over simple and flashy. The developers don't assume their users are simpletons who will get confused and run away if they encounter a checkbox they don't understand. They understand that many of their users are advanced tech-enthusiast "power users" just like themselves.replyoblio 2 hours ago

Honestly, I'm not too fond of the screenshots in the OP's article either.

E.g. check the analogous bits of Android, and also MacOS has a few things like plist editor windows and such where you're suddenly well off the consumer track and into unloved form-shaped things. It's a bit like the backrooms.But that's not meant as a defense or justification!In fact blogs like this and lists of warts often help us. If you play fly on the wall in some of our channels (e.g. the promo ones), you will also often see people doing the legwork of parsing reviews and ticketizing criticisms.

I really dislike how people present KDE and Gnome as being "clones" of Windows and MacOS. GNOME specially is so distinct (be it for good and bad reasons) that it deserves to be considered it's own thing. I can't stand MacOS with all it's Macosisms that are ingrained since it's Macintosh days. GNOME being grown for PC usages has none of these issues. Window management is also a breeze and easy to pickup rather than a byzantine mess. The only thing they really share is a nice, sparse look & feel.KDE does have a lot more similarities to Windows but saying it's a clone might put the wrong idea on peoples mind when they transition from Microsoft's system.replygempir 11 hours ago

I would recommend checking out Cosmic by System76. It's getting a beta very soon but I've been using the alpha and straight their git main for months now and it's very stable.It looks amazing and feels super snappy, I have never had such a painless Linux desktop experience.
It even has a tiling window manager functionality built-in that was enough for me to sway away from i3/sway.
But it also just works like a normal desktop that a non-technical user can use with ease.https://bsky.app/profile/system76.bsky.social/post/3lylz3cfy...replydimgl 11 hours ago

GNOME is pretty, but it’s not great when it comes to progressive disclosure – what you see is what you get; there’s no depth in which power user features can be found.macOS is nearly the opposite in this regard.

Do you have any examples where power features aren't accessible? The OP used a wifi applet as an example of exposing information. I'm not sure if this isn't as common as I think it is - but what's wrong with typing `ip` into a terminal (that's always open anyway)? It's desktop agnostic, works even without a desktop. And then there's no need for an entire applet dedicated just to wifi for the rare occasion you need to lookup your MAC address.replycosmic_cheese 10 hours ago

One small example is how holding down Option/Alt modifies behavior in various ways throughout macOS.Often it functions as a “do this for everything” modifier. So for example, option-clicking the minimize traffic light minimizes all windows from the application the window belongs to, and option-clicking a disclosure triangle in a nested list expands or contracts all child nodes.There’s tons of little things like that which might sound silly but become significant time and sanity savers after making a habit of using them.replybmicraft 3 hours ago

I honestly think so, but I'm not surprised some losers here at HN down voted my comment.There's many things to not like with Gnome, but they've got the user interface figured out. Contrast is correct both in light mode and dark mode. Readability is excellent. Margins and paddings are consistent across the board. Buttons, checkboxes and other gizmos look exactly as they should, with subtle shadows and 3D effects. Border radiuses are consistent and not to large.Icons are not great, but that's the same on all desktop environments now. OS X had great icons, but that age is over.And since they have all the important basics correct, it is trivial to fix any short comings in the UI.

I tend to prefer gnome's simplicity and its desktop metaphor, though I'm a niri guy now. But KDE is excellent. It's fast, pretty, customizable, and enjoyable to use. My gripe with it is that the sheer number of options and their constant presence in the UI does not play nicely with my gently spectrum brain. It's not even that I can't resist the urge to fiddle--I can, no problem--but that the presence of all the options causes anxiety. (There are also a few, to my eye, inelegant spacing quirks, but nothing I can't ignore.)Having said that, it's a marginal difference.

If unplugging the display cable works though. It's most likely the TV pretending to be still on.I have a LG TV C1 that behaves like that. While my computer monitors do not have this issue.The TV even has a dual personality. It doesn't appear to report the same informations via EBID when powered off vs powered on.I also have a MS Windows 10 connected to this same TV, and if I make the mistake of powering up or wake from sleep Windows before turning on the TV, then the NVIDIA GPU setup some broken resolution. And only a reboot fixes it.So my guess is it's the TV presenting itself with different EBID when off vs powered on. And also somehow presenting itself as active on the HDMI line no matter if off or on. Changing the TV inputs also doesn't tell KDE that the display was turned off.I haven't debugged any of it.

Not just the Plasma desktop, there is a lot of KDE software that works well even outside of the KDE desktop, and some of it is really excellent. I find Kate to be a criminally underrated editor for example.

One thing I'm happy with in KDE is that the main menu is still a thing. At least there is an option in many apps, such as the file manager, Dolphin, to show the menu.
Unlike Gnome which is very inconsistent about hamburger menus and open buttons, KDE just sticks to the old-fashioned menu bar.
In this it is like MacOS, (although if you don't use a Mac you mightn't be aware of the universality of the main menu, because screenshots of apps often don't include the menu)[1].[1] e.g. see the screenshots at https://zed.dev/reply0dayz 29 minutes ago

Is XFCE minimalistic? It feels to me like it's just a modern continuation of the desktops we had in the 90s and early 2000s. Instead of adding in a bunch of extra stuff and moving things around to keep people busy, they're just quietly making it a little better with every release.The only desktops I've used since 2007 are XFCE and macOS, so I guess I don't know what I might be missing from KDE or MATE.

Back when the lightweight desktops were popping up, KDE was considered pretty memory heavy.

We also did a lot of intentional action to get the resource usage down in the Plasma 5 generation and timeframe.E.g. the machine we optimized for during at least one or two Plasma dev meetings I remember was the original Pine64 Pinebook, which was a very under-powered device. We had a stack of them to hand to devs. Intentionally as a "if we can get it to fly there, it'll fly anywhere".So it's not just that we haven't gotten worse, we also did get legitimately better in later releases compared to some of our porkier ones (which also did exist).replyzamalek 10 hours ago

Even back in the day KDE pointed out that in real world use they were not as memory heavy because everything depended on the same toolkits that were shared.
Meaning your startup memory use was higher, but once you launched the applications/tools you were going to use KDE used less.

I've been a consistent XFCE user for over a decade. I think of it the same way I think of my desk - I'm not proclaiming its the best in the world, all I can tell you is that its pretty stable, clean and utilitarian, and I'm consistently productive on top of it.I'm concerned about the XFCE team's approach to Wayland, which is to say they are not making any commitments to make a stable release for it. I've already had to take my new Debian install back to X11 to get XFCE working. I know that Wayland is contentious and not developed with clear communication with many DE teams, but the drift here is concerning, and I am considering trying to find something XFCE-like with full Wayland support.replyCapsAdmin 11 hours ago

I've used kde for years, but earlier this year I decided to try xfce.My goal was to have my own setup without "bloat" I never used. So my own task manager of choice, my search bar of choice, etc.My initial impression of xfce was that it was much snappier than kde. My main gripe with xfce was the lack of wayland support.A big personal issue; while my own custom setup was ok, I still had to maintain it, and I found myself trying to make xfce like kde. So might as well use kde I guess.Another super specifc thing I missed was that its window manager didn't support defining horizontal gradients in the titlebar, so I couldn't rock a true windows classic theme. It could do vertical gradients, but that's not the same.Now I'm back to using KDE.replyheresie-dabord 11 hours ago

I’ve happily used KDE for years, but recently I switched to XFCE. My only real pain point with KDE was that the screensaver often refused to resume after the monitor turned off due to inactivity. To unlock it, I had to open a framebuffer terminal and manually kill kscreenlocker_greet before KDE would accept my password again, after a delay of ~10 seconds.XFCE isn’t as polished as KDE, and I do miss some features, like KDE’s excellent network applet that shows detailed statistics. But overall, the experience has been good, and I really appreciate how quickly I can unlock the screen after a pause.I also enjoy the wide variety of themes. KDE has plenty of impressive dark themes, but very few light ones, and most of those fail to clearly differentiate the active window’s title bar from inactive ones. XFCE does much better here.(Some people point out that XFCE doesn’t work with Wayland. That’s not an issue for me. My time with Wayland was highly frustrating, primarily due to the unreliability of keyboard layout customization. After months of struggling, I went back to Xorg and good old xmodmap.)replypjmlp 11 hours ago

Xfce was my long-term desktop until recently. I loved that it was lightweight, clean, and generally well thought-out.It has become more memory-hungry since then, losing some of its early advantage. And with the move to Gtk 3, it has adopted UI patterns that constantly get in my way. (Client-side window decorations, for example.) I worked around those changes as best I could for several minor versions, but eventually gave up the fight and switched to KDE. Turns out Plasma slimmed down a bit while Xfce was gaining weight, and it lets me turn off the bells and whistles that I don't want.I'm happy to once again have a desktop that I enjoy using.

(Even when you just want to drop a downloaded file somewhere in a directory ... why would I want to search in these circumstances??)I'm keeping an eye on XFCE and they plan to release Wayland support some time this autumn.

The main gripe I have with it is there's no sort of LxQT-meta package on ArchLinux which installs everything I actually need without a lot of fiddling. I spent a couple weeks just gradually figuring out things were missing that would make the environment a lot better. It would be nice if it just included things like oxygen icons and whatever. I understand lightweight, but they should have an "opinionated" lightweight option since I just want something that runs well on a SBC.I used to run XFCE on an arm chromebook for a few years as my daily driver.

> I don't know why so many distros use Gnome by default.There is a lot of history there.
Back in the day, Linux and the open source BSDs had a plethora of different window managers and DEs.
Everything from simple and old-fashioned MWM to the happy chaos of Enlightenment.
By the late 90's KDE emerged from among all of this as a popular, if not dominant, choice.
However, there was a serious problem.
The Qt toolkit license was not GPL compatible.
GNOME was founded, in part, as a true open source alternative to KDE.Linux got big enough that the major distros felt the need to pick a standard DE.
GNOME was solid by then, with no license issues by design, and there was a strong preference for GNOME among the open source thought leaders at the time.
KDE had actually solved its license problem by then, but there were some strong feelings about the license controversy.
So GNOME became the "standard."But not really.

My HP EliteBooks (800 g8 series, AMD and Intel) are an absolutely better experience on Linux than Windows, it's not even close. I'm thinking specifically about sleep, of all things.The other day, my 2020 845g8 (amd) laptop crapped out during sleep while on windows, but was not actually dead, since it was hot to the point that it heated a different laptop which was lying underneath (a 14" mbp, so a pretty chunky piece of metal). I had to forcefully power it off. I was under the impression that some windows or driver update had fixed this, but apparently not. This never happened on linux, ever, which is my main os for this particular machine since day one and I never turn off the laptop, only reboot it for a kernel update. The Intel one is fairly reliable on Windows, but it did crash a few times (garbled screen).Battery life on the Intel model is better under linux (around +25%). On the Amd I can't comment, since I rarely use it on windows, and basically never on battery.At the office I have a 27" 5k screen which I have to use at 200%. Windows is basically always a blurry mess for some reason, although it recognizes the correct resolution. The only way to be sure to have sharp output is by booting it up with the screen attached. Which then goes to hell when the screen shuts off (think going to the toilet). Wayland on Linux (sway / arch) just works and is always sharp.I also can basically not connect my sony bluetooth headphones when running Windows.

Indeed, Gnome jettisoned everything for a touch-based interface, but is not actually usable as one.

Even so, I kept getting crashes and instability.I remember the one that finally made me stop using KDE altogether and migrate to Gnome 3 at the time was one crash that I would get frequently with Dolphin while randomly browsing fils (that would stop once I removed all Dolphin configuration files but go back after a few weeks).replyVinnl 12 hours ago

I haven't ever really used KDE, and I'm quite sure that it's still not my desktop, but as someone who was aware of the trouble around 4.0, the view I had of the project was that those problems were long gone, and that most people using it today were pretty happy with it.So I'm not sure whether it's try that that caused a bad reputation that sticks around to this day.

We all (not just KDE) learned that users don't read those.
Worse, distro maintainers either don't read them or in their "we are on the latest" push will ignore them.
KDE was pushed out to a lot of people who shouldn't have got it.It is safe to say that many other projects have not done beta .0 releases like that because they don't want the same to happen to them - even though they really need beta testers.
Of course few projects will admit that they learned the lesson from KDE.replyaidenn0 10 hours ago

Ubuntu adopted Pulse Audio long before anyone (including Poettering) considered it stable.
IIRC the readme even said something like "The sound system that breaks your audio"I probably shouldn't complain though, since as a non-Ubuntu user, I get the benefits of all the Ubuntu users beta testing software for me.replybayindirh 11 hours ago

I learnt how to make proper bug reporting from AmaroK project, and still use the same methodology, even with projects which do not enforce any style. It makes things much easier.

This is one of the places I have found the relevant note [0].It states the following:
Some of the more obvious issues are listed below. If these issues are important to you, you should stay with KDE 3.5 (KDE 3.5.10 was released in August 2008) until KDE 4.2 is released (scheduled for release in January 2009) when most of these issues are scheduled to be resolved.
It is possible that distributions will work around some of these issues before distributing to users.
Also, IIRC, KDE developers were openly saying that releases from 4.0 to 4.2 will be buggy, and things will stabilize in 4.2 and beyond.[0]: https://community.kde.org/Schedules/Is_KDE_4.1_for_you%3Freplyvanviegen 7 hours ago

That's about 4.1. I think the developers either underestimated the amount of bugs an average user would run in to on the 4.0 release, or forgot to tell those responsible for communication about their concerns. The release caused a shit storm, hence the more careful expectation management around the 4.1 release.That being said: I've been using KDE since the 1.x days, with only a short Ubuntu Unity-intermezzo around the 4.0 release. Most of that time, it's been great!replylxe 8 hours ago

KDE has been the best overall desktop computing experience available on any platform for a few years now. Even later versions of KDE Plasma 5 smoked macOS, GNOME, and Windows.I'm sad because I am stuck with the requirement that all my computers can be accessed via remote desktop (e.g. RDP) in addition to SSH. And I also have to have 3-4 monitors per machine, so I can only use Wayland.Thus, I am stuck with GNOME on Linux, because no other desktop environment (including KDE) yet has functional remote desktop on Wayland. (Where by functional, I mean equivalent to Windows/macOS where you can log into the same session that may or may not be already running locally.)I know only 1-2% of users have my problems (^_^) but I just mention them in the hopes that KDE will keep developing krdp and make it work well enough to compete with GNOME and Windows on that axis...replytannhaeuser 2 hours ago

I have a terribly uninformed question. Ive been using i3wm ever since I learned it exists. Ive always had old machines and used to run Lubuntu, and at some point moved to i3wm. Its super fast and light which is what I care about the most.I dont feel like Im missing anything, but then again a lot of people dont know theyre missing things which they cant imagine (before cars if youd ask people what they wanted, they wouldve said faster horses, etc etc).So: What am I missing by using i3wm instead of for example Gnome or KDE? I dont care about pretty and shiny and animations. What else? Surely the whole holabalooba cant all be about pretty drawings and animations...?(Sure, I probably would be able to find out by myself by trying these things but... since my starting point is the belief that Im not missing something, why would I be looking at these things...?replydualogy 5 hours ago

I used i3 for a few years before switching to KDE 1 or 2 years ago. For me choosing a full Desktop Environment over just-a-window-manager is about getting all the basics already co-installed with it: a default file explorer, default calculator, default terminal other than xterm, especially a default network-manager GUI, a sys-tray already populated with volume / screen / power / bluetooth / mounted-devices / clipboard / clock & date, a launcher, a system-wide config GUI ... without a DE, every single one of these is a manual install (plus researching the best choices and verifying & comparing their quality live) and/or numerous configuration files in diverse places, googling their syntax / incantations ... since all this stuff is "side-show stuff" (ie not my code editor, browser, email client, office suite), I nowadays appreciate batteries-included when setting up a new machine, reducing overall time-to-code-editing. But the endless custom-tweaking back then was good fun back in its own right.

Excellent response, thank you. Ive finally understood the difference between "Desktop Environment" and "Windows Manager".Calling this stuff "side-show" very much resonates with me.

I appreciate in KDE that it's an up to date traditional desktop environment.

I can't quite promise yet that we will do this, but let's say there have been two recent developments that increase the probability by quite a lot:- X11 is nearing EOL, and once we drop support for it this will get a lot less painful to do.- If we want to switch to a virtual desktop / paging protocol that supports this we need to switch away from the current one, and it just so happens that in late 2024 a new protocol called ext-workspace made it into Wayland that is flexible enough to work for this purpose.I'd say at this point the biggest problem is designing a UX for it that makes sense and doesn't confuse the hell out of people.

Thanks to all the KDE devs for their work.Something I use a lot on xfce4 is the Alt-F11 shortcut (it toggles) that maximises a window over the bottom bar and removes the title bar.In this way, with LibreOffice or say Inkscape I get the application menus at the top and the applications controls at the bottom of the screen. No hotspots - nothing pops up.On Fedora's live KDE iso I can use the window control menu to supress the title bar on a maximised window and I can hide the bottom bar but its a faff requiring multiple steps.replylionkor 10 hours ago

Hello. What Linux distributives in your opinion have KDE as a first class desktop? With priority support for KDE, testing, driver compatibility etc.?replysho_hn 11 hours ago
| root | parent | next [–]
This will be a purely personal answer, as we don't really maintain any official list of favorites.Myself and my family are running Fedora's KDE edition. The Fedora team has a long history of working very closely with the Plasma dev team, quite actively contributes upstream, and I haven't been disappointed. I'd vouch for this one from first-hand experience!We also have a new project to produce a distro of our own in the works, called KDE Linux. That has recently had its first alpha release. It still has some real feature gaps and may not serve you well if one of the missing bits is something you require, but it's definitely worth looking into. It has a lot of next-gen ideas baked and some things we got to learn during the SteamOS effort, and think it has a place in the ecosystem.In the dev community I generally see a lot of people running KDE on Arch, Debian and openSUSE as well.replySunspark 2 minutes ago

My usage of KDE today is on the Steam Deck. I actually did take the time to set it up to look nice.I have three observations to make.1) There is a pain point in KDE involving windows on top of another fullscreen window. Specifically, the Live Captions app. This is a design problem that other OSes like Microsoft Windows doesn't suffer from. What happens is, if you leave the taskbar in place and want to have the captioner running over video and make the video fullscreen, you can't with KDE. I eventually figured out a hacky workaround in that if I turn auto-hide on for the taskbar, I can then alt-tab the Window and it'll stay on top. I did see some talk about this window behaviour. It's nuts that an accessibility feature needs the user to make the taskbar auto-hide first before it works. It would be nice if there could be a setting where it is "this window is on top of everything".2) SteamOS as having a large device-specific installed base, I think there is value in the KDE team encouraging Valve to turn KDE from a snapshot to a rolling release as Fedora has done where KDE is rolling but the rest of the distro is a snapshot. Why this matters, is because when it comes to bug reports and the like, the KDE bot basically closes them because Valve's KDE is "unsupported" because they only seem to rebase once a year or two. I know they did move to 6.2 with 3.7, but I found 3.7 buggy and thought KDE looked worse and had worse scrolling performance (maybe setting conflicts from the 5.27 version?) so I just switched back to the 3.6 version with 5.27 where everything looks right and scrolling moved smoothly. I know they changed the kwin compositor a lot in the 6.x series, and I suspect there are regressions in it, so if it isn't rolling, people are stuck with a buggy compositor? That sucks.3) Setting upgrades.. so with SteamOS, Valve was shipping the 5.2x series of KDE. Now 6.2, and the next rebase is probably going to be 6.x on Wayland instead of X11. So there's a lot of legacy cruft settings that carry on and I think they cause glitches. I always used to do clean install of Windows versions, and think it would be nice to be able to do that in KDE, but there's a lot of legacy cruft with various settings and conf files scattered in various random folders. At some point it really should be cleaned up.. one central folder for all settings.. no some settings are stored in a KDE4 folder, and others are stored in this other one KDE5 introduced, etc.Yizahi 10 hours ago

| root | parent | next [–]
KDE Neon was originally founded by devs who worked on Kubuntu previously, and some of that team has now moved on to KDE Linux.The company stuff in the background doesn't really matter.The team working on KDE Linux are motivated by addressing some structural challenges that always plagued KDE Neon from the concept of trying to graft more recent SW on top of the Ubuntu LTS base, plus some lessons learned from the SteamOS project's way of handling updates, and fully utilizing more recent Linux/systemd features.It's sufficiently different that sticking with the Neon brand and swapping it out for that userbase would have been pretty disruptive, so they felt it was better to go with a distinct identity.replya3w 12 hours ago

I think I got confused by your "release channels" bit in the original comment, because I thought you were asking for distros which ship and support the Plasma LTS release, but I guess you're asking more whether we have an LTS release?We did in fact have versions marked as LTS in the Plasma 5.x generation, but the concept never quite worked that well practice (e.g. because distros generally shipped newer versions based on user demand and didn't really adopt the LTS releases, even for their own LTS distro releases, so the benefit calculation for them was different from your expectation) and we haven't kept them for the Plasma 6.x series.

I have been a KDE user since KDE 1.x in Red Hat Linux 6.2, back in 2000, and used KDE almost exclusively for my Linux desktop since KDE 2.2. Right now using Plasma 6.4.5.In all that time, I was quite disappointed to see major distro after major distro (and even Sun Microsystems back in the day) choose GNOME over KDE/Plasma as their default desktops. How could they choose GNOME when KDE/Plasma is/was (in my very subjective opinion) way better? Go figure. Still until today, and with the exception of Steam Desktop, it's disappointing to see that Plasma is not the default/preferred desktop environment in (almost?) all major distros.So, it's really refreshing to see posts like these. I like when someone finally "gets it" and realizes the advantages and potential Plasma offers.In case you can't use Plasma, I'd recommend (in no particular order) LXQt, Cinnamon, MATE or XFCe as adequate options. But if you haven't, try Plasma, and customize it to your heart's content. More often than not, you'll end up liking it quite a bit.replydec0dedab0de 11 hours ago

I like KDE, just not the defaults which I think are horrific. I had my fair share of ricing linux in general, and have done my rounds through all kinds of window manager and desktop environments and theming engines and desktop effects.Unfortunately, what I found was once you added plugins and themes and this and that, there was too many breaking changes when considering the whole UI system. This is not really a technical fault of KDE devs themselves, but it turned into something akin to managing a node.js project. Yes I know it you use less plugins it's better, but I want both: plugins as well as pixel perfect consistency.I found similar issues in gnome, where it's even worse since the DE itself pushes tons of breaking changes. Note that I consider even a settings menu reorg as a breaking change.I finally settled on XFCE, where for years now, nothing has changed. Not even one pixel. The menus are the same, the search results come in the same order so I have muscle memory like "<text> arrowkey arrowkey enter".That's my expectation from a DE. I basically have the entire desktop byheart. And this culture seems to extend to the plugins as well, for example the various xfce4-panel plugins I use have all been pixel-perfect equal for years now. My themes and what not have never broken on me either.Windows up until 10 also had similar properties, I had a crap ton of plugins with rainmeter, 10k+ LOC AHK scripts, etc, and nothing ever broke.I also like that the shared library disease isn't that high in XFCE-land, in KDE installing something needed too many common k-* packages. I understand KDE gives a whole suite of apps so it might be necessary, but this also meant that I cannot use KDE apps even the ones I liked, on another DE without also getting... kwallet or something iirc.The thing I miss the most from KDE is wobbly windows. I would kill for that feature, but unfortunately, I don't think I would tolerate breaking changes for that feature.replyshmerl 8 hours ago

If I could get WinXP out of XFCE, I would switch to that, but my attempts have been disappointing ergonomically.

Last time I experimented with Linux desktop (maybe two years ago?) I had one silly annoyance with KDE on Fedora. I was running this on a laptop with a regular track pad. I was surprised to find out that tap to click was not enabled by default, I had to click the physical button to mimic a mouse click. Not a big deal I thought - I logged in, went to settings, and found a configuration to enable the behavior I wanted - great. However, this behavior was only enabled for my user. Every time I wanted to log in, the login screen would use the default behavior in KDE, since my user preferences weren't applied until I actually logged in, of course.I know, of course, that it's an extremely minor thing, but it felt quite representative. It also reminded me that Linux is stuck in this bygone age where it's expected for a computer to be a multi-user system, so of course they can't have a "privileged" user account other than root (and god forbid you'd think of using root as your normal every day user).replyE39M5S62 9 hours ago

I always wanted to use KDE but found a dependency hell kind of situation. I am a bit compulsive with keeping a tidy system, and with KDE there's so much that if uninstalled, drags the whole of KDE with it.Every time I give it another chance, usually on a new install, I find the same, that a bunch of applications, sometimes conflicting, cannot be removed.Mate was my favorite for many years, but it seems neglected now. Therefore I stick with xfce, which my primary complaint for is having an arbitrary, unmodifiable grid arrangement for desktop icons, which I find very irritating.I think, but can't recall with certainty, network-manager (or network-dictator) is one example of an application that can't be uninstalled without taking the whole KDE with it.Edit: at the predictable risk of being silently stoned to death as happens every time I criticize Network-Manager, which I will always despise from here to Elysium, I love wicd.
