on: Human writers have always used the em dash
Hello, felloe Linux user!That being said, fyi, most Linux distros (or at least many!) have by default the shortcut `ctrl+shift+U` then the hex value of the Unicode character.So, for example, the en dash is U+2013 and the em dash is U+2014, so you would press `ctrl+shift+U` then type in "2014" then space and it inputs it!I use it all the time! It's very useful!eek2121 1 minute ago

Funny enough, I thought this earlier about Arch Linux and it's deritives. It was mentioned on reddit that they operate on a small budget. A maintainer replied that they have very low overhead, and the first thought that popped into my mind was that most of the software I use and rely on comes from the AUR, which relies on the user to manage their own security.If engineers can't even manage their own security, why are we expecting users to do so?Liftyee 1 minute ago

I wonder if it would be possible to use e.g. an FPGA to intercept the "last-leg" MIPI signals going between a TV/monitor's control board and the physical display panel itself. Surely there can't be any DRM at that level, because there is not much more "compute" down the line?Granted, you would have to deal with whatever your display does to the raw video signal - preferable to pointing a camcorder at the display but a little worse than the original file.lucb1e 1 minute ago

I'm all for applying the principle of charity when it comes to "someone just heard of this and that was their first idea", and even with "there are maybe some responsible use cases involving driving".But the blue founders here don't fall into the first category, and they made a 2 minute ad advertising their product that doesn't fall into the second category either. Charity only stretches so far.I'm not a startup investor, but I'm quite serious when I say that ad would give me serious doubts about doing business with this founder for purely practical reasons (on top of other ethical ones). That doesn't mean the product is bad, but a business is more than a product.---HN definitely does have a dog piling problem where one issue is picked out by the community and discussed ad nauseam to exclusion of all else. To be honest between the magnitude of this issue and the fairly significant discussion downthread about other topics I'm not particularly feeling that it is a problem in this thread though.h2zizzle 2 minutes ago

as a long-time programmer, sysadmin/sre/devops is a whole different mindset and skillset. i would be neither willing nor able to do that guy's job; i don't fault him for not wanting to do mine. clearly since he keeps being paid his $200k/year he is delivering a lot more than $200k worth of stability and uptime to the company, no coding required.NedF 2 minutes ago

Not private enough for organized crime to move large sums, agreed.I don't get it. It's like saying bank transactions are private enough for all sorts of micro payments for content creators, but not private enough for organized crime to move large sums. Technically true, but...It's either private or not.BoredPositron 2 minutes ago

Notably, the report was published in 2015.As you said, the story is complicated. Even in 2015, a decade ago:> There is one other stark difference: only upper-income families realized notable gains in wealth from 1983 to 2013.During the period of analysis then, either consumption among the lower two tiers eliminated their available savings ability, or the real purchasing power over this period declined, leading to the same effect.bhy 3 minutes ago

US is the outlier. Canadian tech salaries are much higher than European, and when working remotely for a US company the compensation overlaps the US salary bands very substantially.However the ceiling in the US is so much higher that it still makes sense for many to tolerate the chaos and uncertainty of moving here for work.C-x_C-f 4 minutes ago

I was thinking more Lua/Luaua which make it trivial to restrict permissions. In general, the gaming client has access to a lot more information than it shares, so to prevent cheats from plugins, the developers have to be explicit about security boundaries.bryanhogan 4 minutes ago
