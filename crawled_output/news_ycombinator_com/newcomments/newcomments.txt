I personally think that operator overloading itself is justified, but the pervasive scope of operator overloading is bad. To me the best solution is from OCaml: all operators are regular functions (`a + b` is `(+) a b`) and default bindings can't be changed but you can import them locally, like `let (+) = my_add in ...`. OCaml also comes with a great convenience syntax where `MyOps.(a + b)` is `MyOps.(+) a b`, which scopes operator overloading in a clear and still convenient way.nickzelei 0 minutes ago

C++ has a plethora of available build and package management systems. They just aren't bundled with the compiler. IMO that is a good thing, because it keeps the compiler writers honest.fossman 0 minutes ago

I've seen a number of job posts that have a note near the end, encouraging people to apply even if they don't meet all the requirements.There's also the job posts that distinguish between hard requirements and nice-to-haves, using various language (e.g., "bonus if you...").lokar 0 minutes ago

I'm sure you can do the same with a standard install, look in ~/.config and ~/.local/sharetTarnMhrkm 2 minutes ago

I’m probably guilty of gratuitous template stuff, because it adds fun to the otherwise boring code I spend a lot of time on. But I feel like the 90% cutdowns are when someone used copy-paste instead of templates, overloads, and inheritance. I don’t think both problems happen at the same time, though, or maybe I misunderstood.shmerl 2 minutes ago

What will AMD do with Windows Vulkan driver, didn't they use amdvlk there? There was some radv on Windows experiment, it would be cool if AMD would use that.cortesoft 2 minutes ago

You're right, anything for sale has to be public, and competition is always expected.I think what surprised me wasn't just that it was copied, but the sheer number of clones that appeared in just a couple of weeks. It feels like a new dynamic where a successful niche can be replicated immediately.AdieuToLogic 3 minutes ago

Containers are not the best option for security. VMs and/or a MAC are better.nodja 4 minutes ago

on: Irssi: IRC Client in a Docker Image
For my homelab: portable state. I don't use this image specifically but I use many others.I put docker-compose files in ~/configdata/_docker/The docker-compose files always mount volumes inside the ~/configdata/ directory. So let's say irssi has a config directory to mount I'd mount it to ~/configdata/irssi/config/Then I can just run a daily backup on ~/configdata/ using duplicati or whatever differential backup tool of your choice and be able to restore application state, easily move it to another server, etc.CamperBob2 4 minutes ago

For HF, look at the technical articles by PA3WFM for the WebSDR at utwente.nl, especially this one: https://www.pa3fwm.nl/technotes/tn07.htmlTL,DR: you probably don't want a random wire for HF reception, but either an E-field whip antenna like that one, or an H-field loop which will likely be larger and more expensive.TranquilMarmot 4 minutes ago

Okay but how do I actually run it? Do I need to self-host it?"A new holistic exploration of music creation inside your browser."So it's a browser app, but not hosted on a website anywhere?I was expecting a link in the GitHub README to run the app but there was nothing.Eventually, I scrolled back up to find https://opendaw.org/ listed in the right sidebar.I was expecting a big huge "Run app" button on the main page of the website but instead there's just a picture of a fake box (?) and an FAQ that... doesn't show how to actually run the app.At the top we've got openDAW (which does _not_ run the app), Mission, Features, Ambassadors, Education, Contribute, Imprint... none of those run the app!Going back to the README, I see a tiny section about how to "Prepare, Clone, Installation, and Run" but that's as a sub-header to "And big hugs to all our supporters!" so I'm not sure it's related?Anyway, I give up, could be an interesting project though.mensetmanusman 4 minutes ago

Might as well say it since nobody else commented about it, but modem/soc vendors are huge limiting factor on longterm android support. Qualcomm maintains these updates for only a few years, basically nothing earlier than around 2020-2021 gets kernel driver or modem updates.Of course it's still up to phone manufacturer to integrate these changes, but it puts an effective security support timeline on even 3rd party ROM's like lineageos. They can cherrypick, but it's not as secure once that support ends.Apple has almost everything in-house (except until recently, modems). So they have a ton of flexibility in continuing to provide updates.tTarnMhrkm 5 minutes ago

How the hell is Nepal more peaceful than China or Bolivia? Last week the country has had extremely violent protests, with widespread vandalism and arson leading to inadvertent murder of political leaders, as well as many prison breakouts.More
