This does not appear to be particularly surprising (?).I think it is widely recognized that exercise and an active lifestyle can lower the risk of type 2 diabetes.Remembering my cannabis consumption days, being under the influence of cannabis is not exactly a state that encourages an "active lifestyle".yegle 1 minute ago

Not to mention that the locals here when referring to it while speaking English, totally translate it to "eɪʧ biː" sometimes.Other times, in the middle English sentence, the German pronunciation pops up "ˈhaː ˈbeː"Fungenshii 2 minutes ago

Hmm yeah, I decided that one counts because the new packages have (slightly) different content, although it might be the case that the changes are junk/pointless anyway.samrus 2 minutes ago

You could have said that about motor cars. That the horse industry wasnt going to give up that easy. Its all about incentivesHaving said that, deep sustainability initiatives like this require some forward thinking, and i dont see the public buying into preserving their own future when the reaction to climate protesters is eye rolling and the west and east keep throwing the hot potato of blame to each other rather than trying ti solve the problem.Ideally, the government would introduce regulations to incentivize this for entities for whome the value proposition would, in the short term, be negative. But i dont know if they'll get their act together to do that. So you might be rightnicbou 2 minutes ago

Germany is a great country to study and live in, if you pick the right area. The language barrier can be really isolating, even if you study in English.arjie 3 minutes ago

Jeremy Vine once wrote a story about Boris Johnson which I thought was the pinnacle of this. It was published on his Facebook page and I've since lost the link, so you're going to have to read it on Reddit where someone has posted the whole thing again.It is uproariously funny and very relevant.https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/c1korj/jeremy_v...It tells the tale of how the man who was going to become Prime Minister of the United Kingdom used to play the improviser and ex tempore comedian, in a practiced and automatic way.zero_bias 3 minutes ago

I just started looking at Strudel and was quite pleased to see this! I was impressed that it captured the idea of my prompt, which was fairly simple, but not too typical, I think (a brass call and response).
What would be of most interest to me is to see how you are doing this, but otherwise, something to assist in learning Strudel.
For example, take a more
complicated piece from the Strudel website and help pick it apart and put it back together.
In any case, thank you and I will continue playing with this while it's available!Ayesh 4 minutes ago

on: Which NPM package has the largest version number?
Incidentally I once ran into a mature package that had lived in the 0.0.x lane forever and treated every release as a patch, racking up a huge version number, and I had to remind the maintainer that users depending with caret ranges won't get those updates automatically. (In semver caret ranges never change the leftmost non-zero digit; in 0.0.x that digit is the patch version, so ^0.0.4 is just a hard pin to 0.0.4). There may occasionally be valid reasons to stay on 0.0.x though (e.g., @types/web).merlincorey 4 minutes ago

> For instance, YouTube will scan new content automatically and zap the channel if it says the wrong couple words more than a few times.This type of censorship is why I think decentralized video is important. But if it isn’t accessible to everyday people there will be low views and it hurts the availability of censored content.sugarpimpdorsey 5 minutes ago

OCSP is dead. We don't have that luxury anymore. By caching I meant for 12-24 hrs.Ayesh 5 minutes ago

I was a big fan of OCSP-stapling and must-staple. Both of which are slowly being discouraged; LetsEncrypt refuses to issue must-staple certificates since a few months ago, and I think they are shutting down OCSP servers, if not shut down already.The idea with OCSP-stapling is that the webserver fetches the OCSP data, caches it for TTL ~24 hours, and staples it to the HTTPS handshake. That way, the browser does not need to query the issuer's OCSP servers, avoiding both performance and privacy concerns. Revoked certificates will continue to work for up to 24 hours, but that, IMO, is within an accepted range compared to CRL that can take a lot longer.The downside is that the HTTPS handshakes now contain a bit more data, and we want to keep this as minimal as possible.singlepaynews 5 minutes ago

The UK banned single use plastic bags at major supermarkets. We all moaned about it for a few minutes, forgot our reusable bags a couple of times and then got on with it. Even the small plastic bags you put fruit or pastries in are now gone in a few super markets - initially, they replaced them with transparent paper-based windowed bags, but then I think people realised you really don't need to see inside the bag, and brown paper bags are back.152334H 6 minutes ago

So a question maybe someone can clue me in on here: while the specs on that MCU seem imminently reasonable to me (especially compared to some of the PIC12F and similar I've used in the past) the thing that feels odd is the high clock speed ARM core. Is it really that cheap and easy to drop an M0 core or ip block into an MCU? Why not more RAM and a simpler/slower core? The M0 feels grossly overkill.naruhodo 6 minutes ago

Which is interesting to me because, ironically, I use sativa strains to (very successfully) overcome ASD-related social anxiety so that I can go rock climbing in a gym. I use sedating indicas for the evening wind-down and sleep.daxfohl 6 minutes ago

> Then I watched Louis Rossmann’s video [1] about him, and that sealed it.fwiw, Louis Rossmann's employer/key supporter has disbursed grants to GrapheneOS and associated projects.> Plenty of people have asked for this feature on GitHubThe issue has been deleted, but from the archive, (assuming the "lead developer" jab is aimed at Daniel) Micay says, "This is an issue that's going to be fixed and not a reason to change this." Then goes, "Please use reactions on the top level issue instead of adding comments expressing support for a change. You're sending unnecessary emails to the project developers."As someone who maintains rather unremarkable FOSS projects, saying NO to feature requests is not at all easy in that it irks the community to no end, let alone one as large as Graphene's. Everyone is quick to reach all sorts of conclusions and pass judgements.> ... the way the lead developer responds makes it look like there are some serious unresolved mental issues at playafaik, there's 3 directors (also developers, from what I can tell) who steward GrapheneOS. Don't suppose they are all "mental"?https://www.canadacompanyregistry.com/companies/grapheneos-f...positron26 8 minutes ago
