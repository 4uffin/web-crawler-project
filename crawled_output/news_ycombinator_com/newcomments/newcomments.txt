As someone who has spent days wrestling with Python dependency hell just to get a model running, a simple cargo run feels like a dream. But I'm wondering, what was the most painful part of NOT having a framework? I'm betting my coffee money it was debugging the backpropagation logic.OtherShrezzing 0 minutes ago

on: The Startup Killer Nobody Talks About: Domain Nego...
Most startup killers are obvious: running out of money, no product market fit, founder fights. But there’s a quieter one that derails deals all the time: domain negotiations.Here’s how it happens:You’re raising your Series A. Investors love the product, but they ask: “Why don’t you own the .com?”You’re about to close an acquisition. The acquirer does due diligence and flags: “You don’t control your brand online.”You’ve built a user base on <brand>.io, only to see the .com point to a competitor, a scam site, or an owner who suddenly wants six figures.At that stage, you’re negotiating with a gun to your head. The domain owner knows your valuation. They know you can’t walk away. Prices skyrocket, and you’re stuck.Most founders think they’ll “get the .com later.” What they don’t realize: domain owners track your growth. Every press hit, every funding round, every Crunchbase update makes the name more expensive.I’ve seen startups lose M&A deals, botch funding rounds, or bleed users to typo traffic because they left this for later.This isn’t about vanity. It’s about leverage. If you don’t own your exact-match .com early, you’re negotiating from weakness at the moment when you can least afford it.That’s why I started working on BrandHunt.com, helping founders quietly acquire their brand domain before it becomes existential. Not a marketplace. Not auctions. Direct owner outreach, fair market valuations, and private deals.It’s boring compared to product. But boring infrastructure is what keeps companies alive.drivenextfunc 1 minute ago

on: PythonBPF – Writing eBPF Programs in Pure Python
Writing C for eBPF is cumbersome and you'd like to avoid it. Okay, that's reasonable. But I don't think it would be a good idea to write a compiler that emits eBPF binary from (a tiny subset of) Python. Why not just write code in pseudo-Python (or whatever language you're comfortable with) and have it translated by an LLM? That would be much better because there would be fewer layers and a significant reduction in runtime cost.vintermann 1 minute ago

That's true. The PCIe lanes on EPYC server CPUs are divided into the main Gen5 links on the SERDES (like I explained in the post) and the other lower speed lanes (Gen3/Gen4) come from the Bonus links. It is shown on the figures in the post. These Bonus links are often used for devices with lower bandwidth, like BMC. This is also true for Gigabyte MZ33-AR1, so the NVMe M.2 disk is connected to the Bonus links working at Gen3 speeds, despite the board manual says: 1 x M.2 @Gen4 (which must be a vendor's mistake).cykros 2 minutes ago

I believe this. I also believe that it's an indirect cause.Curious how many people who use both cannabis AND amphetamines develop type 2 diabetes.I suspect it's a smaller number.Cannabis causes obesity in some, due to its impact on appetite. Do we need to draw out links to everything that we already know obesity causes and act like this is somehow interesting information?emporas 2 minutes ago

It is very procedural/object oriented. This is not considered good Rust practice. Iterators make it more functional, which is better, more succinct that is, and enums more algebraic. But it's totally fine for a thought experiment.meindnoch 2 minutes ago

Australian supermarkets have excelled at replicating this paper bag fiasco.The white plastic bags they replaced are magnitudes of order more durable and able to carry, I should test this, at a guess ten times the weight. Basically you can fill a white plastic bag with 1.25 litre water bottles to the extent no more can physically fit in the bag and it will be safe to carry and reuse 50 times.Fortunately the white plastic bags are still available online (eBay / Amazon / etc) so I just buy 50 for my own use as required and use them till they nearly fall apart then repurpose them as bin liners.They’re incredibly cheap, don’t really get dirty in an unhygienic way, can be washed if something does spill in them, and they fold up in to almost no space.chatmasta 2 minutes ago

The 250 g half-bricks are very common. It's how the foo-foo frilly butter is sold ("cultured" butter, imported French butter with 94% fat content, butter made exclusively from milk squeezed from grass-fed cows, etc) because no one is willing to pay $15.00 for a pound of butter but they'll pay $8.00 for a half pound.ChrisMarshallNY 2 minutes ago

on: A quick guide to generate one-click retro saree po...
Instagram’s “vintage portrait” trend is fun—until you’re wrestling with prompts, lighting jargon, and film emulations. AI Saree turns that into a 3-step, no-prompt flow that outputs studio-quality retro saree looks in seconds, with believable film grain, soft lighting, and era-correct color from the ’70s–’90s.Why it’s interesting
• No prompts required: Upload a clear front-facing photo, pick a style (decade, saree color, backdrop), and generate.
• Reference-guided likeness: Preserves identity while applying classic studio aesthetics.
• Print-ready: High-resolution exports with balanced contrast and color.
• Privacy & control: Download, archive, or delete your images anytime.
• Free to try: 200 free credits (about 2 high-quality generations), no watermark, no card.How to (takes a minute)
1. Upload your photo — neutral background, even light, unobstructed face.
2. Pick a retro style — choose decade, drape, and palette, or use presets inspired by the IG trend.
3. Download in HD — get social-ready or print-ready files immediately.Pro tips for authentic results
• Use window light or diffused daylight; avoid harsh overheads.
• Keep a relaxed, neutral expression for a timeless portrait vibe.
• Frame head-and-shoulders or half-body; leave room for the drape edges.
• Try two contrasting palettes (warm 70s vs. cooler 80s) and pick the keeper.tetha 3 minutes ago

Probably shouldn’t be either.More
