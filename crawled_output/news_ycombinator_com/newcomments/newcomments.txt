Japanese has (slightly) more homophones and favors monosyllabic Sino-Japanese in compound words. That makes it hard to depend entirely on phonetic script. Same reason why English retains irregular spellings to help with some disambiguation.tgwil 0 minutes ago

I would consider taking an introspective look at your company and see if you're doing anything that would cause people to view your company as evil. People have quite a fun time wasting evil companies time and resources. It's common for some random person to share a story from a company and then everyone in the group pools their resources together to hammer the company with fake applications.squigz 0 minutes ago

It happened with Schwab. I've enabled option trading in one of my accounts and got a call from Schwab, asking to authenticate me. I told them I couldn't trust it's a legit call; give me a number and case number and I'd call back.rhet0rica 2 minutes ago

on: UTF-8 is a brilliant design
Addendum: This was posted to the front page today: https://doc.cat-v.org/bell_labs/utf-8_historyIt also notes that UTF-8 protects against the dangers of NUL and '/' appearing in filenames, which would kill C strings and DOS path handling, respectively.silverwind 2 minutes ago

The auto-updating behaviour dependencies because of the `^` version prefix is the root problem.It's best to never use `^` and always specify exact version, but many maintainers apparently can't be bothered with updating their dependencies themselves so it became the default.animegolem 2 minutes ago

Can't say my experience matches yours, either. I too have a box of unsupported mobile devices; the stuff I can do on an Android device clears every iOS one. I can't install apps on iOS without a desktop and a specific unsupported iTunes client. I can only use a subset of iOS functions.My Android phones still do everything they say on the tin. Regardless, you've worded your entire argument to be orthogonal to my original point so it's clear you're not arguing in good faith. Nothing you ever said was related to the principles I mentioned, just what you consider to be personally valuable. Which is fine, but again, unrelated to the point. It's a non-sequitur.pfdietz 2 minutes ago

I appreciate you having a go and it does look very attractive. It's not a problem I have but $5 is a reasonable request for something that gets the info into an understandable format for somebody.I do think that small, single-purpose apps are probably the easiest lunch to eat. Narrowly scoped greenfield projects are where the LLMs seem to excel right now so that game seems like a race to the bottom.As far as the cloning goes: your only recourse is probably the DMCA angle for the exact duplicate text. It's a shame they're so lazy as to straight copy it, but I suspect the response (if any) will be them lightly laundering it through ChatGPT so it's no longer the same.Good luck! And I hope you find more useful ideas people might pay fordeadbabe 4 minutes ago

> It isn't feasible to audit every line of every dependency,
just as it's not possible to audit the full behavior of every employee that works at your company.Your employees are carefully vetted before hiring and there's someone you're able to hold accountable if something goes wrong. This seems more like having several random contractors who you've never met coming into your business in the middle of night. Contractors that were hired by multiple anonymous agencies you just found online somewhere with company names like z692d or 420C0der69 who you've also never even spoken to and who can't be held accountable. Agencies that can swap workers into or out of roles at your company without asking or telling you."To make thing easier for us we want your stuff to require the use of a bunch of code (much of which does things you don't actually need) that we haven't even looked at because that'd be too much work for us, oh and third parties we have no relationship with control a whole bunch of it which means that code can be changed at any moment introducing bugs and security issues we might not hear about for months/years" seems like it should be a hard sell to a client, but it's sadly the norm.Assuming that something is going to go wrong and trying to limit the inevitable damage is smart, but limiting the amount of untrustworthy code maintained by the whims of random strangers is even better. Especially when the reasons for including something that carries so much risk is to add something trivial or something you could have just written yourself in the first place.ecshafer 4 minutes ago

The first programming language that used overloaded operators I really got into was Scala, and I still love it. I love that instead of Java's x.add(y); I can overload + so that it calls .add when between two objects of type a. It of course has to be used responsibly, but it makes a lot of code really more readable.benmanns 5 minutes ago

The trouble is, you have to place the outbound call to those contacts to trust them. People could spoof an incoming call from numbers in your contacts and it will look as legitimate to you as a receiver as if the real number was calling you. With voice spoofing, it's now possible to call someone as [grandchild] with [grandchild]'s voice with a pretty horrible story about what's going to happen if some Bitcoin or Google Play gift cards are not purchased and handed over immediately.aworks 5 minutes ago

The last place I work do this by requiring an in person to "pick up your laptop" and immediately, many of fake will not bother even enter the pipeline -- and make it well known upfront you will not shipThe people that desperate for employment but legitimate will work the job are happy to take a free flight and hotel and meet some people in the team - it was full remote but had a few in major city so just fly them to a "wework" say hi to a several members free dinner and all.NK, scammer, body shop that will substitute the worker on day 1 after have someone else fake the interview don't bother in this termsChrisArchitect 5 minutes ago

The number of fake resumes is insane. During reviews I ended up passing a number of fake profiles through because their CVs looked real. None of them showed up to the initial screening call.There are now AI CVs mimicking real people, so the CVs point to real Linkedin profiles, Github profiles.Not sure what their end game is unless it's to continually test CV creation or find woefully inept companies that will hire them with limited vetting.smrtinsert 6 minutes ago
