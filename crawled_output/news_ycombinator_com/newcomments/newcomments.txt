on: Wind turbine blade transportation challenges
What is the full lifecycle plan for the turbine? Is this special airplane to land in the same dirt field that's now a housing development? Are they only pairing these megaturbines with airfields? How exactly will a new blade arrive on-site in 2050?vehementi 0 minutes ago

Once you replicate the data, you replicate the APIs and generate the sdks. Got it. But then how much work to change my front end components on the like 30 visualizations I have to actually use them? And to validate them?DaveZale 0 minutes ago

Yes but the flip side, is that we lived in Indiana for a while.
Very cheap living there.
So, keep your expenses low, with no debt.

Yeah, when I started I actually had no intention of doing a chat app, but it was a good way to learn how it works. Eventual goal with this is a sort of hybrid notes app. Not an llm bolted into Notes, either, but kind of a mix. Find myself using the llm app as a knowledge repo and it’s just not built for that. I’ll post a TestFlight link later if you want to try it out.tartoran 0 minutes ago

on: The old SF tech scene is dead. What it's morphing ...
I was there too, and that is not what I saw.My observations at the time: dotcom-1.0 was split pretty evenly between SF and SV, but there were clear differences in focus. Hardware and legacy stuff was all in SV, software/web/media was substantially all in SF.Dotcom-2.0 (social media/SaaS/etc) was entirely in SF.I'd agree that SF owned 2.0 and shared 1.0, but 1.0 in the city was extremely busy with founders, employees, launches, leases, and money.I worked up and down the peninsula. Investors and data centers (VCs and DCs) were down south -- the latter with one exception: 200 Paul Ave, although itself at the extreme southern edge of SF.Founders, staff, offices, and everything else were in the city.I worked at one company who opened an office in the valley, but we literally couldn't hire people down there (Santa Clara), and couldn't get people to move there. All the action was in SF, for a software/web/media business.yladiz 0 minutes ago

on: Bertrand Russell to Oswald Mosley (1962)
This letter makes perfect sense to me if he had sent it as his first reply to a fascist in 1946. Why did he correspond with him over 43 previous letters from 1946 and only in 1962 act as though he had principled objections to corresponding with fascists? The tone is not "this time you've gone too far", or "I have decided we're not getting anywhere", but "We have nothing in common and could never converse". I wonder if he realized it was the same guy, or was submitting this to some public forum.murderfs 0 minutes ago

That's for switching to the NF-A12x25 G2 fan (from the G1), which has a lower max RPM. The improved side panel appears to be a strict improvement.analog8374 1 minute ago

Powershell is amazing. Just don't expect it to be posix. Using objects and structured data is leagues better than string parsing in posix shells imo.authleap 1 minute ago

on: Where the Latency Hides?
Effective latency optimization in complex distributed systems hinges on a simple principle: you can’t improve what you can’t measure. Having a comprehensive, multi-layered measurement baseline that offers a granular, end-to-end view of the request path helps isolate whether delays originate at the client, the network, the CDN, the load balancer, or deep within origin services. At DevRev, we track how much latency each hop from the end user to the origin services contributes, and this allows us to consistently refine our system and deliver the best value to our customers. Today, we’ve accumulated over 10 billion latency records across different APIs, giving us unparalleled visibility into performance.By analyzing these latency datasets, we’ve uncovered patterns that aren’t always visible in small-scale tests like hidden queuing delays under burst traffic, cross-region routing inefficiencies, or subtle inconsistencies introduced by third-party dependencies. More importantly, we’ve learned that latency issues often don’t come from a single bottleneck, but from the compounded effect of several small inefficiencies across layers. In this blog, we delve into the lessons we learned while uncovering blind spots in improving end-to-end latency across DevRev API traffic.unethical_ban 1 minute ago

Download counters are completely useless. I could download your package 2 million times in under a minute and cause you to need the 2FA.And true 2FA means you can't automate publishing from github's CI. Python is going the other direction. There is a fake 2FA that is just used to generate tokens and there is a preferential channel to upload to pypi via github's CI.But in my opinion none of this helps with security. But it does help to de-anonymise the developers, which is probably what they really want to do, without caring if those developers get hacked and someone else uses their identity to do uploads.schneems 1 minute ago

on: Plugin System
A lesson learned over and over again is that you can build amazing things with tightly coupled plugins, but once you have about three of them upgrading or changing anything gets kind of impossible. On the other hand, loosely coupled out-of-process plugins are a lot less flexible, but tend to work a lot better and more reliably, at the cost of more up-front engineering and overall investment. Assuming that what they can do is sufficient to work.Consider that e.g. kubernetes has basically just one actual core component (the API server) and everything else is loosely-coupled plugins.wanderingstan 1 minute ago

It doesn't say that:> In addition to redesigning and testing the Noctua fan grill, we also evaluated various other scenarios. These included replacing the NF-A12x25 with its G2 variant and incorporating an additional 8cm fan for exhaust purposes.banku_brougham 1 minute ago
