on: Nicu's test website made with SVG (2007)
That's totally correct! I once replaced some blurry scans from the 6502 manual by SVG versions, and, while I was it, I coded them by hand (really, because for this particular job it seemed easier than doing it in a drawing program.) While nobody will notice, it's satisfactory.[1] https://www.masswerk.at/6502/6502_instruction_set.html#stackg-b-r 0 minutes ago

It would easily mean that you're required to have an unmodified device, running a locked down system, to be able to access any service that uses age verificationAlthough, a much more sensible alternative, would be to have parents (that want the control) give their sons devices that send the "minor alert" signal, and have the services detect thatverteu 0 minutes ago

It is not proven that he is a shooter, he is alleged shooter, but there are a lot of inconsistencies in the official FBI story.Plus the suspect pleaded not guilty, so let's respect his right to be innocent until proven guilty.rmunn 0 minutes ago

on: UTF-8 is a brilliant design
That is indeed why they limited it, but that was a mistake. I want to call UTF-16 a mistake all on its own, but since it predated UTF-8, I can't entirely do so. But limiting the Unicode range to only what's allowed in UTF-16 was shortsighted. They should, instead, have allowed UTF-8 to continue to address 31 bits, and if the standard grew past 21 bits, then UTF-16 would be deprecated. (Going into depth would take an essay, and at this point nobody cares about hearing it, so I'll refrain).bluGill 0 minutes ago

It seems to me that only kellogs, post (and maybe malt-o-meal?) make raisin bran, the rest are the above with a different name. I buyithe brand name anyway as quality control will sell marginal (safe to eat but batch was mixed wrong) product to the other labels they won't to themselves. (these days i make my own meals from scratch, when I used to I bought the brand after getting burned on generics)Lerc 0 minutes ago

on: Titania Programming Language
Having done a fair degree of programming in Wirthwhile languages,
I think the only main design decision that I think was a mistake was the variables at the top.I'm not sure of the value of seeing all of the variables used listed in one place,
it has certainly led to me encountering a identifier scrolling up to determine the type then scrolling back down.
When the variable is only used on a few consecutive lines it's just adding work to read and adding work to create.
I daresay I have written harder to read code than I intended because I didn't want to go up and declare another variable for short term use.
The temptation to inline the expression is always there, because you know what all the parts mean when you write it.
It's only when you come back later that you get the regret.It's possible it could be mitigated by defining something like (not sure if this is a valid grammar)
stmt_sequence = {decl_sequence}. stmt {";" stmt} [";"].
and bring in scoping on statement sequences. maybe call it stmt_block so that stmt_sequence can be a component that really is just a sequence of statements.bruce511 0 minutes ago

on: Rebutting 33 False Claims About Solar, Wind, and E...
I am not an academic, do I'll leave the formal stuff to others. However I have been running a residential dollar system for 2 years, and tracking the numbers, so here's my data for what it's worth.Firstly, as a return on capital spent, I'm seeing a return of 16% per annum. As electricity prices increase, that trends up.Secondly we're purchasing about 66% less energy annually. In summer months around 85% of daily (electrical) energy use is self-generated. Most of our annual grid consumption occurs during 2 months in winter. (We still produce then, but not enough to run our electric heating.)Next year I'm switching to an EV, which can be charged from my current excess (unused) daytime generation for approx 9 months in the year.I can't speak to grid-scale costs, but for me anyway, generation cost is 0. (Capital cost was real, but return on capital is 16% and rising, which is better than my retirement account.)So, if you want to reduce your energy costs, self production is the best route. If you can't do that, then it's unlikely that you (as the consumer) will benefit much. The supplier will likely supply at market rates (set by the most expensive source) and the gap is their profit not yours.We may in future move to a pricing model that favors cheap electricity during the day, and more expensive at night, but at least where I am that's not a thing yet.So, generally speaking, it's a lot cheaper to use electric over gasoline for transport. Electric from solar is cheaper to produce than burning fossils. Whether that translates into cheaper for you though depends on market forces. If you're in the US, we'll, good luck with that. It seems to me that suppliers in the US price based on what the consumer will pay, and less on input cost.Of course all my numbers will vary a lot based on location. YMMV.Braxton1980 1 minute ago

There's an uptick in younger conservative voters, those more likely to hold such views. I'm not sure the age out solution is working especially when, in the US, the Republican party pushes the narrative to win votes.In other words there's motion behind these viewsthrowaway422432 1 minute ago

Google doesn’t need to identify you… you use Gmail.And anyway, they created a library
(https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/opening-up-ze...) to make age verification not useful for identification but still real.So… I’m sure you meant fingerprinting but presumably porn sites already do that?AdieuToLogic 1 minute ago

This has nothing to do with actual age verification.
This is regulation to create a bigger moat against startups, and it's why all the big tech companies want this.Once the tech is in place, the next step will be to mandate it for more and more services.NathanielBaking 1 minute ago

on: You’re a slow thinker. Now what?
The thing that resonated the most with me was the idea that slow processors need to focus on strategic thinking.
I am a 60 year old and now retired software developer.
I keep myself busy by actively continuing to code every day.
I definitely have experienced a slowing of thinking in the last ten years.
I have read that this could be because I have more information to sift and sort but being honest with myself, the machinery is not as well tuned as it once was.I am fine with all this.
I love coding and I doubt I will ever stop doing it for pleasure.
I have had to become more methodical and intentional with my time on the laptop but reflecting on this piece, being more strategic would be a wise thing for me to contemplate on.j_not_j 1 minute ago

feels like something pretty straight forward to fix.It is actually not. This is something I learned as a lad working in a bakery, professional bakers use all kinds of ingredients not readily available at home. Especially in e.g. boxed cake mix, it's actually a half dozen ingredients that are totally impractical to keep on hand. Various gums, starches, dextrins, mono- and di-glycerides, surfactants, encapsulated flavors, specific leavening ratios, basically the whole chemistry set.The annoying thing is, the ingredient list says "modified food starch", but it could be any of a half a dozen different kinds of modified food starch, with different properties depending on how it's been modified and what the composition of the original starch was. Some are gelling, some are thickening, some are thinning, etc.That's also why making your own cakes trying to imitate them quickly becomes a fool's errand. You're never going to beat the chemistry that's in the box, and even if you did it would look more like molecular gastronomy than baking.thekevan 4 minutes ago
