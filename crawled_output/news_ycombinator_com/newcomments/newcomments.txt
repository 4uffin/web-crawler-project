I took a Waymo that drove on an 'expressway' which had a speed limit of 40mph and it was definitely a different feeling. I did feel a bit scared, at 25mph it feels like a gentle theme park ride, at 40mph it's beyond that and feels dangerous.OutOfHere 0 minutes ago

Why do people keep saying this? Sure interest rates were high a long time ago but right now today there are a crap load of people with low interest rate mortgages effectively trapped in their houses.When more than half of the population has a 5% or higher mortgage rate then you can start to say it’s not that high.https://calculatedrisk.substack.com/p/fhfas-national-mortgag...drivebyhooting 0 minutes ago

Well That’s certainly not been my experience when visiting Europe. In fact, it many cases it’s been the opposite - having a car would have been restrictive in any major city and a source of friction.Brendinooo 0 minutes ago

on: Will I run Boston 2026?
Your site looks interesting but your terms of service seem really onerous. That stopped me from finishing the signup process. My running data is deeply personal; it's tied to my health metrics and contains years of location patterns around my home, work, and daily life.So when I see stuff like "irrevocable, sublicensable" rights to all of my running data...that's a lot to give up for a company and product I know very little about.Capping your liability at $50 total for any harm and doing as much as you can to try and get me to lose access to legal protections such as class action and a jury trial is all a bit much.psnehanshu 0 minutes ago

Does it matter where it's developed though? Once it's good enough to expand into all major US cities they could look into deploying in Europe too.Im happy to let Americans be the beta testershypeatei 0 minutes ago

Potentially it was a different time. Google did hire Eric Schmidt whose previous company Novell was destroyed by Microsoft. Some say that NT stood for Novell or NetWare terminator.The28thDuck 1 minute ago

You're right, although I think I'd just call that sending a few emails.
Cold email marketing as a practice includes learning how to avoid spam filters and avoiding being detected, and it's unapologetically spammy.archagon 1 minute ago

…What? What kind of terminally online loser would spend his free time “virtue-signaling with Europe” to some anons on a tech forum? What a dull and intellectually uncurious reply.I think self-driving cars may eventually become common in areas where cars are currently common. I think public transit will continue to dominate in parts of the world where it currently dominates, because it is simply a superior user experience for the majority of people if the government cares to invest in it. (Not to mention far cheaper and more egalitarian.)throwawaylaptop 1 minute ago

There's a bit more to it since you do need to do last bit of configuration (pull up the nose) just as you hit the target speed. But yeah, automatic take-off is quite a bit easier than automatic rejection of take-off.koakuma-chan 1 minute ago

The first paragraph:> Since 1990, far-right extremists have committed far more ideologically motivated homicides than far-left or radical Islamist extremists, including 227 events that took more than 520 lives. In this same period, far-left extremists committed 42 ideologically motivated attacks that took 78 lives.https://www.publicnow.com/unfitted2545 1 minute ago

I think most organized and militarized western leftist groups were probably defunct by the end of the Cold war.I’d assume it’s mostly a product of who the enemy was during the Cold War. Though I understand the far right made a large shift in how decentralized they operate around the end of the 20th century too after the feds started picking a lot of various KKK and other organization members off.cmrdporcupine 2 minutes ago

on: Java 25 officially released
As others are saying, it's a culture not the language. C++ and even some Python etc written in the late 90s, 00s era has the same pattern-itis. It comes from slavish adherence to the Gang Of Four patterns books and an obsession with OO generally. Also the languages themselves were weak on non-OO abstractions and ways of doing code re-use, so for example it took forever for Java to get lambda expressions ... so people used one-off helper classes with "invoke" methods, etc.segmenta 2 minutes ago
