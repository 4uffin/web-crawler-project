You never know 'enough'. You just have broad interests and see how all things are more interlinked than any one specific branch of knowledge captures. So you naturally wander through a host of subjects rather than exclusively deepdive into a single specialization.eloisant 0 minutes ago

To be honest there was a short period where it felt fresh and cool when UI started to talk casually instead of the cold factual language.Now the novelty has wore off and we should go back to those boring computer messages.vbezhenar 0 minutes ago

on: GuitarPie: Electric Guitar Fretboard Pie Menus
This is cool, but I'm having a hard time seeing this working in a real product.Guitarists have been using their picking hand or pedal controls since the beginning of the electric guitar without much fuss or concern.I also thought pie menus died off because everyone decided they were too limited, hard to understand, and overall annoying regardless of the input method.homeonthemtn 0 minutes ago

Python and Rust both have decent std lib, but it is just a matter of time before this happens in thoae ecosystems. There is nothing unique about this specific attack that could only happen in JavaScript.fl4tul4 0 minutes ago

on: People Who Hunt Down Old TVs
I host monthly retro gaming meetups and we use CRT TVs that we store at the local library. Luckily, more than enough are still given away for free here. Right now we have around 25.They're just surprisingly good when paired with a good signal and an old gaming console. I still would love to have a professional monitor but they are too pricey for me. I also need to get myself a CRT monitor.dkrich 0 minutes ago

The introduction to a river runs through it is an interesting read. I never realized how much creative influence Redford had over the production of the movie until I read it a few months ago.tamimio 0 minutes ago

You clearly never seen police dashcam videos in the US. Besides the corruption and stops for "hunt missions", a lot of times it's simply because you shattered their ego, even with a simple laugh: https://youtube.com/watch?v=NqJdt9_1XSwmadeofpalk 0 minutes ago

It's not that hard if it's something you decide you care about and want to solve. Like diggan mentions, there's many tools, some you already might use, that can be used to inject secrets into applications that's not too onerous to use in your development workflow.toomuchtodo 1 minute ago

on: Why do we keep gravitating toward complexity?
People are like a gas, they expand to fill the space they're in. If you have simplicity, you can always just do "one more thing" until eventually you've blown past your ability to understand / maintain / control what you've built. People can't help, it, and I believe it maps directly to overeating, homes filled with junk that no one needs, debt, and many other excesses.weinzierl 1 minute ago

In Rust we have cargo vet, where we share these audits and use them in an automated fashion. Companies like Google and Mozilla contribute

How will multi-factor-authentication prevent such a supply chain issue?That is, if some attacker create some dummy trivial but convenient package and 2 years latter half the package hub depends on it somehow, the attacker will just use its legit credential to pown everyone and its dog. This is not even about stilling credentials. It’s a cultural issue with bare blind trust to use blank check without even any expiry date.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust,_but_verifytdeck 1 minute ago

If you're talking to someone who is mostly computer illiterate, you'd say something like "do you see a folder icon on the screen that says My Cases? Double click on that." and not "go to My Cases"0xcb0 1 minute ago

on: React is winning by default and slowing innovation
I switched from PHP to TS and vue some years ago.
From time to time I look into react. And I still don't get the hype.
For me, vue is the much more sane way of handling frontend development with js/ts. React looks bloated and overcomplicated to me. But maybe thats just me.potato3732842 1 minute ago

The part that should really enrage you is the way people will selectively understand this based on whether they agree or disagree with the context.If some electronics repair guy repairing vehicle ECUs in bulk who doesn't ask questions but has an inkling that they're gonna get used for emissions laws violations got rolled up on by the feds for refusing to go out of his way to help them out HN would find all sorts of ways to cheer and justify it.F3nd0 1 minute ago

>> But this should be a cautionary warning of what might also happen anyone if you associate with things that are perceived as criminal in nature.Opioid painkillers are associated with “things that are criminal in nature” because a certain segment of every society does and will suck, nearly no matter what.
Does this mean that everybody in pain should just suffer and let their education, career, and family be taken from them before their time?skaln 2 minutes ago

on: My thoughts on renting versus buying
You can't get anything through because you're simply incorrect.No, housing is not always cheaper, feel free to do some research. Its highly dependent on your city.If you truly think buying is cheaper in Manhattan then I don't know what to tell you. You're just wrong, period.What's happening here is youre comparing suboptimal housing to THE ABSOLUTE most expensive apartments you can find.My parents do the same thing. "Oh housing is so much cheaper, imagine renting in Dallas!"But... We're an hour and a half outside of the city.The reason the housing is cheap is because nobody wants it.KaiserPro 2 minutes ago

Yeah, under UNIX, the UX landscape was really bad. I think that Qt was available already, but not quite open source.More
