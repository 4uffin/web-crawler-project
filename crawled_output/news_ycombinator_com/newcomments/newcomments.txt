on: Linux phones are more important now than ever
Android doesn't even let you access your files. It has famously blocked acess to the subfolders of /Android/data/ - every app has a subfolder there where it stores files. And you can not visit these subfolders since Android 11.A buggy app accumulates gigabytes (literaly, i am not exagregating) of temp files there, but i cant visit the folder to delete them.Google explains that "it's for you safety".I have to call it with the strong word "idiotic".There are apps now where storing files in a shared, accessible folder is a payed option.Not only that is outrageous, I belive that violates the existing "right of access" laws like GDPR. I am condidering even submitting Subject Access Request to Google about my /Android/data/ subdirectories.jMyles 1 minute ago

on: Linux phones are more important now than ever
I had to use government apps as part of their immigration process, the apps were only available in the official app stores. If I remember right they had am all for immigration services, though I know for sure they had a digital ID app that was absolutely required.The major banks in that country also required apps from official app stores, though I don't think I was technically required to have a bank account. I was in the country under a program based on owning my own consulting business. I did have to prove financials to the government as part of that, but maybe there was a way I could have technically done that without a bank account which required a mobile app.cute_boi 1 minute ago

> going back to having to have a dedicated security device.... and ...?There are ways to implement security without tying it to one of two app stores. Companies might even get creative and figure out hardware standards for secure verification that are portable, open, and give the user control. They figured out sim cards, and are worried about GAI they created taking over the entire world, they could figure this out.1vuio0pswjnm7 2 minutes ago

on: Why do we keep gravitating toward complexity?
Gravitating toward complexity is admirable if the goal is to "solve" (reduce) the complexity, i.e., take something complex and make it simple(r).
Thats is, if the goal is simplifictation.
For example, making something complex easier for others to understand.
If simplying what is complex is the challenge, then gravitating toward it is worthy of admiration.What is peculiar is that software developers, the "we" in the editiorialised HN title, when commenting online, dislike the word "simple".
It's like they refuse to acknowledge the word has a defined meaning or that there is such a thing as simplicity.It is generally agreed that abstraction creates more complexity.
Abstraction might make software _easier to use_ but "easier to use" and "simple" are not necessarily the same result.
Software with more layers of abstraction is not simpler, easier to understand, than software with fewer layers of abstraction.tczMUFlmoNk 2 minutes ago

Sure. The point is, people use React for everything, even static web sites, not only for creating reactive user interfaces. They do it because someone else told them so.thaeli 2 minutes ago

FPGA based devices that can do this, and quite well, do exist, they're just expensive. The RetroTINK-4k Pro is the top of the line as of this writing but it's a $750 converter.acdha 2 minutes ago

Yes. There’s also something about the sheer volume of recorded media & ease of distribution which feels like we crossed a qualitatively different threshold. The laws around photography were set in an era when it cost money to take a photograph, the cameras were easier to notice and slower, and when someone took a photo it was highly unlikely that they’d share it widely. Now it’s basically impossible to avoid cameras, people take far more pictures than they used to, and anyone’s photos can reach large audiences and often easily linked back to you. There was nothing like the way random people could see someone having a bad day, post it, and half an hour later a million strangers have seen it - a newspaper or TV station could do that, but their staffers usually ignored things which didn’t have a legitimate news interest.This feels kind of like the way you could avoid having extensive traffic laws & control systems in 1905 when only a few people had cars.Marsymars 2 minutes ago

I agree. It's objectively nonsense with regards to AirPods and Apple Watches in particular. Both are extremely dominant in their respective categories. Objectively, Apple is not alienating its "long-time customers".But people love to rage and be enraged on the internet. So anyone pointing the vacuity of the enraged is downvoted and cast aside.thot_experiment 2 minutes ago

>Is there a single Linux phone/tablet that can last an 8 hour day of actual use?What's "actual use"? Furi FLX1 has the best battery life I've seen on a Linux phone. Idling, it last 3+ days. I'm sure it could survive 1 whole day of "actual use". I also think almost any (official) SailfishOS device would last a day of actual use.tczMUFlmoNk 3 minutes ago

As a general rule, you should update yt-dlp before using it. They release new versions very frequently to work around new walls on YouTube and other platforms. An update usually solves this kind of issue for me, even if I've updated just a few days ago.(I haven't tried it today so can't speak to whether this is a complete solution in this particular case.)dylan604 3 minutes ago

I've run every version of macOS since Mac OS X Public Beta.

Yup, this is a crucial detail that the article sort of assumes the reader already knows: the companies being discussed are not actually cooking the food. They are ghost kitchen facility providers. Like WeWork for takeout/delivery cooks. And, surprise: they don’t print money any better than WeWork did.abhinavk 4 minutes ago

What does being upset about it solve?Companies can choose what product to offer and what customers to serve. I can choose what products I'm willing to spend my money and time on.My problem is when I am compelled to use something despite my opposition to it, such as the immigration app I mentioned being force to use under threat of being kicked out of the country.privatelypublic 4 minutes ago

on: Ghost kitchens are dying
A business trading on a name without some kind of sunk cost that incentivizes them to protect that name should be a red flag for consumers.
It's the same thing that's made Amazon a surreal morass of brands like DYBOOP and BIPLOZA.
If
a ghost kitchen can shut down and reopen with a different name just by clicking a few buttons and not actually have to move their kitchen or anything, the whole concept is totally untrustworthy.There was an interesting local example of a place that started out trying to be more or less a ghost kitchen but wound up being forced by success to become a real eatery.
It had the endearingly utilitarian name "Pizza Online Company".
They had no phone nor any in-house delivery system.
You could order online or in-person to pick up, or via GrubHub/Doordash/etc., and that was it.
Initially they had no eating area, just a tiny space big enough for three or four people to stand and wait for their orders.But the pizza wasn't bad and it was (at least at first) remarkably cheap.
It undercut Domino's prices by at least 25% while being much better quality.
The place became popular.
And sure enough when a place becomes popular people start wanting to go there.
They added a small counter with stools to the waiting area.
They didn't have space for more than that inside, but when it wasn't enough they took over some of the strip-mall walkway outside the front door and made it into a patio with seating for 8-10 people.Unfortunately it closed abruptly a couple years ago, apparently due to some kind of family emergency.pdntspa 5 minutes ago

It doesn't have to be this way though. What you're describing is a result of Apple intentionally prioritizing native over web apps to maintain control of their lucrative walled garden.tripletao 5 minutes ago

on: Imperial Tyranny, Korean Humiliation
The press coverage has mostly focused on the pointless show of physical force, the shackles and the prison-like detention. That should be criticized, but it sometimes feels like a tacit acknowledgement that all the workers were unlawfully present, or at least in some kind of "grey zone" (and thus did need to leave, just more humanely).I'm not sure that's true. The B-1 forbids most work, including "construction", but there's a special set of rules for installing equipment sold by your foreign employer:https://travel.state.gov/content/dam/visas/BusinessVisa%20Pu...Many of those detained were employees of Hyundai's equipment vendors. A lawyer for some of those employees is alleging they were in fact compliant for that reason:https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/lawyer-says...If the DHS has evidence to the contrary, then it's had a week to disclose that and save some face. That they haven't may imply a significant fraction of those detained in these harsh conditions were in fact lawfully present.More
