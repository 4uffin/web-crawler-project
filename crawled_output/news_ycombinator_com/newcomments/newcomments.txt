The only thing I can find radioactive enough to be picked up by a cheap GM tube kit is vintage real green uranium glassware. Even a giant bunch of bananas doesn't increase counts enough.willchen 0 minutes ago

Felt like the best example of a true believer. I'd say a similar, but less clear version, would be Dario Amodei vs Sam Altman – Dario comes across as a true believer (who I disagree strongly with) who would be doing AI regardless of the current trends, whereas Sam comes across as a chancer who would be doing cryptocurrencies if that was still big, or social media if that was still the next big thing, evidenced by the fact that he did both of those but they didn't stick so he moved his focus on.Jobs would have been doing consumer computing hardware whatever happened. Apple in the early days wasn't the success it is now, he was fired and went and started another company in the same space (NeXT).al_borland 0 minutes ago

> Just get text-to-speech to slowly read you the recipe.Even this feels like overkill, when a person can just glance down at a piece of paper.I don’t know about others, but I like to double check what I’m doing. Simply having a reference I can look at would be infinitely better than something taking to me, which would need to repeat itself.trhway 0 minutes ago

on: Nvidia buys $5B in Intel
>Nvidia is fabless and has concentrated supplier and geopolitical risk with TSMC.East India Company has been conducting continental wars on its own. A modern company with $4T valuation and a country-GDP-size revenue and possessing key military technology of today and tomorrow wars - AI software and hardware - can successfully wage such a continental war through a suitable proxy, say an oversized private military contractor, and in partcular is capable of defending an island like Taiwan.chipotle_coyote 0 minutes ago

Good news, maybe: macOS 26's Control Center is much more like iOS in that way, and they've also added an API that will let third-party apps offer their own control center widgets.yongjik 1 minute ago

Impressive project, especially for a day's work!My site, https://www.emergentmind.com, is similar, though I'm two years in :)I've found Gemini 2.5 Flash is the best model in terms of speed/cost/quality. Pro is great as well, but probably not necessary for most chat-with-paper functionality.I'll add too that building an AI layer on top of arXiv is a deep, deep rabbit hole depending on how far you want to take the project. Drop me a note if you want to chat more about my experience with it.Regardless, thanks for sharing this!kiratp 1 minute ago

I see no evidence of that. It seems like they tried to put the AI “on rails” with predefined steps and things went wrong.tumnus 1 minute ago

on: The Sagrada Família Takes Its Final Shape
I was transferring through Barcelona and I didn't intend to spend any time there, so I had done absolutely no research on it.But the connection was late so we were put on a bus tour of the city, starting with the mountains outside it. The bus let us out at an overlook with a view of the city, which looked more or less like any other far off city.And then... what the holy hell was that Thing dominating the skyline? It didn't even look real. I had to refocus my eyes just to be able to actually see it.I never did get to go inside, but we drove past, and the driver explained the history of Sagrada Familia. As bizarre as it was from a distance it's even weirder up close. It looks like something by HR Giger. I dare not imagine what's inside.I will have to go some day.paxys 2 minutes ago

There's a simple explanation that isn't 'prerecorded'. I'd be very happy to accuse Meta of faking a demo, but that's 1) just a weird way to fake a demo and 2) effect that has easier explanation.You ask AI how to do something. AI generates steps to do that thing. It has concept of steps, so that when you go 'back' it goes back to the last step. As you ask how to do something, it finishes explaining general idea and goes to first step. You interrupt it. It assumes it went through the first step and won't let you go back.The first step here was mixing some sauces. That's it. It's a dumb way to make a tool, but if I wanted to make one that will work for a demo, I'd do that. Have you ever tried any voice thing to guide you through something? Convincing Gemini that something it described didn't happen takes a direct explanation of 'X didn't happen' and doesn't work perfectly.It still didn't work, it absolutely wasn't wi-fi issue and lmao, technology of the future in $2T company, it just doesn't seem rigged.underlipton 3 minutes ago

I would not be surprised to discover that much of the rest of the company is collapsing because of the amount of resources that have to be poured into AI. There's precedence for this: look at how many game studios have fallen to, "Let's make an MMO!". Even in cases where it succeeds (Square Enix) and becomes a money-printer, most of the rest of the business suffers; because it's the cash-cow, nothing - nothing - is more important than keeping it running (including the judicious production of the last half-dozen games in two of SE's flagship franchises). It's easy to imagine Google diverting and squeezing resources, trying to first catch up and then stay ahead in the LLM AI race, leading to terminal enshittification of Search, and then YouTube, and now Gmail.pabs3 3 minutes ago

So much negativity.I’m just excited that our industry is lead by optimists and our culture enables our corporations to invest huge sums into taking us forward technologically.Meta could have just done a stock buyback but instead they made a computer that can talk, see, solve problems and paint virtual things into the real world in front of your eyes!I commend them on attempting a live demo.RickJWagner 4 minutes ago
