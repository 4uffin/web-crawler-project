In a phone writing text is not as simple, but I also find looking for the right icon there tedious, so I hope there was a better solution. In contrast, imo it is easier to get muscle memory with a keyboard (cmd+space > "first 3 characters of app name") than with searching for the app icon around. I cannot imagine the case where looking around in the launchpad is better except with some app you use so rarely you do not know the name (but somehow you have muscle memory for where it is there?).I use CMD+SPACE 95% of the times I want to open an app. The rest 4% I do it with `open -a` on a terminal with autocomplete (or `/path/to/apps/binary &` for some specific stuff), and 1% going through the `/Applications` directory. I never use launchpad.Waterluvian 0 minutes ago

Pre-Gameboy, when I was a child, my grandfather had a television— the kind that was furniture. Sometimes it would eschew modern trappings like colour and v-sync. I would employ my Classical Vaudevillian training and set it straight with a wallop.keldendorji 0 minutes ago

um....react is literally js and its not a language, you can write react with or without jsx which is just syntax sugar to make it look more like html.ares623 0 minutes ago

In terms of the costs to the grid the picture is not nearly that simple for distributed generation like home PV. Maybe you can defer building a new power plant or upgrading some HV power lines, but you also need the local power infrastructure to be capable of handling bidirectional flow.account42 1 minute ago

> 5 straightforward hooks`useEffect` is straightforward? Cloudflare recently (like, literally 4 days ago)[1] had a pretty big outage because of the improper use of `useEffect`, a hook so infamous if you search "When should I use `useEffect`" you'll get approximately 9 trillion hits, with nearly all of them telling you something different, including Dan Abramov himself having to chip in with multiple blog posts telling people to NOT use it because of how much of a dumpster fire of a API it is.[1] https://blog.cloudflare.com/deep-dive-into-cloudflares-sept-...rpcope1 1 minute ago

on: Public static void main(String[] args) is dead
I too adopted Scala in 2014 and was really satisfied with FP side and how it all was tied with JVM. Honestly I always felt that JVM is a nice platform with a horribly verbose “assembly” language that is Java.Fast forward to around 2020 and I had to organize a team to build search engine in JVM. Given how hard it is to find decent Scala developer I surrendered and did this project in Kotlin. Java devs easily pick up and write sensibly FP-style even code, and builtin coroutines are cool. Even though
I had to open up the internals of coroutines to get tracing to work they felt a very welcome change compared to say monadic explicit async.So for me Kotlin is kind of watered down Scala for typical Java folks and I could tolerate it compared to perspective of writing plain Java.ttkari 1 minute ago

on: Linux phones are more important now than ever
I have a Sony Xperia 10 III with SailfishOS and it easily does 48 hours on a charge when I'm not doing a lot of screen time. Also on days when I use it for tracking / navigation on 6-8 hour bicycle rides it easily lasts for the entire day and then some. I think this is not bad for a device that has been in daily use for almost three years and still has the original battery.I'm running a couple of messenger clients and a web browser (Fennec under Android App Support as the native one is sadly a bit behind the times currently) all the time. The only thing I've noticed to eat a ton of battery is having wifi enabled when outside the range of my own networks, it seems the scanning the phone does in the background to look for known wifi networks is not energy efficient at all.machina_ex_deus 1 minute ago

The real genocide is the barbaric acts of Hamas in 7th of October. They could have released the hostages and this operation wouldn't happen. We're not going to tolerate Hamas any longer, we're not going to allow for a second 7th of October. We couldn't care less what the world has to say, this is life and death situation for Israel.If you had such a threat to murder you and rape your daughters and kidnap you, you wouldn't stay idle. If your kid was kidnapped and held in starvation you wouldn't rest until he's returned.The world is hypocritical and simply hates Jews.Blahah 1 minute ago

LLMs favour React and Tailwind because they’re popular, so they’ve seen a lot of them, not because of technical merit. This is the very manifestation of React winning by default and slowing innovation.vidarh 2 minutes ago

It's not even that much more involved, just tedious. The serialization/deserialization of X requests and responses is fairly straight-forward (it could be more straightforward - it's not a very nice protocol, but it's also not difficult), as the article also shows, and it can be made more compact than that with a couple of helpers.The biggest pain in doing "raw" X is the async nature of the protocol - to write a robust X client you really want an event-loop driven approach that embraces that like XCB does, instead of trying to paper over it (like Xlib did).leokennis 2 minutes ago

Yeah that's not going to happen. Every single surrounding country has a bad history with Palestinians citizens. No Arab nation is interested. They just say enough to keep their own population from kicking off another Arab Spring while hoping Israel will make their problem go away.The only thing that is consistent is that it's a hypocritical shit show out there.ivan_gammel 2 minutes ago

on: "Your" vs. "My" in user interfaces
The role you are describing is UX copywriting. In companies working on international markets it’s common to have it assigned to a dedicated team responsible for localization, but it’s also perfectly normal and common for UX designers to do it - it’s part of their job. Product managers can do it too, but ideally shouldn’t.benterix 3 minutes ago

Though complaints about Microsoft are valid, I am always baffled that the same people that complain about Windows getting worse in terms of privacy and user's control are then pointing to Google Docs and some SaaS crapware as an alternative that enables switch to Linux.Yeah, great, now you have an OS that respects you and you can delete every file in root directory, but use web apps that steal your data from you and you have 0 control over. What a win!frankzander 3 minutes ago

> Preventing births within the group: The attack on Gaza’s largest fertility clinic destroyed thousands of embryos, sperm samples, and eggs. Experts told the commission this would prevent thousands of Palestinian children from ever being born.To be honest, I think this report is reaching.Also it should be noted that Israel did supply Gaza with necessities before the war. To stop these supplies is something different than restricting access. All that doesn't fit with the meaning of the term genocide, no legal investigation changes that. Of course you should be able to put it in front of a judge, but I don't see it how it can be sensibly argued aside as a tool to put some pressure on Israel.More
