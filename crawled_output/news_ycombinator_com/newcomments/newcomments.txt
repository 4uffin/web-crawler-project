on: Why do we keep gravitating toward complexity?
I don't think that's paradoxically, that's just the reality that changing a little thing is easier then considering all cases the code has to handle and figure out a solution which addresses allWhat's paradoxically imo is that often - when someone does decide to remake it in their vision... It's usually isn't improved, if not more complicated now.cwillu 0 minutes ago

on: "Your" vs. "My" in user interfaces
Which pronoun to use is very much a problem introduced by the last couple of generations. How someone or something identifies is irrelevant to almost everything. The antecedent can almost always be identified by context without resorting to irrelevant information like if it's "mine" or "yours", let alone having to choose the proper grammatical gender depending on animate status ("its" vs. "their").I move we strike pronouns entirely from the English language. It turns out they're just too much trouble (although that sentence might be a little awkward). Bring back declensions.stpedgwdgfhgdd 0 minutes ago

Plasma has great contrast and a slightly wider gamut than a CRT.
Neither one have particularly good gamuts unless you're comparing to sRGB.
Many current screens can do much better.diebeforei485 0 minutes ago

Apple still issues software updates for many years beyond the competition. I have a 9.7" iPad Pro from 2016 (mostly a youtube and music device now) and I received a security update today. That is dedication to long time customers.The products have matured. Comparing to last year's product makes no sense because most people don't buy new products every yearA lot of people buying the 17 are coming from the 12 or earlier, and it is a significant upgrade.kovac 0 minutes ago

on: Why do we keep gravitating toward complexity?
"Simplicity is a great virtue but it requires hard work to achieve it and education to appreciate it. And to make matters worse: complexity sells better." - Edsger Wybe Dijkstra.Simple/complex is subjective. Software domain is very diverse that it's unlikely we'd agree on them.Take mathematicians, for instance. They generally have a shared sense of elegance/beauty. That's the result of a refined intuition from years of study.ttoinou 1 minute ago

> we also expect white collar workers to be treated differently than blue collar workers.How should we treat someone (a Korean in this particular case) who doesn't wear his collar ? "Sorry i struck you, but you didn't wear your white collar. Better luck next time". What if a blue collar worker wears a white collar ? Is he excepted from humiliation ?Treating people like animals makes you an animal.londons_explore 1 minute ago

Samsungs Galaxy S21 is also really simple to fix stuff. The back is made of relatively flexible plastic connected via glue, which you can easily get under by blowing into the charging/speaker port. Once your inside its all just a lot of screws.Had to reattach the battery ribbon cable after my phone fell one too many times (I could have also just fixed it by pressing on the back in the right place, but I only really figured that out after I disassembled the phone).LtdJorge 1 minute ago

on: Linux phones are more important now than ever
While I share the concerns about Android, it feels silly to me to go back to Linux's (nonexistent) security model and bad mobile UI/UX. Why not try to fork AOSP or GOS (for broader device compatibility, even if it means giving up some its sexy security properties)?Note that this could include packaging Linux GUI applications as Android APKs (with some additional glue code and Wayland/DBus integration of course), so it's not even an either or.rsynnott 2 minutes ago

> In one tale, the entire crew of a spaceship deliberately infect themselves with the common cold just to feel something.I mean, I'll sometimes take a mild poison for fun, too (that's what alcohol is). And people voluntarily climb Everest. I don't think, in a circumstance where you could just have it go away when you're bored of it, that recreational common cold thing is _that_ weird.pndy 2 minutes ago

That's quite interesting.
How would one go about making one's app or services suspend/resume friendly?Are there well-known good practices?...
Or, do they need to be rediscovered as they are perhaps proprietary know-how?lousken 3 minutes ago

on: Debian Upgrade Marathon: 3.1 Sarge
after upgrading dozens of servers I'd say the biggest pain is if someone installs dpkg package manually and not from a repoalso some very old repos went away over time, so your best bet is to always use the official debian repo, maybe with one extra containing software that should be on that serverwith that said, it's one of the painless upgrades you can doegorfine 3 minutes ago

on: "Your" vs. "My" in user interfaces
Hmm, I guess this then makes sense if we regard the app as a latent space projecting user's data, so its views are awaiting to be activated.Seen this way, the app is basically communicating to the user: Hey I have "Your Pictures", "Your Cases", etc. Click to find out.But to me the "My ..." variation also makes sense. e.g. In Photos app on macOS you will see "My Albums", "My Projects", and although they can be renamed, I don't think I created them.Synaesthesia 3 minutes ago

on: "Your" vs. "My" in user interfaces
Using pronouns is most of the time the sign of an immature team/director/PO or building a service that is of extremely limited target.Trying to be overly friendly and human to the user is cute but doesn't translate well internationally. Very fast one bumps into the sometimes tricky social norms associated with pronouns, and significant time is then spent dealing with the subtilities while the clueless person at the top is bitter about the fuss made about things they still think are trivial.IMHO being clear beats being natural.Even Amazon has this issue where "Your" is very brief in English so they stuck it on "Your Payments" "Your account" etc., and it makes for a weird mess in other languages where it needs to be dropped in some places but not others.binaryturtle 3 minutes ago

I would claim "Your" doesn't belong either. :) UI should be entirely passively describing things to the user only. Same for technical documentation. E.g. just describe what an option does, don't tell the user what they can or not can do.reaperducer 3 minutes ago

I didn't see a location stated in TFA.Where I live, a concert is not considered "public", unless it's a government-run event on government property.Otherwise, a concert is a private event, in which case you have no right to privacy. Just like going into a store.piva00 4 minutes ago

You can't take the human energy in account, because there's no reason to believe they won't live for the same amount of time and use the same amount of energy regardless.You are not accounting for the model training (which can't be ignored, first because you can't ignore fixed costs, and second, because we keep training newer models, so amortizing doesn't quite work), rebound effect, the subsidized bot crawling, etc.I won't comment further on this, this discussion has been rehashed to death anyway and in better ways that I can.IMHO the better way is to not do meaningless cover images, and this is also true of stock, non-AI generated images (I'm not against art, so if it's your strength, by all means, please do meaningful or nice cover images).More
