on: "Your" vs. "My" in user interfaces
The overuse of first person on French official websites also feels weirdly infantilizing.Clicking a button that says "I register" or "I want to pay for a parking ticket", feels so bizarre to me. It's like the website telling you what to click. Like it's holding your hand.I don't usually get mad at petty stuff like this, but this one just pisses me off somehow.theolouvart 0 minutes ago

Appreciate that
Right now it’s proprietary and free, there’s no ongoing cost. I don’t have a pricing model locked in yet. The rough idea is to eventually go freemium (keep the core stuff free, add a paid tier for heavier/advanced use). Still figuring out what makes sense, and I’ll be upfront if/when that changes.The main motivation really was what you mentioned: so many “best practices” live in blog posts or scattered docs, but almost no one actually packages them into something usable. I’m just trying to pull those ideas together in a way that saves people from reinventing the wheel. Still early days, so I’m curious to see if it resonates beyond my own itch.Jolter 0 minutes ago

on: React is winning by default and slowing innovation
Probably due to the extremely large amounts of React code in the training data set, not due to any inherent advantage of the framework.LLM coding will lead to stagnation in languages and frameworks as developers start considering how competent their favorite agent is in each domain.flohofwoe 1 minute ago

I suppose I'm in the minority, but I do like the new changes. It's refreshing, and looks good. Most issues can be tweaked away if you desire that.
(disabling transparency or removing tint window with background wallpaper)What I want is my single row Safari address+tabbar back - why did they take it out? And where the hell is the newly refreshed Terminal.app?rsanheim 1 minute ago

From what I have heard, it weighs on you. Maybe you can tolerate for an hour, and maybe you can do more than me, but I think the weight is the second parameter which puts off people.Reduce weight by 1/3 and same thing for the price, and I will likely buy it.procaryote 1 minute ago

on: Public static void main(String[] args) is dead
Java sometimes has a culture of "the proper way to do this is to take all these little pieces and put them together in a specific way" which probably makes sense for an object oriented purist but is a bit of a drag day to day.The scanner class is one such thing, but you also have things like wrapping a Reader in a BufferedReader to add buffering, and building a Pattern object to build a Matcher object which has a few different methods you can call to actually do anything usefulIt is very OO, but it's also a bit annoying, and more modern java libs tend to give you a more comfortable API. Sadly modern java also tends to come with springboot and people who can't do anything, unless they use springbootdefrost 1 minute ago

It's literally burning surface carbon that's part of the regular surface land, sea, air, carbon flow that's existed for all of human history (and human existence).It's not adding to that cycle by reaching down into the depths of the earths crust to bring up carbon captured and sealed away for longer than human existence .. you know, that additional carbon that is referred to when increased carbon footprints are seriously talked about.mayoff 1 minute ago

But in Java, a program doesn't have a single static entry point. You can have as many different classes as you want, each with its own static void main, and choose which to use as the entry point when you start up your JVM.ku1ik 2 minutes ago

on: Addendum to GPT-5 system card: GPT-5-Codex
It's definitely possible there's a "grass is always greener" effect going on here, to be fair.None of these tools give the impression of being well-tested software. My guess is that neither OpenAI nor Anthropic actually has the necessary density in expertise to build quality software. Google obviously can build good software _when it really wants to_ but in this space its strategy looks like "build the products the other guys are building, cut whatever corners necessary to do this absolutely as fast as possible".So even if my initial impressions are more accurate it's quite possible Google wins long term here.jdkoeck 2 minutes ago

Alas, that’s a common misconception! You’re confusing properties with attributes. Attributes are set through HTML and are stringly typed, but litjs properties can be any js value.For instance, I have a project with a small web component that displays data from a duckdb wasm connection. The connection object is passed as a property and it works flawlessly.ChrisArchitect 2 minutes ago

on: Why do we keep gravitating toward complexity?
Often times, as bad as it sounds, the business value is forgotten by developers who criticize these systems.
Like these systems are already in place, it would be an unrealistic undertaking to exchange them with "less complex" systems.
Businesses unfortunately have to make money, rebuilding something they heavily rely on is not something they can just do (Part of why so many corps are vendorlocked by SAP). Also, where are the less complex systems? I did not see anything as flexible and easy as web tech. Even though it pains me how unsafe it is.dotancohen 3 minutes ago

on: What problems are worth solving?
I'd take this idea further and surmise most problems in the world aren't solvable, with software or not.At least, not in the way of "do X to fix Y." One person such as myself can't solve the climate crisis. Nor can they fix the online social dilemma alone. There are so many layers and nuances to these problems, and they aren't uniform across the board.I've had the opportunity to volunteer, working on software for causes I find compelling -
wildlife conservation, food distribution, and political discourse, to name some.Realistically speaking, most of my work was unrelated to the overarching problem. One was a script to format Excel sheets. Another is a data annotation platform.Yet those still play a role. Saving time with an organization's processes frees time to focus on other goals. More efficient data processing means more research can be done. More organized mailing lists mean more donors, etc. There's a visible impact still.I also feel growing up, there was this pressuring, all-or-nothing mindset - either transform the world or be forever relegated to history as one who did nothing of value. Nothing felt like enough, everything had to be grand.Over time, I've learned the significance of localized action - even within oneself.If you solve a problem you face, you surely solve one that another has shared with you. The loneliness crisis is one close to me - if a social platform helps one person find a connection, it means everything.You may not be able to change the whole world, but you can certainly change at least one.Software may not be the solution, but it can be utilized to discover those answers better, put forth a better version of oneself, and perhaps even inspire more. Perhaps the problem never disappears, but just like a software project, we can iterate to improve it.So, as for which problems are worth solving - I'd say the ones you know best. The ones that help you best, and the ones you're best equipped to solve - regardless of how insignificant they appear.Narew 3 minutes ago

I'm not a front end dev and only use JS stuff time to time for small personal project.
There is so much JS framework out there that appear and disappear so fast. I don't know if we can call it innovation. I have the impression they just reinvent the wheel with so little value added.
I prefer to keep on React at least it will not disappear the next time I will do some change on my project.kshacker 4 minutes ago

Sometimes it takes an event to change your view. I bought my first noise canceling sennheiser about a dozen years back. Hated it. Tried the noise canceling on my airpods. Hated it. Kept Airpods on transparency since most of my usage was during walking and I wanted to hear ambient sound, and never drown that out.Then never tried noise canceling this week while on the plane. I was like ... what happened? Now I am actively looking forward to it.I also used to hate airpods for their disconnects but they have become more reliable, especially if you tell them to remain connected to the last device you manually connected to.Meetings / video chats are an anti-pattern for sure. There is so much communication loss because of other factors - someone forgot to mute, someone forgot to mute, plus what not. You want your side of the communication to be pristine, and even if airpods flake out 1/20 times, it is not good. I agree with you on that.fmbb 4 minutes ago

I used to get in the kind of frustrated situations where, like the author, I spent two days reverse-engineering something I had just bought just to get it to do what I thought it obviously would when I bought it.IOT things like the thing he bought are (were) typically the worst kind of offenders.I just don't do that anymore. It used to bring me pleasure cracking the nut, and that's not the case any longer.These days, if it does not do what I need more or less out of the box, I just return it / send it back and research the follow-up buy better.globular-toast 4 minutes ago

More money. More power. Greed. Don't ever underestimate human greed. It doesn't matter what people have or where they are, they will always want more.

Also react in particular in combination with tailwind seems to be easier for LLMs to generate. Probably due to the condensed syntax, no split between code, css and html, plus the color naming scheme of tailwind.akimbostrawman 4 minutes ago

While I think man pages are perfectly fine as documentation, the terminal interface for accessing them is awful (more mysterious keypresses or incantations to memorize if you want to do anything more than scroll), and visually I have always found them very difficult to scan visually, particularly if I wasn't sure of the exact wording for the task I needed, or if I am thinking in a different vocabulary. Plus theres the whole wall-of-text thing that makes me kind of instinctively bounce out.A lot of them also lack sufficient (or any) examples, which are the things I need to see to learn. Making sense of the their sometimes (and seemingly intentionally) obtuse wording when I'm trying to do something I'm not already familiar with makes them a lot harder to parse than they need to be.And many of the commands are extremely arbitrary. `cd` (change directory) very well could have been `mf` (move folder). `del` in DOS is `rm` in Linux. `move` vs `mv`, `copy` vs `cp`, etc etc. There's no common orthodoxy. If you are not well versed in the history of this stuff its all gobbledygook.LLMs have been great in this regard, as they can supply those missing examples and then explain to me exactly what it is doing, oftentimes worded more clearly than the original documentation. And they can help me string together whole sequences.liendolucas 5 minutes ago

on: Linux phones are more important now than ever
I tried the fantastic DroidVNC-NG (KUDOS to the author) app because I wanted to see if I could stream a whole Android phone left at home at all times.The idea was attempting to switch to PostmarketOS, so if I ever needed to use a banking app I could do it through this phone via a VNC client. You can't.Banking apps black the login screen. Even if that is ok for 99.9% of users, I know what I'm doing and I do not absolutely have the fucking choice to disable that. The thing I found out is that every time I come up with something that should be doable, either Android or the fucking app or something else prevents me from moving away.My biggest drag is banking because almost everything else I can leave it out. And I believe I don't have a choice.More
