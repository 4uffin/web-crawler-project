“Optics” just means you (also) care about how the situation looks like.Having a RAV4 when a Yaris would have done the job is optics. Sometimes having any car at all is about optics.hackercat010 0 minutes ago

> Additionally, a lot of people who would otherwise be in the used car market for price reasons in the US cannot afford to purchase even a used car outright, and getting financing for cars sold on the private market is, to my knowledge, not really possible.To me, that's the biggest reason for used-car prices to be low - the market is restricted to those who have cash.
IME, the prices of cars that cannot be financed (older than 5 years) is severely constrained. I've seen a 5 year old model advertised for exactly twice the price as an almost identical 6 year old model, with similar mileage and similar condition[1].I find that hard to reconcile with the other posters in this thread who observed
that used cars are still too expensive. Maybe they are looking at used-cars that can still be financed (under $X years, for example)?=======================[1] Condition of both was reported by the same independent assessor - see my posting upthreadHikikomori 0 minutes ago

This isn't the American way apparently, do you want to be a True American Patriot or some loser driving a shitboxI still remember the first thing my bank offered me as a student in the US, a credit card, 25%+ apr, give that to a 18 years old clueless kid and you'll set them up for failure. The entire system is setup to make you think these interests rate are normal and that being in debt is a proper lifestylefractallyte 0 minutes ago

That's a whole other argument about which I have even stronger opinions - namely about the dismal failure of government, and the flaws in our democratic systems that allow corporations to infiltrate governments and manipulate policies.unwind 1 minute ago

I'd say (from northern Europe) that 500 g [1] is a standard pack of butter, even though they've also added the smaller "half packs" of 250 g. For professional use, there's also the full kilogram. Whoa that has got to be expensive these days.[1]: https://www.arla.se/produkter/svenskt-smor/singularity2001 1 minute ago

I had opposite issue, again and again. "My gut" was actually correct again and again. I ignored it because if trying to be rational and objective. The gut was a lot more correct at identifying interpersonal threats and bad actors.overfeed 1 minute ago

> It's absurd to me that people should commit code they don't understandThe industrywide tsunami of tech debt arising from AI detritus will be interesting to watch. Tech leadership is currently drunk on improved productivity metrics (via lines of code or number of PRs), but I bet velocity will slow down, and products be more brittle due to extraneous AI-generated, with a lag, so it won't be immediately apparent. Only teams with rigorous reviews will fare well in the long term, but may be punished in the short term for "not being as productive" as others.niutech 1 minute ago

on: The HackberryPi CM5 handheld computer
Tbh I never thought of that but yeah, it would be nice. Hypothetically if you have a 3d printer, you can modify this guy's designs and add a removable battery cover: https://github.com/strtfnst/uConsole-PartsPersonally I got the lora-gps-wifi-sdr expansion board and I found that he had a design to cover the otherwise exposed top of the port, I modified it a bit so that I have direct access to the power button(his covers the power indicator, which I hate) and trimmed it off a bit cause it was too bulky for my likings.That said, you have a point. The reason why I've got a rpi4 as opposed to 5 is partially because of the thermals but also partially because of the battery life. You know what, I might actually work on that when I have some time to spare.lukan 1 minute ago

So does the mix now call for slightly smaller eggs?Or has the mix changed to still work with the same number of eggs?If the former, that is stupid. If the latter, then the flavour/consistency is bound to change.schoen 2 minutes ago

I don't get this at all. I'm an urban know-nothing about cars. The current car I have I bought online from a private seller. I insisted on taking the car to a 3rd party mechanic for an assessment. Paid for the assessment, then bought the car.It is spending maybe $400-$500 to save potentially over $10000eesmith 2 minutes ago

In 1981, the Betty Crocker Supreme Fudge Brownie Mix included a 5.5 oz can of Hershey's syrup. In 1949 you could get a 5 oz can when you purchase 2 quarts of ice cream. https://archive.org/details/mansfield-news-journal-1949-08-1...It came in multiple sizes. 5 oz is probably the "small can" mentioned at https://archive.org/details/trinity-parish-of-newton-centre/... .There was also a 16 oz can, https://archive.org/details/escanaba-daily-press-1964-12-10/... and https://archive.org/details/childrenasconsum0000mcne/page/11... and https://archive.org/details/The_Times_News_Idaho_Newspaper_1... and https://archive.org/details/cupl_004738/mode/2up?q=%22can+of... .And an 8 pound can (!) for food services. https://archive.org/details/foodloversguidet0000harr_d5o7/pa...madaxe_again 2 minutes ago

on: Introduction to GrapheneOS
Is strcat the person who supposedly stepped down?If so, I'm glad he's still project lead. I would have immediately written off GrapheneOS as a lost cause if he wasn't.I have spent many hours reading his extremely comments on Android and smartphone security. He obviously knows what he's doing. Not only is he competent, it's also clear that he cares way too much about GrapheneOS and is personally invested in it. I wouldn't want anyone else making decisions.And that's coming from a guy who publicly disagreed with him on some ideological issue merely days ago.dnissley 4 minutes ago

"Car" typically means "passenger vehicle" in common parlance, at least in the US. A lot of truck sales like you point to are fleet sales for work vehicles, so this person is probably pointing more towards non-fleet sales, where the RAV4 is indeed the top seller.close04 4 minutes ago

I thought most of the existing engines out there were too complicated, so I wanted it to be easy to use. Probably that's also why it became that popular.For a modern engine today - I think the architecture of the engine would look different - and would focus more on creating and organizing content then mostly on rendering.menaerus 5 minutes ago

But x86_64 does outperform ARM64 in high-performance workloads. High-performance workloads are not single-threaded programs. Maybe if Apple decides one day to manufacture the server CPU, which I believe they will not since they would have to open their chips to Linux. OTOH server aarch64 implementations such Neoverse or Graviton are not as good as x86_64 in terms of absolute performance. Their core design cannot yet compete.MrJohz 5 minutes ago

on: Gleam is my new obsession
Doesn't Erlang/Elixir solve this by having every function do its own parsing (via pattern matching) and then failing fast if something goes wrong?
That seems intuitively like a good approach to take — you can't make any real guarantees across machine boundaries, but you can use structural typing at the edges to ensure that the data coming across the boundaries has the right shape.notpachet 6 minutes ago

> AI doesn't use any more water or energy than any other tool. An hour of Netflix uses same energy as more than 100 GPT questions. A single 10 hour flight (per person*) emits as much as around 100k GPT prompts. It is strange that one would repeat the same nonsense about AI without primary motive being ideological.We should stop doing those things too. I'm still surprised that so many people are flying.More
