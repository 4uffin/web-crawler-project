Your second case was in the WD of Texas which is where he was arrested - it's just minutia to have him 'removed' to the ED of Texas to face charges where he was indicted - this is the main case there:https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/16517474/united-states-...buyucu 0 minutes ago

It's pretty clear this is happening.The question is... is this based on existing capability of LLMs to do these jobs? Or are companies doing this on the expectation that AI is advanced enough to pick up the slack?I have observed a disconnect in which management is typically far more optimistic about AI being capable of performing a specific task than are the workers who currently perform that task.And to what extent is AI-related job cutting just an excuse for what management would want to do anyway?greesil 0 minutes ago

While agentic coding can make you productive, it won't teach you to deeply understand the source code, algorithms, or APIs produced by AI. If you can't thoroughly audit any source code created by an AI agent, then you are definitely not a senior developer.RajT88 0 minutes ago

Her edit is wrong, and probably deliberate, for that she will be criticized. But Kirk did write and say some truly heinous things. That much is something we all know.zoeysmithe 0 minutes ago

on: Robert Redford Has Died
I know we live in an age where if someone dies, you cannot criticize him, but Redford is famous for the blackballing of James Woods. I vehemently disagree with Woods' politics but that shouldnt preclude him from employment.I saw this as leftist, but "The Truth" is liberal porn, and whitewashes Rathers's
lack of due dillegence in the Bush document, which even to a largely uniformed person like me thought, "Uh isnt that a modern font?" Dan Rather's rush to to this story is not a 'victim' but the failure of basic journalism.Jane Fonda wrote about how he's problematic with women and he lived in an age where metoo would be a fever dream. Heaven knows the details here but I imagine there's a lot of stuff here that's really ugly from the typical "hollywood playboy" type thing.Shrug, I've always seen his PR as very heavily manufactured.Ajedi32 0 minutes ago

> I'm interested in knowing whether there's something intrinsic to Go that encourages such a culture.I think it's because the final deliverable of Go projects is usually a single standalone binary executable, whereas with Node the final deliverable is usually an NPM package.yellowapple 1 minute ago

I think the key aspect here is scale: if the person making the decision knows the people affected, you usually see a pattern of different results than without that human connection. Large companies tend to be bad both from isolation and because the frontline people increasingly are not allowed to make decisions or consulted or even known by the people who are.hyperzzw 1 minute ago

Hi, I have read your interesting paper. I recommend you our previous HyperZZW paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.17948). I think there are a lot of similar concepts here.1. Context-dependent convolution2. Global & Local branches3. Replace large-filter Conv with matrix multiplication4. Information bottleneck -> Information lossI also want to share that Mamba is based on the concept of Hyena. And the simplicity is the best (HyperZZW), and Hyena is a failure.RodgerTheGreat 1 minute ago

That's much longer than a quarterly earnings report away, which makes it "somebody else's problem" for the executives pushing these policies. There's no reason to expect these people to have a long-term strategy in mind as long as their short-term strategy gives them a golden parachute.account42 1 minute ago

Yes, https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/63291773/united-states-....Navy sailor was convicted of possessing machine guns and destructive devices.The ATF for example put back together de-milled RPGs, which could be a destructive deviceHowever the statute says the following:
(2) any type of weapon by whatever name known which will, or which may be readily converted to, expel a projectile by the action of an explosive or other propellant, the barrel or barrels of which have a bore of more than one-half inch in diameter, except a shotgun or shotgun shell which the Secretary finds is generally recognized as particularly suitable for sporting purposes; and (3) any combination of parts either designed or intended for use in converting any device into a destructive device as defined in subparagraphs (1) and (2) and from which a destructive device may be readily assembled.
The ATF took his demilled RPG, put another gun (owned by the ATF) inside of it, then fired it to prove it had a bore over 0.5 inch capable of expelling projectile.But the state didn't tell him under what definition he was charged, so they didn't know if they were defending against the collection of parts the ATF took (falls under 3), or against the weapon the ATF claimed it was after they put the parts together (which falls under 2).RajT88 1 minute ago

on: Mother of All Demos
People talk about Apple stealing from Xerox, but what you may not know is that Douglas Engelbart's team at SRI left shortly after this demo and took everything to Xerox without him. The man spent the rest of his career being swept into gutters, never got any recognition until the early 2000s at the very end of his life. It's a really tragic tale.Bullfight2Cond 1 minute ago
