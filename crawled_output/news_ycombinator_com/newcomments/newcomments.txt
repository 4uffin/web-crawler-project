Why are you using chocolate chips? Real bakers get the cacao pods from the grocery store, ferment the nibs inside for a month, then carefully formulate their own chocolate to pour into boutique chips of their own making.As other comments point out, there is no added value in the pre-made ones, make your own chips! Oh, and the mixing bowl, why not take up glass-blowing? It's relatively easy to make your own bowls.cogman10 0 minutes ago

If you look up the purpose of the various ingredients you quickly find that they are simply filling roles that other more commonly used household ingredients can take with minimal to no impact on flavor.Dextrins, for example, are simply thickening agents.
Corn starch/potato starch.
glycerides are literally just fats and added because most fats can't be powdered.
Butter works just as well and is in fact preferable. Surfactants are soap, often simply used for emulsification.
There's a bunch of cooking techniques to achieve that but, frankly, it's often not needed. "specific leavening ratios" is just silly.
Yes, baking power and/or soda are needed in a lot of baking and you need to add enough and not too much.
It isn't, however, and unforgiving ratio.
A few grams more or less won't make a difference that anyone would care about.Yes, the boxed recipe has been specifically tweaked to be as foolproof and forgiving as possible.
Further, there's definitely times where ingredients are added simply because it gives just a slight benefit to the outcome.
But it's not as if you can't get close if not better with a from scratch recipe depending on what you are making.
Angel food cake, for example, is far better when done from scratch.
So are a few cakes like texas sheet cake and arguably brownies (that one is a holy war).TonyPeakman 1 minute ago

You're missing a very important reason4 - There is a very active anti-LLM activist movement and they care more about participating in it than they care about free software.For example, see their rationale, which are just canned anti-LLM activist talking points. You see the same ones repeated and memed ad nauseam if you lurk on anti-AI spaces.malnourish 2 minutes ago

I first noticed this with Triscuits - they both changed the size of the box/content, but also shrunk the actual "chip" (sorry not sure what to call a triscuit)Super dishonest shit here.
Glad more people are noticing finally but 100% don't expect Nestle or the other big 3 to make any changes back.Inflation never seems to reverse, especially with food products.MBCook 2 minutes ago

I’ve seen the stronger x86 memory model argued as one of the things that affects its performance before.It’s neat to see real numbers on it. Didn’t seem to be very big in many circumstances which I guess would have been my guess.Of course Apple just implemented that on the M1 and AMD/Intel had been doing it for a long time. I wonder if later M chips reduced the effect. And will they drop the feature once they drop Rosetta 2?foldl2022 3 minutes ago

I think you're being extremely judgmental and making a lot of assumptions.I didn't see any "helpless" in the article. I see someone who doesn't want to spend twice the money for no good reason, and then have leftover ingredients they don't have any other use for.It's sad that you seem unable to sympathize with someone else's inconvenience and chose to diminish them instead.When standard ingredient sizes change, that have remained unchanged for decades, and lots of recipes are scaled to match them precisely, you... choose to call people helpless, rather than call it out as corporate greed?It's actually constructive, not "helpless", to stop buying the product, because if enough people do that, the company gets the message and brings back the old size.tstrimple 4 minutes ago

It’s actually the opposite. Immediately after Kamala got the nod there was an enormous amount of energy surrounding her nomination that she managed to entirely squander. If Kamala had less time as the main candidate she would have done better. She ran a shit campaign and bled support the entire time. I can’t imagine why anyone wasn’t impressed with her promises to maintain the status quo and her ability to campaign with war criminals from the Bush era.valorzard 4 minutes ago

Then you’re certainly a domain expert in making that kind of calculation, so I do retract my comment. I do not, however, retract my assertion that nobody in a modern society should have to make that kind of calculation to such an extreme. $8k/year is hardcore, and if you’re doing that successfully, I both tip my hat to you and am a little horrified. I hope you’re doing it because you want to and not because you’re forced to.shoo 4 minutes ago

on: My thoughts on renting versus buying
problem is, politically it is feasible for government to support policy that superficially appears to help home buyers, but also props up housing prices. like all these "give the first home buyers more money / access to loans / reduced stamp duty" policiesa government with an actual serious policy to increase housing supply, which should cause housing prices to fall, might have a lot of trouble getting elected or staying elected (only 1/3 of australian households rent, but that'll increase over time due to wealth inequality)davebranton 4 minutes ago

I very strongly suspect that this preference is learned. I've never made anything from a mix, but I've baked brownies, cookies, sponge, tarts, biscuits and bread. They have all turned out perfectly delicious, without any need for the addition of whatever emulsifiers and what-not you'll find in the premixed packets.This isn't to say that there's necessarily anything wrong with those ingredients. I'm sure that they're perfectly safe to eat, but they are simply not required. This seems to be a peculiarly American thing, permitting a large corporation to insert itself in the supply chain without there being any need whatsoever for them to be there.In the rest of the world, where most of us live, there seems to be almost no examples of cake "recipes" containing anything other than basic ingredients. I've literally never even seen a recipe for anything that says "Add one box of brownie mix". I can hardly even imagine such a recipe existing. It boggles my mind.th0ma5 5 minutes ago

Corporations don't do things that people don't want to pay for.The entire purpose of their existence is to provide products to customers that want them.The miraculous thing is people eschewing responsibility by putting blaming the person selling products to the people that want them.If ot weren't for all those drug dealers, we wouldn't have any addicts.thekevan 6 minutes ago

Making a game is already a financial dead end. The only way to make money doing it is by dumping a lot of resources into marketing, or by making the game extremely good. AI art won't get you the quality you need, but making your own art will improve your gamedev skills in a sustainable direction.bruce511 6 minutes ago

Mate, you are so wrong here, but I completely accept that your belief here is not unique.Firstly, there's a lot wrong with using processed foods, but I'll skip over that.If processed food is now "traditional" then that's a bit sad. Really.Secondly, made from scratch tastes way better than box mix. Because, you know, flavors. Now I get that tastes, especially nostalgic tastes, are very subjective so YMMV. But processed foods are always made to fit a broad market, so are typically bland. Cake mixes typically use sugar as "flavor", so "tastes good" to someone raised on an American diet will tend to lean on high-fat, high-sugar.Outside the US the emphasis is more on flavor than sugar. A coffee cake has a strong coffee taste. A chocolate cake uses real chocolate and so on. Using better ingredients makes for a better result.Getting consistenty in baking is really not hard. Yes, it takes a bit of practice. But it's a skill a child can learn. My son was baking by himself at 6 years old. It really isn't hard. And it really does turn out better. And ultimately it has better food value as well.Yes, I agree, that US culture is different. The days of grandma teaching kids to bake, of parents teaching kids to bake or cook is dwindling. It's sad to see this learned helplessness in the kitchen, which then leads to dependence on "big food" to decide what you eat. Fortunately they prioritize your health, not their profit.Personally I'm grateful that my elders taught me to cook, and something I taught to my kids. If you are able to, I recommend it as a skill with passing on.Calling it "snobby" suggests that it is a skill you have not yet acquired. And indeed a skill you feel you cannot acquire. You are incorrect. It is easy to do, you really can learn how, and the results are far superior.wenbin 7 minutes ago

Maybe some of them already embed some simple, secret marker to identify their own generated content. But people outside the organization wouldn’t know. And this still can’t prevent other companies from training models on synthetic data.Once synthetic data becomes pervasive, it’s inevitable that some of it will end up in the training process. Then it’ll be interesting to see how the information world evolves: AI-generated content built on synthetic data produced by other AIs. Over time, people may trust AI-generated content less and less.cm2012 7 minutes ago

That’s correct. Some grandpas don’t know how to fix their own car or build their own furniture, either. I’m not sure if you’re expressing surprise or disdain here, but neither seems called for.litoE 7 minutes ago

on: My thoughts on renting versus buying
In our condominium building (42 floors) the rule is that every apartment owner is responsible for any damages to their apartment, even if they are caused by an apartment in an upper floor. This is because otherwise the owners of the upper floors would have to have million-dollar insurance premiums to cover the possibility of a leak in their apartment causing damages to multiple floors below.
We had an event where a burst pipe in the 28th floor caused damages all the way down to the 8th floor.jjmarr 7 minutes ago

I've been using AI to contribute to LLVM, which has a liberal policy.The code is of terrible quality and I am at 100+ comments on my latest PR.That being said, my latest PR is my second-ever to LLVM and is an entire linter check. I am learning far more about compilers at a much faster pace than if I took the "normal route" of tiny bugfixes.I also try to do review passes on my own code before asking for code review to show I care about quality.LLMs increase review burden a ton but I would say it can be a fair tradeoff.steveklabnik 8 minutes ago
