I just keep a cheap screen and a cheap keyboard near my servers. No need for a mouse. For my garage and basement servers, the KV stays in place always, and the MIL's condo, the KV goes away when not in use... and the keyboard got moved at some point, so I have to remember to bring it over when it needs adjusting.Around me, most days I can stop at goodwill and get a monitor and keyboard for $30 or less.pabs3 0 minutes ago

> need to migrate everything from their walled garden (at great cost)It's not just about migrating the phone, if you own an Apple Watch, AirPods, one of their laptops, their online services, etc. all that stuff works best within the Apple ecosystem. If you move they don't work as well (if at all) and you may need to replace them. If you are deeply bought in to Apple products, it really isn't that easy to move.nicman23 1 minute ago

No, as far as I know. But as a merchant, in theory you can block that customer from making future payments. But probably only their specific card or email.db48x 1 minute ago

They are associated with a class, but the class is basically the file. There are limitations by doing it this way but it is out of preview and officially supported as of Java 25.https://openjdk.org/jeps/5121718627440 2 minutes ago

on: The Obsolescence of Political Definitions (1991)
It does have a specific meaning referring to a historic entity, when its not used as a slur.
That's what I wanted to point out, see the sibling comment for clarification.I don't see this to be commonly used as a slur except maybe from people, who also use capitalist as a slur.
Most times it is used to describe parties or policies that have national and populist agendas, so I think its not a stretch to compare them to fascistic agendas.naruhodo 2 minutes ago

Nope. It's just sugar. [1]It's somewhat implicit in the JVM spec, but functions are always bound to classes as methods. [2] The only kinds of heap objects you can have a reference to are class instances and arrays. [3]The lack of free functions is really only a minor inconvenience for language implementers. Clojure, for instance, just compiles new classes to hold functions as methods.From a programmer's perspective, you can write lambdas, but again, it's just syntactic sugar over an inner class.[1] https://www.happycoders.eu/java/main-method/

Many of these are all excellent points. I did exclude the case.The car recycling v.s. electronics recycling question is interesting. I once had a very interesting conversation with an electronics recycler on a plane trip - phones could not be recycled like other electronics because of some of the metals content - in particular beryllium copper content (used in spring contacts). He described it as a lot of electronics is ground up and a chemical processes used to extract the valuable elements. With phones the grinding up was the toxic / dangerous prohibited part.I think the semiconductor numbers are more subtle though. It is sq. mm in the product and yield that are factors. A single power switching element in a Tesla will likely exceed the total silicon sq. mm usage in an AirPod. There is a lot of electronics in a Tesla. Some of the Tesla circuitry is more exotic, Silicon Carbide or GaN. I need to look into how much recovery / reprocessing silicon mfg is using for the reagents. The waste produced isn't as bad as it was in the Silicon Valley heyday where every original mfg site is now a superfund site with very large plumes of toxic waste in the subsoil.Peteragain 3 minutes ago

What we seem to have forgotten is just how c like java was compared to other programming languages being advocated at the time. Objects made sense (remember Ada?) but c++ was a mess. Java was a breath of fresh air with lots of c legacy.guidedlight 3 minutes ago

My guess is that it’s all product managers and “designers” now, a whole religion of procedures and terminology, and unfortunately very little engineering of the kinds that some of the early Ux pioneers applied.voidfunc 4 minutes ago

Being forced to use anonymous classes to simulate lambdas prior to 8 was the biggest source of annoying boiler plate IMO and was genuinely a bad experience in sufficiently complex or large code bases.Everything beyond 8 has been nice to have but 8 was the big one.akomtu 4 minutes ago

Well, onnxruntime is also having polyglot bindings, and yet another way to avoid Python.Yes, you can package Python alongside your APK, if you feel like having fun making it compiled with NDK, and running stuff even more slowly in phone ARM chipsets over Dalvik JNI than it already is on desktops.nicman23 4 minutes ago

This is such a unfair interpretation, it's a false equivalence argument. "OS X added Terminal and throwing out HIG for a UNIX-y UI" is a moot point.It's not about loyalty, it's about Apple's own coherence and vision as a creative-technology company, and a bunch of sophisticated users offering a critique of it over time. Read it that way and it makes a lot more sense.Beneath the Apple "fandom" or any fandom there are valid reasons why they came to be (the quality of the product), and we ought to elevate that than call customers naive for not adopting the very corporate cynicism that is a result of anticompetitive economics.More
