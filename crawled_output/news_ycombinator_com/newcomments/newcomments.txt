Agreed, UN doesn't have a great reputation in America, I'm skeptical many people will care about this outside the media news cycle.For example, only 52% percent of Americans had a favorable opinion of UN in 2024 https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/09/05/most-peop...On a political or legal level it might have more implications though but ICJ will focus on the leaders who can avoid visiting certain countries.dotnet00 0 minutes ago

It doesn’t seem to stop people being okay with <42 hour smart watch charges, so I’m not so convinced this will be the limiting factor unless you need the prescription version of these (which rules them out for me, I’m happy with my dumb-glasses that I’ve never had to plug in to anything)BolexNOLA 0 minutes ago

I think it is quite high, especially for newcomers to the ecosystem. The popular sdkman CLI tool for managing JDK installations provides 17 different JDKs to install:https://sdkman.io/jdks/With the DotNet SDK for comparisons sake, there is but one provider.dragonwriter 0 minutes ago

> What does this “stake” get America at all?“America” is an abstraction. It gets the people who will own the new entity something, and its gets the government decisionmakers something, and that’s, in practice, more important than what it gets “America”.sunshowers 1 minute ago

I'm glad, but my problem is with the claim that modern C++ is safer. They added new features that are very easy to misuse.Meanwhile in Rust you can freely borrow from the stack in closures, and the borrow checker ensures that you'll not screw up. That's what (psychological) safety feels like.major505 1 minute ago

And that was always known to have been a counter-productive protest. There's nothing ironic about this. They were told. They didn't care.It was unambiguously clear that no matter how bad you felt Obama/Biden/Harris were on Israel, Trump was/would be worse.If every single human life is worth saving (and it is), it's indisputable that Trump is worse for Gaza than Harris would have been.RandallBrown 1 minute ago

Framework's whole reputation is based on upgradeable, modular design right? It's certainly surprising to me that their desktop seems to be the opposite of that.dottjt 1 minute ago

Perhaps this is an aside, but for my anniversary my partner bought me a pair of JBL glasses that also act as headphones.Absolutely love them. They're not absolutely essential, but they're a nice-to-have and they're a lot more convenient than putting in ear buds.The problem though is that I would never have thought to ever buy them myself. I feel this way about these AR glasses.FreakLegion 1 minute ago

That list seems to be limited to political targets.

Also, that lock file include development dependencies and dependencies for opt-in features like PCRE2. A normal `cargo build` will use quite a bit fewer than 65 dependencies.I would actually say ripgrep is not especially typical here. I put a lot of energy into keeping my dependency tree slim. Many Rust applications have hundreds of dependencies.We aren't quite at thousands of dependencies yet though.FergusArgyll 2 minutes ago

I don't think "was always" is an accurate statementHowever, above and beyond free, it is also a collection of ECMA standards https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/standa...Now, don't get me wrong: I have grave suspicions there is currently only one actual implementation of them (I don't count hobby, or abandonware, ones) but IMHO "actual standard" combined with "for real reference implementation" is way better than just reference implementationVelocifyer 2 minutes ago

on: Should We Drain the Everglades?
>Did this giant dike work? Did the 143 miles of dikes work? Let’s see what Wikipedia says:>>The enlarged water control structures around Lake Okeechobee and in the Everglades did not prevent either frequent floods or dry spells in which cattle died for lack of water and fires burned in the peat of the Everglades.>So yeah, that’s a no. A big ol’ drought (technical term) ensued!This is a good example of how a little knowledge can be a dangerous thing. We actually do know that the Hoover Dike worked: it survived Hurricanes Andrew, Francis, Wilma, Milton, and several others I probably forgot to mention.respondo2134 2 minutes ago

this seems highly unlikely. Almost all of the software we're discussing in this context has little or no resources behind it. No lawyers are going to sue an OSS developer because there's no payday.FridayoLeary 2 minutes ago

The thought of an airport full of people all seated with perfect posture,
all looking ahead but not really seeing, tapping away at their oh-so important work, feels both worse than the current status quo but also somehow no different. Maybe it’s the posture thing.qmr 3 minutes ago

Overloaded operators are great.
But overloaded operators that do something entirely different than their intended purpose is bad.
So a + operator that does an add in your custom numeric data type is good.
But using << for output is bad.ibejoeb 3 minutes ago

NPM needs some kind of attestation mechanism. There needs to be an independent third party that that has the fingerprint, and then npm must verify it before a change is published. It could even be just DNS or well-known URI that, if changed, triggers lockdown. Then, even in the case of a successful compromise of an NPM account or source control, whether via phishing like the last one or token exfiltration like this one, it will remain unpublished.renewiltord 3 minutes ago

The paycheck to paycheck stat is bullshit, man, come on. Do you guys just believe everything you read? Like some payday loan company publishes a marketing blogpost and you guys take it like it's the gospel truth spoken by Jesus the only begotten Son of God who died on the cross so that we may be saved from our sins. For your own sake apply some epistemic discipline.https://www.slowboring.com/p/this-economic-myth-needs-to-go-...HackerThemAll 3 minutes ago

And .NET is truly cross-platform for 11 years already (since .NET Core 3.0 was released). No licensing/patent/litigation issues since then.Great GUI cross-platform GUI toolkit (MAUI), great WASM engine (Blazor).Upcoming .NET 10 is going to be awesome.More
