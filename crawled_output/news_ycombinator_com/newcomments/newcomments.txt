on: Betty Crocker broke recipes by shrinking boxes
I'm confused.
So you are dismissing them?Then I do disagree with you.
Dismissing the ingredients needs an actual reason they're bad, not just a way to replace them.NoiseBert69 0 minutes ago

I understand the point you're trying to make, but I think I can at least sort of understand why they're going with this speed of release cadence. If the release cadence is too slow, you might end up with another JPEG situation where the new codec is undeniably better in every way, but nobody wants to implement it since the old standard was around for so long without any competition.DennisP 0 minutes ago

If it really is the goal to increase treasuries demand by means of stablecoins, then I would expect them to enforce this. If the stablecoins aren't really buying the assets then they do nothing for demand.If another goal is to enrich the Trump family, then they could forgo enforcement on the World Liberty Financial stablecoin. But they could still enforce the act for everyone else.Increasing demand for treasuries, thus keeping interest rates down, also directly benefits Trump because he's bought at least $100 million in bonds since becoming president.https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/trump-buys-more-100-mill...mcv 0 minutes ago

I'm old enough to remember when supermarkets had boxes. All the goods they sell comes to them in big cardboard boxes, and and supermarkets would have a fenced off area where they dumped all those boxes, so whenever a customer needed a box to put their groceries in to take them home, they'd get a box from that fenced off area.I haven't seen those in decades unfortunately. It was a great way to reuse those boxes.Pxtl 0 minutes ago

Literally any scarce and durable good can be a store of value.
A pound of Osmium is about a million bucks.
So building massive server farms to store something equivalent to an inert rock is kind of uninteresting.o11c 0 minutes ago

on: Boring work needs tension
In the 1950s through the beginning of the 1970's the government (ARPA) was paying young scientists and innovators to do their PhD thesis' in computer design to create the next generation of human oriented computer interfaces. Now we have articles talking about how shit it is to work with computers. What the fuck man.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sketchpadhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NLS_(computer_system)bri3d 1 minute ago

on: Wanted to spy on my dog, ended up spying on TP-Lin...
Ha! I actually use TinyPilot all the time, nice!> I agree that would be nice, but it also doesn't sound all that practical for a small vendor.Personalizing / customizing per device always introduces a huge amount of complexity (and thus cost). However, this is TP-Link we're talking about, who definitely have the ability to personalize credentials at scale on other product lines.And again, to be clear, I'm not trying to argue that the current way is some horrible disaster from TP-Link, just advocating for a better solution where possible. I think the current system reads as fine, honestly, it sounds like typical cobbled together hardware vendor junk that probably has some huge amount of "real" vulnerability in it too, but this particular bit of the architecture doesn't offend me badly.> now you have to unwind your manufacturing and fulfillment pipeline to get back all the devices you've shipped.This can be avoided with some other type of proof-of-presence side channel which doesn't rely on manufacturing personalization - for example, a physical side-channel like "hold button to enable some PKI-based backup pairing or firmware update mode." For a camera, there should probably be an option to make this go away once provisioning is successful, since you don't want an attacker performing an evil maid attack on the device, but for pre-provisioning, it's a good option.bix6 1 minute ago

on: My thoughts on renting versus buying
No, it's not, not always is my point. We don't count the asset of having the home because we're comparing that part to the stock market investment.Made up numbers: consider:Mortgage: 2,000
Home price: 200,000
Difference from rent: -500Rent: 1,500
Home price: 0
Difference from mortgage: +500If (500/month invested over 30 years) > (200,000 appreciated home price over 30 years) then you came out on top by renting.It might be or it might not be.Also, the type of asset matters. Stock might be a more flexible asset than real estate, in which case you should probably rent depending on your location.chrisweekly 1 minute ago

you are right about the additional layer of needing ratification by US states, but other than that, i see no difference. in the end it's just a name for a specific concept, and the concepts of Grundgesetz and Verfassung are not different enough to argue over which name is correct. i disagree that the difference is the reason why germany named it Grundgesetz. they could have decided to name it Verfassung instead, and nothing would have changed. we would still have the same rules to change it. there is nothing in the name that forces a different approach.more interesting is the actual contents and the principles that are being covered. debt brake for example in my opinion has no business being part of a constitution or Grundgesetz. it should never have been added there in the first place. that's not what a constitution is for. putting stuff like that in there weakens the constitution and makes a mockery of it. it reeks of planned economy.that doesn't mean that the debt brake is bad, or that it should not be protected by requiring a 2/3rd vote to change it. there just should be a different place for that, in order to keep the Grundgesetz focused on issues that you really don't want to change. in other words, even if only a single 2/3rd vote is necessary to approve a change, a change should be a rare exception.NoiseBert69 1 minute ago

on: Human writers have always used the em dash
The only time I used the em dash was when Microsoft word used to automatically add it to something I was typing. Usually it was formally typed stuff like essays and reports. I have never in my life used an em dash for anything else. Usually just a hyphen "-" at most.other8026 2 minutes ago

on: Introduction to GrapheneOS
The basic thing is that the developer had been swatted multiple times right before that video. Swatted by a fan of the YouTubers who made the video that Louis commented on.But the targeted update thing isn't even possible on GrapheneOS. The update server is basically a basic web server. The updates are stored on the servers and the update client downloads them. All update files follow the same naming system and the update client downloads updates using that system.The update client never sends any IDs either.So if GrapheneOS can't get unique IDs, then how can targeting be done? It's just not possible.rarkins 2 minutes ago

I do. I watch scifi shows over the internet with my friends. We watch it together on a web page with an html5 video element served out of my apartment. I've had to re-encode it to 3 megabits per second (to avoid stutter/buffering) with no b-frames. When initially setting it up, I tested both H264 and AV1 at that bitrate and H264 looked considerably worse.qingcharles 3 minutes ago

The complaint was that the post has a lot of basic inconsistencies which is a problem regardless.If your content is as bad as AI slop it doesn't really matter if it is or not, but I think it's safe to assume that when a verbose and grandiose post is internally inconsistent and was written after 2022, it's slop[0]0 https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/f0e/0bb/d9346e02d8d7173a6a9d...More
