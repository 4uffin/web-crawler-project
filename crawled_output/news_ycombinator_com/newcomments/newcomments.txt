I once had the distinct pleasure of hosting the author of BWA (R. Durbin) at Google, and pointing out "That's Mike Burrows, over there, next to Jeff Dean and Sanjay Ghemawat".
That led to an interesting discussion between Durbin and Dean on DNA sequence compression.
It's not the first time I've been in a room with a bunch of geniuses and simply kept my mouth shut so nobody would know I'm an idiot.bmurphy1976 0 minutes ago

>> disks are not considered "slow devices".
> And neither are the tapes. But the pipes, apparently, are.The "slow vs fast" language is really unfortunate IMHO, I realize it's traditional but it's unnecessarily confusing.A better way to conceptualize it IMHO is bounded vs unbounded: a file or a tape contains a fixed amount of data known a priori, a socket or a pipe does not.Wowfunhappy 0 minutes ago

There's also a skewed distribution for fraud-vulnerable users and scenarios.But if my goal was to commit fraud, wouldn't I go to wherever it was easiest to commit fraud? The actual market penetration of each platform shouldn't matter.testrun 0 minutes ago

on: PlugAndData – plug‑and‑play data pipeline with aut...
Hi HN,I wanted to share PlugAndData, a tool we built to close the gap between code and data.
By combining the concept of a database and a data pipeline into a single tool, data storage and interfaces can be managed automatically: no external database schema to be maintained anymore, no more object-relational mappers nor database queries. Just write code and run it, even scaled across multiple machines or with human-in-the-loop.
The user interface follows this typical visual programming approach where the user drags in nodes and connects them. There are data, function and query nodes.
An interesting detail is that we have modelled hashing/memoization simply as another node. By giving the hashing node both an input and an output port which you can connect or disconnect independently any time, hashing becomes flexible. For example, you may decide to override some hashed results by connecting only the input port while processing a given batch of data.We built PlugAndData because we saw the challenge for small and mid‑sized teams of juggling with multiple tools from databases over orchestrators to containerization.I’d love to hear the community’s thoughts on the concept, we are still in the early pilot phase.
There is a also a 4 minutes demo video on the site (we integrated an LLM, which makes for a nice demo but is not seen as the core benefit/selling point by us).Looking forward to feedback!nixosbestos 1 minute ago

Threads like this want me to throw my laptop into a volcano and lobotomize myself. I have a bridge if you think an LLM can reliably generically redact passwords.
Especially given the intersection of password quality and the type of person to let their passwords leak into output of a recorded terminal session.I love leaving my baseline security in the hands of a hallucinating, unreliable token generator.chr15m 1 minute ago

For one approach to compressing FASTQ (which is a series 3 distinct lines), we broke the distinct lines each into their own streams and then compressed each stream independently.
That way the coder for the header line, sequence line, and error line could learn the model of that specific line type and get slightly better compression (not unlike a columnar format, although in this case, we simply combined "blocks" of streams together with a record separator.I'm still pretty amazed that periodic newlines hurt compression ratios so much, given the compressor can use both a huffman coding and a lookback dictionary.The best rule in sequence data storage is to store as little of it as possible.Waterluvian 2 minutes ago

I actually read the article you linked and these are clearly just shopkeepers breaking the law, lying about these being compliant. There is no legal loophole, except if you count a lack of enforcement as a loophole.greyface- 3 minutes ago

on: Why do software developers love complexity?
Why do some folks love assuming walking backwards to the past is the only reasonable path?> The simple alternative is just around the corner: sprinkle vanilla JavaScript where it’s needed and don’t build your identity around a framework. That mindset is hard to swallow, though (especially when companies have spent millions convincing developers their stack is the only way forward).Having grown up doing webdev at its emergence, those were not glorious years.Even as a solo developer or part of a small time, it was hard as hell to have a perfect mental image of the app at all times, to understand all the combinatorial possibilities of what state your app is in now and what state you want to head to next.Trying to forever update retained state is hard as hell, full of incredible opportunity for memory leaks, and created some super weird behaviors.Even more so, "just write the basic code" doesn't scale. It's not a system that an org can follow. Folks will come and go, each going totally different directions. I don't know how to stress how immature and insane this sounds.But folks love trashing that which is popular. To declare oneself the only sane mind amid a sea of madness.I really do hope we see some post-React eras dawn, see more, that this isn't it, on and on. But I respect like hell the switch from a retained mode form of webdev to an immediate mode one. It doesn't just skip by so many really bad failure modes, it's often far far faster than the poor incomplete hacked out vanilla.js solution your org ended up with. I want us to change to move to not be stuck here. But to see where we are as unnecessary complexity, to invent fantastic degrading tales about the weak souls of men for getting us here: this is truly the behavior imo of lowlifes, of those spreading propoganda to spread the thinnest false confidence of hatred and disdain against the world.Things are complex and that's ok. We are learning. The way out in onwards not idolizing a concocted naive pastoralized past.viraptor 4 minutes ago

In addition to the headline, this bill would also criminalize such popular movies as Hairspray, Mrs. Doubtfire, and Tootsie, for which Dustin Hoffman won a Golden Globe. (And quite obviously a fair bit of music videos and general entertainment industry content would also become illegal.)>> The bill also includes a section that takes aim at transgender individuals by prohibiting material "that includes a disconnection between biology and gender by an individual of 1 biological sex imitating, depicting, or representing himself or herself to be of the other biological sex."MaxGripe 5 minutes ago

on: Cox: 'Social media is a cancer on our society '
Some might feel compelled here to point out that Cox has social media accounts.I would like to urge anyone with this idea to reconsider. Such a gotcha does not prove what you think it does. Cox is clearly attempting to resist the negative effects he attributes to social media, and I imagine that government officials are required to hold them anyway (if only so that they can be "verified" and impostors don't get to steal the stage).Cox's current pinned tweet states that> Disagreement is part of democracy. Violence must never be.and quotes Kirk saying> What we as a culture have to get back to, is being able to have reasonable agreement where violence is not an option.To me this seems laudable.otterley 5 minutes ago
