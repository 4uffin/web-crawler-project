on: The awe keeps dropping
Reading the criticism, I just came to a completely opposite conclusion regarding the magsafe battery: is the iPhone Air the answer to the people complaining about no removable battery? Make the body thinner, still waterproof, and you can have multiple “external” batteries to clip on. Boom, battery life is “infinite”.nixpulvis 0 minutes ago

yeah, at some point every apple fanboy comes to the realization that the company isn't some magical force doing revolutionary things, they're just another tech company making consumer products.
some of them are good, some of them are mediocre, all of them are designed to evoke an emotional response to extract more money from your wallet than the product is probably worth.there's two responses to that realization: "oh, apple has lost it's way, this is the beginning of the end" or "oh, i was a bit silly for thinking apple was so special".
the essays with no self-awareness are a bit tiresome.MangoToupe 0 minutes ago

on: The 12-Month Bug: Why Your Side Project Is Still J...
That’s the sweet spot, honestly. It’s less about whether an LLM can crank out scaffolding faster than someone fluent in JavaScript and more about what it unlocks: the ability to collapse “thinking about it for months” into “there’s a thing I can actually click/play with.”That’s the core of what I was trying to name with the 12-month bug: our tendency to loop in abstraction long after execution could’ve started. Doesn’t matter if the code’s rough; the point is you crossed the boundary. From there, the real operating system is iteration.If it’s useful, I wrote a companion post called Stuck Theory: Resistance as Fitness Function. Similar~ish meta-conclusion. For me the blog as a whole is a running attempt to debug how we keep pushing dense, sometimes unwieldy information down our own neural pathways while AI is gradually offloading the lighter parts of cognition.

What was the scifi-story where they explored some planet with electric helicopters. They had several hectars on thinfilm solar panels, which they spread on the fields every other day. This does not sound Scifi at all now.xadhominemx 1 minute ago

on: Linux phones are more important now than ever
I fully think an amazing consumer-targetting device could take over like a storm if done well, if ambitiously done, with an aggressive software stack.But. I think what we should ask for now should be simpler. Let this be an alpha geek toy, let folks fiddle with some basic devices boards that can do the thing. The work on PinePhone, Mobia , others is good pioneering work, alas largely held back by there just being so few decent devices for folks to play with. The driver situation keeps making hope here impossible.It's not a high hope, but Qualcomm has a QCM6490 chip is maybe a rare hope. A chip that is somewhat buyable by regular makers, an extended life version of the Snapdragon 778G. It's pretty modern, and comes with very festureful connectivity hardware. We're seeing variants like non-cellular Radxa Dragon Q6A in the field. Particle has a new Tachyon board you can buy with it. https://www.cnx-software.com/2024/07/31/tachyon-business-car...It's just stunningly rare alas that folks can make systems with vaguely modern cellular chips. The cores are just not available generally. Sure it's be great to have a well produced Linux phone that is super consumer acceptable with a great OS build out, a new Maemo or a Jolla Sailfish: folks who can go sign the NDAs and make a consumer device but have it be Linux. But I think for this dream to really take hold, humanity needs to be afforded some possibility to have an honest shake, some chance to be a little closer to the machine than typical cellphone bargain. The lack of cellular chip availability has been so so damning to this quest. And here is one counter-example, a crack in the wall, where I see flowers and hope grow.There was some real nice moments where it seemed like maybe some Snapdragon cellphones in general we're getting Linux support to some level, in mainline, just for the base stuff. No cellular. Unclear to me but it seems like maybe those were just the very barest of beginnings; whether any peripherals at all work or whether there was even a screen is unclear. The trickle of releases also seems to have died off. FWIW though, I will note the previous Fairphone 5 does use the above QCM6490. https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-6.1-Arm-Hardwarejacobolus 1 minute ago

> A modular iphone that has an easy to replace battery, easy to replace screen and is maybe 2mm thicker to account for it? That would be a sellout.No it wouldn't. This theoretical advantage would only appreciated by a trivially small proportion of customers, but the trade offs required (the phone would be more expensive, fatter, less robust, have less water resistance, etc.) would make the device significantly worse for everyone else.> convertible Macbook Air with a touch screenThis would suck, just like the comparable Windows/Linux devices that have tried it already. Touchscreens don't work well with software is not designed for them. Just getting developer adoption of the 'touchbar' was apparently a bridge too far, let alone a fully supported alternative UI for every app. What would be nice is more investment of attention and effort by Apple in the Mac operating system and software, using the traditional user interface, which is already very effective for the tasks people use it for.> Neckband-style airpodsNo idea what this is, but sounds like a niche market, probably already adequately addressed by existing products from other compananies.> best-in-class TVWhat's wrong with TVs that already exist? Why would Apple be able to do better. Sounds like a low-margin product with limited market. (They have surely already considered this in depth and decided not to do it.)> cannibalize salesI doubt it.faangguyindia 1 minute ago

> What really got on my nerves during the Apple Watch segment of the event, though, is this: Apple always, always inserts a montage of sob stories about how the Apple Watch has saved lives, and what an indispensable life-saving device it is. Don’t get me wrong, I’m glad those lives were saved. But this kind of ‘showcase’ every year is made in such poor taste. It’s clear to me that it’s all marketing above everything else, that they just want to sell the product, and these people’s stories end up being used as a marketing tactic. It’s depressing.Yeah, the trauma porn in Apple events has become quite annoying. We get it - if you don't have an Apple watch you're going to die.IAmGraydon 2 minutes ago

on: Pyret: A Programming Language for Education
This is great, but even browsers go nutty at times. I had to restart Firefox (as in kill-restart), when it lost contact with the keyboard. No, not an iPad case. That just drops the keyboard now and then for fun and I detach it and re-attach it. I'll go clean the contacts shortly.Anyway, just a minor, and hopefully a non-point.

A foldable iPhone has been pretty firmly rumored for fall 2026 for a while now, I think you can take it as virtually certain: https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/I don't think the Air is merely a precursor to the foldable, however. It's rather that the technological evolution that allowed for the 5mm thin iPad Pro last year allows for the Air this year and helps with the foldable next year (and thinner MacBooks are rumored as well). But the Air is probably there to stay as a separate form factor, assuming that it doesn't flop in terms of sales. The foldable will be much heavier and bulkier, more resembling a Pro Max.austin-cheney 3 minutes ago

on: Framework Reveals Upgradable Laptop GPU
People base purchases on more than price. But on price you are essentially correct. They are a money pit if you want to upgrade them and it is often possible to get much better value for money shopping around and this applies throughout Framework's range. Even going DIY on SSD and RAM the other components aren't cheap.They don't have the manufacturing volumes to compete on price so they compete on appeals to sustainability, repairability etc. It is why I bought one a few years ago and I still use it but I haven't take advantage of any of the upgrades that have been available.halosghost 4 minutes ago
