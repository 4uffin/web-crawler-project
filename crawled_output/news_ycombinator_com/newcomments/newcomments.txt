> > but that doesn't mean we should just delete everything.> Where did this come from? This has nothing to do with anything.Poor wording on my part, because I was typing on my phone. "Everything" refers to everything related to copyright law. Your original comment implied that we should just burn it all down (going "as far as possible to the other side"), and I don't agree with that.Copyright has been weaponized of course, but there are considerations worth keeping in mind about why it exists in the first place. The intent is to create mechanisms that incentivize creation of art, and allow creatives to distribute said art without other people getting automatic ownership of the fruits of their labor, just by virtue of having the file.In a world where distribution of media is (relatively) cheap and easy, we need to think more about how we incentivize the creative process, instead of making it a wild west where anyone is allowed to distribute if they have the bits on them. In a world where everyone pirates, very little worth pirating remains.MengerSponge 0 minutes ago

Exactly. Like... what are they even saying here - that if the connection drops then it falls back to a tiny "dropped on their head as a child" 4b parameter LLM embedded in the physical firmware and so that's why it is giving inane responses? Give me a break.Mad props to the presenter for holding it together though.SigmaEpsilonChi 1 minute ago

My A1 has lots of annoying issues. It did print great out of the box, but requires a fair bit of maintenance to keep that up.My prusa has be far more reliable so far. admittedly it’s newer than the a1 so it’s too early to be super conclusive on that, but so far it’s been quite a bit betterOf course, it’s quite a bit more money toozmmmmm 1 minute ago

> Either way it suggests some troubling early implications about how well Meta's AI work is goingI fully expect the AI to suck initially and then over many months of updates evolve to mostly annoying and only occasionally mildly useful.However, the demo failing isn't necessarily supporting evidence. Live stage demos involving Wifi are just hard because in addition to the normal device functionality they're demoing, they need to simultaneously compress and transmit a screen share of the final output over wifi so the audience can see it. And they have to do all that in a highly challenging RF environment that's basically impossible to simulate in advance. Frankly, I'd be okay with them using a special headset that has a hard-wired data link for the stage demo.vjjsejj 1 minute ago

> next to someone who thinks that it's ok to commit acts of violence against others just because we don't share the same views.But that still only includes a subset of views?I mean what you are saying is right. But these people were perfectly fine with ignoring or sometimes outright endorsing political violence until one of their own was the target. That does not seem extremely hypocritical?jmb99 2 minutes ago

on: Apple Photos app corrupts images
> Why? If your app is used by billions of people, surely you can afford a few additional testers and engineers?Unfortunately, in the real world, # of bugs solved per unit time does not scale linearly with # of developers - and, you eventually reach enough people that you can't effectively coordinate changes without wasting more time on processes than you're gaining by adding another person.I've never worked at Apple and I don't know anyone on the Photos team, but I imagine a company at that scale probably has a good idea as to the optimal number of developers working on one application. Optimal to Apple probably involves optimal money spent:money earned ratio, not most bugs fixed per unit time, but I would wager those numbers are pretty similar anyways.seattle_spring 2 minutes ago

Hard agree on terrible. I guess i'd have disabled the no connectivity message for the demo to give it a chance to reconnect gracefully/quickly if at all (by non stop querying even without wifi) but that's just guessing on my part. I think they're garbage and same for meta, if that needs sayingggregoire 2 minutes ago

> for example imagine playing a Magic the Gathering (or similar) card game, and watching your cards come to life on the board in hologram-esque 3DThis is the kind of thing that buries VR ideas. It's very cute in a demo, but as an actual product, the cost of coming up with 3D models and animations for all MTG cards currently being played is many orders of magnitude more than the total number of people who would pay for this. Ultimately this is completely unnecessary fluff for the game, like chess games where the pieces actually fight: irrelevant, and it actually detracts from the game because it interrupts the flow of what you're actually doing.kashunstva 3 minutes ago

on: U.S. sees 5.7M more childless women than expected
> neither would look at 2016 or 2020 or 2024 and decide "never mind" on their life-long commitment to family. And neither would anyone else.My wife and I are not conservative; but I would agree that no one is tracking the election results as a go/no-go indicator for child-rearing. My wife and I have 3 children, two of whom are adults so our decisions were made in a different era. Instead of bipolar political outcomes, I think many are affected by a sense of unchanging disinterest in the wellbeing of the great mass of people that populate the country. As long as the GDP rises, it’s good times, right? Few on either side of the political divide want to talk about the distribution of U.S. national income. Want more kids? Make life less difficult for families. Both major parties have completely failed to do this.frosting1337 3 minutes ago

My argument is New Deal policies paved the way, both institutionally and legislatively, for it to happen. So yes, it could have happened in more centrist regimes entering the war, but there would be significantly more friction.alexjplant 4 minutes ago

on: A QBasic Text Adventure Still Expanding in 2025
QBasic was my first programming language. I wrote an "operating system" called QWIN using it when I was 7 years old. It had a fake POST with a rising tone and some atonal beeps followed by a series of unnecessary pauses and prompts before getting to a text-based shell (you read that right - QWIN had no windows) which was a pile of spaghetti driven by IFs and GOTOs with arbitrary labels. I was afraid of GOSUB and loops of all types so the embedded unlicensed Pokemon text adventure was nothing more than a series of fleshed-out decision trees until you reached the end. My screensaver that drew random lines used a static seed for the RNG so it was the same every time. Fun times.My best good friend still has a copy of it someplace on a floppy disk because we would run it on the computer that he put together out of spare parts on a piece of plywood. Thankfully he has a family and is too busy to dig it up and send it to me so I'm spared the embarrassment that would come with seeing it.I'm always happy to see projects like this and OHRRPGCE where people did something useful with the language.lmz 4 minutes ago

on: UUIDv47: Store UUIDv7 in DB, emit UUIDv4 outside (...
This scheme potentially leaks timestamp, serialisation, and record-correlation data because the specification of UUIDv7 allows for partial timestamps and incrementing counters in the so-called random bits, which are passed through undisturbed.So it is not generally fit for that purpose either.solid_fuel 4 minutes ago

Meta locked two games I already paid for - Blade & Sorcery VR and Beat Saber - behind account verification on the Quest 2.
I already bought both of these, played them for a while, but now it won't let me use the headset without "verifying" my facebook account by sending them a photograph of my drivers license.
Neither of these games are online, neither allow me to interact with other users in any way.I will never buy a Meta product again, the brand reputation is lower than dirt to me.
Even ignoring all the other awful things Meta does, they have no reason to require a verified account to play two local-only games that I already paid for.
No matter how cool glasses like these may look, I have no trust that the brand will not suddenly demand more money or information from me to continue using a product I have already purchased.dav43 5 minutes ago

on: UUIDv47: Store UUIDv7 in DB, emit UUIDv4 outside (...
Why does it use version 4 instead of version 8? Version 4 implies that it's random bits, but it's actually not random. Version 8 doesn't imply anything about what the bits mean.More
