Congrats - there is a very small problem with the LLM - its reusing transformer blocks and you want to use different instances of them.Its a very cool excercise, I did the same with Zig and MLX a while back, so I can get a nice foundation, but since then as I got hooked and kept adding stuff to it, switched to Pytorch/Transformers.fireflash38 0 minutes ago

For casual bakers, exact precision using grams can help... Or it might not matter at all. You'd need to have everything else be as precise for it to matter. Are you weighing your eggs? Do you adjust based on the humidity of the air? Do you know all of the hot spots in your oven and is the thermometer accurate?It's science, but ya gotta realize you arent baking a sphere in a vacuum ya know?GardenLetter27 0 minutes ago

An important nuance here is that LUCA doesn't really imply there was only that one organism. There could be more organisms, it's just the one that we can trace, similar to mitochondrial Eve (see the "popular reception" section): https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrial_Eveblackcatsec 2 minutes ago

An assumption I disagree with wholeheartedly. People say and do even more heinous shit in person all the time. You yourself said your locals have become more aggressive. Do you think that if we were like, "Hey, if you wanna continue to talk shit, you have to tell us your name" they'll just be like "oh okay you know what you're right I was wrong I love minorities" or do you think they'll just become even more aggressive? Do you think that'll lead to more understanding between people? Or just more violence against minorities?dmboyd 2 minutes ago

on: A qualitative analysis of pig-butchering scams
It was a pretty wild ride, for an arvix paper lol. Easily as good as a provocative work of fiction, It had me questioning my marriage briefly until I rolled over and looked at my toddler, and briefly thought “holy shirt this runs deep!” (And then obviously broke out of the spell of the story lol)Still, it’s a testament to the level of emotional damage that these scams must levy on their actual victims.DoneWithAllThat 2 minutes ago

I have baking recipes from my great-grandmother (circa 1890) that direct the baker to use "a medium fire".
They were later annotated in my grandmother's handwriting with temperatures (in Fahrenheit).jaza 3 minutes ago

on: Folks, we have the best π
Errr... a circle is a shape in Euclidean geometry. Pi is a property of that shape in that geometry system. The OP article steps outside of Euclidean geometry. It discusses "circles" that aren't really circles. Therefore, the "pi's" that it discusses also aren't really pi's.My conclusion therefore isn't "we have the best pi", but is rather "we have the only pi", because pi is simply not applicable, as soon as you alter the rules of there being a 2-dimensional plane and there being real-world distance, that the definition of pi depends on.Anyway, I am not a mathematician, maybe I'm just too stuck in the boring old real world to get it!Anon84 3 minutes ago

That's basically the economic equivalent of having to pay to get rid of a fallen tree despite that tree then going on to be chipped and sold in bulk to whatever the nearest local place buying chips is.The feed stock is basically worth nothing, it's the labor and energy investment that you add to it at every step that adds the value.cmrdporcupine 4 minutes ago

on: Analyzing the memory ordering models of the Apple ...
We are talking about the memory bandwidth available to the CPU cores and not all the co-processors/accelerators present in the SoC so you're pulling in the argument that is not valid.https://web.archive.org/web/20240902200818/https://www.anand...> While 243GB/s is massive, and overshadows any other design in the industry, it’s still quite far from the 409GB/s the chip is capable of.> That begs the question, why does the M1 Max have such massive bandwidth? The GPU naturally comes to mind, however in my testing, I’ve had extreme trouble to find workloads that would stress the GPU sufficiently to take advantage of the available bandwidth.> Granted, this is also an issue of lacking workloads, but for actual 3D rendering and benchmarks, I haven’t seen the GPU use more than 90GB/s (measured via system performance counters)mapt 4 minutes ago

There are several separate problems here.One is "People don't like bags stuck in the branches of trees and clogging waterways in their parks".
Lighweight plastic shopping bags cost approximately nothing - <2 cents retail, less in volume.
It is incredibly expensive by comparison to pay someone to remove them from tree branches and riparian zones.
This is a pragmatic reason why municipalities passed bag taxes or bans. Forcing people to use paper or heavier-weight plastic bags that don't blow in the wind, even if they're not in practice "reusable", solves this one.
Taxing them 5 cents or 10 cents or 25 cents per bag nudges a high percentage away.itsibitzi 4 minutes ago

Sending a .zip filled with all zeroes, so it compresses extremely well, is a well-known DoS historically (zip bomb, making the server run out of space in trying to read the archive)You always need resource limits when dealing with untrusted data. RAM is one of the obvious ones. They could introduce a memory limit parameter; require passing --long with a value equal to or greater than what the stream requires to successfully decompress; require seeking support for the input stream so they can look back that way (TMTO); fall back to using temp files; or interactively prompt the user if there's a terminal attached. Lots of options, each with pros and cons of course, that would all allow a scenario where the required information for the decoder is stored in the compressed data fileimajoredinecon 5 minutes ago

It’s a class/geographical thing. In my early childhood in a fancy suburb of a big city, my parents and people in their social circle used mixes 0% of the time, but when we moved to a smaller town it was way more common.More
