The Women's EuroHockey Indoor Club Cup is an annual indoor hockey club competition organised by the EHF. It is the premier club tournament of Europe for indoor hockey and contested by the women's champions of the eight strongest EHF national associations.
German clubs have the highest number of victories (30 wins), two editions have been won by a Dutch club and Ukrainian clubs have one victory. 12 clubs have won the competition, five of which have won it more than once, and three successfully defended their title. Rüsselsheimer RK is the most successful club in the tournament's history, having won it 15 times, including 13 consecutive titles from 1994 to 2006. Sumchanka are the current European champions, having beaten SCHC in the 2025 final 2–0 in a shoot-out for their first title and the first title for a Ukrainian club.
Format[edit]
A total of eight teams competes in the EuroHockey Indoor Club Cup, the champions of those nations ranked one to six in the previous year's Cup and the champions of those 2 nations promoted from the previous year's Trophy, the second level.[1]
The eight teams are divided into two groups and play each other once. If a game is won, the winning team receives 5 points. A draw results in both teams receiving 2 points. A loss gives the losing team 1 point unless the losing team lost by 3 or more goals, then they receive 0 points.[1] The top two teams advance to the semi-finals and the bottom two teams will be placed in pool C, the relegation pool. Each team in Pool C will carry forward the result of the match against that other team in their original pool (A or B) who also goes forward with them into Pool C. Each team will play the other 2 teams in Pool C once. The bottom two teams in pool C are relegated.[1]
