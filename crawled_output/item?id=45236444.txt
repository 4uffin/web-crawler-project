It would be interesting to set up an http/https server on an alternate port, as documented in section 7.2, and see how many connections it gets.
Of course you would need a control using some other http/https server on an undocumented port, so you could tell the difference between connections from port scanners vs. DNS lookups.Assuming you're running your own DNS server, you could also check the logs to see how many queries you get for the "port" SvcParamKey.My guess is it will be a very small number.replyaltairprime 3 hours ago
