Many of the Cookies placed through our Site are session Cookies, while others are persistent Cookies, and some are “first-party” Cookies, while others are “third-party” Cookies. First-party Cookies are those set by a site that is being visited by the user at the time (e.g., Cookies placed by www.edx.org). Third-party Cookies are Cookies that are set by a domain other than that of the site being visited by the user. For example, when a user visits a site and a cookie set on that site by a third-party fires, it transfers information to the user's web browser, where it might be stored or sent back with the next request to the same server. Cookies that are sent through these third-party components are called third-party cookies and are mainly used for advertising and tracking across the web. Persistent Cookies are Cookies that remain on a user’s device for the period of time specified in the cookie. They are activated each time that the user visits the site that created that particular cookie.
