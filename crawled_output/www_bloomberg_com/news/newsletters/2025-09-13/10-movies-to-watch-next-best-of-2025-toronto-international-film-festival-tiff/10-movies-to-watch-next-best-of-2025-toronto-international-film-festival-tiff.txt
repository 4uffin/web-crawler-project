I’m Esther Zuckerman, a movie critic for Pursuits. I just spent the past week up north at the Toronto International Film Festival, which runs through Sunday and is the midway point of the busy season for premieres of movies that hope to win an Oscar.The marathon kicks off in August with the Venice International Film Festival, which overlaps with Telluride over Labor Day weekend.
