That beat all estimates in a Bloomberg survey of economists. Excluding cars, sales climbed 0.7%. Nine out of 13 categories posted increases, led by online retailers, clothing stores and sporting goods, likely reflecting back-to-school shopping.Though wage growth has cooled, many workers’ pay gains continue to outpace inflation. Other consumers, particularly the wealthy, are benefiting from a stock market rally.Still, another economic report on Tuesday reinforced that manufacturing has largely struggled to gain its footing in recent months as uncertainty around President Donald Trump’s trade policy has dampened capital spending. US industrial production barely rose in August, reflecting a modest gain in manufacturing activity and a decline in utilities.—Jordan Parker ErbHomeBTV+Market DataOpinionAudioOriginalsMagazineEventsNewsMarketsEconomicsTechnologyPoliticsGreenCryptoAIWork & LifeWealthPursuitsBusinessweekCityLabSportsEqualityManagement & WorkMarket DataStocksCommoditiesRates & BondsCurrenciesFuturesSectorsEconomic CalendarExploreNewslettersExplainersPointed News QuizThe Big TakeGraphicsSubmit a TipAbout UsTerms of ServiceDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationTrademarksPrivacy PolicyCareersMade in NYCAdvertiseAd ChoicesHelp©2025 Bloomberg L.P.
