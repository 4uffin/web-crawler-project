Philadelphia is on track to lose almost half its transit service in the next year. The Chicago area could lose over a third. The Portland, Oregon, area could eventually lose a quarter of its bus service and a tenth of its rail service. Those are just some of the cuts we can see now, in debates in those states’ legislatures. Next year, voters in several states will probably be asked to raise new funding to save their transit systems, forestalling what could otherwise be serious cuts in many cities.
