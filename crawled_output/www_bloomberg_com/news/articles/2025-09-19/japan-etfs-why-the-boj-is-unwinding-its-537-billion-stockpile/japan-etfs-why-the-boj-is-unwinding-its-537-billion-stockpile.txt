As of mid-September, the BOJ held about ¥79.5 trillion ($537 billion) of ETFs by market value and had around ¥43.8 trillion of unrealized gains, according to calculations by Morgan Stanley MUFG strategists. Reducing its stockpile of ETFs — funds that aim to match the performance of a basket of assets or a specific index — would help the BOJ to start to look more like a normal central bank. It’s entering a new era after decades of unconventional monetary policy to combat deflation, which included buying ETFs to stimulate the economy.HomeBTV+Market DataOpinionAudioOriginalsMagazineEventsNewsMarketsEconomicsTechnologyPoliticsGreenCryptoAIWork & LifeWealthPursuitsBusinessweekCityLabSportsEqualityManagement & WorkMarket DataStocksCommoditiesRates & BondsCurrenciesFuturesSectorsEconomic CalendarExploreNewslettersExplainersPointed News QuizThe Big TakeGraphicsSubmit a TipAbout UsTerms of ServiceDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationTrademarksPrivacy PolicyCareersMade in NYCAdvertiseAd ChoicesHelp©2025 Bloomberg L.P.
