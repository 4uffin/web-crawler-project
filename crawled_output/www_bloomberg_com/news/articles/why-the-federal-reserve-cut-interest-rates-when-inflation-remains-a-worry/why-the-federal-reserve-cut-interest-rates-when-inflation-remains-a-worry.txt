Arriving at the first rate cut since December involved a tough balancing act for the Fed, which aims to deliver price stability and full employment. Drastic policy shifts by the Trump administration in trade and immigration have brought the two sides of the central bank’s mandate into conflict.Since 1977, Congress has given the Fed a dual mandate: promote both stable prices and maximum employment to help ensure a strong economy. Typically, when prices are rising, the Fed raises rates to ward off further inflation. When joblessness increases, the Fed cuts rates to lower borrowing costs and spur hiring.
