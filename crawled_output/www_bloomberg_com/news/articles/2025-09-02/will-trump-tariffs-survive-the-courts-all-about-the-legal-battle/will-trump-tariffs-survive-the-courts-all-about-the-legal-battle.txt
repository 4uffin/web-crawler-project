The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on Aug. 29 upheld an earlier decision by the US Court of International Trade. Both courts concluded that Trump wrongfully invoked an emergency law, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), to justify the duties — a rare rebuke as the courts tend to defer to the president on trade matters.The appeals court allowed the tariffs to remain in place at least through Oct. 14 to give the Trump administration time to make a final appeal directly to the Supreme Court, which it has said it will do. The appeals court also said the trade court should revisit its decision to block the relevant tariffs for everyone, rather than just the parties who filed suit.HomeBTV+Market DataOpinionAudioOriginalsMagazineEventsNewsMarketsEconomicsTechnologyPoliticsGreenCryptoAIWork & LifeWealthPursuitsBusinessweekCityLabSportsEqualityManagement & WorkMarket DataStocksCommoditiesRates & BondsCurrenciesFuturesSectorsEconomic CalendarExploreNewslettersExplainersPointed News QuizThe Big TakeGraphicsSubmit a TipAbout UsTerms of ServiceDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationTrademarksPrivacy PolicyCareersMade in NYCAdvertiseAd ChoicesHelp©2025 Bloomberg L.P.
