The podcast was launched around the time the South Africa native bought and rebranded Twitter, transforming a mainstream social media platform into something else entirely. Now, the podcast has found a natural conclusion with his full return to his companies, his exit from the Trump administration and the unprecedented governmental upheaval, mass firings and grim global consequences left in his wake.To reflect on this tumultuous timeline, David Papadopoulos gathers the best and brightest Elon Musk experts the Bloomberg newsroom has to offer—including Bloomberg Businessweek’s Max Chafkin and Bloomberg News Musk reporter Dana Hull, technology reporter Kurt Wagner and editor Sarah Frier—to go through the most memorable Musk stories from the past few years and to peek into the future of Musk’s empire and potential political ambitions.
