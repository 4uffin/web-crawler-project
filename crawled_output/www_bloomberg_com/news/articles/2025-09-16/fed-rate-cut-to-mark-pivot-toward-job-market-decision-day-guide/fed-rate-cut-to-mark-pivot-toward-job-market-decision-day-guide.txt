The policy pivot will take place amid unrelenting pressure from President Donald Trump, who has pushed for a “big cut” this week. Political drama has also introduced suspense about who would even be in attendance at this week’s policy meeting, though the lineup was likely finalized Monday night when the Senate confirmed a new Fed governor and a late court ruling allowed another official to remain in place for now.HomeBTV+Market DataOpinionAudioOriginalsMagazineEventsNewsMarketsEconomicsTechnologyPoliticsGreenCryptoAIWork & LifeWealthPursuitsBusinessweekCityLabSportsEqualityManagement & WorkMarket DataStocksCommoditiesRates & BondsCurrenciesFuturesSectorsEconomic CalendarExploreNewslettersExplainersPointed News QuizThe Big TakeGraphicsSubmit a TipAbout UsTerms of ServiceDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationTrademarksPrivacy PolicyCareersMade in NYCAdvertiseAd ChoicesHelp©2025 Bloomberg L.P.
