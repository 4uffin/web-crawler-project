The UK has scaled back its goals of bringing the levies on steel to zero, according to a person familiar with the matter, representing a blow to an industry which has been waiting months for the removal of the 25% levy. Instead, British officials expect commitments that tariffs on steel would remain at 25%, said the person, who asked not to be named while discussing a policy change that hasn’t been announced. That’s less than the 50% slapped on other countries’ exports, but still a level that local companies have called damaging.HomeBTV+Market DataOpinionAudioOriginalsMagazineEventsNewsMarketsEconomicsTechnologyPoliticsGreenCryptoAIWork & LifeWealthPursuitsBusinessweekCityLabSportsEqualityManagement & WorkMarket DataStocksCommoditiesRates & BondsCurrenciesFuturesSectorsEconomic CalendarExploreNewslettersExplainersPointed News QuizThe Big TakeGraphicsSubmit a TipAbout UsTerms of ServiceDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationTrademarksPrivacy PolicyCareersMade in NYCAdvertiseAd ChoicesHelp©2025 Bloomberg L.P.
