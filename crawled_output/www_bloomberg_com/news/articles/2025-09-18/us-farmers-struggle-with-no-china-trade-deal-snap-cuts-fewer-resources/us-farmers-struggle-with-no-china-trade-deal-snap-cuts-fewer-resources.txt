As he described to a series of radio hosts from Iowa to Texas the sense of isolation and despondency increasingly affecting the agricultural workforce, he noticed with a jolt that he was describing himself.Winton is the founder of Rural Minds, a not-for-profit group connecting Americans living outside big cities to local mental health resources. He also runs a dairy farm in New York’s Chautauqua County. He’s been overcome by worries about how President Donald Trump’s tariffs would hurt his 100-cow operation, as well as the rural peers he works with every day. “I was feeling very angry. I was feeling very depressed. I was feeling very pessimistic. I just couldn’t believe that we were doing these things to the people that I advocate for,” Winton, 67, says. He’d spent years directing other struggling farmers into care after his 28-year-old nephew died by suicide near the family farm in 2012. So Winton decided in May to start seeing a therapist himself for the first time.HomeBTV+Market DataOpinionAudioOriginalsMagazineEventsNewsMarketsEconomicsTechnologyPoliticsGreenCryptoAIWork & LifeWealthPursuitsBusinessweekCityLabSportsEqualityManagement & WorkMarket DataStocksCommoditiesRates & BondsCurrenciesFuturesSectorsEconomic CalendarExploreNewslettersExplainersPointed News QuizThe Big TakeGraphicsSubmit a TipAbout UsTerms of ServiceDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationTrademarksPrivacy PolicyCareersMade in NYCAdvertiseAd ChoicesHelp©2025 Bloomberg L.P.
