West Texas Intermediate fell 1.4% to settle just below $63 a barrel as traders rolled over positions ahead of the October contract’s expiry next week, adding to choppy trading. Trump said he would meet Jinping on the sidelines of the upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, but there was little publicly said about China’s continued purchase of Russian crude supplies.
