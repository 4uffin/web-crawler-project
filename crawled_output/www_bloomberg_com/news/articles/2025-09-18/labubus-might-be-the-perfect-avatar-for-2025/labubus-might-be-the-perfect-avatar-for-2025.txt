It wasn’t until the past couple of years, however, that fortune truly smiled on these ugly-cute elves — by transforming them into collectible furry toys that then became a globe-spanning cultural phenomenon, with sales this year on track to overtake Barbie’s and exceed $1 billion. The resulting surge in the share price of Pop Mart International Group Ltd., which makes and sells the toys, caused the Hong Kong-based company’s 38-year-old founder, Wang Ning, to became the 12th richest person in China, with a net worth of more than $20 billion.
