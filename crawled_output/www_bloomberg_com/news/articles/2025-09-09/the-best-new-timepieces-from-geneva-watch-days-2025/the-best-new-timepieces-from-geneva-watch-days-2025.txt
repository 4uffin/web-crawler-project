It provides a looser and more client-friendly atmosphere than the more well-established and trade-oriented Watches & Wonders fair in the spring, which is built around retailers and press. Whereas the latter is staged in a massive, hangar-like indoor event space, the former takes place across the hotels and boutiques around Lake Geneva, with visitors and brand representatives meeting in less regimented and more casual circumstances.TAG Heuer CEO Antoine Pin, a co-founder of the end-of-summer event, describes it as “a platform for engagement, visibility and freedom of agenda. Usually, luxury is far away from the clients, but here there is a very close relationship, with very authentic moments.” This year no fewer than 67 brands, from household names to IYKYK indies, were exhibiting, and many of the new releases display a boldness of creativity in the areas of design, technology or both. (The mood regarding tariffs was, generally, cautiously upbeat.)HomeBTV+Market DataOpinionAudioOriginalsMagazineEventsNewsMarketsEconomicsTechnologyPoliticsGreenCryptoAIWork & LifeWealthPursuitsBusinessweekCityLabSportsEqualityManagement & WorkMarket DataStocksCommoditiesRates & BondsCurrenciesFuturesSectorsEconomic CalendarExploreNewslettersExplainersPointed News QuizThe Big TakeGraphicsSubmit a TipAbout UsTerms of ServiceDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationTrademarksPrivacy PolicyCareersMade in NYCAdvertiseAd ChoicesHelp©2025 Bloomberg L.P.
