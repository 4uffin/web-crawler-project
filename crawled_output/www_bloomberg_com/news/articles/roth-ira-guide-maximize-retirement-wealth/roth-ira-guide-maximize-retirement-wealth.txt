But over the years, these savings vehicles have also become a popular choice for wealthier savers and investors hoping to manage future tax bills. The enduring appeal of a Roth retirement account lies in its simple premise: pay taxes today to avoid them tomorrow. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, on which earnings grow tax-free. With US income tax rates near historical lows, a Roth is a hedge against the possibility of higher taxes in the future, and the accounts provide flexibility in controlling one’s tax bracket down the line, said Craig Toberman of Toberman Becker Wealth.1Contact us:Provide news feedback or report an errorConfidential tip?Send a tip to our reportersSite feedback:Take our SurveyNew WindowBefore it’s here, it’s on the Bloomberg TerminalBloomberg Terminal LEARN MOREHomeBTV+Market DataOpinionAudioOriginalsMagazineEventsNewsMarketsEconomicsTechnologyPoliticsGreenCryptoAIWork & LifeWealthPursuitsBusinessweekCityLabSportsEqualityManagement & WorkMarket DataStocksCommoditiesRates & BondsCurrenciesFuturesSectorsEconomic CalendarExploreNewslettersExplainersPointed News QuizThe Big TakeGraphicsSubmit a TipAbout UsTerms of ServiceDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationTrademarksPrivacy PolicyCareersMade in NYCAdvertiseAd ChoicesHelp©2025 Bloomberg L.P.
