West Texas Intermediate fell 0.7% to trade below $64 a barrel after swinging in a roughly $1 range as Trump reiterated a commitment to low oil prices, limiting investors’ conviction that global efforts to squeeze Russian flows will pan out. Washington has signaled that the US wouldn’t follow through with threats to penalize Moscow’s crude unless Europe also acts.
