The Saraji South mine — which BHP owns in a 50:50 venture with Mitsubishi Corp. — will be placed on care and maintenance from November, the company said in a statement on Wednesday. Other assets in the BHP-Mitsubishi Alliance (BMA) portfolio — including Peak Downs and Caval Ridge — will not be affected, a spokesperson added.
