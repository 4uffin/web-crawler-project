But with the effects of tariffs on inflation still uncertain, Powell made clear that Fed officials will face difficult trade-offs in the coming months as they consider whether to keep cutting.HomeBTV+Market DataOpinionAudioOriginalsMagazineEventsNewsMarketsEconomicsTechnologyPoliticsGreenCryptoAIWork & LifeWealthPursuitsBusinessweekCityLabSportsEqualityManagement & WorkMarket DataStocksCommoditiesRates & BondsCurrenciesFuturesSectorsEconomic CalendarExploreNewslettersExplainersPointed News QuizThe Big TakeGraphicsSubmit a TipAbout UsTerms of ServiceDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationTrademarksPrivacy PolicyCareersMade in NYCAdvertiseAd ChoicesHelp©2025 Bloomberg L.P.
