The subscription price of 66.6 kroner represents a 67% discount to Orsted’s closing price on Friday and of 39% to the theoretical ex-rights price — the stock’s estimated value after the issue of new shares. The discount is larger than in other recent raises from utilities firms, analysts from Citigroup Inc. wrote in a note on Monday. Still, the market reaction was relatively muted: the shares fell 2.3% to 195.7 Danish kroner just after 2 p.m. in Copenhagen, bringing its total drop this year to nearly 42%.HomeBTV+Market DataOpinionAudioOriginalsMagazineEventsNewsMarketsEconomicsTechnologyPoliticsGreenCryptoAIWork & LifeWealthPursuitsBusinessweekCityLabSportsEqualityManagement & WorkMarket DataStocksCommoditiesRates & BondsCurrenciesFuturesSectorsEconomic CalendarExploreNewslettersExplainersPointed News QuizThe Big TakeGraphicsSubmit a TipAbout UsTerms of ServiceDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationTrademarksPrivacy PolicyCareersMade in NYCAdvertiseAd ChoicesHelp©2025 Bloomberg L.P.
