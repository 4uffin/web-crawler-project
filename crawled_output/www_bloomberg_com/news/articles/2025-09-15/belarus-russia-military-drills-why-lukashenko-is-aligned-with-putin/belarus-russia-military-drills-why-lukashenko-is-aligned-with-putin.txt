That bond strengthened as Russia waged its war against Ukraine. Longtime President Alexander Lukashenko, who’s been in power since 1994, allowed Belarus to be used as a staging ground for Russia’s military strikes on Ukraine — and a base for its nuclear weapons — while avoiding sending his own troops to take part in the war. This assistance followed Russian President Vladimir Putin bankrolling Lukashenko’s government for many years in return for political loyalty.HomeBTV+Market DataOpinionAudioOriginalsMagazineEventsNewsMarketsEconomicsTechnologyPoliticsGreenCryptoAIWork & LifeWealthPursuitsBusinessweekCityLabSportsEqualityManagement & WorkMarket DataStocksCommoditiesRates & BondsCurrenciesFuturesSectorsEconomic CalendarExploreNewslettersExplainersPointed News QuizThe Big TakeGraphicsSubmit a TipAbout UsTerms of ServiceDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationTrademarksPrivacy PolicyCareersMade in NYCAdvertiseAd ChoicesHelp©2025 Bloomberg L.P.
