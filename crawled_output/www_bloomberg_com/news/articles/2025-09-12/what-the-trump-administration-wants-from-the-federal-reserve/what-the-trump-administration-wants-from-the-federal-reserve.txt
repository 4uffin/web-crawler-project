The White House wants the central bank to bolster MAGA-nomics by bringing down borrowing costs, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has urged Chair Jerome Powell to be more “imaginative,” even calling for a “revamp” of the Fed itself. One key candidate to replace Powell, former Fed official Kevin Warsh, has gone further, arguing for a new Treasury-Fed accord to replace the 1951 deal that shaped central bank independence.Trump now has the biggest opening in decades to exert influence over the Fed, and he’s approaching it like a revolutionary. It’s at least possible that he will be able to secure a majority on the Fed’s seven-member board of governors, including nominating the next chair. He wants to fire Lisa Cook, a Biden appointee, but so far a lower court has blocked that effort, meaning she’ll probably vote at next week’s rate-setting meeting. But she’ll likely be joined by Stephen Miran, who is set to be on leave as chair of the White House’s Council of Economic Advisers to fill a short-term seat — an appointment that marks the closest ties between the White House and the Fed in nearly 90 years.HomeBTV+Market DataOpinionAudioOriginalsMagazineEventsNewsMarketsEconomicsTechnologyPoliticsGreenCryptoAIWork & LifeWealthPursuitsBusinessweekCityLabSportsEqualityManagement & WorkMarket DataStocksCommoditiesRates & BondsCurrenciesFuturesSectorsEconomic CalendarExploreNewslettersExplainersPointed News QuizThe Big TakeGraphicsSubmit a TipAbout UsTerms of ServiceDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationTrademarksPrivacy PolicyCareersMade in NYCAdvertiseAd ChoicesHelp©2025 Bloomberg L.P.
