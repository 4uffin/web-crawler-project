As part of the restructuring, the ChatGPT owner intends to form a “public benefit corporation” that’s meant to be more appealing to investors. The overall business would continue to be overseen by OpenAI’s nonprofit entity, which would receive an equity stake of more than $100 billion in the new corporation.
