In certain mid-century American and British circles, these preemptive dentures were considered a prudent rite of passage.This is just one example of humanity’s centuries-long quest to recreate lost or malfunctioning body parts, and one of many chronicled in Mary Roach’s Replaceable You: Adventures in Human Anatomy (W.W. Norton, Sept. 16). The popular science writer’s ninth book is part cautionary tale — an appropriate subtitle might be “a history of terrible ideas” — and part celebration of all that modern medicine has achieved.HomeBTV+Market DataOpinionAudioOriginalsMagazineEventsNewsMarketsEconomicsTechnologyPoliticsGreenCryptoAIWork & LifeWealthPursuitsBusinessweekCityLabSportsEqualityManagement & WorkMarket DataStocksCommoditiesRates & BondsCurrenciesFuturesSectorsEconomic CalendarExploreNewslettersExplainersPointed News QuizThe Big TakeGraphicsSubmit a TipAbout UsTerms of ServiceDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationTrademarksPrivacy PolicyCareersMade in NYCAdvertiseAd ChoicesHelp©2025 Bloomberg L.P.
