The town is home to the Budshishiyya order, a centuries-old Sufi Muslim group that claims millions of followers in Morocco and around the world. Typically, there’s a grand religious ceremony, a book fair and a vast market selling locally-produced goods, as well as a conference on Sufi Islam; last time around, one discussion centered on the role of faith in the age of AI. Visitors also flock to a green-domed shrine where three former leaders of the order are buried.HomeBTV+Market DataOpinionAudioOriginalsMagazineEventsNewsMarketsEconomicsTechnologyPoliticsGreenCryptoAIWork & LifeWealthPursuitsBusinessweekCityLabSportsEqualityManagement & WorkMarket DataStocksCommoditiesRates & BondsCurrenciesFuturesSectorsEconomic CalendarExploreNewslettersExplainersPointed News QuizThe Big TakeGraphicsSubmit a TipAbout UsTerms of ServiceDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationTrademarksPrivacy PolicyCareersMade in NYCAdvertiseAd ChoicesHelp©2025 Bloomberg L.P.
