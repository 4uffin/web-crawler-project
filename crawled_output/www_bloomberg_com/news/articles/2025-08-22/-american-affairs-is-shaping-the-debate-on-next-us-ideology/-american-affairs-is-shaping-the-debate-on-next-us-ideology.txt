But inside, you might read Slavoj Žižek, the radical Marxist thinker and cultural critic, exploring censorship and the “Me Too” movement through the comedic works of the classic Hollywood filmmaker Ernst Lubitsch. Or a business consultant and a money manager calling for an end to the “hoarding economy,” in which the wealthy accumulate riches and power at the expense of the middle class. On the journal’s website, left-leaning antitrust activist Matt Stoller explores how corporate monopolies bully and humiliate ordinary Americans, with everything from long customer-service wait times to employee non-compete clauses.HomeBTV+Market DataOpinionAudioOriginalsMagazineEventsNewsMarketsEconomicsTechnologyPoliticsGreenCryptoAIWork & LifeWealthPursuitsBusinessweekCityLabSportsEqualityManagement & WorkMarket DataStocksCommoditiesRates & BondsCurrenciesFuturesSectorsEconomic CalendarExploreNewslettersExplainersPointed News QuizThe Big TakeGraphicsSubmit a TipAbout UsTerms of ServiceDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationTrademarksPrivacy PolicyCareersMade in NYCAdvertiseAd ChoicesHelp©2025 Bloomberg L.P.
