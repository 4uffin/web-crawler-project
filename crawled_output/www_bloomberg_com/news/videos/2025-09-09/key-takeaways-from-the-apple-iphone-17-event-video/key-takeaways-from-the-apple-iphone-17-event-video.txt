Live on Bloomberg TVCC-TranscriptOpenClose00:00Out that Apple shares also continuing to move lower in the after hours trade
after dropping about one and a half percent during the Cass session.
This after the company introduced its new iPhone lineup, as well as
smartwatches and an updated version of its AirPods.
Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, the managing editor of Consumer Tech, told us what to
expect. And Mark, we guess I guess we got what
we were expecting. When you look at the presentation, how
it was rolled out and how they sort of pitched these devices.
Where do you think the uptake is going to potentially be by the consumer when
they're finally able to get their hands on them?
Well, I thought it was a very cohesive keynote.
I think they did a really good job from a marketing perspective, trying to get
people interested in this new iPhone air.
You know, the iPhone here has a series of drawbacks that make it pretty
impractical for the modern smartphone user.
One back camera, mediocre battery life, No speakers on the bottom is just that
one speaker in the earpiece. So this is not a phone that people
should be going out and buying to replace their high end iPhones, their
high end Samsung phones, you name it. But they pitched it as the future.
They pitched it as something super cool to have.
And so they're not really positioning this much differently than the MacBook
Air originally 20 years ago. And I think it's going to drum up some
sales. But really, from a practical standpoint,
I think the pros are where it's at this year.
For me personally, I think the new iPhone 17 pro max is really hot.
6 hours of battery life boost, the iPhone 16 pro and the 15 pro before it.
They have this titanium frame that dissipates heat terribly.
It can overheat in your hand. They finally fix that with this new 17
pro model. I love the new orange color.
The deep blue looks cool. So I think these new pro phones are
going to do extraordinarily well in the holiday season.
iPhone 17 comes in at $800, no price hike.
So, so far, so good from what I'm seeing on these new phones.
No price hike. That might explain some of the share
reaction, Mark, but I want to talk a little bit about the AirPods Pro three.
You actually saw Duolingo shares at one point drop 5% after we got some details
that this model will have live translation capabilities.
Duolingo shares did ultimately recover, but talk us through what we learned
there. Yes.
So we reported about six months ago that these live translation features are
coming. I think they're going to be quite
useful. The way it works essentially, is if two
people who speak different languages are wearing the AirPods and they speak to
each other, they'll hear each other, but in their native tongue.
So that is pretty nifty. Samsung, Google have had these features
for a while. Apple introduced these features on their
phones and other devices actually in June as part of iOS and Ipados 26.
So this is not entirely new. This is sort of the AirPods ification of
it. The bigger thing is actually the heart
rate sensor, because now you're pushing more people in the Apple ecosystem
towards fitness. They have the $10 a month fitness plus
subscription. This could get people hooked on the
fitness idea and heart rate functionality, maybe push them to
eventually upgrade to a price your Apple Watch.
So I think overall, a pretty substantial and nifty upgrade, I should say, to the
AirPods Pro. And then also who can forget the Apple
watches. First end to end revamped to the line in
three years the Apple watch SC at 250 bucks gets a really great upgrade better
display quality some new health features the ultra which I've already pre-ordered
satellite connectivity. So if you are lost in the wilderness or
you like to go hiking like I do and leave your phone behind in the car,
you'll be able to reach emergency services from your watch.
Yeah. And then you have hypertension detection
coming actually backdated to Apple watches from two years ago over a 30 day
period. Can let you know if it senses that you
have high blood pressure. Well, I run straight into the woods and
I don't look back, so I don't need the satellite features.
But I'm excited for you, Mark. I know it's been a busy day.
That is Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, of course, reporting live on Apple's big
hardware day.For YouLive TVNOW PLAYINGKey Takeaways From the Apple iPhone 17 Event51:30Trump Says US Struck 2nd Venezuelan Drug Vessel | Balance of Power: Late Edition 9/15/202505:48Poland’s No-Fly Zone Proposal ‘A Good One’: Daalder08:18Hope ‘Fair Result’ Comes From China Talks: Rep.
