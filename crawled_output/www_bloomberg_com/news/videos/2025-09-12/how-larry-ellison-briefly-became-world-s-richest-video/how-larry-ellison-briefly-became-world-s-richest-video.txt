Live on Bloomberg TVCC-TranscriptOpenClose00:00For a few hours this week. The richest person in the world wasn't
Elon Musk. It was Larry Ellison whose personal
fortune suddenly skyrocketed. Larry Ellison's net worth soared by $89
billion. That was the biggest one day gain ever
recorded on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.
The cause of this giant leap. The company Ellison co-founded.
Oracle just had a bit of a moment. Oracle shares have surged pre-market
after the company posted a major increase in bookings and gave an
aggressive outlook for its cloud infrastructure business.
Oracle made its name selling database software back in the late seventies, but
in recent years it's become a tech behemoth thanks to the key role it plays
in cloud computing. And it's that demand for cloud services
that has driven the company's recent stock surge.
Oracle's cloud computing business is really in demand by A.I.
companies. That's essentially allowed it to reframe
its narrative around AI and to ride the stock boom that's been connected with
other AI companies. On September 10th, it was revealed that
Oracle made a deal with Openai that creators of chat GPT were $300 billion.
I think a lot of investors and analysts are assuming that if it can do deals
like that, there will be more coming down the line.
Now, if you've been paying attention to Oracle, this has actually been a while
in the making the last several quarters. This has been the story of their
earnings after years of sluggish growth. Oracle's revenue is expected to take off
thanks to the race for a computing power that sent sales in its cloud
infrastructure unit soaring. The New Deal with Openai built on a
critical A.I. agreement announced in July.
This is an unprecedented cloud deal. I mean, this is likely the largest
single cloud deal ever signed. Ellison and Oracle are part of a half a
trillion dollar announcement called Stargate that Trump made several months
ago. It's a partnership between Oracle,
Openai and SoftBank in the goals to build data centers for AI across the
U.S.. And Oracle will be a key computing power
provider for that initiative. While the likes of Musk, Jeff Bezos and
Mark Zuckerberg have all vied for Donald Trump's attention, Ellison seems to have
succeeded in nurturing a lasting working relationship with the U.S.
president. I have a high respect for Larry Ellison.
He's somebody I know. He's been really a terrific guy for a
long time. While Oracle's share price has tripled
in three years since the arrival of Chatbot, the A.I.
revolution wasn't enough to keep Ellison as the world's richest person.
So this was a brief flirtation with the top spot for Larry Ellison.
He was surpassed by the end of the day, Wednesday by Elon Musk, again, who has
been in first place on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index for much of the year.
There are questions of how long this boom in A.I.
stocks can last. A lot of investors have expressed
concerns that at least some of these companies are overpriced at this point.
And there are fears that if the economy starts to slow down, that we could see a
pullback in these stocks. And of course, if that happens, the
billionaires whose wealth is tied to these companies, including Larry
Ellison, will see a concurrent fall in their fortunes.
Musk stands to potentially leap far, far ahead of all of his billionaire peers in
the coming years. It was announced recently that Tesla's
board has approved a $1 trillion pay package for Musk.
He has to meet several very ambitious milestones in order to get all of that
money. But if he does succeed in doing that, it
could make him the world's first trillionaire.
And there's no one else who would come anywhere close to that level as of right
now.For YouLive TVNOW PLAYINGHow Larry Ellison (Briefly) Became the World’s Richest Person01:49Fed's Daly Says Job Market Slowing, Not Sure How Much Is AI56:36 Bitter Pills | Summers on the Fed, Funding Fallout, Milei's Tough Policies, UK’s Growth Gamble39:21Trump Says Xi Approved TikTok Deal | Balance of Power Late Edition 9/19/202501:32:21Stocks Climb to New Highs as Corporate Bonds Show Strength | The Close 9/19/202514:54How the US Regulatory Structure Discourages Firms From Going Public09:39Fed Faces 'Unprecedented' Inflation vs. Jobs Dilemma, Larry Summers Says06:09DJ John Summit to Launch 'Experts Only' Festival in NYC07:27Hagar Chemali on Latest Between Israel, Hamas06:59Are There Any Security Concerns Around TikTok Deal08:17The Choices for Fed Chair Are "Excellent People": Siegel07:49Trump’s War on Media Expands With Jimmy Kimmel Suspension07:51Google is The Long-Term Winner in Consumer AI: Dan Niles04:25Oracle in Talks With Meta on $20 Billion AI Cloud Deal10:36Senator Warner on Government Shutdown, H-1B Visas, Gabbard01:29Trump: There ‘Very Well’ Could Be a Government ShutdownStream Schedule:U.S. BTV+U.S. BTV+U.S. BTVEurope BTVAsia BTVAustralia BTVU.S. Live EventEMEA Live EventAsia Live EventPolitics Live EventNo schedule data available.BTV Channel FinderWatch BTV in your areaHow Larry Ellison (Briefly) Became the World’s Richest PersonSeptember 12th, 2025, 5:50 PM GMT+0000Oracle CEO Larry Ellison momentarily surpassed Elon Musk to become the world’s richest person this week.
