Live on Bloomberg TVCC-TranscriptOpenClose00:00What tech giant has a connected ecosystem of products,
a devoted fan base
and is constantly innovating?
If you’re in the US
you may say Apple
but in China
it’s Xiaomi.
It’s this consistent marketing
to the younger consumers in China
that has cultivated kind of a cult following.
For many consumers in China
Xiaomi is Apple,
it’s Tesla,
it’s Google.
Now, Xiaomi has managed what Apple failed to do —
build a car.
Xiaomi’s shares have touched a record high
after strong initial orders for its new $35,000 SUV.
Within three years,
they managed to set up
this very complicated supply chain in China
and essentially churn out these incredibly popular cars.
Profits have jumped
as customers rushed
to the company’s latest offerings.
But succeeding in the world’s most crowded EV market isn’t easy.
Competition is really fierce right now.
Growth will mean turning Xiaomi into a global brand
and this is no easy task
when the world’s biggest economy is effectively off limits
because of trade barriers.
Yet, Chinese companies are already
tapping markets beyond the US.
So, is Xiaomi on easy street
or will it be a bumpy road to success?
Xiaomi is one of China's biggest smartphone and electronics companies.
Their phones are innovative, creative by design.
But in the meantime
it's much cheaper than top-line competitors
like Samsung and Apple.
The quality of the phone may not be as good as iPhone’s
but if you look at the operating system
that's something that will get buyers.
The company's image is inseparable from its founder.
Think Apple and Steve Jobs.
That's how China sees Xiaomi and its CEO, Lei Jun.
Lei Jun is a big reason for why
the company has been so successful.
Xiaomi’s first product was
for the Android operating system
but it quickly moved on.
By 2014,
it was China's most popular smartphone.
Xiaomi’s products tap directly into
the modern consumer's desire for connectivity.
They are selling lots of things.
Toothbrushes,
scooters,
cat feeders,
watches.
And even mattresses.
I mean, what kind of tech company sells mattresses?
The goal that Xiaomi is trying to achieve
is to seamlessly integrate Xiaomi's products
into almost every corner of your life.
The EV project is to fill in that void for Xiaomi
so that it can build a fuller ecosystem for its users.
But there was another reason.
In 2021,
the company's growth hit a roadblock.
The biggest reason for Xiaomi to enter into EVs was because of US sanctions,
and that actually put
Xiaomi management into a panic because
smartphones were still quite a big chunk of their revenue at that time.
The board was actually asking Lei Jun,
what are you going to do if you can't sell smartphones anymore?
So when it was first brought up,
Lei Jun was struggling a lot.
Lei Jun wrestled with the idea for good reason.
Many people say EVs are actually smartphones with wheels
but it's much more complicated than that.
If you’re making a smartphone,
I think the number of components is
probably over 1,000 or 2,000 or so components.
But if you're making a car,
that number jumps to
tens of thousands of components
and a very extensive supply chain.
Lei Jun admitted that he was not
someone who knows about EVs that well.
And then you have to bring in talents, right?
The best way to do that is to scoop from other companies.
So, Lei Jun set about wooing the best talent from across China's EV industry.
Xiaomi’s headhunters
actually reached out and,
they basically offered them a salary
that they cannot say no.
Geely is probably one of
the best examples because
their former director of
their research institute decided to
go over to Lei Jun’s investment fund.
We also know that executives from BMW,
from other Chinese automakers such as SAIC and Wuling
have also joined Xiaomi.
With talent in hand,
Xiaomi threw itself into
all parts of the EV supply chain,
investing over $1.6 billion into more than 100 companies
and eventually constructing its own factory in Beijing.
I don't think we've seen anything like that in the auto industry,
at least definitely for the China market.
In 2024,
Xiaomi launched its first car,
the SU7.
All of this has sent Xiaomi stock surging
faster than its European counterparts.
Xiaomi has always denied this,
but just looking at Xiaomi’s first EV,
the SU7 sedan,
a lot of people would say that
it resembles a Porsche Taycan.
They are trying to learn from the best,
and in the meantime,
the boundary between learning and copycatting,
I don't think it's that clear.
And Xiaomi’s been
taking notes on mistakes as well.
Avoiding issues which
slowed its competitors down.
So how did a company largely unknown outside of China
manage to do what Apple couldn't?
Apple and Xiaomi probably were
reaching for different goals.
Apple was really looking to disrupt the entire automotive industry
with something like an entirely autonomous car
that required no human assistance,
while Xiaomi took a more grounded approach.
It's not a completely new disruptive product on the market.
On top of this
Xiaomi has proved to be very efficient at scaling up.
It took 230 days
for the EV maker to pump out its first 100,000 units,
while for some of its Chinese competitors
this took far longer.
And it's a good thing too
because their cars are selling fast.
Its price tag is part of the reason why.
In China, the starting price for Xiaomi's SU7 is just over $30,000.
And its follow-up vehicle, the YU7,
is around $35,000.
This makes them competitive alternatives to Tesla's Model 3 and Model Y.
The incredible pace of Xiaomi’s EV development
also shows how unique China's market is.
Through the past decade
the Chinese government has invested heavily into
building out this charging network as well as a supply chain
that goes everything from batteries
to technology such as LiDARs.
So, all of this state support has meant that
there's a very mature and sophisticated supply chain
to help get a new brand off the ground.
In 2024,
just over 64% of all passenger EV sales were in China.
And China has around 140 EV manufacturers.
But when looking at a list of the country's best-selling cars,
Xiaomi is a small player.
It's not bad for a company that has only three years of experience making EVs.
But if you talk about BYD or Tesla,
they are on a million-level.
Xiaomi set an ambitious goal
to become one of the world's top five car makers
within the next 15 to 20 years.
To make that happen,
Xiaomi needs to find customers outside of China.
But there are a lot of hurdles in the way.
Similar to other Chinese automakers,
Xiaomi is going to face a lot of geopolitical uncertainties
as it expands globally.
You've got all of these trade barriers
that regions such as the EU, the US, Canada, Turkey,
they have all introduced tariffs to
try to stave off this wave of Chinese EV expansion.
The US has a 100% tariff on Chinese EVs,
effectively locking Xiaomi out.
It's very, very difficult for a Chinese brand to penetrate that market.
The industry’s dominant player right now is BYD
and you've also got the industry pioneer, Tesla,
that is actually suffering a slump in sales.
So, it's very hard to say
how things will turn out within the next decade.For YouLive TVNOW PLAYINGXiaomi Beat Apple.
