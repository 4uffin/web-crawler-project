Bloomberg Surveillance hosted by Tom Keene & Paul Sweeney
September 19th, 2025
Featuring:
1) Yelena Shulyatyeva, Senior Economist at the Conference Board, joins for a discussion on the Fed's rate cut and the US economic outlook. US stocks are set for a quieter finish to a busy week after the Federal Reserve’s first step in a likely series of rapid interest rate cuts propelled markets to fresh records.
2) Sarah Hunt, Chief Market Strategist at Alpine Saxon Woods, on what comes next for markets after the Fed's long-anticipated rate cut. Looser policy is giving equity bulls a tailwind just as lofty valuations run up against bearish seasonal trends, with investors seeing plenty to keep equities climbing after a stellar rally.
3) Hessam Nadji, CEO at Marcus & Millichap, joins to discuss how lowered interest rates could reshape real estate, Commercial Real Estate, and whether the concerns over CRE continue to be overblown.
4) Lisa Mateo joins with the latest headlines in newspapers across the US, including a NYT story on a new study showing men seek weight loss treatment far less than women and WSJ's report on more homeowners spending big on outdoor cat patios, dubbed "Catios."Sep 19, 2025SubscribeWhere to Listen:SpotifyApple PodcastsShare This Episode:Terms of ServiceDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationTrademarksPrivacy PolicyCareersMade in NYCAdvertiseAd ChoicesHelp©2025 Bloomberg L.P.
