Bloomberg Surveillance hosted by Tom Keene & Paul Sweeney
September 16th, 2025
Featuring:
1) Alicia Levine, Head of Investment Strategy and Equity Advisory Solutions at BNY, on her S&P target and the sustainability of the equity rally. Stock bulls are riding high ahead of the Fed’s widely expected 25-basis-point cut on Wednesday, the first move in a policy easing round projected to run into 2026. Rate-sensitive tech shares have led the charge in the post-Liberation Day rebound, fueled by enthusiasm over the vast earnings potential tied to artificial intelligence.
2) Dana Telsey, CEO and Chief Research Officer at Telsey Advisory Group, brings us into retail sales and talks about consumer health and the luxury sector. With the jobs market softening and prices rising, questions remain over how long consumers will keep spending freely.
3) Liza Crawford, Co-Head of Globalized Securitized at TCW, brings us into the market open and talks asset backed finance and digital infrastructure.
4) Lisa Mateo joins with the latest headlines in newspapers across the US, including an FT story on Prime Vision Football and the Washington Post's coverage of DC's first phone free bar.Sep 16, 2025SubscribeWhere to Listen:SpotifyApple PodcastsShare This Episode:Terms of ServiceDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationTrademarksPrivacy PolicyCareersMade in NYCAdvertiseAd ChoicesHelp©2025 Bloomberg L.P.
