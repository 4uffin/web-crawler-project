The news broke Friday that despite a seemingly waning interest in making cars and his alienation of many of Tesla’s customers, Elon Musk was offered a record-busting payday by the carmaker’s board. The catch? The South Africa native and richest person in the world (even before the $1 trillion) has to help the embattled automaker meet certain goals when it comes to company value and product development.
In this episode of Elon, Inc., host David Papadopoulos gathers Bloomberg Businessweek’s Max Chafkin and Bloomberg News Elon Musk reporter Dana Hull to discuss the new pay package, its stipulations (such as growing Tesla’s market value to $8.5 trillion and delivering 1 million robots in ten years) and how likely it is that investors will approve the payout.
Speaking of the Nov. 6 shareholder meeting, the crew is also joined by Bloomberg tech reporter Kurt Wagner to discus another investor matter: whether Tesla should invest in Musk’s artificial intelligence startup xAI (the conflict of interest practically writes itself). Also of note is the idea that a company like Tesla that’s increasingly turning to AI would invest in another AI company. Wagner tries his hardest to explain the situation and adds a substantial caveat: according to the proxy, the shareholder vote won’t be binding. Sep 09, 2025Share This Episode:Terms of ServiceDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationTrademarksPrivacy PolicyCareersMade in NYCAdvertiseAd ChoicesHelp©2025 Bloomberg L.P.
