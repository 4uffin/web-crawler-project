Then, they speak with Catie Griggs about how she thinks about the business of baseball as President of Business Operations of the Baltimore Orioles. Griggs – who, like Alex, did a stint with the Seattle Mariners – tells the hosts what she thinks her team and Commissioner Rob Manfred need to do to continue to grow the MLB as a league, why she sees the city’s urban center and the team’s legendary history as strategic assets, and what she’s learned by working with Orioles owners David Rubenstein and Michael Arougheti.Sep 18, 2025Share This Episode:Terms of ServiceDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationTrademarksPrivacy PolicyCareersMade in NYCAdvertiseAd ChoicesHelp©2025 Bloomberg L.P.
