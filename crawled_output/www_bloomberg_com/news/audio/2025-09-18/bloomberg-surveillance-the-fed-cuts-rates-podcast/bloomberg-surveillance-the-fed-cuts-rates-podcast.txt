Bloomberg Surveillance hosted by Tom Keene & Paul Sweeney
September 18th, 2025
Featuring:
1) Frances Donald, Chief Economist at RBC, joins for an extended discussion on the US labor market, inflation, and the Fed balancing its dual mandate. Fed Chair Jay Powell rallied a deeply divided committee of policymakers behind an interest rate-cut, the first cut of the year, after a significant slowdown in job growth.
2) Ian Lyngen, Head of US Rates Strategy at BMO Capital Markets, joins to talk about the 10-year yield's path below 4% and outlook for Treasury gains. Jay Powell conceded the Fed's job would get more difficult, as policymakers face difficult trade-offs in considering whether to keep cutting rates, with some officials concerned about inflation and others about the labor market.
3) Robert Kaplan, Vice Chairman at Goldman Sachs, talks about the Fed's decision to cut interest rates and whether the US economy is in, or could enter, a recession.
4) Lisa Mateo joins with the latest headlines in newspapers across the US, including a WSJ story on AI agents and a Bloomberg report on Gen Z and FICO scores.Sep 18, 2025SubscribeWhere to Listen:SpotifyApple PodcastsShare This Episode:Terms of ServiceDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationTrademarksPrivacy PolicyCareersMade in NYCAdvertiseAd ChoicesHelp©2025 Bloomberg L.P.
