Advocates for the blind are calling out tech companies by name and pushing for change.FacebookXLinkedInEmailLinkGiftFacebookXLinkedInEmailLinkGiftBy Miquéla V ThorntonSeptember 12, 2025 at 1:30 PM UTCCorrected September 12, 2025 at 4:59 PM UTCBookmarkSaveWhen Emeline Lakrout quit her job at Unilever Plc in March after five years with the company, it wasn’t for a better offer or a career pivot. She left, she said, because too much of the software she needed in her marketing role was inaccessible to her as a blind user and invisible to her screen reader.If coworkers asked her to use Trello, a project management tool made by Atlassian Corp., she would politely request alternatives. Software from Anaplan Inc., a company owned by the private equity firm Thoma Bravo, forced her to squint centimeters from a giant monitor, straining her remaining vision. And working on slide decks was especially vexing when her screen reader viewed slide content as images instead of text, often out of order, making presentations hard to create and decipher.Contact us:Provide news feedback or report an errorConfidential tip?Send a tip to our reportersSite feedback:Take our SurveyNew WindowBefore it’s here, it’s on the Bloomberg TerminalBloomberg Terminal LEARN MOREHomeBTV+Market DataOpinionAudioOriginalsMagazineEventsNewsMarketsEconomicsTechnologyPoliticsGreenCryptoAIWork & LifeWealthPursuitsBusinessweekCityLabSportsEqualityManagement & WorkMarket DataStocksCommoditiesRates & BondsCurrenciesFuturesSectorsEconomic CalendarExploreNewslettersExplainersPointed News QuizThe Big TakeGraphicsSubmit a TipAbout UsTerms of ServiceDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationTrademarksPrivacy PolicyCareersMade in NYCAdvertiseAd ChoicesHelp©2025 Bloomberg L.P.
