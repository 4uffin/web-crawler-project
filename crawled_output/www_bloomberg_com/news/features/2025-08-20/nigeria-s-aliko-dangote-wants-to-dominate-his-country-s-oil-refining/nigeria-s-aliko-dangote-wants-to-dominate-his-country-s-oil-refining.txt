The desolate landscape underscores the difficulty of building anything this ambitious 50 miles from the center of Lagos, the country’s central metropolis. At night, from a distance, only a single flare burning off gas from the plant offers any hint of a vast, and consequential, industrial complex.The refinery operates as a kind of city-state. It has its own jetty and breakwater to ensure the safe delivery of high-tech equipment, as well as a dedicated quarry, dam, water treatment center and power plant. Almost half the size of Manhattan, it sits on 100 million tons of sand—dredged during ­construction—17 times the weight of the Great Pyramid of Giza.Contact us:Provide news feedback or report an errorConfidential tip?Send a tip to our reportersSite feedback:Take our SurveyNew WindowBefore it’s here, it’s on the Bloomberg TerminalBloomberg Terminal LEARN MOREHomeBTV+Market DataOpinionAudioOriginalsMagazineEventsNewsMarketsEconomicsTechnologyPoliticsGreenCryptoAIWork & LifeWealthPursuitsBusinessweekCityLabSportsEqualityManagement & WorkMarket DataStocksCommoditiesRates & BondsCurrenciesFuturesSectorsEconomic CalendarExploreNewslettersExplainersPointed News QuizThe Big TakeGraphicsSubmit a TipAbout UsTerms of ServiceDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationTrademarksPrivacy PolicyCareersMade in NYCAdvertiseAd ChoicesHelp©2025 Bloomberg L.P.
