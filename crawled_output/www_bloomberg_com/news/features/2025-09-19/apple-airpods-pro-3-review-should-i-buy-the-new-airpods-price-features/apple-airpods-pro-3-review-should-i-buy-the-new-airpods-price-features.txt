But in a year that’s seen the consumer electronics giant introduce its most significant iPhone overhaul in a while, it’s taking similarly ambitious swings with the new AirPods Pro 3 — though you wouldn’t know it from the outside. First impressions can be deceiving like that.The wireless earbuds, which went on sale Friday, maintain the recognizable style of their predecessors, and they still only come in white.
