An exclusive interview.FacebookXLinkedInEmailLinkGiftFacebookXLinkedInEmailLinkGiftBy Daniel Flatley and Erik SchatzkerAugust 11, 2025 at 9:00 PM UTCUpdated on August 11, 2025 at 11:48 PM UTCBookmarkSaveThis article is part of the September 1, 2025 issue of businessweek.Chevron RightOn April 6, the Sunday after Donald Trump unveiled his “Liberation Day” tariffs, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent joined the president on a flight back to Washington from Mar-a-Lago. Bessent wanted to talk about damage control. By then the image of Trump in the Rose Garden waving placards displaying import duties as high as 49% had spooked investors around the world, triggering the biggest two-day selloff in stocks since the pandemic. “We are in the process of destroying confidence in our country as a trading partner, as a place to do business, and as a market to invest capital,” billionaire investor Bill Ackman wrote in a post on X, warning of a coming “economic nuclear winter.” JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon chimed in, saying the tariffs were likely to reignite inflation and possibly induce a recession. Larry Summers, a former Treasury secretary, predicted the US would suffer job losses in the millions.
