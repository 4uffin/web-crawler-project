That could mean an elected official who’s energetically committed to presenting themselves that way—either by way of a populist political program (New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez), or a willingness to show up on podcasts with right-wing provocateurs (California Governor Gavin Newsom), or a folksy Upper Midwestern affect (Minnesota Governor Tim Walz). But after nominating an octogenarian amid concerns about his competence, then switching candidates because of those concerns, and then losing anyway to a convicted felon who’s already been impeached twice, Democrats may well conclude that the most electable candidate isn’t a politician at all.
