We examined the emails themselves as well as enclosures to the emails. Four independent experts reviewed our methods and said they aligned with best practices. In summary, these examinations strongly authenticated a portion of the emails; corroborated sources of important enclosures; and found no meaningful evidence of fakery. We did find evidence that some emails had been deleted.Contact us:Provide news feedback or report an errorConfidential tip?Send a tip to our reportersSite feedback:Take our SurveyNew WindowBefore it’s here, it’s on the Bloomberg TerminalBloomberg Terminal LEARN MOREHomeBTV+Market DataOpinionAudioOriginalsMagazineEventsNewsMarketsEconomicsTechnologyPoliticsGreenCryptoAIWork & LifeWealthPursuitsBusinessweekCityLabSportsEqualityManagement & WorkMarket DataStocksCommoditiesRates & BondsCurrenciesFuturesSectorsEconomic CalendarExploreNewslettersExplainersPointed News QuizThe Big TakeGraphicsSubmit a TipAbout UsTerms of ServiceDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationTrademarksPrivacy PolicyCareersMade in NYCAdvertiseAd ChoicesHelp©2025 Bloomberg L.P.
