The emails, which have not been previously reported, reveal new details about the disgraced financier and sex offender and his yearslong partnership with socialite Ghislaine Maxwell.The emails span a 20-year timeframe but the message traffic is most active between 2005 and 2008. The communications reveal that Maxwell and Epstein were closer, in many respects, than either publicly admitted. They exchanged at least 650 emails in all and about 203 messages during the first six months of 2008, undercutting Maxwell’s public assertions that her connection to Epstein had diminished by the time he went to jail in June 2008. (Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence after a jury found that she recruited and groomed women and girls for Epstein to sexually abuse.)
