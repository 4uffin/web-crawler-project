How long will it take—and how much will it cost?Niccol at a Starbucks in Seattle.Photographer: Grant Hindsley for Bloomberg BusinessweekFacebookXLinkedInEmailLinkGiftFacebookXLinkedInEmailLinkGiftBy Daniela SirtoriJuly 15, 2025 at 9:00 PM UTCBookmarkSaveThis article is part of the August 1, 2025 issue of businessweek.Chevron RightBrian Niccol is standing in the corner of a newly renovated Starbucks in Seattle on an afternoon in mid-April. Baristas are making iced cherry chai lattes and mocha Frappuccinos with whipped cream, and warming egg bites and croissants. Customers sit in plush mustard-colored chairs and on cushioned benches in an olive tone, surrounded by wood-paneled walls. “I like it,” says Niccol, who took over as chief executive officer in September. “I like the furniture. I like the lighting. I like the music.” Mostly he likes the vibe. People camping out, doing homework, chatting with friends. There’s a guy preparing a tax return. “Every seat is full,” Niccol says. “That’s what we want. What we should be able to do is have spaces for people that, if you want to socialize, you can socialize. If you want a moment for yourself, you have a moment for yourself.” He asks me what I think is the best seat in the house, and I tell him I’d tried a few as I alternated between grabbing a bite and working on my laptop. “I want a great seat for whatever occasion you’re having. If you want to eat, that’s probably the best seat,” he says, pointing to the cushioned bench.Contact us:Provide news feedback or report an errorConfidential tip?Send a tip to our reportersSite feedback:Take our SurveyNew WindowBefore it’s here, it’s on the Bloomberg TerminalBloomberg Terminal LEARN MOREHomeBTV+Market DataOpinionAudioOriginalsMagazineEventsNewsMarketsEconomicsTechnologyPoliticsGreenCryptoAIWork & LifeWealthPursuitsBusinessweekCityLabSportsEqualityManagement & WorkMarket DataStocksCommoditiesRates & BondsCurrenciesFuturesSectorsEconomic CalendarExploreNewslettersExplainersPointed News QuizThe Big TakeGraphicsSubmit a TipAbout UsTerms of ServiceDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationTrademarksPrivacy PolicyCareersMade in NYCAdvertiseAd ChoicesHelp©2025 Bloomberg L.P.
