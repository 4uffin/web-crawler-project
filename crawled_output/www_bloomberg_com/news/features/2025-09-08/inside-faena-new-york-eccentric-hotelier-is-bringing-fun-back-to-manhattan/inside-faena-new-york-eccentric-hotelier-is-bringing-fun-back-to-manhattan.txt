Inside, muralist Diego Gravinese is at work putting the finishing touches on a 105-foot-wide, 28-foot-tall installation that includes a mythical Colossal Woman pulling an unknown treasure out of an ocean vortex and a constellation of symbols hovering over clusters of quartz. A spiral staircase enrobed in gold leaf glows on one side. “It’s a cathedral,” Faena declares, replacing the apparent L-word with an embellished term he’s used at all his hotels. The Colossal Woman, he says, is creating the world.It would be easy to assume that a man whose last name is presented in towering gold letters over the entrance of a Bjarke Ingels Group-designed structure would build hospitality cathedrals to worship his perceived genius. But Faena is soft-spoken and self-effacing, even if his eccentric design ethos is very much the opposite. As such, his goal for the cathedral—and indeed many of his hotels’ nooks and crannies—is to give a hallowed space to all strata of New York City’s broader community.Contact us:Provide news feedback or report an errorConfidential tip?Send a tip to our reportersSite feedback:Take our SurveyNew WindowBefore it’s here, it’s on the Bloomberg TerminalBloomberg Terminal LEARN MOREHomeBTV+Market DataOpinionAudioOriginalsMagazineEventsNewsMarketsEconomicsTechnologyPoliticsGreenCryptoAIWork & LifeWealthPursuitsBusinessweekCityLabSportsEqualityManagement & WorkMarket DataStocksCommoditiesRates & BondsCurrenciesFuturesSectorsEconomic CalendarExploreNewslettersExplainersPointed News QuizThe Big TakeGraphicsSubmit a TipAbout UsTerms of ServiceDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationTrademarksPrivacy PolicyCareersMade in NYCAdvertiseAd ChoicesHelp©2025 Bloomberg L.P.
