InnovationBloomberg Beta
Bloomberg Beta is an early-stage venture firm, backed by Bloomberg L.P., focused on understanding the profound changes in the way business works.
The fund invests for financial return and chooses its investments independently, without preference for companies who have or want a relationship with Bloomberg. It is focused broadly on the future of work, and is inspired by Bloomberg as a template for startups — founded on a powerful idea, bringing transparency to markets, achieving global scale, with a strong and open culture that embraces technology, led by its founders for decades.
Bloomberg Beta’s full web presence can be found on GitHub.
Bloomberg Beta founders and their startups
We are actively backing new companies. That said, many of our companies prefer to wait to announce their fundraise, so the lists below, particularly for recent investments, are missing many unannounced investments.
Below are our (publicly announced) investments, ordered by fund. While we know that many readers of this page want to know our best-performing companies, it's important to us to be transparent about all our investments -- all founders we've backed are our customers. Our most important metric is founder NPS; every founder gets the same vote in deciding our reputation. If you're interested to know which companies the broader community finds most interesting, see our Wikipedia page.
Curious why a founder would want to work with us, hear directly from them here or keep reading for a few excerpts:
Kieran Snyder, Textio: “Within a few minutes of meeting us -- at a time when we didn't yet have a product -- Roy made observations about our eventual go-to-market that were so insightful that we knew we had to work with him.”
Scott Heiferman, Meetup: "Karin's been investing in the New York tech community since before it was cool, before it was big. Karin is a reason why New York is on the map in today's tech economy, she's in it for the long haul. She's always there for entrepreneurs."
Ryan Petersen, Flexport: "I use [Roy's] advice really effectively, and it is part of why we're a shipping company that people have actually heard of is that we, I listened to Roy, and I did as he said, and I really, really appreciate it. It's not too many investors that really did something that lastingly contributed to the company's success.
Anthony Goldbloom, Kaggle: "The thing I loved most about working with Bloomberg Beta is that the advice I found and received wasn't just rehashed Silicon-Valley-conventional wisdom, but rather guidance that was creative and very much tailored to the specifics of my situation.”
Amjad Masad, Replit: "Roy took my meetings when others wouldn't open my emails. Without Bloomberg Beta's long-term view we wouldn't be where we are today."
David Rogier, MasterClass: "Bloomberg Beta has been there for us from the beginning. I still text and talk with James and Roy all the time. Not only are they really smart, they’re also good people."
Christine Tao, Sounding Board: "Bloomberg Beta...has their own perspectives and they're willing to invest and put their money behind founders without having to look at who else is in the round, or just following trends."
Lukas Biewald, Weights & Biases: "James was my first choice of investors I wanted to work with in my second company because he's so good at pushing me to think clearly and so relentlessly positive and thoughtful.”
