Tech at BloombergPushing the boundaries on innovation
We look decades ahead to create what our clients will someday need.
That’s been Bloomberg’s mission from day one, when we designed and built the Bloomberg Terminal – pioneering technology that transformed an industry where information was transmitted slowly and inefficiently. Four decades later, innovation continues to drive and infuse everything we do. We’re constantly imagining and investing in the future – always going where others aren’t, can’t, or won’t.
Engineering value for our customers
At Bloomberg, we’re continually optimizing our solutions.
This means applying the principle of the four Vs – volume, velocity, variety and veracity – to financial data and news. This lets us deliver critical, actionable insights that help our clients make more efficient and informed decisions.
We’re a leader in the industry when it comes to applying artificial intelligence, machine learning and natural language processing to financial models and up-to-the-second market data. There’s an ever-expanding ocean of data available at all times – and we give the tools and automated workflows to the world’s decision makers so they can quickly act on crucial information.

Keeping Humans in the Loop

Bloomberg runs the world’s most trusted information network for financial professionals, connecting people in ways and at speeds no one else can. Our 9,000+ engineers, developers, data scientists and technologists are the ones who make it happen, creating and advancing solutions and systems that solve complex, real-world problems for customers across the global capital markets.
