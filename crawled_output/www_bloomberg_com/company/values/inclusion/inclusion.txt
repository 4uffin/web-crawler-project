Inclusion at BloombergActivating every employee’s potential
We know that breakthrough thinking and big ideas develop when employees look at challenges from their unique perspectives. By valuing every employee, we cultivate collaboration for a better understanding of the customers and communities we serve ​so that we unlock the full potential of innovation.
It starts with how we hire
Inclusive teams make smarter decisions, but teams don’t make themselves. We find the best and brightest whoever and wherever they are.
We’ve built a culture of inclusion
We support nine employee-run Communities, open to all, whose members serve as role models and spread a message of inclusion throughout our global workplace.
