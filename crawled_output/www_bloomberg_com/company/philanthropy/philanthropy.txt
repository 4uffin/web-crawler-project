Corporate PhilanthropyGlobal reach. Local impact.
Philanthropy and service are an integral part of our culture – and have been since Mike Bloomberg founded the company.
We’re committed to giving back to the cities in which we live and work, using the time and talents of our employees, and resources of our business to create lasting impact. With our unique insight into data and news, and continual focus on innovation, we look to address unmet needs in our communities, deepen engagement with our colleagues, clients and partners, and improve lives around the world. Every Bloomberg employee in every one of our offices makes that commitment possible.
Expanding access to data and technology
Our business was founded on innovation: giving small investors access to the same real-time financial information as large institutions – increasing transparency to create a more level playing field across global markets. We believe more inclusive access to data and technology can deliver similarly powerful results for society. That’s why we’re helping communities use data science to improve civic outcomes, assisting cultural institutions to engage a wider audience through technology, and ensuring students learn the coding, technical and soft skills they need to unlock opportunity and drive progress in an increasingly digital world.

Promoting an inclusive global economy
Economic inequality is one of the greatest challenges facing the global economy and presents a significant threat to its stability – particularly during times of crisis. We’re committed to making the world of finance more accessible. We’re providing the resources that small businesses and nonprofits need to innovate and support the growth of local communities. And we’re working with our network of nonprofit partners to ensure more individuals have the relevant skills and experience for employment and entrepreneurship; supporting global efforts to make the world’s economy fairer and more inclusive for all.
Broadening perspectives in media and the arts
Through our Global Business and Financial Journalism Education Initiative and the Bloomberg Media Initiative Africa we’re helping source, train and upskill journalists from all backgrounds. We’re also supporting the arts to advance creativity, broaden perspectives and strengthen local communities. Our commitment to public art is visible across our global offices, in London Mithraeum Bloomberg SPACE, and in dynamic installations around the world.
Addressing the world’s most pressing needs
At Bloomberg, giving back starts from the ground up. Our global employee giving and volunteer program, the Best of Bloomberg, harnesses the collective effort and generosity of our employees to strengthen their communities – and support the causes they’re most passionate about. Together we drive change on critical social issues by helping our most vulnerable and marginalized neighbors, and taking urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.
