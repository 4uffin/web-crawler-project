A dollar of earnings today is worth more than a dollar of earnings in 10 years, because you use some non-zero discount rate in computing the present value. But a dollar of earnings today is worth less than $10 billion of earnings in 10 years, because the discount rate isn’t 900% either. Investors should pay more for the stock of a company that makes no money now but will make a ton of money later than they would pay for the stock of a company that makes a little money now and will continue to make a little money later. And they do. Promising tech companies regularly trade at high valuations long before they make any money. OpenAI’s stock is worth $500 billion and it’s a money furnace.An important but underappreciated theoretical fact is that this is true for all investors, no matter how long they plan to hold the stock. If you buy a share of stock today and sell it tomorrow, you are not buying one day of its cash flows. If the company announces earnings this afternoon, and the announcement is like “good news we made a ton of money today, bad news we won’t make any money in the future,” you did not do a good trade. The stock will go down due to the bad news about future cash flows, and tomorrow you will sell it for less than you paid.
