Davies, ColumnistMorgan Stanley Shows Why Traders Are Winning AgainDan Simkowitz, co-president of the US bank, coined a term that helps illuminate the industry’s recovery — Derivative-izationSeptember 15, 2025 at 3:00 AM UTCBy Paul J.

Simkowitz, who runs trading and investment banking at Morgan Stanley, did both. He was talking about the bank’s equities business, but his idea helps explain why the entire industry’s markets revenue has recovered from the long malaise it had fallen into in the years before 2020. It also shows how non-banks like Jane Street LLC and Citadel Securities have bloomed without eating into Wall Street’s income.HomeBTV+Market DataOpinionAudioOriginalsMagazineEventsNewsMarketsEconomicsTechnologyPoliticsGreenCryptoAIWork & LifeWealthPursuitsBusinessweekCityLabSportsEqualityManagement & WorkMarket DataStocksCommoditiesRates & BondsCurrenciesFuturesSectorsEconomic CalendarExploreNewslettersExplainersPointed News QuizThe Big TakeGraphicsSubmit a TipAbout UsTerms of ServiceDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationTrademarksPrivacy PolicyCareersMade in NYCAdvertiseAd ChoicesHelp©2025 Bloomberg L.P.
