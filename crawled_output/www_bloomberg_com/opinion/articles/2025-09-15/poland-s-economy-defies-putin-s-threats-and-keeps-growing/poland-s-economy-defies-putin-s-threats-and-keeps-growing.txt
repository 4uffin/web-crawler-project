The boundary with Russian puppet-state Belarus stretches for an additional 250 miles or so. The implication being that if Ukraine falls, Poland might be next.And yet, something remarkable has happened in this nation of 38 million, whose descendants go back more than 1,000 years, predating Moscow like much-older Kyiv. Poland has become no less than a juggernaut among 26 nations in the European Union, with the fastest-growing economy, the strongest emerging market currency and the most appreciated bonds sold by 50 countries since Russia invaded Ukraine three years ago.HomeBTV+Market DataOpinionAudioOriginalsMagazineEventsNewsMarketsEconomicsTechnologyPoliticsGreenCryptoAIWork & LifeWealthPursuitsBusinessweekCityLabSportsEqualityManagement & WorkMarket DataStocksCommoditiesRates & BondsCurrenciesFuturesSectorsEconomic CalendarExploreNewslettersExplainersPointed News QuizThe Big TakeGraphicsSubmit a TipAbout UsTerms of ServiceDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationTrademarksPrivacy PolicyCareersMade in NYCAdvertiseAd ChoicesHelp©2025 Bloomberg L.P.
