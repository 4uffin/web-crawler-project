The latest one — Dec. 16 — was announced by the White House on Tuesday. This time, at least, it looks as though the can-kicking is edging toward an agreement. Given what we know so far, it’s a bum deal for TikTok’s users in the US that falls short of addressing the national security claims that got us here in the first place. The black box for the all-important algorithm remains sealed.
