It was strictly business, nothing personal. In 2008, I revealed in the Sunday Times that the twice-disgraced Labour cabinet minister had been a holiday guest on board the Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska’s yacht off the Greek island of Corfu. Deripaska, the victor in Russia’s corpse-strewn "aluminum wars" in the 1990s, had benefited from a cut in European Union aluminum tariffs introduced by Mandelson when he had been trade commissioner in Brussels.HomeBTV+Market DataOpinionAudioOriginalsMagazineEventsNewsMarketsEconomicsTechnologyPoliticsGreenCryptoAIWork & LifeWealthPursuitsBusinessweekCityLabSportsEqualityManagement & WorkMarket DataStocksCommoditiesRates & BondsCurrenciesFuturesSectorsEconomic CalendarExploreNewslettersExplainersPointed News QuizThe Big TakeGraphicsSubmit a TipAbout UsTerms of ServiceDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationTrademarksPrivacy PolicyCareersMade in NYCAdvertiseAd ChoicesHelp©2025 Bloomberg L.P.
