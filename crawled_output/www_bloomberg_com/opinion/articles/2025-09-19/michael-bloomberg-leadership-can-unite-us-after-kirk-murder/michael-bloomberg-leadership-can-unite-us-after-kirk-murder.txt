BloombergIn Dark Times, Americans Need Leadership That UnitesOur response to Charlie Kirk’s assassination must be better.September 19, 2025 at 9:00 AM UTCBy Michael R. BloombergMichael R.

Instead of bringing out the best in America, as tragedies once did, it is bringing out the worst — in both parties.It should go without saying that political violence — and gun violence — is always wrong.
