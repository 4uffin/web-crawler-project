Congressional Democrats, led by a united Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries, have decided to go big this time. The last time Congress was faced with the prospect of a government shutdown, in March, the Senate minority leader rolled over, incurring the wrath of his party.
This time, he has found his spine, and more importantly, a salient economic issue to fight over: the Affordable Care Act tax credits that are set to expire at the end of the year. In staking out ground over health care, Schumer and congressional Democrats are drawing an easy-to-understand contrast with the GOP. Republicans, saddled by bad polling over their “big beautiful bill,” would be wise to ignore President Donald Trump’s unworkable guidance to go it alone, and get to the negotiating table. That could result in a deal that represents a win for their party, and more importantly, for Americans.HomeBTV+Market DataOpinionAudioOriginalsMagazineEventsNewsMarketsEconomicsTechnologyPoliticsGreenCryptoAIWork & LifeWealthPursuitsBusinessweekCityLabSportsEqualityManagement & WorkMarket DataStocksCommoditiesRates & BondsCurrenciesFuturesSectorsEconomic CalendarExploreNewslettersExplainersPointed News QuizThe Big TakeGraphicsSubmit a TipAbout UsTerms of ServiceDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationTrademarksPrivacy PolicyCareersMade in NYCAdvertiseAd ChoicesHelp©2025 Bloomberg L.P.
