Importance of fungal awareness
Frequently misdiagnosed
Fungal diseases are increasing worldwide. Yet, they are often misdiagnosed, which can lead to severe, potentially chronic illness, and sometimes cost lives. Additionally, misdiagnosed patients often receive antibiotics, drugs designed to fight bacteria, instead of the antifungals needed treat fungal infections. Any misuse of antibiotics or antifungals may contribute to drug resistance.
Global health concerns
Emerging species (types) of ringworm and a cat-associated species of sporotrichosis are more severe, can be harder to treat, and being reported in more countries. Meanwhile three longstanding fungal skin infections are classified as Neglected Tropical Diseases. Global efforts are needed to help reduce the impact and control the spread of these conditions.
Future impact
Shifts in the environment may increase the impact of fungal diseases. Studies show that global temperature increases may allow environmental infectious fungi to grow in new areas that were previously too cold. Changes in the climate may also cause fungi to evolve, threatening the rise of new fungal infections. Some researchers believe climate change caused the emergence of the deadly fungus C. auris.
Additionally, antimicrobial resistance is increasing. With only three antifungals available and no vaccines for fungal diseases, awareness, prevention, and early diagnoses and treatment are critical.
Awareness makes a difference
With increased knowledge and understanding, everyone can help address these issues.
Fungal disease awareness among the public and healthcare providers can:
Encourage patients and providers to discuss and consider fungal diseases and testing.
Drive a unified global One Health action to help stop the threat of fungal diseases.
Inspire more research in prevention, diagnostics, and treatment.
Encourage others to learn more during FDAW and all year.
Think fungus, save lives
With increased awareness, more people with fungal infections will get the right diagnosis and treatment sooner.
