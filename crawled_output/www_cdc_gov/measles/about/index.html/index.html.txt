Some people think of measles as just a little rash and fever that clear up in a few days. But measles can cause serious health complications, especially in children younger than 5 years old.
Measles is highly contagious. If one person has it, up to 9 out of 10 people nearby will become infected if they are not protected.
The best protection against measles is measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. MMR vaccine provides long-lasting protection against all strains of measles.

These travelers are mostly Americans and sometimes international visitors.
Some people are a higher risk of experiencing severe complications from measles.
