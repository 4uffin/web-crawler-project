Preventing Type 2 Diabetes
Key points
Prediabetes is a serious health condition, and 1 in 3 US adults has it.
With early action, you can reverse prediabetes to prevent or delay type 2 diabetes.
Find out if you have a high risk for prediabetes by taking the 1-minute risk test.
What is prediabetes?
Before developing type 2 diabetes, most people have prediabetes. This is when their blood sugar is higher than normal but not high enough yet for a type 2 diabetes diagnosis. In the United States, about 98 million adults have prediabetes; that's 1 in 3 people.
There are usually no signs when you have prediabetes, which is why 81% of people don't know they have it. You can have prediabetes for years and not know.
Ready to find out where you stand? Take the 1-minute prediabetes risk test. If your score shows you have a high risk of prediabetes, visit your doctor for a simple blood test to confirm your result.
You can reverse prediabetes‎
You can reverse prediabetes to prevent or delay type 2 diabetes with proven, achievable lifestyle changes—such as losing a small amount of weight, making healthy eating choices, and getting more physically active.
