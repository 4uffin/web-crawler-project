Preventing Dengue
Key points
All four dengue viruses are spread to people primarily through the bite of an infected Aedes species mosquito.
A dengue vaccine is recommended for U.S. territories and freely associated states.
Protect yourself from dengue by avoiding mosquito bites.
Prevent mosquito bites
Dengue is spread to people through the bite of an infected mosquito. Mosquitoes bite during the day and night. There is no widely available dengue vaccine to prevent dengue infection. The best way to prevent dengue is to protect yourself from mosquito bites.
Use insect repellent.
Wear loose-fitting, long-sleeved shirts and pants.
Take steps to control mosquitoes in and around your home.

Plan for Travel
Before your Trip
Review country-specific travel recommendations, health notices, and warnings.
Visit a travel clinic or your healthcare provider for pre-travel medical care.
Pack an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered insect repellent.
Pack acetaminophen (also known as paracetamol outside of the United States) in your first aid kit. These medications can be used to manage fever and body pain in case you get dengue.
During your stay
Follow steps to prevent mosquito bites to protect yourself and your family.
Stay in places with air conditioning and with window/door screens.
Use a bed net if air conditioned or screened rooms are not available or if sleeping outdoors.
See a healthcare provider if you develop a fever or have symptoms of dengue.
After your trip
Even if you do not feel sick, travelers returning from an area with risk of dengue should take steps to prevent mosquito bites for 3 weeks so they do not spread dengue to mosquitoes that could spread the virus to other people.
Symptoms of dengue usually begin within 2 weeks after being bitten by an infected mosquito.
See a healthcare provider if you develop a fever or have symptoms of dengue. Tell him or her about your travel.
Dengue Vaccine
A dengue vaccine is approved for use in children aged 9–16 years with laboratory-confirmed previous dengue virus infection and living in areas where dengue is endemic (occurs frequently or continuously).
Endemic areas include some U.S. territories and freely associated states.
The vaccine is not approved for use in U.S. travelers who are visiting but not living in an area where dengue is common.
