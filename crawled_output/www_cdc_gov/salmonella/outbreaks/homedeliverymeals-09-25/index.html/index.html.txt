Bloody diarrhea
So much vomiting that you cannot keep liquids down
Signs of dehydration, such as not peeing much, dry mouth and throat, and feeling dizzy when standing up

Symptoms usually start 6 hours to 6 days after swallowing the bacteria.
Most people recover without treatment after 4 to 7 days.
Some people—especially children younger than 5, adults 65 and older, and people with weakened immune systems—may experience more severe illnesses that require medical treatment or hospitalization.
