What is CAPTCHA
CAPTCHA stands for “Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart” used to prevent automated software from completing a form or accessing a system.
CAPTCHA Accessibility
Many sites use the traditional CAPTCHA with distorted text or numbers that must be inputted by a website user. This method presents accessibility challenges making it difficult for persons using screen readers. As a result, CDC has chosen to use the Google reCaptcha to allow the user options to look at a new CAPTCHA challenge and or listen to the current challenge. The interface also allows the user to find out about the CAPTCHA.
