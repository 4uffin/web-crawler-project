Ear infections
Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (a kidney disease)
Rheumatic fever (a disease affecting the heart, joints, brain, skin)

Anyone can get strep throat, but some factors increase the risk of getting it.
Age
Strep throat is more common in children than adults.
Most common: Children 5 through 15 years old
