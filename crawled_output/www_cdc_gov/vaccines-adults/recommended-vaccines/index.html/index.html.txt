Find a travel clinic: Many state and local health departments provide travel vaccinations. Get more travel vaccination information as well as where to find travel vaccinations at CDC's Travelers' Health Clinic page.
Immigrants, refugees and international adoptions
ImmigrantsWhether you are applying for an immigrant visa overseas or for legal permanent residence within the United States, you need to meet the vaccination criteria for U.S. immigration.
RefugeesRefugees are not required to have vaccinations before arrival in the United States, but you can start getting certain vaccinations through the vaccination program for U.S.-bound refugees.
International adoptions
Adoptees 10 years of age and under: Immigration law allows for adoptive parents to sign an affidavit stating they will be vaccinated after arrival to the United States.
Adoptees over 10 years of age: Immigration law requires proof of vaccination during the overseas medical examination.
Parents or close contacts traveling internationally to adopt a child: Make sure you are fully vaccinated according to CDC's ACIP recommendations. Some vaccine-preventable diseases, such as hepatitis A, are more common in other countries than the United States.
