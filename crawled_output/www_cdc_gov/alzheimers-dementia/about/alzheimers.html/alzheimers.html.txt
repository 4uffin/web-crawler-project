About Alzheimer's
Key points
Alzheimer’s disease is the most common type of dementia.
Early symptoms typically appear after age 60, and the risk increases with age.
Learn more about Alzheimer's disease, including who it affects, warning signs, and what to do if you think you or a loved one might have it.
Overview
Alzheimer’s disease
While some changes in memory and thinking are a normal part of aging, Alzheimer's is not.
Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of dementia.
Dementia is a general term for the loss of memory, problem-solving and thinking abilities that interferes with daily life.
Alzheimer's disease is...
A brain disorder caused by damage to nerve cells in the brain.
Progressive, meaning that it develops gradually over time.
It begins with mild memory loss and can lead to the inability to carry on a conversation, carry out daily activities, or respond to the environment.
Irreversible, meaning the damage it does to the brain cannot be undone.
Who gets Alzheimer's disease
The risk of getting this disease increases with age.
Alzheimer's typically affects people aged 60 or older.
Younger people can get Alzheimer's disease, but it is less common.
In some cases, early signs can appear as early as the mid-40s. This is known as early-onset Alzheimer's disease.
The number of people with Alzheimer’s disease
Did you know?
The number of people living with Alzheimer's is projected to double from 6.9 million in 2020 to nearly 14 million people by 2060.[9]
The burden of Alzheimer’s disease in the United States
Alzheimer's disease is a top 10 leading cause of death in the United States.[8] In 2022, it was the:
7th leading cause of death among U.S. adults.[8]
6th leading cause of death among adults 65 years or older.[8]
The actual number of older people who die from Alzheimer's may be much higher than what is officially recorded. Alzheimer's and other types of dementia are not always reported on death certificates.[7]
Causes
We do not yet fully understand what causes Alzheimer's disease. There likely is not one single factor, but rather a combination of factors that cause the disease. These factors, which may affect each person differently, include:
Genes.
Family history.
Environmental factors.
Lifestyle behaviors.
Signs and symptoms
Symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease
In addition to memory problems, someone with Alzheimer's disease may experience one or more of these problems:
Memory loss that disrupts daily life.
Trouble handling money or paying bills.
Difficulty completing familiar tasks at home, at work, or at leisure.
Decreased or poor judgment.
Misplacing things and being unable to retrace steps to find them.
Changes in mood, personality, or behavior.
Even if you or someone you know has several of these signs, it does NOT mean it's Alzheimer's disease.
Learn more about the 10 warning signs and consult your health care provider.

What to do if you think you might have Alzheimer’s
Talk to your health care provider to see if your symptoms are related to Alzheimer’s disease or a more treatable condition.
Early and accurate diagnosis may help slow the disease and help some symptoms.
Early diagnosis also allows you and your family to consider:
Treatment options.
Financial planning.
Advance directives.
Clinical trials.
Future care needs.
Early diagnosis is important for many reasons.
Risk factors
Risk reduction
Research suggests that people who adopt healthy lifestyle habits can lower the risk of memory loss or slow it down. These habits include staying physically active and keeping your heart healthy.
Treatment for Alzheimer’s disease
There is no known cure for Alzheimer's disease at this time. But getting proper medical care and treatment can improve the quality of life for people living with Alzheimer's.
Treatment can:
Help people maintain brain health.
Manage behavioral symptoms.
Slow or delay symptoms of the disease.
Treatment of Alzheimer’s depends on the underlying cause and the progression of the disease.
Prescription drugs have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). These drugs:
Temporarily ease some symptoms.
Can slow the disease from getting worse.
Typically work best for people in the early or middle stages of Alzheimer’s.
Medications don’t work for everyone, and they may lose effectiveness over time.
