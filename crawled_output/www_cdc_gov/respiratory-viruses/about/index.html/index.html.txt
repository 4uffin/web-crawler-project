About Respiratory Illnesses
Aug. 18, 2025
At a glance
Respiratory illnesses affect your lungs and airways, making it hard to breathe.
These illnesses share common symptoms, risk factors, and prevention strategies.
In the United States, we have more tools than ever before to help people protect themselves, their families, and communities from severe respiratory illnesses.
Overview
Even healthy people can get very sick from respiratory illnesses. In fact, last year, CDC estimated that at least 1 million people were hospitalized and more than 70,000 people died from respiratory virus illnesses.1
Common respiratory illnesses
Viral
Flu
COVID-19
RSV
Adenovirus
Rhinovirus/Enterovirus (common cold)
Parainfluenza
Parvovirus B19 (Fifth Disease)
Bacterial
Mycoplasma pneumoniae
Pneumococcal disease
Symptoms
Respiratory viruses may affect both the upper respiratory tract (the vocal cords and above) and the lower respiratory tract (below the vocal cords). Some viruses that affect the nose and throat can progress to cause serious lung infections, such as pneumonia.
Examples of symptoms affecting the respiratory tract:
Runny or stuffy nose
New loss of taste or smell
Sore throat
Cough
Other possible symptoms:
Headache
Muscle or body aches
Fever
Chills
Fatigue (tiredness)
Weakness
Decrease in appetite
Vomiting or diarrhea
What to do when you are sick
Stay home and away from others until all of your symptoms are getting better and you have not had a fever (without fever-reducing medication), for at least 24 hours. Resume normal activities and take extra precautions over the next five days.Preventing Spread of Respiratory Viruses When You're Sick
Risk factors
Respiratory illnesses can make anyone sick. However, some people have risk factors that can increase their chances of getting very sick (severe illness).
Age: Adults who are 65 years and older and children younger than 2 years old are usually at higher risk for getting very sick from respiratory illnesses.
Underlying conditions: Having medical conditions (for example, chronic lung disease, heart disease, diabetes, or chronic kidney disease), a weakened immune system, disability, and/or being pregnant are conditions that might increase your risk.
Prevention
There are actions you can take to help protect yourself and others from health risks caused by respiratory illnesses.
Core prevention strategies
CDC recommends that all people use these core measures to protect themselves and others from respiratory illnesses.
Stay up-to-date with immunizations, which are available for all three major fall and winter respiratory virus illnesses – flu, COVID-19, and RSV (for eligible groups). Talk to your doctor or trusted healthcare provider about what may be recommended for you and your family.
Practice good hygiene, like washing your hands and cleaning commonly touched surfaces.
Take steps for cleaner air— bringing in fresh outside air, purifying indoor air, or gathering outdoors—as possible in the places where people live and work.
When sick, use precautions to prevent the spread of illness and seek healthcare promptly for treatment if you are at higher risk for getting very sick from respiratory illnesses.
Additional prevention strategies
Additional actions can provide an extra layer of protection.
Actions like masking and physical distancing can help prevent being exposed to an illness or help reduce the spread if you're sick.
Tests are available that can quickly detect these respiratory viruses, so patients don't delay treatment and other actions that can protect their family, friends, and coworkers.
Treatment
Treatment with antiviral medication can reduce severe illness, hospitalization, and death. Flu and COVID-19 treatments are widely available and are recommended for those at higher risk for severe illness. Treatments for flu and COVID-19 work best when taken as soon as possible.
Did you know?
Antivirals are taken for viral infections like flu and COVID-19. Antibiotics are taken for bacterial infections. Antiviral medications and antibiotics are not sold over the counter in the United States. You can only get these medications if you have a prescription from a health care provider.
