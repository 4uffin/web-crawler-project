Statement from Laura Chanchien ParajÃ³n, MD, MPH, Director (Acting), CDC's National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, on the passing of Michael Fletcher,Â Tips From Former SmokersÂ®Â participant
Statement
For immediate release: September 18, 2025
CDC Media Relations(404) 639-3286media@cdc.govhttps://www.cdc.gov/media/
We are deeply saddened by the passing of Michael "Mike" Fletcher, a participant in CDC's Tips From Former Smokers® campaign and a devoted husband, father, stepfather, grandfather, brother, and friend to many.
We will always remember Mike for his courageous commitment to warn others about the devastating effects of cigarette smoking. He proudly became a spokesperson for the Tips campaign in 2019. He was passionate about helping others understand the real consequences of smoking and the importance of quitting. His story undoubtedly saved lives and inspired many smokers to quit before facing similar struggles.
We extend our deepest condolences to Mike's family, his friends, and all who cared about him.
