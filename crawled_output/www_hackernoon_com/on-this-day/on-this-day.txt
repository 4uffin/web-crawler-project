Fahlman proposed the use of emoticons as a way of indicating humor or sarcasm in text-based online communication, which could otherwise be easily misunderstood. The idea quickly caught on and the use of emoticons, and later emojis, has since become ubiquitous in online communication across various platforms and devices. Fahlman's innovation has not only helped to improve the clarity of online communication, but has also become a cultural phenomenon in its own right.US-led Invasion Restores Democracy to Haiti 1994 In 1994, the United States led a multinational invasion of Haiti with the aim of restoring democracy to the island nation. The invasion was prompted by the overthrow of democratically elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in a military coup three years earlier. The U.S.-led intervention, known as Operation Uphold Democracy, involved over 20,000 troops and succeeded in restoring Aristide to power. While the invasion was generally seen as a success, it also highlighted the complexities and challenges of interventionism, particularly in relation to questions of sovereignty and the role of outside powers in the internal affairs of other nations. New Zealand Grants Women's Suffrage 1893New Zealand's decision to grant women the right to vote in 1893 was a groundbreaking moment in the history of women's suffrage and a significant step towards gender equality. The campaign for women's suffrage in New Zealand was led by the Women's Christian Temperance Union and other women's groups, who argued that women deserved the same political rights as men. Despite opposition from some quarters, the bill was passed by the New Zealand parliament and signed into law by the governor in September 1893. This paved the way for women's suffrage movements around the world, and New Zealand remains a global leader in women's rights and gender equality to this day. ❯ 2024 View all❮Hono - A Cutting-Edge Backend Framework for Cloud-Native ApplicationsPublished on September 19, 202438 Lifehacks From "Tools of Titans" by Tim FerrissPublished on September 19, 2024How to Setup a Self-hosted Newsletter Using ListmonkPublished on September 19, 2024Xandeum To Unveil Solana Scaling Solution, XAND Token Launch And Liquid Staking At Breakpoint 2024Published on September 19, 2024Polkadot Upgrades With Agile Coretime For Resource Allocation, Unlocking Efficiency And ScalabilityPublished on September 19, 2024US Dollar-Pegged "USDN" (US Deez Nuts) Promises To Penetrate Volatile Market, Fails SpectacularlyPublished on September 19, 2024Skeptical To Sold: The 4-Stage Content Marketing Hack No Tech Startup Should IgnorePublished on September 19, 2024Educational Byte: Electronic Money vs. CryptocurrencyPublished on September 19, 2024Aembit Unveils 2024 Survey Report Highlighting Major Gaps In Securing Non-Human IdentitiesPublished on September 19, 2024❯ 2023 View all❮Achieving Excellence With Less Stress: A Simple Guide to SuccessPublished on September 19, 2023How to Use Contracts in Obyte: Smart, Prosaic, and With ArbitrationPublished on September 19, 2023Increasing Startup Revenue Cost-Effectively: Four Channels That WorkPublished on September 19, 2023WordPress UX: Make Your WordPress Website More User-FriendlyPublished on September 19, 2023How to Set up a Bidirectional Jira GitHub IntegrationPublished on September 19, 2023Mastering Secure Handling of API Keys and Credentials in CI/CD WorkflowPublished on September 19, 2023Copilot Does Not Assert Ownership of the Code it GeneratesPublished on September 19, 2023Ranting as a Front-End Developer: Skills, Expectations, and the Full Stack JourneyPublished on September 19, 2023Transforming Vim to a Complete IDE with NeoVim: From Laggy to EfficientPublished on September 19, 2023❯ 2022 View all❮Is Quick and Easy The Right Play in Business Growth?Published on September 19, 2022A Digital-First Approach Could Take the Headaches Away from Buying InsurancePublished on September 19, 2022Data Mesh - A Contrarian ViewPublished on September 19, 2022Hacks n' StuffPublished on September 19, 2022Things to Learn as a Novice Programmer to Find a Good Job QuicklyPublished on September 19, 2022The Count of Monte Cristo, Illustrated: Chapter 59 - The WillPublished on September 19, 2022The Noonification: Cryptos Vaporware Problem (9/19/2022)Published on September 19, 2022Why Probability Is ImportantPublished on September 19, 2022Moby-Dick; or The Whale: Chapter 76 -The Battering-RamPublished on September 19, 2022❯ 2021 View all❮Meet the Writer: "I Want to Make Sure What I Write is Accessible," says Joanelle TohPublished on September 19, 2021The Brain Power of a Headless CMSPublished on September 19, 2021How to Build Your Startup's Brand on LinkedInPublished on September 19, 2021How to Track an IP Address from an Email: Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail?Published on September 19, 2021How Decentralised Prediction Markets (DPMs) Tap into the Wisdom of the Crowds Published on September 19, 2021How Apple’s Upcoming Private Relay Feature Will Affect End Users and The VPN MarketPublished on September 19, 2021The Containerized Software Development GuidePublished on September 19, 2021❯ 2020 View all❮Insight Into TCP/UDP, Network Vulnerabilities and Defense ApproachesPublished on September 19, 2020Deep Vs.
