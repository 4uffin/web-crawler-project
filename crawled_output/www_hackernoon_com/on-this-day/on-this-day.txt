It was based on the Mach kernel and included several advanced features, such as object-oriented programming, a graphical user interface, and support for networking and multimedia. NeXTSTEP was originally designed for NeXT's own line of workstations, but it also gained popularity among developers who appreciated its powerful development tools and support for multiple programming languages. While NeXT Computer did not achieve widespread commercial success, NeXTSTEP proved influential in the development of other operating systems, particularly Mac OS X, which was based on NeXTSTEP's successor, OPENSTEP. ICANN Formed to Oversee Internet Governance 1998The creation of ICANN in 1998 marked a significant step in the global management and governance of the internet. Prior to its formation, key functions such as the management of domain name system (DNS) and IP address allocation were directly controlled by the US government. However, ICANN was established as a non-profit organization with the aim of assuming these responsibilities and promoting a more decentralized and international approach to internet governance. Today, ICANN continues to oversee these critical tasks, as well as promoting the development and accessibility of the internet across the globe through various initiatives and policies. U.S. Air Force Established as Separate Branch 1947The establishment of the U.S. Air Force in 1947 marked a major milestone in the history of American military aviation. Prior to this, the air component of the United States armed forces had been part of the U.S. Army, but the creation of a separate branch reflected the increasing importance of air power in modern warfare. The U.S. Air Force has since played a critical role in a wide range of conflicts and operations, from the Korean and Vietnam Wars to more recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Today, it remains the largest and most technologically advanced air force in the world. ‚ùØ 2024 View all‚ùÆBitcoin‚Äôs Centralization Threat: How Financial Giants and Coinbase Risk Undermining the RevolutionPublished on September 18, 2024Laxmi Sarat Chandra Nunnaguppala Advances Cybersecurity With AI and Machine Learning SolutionsPublished on September 18, 2024The World Before AIPublished on September 18, 2024ERC-7726: Never Code an Oracle in Ethereum AgainPublished on September 18, 2024Creators Gain Monetization Tools as Phaver Releases $SOCIAL TokenPublished on September 18, 2024Chromia Announces $20 Million Fund and 'Asgard' Upgrade to Integrate AI into BlockchainPublished on September 18, 2024Ledger Stax Review: An Innovative Wallet for Asset StoragePublished on September 18, 2024AI Alignment: What Open Source, for LLMs Safety, Ethics and Governance, Is Necessary?Published on September 18, 2024Preventing Greedy Transaction Selection: RTS and Fixed Fee SolutionsPublished on September 18, 2024‚ùØ 2023 View all‚ùÆThe OpenAI and Codex Lawsuit: Everything You Need to Know Explained By OpenAI ItselfPublished on September 18, 2023The Issues That OpenAI Has With the Lawsuit and Why It Believes It Should Be DismissedPublished on September 18, 2023OpenAI's Motion to Dismiss: The Notice They Put Out to the WorldPublished on September 18, 2023Logical Empathy: Lessons I Learned in Tech and How to Foster ItPublished on September 18, 2023AR and VR Training: Leveraging CapabilitiesPublished on September 18, 2023How Open Banking Helps Bridge the Financial Divide for Gig WorkersPublished on September 18, 2023OpenAI's Motion to Dismiss the Lawsuit: Why They Think They Should Be Let Off the Hook Published on September 18, 2023Unity vs Unreal: The Game Engine Battle for Apple Vision Pro Published on September 18, 2023From Knight Rider to Reality: Talking Cars are HerePublished on September 18, 2023‚ùØ 2022 View all‚ùÆLogging in Observability - Part 2Published on September 18, 2022Asked for a Parka, Got an ‚ÄúError 429: Too Many Requests‚ÄùPublished on September 18, 2022Ensuring Token Appreciation: Reflections on the Exchange Equation Published on September 18, 2022Metaverse EntertainmentPublished on September 18, 2022The Evolution of Smart-Cities With AI and Blockchain TechnologyPublished on September 18, 2022Who Sets Bitcoin‚Äôs Price and What Gives Cryptocurrencies Their Value?
