I did it in an hour or two."Preston ZellerChief Growth Officer, BatchDataOverviewPreston Zeller, Chief Growth Officer of BatchData, exemplifies how business leaders can leverage Replit to build enterprise-grade solutions that would traditionally require significant development resources and budget. Over the course of several months, Preston created three impressive applications that collectively save his company tens of thousands of dollars annually:A full-featured CPQ system with authentication, role-based permissions, custom product SKUs, and automated approval workflows â€” functionality that would easily cost $50,000+/year if purchased from vendors like Salesforce or Conga.A social listening platform that replaces $12,000+/year enterprise solutions for just $30 in build costsProfessional real estate calculators that would have taken his developer a week to build, completed in 1-2 hoursBut Preston's journey to these remarkable results began with familiar operational challenges that were slowing down BatchData's innovation.The challengeBatchData, a real estate data and technology company in the PropTech space, faced several operational challenges. As Chief Growth Officer overseeing sales, marketing, and revenue operations, Preston Zeller identified three critical pain points:Complex quote generation: Their sales team was struggling with an antiquated quoting process for custom API products and data delivery. "Our sales guys are often really stuck in looking at this huge data dictionary, deciphering what they might need," Preston explained. "There has to be a better way."Developer resource constraints: With limited development resources, Preston needed a way to build solutions without distracting his technical team from core product work.Choosing ReplitPreston had experimented with other app builders but found them too rigid. "It needed to be more malleable versus like, OK, I need a database and then I need to figure out how it's going to look."Replit stood out for several key reasons:Full-stack simplicity: "The full stack and deploy feature, database feature, and all that kind of being wrapped into one, which is a missing component of some of the other ones"Speed to market: "Speed and efficiency is of high value. If I can create something that is guided by a good idea and refine it in a shorter period of time, why not?"Development flexibility: The ability to iterate quickly without complex integrations or lengthy development cyclesBuilding with ReplitPreston built three major applications that transformed Batch Data's operations:1. Enterprise CPQ (Configure Price Quote) systemA fully-featured quote generation platform with:Complex product configuration for tiered subscription packagesMulti-stage approval workflows with Slack notificationsClient management and user permissionsCustom pricing logic for bulk data and per-record pricingProfessional PDF quote generation with company branding2. Real estate investment calculators suiteA collection of professional-grade calculators including DSCR, fix-and-flip, and ROI calculators with PDF export functionality, tooltips for technical terms, and color-coded results based on performance brackets.3. Social Pulse â€” AI-powered social listening toolA comprehensive social monitoring system that tracks competitor mentions across Reddit, YouTube, and Twitter, with intelligent filtering by subreddit and keyword targeting. The tool pushes notifications directly to Slack and includes sentiment analysis.Value realizedThe impact is substantial:ðŸ’° Massive cost savingsCPQ system: $250 total build cost vs $50,000+/year enterprise solutions = $50K+ annual savingsSocial listening: $30/month vs $1,000+/month enterprise tools = $12K+ annual savings
âš¡ Dramatic time savingsSales team efficiency: Streamlined quote generation eliminates hours of manual work per quoteReal estate calculators: Built in 1â€”2 hours vs 1 week of developer time ðŸŽ¯ Get more value with exactly what you need"Building these tools in Replit allows for flexibility to work specifically for our organization while not overpaying for features we'll never use due to being locked in by vendors' rigid pricing and packaging." Preston built exactly what his team needed without paying for enterprise bloat.ðŸš€ Competitive advantageThe social listening tool enables proactive competitor engagement, while the CPQ system provides professional quotes that close deals faster.Looking forwardPreston sees Replit as enabling a fundamental shift in how organizations operate: "Everyone within organizations are either going to be overseeing technology chains that are working on their own, or you're going to be involved in creating and innovating those technologies."For BatchData, Replit has become the go-to platform for rapid innovation, allowing them to build custom solutions that give them a competitive edge while keeping costs minimal and iteration cycles fast.About BatchDataBatchData is a real estate data and technology company in the PropTech space, providing custom API products and data delivery solutions to real estate professionals and investors.Handy LinksAbout usVibe Coding 101HelpHow to guidesImport from GitHubStatusAdditional resourcesBrand kitPartnershipsLegalTerms of serviceCommercial agreementPrivacySubprocessorsDPAReport abuseConnectX / TwitterTiktokFacebookInstagramLinkedinScroll to topAll rights reserved.
