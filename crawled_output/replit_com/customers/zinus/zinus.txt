The company was spending $40,000 annually on third-party QA software that fell short of their needs.When exploring a custom solution through traditional development channels, the quoted costs were exactly $112,050—plus an estimated three months of development time.Mason had been using Replit for over two years, watching its evolution from a simple cloud IDE into what he now describes as "an AI-powered coding platform."He wondered if Replit could offer a third option beyond the traditional build-or-buy dilemma."Before [Replit], we had to pay a bunch of contractors for manual quality analysis. It took so much time—it could take weeks even."Mason KimGlobal DevOps Engineer at ZinusThe Solution: Build Their Own Conversation IQ ToolInstead of starting with detailed requirements documents or wireframes, Mason and Joshua took a more direct approach.They explained their needs to Replit Agent, which helped them quickly create and refine working code to:Analyze customer service conversations with various AI modelsGenerate performance metrics and rankings for agentsVisualize data through customized charts and dashboardsStore conversation data in a database"When the team first saw it, they were just surprised with how fast we were able to produce results. That gives us more time for extra feedback and implementing more stuff that they want."Joshua CortezSoftware Engineer at ZinusThe Process: Fast, Iterative Development With Replit AgentTheir development process embraced an organic, conversational flow—quite literally talking with Replit Agent as if it were a teammate.Unlike traditional coding, they simply described what they wanted in plain English. Mason and Joshua would explain their requirements conversationally, and Replit Agent would understand the context and generate fully-functioning prototypes.The development cycle looked like this:They described the data structure and desired functionality to Replit AgentAgent generated initial code for their React frontend with Material UI componentsThey reviewed, adjusted, and refined the code in real-timeAs new ideas emerged, they implemented them immediatelyWhen encountering challenges, they described them to Agent, which offered solutionsThis rapid, iterative approach allowed them to evolve their application in just 1.5 months rather than the estimated 3 months it would have taken through a professional agency."We created a simple voting tool for the team. Everyone could test the different models on real conversations and vote for the one that gave the best analysis."Joshua CortezSoftware Engineer at ZinusA Pragmatic, Hybrid ArchitectureThe team designed a practical architecture that balanced security, usability, and development speed.The frontend was built entirely with Replit, leveraging React and Material UI components to create a modern, responsive interface—without requiring extensive React expertise.For security, they maintained a separate API to handle sensitive customer data, while still taking advantage of Replit's capabilities.The system used a Replit-hosted database to store analyzed conversations, performance metrics, and historical trends.The application included several sophisticated features:A model comparison framework for testing different AI models (ChatGPT, GPT-4, Gemini)Custom analytics dashboards with filterable data viewsIndividual agent performance metrics and rankingsBatch analysis capabilities for processing multiple conversationsHistorical trending to track improvements over timeData-Driven Testing and RefinementOne particularly interesting feature the team built was a voting system to determine which AI model performed best for their specific use case.This approach exemplifies their entire project philosophy: build quickly, get real feedback, and refine based on actual data and user experience.Their rapid development cycle allowed them to incorporate feedback immediately, without waiting for the next sprint or release cycle.One-Click DeploymentAnother advantage of building with Replit was the simplified deployment process.This seamless path from development to production meant the team could focus on functionality rather than deployment pipelines or infrastructure configuration.As they refined the application, new versions were deployed with minimal effort.The Results: $140,000+ Saved and 50% Reduction in Development TimeWhen Mason and Joshua presented their completed tool to the team, the reaction was immediate and enthusiastic.The business impact was significant:$112,050 saved in one-time external development costs$40,000 saved in annual recurring third-party software expensesDevelopment time reduced by 50% — from 3 months to just 1.5 monthsAnalysis time reduced from weeks to minutesImproved agent performance through faster feedback cyclesA foundation for future internal tool developmentNew Developer Experience, New PossibilitiesFor Mason and Joshua, the experience changed how they think about development."It's a really great tool to help enhance our current skill sets," says Mason. By accelerating the initial development process, they created space for the iteration and refinement that truly makes software valuable.Rather than spending months building to a rigid specification, they could rapidly evolve their application based on real user feedback.What's Next for Zinus: Building on their Replit SuccessThe team is already planning enhancements to their Conversation IQ tool:Export functionality for analytics dataAdditional filtering capabilitiesWebhook integration for automatic analysisIntegration with internal network environmentsMore importantly, they've established a new model for internal development at Zinus by demonstrating that small teams can build sophisticated applications quickly and cost-effectively.For developers facing similar build-or-buy decisions, the Zinus case presents a compelling alternative: use AI-powered development with Replit to create custom solutions rapidly and cost-effectively while achieving the exact functionality your organization needs.P.s. check out the Zinus Green Tea Mattress collection: https://www.zinus.com/pages/compare-mattressHandy LinksAbout usVibe Coding 101HelpHow to guidesImport from GitHubStatusAdditional resourcesBrand kitPartnershipsLegalTerms of serviceCommercial agreementPrivacySubprocessorsDPAReport abuseConnectX / TwitterTiktokFacebookInstagramLinkedinScroll to topAll rights reserved.
