They can now create functional prototypes without waiting for engineering resources.Professional Services DirectorThe challengeA leading commerce solutions provider in Latin America, specializing in custom commerce platforms through WhatsApp integration for major brands like Unilever and Coca-Cola, faced a critical gap between solution design and implementation.Their professional services team struggled with several key obstacles:Technical knowledge without execution ability — Solution architects possessed deep technical understanding but lacked coding expertise to build functional prototypes without engineering supportEngineering bottlenecks slowed delivery — As one development lead noted: "Our solution architects had great ideas but were completely dependent on our limited engineering resources to bring them to life"Weeks of waiting for simple concepts — Architects would wait weeks for engineering time just to test basic ideasThis dependency on engineering resources significantly slowed client delivery and limited the company's ability to scale their operations.Choosing ReplitThe company chose Replit Agent as a bridge between technical knowledge and implementation, specifically to empower their solution architects to create without coding expertise. Key decision factors:Natural language to code — Replit Agent's ability to generate code based on natural language instructions perfectly matched their needsSelf-sufficiency for architects — "We chose Replit Agent because it allows our solution architects to be self-sufficient. They understand the technical requirements but don't need to be programmers to create solutions," explained a company executiveTemplate customization — Ability to create frameworks that non-coders could easily modify for different clientsBuilding with ReplitThe company implemented a comprehensive strategy to integrate Replit Agent across their workflow:Prototype creation capabilities — Trained solution architects to leverage Replit Agent for building functional prototypes independentlySelf-sufficient workflow — Established processes where architects could create and iterate independently without engineering supportWhatsApp commerce integrations — Built custom commerce platforms integrated with WhatsApp for major consumer brands"Our solution architects can now sit with a client, understand their needs, and create a working prototype before the meeting ends. This was simply impossible before Replit Agent," explains their Professional Services Director.Value realizedThe implementation of Replit Agent has fundamentally transformed how the company delivers solutions:Thousands of hours saved — Eliminated weeks of coordination between architects and engineers70% reduction in bottlenecks — Decreased engineering dependency has dramatically improved delivery speedImproved margins and revenue — As the Professional Services Director notes: "Replit Agent has improved our margins and helped us drive more revenue"Looking forward, the company plans to expand this capability by creating more templates that solution architects can customize with Replit Agent. They're developing a comprehensive training program to further empower non-coding technical staff and exploring ways to extend this approach to client teams.Handy LinksAbout usVibe Coding 101HelpHow to guidesImport from GitHubStatusAdditional resourcesBrand kitPartnershipsLegalTerms of serviceCommercial agreementPrivacySubprocessorsDPAReport abuseConnectX / TwitterTiktokFacebookInstagramLinkedinScroll to topAll rights reserved.
