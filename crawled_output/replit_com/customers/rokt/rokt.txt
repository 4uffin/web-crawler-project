In a single day, 700+ employees globally built 135 fully functional applications—transforming internal operations at unprecedented speed.The challenge: scaling operations 5X“We set a goal to remove all friction that prevented us from operating 5x faster.” — Jon Humphrey, SVP of Solutions and Operations, RoktWith AI becoming ubiquitous, Rokt knew they would need to operate 5X faster to continue to accelerate its business. To do this, they identified key areas of friction in the business, such as hiring, democratizing analytics and knowledge, friction between their core systems of record and more. Tools like Replit presented them the opportunity to tackle these challenges rapidly."Since then, we started to see a lot of our people operations get managed via Replit dashboards. Our financial monthly close is now supported by having Replit. Our legal task trackers get managed in Replit dashboards and applications. And now we're even venturing into the world of actually managing and prioritizing over 30,000 tasks that come through our operations team each year via custom built Replit engines."Jon HumphreySVP of Solutions and Operations, RoktDiscovering Replit: from notepad to game-changing appsJon and his colleague initially discovered Replit on X:“We stumbled upon Replit and started to build a notepad — that was done in a few seconds.
