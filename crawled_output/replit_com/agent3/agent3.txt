Introducing Agent 3Agent 3App TestingTest. Fix. Retest.Agent 3 now tests and fixes its code, constantly improving your application behind the scenes in a reflection loop. Agent 3 will test its work, make improvements, and test again. Our proprietary testing system is up to 3x faster and 10x more cost-effective than Computer Use models.
Longer Run TimeRun. Run. Done.Agent 3 runs on its own for up to 200 minutes, handling full tasks autonomously. â¨Agent 3 understands your aspiration with simple prompts in natural language. Once you give it instructions, it will go work autonomously for hours, giving you time back. Â You can track your projectâs progress, in real time, from anywhere, with Live Monitoring right â¨on your phone.
Agent GenerationAutomate. Delegate. Accelerate.For the first time ever, Agent 3 can build other agents and automations. â¨That means you can automate complex and repetitive workflows using natural language. â¨You can then interact with your own Agents by integrating them into platforms like email or Slack. â¨The net outcome is an increase in your efficiency and productivity.
