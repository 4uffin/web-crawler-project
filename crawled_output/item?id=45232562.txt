My uncle turned up drunk for my wedding reception. He’d got the venue wrong and had already spent an hour at a different wedding reception eating and drinking, easy to do at Indian weddings with a huge number of guests.But that’s only half the story. He’d got the date wrong too, and had already done the whole thing the night before.replyBLKNSLVR 11 hours ago

Something like this has also happened to me when in holiday in Spain. I was looking around nice buildings open to the public, and entered one that I later found out happened to be a university. Walking around I entered one very well decorated hall, also because it started to rain and had to wait somewhere until it passed. To my horror, more people started coming in as well and I realized I was in for some sort of book or thesis presentation on the subject of Spanish language on the Balearic islands.I barely speak Castilian Spanish (the more common one) and it was instead in Catalan Spanish, so I didn't understand a word, but stayed for the 1-2 hours it took, clapped, and skipped the handshakes/signing part of it.replySenHeng 11 hours ago

I had a similar experience in Monza, Italy. Was taking a walk around some old church and a guy was giving an explanation in English so I stopped to listen. They started ushering the entire group into the crypts underground so I just went with the flow.While showing us where the dead bodies were stored the guy said something like “but you’re all doctors so I’m sure you’re used to it” was when I realised this was an organised event.I thought this was the difference between the laid back European culture vs the more, um… detailed mindset of the Far east one I grew up in. The Italians probably didn’t care if there were strays while the Singaporean or Japanese organisers would be doing a headcount at every stop.replyJaumeGreen 10 hours ago

FYI naming it Catalan Spanish would be akin to naming Welsh as Welsh English. Catalan and Spanish (also known as Castilian) are two different languages, like French and Italian.So it's normal that you didn't understand much, as even it having some words that are similar the tonalities and some of the constructs are very different.And they might have been speaking in Balearic, which is a Catalan dialect, and that's sometimes even harder to understand.replyxanderlewis 10 hours ago

I don’t think it is akin; Welsh is almost completely different to English with only a few modern words in common. Just try reading some Welsh as an English speaker. It’s unintelligible.Catalan is very much a Latinate language, and anyone who speaks Spanish or Italian or French (or even English) can guess the meaning of a lot of words and understand the grammar quite easily.replyFreak_NL 9 hours ago

Doug Englebart and Ted Nelson came to give a lecture at my university when I was a student. I was busy in the lab and engrossed in my work, and realised the time 5 minutes after the talk was due to begin. I was too embarrassed to walk in late, so to my eternal regret I didn't go.

I attended a funeral for the family member of a friend of mine. After the funeral we all were to convene at his sister's house. Because of the crowds I parked half a block away and found myself in a group of similarly dressed people walking towards what I remembered to be her house. After maybe 5 minutes of not recognizing anyone, someone simply says "who are you", and after explaining my relation to the deceased, my error became apparent.replyzduoduo 13 hours ago

Many years ago I took a look at my high school senior yearbook for the first time since I’d graduated. I spotted a note from a girl asking me to call her after graduation.I didn’t remember the name (first name only), and the phone number was from a different town 20-30 miles from my high school. Unfortunately I don’t believe I still have the yearbook, so it shall forever remain a mystery. I literally had, and have, no clue.replypif 19 hours ago

I'm not sure I understand this correctly but did they mean just the wedding and not the wedding reception?In my corner of the world it's still fairly normal to have people attempt to crash a wedding reception and it's typically the role of the best man to bribe them with offerings like a shot of vodka or treats.I have a distinct memory of my friend's father in law, a man close to 2m tall, walking forward, vodka bottle in one hand, shot glass in the other, while the uninvited guest, with just a shot glass, walking backwards towards the gate to the venue where the reception was held.On the flip side one night over a decade ago I was out on a walk with my SO when we overheard some rowdy people. We wanted to avoid them, but they caught up to us and it turned out that this was an after-party after their wedding reception. They invited us to join them to enjoy the leftovers with everyone.replyjs2 22 hours ago

this happened to my mother-in-law, where she was the crasher.in North London there is a large Turkish centre that hosts Turkish weddings. She was invited to a wedding there.Traditionally, the bride and groom stand in the centre of the room and then family members lineup next to them all in a procession.As you enter the room to reach the bride and groom, you must shake the hands in turn of all of the people in the procession.When my mother-in-law eventually got to the bride and groom, they realised that the bride and groom were strangers. The accurate wedding was taking place upstairs at the same time.There are multiple wedding venues in that particular Turkish Centre.replyfoobarian 23 hours ago

A student once arrived, disheveled and with 20 minutes left, to a midterm.
I gave him a stern look and a copy of the exam.
While I was grading the exam, I discovered with slight horror that he'd showed up to the first of two classes that I was teaching back to back in the same room -- he was enrolled in the second, and had arrived 30 minutes early.
Horror turned to joy as I failed to find a single error on his exam.
We had a good laugh as I returned his exam; he was justifiably proud and only slightly embarrassed.replymythrwy 17 hours ago

I had a roommate back in college that was a devoutly religious catholic. We went out drinking one Saturday night and he started talking about church (I was and still am irreligious). He convinced me to go with him to mass the next morning.Next morning we get up, get dressed, drive to the church and walk in all hung over. I hadn't ever been in a catholic church before but it was a huge crowd already seated and there were no seats in the back. The priest was up front speaking. So we walk through the pews looking for a seat and get all the way to the front before we find one. Everyone is staring at us. We sit down. The priest said a few words and I think there was a prayer and like 5 minutes after we sat down everyone got up to leave.It was daylight savings time change and we hadn't adjusted our clocks being drunk college students. That was my one experience attending mass.replyantonymoose 1 day ago

When I was an intern years ago I went to an event at a hotel in LA. I didn't know what room the event was in, so I approached the concierge, described the event I was there for, and he immediately whisked me to an upper floor, where I began to talk with the other guests. It took about 10 minutes for me to realize that while the people there were also interns, and we were in the same field, they were from a particular company, whereas my event was for an industry group. They had just been flown in from all over the country, so it didn't seem odd to them to see a new face (we were all new faces).I eventually realized the error and quietly excused myself to look for the industry group meeting (which sadly lacked the delicious catered food and open bar that the first event had). Fortunately I made my exit before the higher-ups had arrived, as they would have quickly realized I was in the wrong place.replyfranze 9 hours ago

We would probably have much higher unemployment and slower-moving industries, and might no longer be the economic powerhouse of the world.When it's simple and easy to fire people, companies are a lot more willing to take a chance on hiring somebody they aren't 100% sure will be a good employee, and willing to hire a lot and grow fast knowing in both cases they can fire easily if needed.I find it sad that so many people never think about the second and third-order consequences of what sounds like feel-good policies.

You're welcome to disagree, I don't mind some competition.> Just proof hire them for 6 months to a year.As is common with most quickly tossed out "tiny fixes" to Socialist policies of excessive regulation, this makes the whole thing more complex and doesn't really solve the full problem for either workers or companies the way true free markets do. The only real "just" is just stop meddling with what everyone else does, let workers quit and companies fire whenever they want to.> Your argument doesn't hold for someone that has worked for 10 years. If they were a bad hire; it's on you at that point.Yes it does. It's not necessarily only that they're a bad hire. They could have the wrong skills or temperament or something for where the company needs to go, or the company could need to shut down a whole department or something. I don't know, the world has infinite complexity and possibility. I'm not smart enough to come up with everything anyone could ever want to do, and frankly, neither are you or anyone else.> Easier planning life and reduce work anxiety for employees.That sounds like a personal problem. I don't care to reshape national policy to cater to someone's alleged anxiety.> It encourage companies to invest and train their existing employees since they're hard to get rid off.Eh maybe, but many companies still do that now because good people are still hard to find. That's the better and more reliable way to do all of these things.> It makes employees less scared to speak up or discuss problems.Plenty already do that, I don't think it's much of a point. It's not really proven any more than the counter-statement that it makes employees more willing to slack off.> It makes companies more cautious about reckless hiring if they're not sure about their economics.That's exactly my point. I think it's good to let them "recklessly" hire if they think they can afford it. Some will get things right and grow huge, other will fail and those workers will be able to find new jobs more easily.> Allows older workers to remain productive for longer, reducing the burden on the pension or unemployment system from people 55+ having a hard time finding new work for few years before retirement."Allow" how? They can already do that fine. Many companies value the experience of older workers just fine without the Government forcing them to do things. And I'd rather they have a comfortable retirement already set up from a robust investment market, possibly with a 401k or something like that. I don't want them to be dependent on either one company or the Government.And intentionally saving this for last along with the end:> If they're is such a massive difference we would see alot less globally competetive European companies.> Finally, i must ask what the societal purpose of jobs and companies are.

There is a balance to these things ofourse, but dismissing it outright is not fair."much less competitive European companies" is exactly what I do see, and you are also arguing that that's a good thing. Europe seems to have very little in the way of invention or growth pretty much since WWII. They haven't invented much new, and most of what they have invented has been eclipsed by more aggressive and nimble American companies. The European economy is still mostly dominated by the same large companies mostly doing the same things they've always done, sometimes adopting new technology long after American companies led the way.I'm not dismissing anything outright. I've carefully observed the results of both styles of economy and I prefer freer markets. I like helping lead the way towards creating awesome things thanks to everyone's free will. It's not always perfect, but the market usually fixes things faster and better than half-baked Government policies.replyaDyslecticCrow 6 hours ago

I know this is quite a deep cultural difference between Europe and USA going back ... probably since the the industrial revolution. I dont even think we can compare numbers and expect the same outcome if the US implemented european worker laws.One thing i am curious about though. Do you think worker unions are a good thing? Historically USA pioneered them, yet theyre nearly nonexistent today.The reason i ask is, Sweden where I'm from, does not actually have a miminum wage, or much of any worker protection codified in law. Its a more open market than people (even swedes) really realize. Its just that a we have a 68% unionizaion rate of all workers, 2nd highest in the world. Its the unions that have established much of the worker protections.> They haven't invented much new, and most of what they have invented has been eclipsed by more aggressive and nimble American companies.I think this is rather difficult to measure. Certainly it looks that way for the tech sector in particular.But europe also has a very high upstart per captia ratio. Its also there really common that small innovative european upstarts get bought up by international and American companies after passing 100-200 employees. We rarely see new giant corporations show up in europe before being absorbed.Though i also think if any of the US FANG companies were based in europe they would be shattered by monopoly protection laws at a heartbeat. Our ideals about a good company is simply different.replyufmace 15 minutes ago
| root | parent | next [–]
Yes, I suppose it is a deep cultural difference.My opinion on unions is mixed, I suppose. They may be necessary in some times, places, and industries to compel reasonable treatment of workers. If such things are necessary, they're probably better than government intervention due to being much closer to the actual workplace. Historically, they have been responsible for establishing some good practices as standard in the American workforce. But they also have their bad sides. They tend to encourage an excessively antagonistic relationship between workers and management, cause pay and promotions to depend only on seniority rather than skill and work ethic, make it impractical to terminate workers who are ridiculously lazy or toxic, force everyone to take the same benefits whether they want them or not, enforce ridiculous rules about who can do what when, and other such things. They probably deserve at least some of the blame for the fall from grace of American automobile manufacturing due to things like being unwilling to accept greater factory automation even if it may lead to fewer workers needed, thus making the whole company less competitive.I suppose in my ideal economy, I'd expect around 10-30% unionization, with the rest of the workers treated reasonably well due to a combination of market forces and threat of unionization. That's decently close to what we have in the US right now.I do find advocates of it in the US to be ridiculous at times. Like, okay maybe unions are necessary and beneficial sometimes, but I think software engineering is about the least in need of unionization of any career in the modern world. But still some people seem to be obsessed with the idea of it.Anti-monopoly regulation seems to be a mixed bag to me too, particularly in today's economy. Only 20-25 years ago, Microsoft was the big bad monster company, enough so that the US Government did start to look at using monopoly regulation against them a little bit. But the internet world and Google took the wind out of their sails better and faster than the Government could, and I think the tech world is better for it. FANG occupy similar economic space now, and I think it's likely that changing technology and market forces will again do a better job of knocking them back down a peg than the Government would.Europe certainly doesn't lack smart and ambitious people, but I think those attitudes of who is allowed to be "on top" in society and what a good company looks like holds them back. That's a legitimate tradeoff that the people of Europe are free to make of course, but I disagree that it's the ideal way to organize a society.reply93po 22 hours ago

That he isn't allowed to fire people he manages when he sees behavior or actions that don't align with what he wants in his orgs?Also, what exactly is the source of this information? I spent multiple minutes googling for an anecdote of him firing someone for a small nuissance, or firing someone and then not recognizing them later, or firing someone and then them getting surreptitiously moved to a different department.I'm fine if this actually happened, Elon definitely sucks.

The dig is three fold. (if the story is true, about which I have my doubts.)One: Elon instead of cultivating an organisation where the right people are rewarded and the wrong people are selected out tries to personally weed out the wrong ones. That is fundamentally foolish even if he is firing people who should be fired.Two: His subordinates don't respect his decision and instead of letting go the people he wanted to fire, they "hide" them in the organisation elsewhere.Three: He is too distracted / stupid / incompetent to then notice that his decision has been undermined.replyD-Coder 22 hours ago

That day, he learnt that an open door policy is a massive red herring and got reamed for disturbing the CEO. It was all performative - they don't actually care.replyHemospectrum 1 day ago

Something similar happened to me in college. I got to my class late, and there was only one seat left, in the middle of the row in the large auditorium, so I had to make a big commotion getting to it. I finally sit down and pull out my notes, only to realize that whatever this substitute teacher was talking about was totally Greek to me. After a while, it dawned on me - I wasn’t late for class, I was super early! Since I made such a commotion getting to the seat, and since I didn’t want to do that again, I just sat there and pretended to take notes. My class was the one after, and I left the room when everyone else did, went to the bathroom, then came back, just so no one would notice that I was going to the much more junior class right after. :Dreplymadaxe_again 23 hours ago

I am something of a professional gatecrasher, which is a skill I picked up from a friend many years ago.Interesting event happening as you’re walking past? Just walk on in, look like you belong, see where it goes. That or carry around a hi vis vest - they fold up tiny and can live in a jacket pocket unnoticeably, and they will allow you access anywhere. Occasionally I’ve had to doodle “STEWARD” or similar on the back. Back in the pocket once you’re in, or you’ll be rigging lighting or serving drinks.Through this I have ended up with friends, work, and anecdotes galore.I’ve also been chucked out of a few things but that’s definitely the minority - most of the time when people are like “so are you with the royal brigadiers…?” I’ll just say “no, I’m gatecrashing”, and they assume I’m joking until they realise I’m not, but by that point we’re already on our fourth round.replypavel_lishin 22 hours ago

I once did the Holloway Road pub crawl in London with a friend. At the final boozer, the end of level boss of the crawl, there was karaoke going in the back room so we put our names down and 10 minutes later we were up on stage singing Queen's Don't Stop Me Now incredibly badly. Mid-song, I noticed a massive pile of wedding presents under a table near the stage and realised we were at a stranger's wedding reception. The only thing we could do was to style it out and finish the song.replymathattack 19 hours ago

While Catalan speakers would be very unlikely to say "Catalan Spanish", there is a conception that there are many "lenguas españolas" (Spanish languages, as in languages that are part of the country of Spain). In this formulation even Basque is a "Spanish language" (as a language of Spain), even though it isn't linguistically related to Castilian Spanish.Notably, the constitution of Spain uses this phrasing in its article 3:1. El castellano es la lengua española oficial del Estado. Todos los españoles tienen el deber de conocerla y el derecho a usarla.2. Las demás lenguas españolas serán también oficiales en las respectivas Comunidades Autónomas de acuerdo con sus Estatutos.3. La riqueza de las distintas modalidades lingüísticas de España es un patrimonio cultural que será objeto de especial respeto y protección.In English:1. Castilian is the official Spanish language of the state. All Spaniards have the duty to know it and the right to use it.2. The other Spanish languages are also official in their respective Autonomous Communities, in accordance with their Statutes.3. The richness of the different linguistic modalities of Spain is a cultural heritage which shall be accorded particular respect and protection.I've heard a minority of (seemingly highly educated) people prefer to say "Castellano" instead of "Español", maybe as a deliberate reference to this concept.replynormie3000 20 hours ago

Not always. People from the center and west side of Spain typically refer to it as "español" rather than "castellano". Nonetheless, it's true educated people typically refer to it as "castellano" as well as other Spaniards that live in a region where other official languages are spoken.replydddgghhbbfblk 22 hours ago

While "Catalan Spanish" is certainly a nonstandard term, when contrasted against "Castilian Spanish" it does make some sense: it's the Romance variant that developed in the Catalonia part of Spain, vs the one that developed in Castile.replyRygian 22 hours ago

I see the point. But it hangs on a thin string. One more stretch and you'd get "west-side Spanish" for Portuguese, or some sort of "gaelic Spanish" for Occitan.replyted_dunning 21 hours ago

Regardless of how they might feel, they're still Spanish (hold a Spanish passport), so it's a true fact. I also take issue with you claiming that all Catalans feel this way, that's largely untrue.That being said, both terms "Castilian Spanish" and "Catalan Spanish" sound weird to me. Source: I'm both a Catalan and Spanish speaker. In my languages, they're both referred as "Castellano" o "Catalan".I'd appreciate that people referred to these languages either as Catalan or Spanish, no need for unnecessary qualifiers.

I'd say that, for example, there are significant enough pronunciation (and in a few cases, vocabulary) differences between Portuguese in Portugal vs Brazil.From experience, learning one is not the same as the other.So there are definitely contexts where these differences matter.replynormie3000 21 hours ago

Then, they can declare an independence war, and win that war. They can't have their cake and eat it.Something that not even the most stubborn separatists want to do, while enjoying the special treatment of "I feel oppressed under the weight of all this Spanish fiscal benefits that other Spaniards don't have".Until that war happens, saying I'm not Spanish, I'm from Catalonia, is like an American native from Oklahoma saying "I don't feel like an USA citizen, so I will not pay taxes but I will keep all the benefits, freedom of movement, etc that they have". Yes you are and US citizen. Feelings are irrelevant from a legal point of view. Stop acting like a child.

I learned Spanish in Madrid - there's definitely no Catalan dialect of Spanish - it's either/or. And the northeastern Spanish accent is perfectly understandable (unlike, say, Galicia or Andalusia).So it's surprising that OP thought Catalan was a version of Spanish, because it's completely unintelligible to anyone who learned Spanish as a second language (like myself) - not sure about native speakers. I can't even pronounce the street names in Barcelona when I visit.replynormie3000 20 hours ago

> it's completely unintelligible to anyone who learned SpanishThis is wild.
The languages share a lot of vocabulary and grammar.> I can't even pronounce the street names in Barcelona when I visit.This is also wild. I can see there are some words like "passeig" and "plaça" which aren't immediately familiar, but they're not far from the Spanish equivalents. And you could have a good shot at pronouncing many other streets like "Gran Via" and "Diagonal".replyrussellbeattie 16 hours ago

You can take a wild guess at the street names if you're reading them out loud, of course.But what do you do when someone tells you an address on a street like
Passatge di'Alió ("pasa je dia lio??"). You're not remembering that on the first try, you won't write it down correctly and later when you try to tell the taxista where to go they'll look at you like you're crazy. (This is from personal experience.)replygerdesj 20 hours ago

Scottish bloke rocks up to the wrong wedding, simple mistake.Top thread on HN riffs on Catalan independence.
To be fair, Scotland and Catalonia both cite each other as exemplars.For me, I'm fighting for Wessex's independence from England and hence Britain oh and the UK.
Eventually I'll fight for Somerset, then Yeovil and finally Brunswick Street.
Not sure how it will all work.Nominative tribalism can be a force for good or bad but rarely makes a useful contribution to an article about a daft mistake that has a heart warming finale.reply867-5309 19 hours ago
