England captain Harry Brook: "It was an amazing game the other night so it's a shame the weather has ruined it again."We only played one T20 game [in the series], which is a shame again, but the way we played the other night was phenomenal."So for us to be able to do that against a very strong South Africa side gives us a lot of confidence going forward."On hitting 300 and Salt's innings: "I completely believe in him to go out and perform like that, alongside Jos."I don't think it'll be the last time we get 300 with the batting line-up and talent we've got, we could do that three or four times."On white-ball team: "It's been good fun, first summer as captain so it's been different but we've got a really good group."We've had a really good summer and enjoyed."On what's next: "I've got about a month off before going to New Zealand then the Ashes."

South Africa captain Aiden Markram: "Tough one. Quick one the first time around, second one
completely outplayed so we had a lot of motivation today to put in a good
performance and rectify a few things."Frustration with the weather but not much we could do about
it."On lessons from Old Trafford: "There was quite a bit. From a planning point of view, you
have plans but on the day you might need to be adaptable and tap into some
skills you maybe wouldnât see yourself tapping into from two players are going like that."Lots of lessons from
Australia and into this tour as well. Weâre tracking towards that T20 World Cup and hopefully we can keep improving."On going from big highs to big lows: "It's a tough one, a good conversation to have within the group. It's about improving and building towards the World Cup."You want to win. Today was an exciting opportunity because it was a must-win game, it's never quite like a World Cup but as close as you can get. But can't do much about the weather."On Pakistan tour next: "Yes, a really good tour. Two or three weeks off first. Itâll
be its own unique set of challenges."

England batter Phil Salt: "Obviously it was good to put that performance in on Friday night but the feeling right now is frustration with the weather."We put them under pressure early [on Friday] and didn't let that up. It's nice when the game goes like that, it can go anywhere when things aren't going your way so it was about keeping the pressure on throughout."That's what can happen [getting out first ball in Cardiff] when the game is shortened like that, we needed to get out of the blocks quickly but it goes that way sometimes."I have a good partnership with Jos, it's nice to be back at the top of the order with him and he's someone I know very well."Ireland are a good team, they've had a lot of good results especially at home so we know we've got a job on our hands."

More from England coach Brendon McCullum: "Where were the sticking points? If youâre trying to assist these guys doing what they ended up doing, where are the points of difference? Some of it is removing some of the noise. We walked out on the first day of Lord's but what an opportunity. Itâs a great forum and a base to keep growing this game and hopefully what we want to succeed and our success can reach so many people.""For us, itâs a matter of trying to manage that noise so when you cross the line it doesn't affect you, you donât carry anything with you. There's good days and bad, itâs staying level, it's trying to create a camaraderie across the group and itâs trying to free up these guys so theyâre not paralysed by a fear of failure or a fascination with technique. Technique allows you to go into the game but itâs the ability to play the game, play the man and play the situation to adapt to get the outcome you want. Itâs not if you do everything perfectly. Thereâs an over-fascination with technique - all it does is create noise and warps our mind and affects our decisions in the moment and what needs to be done."

England coach Brendon McCullum on Test Match Special: "A lot is made of preparation. If we look at the Test side since I came on board. I donât have the exact answers of what makes us a good side but I donât think anyone does. If someone said if you follow this script youâll win five nil, youâll win. Then weâll do it. It would be great but no one has that. Youâve got to have good conviction about the things that you believe in. Since we came in, weâve won every away first Test match of each series and weâll follow the exact same preparation. It doesn't guarantee success but weâll be following it.""When I first came into the job with England cricket, looking in from the outside you can see that the talent within this country is significant and the love of this game is significant, the resources are good and the opportunity is immense."

Australia have sent an early statement ahead of the Women's World Cup with a comfortable eight-wicket win over India. Pratika Rawal, Smriti Mandhana and Harleen Deol all made half-centuries in India's 281-7 but the defending World Cup champions made light work of the chase.Phoebe Litchfield struck 88 from 80 balls at the top of the order before Beth Mooney (77 not out from 74) and Annabel Sutherland (54 not out from 51) added 116 for the third wicket to reach their target with 5.5 overs to spare.

England coach Brendon McCullum on Test Match Special: "There were a lot of things to be enthusiastic about from the summer. The India series was unbelievable to be a part of. Both teams gave as good as they've got. The cricket was fabulous. It was superbly supported all around England and all around the world. I thought it was a series that shows that Test cricket means a lot to people. It was great to be a part of. It was a shame we couldn't get over the line but things donât always go your way."Itâs not for the love of fielding why we were staying out there so long, thatâs for sure. It is unfortunate that the grounds were a touch docile for what we were anticipating. It was a hot summer and the amount of cricket that is played on these pitches probably makes it hard to keep the life in them. However, we had our chances throughout that series and we came within one blow of winning against a really strong Indian side who are very well-resourced and trained. There's a lot of positives to take from that series to take with us. Weâve got a white-ball series against New Zealand ahead of the Ashes. Then weâll be going to Perth and play against the Lions as our warm-up game.â

It is the defending champions who have sent a pretty strong message, however, in the opener.They are cruising to their target of 282, with Beth Mooney leading the charge after Phoebe Litchfield made 88 at the top of the order. You can find that scorecard here.

Er, I haven't got any of the team's analysis to bring you but Joe Root and Ben Stokes both get A*s.I think that's fair. Brendon McCullum has now joined the team for a chat. Again, we'll bring you some snippets from him but you can listen at the top of this page or on BBC Sounds.

It looks like an A for Harry Brook.Joe Root is up next and I don't think there will be much of a debate on this one.

I would give Harry Brook an A.

What we have learned about Harry Brook is that he was the right decision to make him the white-ball captain. I like the way he's taken on the role, I like the way he carries himself, he's very funky and he's really grown into the role. What I think we've also learned is that he is the future Test captain.
