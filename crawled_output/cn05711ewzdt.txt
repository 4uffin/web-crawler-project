More spin with leggie Abrar Ahmed into the attack and it's a tidy over.No boundaries and just six from it as the two new batters look to get themselves settled.That and Abrar kept a very tight line and mixed it up with a few googlies as well.

The runs have come quickly for India but Pakistan's decision to use Saim Ayub has worked in terms of bringing them wickets.Both openers gone, so it Suryakumar Yadav and Tilak Varma in the middle for India.

Abhishek Sharma is gone and it's a second for Saim Ayub.A pair of boundaries early in the over for the left-handed opener but he falls trying to hit over the top.He looks to be aiming over long-on but Saim drags his length back and a thick edge from Abhishek carries out to Faheem Ashraf, a few yards off the rope at long-off.Still a smidge of hope for Pakistan.

Again a solid end to the over from Shaheen Afridi, the problem is that he's getting pummelled in the first half.Suryakumar Yadav is out there with Abhishek Sharma now and India look to be in a hurry.

There's no stopping Abhishek Sharma!After flaying the first ball of the Shaheen Afridi over past backward point for four, he casually picks up the third and lifts it high over the leg side for a big six.

Interesting. Saim Ayub shares the new ball, bowling his off breaks.Just a pair of singles from the first three balls but Shubman Gill skips down to the ground and slaps it back down the ground for four.Four more! Beautiful shot over extra cover this time from Gill. Fantastic timing.

Much better end to the over from Shaheen Afridi.Just two singles from the last four balls and he beats the drive of Shubman Gill with a good ball, angled across the right-hander.

And they're off!Abhishek Sharma skips down to the first ball, turns it into a full toss and thumps it down the ground for four.It's gets better - the second ball is lofted high over wide long-off on the drive. Six!

Here we go then, the players are back out for the start of the India chase.Pakistan need a good start with just 127 on the board, Shaheen Afridi will try to provide it.Abhishek Sharma and Shubman Gill will open the batting for India.

Hardik Pandya - 1-34 from three overs
Jasprit Bumrah - 2-28 from four overs
Varun Chakravarthy - 1-24 from four overs
Kuldeep Yadav - 3-18 from four overs

Image source, Getty ImagesThat's it from Brendon McCullum, we're turning our attention to India versus Pakistan and will bring you over-by-over updates of the chase once it begins.Strong finish for Pakistan, largely thanks to four towering sixes from Shaheen Afridi - who finished unbeaten on 33 from 16 balls - has taken them up to 127-9 from their 20 overs.India will still be strong favourites to knock off the runs but Pakistan have given themselves a glimmer of hope...

England coach Brendon McCullum on Test Match Special: "If we look at where we were when we took over, the reason I was employed was to reinvigorate some umph into the set up and utilise the skills that we have in England and our sides under pressure with what we've got."Occasionally weâve got it wrong. That's life, you never know when that point is. We never talk about scoring fast. We talk about absorbing pressure and transferring it, identifying the moments you can transfer it and being courageous enough to do it."Itâs slightly construed that we just swing from the hip and play a bit of golf and have a few beers There's so many people in English cricket that work hard to create a great environment for these guys to work in."There's a squad of players who have been in this squad for a long time."That slight adjustment of throttling down an powering up is quite powerful, youâre not going to be on the hammer the whole time, thereâs going to be times where the opposition are good and are going to put you under the pump and you're going to have to work out if hanging in there the right option or is transferring the right option."If you put them under pressure their margin for error becomes a lot less. Thatâs the mindset that we're about, ripping up that fascination about technique and just starting to get these guys to be totally present and get them to be brave enough to put pressure on the opposition."

Image source, Getty ImagesEngland coach Brendon McCullum on Test Match Special: "I think ultimately, everyone wants this England side to be successful."Thereâs just different styles that youâll operate with that some people will like, some people won't like. You can't worry about that,
you canât change your game because of what people think."You have to have a belief in what you want and use the resources around you to keep performing. We live and die by our results but being hung up on that isn't helpful when youâre at the crease. It's removing that from the picture and thinking about what you're doing. How am I going to manipulate this situation and bring my team success. That's what we try to do."Weâre as determined and as competitive as everyone else, we want success for our team. We take it as a given that we're competitive, we take it as a given that we want to win. We focus on the process as what we're trying to achieve and get these guys to make decisions to give us the greatest chance to succeed."Iâm married to an Australian so I know how competitive they are. Itâs time to get it on when it comes to the Ashes. Weâve been very deliberate that when it comes to Test cricket, weâve focused on the job at hand."For us now, the next series is the Ashes. Bring it on, it's going to be great, the hype, the intensity. Our boys are ready to embrace and enjoy what comes with it. That includes the pressure and the scrutiny."

England coach Brendon McCullum on Test Match Special: "Ben Stokes is progressing well, so is Mark Wood. Those guys are huge for us. Ben Stokes, that India series was the best he's played since Iâve been with him. He bowled faster than weâve ever since, he bowled some great unbelievable wicket taking balls, he was under control, his batting was immense."I think he could have a booming series in Australia, itâs
the best I've seen him, I know how much
he wants this Ashes. My job will be to finesse him through. Sometimes we want stuff too much, our haste to succeed can be the thing that stops us succeeding."There's also some brilliant players in the group, he doesn't have to do it all himself. Mark Wood as well, heâs been getting on well and we think
heâll be chewy for that as well."If we have to take a wider squad that's fine we've saved a whole lot of money from having smaller squads. That's not the objective, the objective is you get that easier activity amongst the group and amongst the support staff."We may well introduce some people but we should be good to go. Sometimes you make plans and they fall short of where you want them but we've made this plan over the past couple of years and we're almost spot on with where we want to be."The outcome will be how we handle it all when weâre out there"

Shaheen Shah Afridi has just clubbed a huge six... but that's about all Pakistan fans have had to cheer about in the past 40 minutes or so.Left-arm wrist-spinner Kuldeep Yadav has worked his magic for India, taking three wickets, as Pakistan have slumped to 90-7 after 17 overs, having been 45-2 in the eight.Sahibzada Farhan had been trying to hold things together but the opener was latest to be dismissed, falling to Kuldeep for 40 from 44 balls.India well on top, then.

England captain Harry Brook: "It was an amazing game the other night so it's a shame the weather has ruined it again."We only played one T20 game [in the series], which is a shame again, but the way we played the other night was phenomenal."So for us to be able to do that against a very strong South Africa side gives us a lot of confidence going forward."On hitting 300 and Salt's innings: "I completely believe in him to go out and perform like that, alongside Jos."I don't think it'll be the last time we get 300 with the batting line-up and talent we've got, we could do that three or four times."On white-ball team: "It's been good fun, first summer as captain so it's been different but we've got a really good group."We've had a really good summer and enjoyed."On what's next: "I've got about a month off before going to New Zealand then the Ashes."
