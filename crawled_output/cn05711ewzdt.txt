I hope the England management do learn from previous mistakes, where when he first came onto the scene.I remember in New Zealand he was asked to bowl right or nine overs of bouncers on a pitch that wasn't get above ankle height.That's just foolish.It's great to see him back. He bowled fast and got his old mojo back. He's got good skills as a bowler and knowing someone has that pace, as a bowler you're naturally on the back foot.He's backing up games but you have to get the management side spot on. Having someone who has that x-factor in the Ashes is going to be crucial.

Very, very impressive stuff from Jofra Archer this summer. It's been really impressive the way he's handled himself, the expectation that he's put on himself. It can become really frustrating, all those long, hard hours of rehab, then finally getting the opportunity the go out there and then things don't click straight away. I haven't seen that at all from him, he's just taken the opportunity and smashed it. He's such a
natural bowler, his pace didn't change throughout that Test series.It's been so heartening to see him back in an England shirt across all formats. If I wanted to wrap cotton wool and bubble wrap around anyone, I'd put it around him, especially when you look at what we've got coming up.

I'm not entirely sure how the team has decided on the order of these players but we've gone from Ollie Pope to Jofra Archer.England's most exciting bowler finally made his return to Test cricket this summer and took nine wickets in his two Tests.He's also impressed in this ongoing white-ball series with 4-18 in the thrashing of South Africa in the third ODI at Southampton and 3-25 in the second T20 at Old Trafford.

Ollie Pope's summer has been exactly how we thought it would've been. I don't know if it was a simple of
a decision as Ollie Pope put up runs against Zimbabwe so we'll put him in, but I'd really like to think that England's selection didn't come from the fact that their number three got runs against a side like that.It was a bizarre situation when Ben Stokes said that Jacob Bethell comes back in, you put two and two together, that was his words, it was a very strange situation. We learnt nothing more about Ollie Pope than we didn't already know. We can say the same about Jacob Bethell this summer, we learnt nothing more about him but we know he is a young talent with a lot of potential. We just haven't see him play enough cricket yet.

The needle hasn't moved very much for Ollie Pope this summer. The hundred against India was a great knock but after that he struggled.I've always felt watching him bat that there are issues with his set up and a good bowler, if they're patient can expose him.He needs to relax a bit more and he has an issue playing straight as well. He tends to fall over quite a lot and gets bowled a lot for a top-order batter.I'd give him a B-.

The Test Match Special team are reviewing England's summer, which was obviously dominated by the five-Test series against India but it has also been an intriguing period for the white-ball side with the thrashing of West Indies and this indifferent series against South Africa.Daniel Norcross, Steven Finn, Stephan Shemilt and Michael Carberry are grading England's players on their performances. We'll bring you some snippets of their thoughts but you can also listen at the top of this page and on BBC Sounds.

England's international "summer" doesn't end here, of course, as they travel to Ireland for a T20 series which starts on Wednesday.There has been a change to that squad as it has been confirmed that Saqib Mahmood will undergo knee surgery which also rules him out of the white-ball tour of New Zealand in October.Hampshire seamer Scott Currie has been called up as his replacement for the Ireland series, having previously represented Scotland in three ODIs.Read more here.

In case you missed it, yesterday saw Somerset beat Hampshire Hawks in a thrilling T20 Blast final. Will Smeed's 94 set up Somerset's chase of 195 to win, before Sean Dickson's 33 and an ice-cold cameo of 18 from five balls from Lewis Gregory got them over the line.

What we saw in Manchester was the perfect performance from this T20 team, it bodes well for the future.

A reminder that we need five overs a side to constitute a game, as with Cardiff during the week. I suspect South Africa's will be quite relieved if that happens considering the demolition they received on Friday.

I mentioned England's record-breaking performance at Old Trafford on Friday and it really was spectacular. Phil Salt led the way with England's fastest century, Jos Buttler made 83 from 30 and they became the first full-member team to score 300 in a T20.

The first match of this series was a chaotic rain-reduced contest in Cardiff, and I can confirm that it hasn't stopped raining here since. Things aren't looking much better in Nottingham today, but let's see how things go after the toss.
