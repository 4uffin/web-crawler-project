Image source, Getty ImagesThe Women's World Cup is also taking place soon, with the first match taking place on 30 September between co-hosts India and Sri Lanka in Guwahati.Australia are the favourites, as usual, followed by India and they are playing three ODIs against one another as the perfect preparation. It is the defending champions who have sent a pretty strong message, however, in the opener.They are cruising to their target of 282, with Beth Mooney leading the charge after Phoebe Litchfield made 88 at the top of the order. You can find that scorecard here.

Er, I haven't got any of the team's analysis to bring you but Joe Root and Ben Stokes both get A*s.I think that's fair. Brendon McCullum has now joined the team for a chat. Again, we'll bring you some snippets from him but you can listen at the top of this page or on BBC Sounds.

It looks like an A for Harry Brook.Joe Root is up next and I don't think there will be much of a debate on this one.

I would give Harry Brook an A.

What we have learned about Harry Brook is that he was the right decision to make him the white-ball captain. I like the way he's taken on the role, I like the way he carries himself, he's very funky and he's really grown into the role. What I think we've also learned is that he is the future Test captain.

Again I'm not entirely sure what the final decision was there. Somewhere between an A and a B, I assume. Make of that what you will.Harry Brook is up next and then we should be hearing from Brendon McCullum.

A B?! I would give him an A.

I want to give Jamie Smith a B.

Image source, Getty ImagesNottingham is not the only place where international cricket is/isn't being played today. India's women are playing the first ODI against Australia while in Dubai India's men are playing Pakistan at the Asia Cup.This India-Pakistan contest is the first since the conflict between the two countries earlier this year. Pakistan have won the toss and chose to bat. The match began at 15:30 BST and you can find a scorecard here.

Jamie Smith averaged 62 with the bat against India. I think he will be a huge talking point in the Ashes. That battle between him and Carey will be very interesting.It will be interesting to see if they keep him in for all five matches though. The last game of that India series,
he looked absolutely shattered. His feet were barely moving and he was throwing himself about. If he plays in all five, it will be a similar story. But, if we look at how the Australian wickets have been playing recently, I don't think that we'll see many five day Tests.

Shoaib Bashir also gets a B-.I'm sure he'll be delighted. We're moving on to Jamie Smith next but I will just update you quickly on the actual game of cricket that we are waiting for - it is still raining.

With Shoaib Bashir, I'd be asking who is the next best option if you don't take him to the Ashes?Bashir was a project. He was picked because Ben Stokes liked what he saw, they liked his height.They need to make sure they are secure in who they pick. If Bashir is your project then he has to play in the Ashes.

Ricky Ponting said that he would 100% play Shoaib Bashir in the Ashes. Going into the Ashes, he probably is the person in line to be that spinner for England.In the India series, he took 10 wickets at 54.

Shoaib Bashir is the classic case of time out is the best way to get better.One thing England love about him is his temperament. After that series against Zimbabwe he said that he's tried to tweak certain things about his action. In the India series, he didn't look great, he didn't look aggressive enough. The only time something happened is when India tried to go after him.I think they'll be some serious consideration of leaving him out in the first game of the Ashes.I'm sticking with B- for Bashir.

I don't want to confuse the TMS team by telling them that GCSEs are graded by 1-9 these days. To any teachers reading, I apologise. Anyway, on to Shoaib Bashir!

While the criticisms are entirely valid, perhaps what England see is that the opening partnership between Crawley and Duckett is the most effective since Cook and Strauss.And Crawley is part of that.I would give the partnership B+, Crawley a B- and Duckett an A-.

Zak Crawley and Ben Duckett are the fifth most prolific opening pair of all time for England, they average 46.5. They come as a pair, you have to look at them together.

Your job is to score runs. You can't tell me that you're happy getting one score in a series.The frustration with me watching Zak Crawley is that he doesn't seem to be the player who gets better after more games.He's played the same Test 59 times. You'd like to see him and think he's starting to work out a method but there doesn't seem to be any improvement.We know what he can do when the planets align, he can be a very destructive batter. But looking forward to the Ashes, a series can be won or lost based on the respective top three.
