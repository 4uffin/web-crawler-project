My project structure is like this:
20240720
# project root
├── tests
├── vnpy
# submodule
├── vnpy_clickhouse
# submodule
├── vnpy_datafeed
# submodule
└── vnpy_factor
# submodule
commit page
After cloning this project, locally recognized projects/git modules/dirs are shown below. Looks like they all have their own branches
my question
The PyCharm project and submodule structures displayed when committing are quite confusing. Does anybody know which check box on commit page I should click?
Why does a new cloned project (pic 2) show url like branches? What are they, and how can they be distinguished from normal ones? Furthermore, how to delete those useless displayed branches?
