For those unfamiliar, ProPlot was widely loved for enabling publication-quality graphics with minimal effort. UltraPlot continues that mission with active development, updated compatibility, and a focus on simplicity.Why UltraPlot?Key improvements over vanilla matplotlib:
- Effortless subplot management: build complex multi-panel layouts in one line
- GeoAxes support included out of the box
- Smarter aesthetics: beautiful colormaps, fonts, and styles without extra code
- Intuitive syntax: less boilerplate, more plotting
- Seamless compatibility: everything you know from matplotlib still applies
Instead of wrestling with subplot positioning and styling, you can write:```
import ultraplot as upltlayout = [[0, 1, 2], [3, 3, 4]]fig, axs = uplt.subplots(layout)axs[0].plot(x, y1, label="Data 1")axs[1].plot(x, y2, label="Data 2")axs.format(xlabel="Hello",
ylabel="Hacker news",
abc="[A]")
# format applies to all axes
fig.legend()```...and get a clean, professional-looking plot in seconds.Get Started:- GitHub: https://github.com/Ultraplot/ultraplot- Docs: https://ultraplot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Try it out and let us know what you think — contributions and feedback are very welcome!replyzahlman 39 minutes ago

> Instead of wrestling with subplot positioning and styling, you can write:This would be more convincing if you showed the equivalent Matplotlib code and demonstrated that any improvements are not just a result of default settings being a closer match for what the example tries to do. The code shown here looks more or less like what I'd expect a Matplotlib hello-world to look like.reply
