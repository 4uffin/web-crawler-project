Can I pass a pointer to a consteval function as an NTTP in C++?

Is it legal to pass a pointer to a consteval function as an NTTP? Assuming that the pointer doesn't escape to runtime.
Given the following code, GCC trunk compiles it but Clang trunk rejects it:
#include <iostream>
consteval int f()
{
return 15;
}
template<auto V>
consteval int g()
{
return V();
}
int main()
{
constexpr int i = g<f>();
std::cout << i << std::endl;
}

Not only GCC, but MSVC as well permit g<f>() inside an immediate invocation: gcc.godbolt.org/z/aPxEqWGns

No, you cannot. A constant template parameter (formerly known as non-type template parameter) must be a constant expression. [expr.const]/22.2.3 states that a prvalue constant expression cannot have a constituent value that is a pointer to an immediate function. For a prvalue of pointer type, the sole constituent value is the pointer value itself (see [expr.const]/2)

Thanks for the to-the-point answer and citations! I've only recently been able to start using C++20 (and later) at work, so I'm still figuring out all the minutiae.
