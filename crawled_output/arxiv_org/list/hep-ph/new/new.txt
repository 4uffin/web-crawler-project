Title:
Long-lived axion-like particles from electromagnetic cascades

We study axion-like particles (ALPs) in beam dump experiments, focusing on the Search for Hidden Particles (SHiP, at CERN) experiment and the Beam Dump eXperiment (BDX, at JLab). Many existing projections for sensitivity to ALPs in beam dump experiments have focused on production from either the primary proton/electron beam, or - in the case of SHiP - the secondary (high-energy) photons produced by neutral meson decays (e.g., $\pi^0\rightarrow\gamma \gamma$). In this work, we study the subsequent production of axions from the full electromagnetic shower in the target, finding order-of-magnitude enhancements in the visible decay yields across a wide range of axion masses. We update SHiP's sensitivity curve and provide new projections for BDX. Both experiments will be able to reach currently unexplored regions of ALP parameter space.

We propose the Semiconductor-Quantum-Well Axion Radiometer Experiment ($\texttt{SQWARE}$) -- a new experimental platform for direct detection of axion dark matter in the meV mass range -- based on resonantly enhanced axion-photon conversion through the inverse Primakoff effect in engineered quantum semiconductor heterostructures. The core of the radiometer is a GaAs/AlGaAs multiple quantum well structure forming a magnetoplasmonic cavity, containing an ultrahigh-mobility two-dimensional electron gas, which realizes a tunable epsilon-near-zero resonance in the terahertz frequency range. By controlling the orientation of the cavity within a strong external magnetic field, both the resonance frequency and the axion-induced current are optimized $\textit{in situ}$, enabling efficient scanning across a broad mass range without complex mechanical adjustment. The axion-induced electromagnetic signal radiatively emitted from the magnetoplasmonic cavity is detected by a state-of-the-art photodetector. We present the theoretical basis for resonant enhancement, detail the experimental design and benchmarks through extensive simulations, and project the sensitivity of $\texttt{SQWARE}$ for several realistic configurations. Our results demonstrate that $\texttt{SQWARE}$ can probe the well-motivated quantum chromodynamics axion parameter space and close a critical gap in direct searches at meV masses.

High-Quality Axion Dark Matter at Gravitational Wave Interferometers

Gravitational effects are known to violate global symmetries, threatening the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) solution to the strong CP problem. Ultraviolet completions featuring a gauged $U(1)$ symmetry, where $U(1)_{\rm PQ}$ arises as an accidental global symmetry, can suppress Planck-suppressed operators, enabling high-quality axions in a mass window where it can also account for the observed dark matter (DM) in the Universe. We show that in such models, the spontaneous breaking of the $U(1)$ gauge symmetry generates a strong stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) from gauge cosmic string loops. For breaking scales $\gtrsim 10^{14}$ GeV, the SGWB signal strength exceeds astrophysical foregrounds across a broad frequency range. Contrary to conventional gauge cosmic string scenarios, such quality axion models have a characteristic IR break frequency originating from the collapse of string-wall network around axion oscillation temperature. We propose this characteristic SGWB frequency-amplitude region, identified as \textit{Signature-Window-Axion-Gravitational waves} (SWAG), to be a novel probe of high-quality axion DM at future space and ground-based interferometers.

Lepton Collider as a Window to Reheating via Freezing Out Dark Matter Detection

We investigate a particle dark matter (DM) scenario where the DM interaction with the Standard Model are mediated by a leptophilic effective operator. Unlike conventional WIMP scenarios where thermal freeze-out occurs in a radiation-dominated Universe, we consider DM freeze-out during a prolonged reheating epoch driven by inflaton decay. The resulting departure from standard cosmology alters the thermal evolution of the dark matter abundance, making it sensitive to the reheating temperature and the history of entropy injection. The leptophilic nature of the interaction, motivated by the absence of DM signals in the current LHC searches, suppresses couplings to quarks and gluons and instead enables viable DM-lepton interactions that remain largely unconstrained. Within this setup, we analyze the mono-Higgs plus missing energy channel at future lepton colliders where the same operator responsible for setting the relic abundance can be directly probed. We perform a detailed signal-background analysis using both polarized and unpolarized beams. Additionally, our results illustrate how collider experiments, when interpreted jointly with relic density constraints, can provide indirect hints of the Universe's thermal history, offering potential insights into the reheating temperature and the dynamics preceding Big Bang Nucleosynthesis.

Discovery Prospects for the $Y=0$ Scalar Triplet at Future $e^+e^-$ Colliders

High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)
The Real Higgs Triplet model, known as the $\Delta$SM, is a minimal extension of the Standard Model (SM) obtained by adding a hypercharge 0 triplet ($\Delta$). This simple model is motivated by the multi-lepton anomalies and excesses in di-photon, $Z\gamma$, and $WW$ spectra at $\approx152\,\text{GeV}$. The model contains, in addition to the SM particle content, a $CP$-even neutral Higgs ($\Delta^0$) and a charged state ($\Delta^\pm$), which are quasi-degenerate in mass. Observing the charged scalar at the LHC and measuring its mass is very challenging, since it dominantly decays to $WZ$, $tb$, and $\tau\nu$. In this article, we consider the discovery prospects at future electron-positron colliders. Taking into account $e^+e^- \to \gamma^*,Z^* \to \Delta^\pm \Delta^\mp$ as the production mechanism and the dominant decay modes, we define three signal regions (SR) to study the charged Higgs properties: SR1: $\ge 3j + 1\ell$, SR2: $\ge 3\ell + \tau_{\text{had}}$, SR3: $\ge 4j + \tau_{\text{had}}$. For $m_{\Delta^\pm}\approx150\,\text{GeV}$, a $5\sigma$ significance can be achieved in SR1 with an integrated luminosity of less than $1\text{ fb}^{-1}$. SR2 is very clean with leptonic final states having low background and small systematic uncertainties. Furthermore, SR3 is crucial for reconstructing the charged scalar invariant mass, which can be measured with $\mathcal{O}(1)\,\text{GeV}$ accuracy with an integrated luminosity of $500\text{ fb}^{-1}$.

Linear seesaw leptogenesis before/after electroweak symmetry breaking
Yan Shao, Zhen-hua Zhao

Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)
The linear seesaw (LSS) model provides a natural framework for generating small neutrino masses at low energy scales, thereby offering promising testability prospects. However, in generic LSS models, the exact mass degeneracy (before the electroweak symmetry breaking) between the two sterile neutrinos that form a Dirac pair precludes the generation of CP asymmetries from their interplay, posing a significant challenge to explaining the observed baryon (or lepton) asymmetry of the Universe via the leptogenesis mechanism. In this work, we explore two well-motivated approaches to generate a suitable mass splitting for the two sterile neutrinos that form a Dirac pair, and consequently naturally realize a resonantly enhanced generation of baryon (and lepton) asymmetry. First, we demonstrate that the renormalization group evolution effects can naturally induce the desired mass splitting for the sterile neutrinos, resulting in a successful generation of the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe. Second, motivated by the recent result from the EMPRESS collaboration that indicates the possible existence of a large lepton asymmetry of the Universe, we explore the possibility that a large lepton asymmetry might naturally follow from the electroweak symmetry breaking which automatically induces the desired mass splitting for the sterile neutrinos.

Relativistic Atomic Effects of Dark Matter Electron Scattering

Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)
The dark matter scattering with atomic bound electrons is a crucial avenue for exploring the sub-GeV mass range. If not handled properly, even negative values can arise in the scattering matrix element squared or equivalently the differential cross section in extreme cases. Starting from quantum field theory, we establish a theoretically consistent formalism to account for the atomic effects. Especially, we investigate the difference between the non-relativistic and relativistic calculations to show that the relativistic effects can lead to a $30\% \sim 50\%$ reduction in the atomic factor. In other words, not just a theoretically consistent formalism for the atomic effects but also relativistic calculation with Dirac equation are necessary.

Extrapolating Exclusive Charmonium Photoproduction to the Forward Regime Using Gaussian Process

Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)
Accessing the forward kinematic regime of exclusive vector meson photoproduction is essential for probing the structure of the proton, yet this region is often experimentally inaccessible. We present a novel extrapolation of near-threshold $\gamma p \to J/\psi p$ differential cross section data to the forward regime $d\sigma/dt|_{t=0}$ by applying a non-parametric Gaussian Process (GP) regression. By employing a two-dimensional GP dependent on both the squared momentum transfer $t$ and the center-of-mass energy $W$, we perform a coherent analysis of world data and provide a robust quantification of the extrapolation uncertainties. Furthermore, we apply the GP in the determination of the proton mass radius from the $J/\psi$ photoproduction data. We find that the extracted radius is subject to large systematic uncertainties, highlighting the challenge in precisely constraining this quantity with current experimental precision. This work demonstrates that GP is a powerful and systematic tool for phenomenological studies in hadron physics, particularly for extrapolations into unmeasured kinematic domains.

Signature of axion dark matter in low-frequency terrestrial electromagnetic fields: formulation and predictions

Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO)
We develop a theoretical framework for axion dark matter (DM) searches using terrestrial electromagnetic (EM) fields. Axions couple to the geomagnetic field and generate a monochromatic EM signal at a frequency set by the axion mass. Incorporating a realistic atmospheric conductivity, we describe the axion-induced EM waves confined in the Earth-ionosphere cavity, avoiding the divergences present in idealized treatments. Our semi-analytical method yields quantitative predictions for the axion-induced magnetic field near the Earth's surface, and we found that (i) at $m_{\rm a} \gtrsim 10^{-14}$ eV, the signal exhibits resonance structures aligned with Schumann resonances, and the magnetic field amplitude is especially enhanced at $m_{\rm a} \sim 3 \times 10^{-14}$ eV. (ii) The signal amplitude and orientation also vary with geographic location, with Southeast Asia offering the strongest sensitivity. These predictions are insensitive to uncertainties in conductivity models and boundary conditions. Those distinctive features provide a reliable template to distinguish axion-induced signals from natural or anthropogenic EM backgrounds, and the formalism can be extended to other DM candidates such as dark photons.

Unified Spectroscopic Study of Bottom Mesons and Doubly Bottom Baryons Using a Relativistic Flux-Tube Model

High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)
Using the relativistic flux tube (RFT) model with spin-dependent corrections, we present a unified investigation of the mass spectra for singly bottom mesons ($B$, $B_s$) and doubly bottom baryons ($\Xi_{bb}$, $\Omega_{bb}$). Within this framework, the calculated masses for established $B$ and $B_s$ meson states show excellent agreement with experimental data. Leveraging these reliable predictions for low-lying states, we propose spectroscopic assignments for several higher excitations: we identify the $B_J^*(5732)$ resonance as an excellent candidate for the $1P(1^+)$ state; further, we assign the $B_J(5840)$ resonance as the first radial excitation ($2S$), and the $B_J(5970)$ resonance as a $1D$-wave orbital excitation. In the bottom-strange sector, we predict that the recently observed $B_{sJ}(6063)$ and $B_{sJ}(6114)$ resonances belong to the $1D$-wave multiplet. Extending our model to doubly bottom baryons, we present comprehensive predictions for the spectra of the $\Xi_{bb}$ and $\Omega_{bb}$ baryons, identifying their ground and excited states. These theoretical insights serve as valuable benchmarks, offering guidance for future experimental searches targeting yet-to-be-discovered bottom mesons and doubly bottom baryons.

Title:
Enhancement of Weak Interactions in Phase Transitions

Weak interactions cause small parity-violating energy differences between left- and right-handed chiral systems. Although normally tiny, these effects may be significantly enhanced during collective phenomena such as phase transitions. We propose a theoretical model describing the enhancement of weak interactions in phase transitions. The enhancement factor is proportional to the critical number of atoms, $N_c$, in the nucleus of the new phase. After the nucleus reaches its critical size, it grows until it fills the entire system. Measurement of the ratio of produced left and right chiral structures may provide a way to measure this critical number $N_c$. Experiments where definite spin-chiral structures are formed during a phase transition in crossed electric and magnetic fields, indicate $N_c \sim 10^9 - 10^{10}$. An open question is whether a similar enhancement could operate during cosmological phase transitions - thereby boosting CP-violating effects sufficiently to contribute to the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry (baryogenesis).

Exploring CP violation and vanishing electric dipole moment of the electron in a scale-invariant general 2HDM

Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)
We investigate a scale-invariant general two-Higgs-doublet model with explicit CP violation. Using the Gildener-Weinberg method, we analyze the Higgs mass spectrum and couplings at the one-loop level, focusing on CP violation originating from both the Higgs potential and the Yukawa sector. We show that, due to the flatness condition, both CP-even and CP-odd mixings between the 125 GeV Higgs boson and the heavier Higgs states arise only radiatively. As a result, the Higgs couplings to gauge bosons and fermions remain Standard Model-like, in agreement with current LHC constraints. We also find that the magnitude of CP violation from the Higgs potential depends on the new complex Yukawa couplings and heavy Higgs masses, due to the flatness condition. In the case where only an additional top Yukawa coupling $\rho_{tt}$ is present, the electron electric dipole moment is directly proportional to $\mathrm{Im}\rho_{tt}^2$. Furthermore, a nontrivial cancellation region can occur for a specific Higgs mass spectrum. We extend our analysis to scenarios with an additional complex electron Yukawa coupling, identifying the conditions under which the electron electric dipole moment is suppressed or vanishes.

Monojet and direct detection constraints on real scalar dark matter: EFT and a simple UV completion

High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)
We consider constraints that can be placed on certain invisible scalar particles through monojet studies at the LHC and compare them with those from direct detection experiments when interpreted as dark matter. Whereas direct detection constraints are typically more restrictive, we identify regions of parameter space where monojet studies provide important complementary bounds. We carry out our analysis using both a $\phi$SMEFT for real scalar particle pairs coupled to standard-model fields through operators of up to dimension six, and a simple UV completion with vector-like quarks, with both the scalars and the vector-like quarks being odd under a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, while the SM particles are even. The vector-like quarks can only decay into a jet and an invisible scalar, and we recast the current ATLAS monojet data to constrain their parameter space. Comparison of the two descriptions yields some insight into interpreting dark matter constraints obtained with EFTs.

Fine-grained dark matter substructure and axion haloscopes

The velocity distribution of cold dark matter within galaxies is expected to exhibit ultra-fine-grained substructure as a result of the many foldings of an initially smooth phase-space sheet under gravity. The innumerable folds of this sheet in the inner regions of a galactic halo would appear on solar-system scales like an extremely large number of spatially overlapping streams of dark matter particles. Some of these streams may also receive amplified densities if dark matter undergoes enhanced clustering in the early Universe, as is the case for axions in the post-inflationary scenario. This ultra-fine-grained dark matter substructure is usually considered irrelevant and undetectable for most direct detection experiments, but for axion haloscopes, this may not be the case. We develop and explore several plausible models for the degree of fine-grained axion dark matter substructure so as to evaluate its impact on the detectability of axions. We find that not only is this substructure detectable in haloscope experiments, but that it may enhance the detectability of the axion if data is analysed with a high-enough frequency resolution. This conclusion motivates ongoing high-resolution analyses of axion data by haloscope collaborations, which have the potential to reveal evidence of the QCD axion even if their nominal experimental sensitivity does not reach the required level under the Standard Halo Model assumption.

We propose a novel method to probe gluon linear polarization via energy correlations in hard scattering processes. This approach exploits the characteristic $\cos 2\phi$ azimuthal modulation in single- and two-point energy correlations within jets initiated by polarized gluons. In contrast to conventional techniques that rely on $k_t$ resummation or intricate jet substructure observables, our method offers a theoretically robust and experimentally accessible avenue for gluon polarimetry. We perform an all-order analysis within the Ciafaloni-Catani-Fiorani-Marchesini (CCFM) formalism, incorporating coherent branching effects to achieve improved precision. Our predictions can be tested at current and future facilities, including the LHC, RHIC, HERA, and the EIC.

Dark photons, which can kinetically mix with ordinary photons, represent the simplest extension to the standard model. Detecting their oscillations with visible photons could provide crucial insights into the nature of dark matter and fundamental interactions beyond the standard model. We propose a novel laboratory-based approach to detect dark photon oscillations using a laser in an Optical Time-domain Relectometry (OTDR) setup. The laser light propagating through the optical fiber undergoes oscillations with the dark photon, leading to measurable changes in the power flow. These oscillations can precisely measured,
leveraging its high sensitivity and efficiency in detecting small variations in the optical signal. This approach could provide a new avenue for probing dark photon oscillations in the laboratory and greatly improve the current experimental sensitivity to dark photon in a wide mass range.

Machine learning techniques have emerged as powerful tools for tackling non-perturbative challenges in quantum chromodynamics. In this study, we introduce a data-driven framework employing deep neural networks to systematically predict the temperature-dependent behavior of the screening mass $m_D(T)$ and the strong coupling constant $\alpha_s(T)$ within a quark-gluon plasma medium. These medium-sensitive quantities are subsequently employed to compute the thermal widths $\Gamma_{\text{n}}(T)$ and binding energies $E_B(T)$ of heavy quarkonia states, specifically charmonia and bottomonia, by numerically solving the Schrödinger equation with medium-modified heavy quark potentials. To estimate the dissociation temperatures $T_d$ of various quarkonia states, we employ two complementary dissociation criteria: the conventional one, where $2E_B(T_d) = \Gamma_{\text{n}}(T_d)$, and an additional lower bound criterion defined by $E_B(T) = 3T$. This dual-criterion approach provides a more constrained and physically motivated estimate of the temperature range over which quarkonia states dissolve in the QGP environment. Our machine learning-enhanced predictions show excellent agreement with available lattice QCD results, especially for the ground states $\Upsilon(1S)$ and $J/\psi$, and offer new perspectives on the sequential suppression pattern detected in relativistic heavy-ion collision experiments. Overall, this work advances the quantitative description of quarkonium suppression and demonstrates the prospect of modern machine learning methods to bridge theoretical predictions and experimental observations, thereby contributing significantly to QGP tomography.

High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)
Hyperon-antihyperon pairs produced in high-energy electron-positron annihilation are promising systems for the study of quantum information properties. In this work, we make an analysis of two types of quantum correlations, the quantum steering and discord, in hyperon-antihyperon systems produced in electron-positron annihilation based on the $X$-shaped spin density matrix. The behaviors of these quantum correlations differ from those in elementary particle-antiparticle systems such as the top quark and tau lepton due to the polarization effect. The hierarchy of quantum correlations is examined and partially confirmed in hyperon-antihyperon systems: $ \textrm{Bell Nonlocality} \subset \textrm{Steering} \subset \textrm{Entanglement} \subset \text{Discord}$. The loopholes and quantum decoherence effect are also discussed in our work.

The multiplicity distributions measured in proton proton collisions at the LHC exhibit interesting new features. One of them is the appearance of substructures, such as the so-called "shoulder" at large multiplicities. The most natural interpretation of this behavior is the existence of two production mechanisms. The final result is then a superposition of two distributions. In a previous publication we assumed that the two production mechanisms are soft and semihard partonics scatterings. In this work we further discuss this assumption and, in particular, we study the dependence of the results on the scale which separates soft from hard events.

We investigate a WIMP dark matter (DM) candidate in the form of a singlino-dominated lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) within the $Z_3$-symmetric Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. This framework gives rise to regions of parameter space where DM is obtained via co-annihilation with nearby higgsino-like electroweakinos and DM direct detection~signals are suppressed, the so-called ``blind spots". On the other hand, collider signatures remain promising due to enhanced radiative decay modes of higgsinos into the singlino-dominated LSP and a photon, rather than into leptons or hadrons. This motivates searches for radiatively decaying neutralinos, however, these signals face substantial background challenges, as the decay products are typically soft due to the small mass-splits ($\Delta m$) between the LSP and the higgsino-like coannihilation partners. We apply a data-driven Machine Learning (ML) analysis that improves sensitivity to these subtle signals, offering a powerful complement to traditional search strategies to discover a new physics scenario. Using an LHC integrated luminosity of $100~\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ at $14~\mathrm{TeV}$, the method achieves a $5\sigma$ discovery reach for higgsino masses up to $225~\mathrm{GeV}$ with $\Delta m\!\lesssim\!12~\mathrm{GeV}$, and a $2\sigma$ exclusion up to $285~\mathrm{GeV}$ with $\Delta m\!\lesssim\!20~\mathrm{GeV}$. These results highlight the power of collider searches to probe DM candidates that remain hidden from current direct detection experiments, and provide a motivation for a search by the LHC collaborations using ML methods.

Hunting the elusive $X17$ in CE$ν$NS at the ESS

High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)
The so-called $X17$ particle has been proposed in order to explain a very significant resonant behaviour (in both the angular separation and invariant mass) of $e^+e^-$ pairs produced during a nuclear transition of excited $^8$Be, $^4$He and $^{12}$C nuclei. Fits to the corresponding data point, as most probable explanation, to a spin-1 object, which is protophobic and has a mass of approximately 16.7 MeV, which then makes the $X17$ potentially observable in Coherent Elastic neutrino ($\nu$) Nucleus Scattering (CE$\nu$NS) at the European Spallation Source (ESS). By adopting as theoretical framework a minimal extension of the Standard Model (SM) with a generic $U(1)'$ gauge group mixing with the hypercharge one of the latter, which can naturally accommodate the $X17$ state compliant with all available measurements from a variety of experiments, we predict that CE$\nu$NS at the ESS will constitute an effective means to probe this hypothesis, even after allowing for the inevitable systematics associated to the performance of the planned detectors therein.

Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)
In the framework of non-holomorphic modular invariance approach, we have systematically constructed all minimal lepton models based on the non-holomorphic $A^{\prime}_{5}$ modular symmetry from a bottom-up approach. In these models, the Yukawa couplings are described by polyharmonic Maaß forms of integer weights at level $N=5$. Under the assumption of Majorana neutrinos, both the Weinberg operator and the type-I seesaw mechanism are considered for neutrino mass generation. All minimal models are found to be based on generalized CP (gCP) symmetry, and each of them depends on five real dimensionless parameters and two overall scales. Through comprehensive numerical scanning, we obtain 6 (4) phenomenologically viable Weinberg operator models and 94 (76) phenomenologically viable seesaw models for normal (inverted) ordering neutrino masses. For each viable model, we present predictions for key neutrino properties, such as lepton masses, CP violation phases, mixing angles, effective Majorana mass for neutrinoless double beta decay and the kinematical mass in beta decay. Furthermore, we provide detailed numerical analysis for two representative models to illustrate our results.

By using a new expansion method, applicable to decoupling hypersurfaces with arbitrary geometry, we reproduce the known term proportional to thermal vorticity and obtain an upgraded form of the spin-shear term which captures the dependence on the geometry. The new method also includes additional contributions whose physical nature is to be assessed. The new expression also naturally excludes contributions from space-time gradients in the normal direction of the hypersurface, providing a theoretical justification for the isothermal condition previously imposed a priori. This framework can be extended to particles with arbitrary spin.

Non-invertible Chiral Symmetry and Axions under Electromagnetic Duality

We study the implications of non-invertible chiral symmetry in a four-dimensional U(1) gauge theory coupled to massless fermions with electromagnetic $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ duality. This is done by deriving the Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly of massless QED in the dual frame that is used to explicitly construct the symmetry defect operator as well as the conserved two-form symmetry current. As expected, the non-invertible chiral symmetry is covariant under the duality transformation. This has implications for understanding the nature of kinetic and topological terms in the dual frame and for axion electrodynamics. In particular, we show that to generate an axion potential from a dyon loop, the one-form magnetic symmetry must be explicitly broken by a mutually non-local charged state with nonzero pairwise helicity.

We investigate the effects of Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) on photon interactions, considering both intergalactic propagation (Breit-Wheeler process) and atmospheric interactions (Bethe-Heitler process). By incorporating LIV into the theoretical framework, we analyze how it modifies key quantities such as the cross section, threshold energy, and mean free path of photons traveling through intergalactic space. In addition, we study its impact on extensive air showers initiated by high-energy photons, demonstrating that LIV can alter the cross section of the primary interaction in the atmosphere. Additionally, we also test the photon interactions in the Earth crust, to evaluate if they can induce upward-going showers. Our results highlight the necessity of accounting for both propagation effects in intergalactic space and interactions in the atmosphere when evaluating LIV signatures. Even small deviations from Lorentz invariance can lead to measurable changes in astroparticle propagation and photon dynamics, offering new opportunities to test quantum gravity theories through high-energy astrophysical observations.

Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) can have multiple consequences on very-high energy gamma rays' emission, propagation, and detection, such as energy-dependent photon group velocity, photon instability, vacuum birefringence, and modified electromagnetic interaction. Depending on the underlying theoretical model, several of these effects can coexist. Nevertheless, in experimental tests of LIV, each effect is tested separately and independently. Here, we are performing a search for traces of several coexisting effects in a single analysis. We present our analysis method based on artificial neural networks and put our very first results in the context of experimental searches for LIV.

Learning Informed Prior Distributions with Normalizing Flows for Bayesian Analysis

Subjects:

We investigate the use of normalizing flow (NF) models as flexible priors in Bayesian inference with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. Trained on posteriors from previous analyses, these models can be used as informative priors, capturing non-trivial distributions and correlations, in subsequent inference tasks. We compare different training strategies and loss functions, finding that training based on Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and unsupervised learning consistently yield the most accurate reproductions of reference distributions. Applied in sequential Bayesian workflows, MCMC with the NF-based priors reproduces the results of one-shot joint inferences well, provided the target distributions are unimodal. In cases with pronounced multi-modality or dataset tension, distortions may arise, underscoring the need for caution in multi-stage Bayesian inference. A comparison between the pocoMC MCMC sampler and the standard emcee sampler further demonstrates the importance of advanced and robust algorithms for exploring the posterior space. Overall, our results establish NF-based priors as a practical and efficient tool for sequential Bayesian inference in high-dimensional parameter spaces.

In this paper we propose a two-field model of warm inflation motivated from a heterotic string construction. The model contains an axion and a dilaton-like field. We show that while warm inflation can take place in the axion-field direction, thermal corrections coming from the radiation gauge fields, which couples to both the axion and the dilaton, prevent warm inflation to happen in the dilaton-field direction. We explore the background dynamics for different parameters, and identify a diversity of dynamical behaviors allowed in this model, denoting different regimes of warm inflation.

Fifth force and equivalence principle tests search for new interactions by precisely measuring forces between macroscopic collections of atoms and molecules and their properties under free fall. In contrast, the early Universe plasma probes these interactions at a more fundamental level. In this paper, we consider the case of a scalar mediating a fifth force, and show that the effects of dimensional transmutation, spontaneous symmetry breaking, and the running of the gauge couplings cause the scalar's low-energy interactions to mix, leading to nearly universal dynamics at early times. We use known expressions for the pressure of the Standard Model during its various epochs to compute the scalar effective potential, and find that the cosmological dynamics of this scalar are very sensitive to the reheat temperature of the Universe. Given the unknown reheat temperature, we show that scalar couplings to matter larger than $\sim 10^{-6}(m_\phi/{\rm eV})^{-1/4}$ relative to gravity produce the correct dark matter abundance, motivating new physics searches in this part of parameter space.

In this Letter, we motivate the fact that couplings between a scalar field and the Standard Model with strengths $10^{-6}(m_\phi/{\rm eV})^{-1/4}$ relative to gravity yield the total measured cosmological dark matter abundance over a broad mass range of $10^{-12}$ to $10^{14}\ \rm{eV}$. Remarkably, this result holds with minimal sensitivity to whether the scalar couples to electrons, photons, hadrons, or other particles at laboratory energy scales, thereby linking fifth force experiments to the search for dark matter.

We analyze all individual cosmic strings of various lengths in a large ensemble of the global cosmic string networks in the post-inflationary scenario, obtained from numerical simulations on a discrete lattice with $N^3 = 4096^3$. A strong evidence for a logarithmically growing spectral index of the string power spectrum during the evolution is newly reported as our main result. The logarithmic scaling is checked against two different approaches for generating initial random field configurations, namely fat-string type and thermal phase transition. We derive the analytic relation between two power spectra of cosmic strings and axions which should be valid under some assumptions, and the validity of those assumptions is discussed. We argue that our analytic result strongly supports the correlated spectra of cosmic strings and axions. Additionally, we initiate the statistical analysis of the causal dynamics of the cosmic strings.

The gauge-singlet right-handed neutrinos would be essential to explain the tiny masses of active neutrinos. We consider the effective field theory of the Standard Model extended with these fields under the assumption that neutrinos are Dirac particles. In this framework, we provide a comprehensive study for the phenomenological consequences of various dimension six interactions employing various high and low energy observables. These include the neutrino mass itself, constraints from electroweak precision test and collider searches for lepton or jet plus missing energy, coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering, beta decays, as well as decays of proton, meson, tau, and top. We also study their astrophysical and cosmological implications for stellar cooling and relativistic degrees of freedom.

The present work is devoted to developing the integrated hydrokinetic model (iHKM) for relativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions. While the previous cycle of works on this topic focused on ultra-relativistic collisions at the top RHIC and different LHC energies, the current work addresses relativistic collisions at the lower energies, specifically ranging from approximately 2 to 50 GeV per nucleon pair in the center-of-mass colliding system. In such collisions, the formation times for the initial state of dense matter can be up to three orders of magnitude longer than those in ultra-relativistic collisions. This difference reflects a fundamentally distinct nature and formation process, particularly regarding the possible stages of initial state evolution, including thermalization (which may be only partial at very low collision energies), subsequent hydrodynamic expansion, and the final transition of matter evolution into a hadronic cascade. These stages, which are fully realized in ultra-relativistic reactions, can also occur within the energy range of BES RHIC, albeit with distinct time scales. This publication not only advances the theoretical development of iHKM (referred to, if necessary, as the {\it{extended}} version of the integrated Hydrokinetic Model, iHKM{\it{e}}), but also provides examples of model applications for calculating observables. A systematic description across a wide range of experimental energies, which is preliminary yet quite satisfactory, for spectra, flow, and femtoscopy, will follow this study.

We present a novel technique to incorporate precision calculations from quantum chromodynamics into fully differential particle-level Monte-Carlo simulations. By minimizing an information-theoretic quantity subject to constraints, our reweighted Monte Carlo incorporates systematic uncertainties absent in individual Monte Carlo predictions, achieving consistency with the theory input in precision and its estimated systematic uncertainties. Our method can be applied to arbitrary observables known from precision calculations, including multiple observables simultaneously. It generates strictly positive weights, thus offering a clear path to statistically powerful and theoretically precise computations for current and future collider experiments. As a proof of concept, we apply our technique to event-shape observables at electron-positron colliders, leveraging existing precision calculations of thrust. Our analysis highlights the importance of logarithmic moments of event shapes, which have not been previously studied in the collider physics literature.

We show that Earth's natural environment can serve as a powerful probe for ultralight axion dark matter. In the presence of global geomagnetic fields, the axions with masses ranging from $10^{-15}\,{\rm eV}-10^{-13}\,{\rm eV}$ induce electromagnetic waves in the (sub-) extremely low-frequency band ($0.3-30\,{\rm Hz}$) through the axion-photon coupling. We predict the amplitude of induced magnetic fields in the Earth-ionosphere cavity, taking the finite conductivity of the atmosphere into account. This allows us to constrain the axion-photon coupling parameter, $g_{\rm a\gamma}$, from the long-term monitoring data of the low-frequency magnetic fields, resulting in a significant improvement from the previous constraints down to $g_{\rm a\gamma} \lesssim 4\times10^{-13}\,{\rm GeV}^{-1}$ for axion mass $\sim 3 \times 10^{-14}\,{\rm eV}$.

We explore the constraints on new physics from the recent NA62 observation of the kaon decay $K^+\to\pi^+$+$\not{\!\!E}$ with missing energy $\not{\!\!E}$ in the context of a dark-matter (DM) scenario recently used to accommodate the Belle II finding of an enhanced rate of the $b$-meson decay $B^+\to K^+$+$\not{\!\!E}$ compared to the standard-model expectation. Specifically, assuming that a light real scalar boson $\phi$ plays the role of DM and working in an effective field-theory framework, we study model independently the impact of operators involving $\phi$ and ordinary quarks on the aforementioned transitions over the kaon mode's kinematical mass region of $m_\phi < (m_K - m_\pi)/2 = 177$ MeV. Such a DM particle is subject to significant restrictions from the observed relic abundance and from DM direct-detection experiments incorporating the Migdal effect, as well as from indirect searches in cosmic microwave background data and collider experiments, except when its mass is between 110 and 146 MeV. We demonstrate that $K^+\to\pi^+\phi\phi$ can saturate the new-physics window in the NA62 result if $m_\phi$ lies in the 110-130 MeV portion of the range left by the DM constraints, thus providing a complementary constraint on this scenario. Improved data from future Belle II and NA62 measurements and DM quests can test it more stringently. In particular, expanding the NA62 signal window into the region that is now removed due to three-body decay background modes could further explore the remaining mass window for this type of invisible particle, $130 < m_\phi < 177$ MeV.

The goal of this work is to provide a pedagogical introduction to dipole moments and dipole transitions in theories beyond the Standard Model, with a focus on the lepton sector. We emphasize the exceptional sensitivity of dipole observables to new physics, analyzing the most sensitive processes, such as the muon anomalous magnetic moment, the electric dipole moment of the electron, and the branching ratio $\text{BR}(\mu \to e \gamma)$. This review is intended for PhD students, early-career researchers, and anyone entering the field for the first time. It does not aim to provide a complete overview of all models in the literature, but rather to serve as an accessible guide, using simple and representative examples from the most well-studied extensions of the Standard Model.

Dark matter (DM) could self-annihilate into neutrinos in dense regions of the Universe. We consider the resulting flux of neutrinos from the Milky Way DM halo and derive exclusion limits on the annihilation cross-section using XENONnT electron recoil data. Assuming a $J$-factor independent of the annihilation cross-section, we find leading limits for DM masses below $\mathcal{O}$(MeV). Self-annihilating DM affects the DM halo via dissolution, introducing a cross-section dependency on the halo profile and thus the $J$-factor. We discuss such a situation in more detail, finding that the signal rate is below the experimental sensitivity of XENONnT, leaving the annihilation cross-section unconstrained.

While gluon fusion dominates Higgs pair production at the LHC, vector boson fusion (VBF) offers a unique window into Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics through its distinctive kinematic features and direct sensitivity to Higgs-vector boson interactions. We perform a comprehensive analysis of double Higgs production via VBF in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), systematically investigating how dimension-6 and dimension-8 bosonic operators - particularly those involving field derivatives - can enhance the production rate. We identify the most relevant Wilson coefficients (WCs) affecting the trilinear Higgs coupling ($hhh$) and Higgs-vector boson interactions ($hVV$, $hhVV$). Using constraints from global fits and interpolating fit results for unconstrained WCs with Naive Dimensional Analysis, we assess their effects on the $VV \to hh$ ($V = W,Z$) scattering amplitudes and cross-sections. Our analysis includes a study of EFT convergence and validity in models with scalar extensions of the SM. Numerical simulations for the planned High-Luminosity LHC experiment (HL-LHC) in general reveal only a modest and challenging to detect enhancement of the VBF di-Higgs production rate over the SM prediction. However, we show that in optimistic scenarios, such a process could be observed at the HL-LHC. In certain cases, when the enhancement is dominated by the dimension-6 or dimension-8 operators containing field derivatives (and thus leading to stronger energy-dependent effects), this channel becomes competitive with di-Higgs production via gluon fusion. This work highlights the role of VBF di-Higgs production as a complementary channel for probing anomalous Higgs couplings and their impact on BSM physics.

The accurate identification of heavy-flavour jets, those which originate from bottom or charm quarks, is crucial for precision studies of the Standard Model and searches for new physics. However, assigning flavour to jets presents significant challenges, primarily due to issues with infrared and collinear (IRC) safety. This paper aims to address these challenges by evaluating recently-proposed jet algorithms designed to be IRC-safe and applicable in high-precision measurements. We compare these algorithms across benchmark heavy-flavour production processes and kinematic regimes that are relevant for LHC phenomenology. Exploiting both fixed-order calculations in QCD as well as parton shower simulations, we analyse the infrared sensitivity of these new algorithms at different stages of the event evolution and compare to flavour-labelling strategies currently adopted by LHC collaborations. The results highlight that, while all algorithms lead to more robust flavour-assignments compared to current techniques, they vary in performance depending on the observable and energy regime. The study lays groundwork for robust, flavour-aware jet analyses in current and future collider experiments to maximise the physics potential of experimental data by reducing discrepancies between theoretical and experimental methods.

The $\Lambda_c(2940)$, an open-charm baryon discovered in 2006, has sparked interest due to its ``low mass puzzle'', paralleling the $X(3872)$ in the charmoniumlike sector. Both states challenge conventional hadronic interpretations, with the $X(3872)$ understood as a $D^*\bar{D}$ molecular state and the $\Lambda_c(2940)$ hypothesized as a $D^*N$ molecular state. This work investigates the radiative decay modes $\Lambda_c(2940) \to \Lambda_c(2286)\gamma$, $\Lambda_c(2940) \to \Lambda_c(2595)\gamma$, and $\Lambda_c(2940) \to \Lambda_c(2765)\gamma$, analogous to radiative transitions observed in the $X(3872)$. Using the one-boson-exchange model to obtain the $D^*N$ molecular spatial wave function as input, we calculate decay widths and their ratios, finding differences with different quantum number assumptions. Our findings underscore the potential of electromagnetic probes in revealing its nature and highlight the need for dedicated experimental studies to validate these theoretical predictions.

A critical challenge in particle physics is combining results from diverse experimental setups that measure the same physical quantity to enhance precision and statistical power, a process known as a global fit. Global fits of sterile neutrino searches, hunts for additional neutrino oscillation frequencies and amplitudes, present an intriguing case study. In such a scenario, the key assumptions underlying Wilks' theorem, a cornerstone of most classic frequentist analyses, do not hold. The method of Feldman and Cousins, a trials-based approach which does not assume Wilks' theorem, becomes computationally prohibitive for complex or intractable likelihoods. To bypass this limitation, we borrow a technique from simulation-based inference (SBI) to estimate likelihood ratios for use in building trials-based confidence intervals, speeding up test statistic evaluations by a factor $>10^4$ per grid point, resulting in a faster, but approximate, frequentist fitting framework. Applied to a subset of sterile neutrino search data involving the disappearance of muon-flavor (anti)neutrinos, our method leverages machine learning to compute frequentist confidence intervals while significantly reducing computational expense. In addition, the SBI-based approach holds additional value by recognizing underlying systematic uncertainties that the Wilks approach does not. Thus, our method allows for more robust machine learning-based analyses critical to performing accurate but computationally feasible global fits. This allows, for the first time, a global fit to sterile neutrino data without assuming Wilks' theorem. While we demonstrate the utility of such a technique studying sterile neutrino searches, it is applicable to both single-experiment and global fits of all kinds.

An Efficient On-shell Framework for EFT Matching

Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)
We develop an on-shell framework for matching ultraviolet (UV) theories to low-energy effective field theories (EFTs) at loop level, based on the unitary cut method. By promoting unitarity double-cuts to $d=4-2\epsilon$ dimensions, the constructible integrands incorporate both branch-cut components and rational terms. The unconstructible parts, such as tadpoles and kinematically independent bubbles, are proved to be unnecessary for EFT matching. In this framework, all requisite loop amplitudes are constructed by sewing a pair of on-shell tree-level amplitudes. Consequently, the method eliminates complications from gauge fixing and ghost fields inherent in traditional loop calculations, while also avoiding supplementary efforts to construct rational terms and implement generalized unitarity cuts for master integral coefficient extraction required in conventional on-shell approaches. This yields a more efficient and systematic methodology. Furthermore, UV amplitudes are systematically matched to a complete set of on-shell amplitude bases via large mass expansion, bypassing concerns about operator redundancies or gauge invariance issues inherent in traditional matching methods. Therefore, this framework can be more easily implemented in programs.

We study QED corrections to operator matrix elements involving heavy composite particles (e.g., heavy-mesons, nuclei, and atoms). We define a new notion of reducible and irreducible graphs which is useful for systems with many discrete excited states. The equivalence of the LSZ reduction formula and old fashioned perturbation theory is explicitly demonstrated. The self energy and vertex corrections are defined (to all orders), and the one-loop corrections are reduced to operator matrix elements which may be evaluated by hadronic, nuclear, or atomic theorists. The gauge dependence of the various pieces are studied in detail at one loop, and cancellation of spurious contributions are demonstrated in a class of covariant gauges; Coulomb gauge is also discussed. The formalism is applied to superallowed beta decay where the one-loop structure is connected to existing literature based on current algebra techniques. We further identify the well known $O(Z^2\alpha^2)$ isospin breaking correction from the intranuclear Coulomb field as arising from two-loop diagrams. We comment on future applications of our results to the radiative corrections necessary in extractions of $|V_{ud}|$, in particular for corrections that required beyond one-loop order.

Renormalization-group equations (RGE)is one of the key tools in studying high-energy behavior of the Standard Model (SM). We begin by reviewing one-loop RGE for the dimensionless couplings of the SM and proceed to the state-of-the-art results. Our study focuses on the RGE solutions at different loop orders. We compare not only the standard ("diagonal") loop counting when one considers gauge, Yukawa, and scalar self-coupling beta functions at the same order but also "non-diagonal" ones, inspired by the so-called Weyl consistency conditions. We discuss the initial conditions for RGE ("matching") for different loop configurations and study the uncertainties of running couplings both related to the limited precision of the experimental input ("parametric") and the missing high-order corrections ("theoretical"). As an application of our analysis we also estimate the electroweak vacuum decay probability and study how the uncertainties in the running parameters affect the latter. We argue that "non-diagonal" beta functions, if coupled with a more consistent "non-diagonal" matching, lead to larger theoretical uncertainty than "diagonal" ones.

Spontaneous symmetry breaking through the Higgs field has been experimentally confirmed as a basic ingredient of the Standard Model. However, the origin of the phenomenon may not be entirely clear, because, in perturbation theory, the vacuum turns out to be a metastable state. An alternative scenario was proposed that implies a second resonance of the Higgs field ${\cal H}$ with a well delimited mass $(M_H)^{\rm Theor} = 690\,(30)$ GeV. This stabilises the potential, but, owing to an $H$ coupling to longitudinal $W$s with the same typical strength as that of the low-mass state with $m_h= 125$ GeV, it would still remain a relatively narrow resonance. Our scope here is twofold. First, leaving out many details, we outline a simple logical path where the, apparently surprising, idea of such a second resonance follows from basic properties of $\Phi^4$ theories. Secondly, we spell out a definite experimental signature of this resonance that is clearly visible in various LHC data. As a by-product, the ${\cal H} ^3$ term gives $\kappa_\lambda = (M_H/m_h) \sim $ 5.5 consistently with the ATLAS and CMS data.

Title:
Field-theoretic versus data-driven evaluations of electromagnetic corrections to hadronic vacuum polarization in $(g-2)_μ$

The Standard Model prediction of the muon $g-2$ increasingly depends on lattice QCD computations of the hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP), where the isospin-breaking (IB) effects remain a significant source of uncertainty. To complement the lattice QCD evaluations, the data-driven approach to HVP has been used to assess some of the electromagnetic IB effects, in particular from the channels with a photon in the final state, e.g., $e^+e^-\to\pi^0 \gamma$. Here we argue that such contributions are largely canceled by virtual electromagnetic corrections to the purely hadronic channels: $\pi^+ \pi^-$, $\pi^+ \pi^- \pi^0$, etc. We identify these leading corrections by performing a field-theoretical calculation in a vector-meson dominance model, thereby reconciling the timelike and spacelike approaches to electromagnetic effects. Although these virtual corrections are more difficult to extract in a systematic manner, addressing them is essential for the data-driven method to consistently complement the lattice QCD program.

Simulating non-equilibrium phenomena in strongly-interacting quantum many-body systems, including thermalization, is a promising application of near-term and future quantum computation. By performing experiments on a digital quantum computer consisting of fully-connected optically-controlled trapped ions, we study the role of entanglement in the thermalization dynamics of a $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory in 2+1 spacetime dimensions. Using randomized-measurement protocols, we efficiently learn a classical approximation of non-equilibrium states that yields the gap-ratio distribution and the spectral form factor of the entanglement Hamiltonian. These observables exhibit universal early-time signals for quantum chaos, a prerequisite for thermalization. Our work, therefore, establishes quantum computers as robust tools for studying universal features of thermalization in complex many-body systems, including in gauge theories.

Quantum computers are emerging technologies expected to become important tools for exploring various aspects of fundamental physics in the future. Therefore, we pose the question of whether quantum computers can help us to study the Page curve and the black hole information dynamics, which has been a key focus in fundamental physics. In this regard, we rigorously examine the qubit transport model, a toy qubit model of black hole evaporation on IBM's superconducting quantum computers, to shed light on this question. Specifically, we implement the quantum simulation of the scrambling dynamics in black holes using an efficient random unitary circuit. Furthermore, we employ the swap-based many-body interference protocol and the randomized measurement protocol to measure the entanglement entropy of Hawking radiation qubits in this model. Finally, by incorporating quantum error mitigation techniques into our challenging implementation of entanglement entropy measurement protocols on the IBM quantum hardware, we accurately determine the Rényi entropy in the qubit transport model, thus showcasing the utility of quantum computers for future investigations of complex quantum systems.

Extracting the Speed of Sound in Heavy-Ion Collisions: A Study of Quantum-Initiated Fluctuations and Thermalization

The thermalization of quark-gluon plasma created in heavy-ion collisions is crucial for understanding its behavior as a relativistic fluid and the thermodynamic properties of the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). This study investigates the role of fluctuations in the relationship between transverse momentum and particle multiplicity, with a particular focus on their impact on extracting the QCD speed of sound. In a thermalized quark-gluon plasma, these fluctuations mostly originate from quantum fluctuations in the colliding nuclei, and exhibit a Gaussian distribution as a consequence of their independence from thermodynamic response. In contrast, non-thermalized systems display non-Gaussian fluctuations, reflecting the breakdown of thermalization. By leveraging the Gaussianity condition of quantum-initiated fluctuations, the physical value of the speed of sound can be extracted statistically, even in the presence of significant event-by-event fluctuations. This framework provides a robust diagnostic tool for probing thermalization and extracting thermodynamic properties in both large and small collision systems.

Title:
Dip and non-linearity in the curvature perturbation from inflation with a transient non-slow-roll stage

We consider models of inflation that contain a transient non-slow-roll stage and investigate the conditions under which a dip appears in the power spectrum of the curvature perturbation. Using the $\delta N$ formalism, we derive a general relation between the comoving curvature perturbation ${\cal{R}}$ and the scalar field perturbation $\delta\varphi$ and its velocity perturbation $\delta\pi$. Compared with the result obtained in linear perturbation theory, it turns out that properly taking account of the $\delta\pi$ contribution is essential to reproduce the dip in the power spectrum. Namely, the curvature perturbation is proportional to a specific linear combination of $\delta\varphi$ and $\delta\pi$ at the linear order. We also investigate the non-linearity at the dip scale and find that models with a bump or an upward step exhibit much larger non-linearity than ultra-slow-roll and Starobinsky's linear potential models. Finally, we demonstrate the importance of non-linearity by computing the probability density functions (PDFs) for the above-mentioned models and show that highly asymmetric PDFs are realised for models with a bump or a step.

The background field formalism based on effective actions is a compelling framework for developing an effective field theory for nuclear density functional theory. Among the challenges in carrying out this development is handling both the particle-hole and pairing channels beyond the mean-field level, which includes how to incorporate collective degrees of freedom. Here we use the exactly solvable one-dimensional Gaudin-Yang model as a theoretical laboratory to explore candidate approaches. We compare Variational Perturbation Theory (VPT) to ordinary many-body perturbation theory and the inversion method, all to second order in their respective expansions, and verify issues with Hubbard-Stratonovich auxiliary fields. VPT outperforms the other approaches at this level over a wide range of densities. The next steps to extend this approach toward nuclei are outlined.
