Title:
Probing Light Primordial Black Holes through Non-cold Dark Matter

We study the matter power spectrum constraint on primordial black holes (PBH) by the dark matter (DM) emitted through Hawking radiation. We particularly focus on the scenario where PBH, with mass ranges between 1g and $10^9$g, evaporates before big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN). Addition to that, we consider the case where PBH abundance is scarce and there is no early PBH domination taking place. On the DM side, we assume a fraction of the population is produced from PBH evaporation, while the remaining part is the regular cold dark matters (CDMs) which is produced by some genesis processes that decouples later on. Therefore, in the rest of the cosmological history, DM interacts solely through gravity. Under this condition, there is no thermal equilibrium ever established between DM and SM plasma. An important feature in our analysis is that, for the light PBH we consider, its temperature is much larger than the mass of DM which is consequently produced ultra-relativistically and require a protracted time to become matter-like. In this context, even though PBH evaporates in the very early Universe, PBH-produced DM could still be energetic and smooth out the small scale structure at much later time. By the precision measurement on the matter power spectrum from cosmic surveys, we are able to set joint constraint on light PBHs and the non-cold DMs it produced.

Quantum spread complexity as a probe of NSI, $CP$ Violation, and mass ordering in neutrino oscillations in matter

Quantum spread complexity characterizes how a quantum state evolves and becomes distributed over the Hilbert space under unitary dynamics. In this work, we employ a cost function as a quantitative measure of spread complexity. We investigate this cost function within the framework of three-flavor neutrino oscillations in vacuum and matter, incorporating the $CP$-violation phase and Non-Standard Interaction (NSI) effects, under both normal and inverted mass ordering scenarios. The cost function is evaluated for each scenario and analyzed with the corresponding neutrino transition probabilities for both initial muon neutrino and muon antineutrino flavor states. The results are presented using the energy where the first oscillation is maximum and baseline lengths of ongoing long-baseline accelerator neutrino experiments, including T2K and NOvA, as well as upcoming experiments such as DUNE and P2O. Our findings indicate that the difference in the cost function between normal and inverted mass orderings during neutrino propagation in matter is sensitive to these experiments, with the appropriate choice of NSI parameters and the best-fit $CP$-violation phase values.

Gluon splitting rates in an anisotropic plasma in the AMY formalism
Florian Lindenbauer

Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)
We introduce a novel numerical method to obtain the gluon splitting rates in an anisotropic QCD plasma in the AMY formalism, suitable for an anisotropic collision kernel. The method extends previous works by decomposing the additional angular information into Fourier modes, resulting in a significantly larger system of differential equations to solve numerically. It is then tested by calculating the rates for a simple anisotropic model for the collision kernel, which is compared to a thermal system. Remarkably, the obtained rates can be well-approximated by the rates calculated from an angular-averaged collision kernel, while still deviating significantly from equilibrium. An isotropic model for the collision kernel that is commonly used in QCD kinetic theory simulations, and which relies on the infrared temperature $T_*$ and an effective Debye mass, leads to rates that significantly deviate from the nonequilibrium rate, particularly at smaller parton energies.

Polarization-dependent Interference in Nonlinear Compton Scattering
Zu-dong Zhao, Suo Tang
Comments:

Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)
We investigate the phase interference effects in the nonlinear Compton scattering via the collision between an high-energy electron and the laser in the intermediate intensity region, and reveal that the importance of interference effects on the scattered photons depends sensitively on the relative polarization of the scattered photons and laser pulse. For scattered photons polarized parallel to the laser field, the effective distance between two interfered phase points is much larger than that for perpendicularly polarized photons. To signalize the phase interference effect in potential experiments, we introduce the double-pulse scenario for the scattering process, and show that the interference between two phase-separated pulse could significantly modulate the energy-momentum distribution of the scattered photons, leading to the reshaping of the scattered photons' energy spectrum. By narrowing the angular acceptance of the scattered photons, the spectral modulation can be amplified and sustained for an experiment-realizable phase separation between two pulses.

Three-body final state interactions in $B^+\to D\bar{D}K^+$ decays

Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)
This paper presents a detailed analysis of the three-body final state interactions in the $B^+\to D\bar{D}K^+$ process, whose phase space is sufficient small. To precisely extract the resonance parameters, for instance the $\chi_{c0/2}(3930)$ in the $D\bar{D}$ invariant mass distributions, in this process, one has to take into account final state interaction, especially the three-body final state interaction. We employ the dispersive Khuri-Treiman formalism, combined with a parameterization of the $D\bar{D}$ interaction based on Heavy Quark Spin Symmetry. By performing a simultaneous fit to the experimental data from LHCb, BaBar, and Belle collaborations, the scheme with three-body interaction successfully describes the invariant mass distributions of the three two-body subsystems. We precisely extract the pole structures of $\chi_{c0}(3930)$ and $\psi(3770)$ as $3.913-0.018i~\mathrm{GeV}$ and $3.764-0.002i~\mathrm{GeV}$ in $B^+$ decay. By performing the pole trajectory analysis on a uniformized complex plane, we find that both of them stem from the input bare state.

$Ξ_c \to Ξ$ Semileptonic Decays: An LCSR View on the Experiment-Lattice Tension

Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex); High Energy Physics - Lattice (hep-lat)
We present a light-cone QCD sum rule analysis of the semileptonic decays of $\Xi_c$ baryons, focusing on the channels $\Xi_c^0 \to \Xi^- \ell^+ \nu_\ell$, and $\Xi_c^+ \to \Xi^0 \ell^+ \nu_\ell$. The transition form factors are calculated within the light-cone QCD sum rules framework, using the distribution amplitudes of the heavy $\Xi_c$ baryons. The obtained form factors are then used to compute the differential and total decay widths, as well as the branching fractions. Our numerical results for the branching fractions are $\mathcal{B}(\Xi_c^0 \to \Xi^- \ell^+ \nu_\ell) = (3.73 \pm 1.04)~\%$ , $\mathcal{B}(\Xi_c^0 \to \Xi^- \mu^+ \nu_\mu) = (3.59 \pm 1.01)~\%$, $\mathcal{B}(\Xi_c^+ \to \Xi^0 \ell^+ \nu_\ell) = (11.2 \pm 3.25)~\%$, and $\mathcal{B}(\Xi_c^+ \to \Xi^0 \mu^+ \nu_\mu) = (10.8 \pm 3.13)~\%$. These results are in good agreement with recent lattice QCD calculations, while being larger than the current experimental measurements and differing from the predictions of other theoretical approaches.

Title:
On pseudo-gauge ambiguity in the distributions of energy density, pressure, and shear force inside the nucleon
Kenji Fukushima, Tomoya Uji

Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)
We study the spatial distributions of pressure, energy density, and shear forces inside the nucleon within the two-flavor Skyrme model including vector mesons. This framework has the advantage that nucleon configurations can be stabilized without the Skyrme term. In contrast to the model without vector mesons, however, we realize that the energy-momentum tensor (EMT) becomes pseudo-gauge dependent. We explicitly demonstrate that all these distributions differ between the canonical and Belinfante forms of the EMTs. We identify the pseudo-gauge ambiguity as originating from nonvanishing surface terms associated with spin currents generated by the vector-meson field strength tensors. Furthermore, we show that the pressure and shear-force distributions in the canonical EMT develop singularities at the nucleon center, whereas the corresponding Belinfante distributions remain finite. Finally, we discuss the implications of pseudo-gauge dependence for extracting the confining force and for constructing the equation of state inside the nucleon.

Higgs boson production through gluon fusion in association with two jets is an irreducible background to Higgs boson production through vector boson fusion, one of the most important channels for analyzing and understanding the Higgs boson properties at the Large Hadron Collider. Despite a range of available simulation tools, precise predictions for the corresponding final states are notoriously hard to achieve. Using state-of-the-art fixed-order calculations as the baseline for a comparison, we perform a detailed study of similarities and differences in existing event generators. We provide consistent setups for the simulations that can be used to obtain identical parametric precision in various programs used by experiments. We find that NLO calculations for the two-jet final state are essential to achieve reliable predictions.

The Seesaw Evaded Modular Dirac Framework
Manash Dey
Comments:
5 pages, 3 figures, 1 table
Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)
We posit an elegant modular $A_4$ framework for Dirac neutrinos that does not rely on the seesaw mechanism in a non SUSY setting. Our construction ensures purely Dirac neutrinos with a minimal scalar sector, naturally generating neutrino masses without requiring unnaturally tiny couplings. The model demonstrates its predictive power by simultaneously reproducing the charged lepton mass hierarchy and predicting neutrino mixing angles and mass squared differences consistent with their global best fit values. It further predicts a sum of neutrino masses consistent with the current cosmological bound, while predicting maximal Dirac CP violation. This construction offers a new paradigm for the origin of lepton masses and mixing, in sharp contrast to conventional discrete flavour symmetry and seesaw based approaches.

New opportunities for rare charm from $Z\to c\bar{c}$ decays

We analyze the potential of rare charm decays as probes of new physics at a high-luminosity flavor facility operating at the $Z$ pole, such as the FCC-ee or CEPC. In particular, we identify clean null-test observables in $D^0 \to \pi^+ \pi^- \nu\bar{\nu}$ and in polarized $\Lambda_c^+ \to p \ell^+ \ell^-$ decays with $\ell=e, \mu$. Complementarity with the LHC and HL-LHC flavor programs arises from the characteristic features of a Tera-$Z$ environment: the capability to study missing-energy modes and charm production with significant polarization. We improve the theoretical description of $D^0 \to \pi^+ \pi^- \nu\bar{\nu}$ decays and work out the phenomenology of polarization-induced null-test observables in $\Lambda_c^+ \to p \ell^+ \ell^-$ decays. In regions of dilepton mass near the $\phi$ resonance, polarization asymmetries can reach $O(5 \%)$ for muons and $O(14 \%)$ for electrons times the $\Lambda_c^+$ polarization. We also point out synergies between the dineutrino and the dilepton modes using the SMEFT framework of heavy new physics. Using the IDEA detector concept at FCC-ee, we find in simulation studies that dineutrino branching fractions as low as $\sim 2 \times 10^{-7}$ can be probed, which reaches well into the parameter space of new physics, and also allows for discrimination of lepton flavor structures. Furthermore, the measurement of asymmetries in $\Lambda_c^+ \to p \mu^+ \mu^-$ at $O(1 \%)$ will be possible. Similar sensitivities are expected for dielectron final states, although robust predictions will require further dedicated studies.

We carry out an Effective Field Theory (EFT) study of the $pp \to \bar{t} t Zh$ process in the $4b + 3 \ell + \ge 2j + \slashed{E}_T$ final state. This process can uniquely probe the $\bar{t} t Zh$ couplings arising from higher dimensional EFT operators and can also provide bounds on $\bar{t} t Z$ coupling deviations. We highlight the importance of the proposed proton-proton Future Circular Collider (FCC-$hh$) to study this process and then perform a complete collider analysis by examining the relevant background processes. This allows us to determine the FCC-$hh$ sensitivity to probe anomalous $\bar{t} t Zh$ couplings.

Gravitational Wave Signature and the Nature of Neutrino Masses: Majorana, Dirac, or Pseudo-Dirac?

The fermionic nature of neutrinos and the origin of their tiny masses remain unresolved issues in particle physics, intrinsically connected to lepton number symmetry-conserved for Dirac, violated for Majorana, and effectively pseudo-Dirac when global symmetries invoked for conservation are broken by quantum gravity. We investigate whether distinctive gravitational-wave (GW) signatures can illuminate the nature of neutrino masses and their underlying symmetries, particularly in scenarios where Yukawa couplings are not unnaturally small. To this end, we consider the minimal $B-L$ gauge extension of the Standard Model, where quantum numbers of beyond-SM states determine the neutrino nature and the scale of spontaneous $B-L$ breaking governs mass generation. In this framework, we show that neutrinos yield characteristic GW spectra: Majorana neutrinos with high-scale breaking ($\sim 10^{14}$ GeV) produce local cosmic strings and a flat spectrum across broad frequencies, Dirac neutrinos with low-scale breaking ($\sim 10^{7}$ GeV) generate peaked spectra from first-order phase transitions, and pseudo-Dirac scenarios give kink-like features from domain wall annihilation.

Plunge spectra as discriminators of black hole mimickers

Subjects:

This work explores the prospect of using the plunge to identify potential black hole mimickers. We show that the plunge excites two generic spectral features. (i) At low frequencies, there is a comb of sharp resonances at the real parts of the mimicker quasi-normal modes. (ii) Above a threshold $M\omega_{\rm th}\!\approx\!0.39$ (for the dominant mode), the spectrum undergoes a qualitative break: with the black hole mimicker displaying significant deviations from the black hole. Though individual plunge SNRs in extreme mass ratio events are low and detecting them in a sea of noise is difficult, the coherent spectral features identified here may allow for enhancing the SNR by using multiple events.

We investigate coupling selection rules in heterotic string theory on non-Abelian orbifolds. Since boundary conditions on the orbifolds are classified by conjugacy classes of space group elements, non-Abelian orbifolds give rise to non-invertible selection rules on couplings among twisted sectors as well as ones including untwisted sectors. Furthermore, we find that non-invertible selection rules lead to characteristic patterns of Yukawa matrices.

Anisotropic phases potentially play a role in the internal composition of neutron stars, the main laboratory for the phase structure of QCD at high baryon densities. We review the study of such a phase, the chiral density wave, within a phenomenological nucleon-meson model, including nucleonic vacuum fluctuations within a renormalization scheme recently developed. Neutron stars in this model and within our approximations either do not contain a chiral density wave core or they are too light to agree with observations.

We calculate the Casimir energy for the configuration of two parallel plates coupled to nonabelian gauge fields with a Yang-Mills action. We consider both 2+1 and 3+1 dimensions in the manifestly gauge-invariant formalism we have pursued over the last several years which allows us to factor out the gauge degrees of freedom. A boundary action in the functional integral, equivalent to the insertion of operators representing the plates, is used to enforce the required boundary conditions for the gauge fields. The result is for a kinematic regime corresponding to the exchange of gluons with a dynamically generated mass. We find good agreement in 2+1 dimensions and reasonable agreement in 3+1 dimensions with lattice-based numerical evaluations.

We demonstrate it for the mono-$\gamma$ signal at the electron-positron colliders, which indicates to a low-scale $T_{\rm RH}$, after addressing observed DM abundance, BBN, and other relevant constraints. The method can be used to correlate different reheating dynamics, DM models, and collider signals.

We identify a new production channel for QCD axions in supernova environments that contributes to axion emissivity for all models solving the strong CP problem. This channel arises at tree-level from a shift-symmetry-breaking operator constructed at next-to-leading order in Chiral Perturbation Theory. In scenarios where model-dependent derivative couplings to nucleons are absent, this sets the strongest model-independent constraint on the axion mass, improving on existing bounds by two orders of magnitude.

The evolution of transverse momentum dependent (TMD) distributions in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) can be formulated in a parton branching (PB) framework. We show that next-to-next-to-leading-logarithm (NNLL) accuracy can be achieved in this framework by using the concept of soft-gluon physical coupling. We present results for the TMD distributions and for the Collins-Soper kernel controlling rapidity evolution. The results pave the way for PB predictions at NNLL level for physical observables at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and future colliders.

High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)
In this article, we study the $S-$wave charmonium production at the small transverse momenta in the transverse momentum dependent (TMD) parton model (PM), as it is formulated in the soft gluon resummation (SGR) approach , using the nonrelativistic quantum chromodynamics (NRQCD) as the model of the heavy quarkonium hadronization. To extend the scope of the calculation to the phenomenologically important region of intermediate transverse momenta, we use the inverse-error weighting (InEW) matching scheme to combine the TMD PM predictions with the results of the collinear PM (CPM) fixed-order calculations, which are applicable at the large transverse momenta. We predict the direct $\eta_c$ and the prompt $J/\psi$ production cross sections and transverse momentum spectra in proton-proton collisions at the LHC, RHIC, AFTER and NICA energies. Predictions for the polarized $J/\psi$ production processes are also presented.

The goofy-symmetric Standard Model and the Hierarchy Problem

Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)
A new class of so-called "goofy" symmetries has been shown to lead to renormalization-group stable relations between parameters in two-Higgs-Doublet Models, not known before. In this work we investigate goofy transformations in the Standard Model (SM), extending them to the fermion sector. We show that the SM action is goofy "symmetric", if the Higgs mass term vanishes, while other SM interactions are allowed. Goofy symmetry could thus add another option to the very few means to successfully forbid the Higgs mass term, providing an alternative to conformal symmetry or shift symmetry. We further consider how electroweak symmetry breaking can be realized in the goofy symmetric SM via higher dimensional operators or an extended scalar sector. A viable Higgs mass can be obtained via spontaneous breaking of goofy symmetry, which can be realized via operators that would not be allowed by shift symmetry or conformal symmetry. We find that goofy-symmetric extensions of the SM are strongly constrained, but offer for example a straightforward dark matter candidate.

The surprising excess of missing-energy events far beyond all standard-model expectations in the weak decays of the charged ground-state $B^+$ meson into some charged strange meson, rather recently observed by the Belle-II experiment, may (easily) be explained by the decay of the $B$ meson into the strange meson and a pair of dark-matter fermion and antifermion, mediated by an (intermediate) scalar or vector boson. Thorough inspections of both the total and the differential widths of these decays provide, among others, a simple means for the (straightforward) discrimination of such mediator boson's scalar or vector nature.

Criterion for the Existence of the $G(3900)$ Resonance

About 18 years ago, the BABAR and the Belle Collaborations reported evidence for a new $c\bar{c}$ structure near $3900~\mathrm{MeV}$ in $e^{+}e^{-} \to D\bar{D}$, triggering debate over whether it represents a genuine hadronic state or arises from interference effects and the opening of the $D^{*}\bar{D}$ threshold. The issue remained unsettled until 2024, when BESIII, with an enlarged $e^{+}e^{-} \to D\bar{D}$ sample, confirmed the presence of the $G(3900)$ structure, reviving discussion of its nature. Although it has been proposed as a $P$-wave $D\bar{D}^{*}$ molecular state, no consensus has emerged, and interference effects remain a plausible explanation. In this Letter, we show that analyzing the $e^{+}e^{-}\to D\bar{D}$ cross section as a function of the transverse momentum of the final-state $D$ meson reveals a prominent Jacobian peak. This feature cannot be generated by interference effects alone and thus provides direct evidence for the existence of $G(3900)$. Moreover, the peak position is highly sensitive to the actual mass of $G(3900)$, offering a precise determination method. Our results further disfavor the interpretation of $G(3900)$ as a $D\bar{D}^{*}$ molecular state, pointing instead to alternative internal structures. The criterion illustrated by $G(3900)$ can be extended to other hadronic systems, offering a powerful tool to identify genuine resonances.

With the recent announcement by NASA's \textit{Planetary Science and Astrobiology Decadal Survey 2023-2032}, a priority flagship mission to the planet Uranus is anticipated. Here, we explore the prospects of using the mission's radio Doppler tracking equipment to detect gravitational waves (GWs) and other analogous signals related to dark matter (DM) over the duration of its interplanetary cruise. We develop a methodology to stack tracking data and account for time varying detector geometry, thereby constructing the sensitivity of the mission to GWs over the wide frequency range of $3\times 10^{-9}$ Hz to $10^{-4}$ Hz. We find that the mission has the potential to fill the gap between pulsar timing and space-based-interferometry GW observatories. If improvements in reducing \textit{Cassini} era noise by a factor of $\sim$10 are implemented, we forecast the detection of $\mathcal{\mathcal{O}}(\rm{few})$ individual massive black hole binaries using two independent population models. Additionally, we determine the mission's sensitivity to both astrophysical and primordial stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds, as well as its capacity to test, or even confirm via detection, ultralight DM models. In all these cases, the tracking of the spacecraft over its interplanetary cruise would enable coverage of unexplored regions of parameter space, where signals from new phenomena in our Universe may be lurking.

In this study, we investigate the impacts of dark matter (DM) on the properties of both static and rotating neutron stars utilizing a self-interacting DM model, motivated by the neutron decay anomaly. DM-admixed NSs are modeled by assuming chemical equilibrium between ordinary matter and the dark sector, treating a single-fluid Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) framework. By treating the DM interaction strength ($G$) as a free parameter, we explore its influence on NS properties, considering a broad range of equations of state (EoSs). Using the mass-radius constraints from NICER pulsar measurements, we constrain the DM interaction strength for each EoS via a likelihood analysis. Extending this model to rotating NSs, we analyze how centrifugal forces associated with increasing angular velocity ($\Omega$) enhance both mass and radius, causing deformation. We assess the impact of DM on rotational deformation by calculating the eccentricity, highlighting the interplay between DM and rotational forces. Since both DM and rotation simultaneously influence NS properties, we compute the relative changes in mass and radius across varying $G$ and $\Omega$ values to quantify their combined effects.

We study the performance of the spatially-flat dynamical dark energy (DE) $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization, with redshift-dependent DE fluid equation of state parameter $w(z) = w_0 + w_a z/(1+z)$, with and without a varying CMB lensing consistency parameter $A_L$, against Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) data (P18 and lensing) and a combination of non-CMB data composed of baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements that do not include DESI BAO data, Pantheon+ type Ia supernovae (SNIa) observations, Hubble parameter [$H(z)$] measurements, and growth factor ($f\sigma_8$) data points. From our most restrictive data set, P18+lensing+non-CMB, for the $w_0w_a$CDM+$A_L$ parameterization, we obtain $w_0=-0.879\pm 0.060$, $w_a=-0.39^{+0.26}_{-0.22}$, the asymptotic limit $w(z\to\infty) = w_0+w_a=-1.27^{+0.20}_{-0.17}$, and $A_L=1.078^{+0.036}_{-0.040}$ (all $1\sigma$ errors). This joint analysis of CMB and non-CMB data favors DE dynamics over a cosmological constant at $\sim 1\sigma$ and $A_L>1$ at $\sim 2\sigma$, i.e. more smoothing of the Planck CMB anisotropy data than is predicted by the best-fit model. For the $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization with $A_L=1$ the evidence in favor of DE dynamics is larger, $\sim 2\sigma$, suggesting that at least part of the evidence for DE dynamics comes from the excess smoothing of the Planck CMB anisotropy data. For the $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization with $A_L=1$, there is a difference of $2.8\sigma$ between P18 and non-CMB cosmological parameter constraints and $2.7\sigma$ between P18+lensing and non-CMB constraints. When $A_L$ is allowed to vary these tensions reduced to $1.9\sigma$ and $2.1\sigma$ respectively. Our P18+lensing+non-CMB data compilation positively favors the $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization without and with a varying $A_L$ parameter over the flat $\Lambda$CDM model, and $w_0w_a$CDM+$A_L$ is also positively favored over $w_0w_a$CDM.

Lattice gauge theories in varying dimensions, lattice volumes, and truncations offer a rich family of targets for Hamiltonian simulation on quantum devices. In return, formulating quantum simulations can provide new ways of thinking about the quantum structure of gauge theories. In this work, we consider pure $SU(3)$ gauge theory in two and three spatial dimensions in a streamlined version of the electric basis. We use a formulation of the theory that balances locality of the Hamiltonian and size of the gauge-invariant state space, and we classically pre-compute dictionaries of plaquette operator matrix elements for use in circuit construction. We build circuits for simulating time evolution on arbitrary lattice volumes, spanning circuits suitable for NISQ era hardware to future fault-tolerant devices. Relative to spin models, time evolution in lattice gauge theories involves more complex local unitaries, and the Hilbert space of all quantum registers may have large unphysical subspaces. Based on these features, we develop general, volume-scalable tools for optimizing circuit depth, including pruning and fusion algorithms for collections of large multi-controlled unitaries. We describe scalings of quantum resources needed to simulate larger circuits and some directions for future algorithmic development.

We derive a perturbation theory (PT) for the Lorentz boost operator in the space of two-nucleon wave functions. The latter is expressed in terms of the nucleon-nucleon ($NN$) potentials, developed so far in great detail for their use in the $NN$ scattering studies. The PT is designed to take into account the boost relativistic corrections in a systematic way and, as such, it is the only missing part in the corresponding approaches developed up to now in the low-energy effective field theories.

We investigate elliptical Wilson loops in ${\cal N}=4$ Super Yang--Mills theory at weak and strong coupling for small values of the eccentricity. We obtain analytical results for the vacuum expectation value of the Wilson loop in the form of a series in the eccentricity parameter. At weak coupling, we use perturbation theory in ${\cal N}=4$ Super Yang--Mills. At strong coupling, we use the AdS/CFT correspondence, which maps the Wilson loop to the minimal-area worldsheet of an open string in AdS space. We present a novel perturbative method to solve the Nambu--Goto equations allowing us to describe the minimal surface in terms of a coordinate parameterization in Euclidean AdS$_3$. Our results for the regularized area agree with those obtained by Dekel in [1] based on the Polyakov action.

Exact solution of the DeWitt-Brehme-Hobbs equation in copropagating electromagetic and gravitational waves

An accelerated charge interacts with itself through the electromagnetic field that it sources, a phenomenon known as electromagnetic radiation reaction. The DeWitt-Brehme-Hobbs (DWBH) equation describes the motion of a charged mass in the presence of combined electromagnetic and gravitational fields, taking into account electromagnetic radiation-reaction effects. Here, we find the first exact analytical solution of the DWBH equation in the case of a charged mass in the presence of copropagating and otherwise arbitrary electromagnetic and gravitational plane waves. Apart from its intrinsic importance, this solution approximates that of an ultrarelativistic particle in arbitrary gravitational and electromagnetic fields. Finally, the paradigmatic example of an electromagnetic wave in the presence of a constant-amplitude gravitational wave is worked out explicitly and it shows how the presence of the gravitational wave can qualitatively change electromagnetic radiation-reaction effects.

The electromagnetic structure of the nucleon can be determined from the scattering of electrons off a nucleon target. However, to study its axial structure, neutrino beams are required. The results from these experiments should be extrapolated to zero energy-momentum transfers to access the static properties of the nucleon. For baryons with strange quarks, hyperons, the static limit can instead be approached in semi-leptonic decays, which give direct access to the weak magnetism and axial-vector coupling strengths that are inaccessible in electromagnetic interactions. The axial-vector coupling as while weak magnetism coupling and the overall normalization, given by form factor $f_1$, are being determined with increased precision from the theory of strong interactions using a first principles formulation on the space--time lattice. Furthermore, the probability of the semi-leptonic hyperon decay is approximately proportional to $|V_{us}|^2\cdot (f_1^2+3g_1^2)$, where $V_{us}$ is the CKM matrix element responsible for the transition between an $s$ and a $u$ quark. Current determinations of $|V_{us}|$ come from kaon decays, but the results are not consistent and could indicate a deviation from CKM matrix unitarity, a tell-tale sign of physics beyond the Standard Model (SM) of elementary particles. Here we determine the absolute branching fraction and weak coupling strengths for $\Lambda\to p e^-\bar\nu_e$, and $\bar \Lambda\to \bar p e^+\nu_e$. These observables combined with form factors determined from first-principle lattice QCD calculations allow for the extraction of the $|V_{us}|$ value. We demonstrate how $|V_{us}|$ can be extracted with increasing sensitivity using polarized hyperons from entangled, baryon-antibaryon pairs, thus enabling a complementary road to that of meson decays. In addition, the presented experimental method can be used for other semileptonic decays of baryons.

Title:

The origin of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) is one of the intriguing mysteries in astroparticle physics. In order to identify their sources, we need precise knowledge of the mass composition of UHECRs. The direct detection of UHECRs is not feasible at energies above 0.1 PeV, necessitating the use of mass-sensitive observables of extended air showers induced by UHECRs interacting with the atmosphere. One way to achieve high statistics for these mass-sensitive observables is to use ground-based detector arrays, such as the Surface Detector (SD) of the Pierre Auger Observatory. The SD consists of three sub-arrays of independent detector stations arranged in triangular grids with different spacings. Recently, it has been shown that neural networks (NNs) can extract mass-sensitive observables from data taken by the SD-1500, the largest sub-detector of the SD. In this contribution, we demonstrate the feasibility of using NNs to reconstruct a high-level shower observable, the depth of the shower maximum, from data simulated for and observed by the SD-750, the second-largest detector array nested within the SD-1500. A simulation study shows that the SD-750 NN exhibits behavior similar to that of an SD-1500 NN and outperforms the latter in the energy range [1, 10) EeV. Moreover, we show that, after performing a correction and calibration procedure, the predictions of the SD-750 NN are consistent with the measurement of the depth of the shower maximum obtained by the Fluorescence Detector of the Pierre Auger Observatory.

Title:
Ultralight Boson Ionization from Comparable-Mass Binary Black Holes

Ultralight bosons around comparable-mass binaries can form gravitationally bound states analogous to molecules once the binary separation decreases below the boson's Bohr radius, with the inner region co-moving with the binary. We simulate the formation of these gravitational molecules, determine their co-moving regions, and compute ionization fluxes induced by orbital motion for various binary eccentricities. We develop semi-analytic formalisms to describe the ionization dynamics of both the co-moving and non-co-moving regions, demonstrating consistency with numerical simulation results. From ionization fluxes, we estimate their backreaction on binary orbital evolution. At early stages, molecule ionization can dominate over gravitational wave emission, producing a spectral turnover in the gravitational wave background. Additionally, ionization of the co-moving component occurs solely due to binary eccentricity, causing orbital circularization.
