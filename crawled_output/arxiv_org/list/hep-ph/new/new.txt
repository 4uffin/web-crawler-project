Title:
Heavy QCD Axions at High-Energy Muon Colliders

High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)
We study the physics potential of heavy QCD axions at high-energy muon colliders. Unlike typical axion-like particles, heavy QCD axions solve the strong CP problem with phenomenology driven by the anomalous gluon ($aG\widetilde G$) couplings. Several ultraviolet scenarios are presented in which QCD axions with TeV-scale masses and decay constants arise consistently with a solution to both the strong CP problem and the axion quality problem. We perform a detailed collider analysis for both a 3 and 10~TeV muon collider, focusing on hadronic axion decays that gives rise to a dijet-resonance signature. Our projections for the axion discovery reach in the multi-TeV mass range demonstrate that a muon collider can significantly extend sensitivity to heavy QCD axions compared to existing experiments.

Glauber quark and gluon contributions to quark energy loss at next-to-leading order in the highly virtual regime

The higher-twist (HT) formalism is used at $O(\alpha^2_s)$ to compute all possible medium-induced single emission scattering kernels for an incoming highly virtual and energetic quark traversing the nuclear environment. The effects of the heavy-quark mass scale are taken into account [Phys. Rev. C 94, 054902 (2016)] both in the initial state as well as in the final state, along with interactions involving both in-medium Glauber gluons and quarks [Nucl. Phys. A 793, 128 (2007)], as well as coherence effects [Phys. Rev. C 105, 024908 (2022)]. As this study is a continuation of our work on medium-induced photon production [Phys. Rev. C 112, 025204 (2025)], the general factorization procedure for $e$-$A$ deep-inelastic scattering is still used. An incoming quark energy loss in the nuclear medium yields four possible scattering kernels $\it{K}_i$ with the following final states: (i) $q+g$, (ii) $\it{g}+\it{g}$, (iii) $q+\bar{q}'$, where the quark $q$ may have a flavor different from the antiquark $\bar{q}'$, and (iv) $q+q'$, where, again, $q$ may have a flavor different from $q'$. The collisional kernels include full phase factors from all non-vanishing diagrams and complete first-order derivative in the longitudinal direction ($k^-$) as well as second-order derivative in the transverse momentum ($k_{\perp}$) gradient expansion. Furthermore, in-medium parton distribution functions and the related jet transport coefficients have a hard transverse-momentum dependence (of the emitted quark or gluon) present within the phase factor.

Leading-renormalon-free Trace-anomaly-subtracted $σ$-mass for Heavy Quarks up to Five Loops in QCD

We demonstrate that the leading IR-renormalon divergence in the perturbative pole mass of a massive quark resides entirely in the contribution from the trace anomaly of the energy-momentum tensor in QCD. Consequently, the recently proposed trace-anomaly-subtracted $\sigma$-mass definition for heavy quarks is not only scheme- and scale-invariant, but also free from the leading IR-renormalon ambiguity. We further derive a formula connecting this $\sigma$-mass to the perturbative pole mass, solely in terms of the QCD $\beta$-function, quark-mass anomalous dimension $\gamma_m$ and a proper rewritten form of the pole-to-$\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ mass conversion factor. Utilizing this formula along with the ingredients available in the literature, we present the explicit five-loop result for the perturbative relationship between the $\sigma$-mass and the perturbative pole mass in QCD under the approximation of keeping only a single quark massive. Given the theoretical merits of this mass definition and the availability of high-precision conversion relations, we encourage its application to high-energy processes with heavy quarks, e.g., $H \rightarrow b\bar{b} + X_{\mathrm{QCD}}$, and to current-current correlators used in determining heavy-quark masses and decay widths.

Collective motion in the massive Schwinger model via Tensor Network

Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Lattice (hep-lat); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)
We simulate the real-time dynamics of a massive Schwinger model using the Time-Evolving Block Decimation tensor network algorithm. Starting from a non-equilibrium initial state with localized energy excitation on top of vacuum, we track the subsequent evolution to investigate two distinct physical phenomena. First, by analyzing the system's energy-momentum tensor, we show that this system exhibits hydrodynamic behavior analogous to Bjorken flow at large coupling-to-mass ratio, a signature that diminishes as the coupling weakens, or mass increases. Second, by examining the evolution of the electric field and charge density, we observe the signal of spontaneous parity symmetry breaking phase transition in a dynamical system. The parity-restored regime is marked by ''string breaking'' and efficient charge screening, while the parity-broken regime displays stable propagation of nearly free charges and persistent electric fields connecting them.

Title:
Onset of Bjorken Flow in Quantum Evolution of the Massive Schwinger Model
Haiyang Shao, Shile Chen, Shuzhe Shi
Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Lattice (hep-lat); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)
The onset of hydrodynamics in the hot medium created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions is a crucial theoretical question. A first-principle simulation requires a real-time, non-perturbative calculation of the quantum system. In this Letter, we perform such simulations using the tensor network method, which enables large-scale quantum many-body simulations by retaining only the most essential quantum states for collective behaviors. We focus on the massive Schwinger model, a low-dimensional analog of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), as they share important properties such as confinement and chiral symmetry breaking. Starting from an initial state that puts a localized excitation atop the vacuum and mimics the energy deposition from colliding nuclei, we observe hydrodynamic behavior consistent with Bjorken flow in all relevant degrees of freedom: energy density, fluid velocity, and bulk pressure. The time scale for hydrodynamic onset aligns with the thermalization time of the quantum distribution function.

Exploring the Null Results in the Direct Detection Experiments and the $\mathbf{(g-2)_\ell}$ in an Extended $\mathbf{U(1)_{L_μ-L_τ}}$ Model Constrained through the $\mathbf{Z\to\ell^+\ell^-}$ Decays

The Direct Detection (DD) experiments are vital for probing the particle nature of the Dark Matter (DM). However, in the absence of a scattering event, DD searches result in stringent bounds on the corresponding parameter space. The paper has considered a $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$-extension of the Standard Model (SM) and augmented the particle spectrum with $SU(2)_L$-singlet vector-like leptons and scalars. Further, a discrete $Z_2$ symmetry stabilizes the lightest SM-singlet vector-like lepton as the viable DM candidate. In the proposed model, amplitude-level cancellation can be achieved for both DM-electron and DM-quark scatterings, leading to a trivial explanation for the continuous null results in the DD experiments. The framework can also induce one-loop corrections to the lepton anomalous magnetic moments and $Z\ell^+\ell^-$ couplings. The experimental bounds on the $Z\to\ell^+\ell^-$ decays are instrumental in constraining the model parameters. Particularly, using the $Z\to\tau^+\tau^-$ decay, a stronger exclusion limit can be imposed on the $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ parameter space. Future experimental updates on the $(g-2)_\ell$, $Z\to\ell^+\ell^-$ decays and improved bounds on the $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ theory can be crucial to test the proposed model. Moreover, future DD experiments searching for a DM-muon scattering might be significant to probe the considered DM-SM interaction.

Heavy tetraquarks in the hyperspherical approach

High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)
Within the quark model and hyperspherical method, the bound states of four heavy quarks and antiquarks (tetraquarks) are investigated. In hyperradial approximation, the Schroedinger equation is reduced to a one-dimensional equation after averaging over angles in hyperspace. This equation is solved numerically and analytically within the variational method. The hyperfine structure of the spectrum is calculated. To increase the accuracy of the calculation, corrections to the energy levels from the QCD generalization of the Breit Hamiltonian are taken into account.

The electromagnetic and gravitational form factors of the nucleon determined by quark and gluon contributions are calculated using the momentum transfer dependence of generalized parton distributions with different forms of parton distribution functions obtained by various Collaborations. The power forms of gravitational form factors of quarks and gluons are examined. It is shown that the gluon gravitational radius of the nucleon is comparable to the electromagnetic radius of the proton; however, the quark gravitational radius of the nucleon is less than its electromagnetic radius. It is shown that the gluon gravitational form factor drops faster than the quark gravitational form factor at large transfer momenta and corresponds to the triple form.

We examine the creation of scalar dark matter through a symmetric tensor portal. We find that both freeze-in and thermal freeze-out through a symmetric tensor mediator can create scalar dark matter. The required tensor masses for freeze-in are much larger than for freeze-out for the same dark-matter mass, in agreement with the nonthermalization assumption in freeze-in scenarios.

Sign-Flipping Axion Potentials via Kapitza-Type Modulation by Heavy Axions

Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO)
We show that the potential of a light axion can flip sign, or even nearly vanish, as a result of coherent oscillations of a heavier axion with which it mixes. This phenomenon is analogous to the Kapitza pendulum, where a high-frequency external force stabilizes an otherwise unstable configuration, but here it arises naturally from the inherent mass hierarchy and mixing among axions in the axiverse, without the need for any externally imposed modulation. We further show that a late-time sign flip of the potential can significantly enhance the abundance of the light axion, which has important cosmological and observational consequences.

Focused Angular $N$-Body Event Generator (FANG)
Itay Horin, Arik Kreisel, Or Alon
Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)
We introduce FANG (Focused Angular $n$-body event Generator), a new Monte Carlo tool for efficient event generation in restricted Lorentz-invariant phase space (LIPS). Unlike conventional approaches that uniformly sample the full $4\pi$ solid angle, FANG directly generates events in which selected final-state particles are constrained to fixed directions or finite angular regions in the laboratory frame. Because of the way the generator is constructed, angular constraints can be imposed directly in the laboratory frame while maintaining the correct LIPS structure, enabling differential and total cross sections or decay rates to be computed with high efficiency. The method is validated against analytic results and existing event generators, showing excellent agreement. By reducing computational cost by several orders of magnitude for angular observables, FANG provides a robust and versatile framework for applications in particle, nuclear, and detector physics.

Gravitational Waves from $\textit{Type-I}$ Strings in a Neutrino Mass Model

In this work, we propose a novel realization of $\textit{type-I}$ cosmic strings arising from the spontaneous breaking of an extended gauge symmetry $SU(2)_R\times U(1)_{B-L}$ in the context of a low-scale split seesaw mechanism for neutrino mass generation. We demonstrate that the split seesaw framework, which explains the smallness of neutrino masses, naturally motivates a small scalar self-coupling $\lambda$. This intrinsically links the neutrino mass generation mechanism to the formation of $\textit{type-I}$ cosmic strings, where the gauge coupling dominates over the scalar self-coupling ($\beta\equiv\lambda/2g^2<1$). We explore the cosmological implications of these strings, including their gravitational wave signatures that are testable in current and future experiments. Our findings establish a compelling and testable connection between neutrino mass generation and cosmic string phenomenology in an underexplored region of parameter space.

Investigating the two-pion exchange of the double charm $DD^*$ chiral interactions and $T_{cc}$
Hao Xu, Li-xiang Ren

16 pages, 12 figures, 1 Table
Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)
Under chiral effective field theory, we study the $S$-wave $DD^*$ interactions up to second chiral order at one-loop level, which contain full contact, one-pion-exchange (OPE) and two-pion-exchange (TPE) contributions. Here, we adopt a new subtraction scheme of the two-particle-reducible contributions, and introduce three regularization schemes uniquely for the TPE contributions since they are highly divergent on the momentum transfer. These different schemes all lead to same conclusions: In the I=0 channel, the TPE contribution is repulsive, then the competition between this powerful repulsing TPE and the other two (contact and OPE) results in a quite weak attraction. This explains why $T_{cc}$ has a extremely small binding energy if treated as the $I=0$ $DD^*$ bound state. This feature resembles that of hidden charm $D\bar{D}^*$ as we investigated in previous work [1], which also interpreted the extremely near-threshold phenomenon of $X(3872)$. In addition, we also solve the Bethe-Salpeter equation with the chiral interactions for a consistency check.

High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)
The Roper resonance $N^*(1440)$ was discovered by David Roper in 1964 through sophisticated partial-wave analyses of $\pi N$ scattering data. However the first direct observation of the Roper resonance peak in the $\pi N$ invariant mass spectrum was only realized 40 years later from the charmonium decay $J/\psi\to\bar pn\pi^+ +c.c.$ at Beijing Electron-Positron Collider. The further observations of the Roper resonance production from various charmonium decays helped to reveal its multiquark nature with large $\sigma N$ component.

Diffractive vector meson photo-production in Oxygen--Oxygen and Neon--Neon ultra-peripheral collisions at the LHC

The energy-dependent hotspot model is used to predict cross sections for vector-meson diffractive photo-nuclear production off oxygen ($\gamma$O) and neon ($\gamma$Ne) that can be extracted from ultra-peripheral O--O and Ne--Ne collisions, recently recorded at the LHC. In both cases, two models are used to describe the nuclear shapes. Woods-Saxon prescriptions for O and Ne as well as an alpha-cluster description of O and a bowling-pin-like shape for Ne, according to the PGCM formalism. Predictions are presented for the dependence on the centre-of-mass energy of the photon--nucleus system, as well as on Mandelstam-$t$, of the cross sections for the coherent and the incoherent photo-nuclear production of $\rho^{0}$ and J/$\psi$ vector mesons. Furthermore, the rapidity dependence of the ultra-peripheral cross section is reported for all cases. It is found that the incoherent process provides a measurable signature for the approach to the gluon-saturation regime, and that the simultaneous determination of $\rho^{0}$ and J/$\psi$ coherent and incoherent production provides a strong constraint on nuclear models for both O and Ne.

We report the first determination of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix elements $|V_{cs}|$ and $|V_{cd}|$ from a global fit to data from inclusive and sum-of-exclusive charm decays. Simultaneously, the heavy quark expansion parameters are determined, and they are in good agreement with results from the literature, validating the robustness of this work. With the current precision, our determined value for $|V_{cs}|$ is consistent with the world-average value extracted from exclusive charm decay processes, while a tension of approximately $3\sigma$ is observed for $|V_{cd}|$ when compared to its exclusive world-average counterpart.

Experimental Uncertainty Propagation in Neural Network Extraction in Hadronic Physics
Dustin Keller
Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)
Obtaining Compton Form Factors (CFFs) and Transverse Momentum Dependent parton distribution functions (TMDs) from experimental data using neural network-based information extraction requires the precise propagation of experimental errors. Accurate representation of uncertainties and detailed experimental covariance matrices, accounting for both statistical and systematic uncertainties, are essential for high-quality extractions. This paper explores instrumental and analytical contributions to fit and model uncertainties, along with methods for integrating these uncertainties into quantifiable results, ensuring robust extraction of physical observables across local and global datasets. Using pseudodata we demonstrate the critical role of accurate uncertainty propagation in producing meaningful results and advancing our understanding of partonic structure and dynamics inside of hardrons. \keywords{Deep neural networks \and Hadronic Physics \and Transverse momentum dependent parton distributions functions \and Compton form factors \and Uncertainty Analysis

One-loop QCD corrections to SSA in unweighted Drell-Yan processes
Guang-Peng Zhang

Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)
We study one-loop QCD corrections to the single transverse spin asymmetry in Drell-Yan process. The invariant mass of virtual photon and angular distributions of final lepton in Collins-Soper frame are measured. Especially, the transverse momentum of virtual photon is integrated out. Collinear twist-3 factorization formalism is adopted for the asymmetry. We use Feynman gauge in this work. To eliminate dependent twist-3 distribution functions, equation of motion for quark is used. We find that the soft divergence from the hard pole contribution in real corrections cannot be cancelled by corresponding divergences from virtual corrections. After collinear subtraction, the hard coefficient still contains soft divergence. Thus we conclude that collinear twist-3 factorization does not hold for this asymmetry at one-loop level.

In this letter, we present a geometric representation of the CP phases $\delta_{\rm PDG}$ and $\delta_{\rm KM}$ in the PDG and Kobayashi--Maskawa parameterizations of the mixing matrix as angles on the complex plane. The sum rule with the unitarity triangle $\delta_{\rm PDG} + \delta_{\rm KM} = \pi - \alpha + \gamma$ is geometrically expressed as a quadrangle on the complex plane, combination of a unitarity triangle and an alternative triangle. Furthermore, a new set of inverse unitarity triangles is defined from the inversion formula of a unitary matrix $U^{\dagger} = U^{-1}$. Through these unitarity triangle and quadrangle, the CP phases are no longer abstract entities but are identified with specific geometric angles.

Generalized Parton Distributions (GPDs) are multidimensional structure functions of hadrons, encoding mechanical and spin properties through the correlation of the momentum and transverse position of partons. While channels like Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering (DVCS) access GPDs in a constrained kinematic domain, Double Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering (DDVCS) offers broader access to the GPD phase space, though it remains unmeasured. We present a feasibility study of DDVCS observables using polarized electron beams at Jefferson Lab and the EIC, focusing on their sensitivity to helicity-conserving GPDs and implications for Compton Form Factor (CFF) extraction. Moreover, we provide experimental projections supporting the feasibility of the measurements at both facilities.

Inspired by the BESIII newest observation of an axial-vector particle $X(2300)$ in the $\psi(3686)\rightarrow \phi\eta \eta'$ process (Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf134}, 191901 (2025)), we simulate its production in $e^+e^-$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=4.95$ GeV using the parton and hadron cascade model PACIAE 4.0. In this model, the final partonic state (FPS) and the final hadronic state (FHS) are simulated and recorded sequentially. Besides the excited strangeonium and tetraquark interpretations, we propose for the first time that the $X(2300)$ could also be a hadro-strangeonium state, in which a strangeonium and a light hadron are bound together. The excited strangeonium and tetraquark states are, respectively, produced by coalescing with $s\bar{s}$ and $ss\bar{s}\bar{s}$ in the FPS with the quantum statistical mechanics inspired dynamically constrained phase-space coalescence (DCPC) model. The hadro-strangeonium state is generated by the recombination of $\phi\eta/\phi \eta'$ in the FHS with DCPC. We then calculate the $X(2300)$'s orbital angular momentum quantum number in its rest frame and perform the spectral classification for each of the above candidates. Given its quantum numbers $J^{PC} = 1^{+-}$, the $X(2300)$ is identified as a $P$-wave $s\bar{s}$, an $S$-wave $ss\bar{s}\bar{s}$ or an $S$-wave $\phi\eta/\phi \eta'$ candidate. The production rates for the $X(2300)$ candidates with different configurations are estimated for the first time. Those for the excited strangeonium and tetraquark states are on the order of $10^{-4}$, while the hadro-strangeonium state is produced at a rate on the order of $10^{-6}$. Moreover, significant discrepancies are observed in the rapidity distributions and the transverse momentum spectra among the different configurations. These discrepancies could be served as valuable criteria for deciphering the nature of the $X(2300)$.

Machine learning (ML) in high-energy physics (HEP) has moved in the LHC era from an internal detail of experiment software, to an unavoidable public component of many physics data-analyses. Scientific reproducibility thus requires that it be possible to accurately and stably preserve the behaviours of these, sometimes very complex algorithms. We present and document the petrifyML package, which provides missing mechanisms to convert configurations from commonly used HEP ML tools to either the industry-standard ONNX format or to native Python or C++ code, enabling future re-use and re-interpretation of many ML-based experimental studies.

High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)
We present a new extraction of unpolarized Dihadron Fragmentation Functions, which describe the probability density for an unpolarized parton to fragment into a $\pi^+ \pi^-$ pair. Our analysis is based on data from the BELLE collaboration. We improve on previous determinations in several key aspects: we employ state-of-the-art perturbative QCD calculations up to next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO); we limit the use of Monte Carlo event generators to estimating the relative contributions of different flavors, a necessary input due to the limited flavor sensitivity of the available data; and, in addition to a traditional fit based on a physics-informed functional form, we explore a Neural Network parametrization. This latter approach paves the way for more robust and flexible determinations of Dihadron Fragmentation Functions using machine learning techniques.

High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)
The diffusion of high-energy cosmic rays (CRs) through the dark matter (DM) spikes of active galactic nuclei entails significant energy loss via interactions with DM. While previous studies of sub-GeV DM have focused on elastic scattering, this process becomes insufficient at higher proton energies and DM masses. In this work, we investigate the CR-DM deep inelastic scattering (DIS) as mediated by a vector portal. We calculate the DIS contribution to the CR energy loss rate and derive stringent exclusion limits on the CR-DM scattering cross-section for DM masses between $10^{-6}$ GeV and $1$ GeV. For higher CR energies and mediator masses, the resulting CR cooling timescales are reduced by orders of magnitude after involving the DIS contribution, producing stringent constraints that surpass most of current experimental limits.

We investigate the dark parton shower effects in the direct detection of cosmic-ray boosted dark matter (CRDM), focusing on a dark photon-mediated model with fermionic dark matter-electron interactions. Utilizing a Monte Carlo framework to incorporate the Sudakov form factors and kinematic dipole recoil schemes, we simulate the CRDM energy spectrum evolution under the dark sector splitting. Our results reveal a significant energy-dependent modification of the CRDM flux. For a 1 keV dark matter (DM) mass and a coupling of $g_D=3$, the CRDM flux can be enhanced by a factor up to 1.12 in the $\mathcal{O}(10^{-2} \sim 1)$ MeV energy range for $2m_\chi \lesssim m_{A^\prime} \lesssim 10^{-2}$ MeV, while it is suppressed by more than $50\%$ at energy around 100 MeV for $m_{A^\prime} \lesssim 10^{-3}$ MeV. We then translate these effects into the experimental sensitivities for PandaX-4T, Super-Kamiokande, and JUNO. At $m_{A^\prime} = 10^{-3}$ MeV and $g_D=3$, the bounds on the kinetic mixing parameter $\epsilon^2$ are relaxed by factors of 1.02, 1.6 and 1.4, respectively. Finally, we demonstrate that the parameter space considered is consistent with those astrophysical constraints on dark matter self-interactions from observations of the Bullet Cluster.

The mass and width of the lightest scalar open-charm state listed in the Review of Particle Physics, the $D_0^\ast(2300)$, are in puzzling tension with predictions from unitarized chiral perturbation theory (UChPT) and lattice QCD, which favor a lighter state at around $2100$ MeV. However, to date, no direct experimental evidence for this lighter state exists. In an effort to facilitate a direct observation, we introduce angular asymmetries of $B\rightarrow D \pi \ell \nu$ decays that allow for a direct extraction of the $D\pi$ S-wave phase shift and discuss a novel measurement strategy for the Belle II experiment. We conduct a sensitivity study, finding that the Belle II experiment can determine the pole location with sufficient precision to firmly establish the $D_0^\ast(2100)$ using the currently available data set. We also investigate the possibility and necessary statistics of measuring the $D\pi$ isospin 1/2 scattering length with an accuracy sufficient to distinguish between the predictions from both UChPT and lattice QCD and the measurement by ALICE using femtoscopy.

New constraints on $Z^\prime$ from captured dark matter annihilation in astrophysical objects

Considering dark matter capture in astrophysical objects such as neutron stars and brown dwarfs, followed by their annihilation into two neutrino and four neutrino final states, we derive new constraints on the mass and coupling of a novel abelian gauge boson $Z^\prime$ arising from an anomaly-free $U(1)$ extension of the Standard Model. We further confront these astrophysical limits with complementary bounds from the Planck-observed relic abundance via the freeze-in mechanism, big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), gravitational wave signatures from cosmic strings, and searches at energy and intensity frontier experiments.

Bias in the tensor-to-scalar ratio from self-interacting dark radiation

We investigate the cosmological imprint of self-interacting dark radiation (DR) on the primordial $B$-mode angular power spectrum and its impact on the estimation of the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. We consider a minimal model in which DR is described as an effectively massless axion-like particle with quartic self-interactions. These interactions are incorporated into the Einstein-Boltzmann equations using the relaxation time approximation and implemented in the $\texttt{CLASS}$ code. We show that increasing the strength of DR self-interactions suppresses anisotropic stress, thereby reducing the damping of gravitational waves and leading to an enhancement of the primordial $B$-mode signal relative to the free-streaming case. Using mock CMB data and Markov Chain Monte Carlo analyses, we show that neglecting DR self-interactions may bias the inferred value of $r$ by an amount comparable to the uncertainty expected in forthcoming CMB polarization experiments, such as the ground-based $\textit{Simons Observatory}$ and the satellite missions $\textit{LiteBIRD}$ and PICO. Our results emphasize the importance of properly modeling DR interactions in future precision searches for primordial $B$-modes in order to obtain unbiased constraints on inflationary gravitational waves.

While we have several complementary models of confinement, some of which are phenomenologically appealing, we do not have the ability to calculate analytically even simple aspects of confinement, let alone have a framework to eventually prove confinement. The problem we are facing is to evolve the theory from the perturbative regime to the long distance confining regime. This is generally achieved by renormalization group transformations. With the gradient flow we now have a technique to address the problem from first principles. The primary focus is on the running coupling $\alpha_S(\mu)$, from which confinement can be concluded alone. A central point is that the gluon condensate is scale invariant, which reflects its self-similar behavior across different scales. Building on that, we derive $\alpha_S(\mu) \simeq \Lambda_S^2/\mu^2$, which evolves to the infrared fixed point $1/\alpha_S = 0$ in accordance with infrared slavery. This shows that the only important factor is the presence of homogeneous vacuum fields, represented by condensates, which is a universal feature that QCD shares with many other models. The analytical statements are supported by numerical simulations.

Probing For Non-Gravitational Long-Range Dark Matter Interactions

Dark matter remains a mystery in fundamental physics. The only evidence for dark matter's existence is from gravitational interactions. We constructed a precision torsion balance experiment to search for non-gravitational, long-range interactions between ordinary matter in our lab and the Milky Way's dark matter. We find no evidence of such interaction and set strict upper bounds on its strength. These results suggest that dark matter only interacts gravitationally over long distances and constrains a variety of dark matter theories.

Early JWST observations reveal an unexpectedly abundant population of high-redshift candidate massive galaxies at $z \gtrsim 7$, and recent DESI measurements show a preference for dynamical dark energy, which together present a significant challenge to the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. In this work, we jointly analyze high-redshift galaxy data from JWST, baryon acoustic oscillations data from DESI DR2, and cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from Planck and ACT, measuring the total neutrino mass $\sum m_{\nu}$. We consider three dark energy models ($\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, and $w_0w_a$CDM) and three mass hierarchies. Our results indicate that in the $w_0w_a$CDM model, adding JWST data to CMB+DESI tightens the upper limit of $\sum m_{\nu}$ by about $5.8\%-10.2\%$, and we obtain $\sum m_{\nu} < 0.167~\mathrm{eV}$ ($2\sigma$) in the normal hierarchy (NH) case. Furthermore, JWST also offers indicative lower limits on star formation efficiency parameter of $f_{*,10} \gtrsim 0.146-0.161$. Bayesian evidence weakly favors the $w_0w_a$CDM+$\sum m_{\nu}$(NH) model relative to the $\Lambda$CDM+$\sum m_{\nu}$(NH) model using CMB+DESI+JWST data. These results suggest that the joint analysis of high-redshift JWST data and low-redshift DESI data provides compelling constraints on neutrino mass and merits further investigation.

A Dark Matter Model with Quadratic Equation of State: Background Evolution and Structure Formation

We propose that dark matter (DM) possesses a quadratic equation of state, which becomes significant at high densities, altering the Universe's evolution during its early stages. We derive the modified background evolution equations for the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ and the DM density parameter $\Omega_{\text{dm}}(z)$. We then perturb the governing equations to study the linear growth of matter fluctuations, computing the observable growth factor $f\sigma_8(z)$. Finally, we compare the model with the latest cosmological data, including Hubble parameter $H(z)$ measurements, and growth factor $f\sigma_8(z)$ data, up to $z=3$. Our results indicate that the quadratic model, while remaining consistent with background observations, offers a distinct imprint on the growth of structure, providing not only a new phenomenological avenue to address cosmological tensions but also shedding light on the nature of DM.

Dual is Different: EFTs, Axions and Nonpropagating Form Fields in Cosmology

Scalar fields in 4D are known to have equivalent dual descriptions in terms of form-field gauge potentials, but this is often regarded as an arcane fact. Why use more complicated formulations when simpler scalar descriptions exist and are equivalent? We describe three ways in which scalars that arise as duals can differ from their garden-variety counterparts. Two of these -- the interchange of weak and strong couplings and utility in bringing topological information to the low-energy theory -- are relatively well-known, but to these we add a third: dualities that map derivative interactions to non-derivative interactions seem not to commute with the general power-counting arguments that quantify control over the low-energy approximation within any EFT involving gravity. Since both sides of the duality must agree on their low-energy limit, the non-derivative interactions on the scalar side of the duality turn out to be suppressed relative to what would generically be assumed. They are nonetheless technically natural, as is particularly clear in the dual formulation. We argue that scalar fields arising as duals (such as the universal axion $a$ from string vacua) that have the commonly assumed $J^\mu \partial_\mu a$ interaction with matter also have $J^\mu J_\mu$ contact interactions among the respective currents, some of whose implications we explore. We also emphasize the non-trivial role and cosmological implications of non-propagating 3-form gauge potentials and clarify confusing statements recently made in the literature regarding the validity of duality for massive form fields.

QCD Effective Lagrangian and Condensation of Chromomagnetic Flux Tubes
George Savvidy

Subjects:

Vacuum polarisation effects induced by the sourceless solutions of the Yang-Mills equation are investigated. These solutions represent oppositely oriented chromomagnetic flux tubes permeating the space in all directions. We review and prove the gauge invariance of the effective Lagrangian on sourceless gauge fields and present a number of alternative methods allowing to compute the effective Lagrangian. We compute the effective Lagrangian on chromomagnetic flux tube solutions and demonstrate that the effective Lagrangian has a universal form that supports the stability of the chromomagnetic flux tubes condensation and indicates that the Yang-Mills vacuum is a highly degenerate state. The stability is a result of the quartic nonlinear self-interaction of the negative mode completely eliminating the instability and the imaginary term from the effective Lagrangian in chromomagnetic field. It is suggested that the condensate of chromomagnetic flux tubes represents a dual analog of the Cooper pairs condensate in a superconductor.

Simulating out-of-equilibrium dynamics of quantum field theories in nature is challenging with classical methods, but is a promising application for quantum computers. Unfortunately, simulating interacting bosonic fields involves a high boson-to-qubit encoding overhead. Furthermore, when mapping to qubits, the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space of bosons is necessarily truncated, with truncation errors that grow with energy and time. A qubit-based quantum computer, augmented with an active bosonic register, and with qubit, bosonic, and mixed qubit-boson quantum gates, offers a more powerful platform for simulating bosonic theories. We demonstrate this capability experimentally in a hybrid analog-digital trapped-ion quantum computer, where qubits are encoded in the internal states of the ions, and the bosons in the ions' motional states. Specifically, we simulate nonequilibrium dynamics of a (1+1)-dimensional Yukawa model, a simplified model of interacting nucleons and pions, and measure fermion- and boson-occupation-state probabilities. These dynamics populate high bosonic-field excitations starting from an empty state, and the experimental results capture well such high-occupation states. This simulation approaches the regime where classical methods become challenging, bypasses the need for a large qubit overhead, and removes truncation errors. Our results, therefore, open the way to achieving demonstrable quantum advantage in qubit-boson quantum computing.

By extending our analysis and simulations of our $^{37}$K $\beta$-decay data set to allow the $\beta$ asymmetry with respect to nuclear spin to vary with $\beta$ energy $E_{\beta}$, we have gained sensitivity to new physics that depends on a helicity factor for the $\beta$, $m_\beta/E_\beta$.
In particular, we constrain Lorentz scalar and tensor quark-lepton interaction strengths at a sensitivity complementary to the similar Fierz interference term in neutron $\beta$ decay.
Our result for that new physics is
$b_F$ = -0.0002 $\pm$ 0.024 (stat) $\pm$ 0.039 (syst),
consistent with the standard model electroweak interaction value $b_F=0$. We consider presently achieved complementarity to $\beta$-decay and particle physics experiments, along with projectable technical improvements to our method.

We investigate axion-like particles coupled to gravity through a parity-violating Chern-Simons (CS) interaction. In this framework, axion dark matter (DM) can decay into pairs of circularly polarized gravitons, producing a persistent, nearly monochromatic GW signal. We compute the expected signal at Earth assuming a Navarro-Frenk-White Galactic halo model with the corresponding velocity distribution, and compare it with the narrowband sensitivities of the LIGO O4 run and the projected reach of the Einstein Telescope. The resulting bounds on the axion-graviton coupling $\alpha$ improve upon the cosmological stability requirement for axion masses $m_\phi \lesssim 10^{-11}$ eV, excluding values up to four orders of magnitude below the stability limit. This constitutes a robust direct terrestrial constraint on the axion-gravity CS coupling. We also discuss distinctive observational signatures, such as circular polarization asymmetries, annual modulation, and potential enhancements from DM substructures, which could serve as smoking-gun evidence for parity-violating gravitational interactions.

Method of regions for dual conformal integrals

Subjects:

We apply the method of regions to the evaluation of dual conformal integrals with small off-shellness. In contrast to conventional approach, where the separation of regions is performed via dimensional regularization which breaks the dual conformal invariance (DCI) of separate contributions, we use the regularization which is sufficiently generic combination of dimensional and analytic regularizations which preserves the DCI. Within this regularization, the contribution of each region becomes DCI. We show that our method dramatically simplifies the calculations. As a demonstration, we calculate a slightly off-shell DCI pentabox integral up to power corrections. The contributions of all 32 regions appear to be expressible in terms of $\Gamma$-functions thus giving, after removing the regularization, the final expression in terms of cross-ratios logarithms only. We have checked that our result for pentabox integral numerically agrees with the result of the recent Belitsky&Smirnov paper [arXiv:2508.14298] which has essentially more complicated form.

The electroweak magnetic monopole in the presence of KSVZ axion

Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)
The Witten effect implies the dynamics of axion and magnetic monopole. The Cho-Maison monopole is a realistic electroweak monopole arisen in the Weinberg-Salam theory. This monopole of TeV scale mass motivates the dedicated search for electroweak monopole at colliders. In this work we investigate the implication of KSVZ axion to the electroweak magnetic monopole. We use the spherically symmetric ansatz for the electroweak dyon and introduce the spherically symmetric function for the axion field. The effective Lagrangian is then shown in terms of the electroweak monopole part, the axion kinetic energy as well as the axion interaction term. We derive the consequent equations of motion in the presence of the axion-photon coupling and show the numerical results of the topological solutions. We then calculate the changed characteristics of the electroweak monopole such as the monopole mass and the electromagnetic charges, as well as the axion potential energy.

Recent high-precision $e^+e^-\to c\bar{c}$ data from the BESIII and Belle are highly useful to understand vector charmonium ($\psi$) pole structures and puzzling lineshapes due to the exotic hadron candidates $Y$. We thus perform a global coupled-channel analysis of most of the available data (10 two-body, 9 three-body, and 1 four-body final states) in $\sqrt{s}=3.75-4.7$ GeV. Not only cross sections but also invariant-mass distributions of subsystems are fitted. The $e^+e^-\to \mu^+\mu^-$ cross sections are also predicted. Our model includes dozens of (quasi) two-body states that nonperturbatively couple with each other through bare $\psi$ excitations, particle-exchange, and short-range mechanisms; approximate three-body unitarity is considered. The amplitudes obtained from the fit are analytically continued to $\psi$ and $Z_c$ poles. We find $\psi$ states similar to those in the Particle Data Group listing and $Y(4320)$. Moreover, several $\psi$ states, including new ones, are found close to open charm thresholds. Trajectories and compositeness of the near-threshold poles suggest dominant hadron-molecule contents in their internal structures. Two $Z_c$ poles are found as virtual states $\sim$40 MeV below the $D^*\bar{D}^{(*)}$ thresholds, being consistent with lattice QCD results. This work presents the first global analysis to determine $\psi$ and $Z_c$ poles, thereby paving the way to extracting detailed properties of the prominent exotic hadron candidates from data.

We consider the most general form of soft and collinear factorization for hard-scattering amplitudes to all orders in perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics. Specifically, we present the generalization of collinear factorization to configurations with several collinear directions, where the most singular behaviour is encoded by generalized collinear splitting amplitudes that manifestly embed the breaking of strict collinear factorization in space-like collinear configurations. We also extend the analysis to the simultaneous soft-collinear factorization with multiple collinear directions where na\"ıve multiplicative factorization does not hold. As an illustrative example of factorization breaking, we present explicit results at the one-loop level in the soft-collinear limit.

In the attempt to explain possible data anomalies from collider experiments in terms of New Physics (NP) models, computationally expensive scans over their parameter spaces are typically required in order to match theoretical predictions to experimental observations. Under the assumption that anomalies seen at a mass of about 95 GeV by the Large Electron-Positron (LEP) and Large Hadron Collider (LHC) experiments correspond to a NP signal, which we attempt to interpret as a spin-0 resonance in the $(B-L)$ Supersymmetric Standard Model ($(B-L)$SSM), chosen as an illustrative example, we introduce a novel Machine Learning (ML) approach based on a multi-objective active search method, called b-CASTOR, able to achieve high sample efficiency and diversity, due to the use of probabilistic surrogate models and a volume based search policy, outperforming competing algorithms, such as those based on Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods.

We present a new approach to determining the strong coupling $\alpha_s(Q)$, over the entire range of validity of perturbative QCD, for scales above $\Lambda_{\mathrm{QCD}}$ and up to the Planck scale $\sim1.22\cdot10^{19}$\,GeV, with the highest precision and using the data of a single experiment. In particular, we use the results obtained for the thrust ($T$) and $C$-parameter ($C$) distributions in $e^+e^-$ annihilation at a single annihilation energy $\sqrt{s}=M_Z$ (i.e.\ at the $Z^0$ peak). This new method is based on the \emph{intrinsic conformality} (iCF) and on the Infinite-Order Scale Setting, using the Principle of Maximum Conformality (i.e.\ the PMC$_\infty$), which allows a rigorous determination of the renormalization scales for the event-shape variable distributions satisfying all of the requirements of Renormalization Group Invariance, including renormalization-scheme independence and consistency with Abelian theory in the $N_C \to 0$ limit. This new method is based on the scale-invariance of the iCF, which allows determination of $\alpha_s(\mu_0)$ at any scale $\mu_0$, and on the Maximum Likelihood statistical approach. We propose a novel approach to determining the best-fitting range by considering all possible intervals over the entire range of bins available in the perturbative region and selecting that which returns the most-likely-lowest $\chi^2_{\rm min}$. This new method is designed to eliminate the errors that arise due to selection of the bin-interval and that have been neglected in previous analyses. In particular, using data for thrust and $C$-parameter at the $Z^0$ peak from ALEPH, OPAL, DELPHI and L3 experiments, we obtain the average value: $\alpha_s(M_Z)= 0.1182^{+0.0007}_{-0.0007}$, for the strong coupling. This determination of $\alpha_s(M_Z)$ is consistent with the world average...

The recent demonstration of laser excitation of the $\approx 8$ eV isomeric state of Thorium-229 is a significant step towards a nuclear clock. The low excitation energy likely results from a cancellation between electromagnetic and strong contributions, which new physics can disrupt. In this Letter, we quantify the enhancement of a nuclear clock's sensitivity to new physics using a geometric model and a novel $d$-wave halo model of the nucleus that reproduces measured differences between Thorium-229 states. We find likely enhancements of order $10^4$ while a worst case scenario with enhancement $\ll 1$ is unlikely.

We employ the renormalization group optimized perturbation theory (RGOPT) resummation method to evaluate the equation of state (EoS) for strange ($N_f=2+1$) and non-strange ($N_f=2$) cold quark matter at NLO. This allows us to obtain the mass-radius relation for pure quark stars and compare the results with the predictions from perturbative QCD (pQCD) at NNLO. Choosing the renormalization scale to generate maximum star masses of order $M=2 - 2.6 M_\odot$, we show that the RGOPT can produce mass-radius curves compatible with the masses and radii of some recently observed pulsars, regardless of their strangeness content. The scale values required to produce the desired maximum masses are higher in the strange scenario since the EoS is softer in this case. The possible reasons for such behavior are discussed. Our results also show that, as expected, the RGOPT predictions for the relevant observables are less sensitive to scale variations than those furnished by pQCD.

LHCb Collaboration first observed a doubly charmed baryon $\Xi^{++}_{cc}$ in the $\Lambda^{+}_{c}K^{-}\pi^{+}\pi^{+}$ decay with a mass of $3621.40\pm0.72\pm0.27$ MeV. In this paper, we enumerated the mass spectra of the radial and orbital excited states for the doubly heavy $\Xi_{QQ^{\prime}}$ and $\Omega_{QQ^{\prime}}$ baryons using the Regge trajectory model and the scaling rules. Our studies suggest that $\Xi^{++}_{cc}$ can be grouped into the $1S$-wave state with the spin-parity quantum number $J^{P} = 1/2^{+}$. On the other hand, the mass of $\Xi_{cc}$ state with $J^{P} = 3/2^{+}$ is predicted to be $3699.69 \pm 4.59$ MeV. We also predict the mass spectra of the unknown ground and excited states for the doubly heavy $\Xi_{QQ^{\prime}}$ and $\Omega_{QQ^{\prime}}$ baryons, which provide useful references for the experimental test in the future.

Strong first-order phase transitions in a dark sector offer a compelling explanation for the stochastic gravitational wave background in the nano-Hertz range recently detected by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). We explore the possibility that such a phase transition at the same time gives mass to a stable fermion that accounts for the observed dark matter abundance and leads to testable effects in laboratory experiments. Concretely, we consider a classically conformal dark sector with a hidden $U(1)^\prime$ gauge symmetry that couples to the Standard Model via kinetic mixing. Since the PTA signal requires a phase transition in the MeV temperature range, spontaneous symmetry breaking gives rise to a sub-GeV dark matter candidate that couples to the Standard Model via a dark photon mediator and obtains its relic abundance via annihilations into electrons and dark Higgs bosons. Such a scenario is tightly constrained by laboratory searches for dark photons and cosmological constraints on the decays of dark Higgs bosons after the phase transition. We show that viable parameter regions can be found both for the case that the dark Higgs bosons remain in equilibrium with the Standard Model and that they decouple and only decay much later. In the latter case, the parameter regions preferred by the PTA signal and the dark matter relic abundance can be fully explored by future beam-dump experiments searching for missing energy.

We analyze the gravitational form factors and mechanical properties of the nucleon, focusing on both some general issues as well as on modeling with meson dominance. We show that the lattice QCD results for the nucleon gravitational form factors at $m_\pi=170$~MeV, available for space-like momentum transfer squared up to 2GeV, are explained in a natural way within the meson dominance approach. We carry out the proper Raman spin decomposition of the energy-momentum tensor and in each spin channel use a minimum number of resonances consistent with the perturbative QCD short-distance constraints. These constraints are related to the super-convergence sum rules, following from the asymptotic perturbative QCD fall-off of the form factors. The value of the nucleon $D$-term following from the fits is -3.0(4). Next, we obtain the two-dimensional transverse gravitational densities of the nucleon in the transverse coordinate $b$. With the super-convergence sum rules, we derive new sum rules for these densities at the origin and for their derivatives, involving logarithmic weighting in the corresponding spectral density integrals. From analysis of the threshold behavior in the time-like region and the properties of the $\pi\pi \to N\bar{N}$ reaction, we infer the behavior of the transverse densities at asymptotically large coordinates. We also carry out the meson dominance analysis of the two- and three-dimensional mechanical properties of the nucleon (the pressure and stress) and explore their connection to the spectral densities via dispersion relations.

We study the thermal behavior of quarkonia and fully-heavy tetraquark states associated to the charmonium, bottomonium and bottom-charmonium mass spectra. The starting point is the Schrödinger formalism with a vacuum Cornell-like potential. The spin-spin, spin-orbit and tensor contributions are also considered to describe the structure of the vacuum quarkonia $Q\bar Q$ spectra ($Q$ denoting $c,b$ quarks). The parameters of the model are fixed using the experimental data of the $Q\bar Q$ states. After that, this formalism is extended to the fully-heavy tetraquark states within the $1^3 S_1$ axial diquark--$1^3 S_1$ axial antidiquark configuration $[QQ] [\bar Q \bar Q]$, and their vacuum mass spectra are obtained and compared to the experimental data recently obtained. Our predictions support the interpretation of the $X(6600)$ (or $X(6552)$), $X(6900)$ and $X(7200)$ states as the radially-excited $T_{4c}(n^1S_0)$ configurations with $n=2,3,4$. In the sequence, we evaluate the mass spectra behavior in a thermal medium, by introducing a modified temperature-dependent Cornell potential. As a consequence, this formalism enables us to get some insight into the dissociation mechanism of $[QQ] [\bar Q \bar Q]$ states caused by a thermal medium, and into the temperature range at which the tetraquark states might be formed. We find that these structures cannot be formed in the thermal medium when the system has a temperature higher than about twice the critical temperature. These findings may be useful to better understand the features of the exotics in heavy-ion collisions.

We report the first analytic calculation of the Higgs boson decay width to gluons up to next-to-leading order in quantum chromodynamics including full dependence on the bottom and charm quark masses. The interference between top- and bottom/charm-quark-induced amplitudes provides unexpectedly large contributions because the large logarithms of the bottom (charm) quark masses over the Higgs boson mass compensate for the suppression of the Yukawa coupling. These logarithms exhibit a unique structure distinct from Sudakov resummation and more complex than the Higgs-gluon-gluon form factor. Our results demonstrate that the previous calculation with massless bottom and charm quarks overestimates the decay width by nearly 20%. The prediction of the partial decay width with massive quarks provides essential theory input needed in the precise determination of Higgs couplings at future colliders.

Within the framework of general $U(1)$ scenario, we demonstrate that the ultra high energy neutrinos recently detected by KM3NeT could originate from a decaying right handed neutrino dark matter (DM), with a mass of 440 PeV. Considering DM production via freeze-in, we delineate the parameter space that satisfies the observed relic abundance and also lies within the reach of multiple gravitational wave detectors. Our study provides a testable new physics scenario, enabled by multi-messenger astronomy.

This report, summarising work achieved in the context of the LHC Dark Matter Working Group, investigates the phenomenology of $t$-channel dark matter models, spanning minimal setups with a single dark matter candidate and mediator to more complex constructions closer to UV-complete models. For each considered class of models, we examine collider, cosmological and astrophysical implications. In addition, we explore scenarios with either promptly decaying or long-lived particles, as well as featuring diverse dark matter production mechanisms in the early universe. By providing a unified analysis framework, numerical tools and guidelines, this work aims to support future experimental and theoretical efforts in exploring $t$-channel dark matter models at colliders and in cosmology.

Sufficiently strong and long-lasting first-order phase transitions can produce primordial black holes (PBHs) that contribute substantially to the dark matter abundance of the Universe, and can produce large-scale primordial magnetic fields. We study these mechanisms in a generic class of conformal $\mathrm{U(1)}^\prime$ models that also explain active neutrino oscillation data via the type-I seesaw mechanism. We find that phase transitions that occur at seesaw scales between $10^4$ GeV and $10^{11}$ GeV produce gravitational wave signals (from the dynamics of the phase transition and from the decay of cosmic string loops) at LISA/ET that can be correlated with microlensing signals of PBHs at the Roman Space Telescope, while scales near $10^{11}$ GeV can be correlated with Hawking evaporation signals at future gamma-ray telescopes. LISA can probe the entire range of PBH masses between $1\times 10^{-16}M_\odot$ and $8\times 10^{-11}M_\odot$ if PBHs fully account for the dark matter abundance. For Z' masses between 40 TeV and $10^4$ TeV, and 10 TeV right-handed neutrinos, helical magnetic fields can be produced with magnitudes $\gtrsim 0.5$ pG and coherence lengths $\gtrsim 0.008$ Mpc, above current blazar lower bounds.

This work explores how the generalized uncertainty principle, a theoretical modification of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle inspired by quantum gravity, affects neutrino flavor oscillations. By extending the standard two-flavor neutrino model, we show that the oscillation probability acquires an additional phase term that depends on the {square roots of the individual neutrino masses}, introducing new features beyond the conventional mass-squared differences. To account for the non-Hermitian nature of the resulting dynamics, we employ parity-time ($PT$) symmetric quantum mechanics, which allows for consistent descriptions of systems with {balanced gain and loss mechanisms}. We analyze the feasibility of observing these effects in current and future neutrino experiments, such as DUNE, JUNO, IceCube, ORCA--KM3NeT, MINOS, Daya Bay, Hyper-Kamiokande, and KATRIN, and find that the predicted modifications could fall within the sensitivity of current experiments. Moreover, we propose that analog quantum simulation platforms, such as cold atoms, trapped ions, and photonic systems, offer a promising route to test these predictions under controlled conditions. Our findings suggest that neutrino oscillations may serve as an effective probe of quantum gravity effects, providing a novel connection between fundamental theory and experimental observables.

Charmed baryon decays: $SU(3)_F$ breaking and CP violation

We present a comprehensive study of anti-triplet charmed baryon decays into octet baryons and pseudoscalar mesons using the $SU(3)_F$ flavor symmetry framework. By decomposing the flavor structure, all decay amplitudes are parametrized with a minimal set of irreducible amplitudes, and the Körner-Pati-Woo theorem further reduces the number of independent parameters from the original 35 to 19 under exact symmetry when small terms proportional to $\lambda_b = V_{cb}^*V_{ub}$ are neglected. The independent number becomes 27 with leading $SU(3)_F$ breaking effects. A global fit to 51 experimental measurements yields a $\chi^2$/d.o.f. of 2.36 and provides precise values for the decay amplitudes. Notable discrepancies are observed in the fitted branching fractions of $\Xi_c^0 \to \Xi^- \pi^+$ and $\Xi_c^+ \to \Xi^- \pi^+ \pi^+$, which exceed current measurements by more than $2\sigma$. Incorporating final-state rescattering effects to recover the main effects of terms proportional to $\lambda_b$, we predict enhanced CP violation, with $A_{CP}$ reaching up to $10^{-3}$ in golden channels such as $\Xi_c^0 \to p K^-$ and $\Xi_c^0 \to \Sigma^+ \pi^-$. Our analysis also finds that the branching ratio for $\Xi_c^+ \to \Lambda \pi^+$ is enhanced to $(9.7 \pm 1.2) \times 10^{-4}$ due to significant cancellations.

High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)
We investigate Higgs Parity Unification-a realization of $SO(10)$ grand unification based on the Higgs Parity mechanism in which the Standard Model (SM) Higgs resides in a spinor representation. The theory has an intermediate left-right symmetric stage where the $SU(2)_R$ symmetry breaking scale is fixed by the vanishing of the SM Higgs quartic coupling. The strong $CP$ problem is solved by parity. Gauge coupling unification successfully predicts $\alpha_s(M_Z)$ to within 1%. The spinor Higgs naturally leads to a seesaw origin for SM flavor observables. We identify a novel mechanism where large mixing of third generation fermions with additional heavy vector-like fermions accounts for the anarchical nature of the PMNS matrix and the lack of hierarchy in the neutrino mass spectrum, relative to the up-quarks. A fit to quark and lepton masses and mixings, with a minimal parameter set, predicts 1) A testable relation between the top quark mass and $\alpha_s(M_Z)$ which is about $(1-2)\sigma$ from current best fit values, 2) The order of magnitude of the baryon asymmetry of the universe, via leptogenesis from second-generation right-handed neutrino decays. 3) The proton decay and the neutron EDM are likely observable in next generation experiments, and 4) A normal ordered neutrino mass spectrum where $0\nu \beta \beta$ decay and the mass of the lightest neutrino are out of reach of next generation experiments.

High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)
The single Higgs production in neutral-current (NC) and charged-current (CC) processes at an electron-proton ($ep$) collider is a useful channel to probe new physics effects in the Higgs coupling to vector boson ($HVV$). In this context, observables sensitive to non-standard couplings previously studied at leading order require improved theoretical precision through the inclusion of radiative corrections. In this work, we present a fully differential Higgs plus one jet production at next-to-leading-order (NLO) accuracy in QCD for both the NC and CC processes. For the proposed Large Hadron electron Collider (LHeC) configuration, with a 60~GeV electron beam and a 7~TeV proton beam, the total cross sections receive modest corrections with significantly reduced scale uncertainties. We find that in several kinematic distributions which are relevant to the analysis of $HVV$ couplings, the NLO K-factors are not flat. Within the Standard Model, the polar angle of the electron (for NC) and the azimuthal angular correlation (for both NC and CC processes) receive maximum corrections in the range of 8-10\% in certain bins. We also compute NLO QCD corrections in the presence of non-standard $HVV$ interactions. The corrections in the azimuthal angular correlations are similar to the standard model predictions. For the polar angle of the electron, the corrections are sensitive to the nature of the $HVV$ coupling.

Two-particle cumulant distribution: a probe of "true" elliptic flow

Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)
In this work, we have shown the two-particle correlations of charged hadrons in d-Au collisions at 200 GeV. These correlations were studied at different multiplicities and pseudorapidity intervals. The two-particle correlations arise due to Color Reconnections, resonance decays, jet correlations, and "jet-like" correlations of low-energy partons in softer interactions. These correlations are inversely proportional to multiplicity but remain unaffected (slowly increase) for larger pseudorapidity windows. We treated these correlations as distributions and calculated their skewness and kurtosis. The non-flow distributions deviate greatly from a Gaussian distribution and have high skewness and kurtosis. The "true" elliptic flow distributions resemble Gaussian distributions; they have significantly lower skewness and kurtosis. We suggest that if the two-particle cumulant flow is treated as a distribution, its skewness and kurtosis can be instrumental in distinguishing true flow and non-flow.

In this paper we consider the general structure of irreducible tensor representations of the Poincare group of arbitrary dimension with multiple sets of Lorentz indices and different ways to construct them from basic elements (Lorentz vectors and the metric tensor). Then we apply the same methods to obtain the expansion of general hadronic tensors in terms of these irreducible tensors. We propose to use an effective approach in hadronic diffraction, which was usually called covariant reggeization, and obtain basic functions to calculate all the diffractive cross-sections.

We show that the directed flow of $\phi$-mesons in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=3$ GeV, is sensitive on production and the absorption cross section of the $\phi$ in a nuclear medium. This provides a new observable to constrain the in-medium properties of the $\phi$ which is independent of its absolute production rate. It is shown that the STAR data disfavor any significant $\phi$-N absorption in dense nuclear matter and are consistent with a very small cross section of the $\phi$ comparable to the vacuum cross section. The similarity of the $\phi$-meson and proton directed flow also indicates that the $\phi$ is produced in conjunction with a baryon.

In this work, we study the charged-current (anti)neutrino-induced associated particle($K\Lambda$) production($\Delta S=0$) from free nucleons in the energy region of a few GeV, relevant to the (anti)neutrino oscillation experiments with accelerator and atmospheric neutrinos. We employ a model based on effective Lagrangians to evaluate the contributions from the nonresonant and the resonant diagrams. The nonresonant background terms are calculated using a microscopic model derived from the SU(3) chiral Lagrangians. For the resonant contributions, we consider the low-lying spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ resonances, such as $S_{11}(1650)$, $P_{11}(1710)$, $P_{11}(1880)$, and $S_{11}(1895)$, and spin-$\frac{3}{2}$ resonances, such as $P_{13}(1720)$ and $P_{13}(1900)$, which have finite branching ratios to the $K\Lambda$ channel. These resonant contributions are modelled using an effective phenomenological Lagrangian approach, with strong couplings determined from the experimental branching ratios and the decay widths to the $K\Lambda$ channel. To fix the parameters of the vector current interaction, the model is first used to reproduce satisfactorily the MAMI experimental data on the real photon induced scattering off the nucleon resulting an eta meson in the final state and with the CLAS data for the $K\Lambda$ production in the final state. The PCAC hypothesis and the generalized Goldberger-Treiman relation are used to fix the parameters of the axial vector interaction. The model is then applied to study the weak production of $K\Lambda$ induced by the neutrinos and antineutrinos, and predicts the numerical values for the $Q^2$-distribution, the kaon kinetic energy distribution, and the total scattering cross sections with and without a cut on the CM energy W. The results presented in this work are relevant for the present and future accelerator and atmospheric neutrino experiments.

We investigate energy correlators (ECs) in semi-inclusive electron-positron annihilation as precision probes of parton hadronization dynamics. Using soft-collinear effective theory (SCET), we analyze the correlation patterns between the examined hadron and the rest of QCD radiations in both large-angle and small-angle limits, which establishes a direct correspondence with Transverse-Momentum-Dependent Fragmentation Functions (TMD FFs) and Semi-Inclusive Energy Correlators (SIECs). The two complementary regimes encode the transition from perturbative parton branching to nonperturbative confinement, enabling a unified description of hadron formation across all polar angles. Using renormalization group evolution, we obtain joint N3LL/NNLL quantitative predictions for energy correlations both in the sudakov and jet fragmentation region (JFR). Our results demonstrate that semi-inclusive ECs provide direct, theoretically controlled access to QCD dynamics underlying hadronization, opening new avenues for precision studies at future lepton colliders.

We study the spatial distributions of pressure, energy density, and shear forces inside the nucleon within the two-flavor Skyrme model including vector mesons. This framework has the advantage that nucleon configurations can be stabilized without the Skyrme term. In contrast to the model without vector mesons, however, we realize that the energy-momentum tensor (EMT) becomes pseudo-gauge dependent. We explicitly demonstrate that all these distributions differ between the canonical and Belinfante forms of the EMTs. We identify the pseudo-gauge ambiguity as originating from nonvanishing surface terms associated with spin currents generated by the vector-meson field strength tensors. Furthermore, we show that the pressure and shear-force distributions in the canonical EMT develop singularities at the nucleon center, whereas the corresponding Belinfante distributions remain finite. Finally, we discuss the implications of pseudo-gauge dependence for extracting the confining force and for constructing the equation of state inside the nucleon.

We posit an elegant modular $A_4$ framework for Dirac neutrinos that does not rely on the seesaw mechanism in a non SUSY setting. Our construction ensures purely Dirac neutrinos with a minimal scalar sector, naturally generating neutrino masses without requiring unnaturally tiny couplings. The model demonstrates its predictive power by simultaneously reproducing the charged lepton mass hierarchy and predicting neutrino mixing angles and mass squared differences consistent with their global best fit values. It further predicts a sum of neutrino masses consistent with the current cosmological bound, while predicting maximal Dirac CP violation. This construction establishes an alternative paradigm for the origin of lepton masses and mixing, setting it apart from conventional discrete flavour symmetry and seesaw based approaches.

We explore the impact of perturbative pions on the Unitarity Expansion in the two-nucleon S-waves of Chiral Effective Field Theory at next-to-next-to leading order. Pion exchange explicitly breaks the nontrivial fixed point's universality and invariance under conformal and Wigner-$\SU(4)$ spin-isospin transformations. This Chiral Effective Field Theory applies tothe Unitarity Window (45deg<delta(k)<135deg,$k\approx m_\pi$) most relevant for low-energy nuclear systems. Its only LO scale is the scattering momentum; NLO adds only scattering length, effective range and non-iterated one-pion exchange (OPE); and N2LO only once-iterated OPE. Agreement in the 1S0 channel is very good. Apparent large discrepancies in the 3S1 channel at k>100MeV are remedied by taking only the central part of the pion's N2LO contribution. In contradistinction to the tensor part, it is invariant under Wigner-SU(4)symmetry and hence identical in 1S0 and 3S1. NLO pions are Wigner-invariant. Both channels describe PWAs and pole parameters well within mutually consistent quantitative theory uncertainty estimates. Pionic effects are small, even for k>mpi. Empirically determined breakdown scales agree well with $\Lambda_{NN}=\frac{16\pi f_\pi^2}{g_A^2M}=300\;$MeV where iterated OPE is not suppressed. We therefore conjecture: The footprint of both scale invariance and Wigner-symmetry in the Unitarity Expansion shows persistence,i.e. both dominate even for k=mpi and are more relevant than chiral symmetry,so that the tensor/Wigner-SU(4) symmetry-breaking part of OPE does not enter before N3LO. We also discuss the potential relevance of entanglement power and possible resolution of a conflict with the strength of the tensor interaction in the large-Nc expansion.

We investigate the relationship between nonlocal and local quantum field theories, and search for a viable notion of "local limit" to relate the unitary models. In Euclidean space it is relatively easy to have nonlocal theories with well-behaved local limits. In Minkowski spacetime, instead, singular behaviors are generically expected. Relaxing some assumptions on the "form factors" considered in the literature, we identify a class of models that have regular local limits in Minkowski spacetime. We call the models "asymptotically local" quantum field theories (AL-QFTs) and show that their limits are theories with physical and purely virtual particles (PVPs). In the bubble diagram, the nonlocal deformation generates PVPs straightforwardly. In the triangle diagram, it does so possibly up to multi-threshold corrections, which may be adjusted by tuning the deformation itself. We also build an asymptotically local deformation of quantum gravity with purely virtual particles. AL-QFT can serve various purposes, such as suggesting innovative approaches to off-shell physics, providing an alternative formulation for theories with PVPs, or smoothing out nonanalytic behaviors. We discuss its inherent arbitrariness and the implications for renormalizability.

We find empirically that the value of Feynman integrals follows a $\log$-$\Gamma$ distribution at large loop order. This result opens up a new avenue towards the large-order behavior in perturbative quantum field theory. Our study of the primitive contribution to the scalar $\phi^4$ beta function in four dimensions up to 17 loops provides accompanying evidence. Guided by instanton considerations, we discuss the extrapolation of this contribution to all loop orders.

Generalized relativistic second-order dissipative hydrodynamics: coupling different rank tensors

In this work, we extend the formalism of second-order relativistic dissipative hydrodynamics, developed previously using Zubarev's non-equilibrium statistical operator formalism. By employing a second-order expansion of the statistical operator in terms of hydrodynamic gradients, we demonstrate that new second-order terms emerge due to the coupling of two-point quantum correlators between tensors of differing ranks, evaluated at distinct space-time points. Such terms arise because the presence of the acceleration vector in the system allows Curie's theorem, which governs symmetry constraints, to be extended for constructing invariants from tensors of different ranks evaluated at distinct space-time points. The new terms are identified in the context of a complete set of second-order equations governing the shear-stress tensor, bulk-viscous pressure, and charge-diffusion currents for a generic quantum system characterized by the energy-momentum tensor and multiple conserved charges. Additionally, we identify the transport coefficients associated with these new terms and derive the Kubo formulas expressing the second-order transport coefficients through two- and three-point correlation functions.

This study tackles the impact Dark Energy (DE) in different systems by a simple unifying formalism. We introduce a parameter space that compare gravity across all cosmic scales, using the McVittie spacetime (McV) and connects spherically symmetric solutions with cosmological solutions. By analyzing the invariant scalars: the Ricci, Weyl, and Kretschmann scalars, we develop a phase-space description that predicts the dominance of the Cosmological Constant. We explore three cases: (1) the local Hubble flow around galaxy groups and clusters, (2) spherical density distributions and (3) binary motion. Our results show that the Kretschmann scalar of galaxy groups and clusters in their turnaround is $2\Lambda^2$ which is three times the Kretschmann scalar of the Cosmological Consonant. This quantifies the DE domination in local structures.

We introduce an algorithm that samples a set of loop momenta distributed as a given Feynman integrand. The algorithm uses the tropical sampling method and can be applied to evaluate phase-space-type integrals efficiently. We provide an implementation, momtrop, and apply it to a series of relevant integrals from the loop-tree duality framework. Compared to naive sampling methods, we observe convergence speedups by factors of more than $10^6$.

We confront the star formation rate in different dark matter (DM) models with UV luminosity data from JWST up to $z\simeq25$ and legacy data from HST. We find that a transition from a Salpeter population to top-heavy Pop-III stars is likely at $z\simeq10$ and that beyond $z=10-15$ the feedback from supernovae and active galactic nuclei is progressively reduced, so that at $z\simeq25$ the production of stars is almost free from any feedback. We compare fuzzy and warm DM models that suppress small-scale structures with the CDM paradigm, finding that the fuzzy DM mass $> 4.5 \times 10^{-22}{\rm eV}$ and the warm DM mass $> 1.5\, {\rm keV}$ at the 95\% CL. The fits of the star formation rate parametrization do not depend strongly on the DM properties within the allowed range. We find no preference over CDM for enhanced matter perturbations associated with axion miniclusters or primordial black holes. The scale of the enhancement of the power spectrum should be $> 27\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ at the 95\% CL, excluding axion miniclusters produced for $m_a < 7.5 \times 10^{-17}\,{\rm eV}$ or heavy primordial black holes that constitute a fraction $f_{\rm PBH} > {\rm Max}[88 M_{\odot}/m_{\rm PBH}, 10^{-4} (m_{\rm PBH}/10^4 M_{\odot})^{-0.09}]$ of DM.

The generalized Lanczos algorithm can provide a universal method for constructing the wave function under the group structure of Hamiltonian. Based on this fact, we obtain an open two-mode squeezed state as the quantum origin for the curvature perturbation. In light of this wave function in the open system, we successfully develop a new method to calculate its corresponding power spectrum by using the Bogoliubov transformation. Unlike traditional approaches, we explicitly retain the Bogoliubov coefficients in terms of the squeezing amplitude \( r_k \) and the squeezing rotation angle \( \phi_k \). As a result, the power spectrum of the open two-mode squeezed state will match that of the Bunch-Davies vacuum numerically. Furthermore, the derivation of the open two-mode squeezed state relies on the second kind Meixner polynomial (equivalent to the generalized Lanczos algorithm) and the symmetry of the Hamiltonian. Therefore, our research may offer a new insight into the calculation of the correlation functions through a group-theoretic perspective.

Analog gravity experiments are making remarkable strides in unveiling both the classical and quantum nature of black holes. By harnessing diverse states of matter, contemporary tabletop setups now replicate strong-field phenomena typically confined to the enigmatic regions surrounding black holes. Through these modern gravity simulators, physical processes once considered elusive may finally be brought into experimental reach. In this work, we investigate the spectrum of massless scalar excitations propagating within the effective geometry of a rotating acoustic metric. Specifically, we build an analog vortex-like spacetime endowed with a tunable parameter that emulates the geometry of a rotating gravitational background. This model accommodates both the presence of a sonic horizon, characteristic of an acoustic black hole for non-zero tuning parameters, and its absence when the parameter vanishes, yielding a horizonless, purely rotational vortex flow devoid of radial inflow. We focus on the case where the vortex flow is purely rotational. The resulting spectral properties is found to be qualitatively consistent with that observed in recent experimental realizations of giant multiply quantum vortices featuring solid or hollow cores. This correspondence suggests that the analog spacetime used here holds significant potential to replicate, qualitatively, the phenomenology of cutting-edge laboratory experiments. In doing so, it offers new insight into the intricate landscape of analog black-hole spectroscopy and, potentially, the resonant topography of bounded, rotating astrophysical environments around black holes.

UrQMD Simulations of Higher-order Cumulants in Au+Au Collisions at High Baryon Density

High moments of conserved quantities such as net-baryon, net-electric charge, and net-strangeness in heavy-ion collisions are sensitive to fluctuations caused by the QCD critical point (CP). The event-by-event analysis of high moments of the conserved charges has been widely used in experiments to search for the CP, especially in the RHIC-STAR experiment.
In order to establish a {\it dynamical non-critical base line}, especially at the high baryon density region, we have performed a systematic analysis of the proton multiplicity distributions from Au+Au collisions at 3 $\leq$ $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ $\leq$ 9.2 GeV collisions. The results on beam energy, centrality and rapidity width dependence of proton (factorial) cumulants, up to the $4^{th}$ order, are extracted from the calculations of the hadronic transport model UrQMD. In addition, the effects of initial volume fluctuation is also discussed. These results will be important when we do physics analysis the RHIC beam energy scan (BES) data, especially for the fixed-target data and experimental data from future CBM experiment at FAIR.

Thermodynamics of Kerr black hole: Tsallis-Cirto composition law and entropy quantization
G.E. Volovik

4 pages, no figures
Subjects:

The processes of splitting and merging of black holes obey the composition law generated by the Tsallis-Cirto $\delta=2$ statistics. The same composition law expresses the full entropy of the Reissner-Nordström black hole via the entropies of its outer and inner horizons. He we apply this composition law to the entropy of the Kerr black hole. As distinct from Reissner-Nordström black hole, where the full entropy depends only on mass $M$ and does not depend on its charge $Q$, the entropy of Kerr black hole is the sum of contributions from its mass $M$ and angular momentum $J$, i.e. $S(M,J)=S(M,0) + 4\pi \sqrt{J(J+1)}$. Here $S(M,0)$ is the entropy of the Schwarzschild black hole. This demonstrates that when the Kerr black hole with $J\gg 1$ absorbs or emits a massless particle with spin $s_z=\pm 1/2$, its entropy changes by $|\Delta S| = 2\pi$. We also considered the quantization of entropy suggested by the toy model, in which the black hole thermodynamics is represented by the ensemble of the Planck-scale black holes -- Planckons.

Quantum Vacuum energy as the origin of Gravity
André LeClair

We explore the idea that quantum vacuum energy $\rho_{\rm vac} $ is at the origin of Gravity as a theoretical exercise. We formulate a gravitational version of the electromagnetic Casimir effect, and provide an argument for how gravity can arise from $\rho_{\rm vac} $ by showing how Einstein's field equations emerge in the form of Friedmann's equations. This leads to the idea that Newton's constant $G_N$ is environmental, namely it depends on the total mass-energy of the Universe $M_\infty $ and its size $R_\infty $, with $G_N = c^2 R_\infty /2 M_\infty$. This leads to a new interpretation of the Gibbons-Hawking entropy of de Sitter space, and also the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy for black holes, wherein the quantum information bits are quantized massless particles at the horizon with wavelength $\lambda = 2 \pi R_\infty$. We assume a recently proposed formula for $\rho_{\rm vac} \sim m_z^4/\mathfrak{g}$, where $m_z$ is the mass of the lightest particle, and $\mathfrak{g}$ is a marginally irrelevant coupling. This leads to an effective, induced RG flow for Newton's constant $G_N$ as a function of an energy scale, which indicates that $G_N$ decreases at higher energies until it reaches a Landau pole at a minimal value of the cosmological scale factor $a(t) > a_{\rm min}$, thus avoiding the usual geometric singularity at $a=0$. The solution to the scale factor satisfies an interesting symmetry between the far past and far future due to $a(t) = a(-t + 2 t_{\rm min})$, where $a(t_{\rm min}) = a_{\rm min}$. We propose that this energy scale dependent $G_N$ can explain the Hubble tension and we thereby constrain the coupling constant $\mathfrak{g}$ and its renormalization group parameters. For the $\Lambda{\rm CDM}$ model we estimate $a_{\rm min} \approx e^{-1/\hat{b} }$ where $\hat{b} \approx 0.02$ based on the Hubble tension data.

We present the first directed searches for long-transient and continuous gravitational waves from ultralight vector boson clouds around known black holes (BHs). We use LIGO data from the first part of the fourth LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run. The searches target two distinct types of BHs and use two new semicoherent methods: hidden Markov model (HMM) tracking for the remnant BHs of the mergers GW230814_230901 and GW231123_135430 (referred to as GW230814 and GW231123 in this study), and a dedicated method using the Band Sampled Data (BSD) framework for the galactic BH in the Cygnus X-1 binary system. Without finding evidence of a signal from vector bosons in the data, we estimate the mass range that can be constrained. For the HMM searches targeting the remnants from GW231123 and GW230814, we disfavor vector boson masses in the ranges $[0.94, 1.08]$ and $[2.75, 3.28] \times 10^{-13}$ eV, respectively, at 30% confidence, assuming a 1% false alarm probability. Although these searches are only marginally sensitive to signals from merger remnants at relatively large distances, future observations are expected to yield more stringent constraints with high confidence. For the BSD search targeting the BH in Cygnus X-1, we exclude vector boson masses in the range $[0.85, 1.59] \times 10^{-13}$ eV at 95% confidence, assuming an initial BH spin larger than 0.5.
