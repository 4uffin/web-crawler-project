In natural ecosystems and human societies, self-organized resource allocation and policy synergy are ubiquitous and significant. This work focuses on the synergy between Dual Reinforcement Learning Policies in the Minority Game (DRLP-MG) to optimize resource allocation. Our study examines a mixed-structured population with two sub-populations: a Q-subpopulation using Q-learning policy and a C-subpopulation adopting the classical policy. We first identify a synergy effect between these subpopulations. A first-order phase transition occurs as the mixing ratio of the subpopulations changes. Further analysis reveals that the Q-subpopulation consists of two internal synergy clusters (IS-clusters) and a single external synergy cluster (ES-cluster). The former contribute to the internal synergy within the Q-subpopulation through synchronization and anti-synchronization, whereas the latter engages in the inter-subpopulation synergy. Within the ES-cluster, the classical momentum strategy in the financial market manifests and assumes a crucial role in the inter-subpopulation synergy. This particular strategy serves to prevent long-term under-utilization of resources. However, it also triggers trend reversals and leads to a decrease in rewards for those who adopt it. Our research reveals that the frozen effect, in either the C- or Q-subpopulation, is a crucial prerequisite for synergy, consistent with previous studies. We also conduct mathematical analyses on subpopulation synergy effects and the synchronization and anti-synchronization forms of IS-clusters in the Q-subpopulation. Overall, our work comprehensively explores the complex resource-allocation dynamics in DRLP-MG, uncovers multiple synergy mechanisms and their conditions, enriching the theoretical understanding of reinforcement-learning-based resource allocation and offering valuable practical insights

Chaotic Dynamics (nlin.CD); Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems (nlin.AO)
We demonstrate the deterministic coherence and anti-coherence resonance phenomena in two coupled identical chaotic Lorenz oscillators. Both effects are found to occur simultaneously when varying the coupling strength. In particular, the occurrence of deterministic coherence resonance is revealed by analysing time realizations $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ of both oscillators, whereas the anti-coherence resonance is identified when considering oscillations $z(t)$ at the same parameter values. Both resonances are observed when the coupling strength does not exceed a threshold value corresponding to complete synchronization of the interacting chaotic oscillators. In such a case, the coupled oscillators exhibit the hyperchaotic dynamics associated with the on-off intermittency. The highlighted effects are studied in numerical simulations and confirmed in physical experiments, showing an excellent correspondence and disclosing thereby the robustness of the observed phenomena.

Title:
Convective Space-Time Chaos as a Dynamical Model of Deterministic and Stochastic Turbulence
Arkady Pikovsky
Subjects:
Chaotic Dynamics (nlin.CD)
Recently, a concept of deterministic and stochastic turbulence has been introduced based on experiments with a boundary layer. A deterministic property means that identical random perturbations at the inlet lead to identical patterns downstream; during this stage, the non-identical, stochastic component grows and eventually dominates the flow further downstream. We argue that these properties can be explained by exploring the concept of convective space-time chaos, where secondary perturbations on top of a chaotic state grow but move away in the laboratory reference frame. We illustrate this with two simple models of convective space-time chaos, one is a partial differential equation describing waves on a film flowing down a plate, and the other is a set of unidirectionally coupled ordinary differential equations. To prove convective space-time chaos, we calculate the profiles of the convective Lyapunov exponent. The repeatability of the turbulent field in different identical experimental runs corresponds to the reliability of stable dynamical systems in response to random forcing. The onset of the stochastic component is quantified with the spatial Lyapunov exponent. We demonstrate how an effective randomization of the field is observed when the driving is quasiperiodic. Furthermore, we discuss space-time duality, which links sensitivity to boundary conditions in the convective space-time chaos to the usual sensitivity to initial conditions in a standard chaotic regime.

Title:
Symmetry Groups of Basins of Attraction in Equivariant Dynamical Systems
Xiao Xie
Subjects:
Chaotic Dynamics (nlin.CD); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Dynamical Systems (math.DS)
This paper investigates the symmetry properties of basins of attraction and their boundaries in equivariant dynamical systems. While the symmetry groups of compact attractors are well understood, the corresponding analysis for non-compact basins and their boundaries has remained underdeveloped. We establish a rigorous theoretical framework demonstrating the hierarchical inclusion of a chain of symmetry groups, showing that boundary symmetries can strictly exceed those of attractors and their basins. To determine admissible symmetry groups of basin boundaries, we propose three complementary approaches: (i) thickening transfer, which connects admissibility results from compact attractors to basins; (ii) algebraic constraints, which exploit the closed nature of boundaries to impose structural restrictions; and (iii) connectivity and flow analysis, which analyzes how the system's dynamics permute states. Numerical experiments on the Thomas system confirm these theoretical results, illustrating that cyclic group actions permute basins while preserving their common boundary, whereas central inversion leaves both basins and boundaries invariant. These findings reveal that basin boundaries often exhibit higher symmetry than the attractors they separate, providing new insights into the geometry of multistable systems and suggesting broader applications to physical and biological models where basin structure determines stability and predictability.

The $r$-matrix structure on the moduli space of framed Higgs pairs

Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems (nlin.SI); Symplectic Geometry (math.SG)
On the space of matrices with rational (trigonometric/elliptic) entries there is a well-known Lie-Poisson $r$-matrix structure. The known $r$-matrices are defined on the Riemann sphere (rational), the cylinder (trigonometric), or the torus (elliptic). We extend the formalism to the case of a Riemann surface $\mathcal C$ of higher genus $g$: we consider the moduli space of framed vector bundles of rank $n$ and degree $ng$, where the framing consists in a choice of basis of $n$ independent holomorphic sections chosen to trivialize the fiber at a given point $\infty\in \mathcal C$. The co-tangent space is known to be identified with the set of Higgs fields, i.e., one-forms on $\mathcal C$ with values in the endomorphisms of the vector bundle, with an additional simple pole at $\infty$. The natural symplectic structure on the co-tangent bundle of the moduli space induces a Poisson structure on the Higgs fields. The result is then an explicit $r$--matrix that generalizes the known ones. A detailed discussion of the elliptic case with comparison to the literature is also provided.

Emergent order from mixed chaos at low temperature

This paper explores a novel connection between a thermodynamic and a dynamical systems perspective on emergent dynamical order. We provide evidence for a conjecture that Hamiltonian systems with mixed chaos spontaneously find regular behavior when minimally coupled to a thermal bath at sufficiently low temperature. Numerical evidence across a diverse set of five dynamical systems supports this conjecture, and allows us to quantify corollaries about the organization timescales and disruption of order at higher temperatures. Balancing the damping-induced phase-space contraction against thermal exploration, we are able to predict the transition temperatures in terms of the relaxation timescales, indicating a novel nonequilibrium fluctuation-dissipation relation, and formally connecting the thermodynamic and dynamical systems views. Our findings suggest that for a wide range of real-world systems, coupling to a cold thermal bath leads to emergence of robust, non-trivial dynamical order, rather than a mere reduction of motion as in equilibrium.

Determining the boundary of dynamical chaos in the generalized Chirikov map via machine learning
Daniil Chernyshov, Arkady Satanin, Lev Shchur
Subjects:
Chaotic Dynamics (nlin.CD)
We investigate the boundary separating regular and chaotic dynamics in the generalized Chirikov map, an extension of the standard map with phase-shifted secondary kicks. Lyapunov maps were computed across the parameter space (K, K{\alpha}, {\tau} ) and used to train a convolutional neural network (ResNet18) for binary classification of dynamical regimes. The model reproduces the known critical parameter for the onset of global chaos in the standard map and identifies two-dimensional boundaries in the generalized map for varying phase shifts {\tau} . The results reveal systematic deformation of the boundary as {\tau} increases, highlighting the sensitivity of the system to phase modulation and demonstrating the ability of machine learning to extract interpretable features of complex Hamiltonian dynamics. This framework allows precise characterization of stability boundaries in nontrivial nonlinear systems.

Predator-Prey Model: Driven Hunt for Accelerated Grokking

Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE); Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems (nlin.AO)
A machine learning method is proposed using two agents that simulate the biological behavior of a predator and a prey. In this method, the predator and the prey interact with each other - the predator chases the prey while the prey runs away from the predator - to perform an optimization on the landscape. This method allows, for the case of a ravine landscape (i.e., a landscape with narrow ravines and with gentle slopes along the ravines) to avoid getting optimization stuck in the ravine. For this, in the optimization over a ravine landscape the predator drives the prey along the ravine. Thus we also call this approach, for the case of ravine landscapes, the driven hunt method. For some examples of grokking (i.e., delayed generalization) problems we show that this method allows for achieving up to a hundred times faster learning compared to the standard learning procedure.

Geometric Phase of Stochastic Oscillators

Several definitions of phase have been proposed for stochastic oscillators, among which the mean-return-time phase and the stochastic asymptotic phase have drawn particular attention. Quantitative comparisons between these two definitions have been done in previous studies, but physical interpretations of such a relation are still missing. In this work, we illustrate this relation using the geometric phase, which is an essential concept in both classical and quantum mechanics. We use properties of probability currents and the generalized Doob's h-transform to explain how the geometric phase arises in stochastic oscillators. Such an analogy is also reminiscent of the noise-induced phase shift in oscillatory systems with deterministic perturbation, allowing us to compare the phase responses in deterministic and stochastic oscillators. The resulting framework unifies these distinct phase definitions and reveals that their difference is governed by a geometric drift term analogous to curvature. This interpretation bridges spectral theory, stochastic dynamics, and geometric phase, and provides new insight into how noise reshapes oscillatory behavior. Our results suggest broader applications of geometric-phase concepts to coupled stochastic oscillators and neural models.

Blowup relations and $q$-Painlevé VI
Artem Stoyan

Subjects:
Mathematical Physics (math-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems (nlin.SI)
We propose and study blowup relations obeyed by the partition functions of $5d$ $\mathcal{N}=1$ (quiver) SYM theories with $SU(2)$ gauge group and four flavours. By analyzing the Weyl group action on the sets of blowup relations, we identify the integer parameters of a blowup relation with the weights of a corresponding Lie algebra. We also explain how this action of the Weyl group follows from the Weyl group symmetry of the partition function. Finally, we use these relations to derive bilinear relations on the $q$-Painlevé VI tau functions.

In this work, we investigate new solutions to the decoration transformation in terms of various special functions, including the hyperbolic gamma function, the basic hypergeometric function, and the Euler gamma function. These solutions to the symmetry transformation are important to decorate Ising-like integrable lattice spin models obtained via the gauge/YBE correspondence. The integral identities represented as the solution of the decoration transformation are derived from the three-dimensional partition functions and superconformal index for the dual supersymmetric gauge theories.

Subjects:

The $l$-hypermaps, $l\ge2$, which generalize (dual of) ribbon graphs ($l=2$ case), are interesting enumerative objects. In this paper, based on a theorem of Carlet--van de Leur--Posthuma--Shadrin and the matrix-resolvent method, we derive an explicit formula for $k$-point generating series of enumeration of $l$-hypermaps, which generalizes the one obtained in [30] for the $l=2$ case. We also generalize a theorem of Dubrovin [29].

The complex systems keyword diagram generated by the author in 2010 has been used widely in a variety of educational and outreach purposes, but it definitely needs a major update and reorganization. This short paper reports our recent attempt to update the keyword diagram using information collected from the following multiple sources: (a) collective feedback posted on social media, (b) recent reference books on complex systems and network science, (c) online resources on complex systems, and (d) keyword search hits obtained using OpenAlex, an open-access bibliographic catalogue of scientific publications. The data (a), (b) and (c) were used to incorporate the research community's internal perceptions of the relevant topics, whereas the data (d) was used to obtain more objective measurements of the keywords' relevance and associations from publications made in complex systems science. Results revealed differences and overlaps between public perception and actual usage of keywords in publications on complex systems. Four topical communities were obtained from the keyword association network, although they were highly intertwined with each other. We hope that the resulting network visualization of complex systems keywords provides a more up-to-date, accurate topic map of the field of complex systems as of today.

Pattern Formation and Solitons (nlin.PS); Cell Behavior (q-bio.CB)
Eukaryotic cells demonstrate a wide variety of dynamic patterns of filamentous actin (F-actin) and its regulators. Some of these patterns play important roles in cell functions, such as distinct motility modes, which motivate this study. We devise a mass-conserved reaction-diffusion model for active and inactive Rho-GTPase and F-actin in the cell cortex. The mass-conserved Rho-GTPase system promotes F-actin, which feeds back to inactivate the former. We study the model on a 1D periodic domain (edge of thin sheet-like cell) using bifurcation theory in the framework of spatial dynamics, complemented with numerical simulations. Among several discussed bifurcations, the analysis centers on the study of the codimension-2 long wavelength and finite wavenumber Hopf instability, in which we describe a rich structure of steady wave-pinning states (a.k.a. mesas, obeying the Maxwell construction), propagating coherent solutions (fronts and excitable pulses), and travelling and standing waves, all distinguished by mass conservation regimes and classified by domain sizes. Specifically, we highlight the unexpected conditions for bistability between steady wave-pinning and travelling wave states on moderate domain sizes. These results uncover and exemplify possible mechanisms of coexistence, robustness, and transitions between distinct cellular motility modes, including directed migration, turning, and ruffling. More broadly, the results indicate that dissipative reaction-diffusion models comprising mass conservation have distinct pattern formation mechanisms that motivate further investigations, such as the unfolding of codimension-3 instabilities and T-points.

The direct linearization scheme with the Lamé function: The KP equation and reductions

Comments:

Subjects:
Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems (nlin.SI)
The paper starts from establishing an elliptic direct linearization (DL) scheme for the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation. The scheme consists of an integral equation (involving the Lamé function) and a formula for elliptic soliton solutions, which can be confirmed by checking Lax pair. Based on analysis of real-valuedness of the Weierstrass functions, we are able to construct a Marchenko equation for elliptic solitons. A mechanism to obtain nonsingular real solutions from this elliptic DL scheme is formulated. By utilizing elliptic $N$th roots of unity and reductions, the elliptic DL schemes, Marchenko equations and nonsingular real solutions are studied for the Korteweg-de Vries equation and Boussinesq equation. Illustrations of the obtained solutions show solitons and their interactions on a periodic background.

The real part of the focusing modified Korteweg-de Vries (MKdV) equation defined over the complex field $\mathbb{C}$ is reduced to the focusing gauged MKdV (FGMKdV) equation. In this paper, we construct the real hyperelliptic solutions of FGMKdV equation in terms of data of the hyperelliptic curves of genus $g$ and demonstrate the closed hyperelliptic plane curves of genus $g=5$ whose curvature obeys the FGMKdV equation by extending the previous results of genus three (Matsutani, {\it{J.

Adversarial control of synchronization in complex oscillator networks

This study investigates perturbation strategies inspired by adversarial attack principles from deep learning, designed to control synchronization dynamics through strategically crafted weak perturbations. We propose a gradient-based optimization method that identifies small phase perturbations to dramatically enhance or suppress collective synchronization in Kuramoto oscillator networks. Our approach formulates synchronization control as an optimization problem, computing gradients of the order parameter with respect to oscillator phases to determine optimal perturbation directions. Results demonstrate that extremely small phase perturbations applied to network oscillators can achieve significant synchronization control across diverse network architectures. Our analysis reveals that synchronization enhancement is achievable across various network sizes, while synchronization suppression becomes particularly effective in larger networks, with effectiveness scaling favorably with network size. The method is systematically validated on canonical model networks including scale-free and small-world topologies, and real-world networks representing power grids and brain connectivity patterns. This adversarial framework represents a novel paradigm for synchronization management by introducing deep learning concepts to networked dynamical systems.

Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems (nlin.SI)
We obtain the complete Lie point symmetry algebras of two sequences of odd-order evolution equations. This includes equations that are fully-nonlinear, i.e. nonlinear in the highest derivative. Two of the equations in the sequences have recently been identified as symmetry-integrable, namely a 3rd-order equation and a 5th-order equation [Open Communications in Nonlinear Mathematical Physics, Special Issue in honour of George W Bluman, ocnmp:15938, 1--15, 2025]. These two examples provided the motivation for the current study. The Lie-Bäcklund symmetries and the consequent symmetry-integrability of the equations in the sequences are also discussed.

We consider the preparation of all the eigenstates of spin chains using quantum circuits. It is known that generic eigenstates of free-fermionic spin chains can be prepared with circuits whose depth grows only polynomially with the length of the chain and the number of particles. We show that the polynomial growth is also achievable for selected interacting models where the interaction between the particles is sufficiently simple. Our working example is the folded XXZ model, an integrable spin chain that exhibits Hilbert space fragmentation. We present the explicit quantum circuits that prepare arbitrary eigenstates of this model on an open chain efficiently. We perform error-mitigated noisy simulations with circuits of up to 13 qubits and different connectivities between qubits, achieving a relative error below 5%. As a byproduct, we extend a recent reformulation of the Bethe ansatz as a quantum circuit from closed to open boundary conditions.

The chaotic dynamics of small-scale vorticity plays a key role in understanding and controlling turbulence, with direct implications for energy transfer, mixing, and coherent structure evolution. However, measuring or controlling its dynamics remains a major conceptual and experimental challenge due to its transient and chaotic nature. Here we use a combination of experiments, theory and simulations to show that small magnetic particles of different densities, exploring flow regions of distinct vorticity statistics, can act as effective probes for measuring and forcing turbulence at its smallest scale. The interplay between the magnetic torque, from an externally controllable magnetic field, and hydrodynamic stresses, from small-scale turbulent vorticity, reveals an extremely rich phenomenology. Notably, we present the first observation of stochastic resonance for particles in turbulence: turbulent fluctuations, effectively acting as noise, counterintuitively enhance the particle rotational response to external forcing. We identify a pronounced resonant peak in particle rotational phase-lag when the applied magnetic field matches the characteristic intensity of small-scale vortices. Furthermore, we uncover a novel symmetry-breaking mechanism: an oscillating magnetic field with zero-mean angular velocity remarkably induces net particle rotation in turbulence with zero-mean vorticity, as turbulent fluctuations aid the particle in "surfing" the magnetic field. Our findings offer insights into flexible particle manipulation in complex flows and open up a novel magnetic resonance-based approach for measuring vorticity: magnetic particles as probes emit detectable magnetic fields, enabling turbulence quantification even under optically-inaccessible conditions.

Robust Wave Splitters Based on Scattering Singularities in Complex non-Hermitian Systems

Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall); Chaotic Dynamics (nlin.CD); Optics (physics.optics)
We have discovered specific conditions for generic scattering systems to act as wave splitters that are robust to any change in relative amplitude or phase of an arbitrary injected waveform. Specifically for complex systems with tunable parameters, these conditions for robust splitting (RS) are abundant, and by using multiple tunable parameters the relative amplitude and phase of the output signals can also be tuned. The splitting property of the systems works for all possible input phase differences and amplitude ratios and does not require a particular coherent input signal. We show experimentally that the fixed splitting ratios and output phases at RS conditions are robust to 100 dB of relative power and 2$\pi$ phase changes of the input waves to a complex non-Hermitian two-port system. We also demonstrate that the splitting power ratio can be tuned by multiple orders of magnitude and the RS conditions can be tuned to any desired frequency with suitable tunable perturbations embedded in the system. Although this phenomenon is realized in two-port systems and involves some degree of attenuation, tunable robust splitting can be achieved between any two ports of multiport systems. These results are general to all wave scattering phenomena (electromagnetic, acoustic, etc.) and hold in generic complex scattering systems.

A novel decoupling limit of the membrane is proposed, leading to the $(1+2)$-dimensional classically integrable model originally introduced by Manakov, Zakharov, and Ward. This limit is the large-wrapping regime of a membrane propagating toy background of the form $\mathbb{R}_t \times T^2 \times G$ subject to scaling limit, where $G$ is a Lie group and the geometry is supported by a four-form flux. Such toy backgrounds can arise from consistent eleven-dimensional supergravity solutions, exemplified by the uplift of the pure NSNS AdS$_3 \times$ S$^3 \times$ T$^4$ background. The scaling limit can be interpreted as non- or hyper-relativistic limit.

Binomial maps: stochastically evolving iterated integer maps for finite populations

Subjects:
Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE); Chaotic Dynamics (nlin.CD); Applications (stat.AP)
Many models of population dynamics are formulated as deterministic iterated maps although real populations are stochastic. This is justifiable in the limit of large population sizes, as the stochastic fluctuations are negligible then. However, this also makes it challenging to use the same models for small populations where finite size effects like demographic noise and extinction cannot be ignored. Moreover, adding noise to the equations does not solve this problem as it can only represent the environmental stochasticity. An approach, sometimes used in ecological literature, but surprisingly uncommon in dynamical systems community, is \emph{Binomial maps}, which allow stochastic evolution of deterministic iterated map models of population. Here we present their formulation in a way so as to make their connection to the agent-based models explicit, and demonstrate it for the Logistic and Ricker maps. We also show that the Binomial maps are not completely equivalent to their deterministic counterparts, and derive sufficient conditions under which the equivalence holds. This approach enables rigorous finite-population analysis within familiar map-based models, bridging the deterministic map models and stochastic agent-based models.

Quasi one dimensional anomalous (rogue) waves in multidimensional nonlinear Schrödinger equations 1: fission and fusion
Francesco Coppini, Paolo Maria Santini
Subjects:
Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Pattern Formation and Solitons (nlin.PS)
In this paper we study the first nonlinear stage of modulation instability (NLSMI) of $x$-periodic AWs in multidimensional generalizations of the focusing nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) equation, like the non-integrable elliptic and hyperbolic NLS equations in $2+1$ and $3+1$ dimensions. In the quasi one-dimensional (Q1D) regime, where the wavelength in the $x$ direction of propagation is significantly smaller than in the transversal directions, the behavior is universal, independent of the particular model at leading order, and described by adiabatic deformations of the Akhmediev breather solution of NLS. Varying the initial data, the first NLSMI shows various combinations of basic processes like AW growth from the unstable background, followed by fission in the slowly varying transversal directions, and the inverse process of fusion, followed by AW decay to the background. Fission and fusion are critical processes showing similarities with multidimensional wave breaking, and with phase transitions of second kind and critical exponent $1/2$. In $3+1$ dimensions with radial symmetry in the transversal slowly varying plane, fission consists in the formation of an opening smoke ring centered on the $x$ axis. In the long wave limit, the Q1D Akhmediev breather reduces to the Q1D analogue of the Peregrine instanton, rationally localized in space. Numerical experiments on the hyperbolic NLS equation show that the process of "AW growth + fission" is not restricted to the Q1D regime, extending to a finite area of the modulation instability domain. The universality of these processes suggests their observability in natural phenomena related to AWs in contexts such as water waves, nonlinear optics, and plasma physics.

The formation of coherent structures in developed turbulence can be described as a self-organization process, where macroscopic order emerges from a chaotic background through nonequilibrium phase transitions. We model this mechanism by simulating an ensemble of locally coupled classical oscillators, representing the oscillatory modes of fluctuation within a turbulent medium, which synchronize via a propagating Kuramoto-like interaction field. Upon synchronization, the system spontaneously self-organizes into dense structures, and we demonstrate a tendency for those structures to form quantized loop currents of phase information. These currents are governed by topological constraints that arise from statistical instabilities within the system's oscillatory interaction network. We show that the power spectral density of these emergent structures exhibits a stable, universal power-law behaviour, with spectral indices characteristic of natural plasma turbulence. These findings suggest that the statistical markers of turbulence can arise from universal principles of topological self-organization, independent of the system's specific physical constraints.
