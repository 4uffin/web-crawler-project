Title:
A generalization of the beam problem: Connection to multi-component Camassa-Holm dynamics
Richard Beals, Jacek Szmigielski

20 pages, 5 figures
Subjects:
Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems (nlin.SI); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
We extend the Euler-Bernoulli beam problem, formulated as a matrix string equation with a matrix-valued density, to a setting where the density takes values in a Clifford algebra, and we analyze its isospectral deformations. For discrete densities, we prove that the associated matrix Weyl function admits a Stieltjes-type continued fraction expansion with Clifford-valued coefficients. By mapping the problem from the finite interval to the real line, we uncover a direct link to a multi-component generalization of the Camassa-Holm equation. This yields a vectorized form of the Camassa-Holm equation invariant under arbitrary orthogonal group actions. As an illustration, we examine the dynamics of a two-atom (two-peakon) matrix measure in the special case of a Clifford algebra with two generators and Minkowski signature. Our analysis shows that, even when peakon waves remain spatially separated, they can engage in long-range, synchronized energy exchange.

Title:
Network stochastic resonance under higher-order interactions
Zheng Wang, Jinjie Zhu, Xianbin Liu
Subjects:
Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems (nlin.AO)
Although stochastic resonance phenomena are ubiquitous across various complex systems, the influence mechanisms of higher-order interactions remain elusive. Here, we address this gap by investigating stochastic resonance in coupled phase oscillators with triadic interactions on ring networks that feature periodic modulation of the triadic coupling strength and additive noise. Our analysis reveals that higher-order interactions create fundamentally different resonance landscapes through time-varying potential wells generated by periodic modulation of triadic coupling, enabling novel noise-enhanced processing mechanisms. Additionally, weaker pairwise coupling amplifies resonance effects, while moderate network connectivity appears optimal compared to extensive connections. Our findings establish fundamental principles for network stochastic resonance and provide insights for enhanced signal processing in complex networks.

Title:
Dynamic effects of electric field in hybrid coupling thermosensitive neuronal network
Ediline L. F. Nguessap (1), Antonio C. Roque (1), Fernando F. Ferreira (1) ((1) Department of Physics, FFCLRP, Sao Paulo, Brazil)
Subjects:

The dynamic of thermosensitive neuronal networks under the influence of external electric fields is explored, focusing on hybrid coupling models that incorporate both electrical and chemical synapses. Numerical simulations reveal a variety of complex behaviors, including coherent, incoherent, and chimera states, which are influenced by the frequency of the external field and the cell size. Specificaly chemical coupling is shown to enhances the appearance of a typical chimera states called traveling chimera states, while the external electric field modulates synchronization based on its frequency. Low-frequency fields induce localized synchronization, whereas high-frequency fields exert minimal influence. The study also investigates the role of intrinsic electric fields, represented by cell size, and their effect on both individual neuron activity and network dynamics. These findings enhance the understanding of how external fields control collective neuronal behavior and open up new possibilities for the modulation of neural activity.

Title:

From genomes and ecosystems to bureaucracies and cities, the growth of complex systems occurs by adding new types of functions and expanding existing ones. We present a simple generative model that generalizes the Yule-Simon process by including: (i) a size-dependent probability of introducing new functions, and (ii) a generalized preferential attachment mechanism for expanding existing ones. We uncover a shared underlying structure that helps explain how function diversity evolves in empirical observations, such as prokaryotic proteomes, U.S. federal agencies, and urban economies. We show that real systems are often best represented as having non-Zipfian rank-frequency distributions, driven by sublinear preferential attachment, whilst still maintaining power-law scaling in their abundance distributions. Furthermore, our analytics explain five distinct phases of the organization of functional elements across complex systems. The model integrates empirical findings regarding the logarithmic growth of diversity in cities and the self-similarity of their rank-frequency distributions. Self-similarity previously observed in the rank-frequency distributions of cities is not observed in cells and federal agencies -- however, under a rescaling relative to the total diversity, all systems admit self-similar structures predicted by our theory.

Title:
Unified Framework for Geodesic Dynamics with Conservative, Dissipative, and GUP Effects

Subjects:
General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Chaotic Dynamics (nlin.CD)
We derive generalized geodesic equations in curved spacetime that include conservative forces, dissipative effects, and quantum-gravity-motivated minimal-length corrections. Conservative interactions are incorporated through external vector potentials, while dissipative dynamics arise from an exponential rescaling of the particle Lagrangian. Quantum-gravity effects are introduced via Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) deformed Poisson brackets in the Hamiltonian framework. We show that free-particle geodesics remain unaffected at leading order, but external potentials induce velocity-dependent corrections, implying possible violations of the equivalence principle. As an application, we analyze modified trajectories in Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universes dominated by dust, radiation, stiff matter, and dark energy. Our results establish a unified approach to conservative, dissipative, and GUP-corrected geodesics, providing a framework to probe the interplay between external forces, spacetime curvature, and Planck-scale physics.

Title:
Minimal velocity of the travelling wave solutions in two coupled FKPP equations with the global conservation law
O.I. Baburin, I.S. Burmistrov
Subjects:
Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Pattern Formation and Solitons (nlin.PS)
We investigate the system of two coupled one-dimensional Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov (FKPP) equations which possess the global conservation law. Such system of equations has been recently derived for the quasiparticle densities in the two-band fermionic model with the particle-number conserving dissipative protocol. As standard FKPP equation the studied system of equations has one unstable and one stable homogeneous solution with travelling wave switching between them. We demonstrate that the conservation law enforces the synchronization of travelling waves for both densities and determine their minimal possible velocity. Surprisingly, we find the existence of jumps of the minimal velocity as function of control parameters. We obtain that the minimal velocity of the coupled FKPP equations may significantly exceed the minimal velocity for a single FKPP equation in a wide range of control parameters.

Title:
Chaotic scattering and heating in cold ion-atom collisions: two sides of the same coin
Saajid Chowdhury, Jesús Pérez Ríos

Subjects:
Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph); Chaotic Dynamics (nlin.CD); Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph)
We study the classical dynamics of a Paul-trapped ion in a low-density bath of atoms above 1 $\mu\textrm{K}$. We find that lower energy collisions with more massive atoms, especially at energies less than the initial micromotion heating, are more likely to form atom-ion complexes. These complexes evolve in a fractal structure for every scattering observable, showing non-hyperbolic chaotic dynamics. To explore the chaotic dynamics, we use a GPU-accelerated methodology allowing us to run over $3\times 10^{8}$ trajectories of a $^{174}$Yb$^+$ and different atoms. As a result, after analyzing the dynamics as a function of the atom species, collision energy, trap parameters, and ion-atom potential depth, we find a link between heating and the onset of chaos in the first atom-ion interaction that occurs when a low-density atomic bath is merged with a trapped ion.

Title:
Localized In-Plane Cavity Optomechanics in MEMS
Sasan Rahmanian
Subjects:
Optics (physics.optics); Pattern Formation and Solitons (nlin.PS)
This study demonstrates the realization of localized in-plane optomechanical microcavities embedded within an electrostatic MEMS architecture. The system consists of a curved, clamped-clamped microbeam, fabricated on a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer. A green laser emitted from a Laser Doppler Vibrometer (LDV), is directed perpendicularly onto the device under a vacuum pressure of 7 mTorr, with the beam aligned to fill the gap between the movable microbeam and its adjacent side fixed mirror. This configuration forms localized cavity optomechanical resonators that enable the generation of optomechanical soliton frequency combs through phonon lasing without electrical excitation. The optomechanical resonators' dynamics are examined through experiments and numerical simulations. First, the experimental findings unveil that in electrostatic MEMS structures, the two reflective electrodes positioned to form a capacitive gap can inadvertently form localized cavities. These cavities significantly affect optical readouts, as the photodetected signal encodes contributions from both Doppler-shifted electromagnetic waves and light scattered from the intracavity optical field. This dual contributions can distort mechanical response interpretation unless appropriately filtered. Second, experiments show that optical pumping at various positions along the microbeam induces periodic pulse trains with distinct free spectral ranges (FSRs), each corresponding to different mechanical modes. Our results present the generation of solitary optical wavepackets using in-plane localized Fabry-Pérot microcavities formed within a MEMS device. The results suggest a path toward chip-scale, soliton frequency combs generators featuring frequency spacing on the order of kilohertz, without relying on integrated fiber optics.

Title:
The $r$-matrix structure on the moduli space of framed Higgs pairs
M. Bertola
Comments:
24 pages. Ver 2.: 25 pages. Added relevant bibliography, added examples, typos fixed
Subjects:
Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems (nlin.SI); Symplectic Geometry (math.SG)
On the space of matrices with rational (trigonometric/elliptic) entries there is a well-known Lie-Poisson $r$-matrix structure. The known $r$-matrices are defined on the Riemann sphere (rational), the cylinder (trigonometric), or the torus (elliptic). We extend the formalism to the case of a Riemann surface $\mathcal C$ of higher genus $g$: we consider the moduli space of framed vector bundles of rank $n$ and degree $ng$, where the framing consists in a choice of basis of $n$ independent holomorphic sections chosen to trivialize the fiber at a given point $\infty\in \mathcal C$. The co-tangent space is known to be identified with the set of Higgs fields, i.e., one-forms on $\mathcal C$ with values in the endomorphisms of the vector bundle, with an additional simple pole at $\infty$. The natural symplectic structure on the co-tangent bundle of the moduli space induces a Poisson structure on the Higgs fields. The result is then an explicit $r$--matrix that generalizes the known ones. A detailed discussion of the elliptic case with comparison to the literature is also provided.

Title:
Temporally Non-Uniform Cellular Automata: Surjectivity, Reversibility and Cyclic Behavior
Subrata Paul, Sukanta Das
Subjects:
Formal Languages and Automata Theory (cs.FL); Cellular Automata and Lattice Gases (nlin.CG)
This work studies Temporally Non-Uniform Cellular Automata (t-NUCAs), a variant of non-uniform cellular automata, which temporally use two rules in a sequence during their evolution. The one-dimensional t-NUCAs, under finite as well as infinite lattices, are considered in this work. Surjectivity and injectivity of the t-NUCAs are studied. The reversibility of the t-NUCAs is also explored here. Finally, a study on the cyclic behavior of finite t-NUCAs is presented.

Title:
Radial Basis Function Techniques for Neural Field Models on Surfaces
Sage B Shaw, Zachary P Kilpatrick, Daniele Avitabile
Comments:
25 pages, 8 figures
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA); Pattern Formation and Solitons (nlin.PS); Neurons and Cognition (q-bio.NC)
We present a numerical framework for solving neural field equations on surfaces using Radial Basis Function (RBF) interpolation and quadrature. Neural field models describe the evolution of macroscopic brain activity, but modeling studies often overlook the complex geometry of curved cortical domains. Traditional numerical methods, such as finite element or spectral methods, can be computationally expensive and challenging to implement on irregular domains. In contrast, RBF-based methods provide a flexible alternative by offering interpolation and quadrature schemes that efficiently handle arbitrary geometries with high-order accuracy. We first develop an RBF-based interpolatory projection framework for neural field models on general surfaces. Quadrature for both flat and curved domains are derived in detail, ensuring high-order accuracy and stability as they depend on RBF hyperparameters (basis functions, augmenting polynomials, and stencil size). Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the convergence of our method, highlighting its advantages over traditional approaches in terms of flexibility and accuracy. We conclude with an exposition of numerical simulations of spatiotemporal activity on complex surfaces, illustrating the method's ability to capture complex wave propagation patterns.
