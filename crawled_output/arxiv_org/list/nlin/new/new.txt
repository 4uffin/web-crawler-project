Title:
A multichannel generalization of the HAVOK method for the analysis of nonlinear dynamical systems
Carlos Colchero, Jorge Perez, Alvaro Herrera, Oliver Probst
Subjects:
Chaotic Dynamics (nlin.CD)
By extending Takens' embedding theorem (1981), Deyle and Sugihara (2011) provided a theoretical justification for using parallel measurement time series to reconstruct a system's attractor. Building on Takens' framework, Brunton et al. (2017) introduced the Hankel alternative view of Koopman (HAVOK) algorithm, a data-driven approach capable of linearizing chaotic systems through delay embeddings. In this work, a modified version of the original algorithm is presented (mHAVOK), a practical realization of Deyle and Sugihara's generalized embedding theory. mHAVOK extends the original algorithm from one to multiple input time series and introduces a systematic approach to separating linear and nonlinear terms. An R2-informed quality score is introduced and shown to be a reliable guide for the selection of the reduced rank. The algorithm is tested on the familiar Lorenz system, as well as the more sophisticated Sprott system, which features different behaviors depending on the initial conditions. The quality of the reconstructions is assessed with the Chamfer distance, validating how mHAVOK allows for a more accurate reconstruction of the system dynamics. The new methodology generalizes HAVOK by allowing the analysis of multivariate time series, fundamental in real life data-driven applications.

Title:
The effect of parameter drift in the transport of magnetized plasma particles
P. Haerter, R. L. Viana
Subjects:
Chaotic Dynamics (nlin.CD); Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph)
We investigate how time dependent modulations of drift wave amplitudes affect particle transport and chaos in a magnetized plasma. Using the Horton model, we apply a sawtooth ramp to a primary wave's amplitude and periodic rectangular kicks to secondary waves, simulating a driven system. Particle transport is quantified by the Mean Square Displacement (MSD) exponent, $\alpha$, and chaos by the Maximum Lyapunov Exponent (MLE). Our primary finding is a strong negative correlation between the system's average chaoticity and its transport efficiency. We show that rapid sawtooth ramping (short period $\tau$) produces highly efficient, superdiffusive transport ($\alpha > 1$). In contrast, slower ramping increases the system's chaos but suppresses transport, driving it towards normal diffusion ($\alpha \to 1$). This counter intuitive result demonstrates that heightened chaos destroys the coherent, streamer like structures necessary for superdiffusive flights. Our findings indicate that the coherence of the turbulent field, rather than its raw chaoticity, is the key determinant of transport efficiency, offering a new perspective on plasma control.

Pattern Formation and Solitons (nlin.PS)
Studying wave propagation in nonlinear discrete systems is essential for understanding energy transfer in lattices. While linear systems prohibit wave propagation within the natural band gap, nonlinear systems exhibit {supratransmission}, enabling energy transfer above a critical driving amplitude. This work investigates novel \emph{in-band supratransmissions} for waves with frequencies in a \emph{flat} or \emph{nearly flat} linear band. Flat bands, characterized by zero group velocity and localized modes due to destructive interference, provide an ideal framework for studying wave confinement and energy dynamics. In-band supratransmission originates from a bifurcation of evanescent waves at the flat band frequency. Using nonlinear \emph{diamond} and \emph{stub} lattices as model systems, we explore how lattice topology, nonlinearity, and driving amplitude affect supratransmission. Through bifurcation analysis, stability evaluations, and time-dependent simulations, we examine the transition from energy localization to supratransmission.

Title:
On the geometry of WDVV equations and their Hamiltonian formalism in arbitrary dimension
S. Opanasenko, R. Vitolo
Subjects:
Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems (nlin.SI); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
It is known that in low dimensions WDVV equations can be rewritten as
commuting quasilinear bi-Hamiltonian systems. We extend some of these
results to arbitrary dimension $N$ and arbitrary scalar product $\eta$. In
particular, we show that WDVV equations can be interpreted as a set of linear
line congruences in suitable Plücker embeddings. This form leads to their
representation as Hamiltonian systems of conservation laws. Moreover, we
show that in low dimensions and for an arbitrary $\eta$ WDVV equations can be
reduced to passive orthonomic form. This leads to the commutativity of the
Hamiltonian systems of conservation laws. We conjecture that such a result
holds in all dimensions.

Title:
Anomalous Trajectory Drift and Geometric Phases of Cyclic Spinor Solitons Induced by Virtual Magnetic Monopoles

We investigate the dynamics of a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate with spin-orbit coupling numerically and analytically. Under the drive of a weak segmented rotational external field, we observe that the system exhibits cyclic soliton motion; however, in contrast to the predictions of quasi-particle theory, the trajectory of the soliton center shows a distinct drift. The underlying mechanism of this anomalous drift is revealed: the moving soliton experiences a Lorentz force induced by a virtual magnetic monopole field in momentum space. We further calculate the phase evolution of the soliton during this cyclic motion and find that its geometric component comprises both an adiabatic Berry phase and a nonadiabatic Aharonov-Anandan phase. Notably, the Berry phase can be expressed in terms of the magnetic flux of the aforementioned virtual monopole field. Our findings hold implications for geometric phase theory and experiments on two-component Bose-Einstein condensates, and may establish a novel link between quantum geometry and soliton dynamics.

Oscillating ring ferrodark solitons with breathing nematic core in a homogeneous spinor superfluid

Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Pattern Formation and Solitons (nlin.PS)
We study the dynamics of ring ferrodark solitons (FDSs) in a homogeneous quasi-two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnetic spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). In contrast to the usual expanding dynamics of ring dark solitons in a homogeneous system, the ring FDS radius exhibits self-sustained oscillations accompanied by the nematic tensor breathing at the magnetization-vanishing ring FDS core. When the ring radius greatly exceeds the FDS width, motion is nearly elastic, and we derive the ring-radius equation of motion (EOM) which admits exact solutions. This equation can be recast into a form analogous to the inviscid Rayleigh-Plesset equation governing spherical bubble dynamics in classical fluids, but with anomalous terms. At the ring FDS core, the nematic tensor motion is parameterized by a single parameter that connects the two types of FDSs monotonically. Beyond the hydrodynamics regime, density and spin wave emissions become significant and cause energy loss, shrinking the ring FDS radius oscillation; below a threshold, collapses occur followed by the ring FDS annihilation. In the zero quadratic Zeeman energy limit, the ring radius and eigenvalues of the nematic tensor become stationary, while oscillations of the nematic tensor components, driven by the ring curvature, persist at the core. Excellent agreements are found between analytical predictions and numerical simulations.

Three-dimensional magnetization textures as quaternionic functions

Subjects:
Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall); Pattern Formation and Solitons (nlin.PS)
Thanks to the recent progress in bulk full three-dimensional nanoscale magnetization distribution imaging, there is a growing interest to three-dimensional (3D) magnetization textures, promising new high information density spintronic applications. Compared to 1D domain walls or 2D magnetic vortices/skyrmions, they are a much harder challenge to represent, analyze and reason about. In this Letter we build analytical representation for such a textures (with arbitrary number of singularity-free hopfions and singular Bloch point pairs) as products of simple quaternionic functions. It can be useful as a language for expressing theoretical models of 3D magnetization textures and specifying a variety of topologically non-trivial initial conditions for micromagnetic simulations.

We propose a scheme for driving a dipolar molecular rotor to rotate continuously by applying an external electric field: the dipolar rotor is fixed on a graphene sheet via a metal atom to facilitate the free rotation; it is in the meantime subjected to an electric field oriented parallel to the graphene sheet. We use computational modeling with density functional theory and Newtonian mechanics, similar to molecular dynamics simulations, to obtain the torque, angular velocity, and rotation period of the rotor. Our results show that the dipolar rotor designed here can rotate with a period of 2.96 ps by an alternating rectangular electric field with a strength of 0.5 V/Å. However, a cosine wave alternating electric field depending on time cannot drive the dipolar rotor to rotate regularly. Therefore, a cosine wave electric field depending on the rotation angle is suggested, as it can not only drive the rotor but also produce additional power. Machine learning molecular dynamics (MLMD) simulations further confirm that the rotor remains thermodynamically stable under an electric field. This work reveals the rotation mechanism of a dipolar molecular rotor in a transverse electric field, and we hope this work can open a new path for designing more diverse molecular machines in experiments.

Integrable spin Calogero-Moser type systems with non-symmetric configurations of the singularities of the potential appeared in the work of Chalykh, Goncharenko, and Veselov in 1999. We obtain various generalisations of these examples by making use of the representation theory of Cherednik algebras.

Title:
Stationary reduction method based on nonisospectral deformation of orthogonal polynomials, and discrete Painlevé-type equations

Subjects:
Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems (nlin.SI); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
In this work, we propose a new approach called ``stationary reduction method based on nonisospectral deformation of orthogonal polynomials" for deriving discrete Painlevé-type (d-P-type) equations. We apply this approach to (bi)orthogonal polynomials satisfying ordinary orthogonality, $(1,m)$-biorthogonality, generalized Laurent biorthogonality, Cauchy biorthogonality and partial-skew orthogonality. As a result, several seemingly novel classes of high order d-P-type equations or integrable difference systems with potential relations with new d-P-type equations, along with their particular solutions and respective Lax pairs, are derived. Notably, the derived integrable difference system related to the Cauchy biorthogonality is a stationary reduction of a nonisospectral generalization involving the first two flows of the Toda hierarchy of CKP type. Additionally, the integrable difference system related to the partial-skew orthogonality is associated with the nonisospectral Toda hierarchy of BKP type, and it is found to admit a solution expressed in terms of Pfaffians.

Characterizing and quantifying weak chaos in fractional dynamics

Chaotic Dynamics (nlin.CD)
A particularly intriguing and unique feature of fractional dynamical systems is the cascade of bifurcations type trajectories (CBTT). We examine the CBTTs in a generalized version of the standard map that incorporates the Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative, known as the Riemann-Liouville Fractional Standard Map (RLFSM). We propose a methodology that uses two quantifiers based solely on the system's time series: the Hurst exponent and the recurrence time entropy, for characterizing such dynamics. This approach allows us to effectively characterize the dynamics of the RLFSM, including regions of CBTT and chaotic behavior. Our analysis demonstrates that regions of CBTT are associated with trajectories that exhibit lower values of these quantifiers compared to strong chaotic regions, indicating weakly chaotic dynamics during the CBTTs.

Diffusion in the Inverted Triangular Soft Lorentz Gas

We investigate diffusion in a two-dimensional inverted soft Lorentz gas, where attractive Fermi-type potential wells are arranged in a triangular lattice. This configuration contrasts with earlier studies of soft Lorentz gases involving repulsive scatterers. By systematically varying the gap width and softness of the potential, we explore a rich landscape of diffusive behaviors. We present numerical simulations of the mean squared displacement and compute diffusion coefficients, identifying tongue-like structures in parameter space associated with quasiballistic transport. Furthermore, we develop an extension to the Machta-Zwanzig approximation that incorporates correlated multi-hop trajectories and correct for the influence of localized periodic orbits. Our findings highlight the qualitative and quantitative differences between inverted and repulsive soft Lorentz gases and offer new insights into transport phenomena in smooth periodic potentials.

Title:
Multiple Timescale Dynamics of Network Adaptation with Constraints
Erik Andreas Martens, Christian Bick
Subjects:
Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems (nlin.AO)
Adaptive network dynamical systems describe the co-evolution of dynamical quantities on the nodes as well as dynamics of the network connections themselves. For dense networks of many nodes, the resulting dynamics are typically high-dimensional. Here we consider adaptive dynamical systems subject to constraints on network adaptation: Asymptotically, the adaptive dynamics of network connections evolve on a low-dimensional subset of possible connectivity. Such dimension reduction may be intrinsic to the adaptation rule or arise from an additional dynamical mechanism acting on a timescale distinct from that of network adaptation. We illustrate how network adaptation with various constraints influences the dynamics of Kuramoto oscillator networks and elucidate the role of multiple timescales in shaping the dynamics. Our results shed light on why one may expect effective low-dimensional adaptation dynamics in generally high-dimensional adaptive network dynamical systems.

Title:
Extremal monomial property of q-characters and polynomiality of the X-series

The character of every irreducible finite-dimensional representation of a simple Lie algebra has the highest weight property. The invariance of the character under the action of the Weyl group W implies that there is a similar "extremal weight property" for every weight obtained by applying an element of W to the highest weight. In this paper we conjecture an analogous "extremal monomial property" of the q-characters of simple finite-dimensional modules over the quantum affine algebras, using the braid group action on q-characters defined by Chari. In the case of the identity element of W, this is the highest monomial property of q-characters proved in arXiv:math/9911112. Here we prove it for simple reflections. Somewhat surprisingly, the extremal monomial property for each w in W turns out to be equivalent to polynomiality of the "X-series" corresponding to w, which we introduce in this paper. We show that these X-series are equal to certain limits of the generalized Baxter operators for all w in W. Thus, we find a new bridge between q-characters and the spectra of XXZ-type quantum integrable models associated to quantum affine algebras. This leads us to conjecture polynomiality of all generalized Baxter operators, extending the results of arXiv:1308.3444.

Chemomechanical motility modes of partially wetting liquid droplets

We consider a simple thermodynamically consistent model that captures the self-organized chemomechanical coupling resulting from the interplay between autocatalytically reacting surfactants, the Marangoni effect and wetting dynamics. An ambient bath of surfactant acts as a chemostat and provides the system with chemical fuel, thereby driving it away from thermodynamic equilibrium. We find that a positive feedback loop between the local reactions and the Marangoni effect induces surface tension gradients that allow for self-propelled droplets. Besides simple directional motion, we find crawling and shuttling droplets as well as droplets performing random walks, thus exploring the entire substrate. We study the occurring chemomechanical motility modes and show how the observed dynamic states emerge from local and global bifurcations. Due to the underlying generic thermodynamic structure, we expect that our results are relevant not only to directly related biomimetic droplet systems but also to structurally similar systems like chemically active phase-separating mixtures.

Landau levels of a Dirac electron in graphene from non-uniform magnetic fields

The occurrence of Landau levels in quantum mechanics when a charged particle is subjected to a uniform magnetic field is well known. Considering the recent interest in the electronic properties of graphene, which admits a dispersion relation which is linear in the momentum near the Dirac points, we revisit the problem of Landau levels in the spirit of the Dirac Hamiltonian and ask if there are certain non-uniform magnetic fields which also lead to a spectrum consisting of the Landau levels. The answer, as we show, is in the affirmative. In particular, by considering isospectral deformations of the uniform magnetic field, we present explicit analytical expressions for non-uniform magnetic fields that are strictly isospectral to their uniform counterpart, thus supporting the Landau levels.

Dirac monopole magnets in non-Hermitian systems

We theoretically establish that non-Hermitian perturbations induce a topological transformation of point-like Dirac monopoles into extended monopole distributions, characterized by distinct charge configurations emergent from three distinct Berry connection forms. Using piecewise adiabatic evolution, we confirm the validity of these configurations through observations of complex geometric phases. Most critically, we find a quantitative relation $\Delta \phi_d = \Delta \phi_g$, which quantifies how cumulative minute energy differences (\(\Delta \phi_d\)) manifest as geometric phase shifts (\(\Delta \phi_g\)) uniquely in non-Hermitian systems. We further propose a scheme leveraging soliton dynamics in dissipative two-component Bose-Einstein condensates, enabling direct measurement of these topological signatures. These results establish a milestone for understanding Dirac monopole charge distributions and measuring complex geometric phases in non-Hermitian systems, with far-reaching implications for topological quantum computing and non-Hermitian photonics.
