Title:
Deep Neural Networks can eliminate Spiral-wave Turbulence in Cardiac Tissue Models
Vasanth Kumar Babu, Rahul Pandit
Subjects:
Pattern Formation and Solitons (nlin.PS); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph)
Ventricular arrhythmias, like ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF), precipitate sudden cardiac death (SCD), which is the leading cause of mortality in the industrialised world. Thus, the elimination of VT and VF is a problem of paramount importance, which is studied experimentally, theoretically, and numerically. Numerical studies use partial-differential-equation models, for cardiac tissue, which admit solutions with spiral- or broken-spiral-wave solutions that are the mathematical counterparts of VT and VF. In silico investigations of such mathematical models of cardiac tissue allow us not only to explore the properties of such spiral-wave turbulence, but also to develop mathematical analogues of low-amplitude defibrillation by the application of currents that can eliminate spiral waves. We develop an efficient deep-neural-network U-Net-based method for the control of spiral-wave turbulence in mathematical models of cardiac tissue. Specifically, we use the simple, two-variable Aliev-Panfilov and the ionically realistic TP06 mathematical models to show that the lower the correlation length {\xi} for spiral-turbulence patterns, the easier it is to eliminate them by the application of control currents on a mesh electrode. We then use spiral-turbulence patterns from the TP06 model to train a U-Net to predict the sodium current, which is most prominent along thin lines that track the propagating front of a spiral wave. We apply currents, in the vicinities of the predicted sodium-current lines to eliminate spiral waves efficiently. The amplitudes of these currents are adjusted automatically, so that they are small when {\xi} is large and vice versa. We show that our U-Net-aided elimination of spiral-wave turbulence is superior to earlier methods.

Title:
Generalizing thermodynamic efficiency of interactions: inferential, information-geometric and computational perspectives

Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems (nlin.AO)
Self-organizing systems consume energy to generate internal order. The concept of thermodynamic efficiency, drawing from statistical physics and information theory, has previously been proposed to characterize a change in control parameter by relating the resulting predictability gain to the required amount of work. However, previous studies have taken a system-centric perspective and considered only single control parameters. Here, we generalize thermodynamic efficiency to multi-parameter settings and derive two observer-centric formulations. The first, an inferential form, relates efficiency to fluctuations of macroscopic observables, interpreting thermodynamic efficiency in terms of how well the system parameters can be inferred from observable macroscopic behaviour. The second, an information-geometric form, expresses efficiency in terms of the Fisher information matrix, interpreting it with respect to how difficult it is to navigate the statistical manifold defined by the control protocol. This observer-centric perspective is contrasted with the existing system-centric view, where efficiency is considered an intrinsic property of the system.

Title:
Turing patterns on adaptive networks

We are surrounded by spatio-temporal patterns resulting from the interaction of the numerous basic units constituting natural or human-made systems. In presence of diffusive-like coupling, Turing theory has been largely applied to explain the formation of such self-organized motifs both on continuous domains or networked systems, where reactions occur in the nodes and the available links are used for species to diffuse. In many relevant applications, those links are not static, as very often assumed, but evolve in time and more importantly they adapt their weights to the states of the nodes. In this work, we make one step forward and we provide a general theory to prove the validity of Turing idea in the case of adaptive symmetric networks with positive weights. The conditions for the emergence of Turing instability rely on the spectral property of the Laplace matrix and the model parameters, thus strengthening the interplay between dynamics and network topology. A rich variety of patterns are presented by using two prototype models of nonlinear dynamical systems, the Brusselator and the FitzHugh-Nagumo model. Because many empirical networks adapt to changes in the system states, our results pave the way for a thorough understanding of self-organization in real-world systems.

Chaotic Dynamics (nlin.CD)
We study in detail the form of the orbits in integrable generalized Hénon-Heiles systems with Hamiltonians of the form $H = \frac{1}{2}(\dot{x}^2 + Ax^2 + \dot{y}^2 + By^2) + \epsilon(xy^2 + \alpha x^3).$ In particular, we focus on the invariant curves on Poincaré surfaces of section ($ y = 0$) and the corresponding orbits on the $x-y$ plane. We provide a detailed analysis of the transition from bounded to escaping orbits in each integrable system case, highlighting the mechanism behind the escape to infinity. Then, we investigate the form of the non-escaping orbits, conducting a comparative analysis across various integrable cases and physical parameters.

Title:
Periodic orbits underlying spatiotemporal chaos in the Lugiato-Lefever model

Subjects:
Pattern Formation and Solitons (nlin.PS); Chaotic Dynamics (nlin.CD); Optics (physics.optics)
We obtain and investigate theoretically a broad family of stable and unstable time-periodic orbits-oscillating Turing rolls (OTR)-in the Lugiato-Lefever model of optical cavities. Using the dynamical systems tools developed in fluid dynamics, we access the OTR solution branches in parameter space and elucidate their bifurcation structure. By tracking these exact invariant solutions deeply into the chaotic region of the modulation instability, we connect the main dynamical regimes of the Lugiato-Lefever model: continuous waves, Turing rolls, solitons, and breathers, which completes the classical phase diagram of the optical cavity. We then demonstrate that the OTR periodic orbits play a fundamental role as elementary building blocks in the regime of the intracavity field transition from stable Turing rolls to fully developed turbulent regimes. Depending on the cavity size, we observe that the chaotic intracavity field driven by modulation instability displays either spatiotemporal or purely temporal intermittancy between chaotic dynamics and different families of the OTR solutions, exhibiting locally the distinctive wave patterns and large amplitude peaks. This opens avenues for a theoretical description of optical turbulence within the dynamical systems framework.

Bohmian Chaos and Entanglement in a Two-Qubit System

Subjects:
Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Chaotic Dynamics (nlin.CD)
We study in detail the critical points of Bohmian flow, both in the inertial frame of reference (Y-points) and in the frames centered at the moving nodal points of the guiding wavefunction (X-points), and analyze their role in the onset of chaos in a system of two entangled qubits. We find the distances between these critical points and a moving Bohmian particle at varying levels of entanglement, with particular emphasis on the times at which chaos arises. Then, we find why some trajectories are ordered, without any chaos. Finally, we examine numerically how the Lyapunov Characteristic Number (LCN ) depends on the degree of quantum entanglement. Our results indicate that increasing entanglement reduces the convergence time of the finite-time LCN of the chaotic trajectories toward its final positive value.

Title:
Computational modeling of diffusive dynamics in a bouncer system with an irregular surface
Luiz Antonio Barreiro

10 pages, 7 figures, 3 Tables
Subjects:
Physics Education (physics.ed-ph); Chaotic Dynamics (nlin.CD)
The horizontal dynamics of a bouncing ball interacting with an irregular surface is investigated and is found to demonstrate behavior analogous to a random walk. Its stochastic character is substantiated by the calculation of a permutation entropy. The probability density function associated with the particle positions evolves to a Gaussian distribution, and the second moment follows a power-law dependence on time, indicative of diffusive behavior. The results emphasize that deterministic systems with complex geometries or nonlinearities can generate behavior that is statistically indistinguishable from random. Several problems are suggested to extend the analysis.

Title:
Solitons with Self-induced Topological Nonreciprocity
Pedro Fittipaldi de Castro, Wladimir Alejandro Benalcazar

6 pages, 3 figures
Subjects:
Pattern Formation and Solitons (nlin.PS); Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)
The nonlinear Schrodinger equation supports solitons -- self-interacting, localized states that behave as nearly independent objects. We exhibit solitons with self-induced nonreciprocal dynamics in a discrete nonlinear Schrodinger equation. This nonreciprocal behavior, dependent on soliton power, arises from the interplay between linear and nonlinear terms in the equations of motion. Initially stable at high power, solitons exhibit nonreciprocal instabilities as power decreases, leading to unidirectional acceleration and amplification. This behavior is topologically protected by winding numbers on the solitons' mean-field Hamiltonian and their stability matrix, linking nonlinear dynamics and point gap topology in non-Hermitian Hamiltonians.

Soliton solutions to the Sawada--Kotera equation

Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems (nlin.SI)
We consider the direct and inverse scattering problems for the third-order differential equation in the reflectionless case. We formulate a corresponding Riemann--Hilbert problem using input consisting of the bound-state poles of a transmission coefficient and the bound-state dependency constants. With the time-evolved dependency constants, using the solution to the Riemann--Hilbert problem, we construct soliton solutions to an integrable system of fifth-order nonlinear partial differential equations. By imposing some appropriate restrictions on the dependency constants, we show that those soliton solutions yield soliton solutions to the Sawada--Kotera equation.

Title:
Hierarchy of percolation patterns in a kinetic replication model

The model of a one-dimensional kinetic contact process with parallel update is studied by the Monte Carlo simulations and finite-size scaling. The goal was to reveal the structure of the hidden percolative patterns (order parameters) in the active phase and the nature of transitions those patterns emerge through. Our results corroborate the earlier conjecture that in general the active (percolating) phases possess the hierarchical structure (tower of percolation patterns), where more complicated patterns emerge on the top of coexistent patterns of lesser complexity. Plethora of different patterns emerge via cascades of continuous transitions. We detect five phases with distinct patterns of percolation within the active phase of the model. All transitions on the phase diagram belong to the directed percolation universality class, as confirmed by the scaling analysis. To accommodate the case of multiple percolating phases the extension of the Janssen-Grassberger conjecture is proposed.

Title:
Synergistic Motifs in Gaussian Systems
Enrico Caprioglio, Pedro A. M. Mediano, Luc Berthouze
Subjects:
Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph); Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems (nlin.AO)
High-order interdependencies are central features of complex systems, yet a mechanistic explanation for their emergence remains elusive. Currently, it is unknown under what conditions high-order interdependencies, quantified by the information-theoretic construct of synergy, arise in systems governed by pairwise interactions. We solve this problem by providing precise sufficient and necessary conditions for when synergy prevails over low-order interdependencies, namely, we prove that antibalanced (highly frustrated) correlational structures in Gaussian systems are sufficient for synergy-dominance and that antibalanced interaction motifs in Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes are necessary for synergy-dominance. We validate the applicability of these analytical insights in Ising, oscillatory, and empirical networks from multiple domains. Our results demonstrate that pairwise interactions can give rise to synergistic information in the absence of explicit high-order mechanisms, and highlight structural balance theory as an instrumental conceptual framework to study high-order interdependencies.

Title:
Detecting Collective Excitations in Self-Gravitating Bose-Einstein Condensates via Faraday Waves

25pages, 7 figures

We propose Faraday waves as a probe for collective excitations in self-gravitating Bose-Einstein condensates (SGBECs), driven by periodic modulation of the $s$-wave scattering length. Linear stability analysis of the driven Gross-Pitaevskii-Newton equations reveals that parametric instability follows a Mathieu-like equation, with Faraday waves emerging resonantly when half the driving frequency matches the collective excitation frequency of the SGBEC. This framework yields a stability phase diagram that maps the competitive interplay between the unstable tongues of parametric resonance and the intrinsic Jeans instability. The diagram reveals that increasing the driving frequency compresses the Jeans-unstable region and allows well-separated parametric resonance tongues to dominate, thereby creating a clear regime for observing Faraday waves. Conversely, lowering the driving frequency expands the domain of Jeans instability, which fragments and overwhelms the parametric resonance structures. We numerically simulate Faraday wave formation and dynamics within the SGBEC, including the effects of dissipation; simulations reveal a characteristic transition from parametric-resonance-driven Faraday waves to gravity-dominated Jeans collapse as the Jeans frequency increases.

Title:
Topological gravity for arbitrary Dyson index
Torsten Weber, Marco Lents, Johannes Dieplinger, Juan Diego Urbina, Klaus Richter
Comments:
63+25 pages, 8 figures; v2: correction of various typos, extension of the discussion of the generalisation to arbitrary Dyson index
Subjects:

We use the well established duality of topological gravity to a double scaled matrix model with the Airy spectral curve to define what we refer to as topological gravity with arbitrary Dyson index $\upbeta$ ($\upbeta$ topological gravity). On the matrix model side this is an interpolation in the Dyson index between the Wigner-Dyson classes, on the gravity side it can be thought of as interpolating between orientable and unorientable manifolds in the gravitational path integral, opening up the possibility to study moduli space volumes of manifolds ``in between''. Using the perturbative loop equations we study correlation functions of this theory and prove several structural properties, having clear implications on the generalised moduli space volumes. Additionally we give a geometric interpretation of these properties using the generalisation to arbitrary Dyson index of the recently found Mirzakhani-like recursion for unorientable surfaces. Using these properties, we investigate whether $\upbeta$-topological gravity is quantum chaotic in the sense of the BGS conjecture. Along the way we answer this question for the last Wigner-Dyson class not studied in the literature, the symplectic one, and establish strong evidence for quantum chaos for this variety of the theory, and thus for all bosonic varieties of topological gravity. For the general $\upbeta$ case we also argue for the case of quantum chaoticity, based on novel constraints we find to be obeyed by genuinely non Wigner-Dyson parts of the moduli space volumes. As for the general $\upbeta$ case the universal behaviour expected from a chaotic system is not known analytically we give first steps how to obtain it, starting with the result of $\upbeta$ topological gravity and comparing then to a numerical evaluation of the universal result.
