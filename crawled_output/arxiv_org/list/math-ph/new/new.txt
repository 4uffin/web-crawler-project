Title:
The Classification of 3+1d Symmetry Enriched Topological Order

We use a 2-categorical version of (de-)equivariantization to classify (3+1)d topological orders with a finite $G$-symmetry. In particular, we argue that (3+1)d fermionic topological order with $G$-symmetry correspond to $\mathbf{2SVect}$-enriched $G$-crossed braided fusion 2-categories. We then show that the categorical data necessary to define these theories agrees with that arising from a fermionic generalization of the Wang-Wen-Witten construction of bosonic topological theories with $G$-symmetry saturating an anomaly. More generally, we also explain how 2-categorical (de-) equivariantization yields a classification of all braided fusion 2-categories.

Title:
Geometric Phase of Stochastic Oscillators

Several definitions of phase have been proposed for stochastic oscillators, among which the mean-return-time phase and the stochastic asymptotic phase have drawn particular attention. Quantitative comparisons between these two definitions have been done in previous studies, but physical interpretations of such a relation are still missing. In this work, we illustrate this relation using the geometric phase, which is an essential concept in both classical and quantum mechanics. We use properties of probability currents and the generalized Doob's h-transform to explain how the geometric phase arises in stochastic oscillators. Such an analogy is also reminiscent of the noise-induced phase shift in oscillatory systems with deterministic perturbation, allowing us to compare the phase responses in deterministic and stochastic oscillators. The resulting framework unifies these distinct phase definitions and reveals that their difference is governed by a geometric drift term analogous to curvature. This interpretation bridges spectral theory, stochastic dynamics, and geometric phase, and provides new insight into how noise reshapes oscillatory behavior. Our results suggest broader applications of geometric-phase concepts to coupled stochastic oscillators and neural models.

Blowup relations and $q$-Painlevé VI

We propose and study blowup relations obeyed by the partition functions of $5d$ $\mathcal{N}=1$ (quiver) SYM theories with $SU(2)$ gauge group and four flavours. By analyzing the Weyl group action on the sets of blowup relations, we identify the integer parameters of a blowup relation with the weights of a corresponding Lie algebra. We also explain how this action of the Weyl group follows from the Weyl group symmetry of the partition function. Finally, we use these relations to derive bilinear relations on the $q$-Painlevé VI tau functions.

A dynamical approach to studying the Lee-Yang zeros for the Potts Model on the Cayley Tree

Let $Z_n(z,t)$ denote the partition function of the $q$-state Potts Model on the rooted binary Cayley tree of depth~$n$. Here, $z = {\rm e}^{-h/T}$ and $t = {\rm e}^{-J/T}$ with $h$ denoting an externally applied magnetic field, $T$ the temperature, and $J$ a coupling constant. One can interpret $z$ as a ``magnetic field-like'' variable and $t$ as a ``temperature-like'' variable. Physical values $h \in \mathbb{R}$, $T > 0$, and $J \in \mathbb{R}$ correspond to $t \in (0,\infty)$ and $z \in (0,\infty)$. For any fixed $t_0 \in (0,\infty)$ and fixed $n \in \mathbb{N}$ we consider the complex zeros of $Z_n(z,t_0)$ and how they accumulate on the ray $(0,\infty)$ of physical values for $z$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$. In the ferromagnetic case ($J > 0$ or equivalently $t \in (0,1)$) these Lee-Yang zeros accumulate to at most one point on $(0,\infty)$ which we describe using explicit formulae. In the antiferromagnetic case $(J < 0$ or equivalently $t \in (1,\infty)$) these Lee-Yang zeros accumulate to finitely many points of $(0,\infty)$, which we again describe with explicit formulae. The same results hold for the unrooted Cayley tree of branching number two.
These results are proved by adapting a renormalization procedure that was previously used in the case of the Ising model on the Cayley Tree by Müller-Hartmann and Zittartz (1974 and 1977), Barata and Marchetti (1997), and Barata and Goldbaum (2001). We then use methods from complex dynamics and, more specifically, the active/passive dichotomy for iteration of a marked point, along with detailed analysis of the renormalization mappings, to prove the main results.

Lie symmetry analysis and similarity reductions for the tempered-fractional Keller Segel system

Subjects:

We perform a Lie symmetry analysis on the tempered-fractional Keller Segel (TFKS) system, a chemo- taxis model incorporating anomalous diffusion. A novel approach is used to handle the nonlocal nature of tempered fractional operators. By deriving the full set of Lie point symmetries and identifying the optimal one-dimensional subalgebras, we reduce the TFKS PDEs to ordinary differential equations (ODEs), yielding new exact solutions. These results offer insights into the long-term behavior and aggregation dynamics of the TFKS model and present a methodology applicable to other tempered fractional differential equations.

The atmospheric structure of gas giants, especially those of Jupiter and Saturn, has been an object of scientific studies for a long time. The measurement of the gravitational fields by the Juno mission for Jupiter and the Cassini mission for Saturn offered new possibilities to study the interior structure of these planets. Accordingly, the reconstruction of the wind velocities from gravitational data on gas giants has been the subject of many research papers over the years, yet the mathematical foundations of this inverse problem and its numerical resolution have not been studied in detail. This article suggests a rigorous mathematical theory for inferring the wind fields of gas giants. In particular, an orthonormal basis is derived which can be associated to models of the gravitational potential and the interior wind velocity field. Moreover, this approach provides the foundations for existing resolution concepts of the inverse problem.

Fusion in the periodic Temperley-Lieb algebra: general definition of a bifunctor

The periodic Temperley-Lieb category consists of connectivity diagrams drawn on a ring with $N$ and $N'$ nodes on the outer and inner boundary, respectively. We consider families of modules, namely sequences of modules $\mathsf{M}(N)$ over the enlarged periodic Temperley-Lieb algebra for varying values of $N$, endowed with an action $\mathsf{M}(N') \to \mathsf{M}(N)$ of the diagrams. Examples of modules that can be organised into families are those arising in the RSOS model and in the XXZ spin-$\frac12$ chain, as well as several others constructed from link states.
We construct a fusion product which outputs a family of modules from any pair of families. Its definition is inspired from connectivity diagrams drawn on a disc with two holes. It is thus defined in a way to describe intermediate states in lattice correlation functions. We prove that this fusion product is a bifunctor, and that it is distributive, commutative, and associative.

Modified rational six vertex model on a rectangular lattice : new formula, homogeneous and thermodynamic limits

Subjects:

We continue the work of Belliard, Pimenta and Slavnov (2024) studying the modified rational six vertex model. We find another formula of the partition function for the inhomogeneous model, in terms of a determinant that mix the modified Izergin one and a Vandermonde one. This expression enables us to compute the partition function in the homogeneous limit for the rectangular lattice, and then to study the thermodynamic limit. It leads to a new result, we obtain the first order of free energy with boundary effects in the thermodynamic limit.

On enumeration of $l$-hypermaps

Subjects:

The $l$-hypermaps, $l\ge2$, which generalize (dual of) ribbon graphs ($l=2$ case), are interesting enumerative objects. In this paper, based on a theorem of Carlet--van de Leur--Posthuma--Shadrin and the matrix-resolvent method, we derive an explicit formula for $k$-point generating series of enumeration of $l$-hypermaps, which generalizes the one obtained in [30] for the $l=2$ case. We also generalize a theorem of Dubrovin [29].

This paper is focused on the development of the notions of canonical and canonoid transformations within the framework of Hamiltonian Mechanics on locally conformal symplectic manifolds. Both, time-independent and time-dependent dynamics are considered. Noether-like theorems relating one-parameter groups of transformations with canonical and noncanonical symmetries, are formulated, proved as well as illustrated with elementary examples.

Higher-derivative Heterotic Kerr-Sen Black Holes

Subjects:

We obtain the four-derivative corrections to the Kerr-Sen solution in heterotic supergravity, which includes the Gibbons-Maeda-Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger solution as a limiting case. In particular, we first embed the Kerr solution into heterotic supergravity and compute the higher-derivative corrections. We then obtain the corrections to the Kerr-Sen solution by performing an $O(2,1)$ boost of the Kerr solution, which, in contrast to the two-derivative case, requires field redefinitions to make the $O(2,1)$ invariance of the action manifest. Finally, we compute the multipole moments and find that they are distinct from those of the Kerr solution at the four-derivative level. We also find that the multipole moments are distinct from those of the Kerr-Newman solution in Einstein-Maxwell theory at the four-derivative level, even for the most general choice of four-derivative corrections. This gives a way to experimentally distinguish traces of string theory in gravitational wave data.

On the compatibility conditions of finite deformations

Comments:

Subjects:
Classical Physics (physics.class-ph); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
This paper examines the intuitive meaning of the Saint--Venant compatibility equation known from the linear theory of deformations. The linearized theory is typically obtained from the relations of finite deformation theory by neglecting higher-order terms. We show how to formulate the compatibility conditions for finite deformations and how the well-known equation for small deformations follows from this formulation.

Subjects:

In this paper, we present a mathematical analysis of time-dependent $N$-body electronic systems and establish mixed regularity for the corresponding wavefunctions. Based on this, we develop sparse grid approximations to reduce computational complexity, including a sparse grid Gaussian-type orbital (GTO) scheme. We validate the approach on the Helium atom (${\rm He}$) and Hydrogen molecule (${\rm H}_2$), showing that sparse grid GTOs offer an efficient alternative to full grid discretizations.

Hermitian vs non-Hermitian quantum thermometry
Anass Hminat, Abdallah Slaoui, Rachid Ahl Laamara, Mourad Telmini
Subjects:
Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
We investigate the dephasing dynamics of a qubit as an effective mechanism for estimating the temperature of its surrounding environment for different symmetrizes. Our approach is fundamentally quantum, leveraging the qubit's susceptibility to decoherence without necessitating thermal equilibrium with the system under study. We also examine how symmetry properties affect the accuracy of information retrieval and the robustness of quantum information storage in such systems, highlighting their potential advantages in mitigating decoherence effects. The optimization of quantum Fisher information is performed with respect to both the interaction duration and the environmental temperature, focusing on Ohmic-like spectral density environments. Furthermore, we explicitly identify the optimal qubit measurement that attains the quantum Cramer-Rao bound for precision. Our findings reveal that optimal estimation arises from a complex interplay between the qubit's dephasing dynamics and the Ohmic characteristics of the environment with a particular focus on non-Hermitian systems that exhibit enhanced resilience to decoherence. Notably, optimal estimation does not occur when the qubit reaches a stationary state nor under conditions of complete dephasing.

Practical Routing and Criticality in Large-Scale Quantum Communication Networks

Subjects:

The efficacy of a communication network hinges upon both its physical architecture and the protocols that are employed within it. In the context of quantum communications, there exists a fundamental rate-loss tradeoff for point-to-point quantum channels such that the rate for distributing entanglement, secret keys, or quantum states decays exponentially with respect to transmission distance. Quantum networks are the solution to overcome point-to-point limitations, but they simultaneously invite a challenging open question: How should quantum networks be designed to effectively and efficiently guarantee high rates? Now that performance and physical topology are inexorably linked, this question is not easy, but the answer is essential for a future quantum internet to be successful. In this work, we offer crucial insight into this open question for complex optical-fiber quantum networks. Using realistic descriptions of quantum networks via random network models and practical end-to-end routing protocols, we reveal critical phenomena associated with large-scale quantum networks. Our work reveals the weaknesses of applying single-path routing protocols within quantum networks, observing an inability to achieve reliable rates over long distances. Adapting novel algorithms for multi-path routing, we employ an efficient and practical multi-path routing algorithm capable of boosting performance while minimizing costly quantum resources.

On the Poisson brackets of hybrid plasma models with kinetic ions and massless electrons

Comments:

Subjects:
Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
We investigate the conditions under which the Jacobi identity holds for a class of recently introduced anti-symmetric brackets for the hybrid plasma models with kinetic ions and massless electrons. In particular, we establish the precise conditions under which the brackets for the vector-potential-based formulations satisfy the Jacobi identity, and demonstrate that these conditions are fulfilled by all physically relevant functionals. Moreover, for the magnetic-field-based formulation, we show that the corresponding anti-symmetric bracket constitutes a Poisson bracket under the divergence-free condition of the magnetic field, and we provide a direct proof of the Jacobi identity. These results are further extended to models incorporating electron entropy as well as more general hybrid kinetic-fluid models.

On the Monotonicity of relative entropy: A Comparative Study of Petz's and Uhlmann's Approaches
Santiago Matheus, Francesco Bottacin, Edoardo Provenzi
Journal-ref:
Entropy 27(9), 954, 2025
Subjects:
Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
We revisit the monotonicity of relative entropy under the action of quantum channels, a foundational result in quantum information theory. Among the several available proofs, we focus on those by Petz and Uhlmann, which we reformulate within a unified, finite-dimensional operator-theoretic framework. In the first part, we examine Petz's strategy, identify a subtle flaw in his original use of Jensen's contractive operator inequality, and point out how it was corrected to restore the validity of his line of reasoning. In the second part, we develop Uhlmann's approach, which is based on interpolations of positive sesquilinear forms and applies automatically also to non-invertible density operators. By comparing these two approaches, we highlight their complementary strengths: Petz's method is more direct and clear, Uhlmann's is more abstract and general. Our treatment aims to clarify the mathematical structure underlying the monotonicity of relative entropy and to make these proofs more accessible to a broader audience interested in both the foundations and the applications of quantum information theory.

A new approach to the bialgebra theory for relative Poisson algebras
Guilai Liu, Chengming Bai
Comments:

It is natural to consider extending the typical construction of relative Poisson algebras from commutative differential algebras to the context of bialgebras. The known bialgebra structures for relative Poisson algebras, namely relative Poisson bialgebras, are equivalent to Manin triples of relative Poisson algebras with respect to the symmetric bilinear forms which are invariant on both the commutative associative and Lie algebras. However, they are not consistent with commutative and cocommutative differential antisymmetric infinitesimal (ASI) bialgebras as the bialgebra structures for commutative differential algebras. Alternatively, with the invariance replaced by the commutative $2$-cocycles on the Lie algebras, the corresponding Manin triples of relative Poisson algebras are proposed, which are shown to be equivalent to certain bialgebra structures, namely relative PCA bialgebras. They serve as another approach to the bialgebra theory for relative Poisson algebras, which can be naturally constructed from commutative and cocommutative differential ASI bialgebras. The notion of the relative PCA Yang-Baxter equation (RPCA-YBE) in a relative PCA algebra is introduced, whose antisymmetric solutions give coboundary relative PCA bialgebras. The notions of $\mathcal{O}$-operators of relative PCA algebras and relative pre-PCA algebras are also introduced to give antisymmetric solutions of the RPCA-YBE.

We quantize D$0$-brane, the simplest representative of the family of supersymmetric Dirichlet p-branes, in its spinor moving frame formulation and analyze its quantum state spectrum. Besides being a preparatory stage for quantization of the complete supersymmetric multiple D$0$-brane (mD$0$) model, which is presently known only in the frame of spinor moving frame formalism, this is interesting as its own: despite the covariant quantization of D=10 D$0$-brane was discussed before, its quantum state spectrum was not analyzed and its field theory, describing that, was not studied.
We show that the quantum state vector of the D$0$-brane is described by an on-shell superfield that collects the fields of the massive counterpart of the linearized type IIA supergravity supermultiplet which can be obtained as massive Kaluza-Klein mode of the dimensional reduction of the eleven dimensional supergravity down to ten dimensions. In conclusion, we briefly discuss a spinor helicity formalism for D$0$-brane which can be used as one of the basic elements for developing type IIA string theory amplitude calculus based on multiparticle generalizations of the on-shell superfields.

Symmetry Groups of Basins of Attraction in Equivariant Dynamical Systems
Xiao Xie
Subjects:
Chaotic Dynamics (nlin.CD); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Dynamical Systems (math.DS)
This paper investigates the symmetry properties of basins of attraction and their boundaries in equivariant dynamical systems. While the symmetry groups of compact attractors are well understood, the corresponding analysis for non-compact basins and their boundaries has remained underdeveloped. We establish a rigorous theoretical framework demonstrating the hierarchical inclusion of a chain of symmetry groups, showing that boundary symmetries can strictly exceed those of attractors and their basins. To determine admissible symmetry groups of basin boundaries, we propose three complementary approaches: (i) thickening transfer, which connects admissibility results from compact attractors to basins; (ii) algebraic constraints, which exploit the closed nature of boundaries to impose structural restrictions; and (iii) connectivity and flow analysis, which analyzes how the system's dynamics permute states. Numerical experiments on the Thomas system confirm these theoretical results, illustrating that cyclic group actions permute basins while preserving their common boundary, whereas central inversion leaves both basins and boundaries invariant. These findings reveal that basin boundaries often exhibit higher symmetry than the attractors they separate, providing new insights into the geometry of multistable systems and suggesting broader applications to physical and biological models where basin structure determines stability and predictability.

Subjects:

We discuss and formalize a topological means by which the initial singularity might be mollified, at the level of the spacetime manifold's structure, in classical cosmological models of a homogeneous expanding universe. The construction, dubbed a "reflective" topological big bang, generalizes Schrodinger's elliptic de Sitter space and is built to be compatible with the standard Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) picture of the large-scale universe, only minimally modifying it via some nontrivial topology at an earliest "moment" in the universe's history. We establish a mathematical characterization of the admissible topological structures of reflective topological big bangs, and we discuss implications for a standard concern in cosmology, the horizon problem. We present a nonreflective example that we've christened the Itty-Bitty Blender spacetime: this spacetime and its universal cover, the Eternal Trumpet spacetime, exhibit interesting potential structures of spacetimes avoiding the Hawking and Penrose singularity theorems.

Poincar{é} series for analytic convex bodies

Subjects:
Differential Geometry (math.DG); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Spectral Theory (math.SP)
We study Poincar{é} series associated to strictly convex bodies in the Euclidean space. These series are Laplace transforms of the distribution of lengths (measured with the Finsler metric associated to one of the bodies) from one convex body to a lattice. Assuming that the convex bodies have analytic boundaries, we prove that the Poincar{é} series, originally defined in the right complex half-plane, continues holomorphically to a conical neighborhood of this set, removing a countable set of cuts and points. The latter correspond to the spectrum of a dual elliptic operator. We describe singularities of the Poincar{é} series at each of these branching points. One of the steps of the proof consists in showing analytic continuation of the resolvent of multiplication operators by a real-valued analytic Morse function on the sphere as a branched holomorphic function, a result of independent interest.

Exact single-time and two-time correlations and the two-time response function are found for the order-parameter in the voter model with nearest-neighbour interactions. Their explicit dynamical scaling functions are shown to be continuous functions of the space dimension $d>0$. Their form reproduces the predictions of non-equilibrium representations of the Schrödinger algebra for models with dynamical exponent $\mathpzc{z}=2$ and with the dominant noise-source coming from the heat bath. Hence the ageing in the voter model is a paradigm for relaxations in non-equilibrium critical dynamics, without detailed balance, and with the upper critical dimension $d^*=2$.

Quantum instruments are mathematical devices introduced to describe the conditional state change during a quantum process. They are completely positive map valued measures on measurable spaces. We may also view them as non-commutative analogues of joint probability measures. We analyze the $C^*$-convexity structure of spaces of quantum instruments. A complete description of the $C^*$-extreme instruments in finite dimensions has been established. Further, the implications of $C^*$-extremity between quantum instruments and their marginals has been explored.

In this work, we investigate new solutions to the decoration transformation in terms of various special functions, including the hyperbolic gamma function, the basic hypergeometric function, and the Euler gamma function. These solutions to the symmetry transformation are important to decorate Ising-like integrable lattice spin models obtained via the gauge/YBE correspondence. The integral identities represented as the solution of the decoration transformation are derived from the three-dimensional partition functions and superconformal index for the dual supersymmetric gauge theories.

We provide non-asymptotic error bounds in the path Wasserstein distance with quadratic integral cost between suitable functionals of the telegraph process and the corresponding functional of Brownian motion with explicit diffusivity constant. These results cover, in particular, the well-known example of the exponential integral functional of the geometric Brownian motion. The non-asymptotic error bounds tend to zero in the so-called Kac regime. Moreover, the error bounds remain valid when the flip rate for the telegraph process is small. We assess the sharpness of the error bounds through numerical experiments.

We compare the notions of metric-compatibility and torsion of a connection in the frameworks of Beggs-Majid and Mesland-Rennie. It follows that for $\ast$-preserving connections, compatibility with a real metric in the sense of Beggs-Majid corresponds to Hermitian connections in the sense of Mesland-Rennie. If the calculus is quasi-tame, the torsion zero conditions are equivalent. A combination of these results proves the existence and uniqueness of Levi-Civita connections in the sense of Mesland-Rennie for unitary cocycle deformations of a large class of Riemannian manifolds as well as the Heckenberger-Kolb calculi on all quantized irreducible flag manifolds.

Patrik Knopf, Jonas Stange
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
We derive and analyze a new diffuse interface model for incompressible, viscous fluid mixtures with bulk-surface interaction. Our system consists of a Navier--Stokes--Cahn--Hilliard model in the bulk that is coupled to a surface Navier--Stokes--Cahn--Hilliard model on the boundary. Compared with previous models, the inclusion of an additional surface Navier--Stokes equation is motivated, for example, by biological applications such as the seminal \textit{fluid mosaic model} (Singer \& Nicolson, \textit{Science}, 1972) in which the surface of biological cells is interpreted as a thin layer of viscous fluids. We derive our new model by means of local mass balance laws, local energy dissipation laws, and the Lagrange multiplier approach. Moreover, we prove the existence of global weak solutions via a semi-Galerkin discretization. The core part of the mathematical analysis is the study of a novel bulk-surface Stokes system and its corresponding bulk-surface Stokes operator. Its eigenfunctions are used as the Galerkin basis to discretize the bulk-surface Navier--Stokes subsystem.

A key challenge in quantum complexity is how entanglement structure emerges from dynamics, highlighted by advances in simulators and information processing. The Lieb--Robinson bound sets a locality-based speed limit on information propagation, while the Small-Incremental-Entangling (SIE) theorem gives a universal constraint on entanglement growth. Yet, SIE bounds only total entanglement, leaving open the fine entanglement structure. In this work, we introduce Spectral-Entangling Strength, measuring the structural entangling power of an operator, and prove a Spectral SIE theorem: a universal limit for Rényi entanglement growth at $\alpha \ge 1/2$, revealing a robust $1/s^2$ tail in the entanglement spectrum. At $\alpha=1/2$ the bound is qualitatively and quantitatively optimal, identifying the universal threshold beyond which growth is unbounded. This exposes the detailed structure of Schmidt coefficients, enabling rigorous truncation-based error control and linking entanglement to computational complexity. Our framework further establishes a generalized entanglement area law under adiabatic paths, extending a central principle of many-body physics to general interactions. Practically, we show that 1D long-range interacting systems admit polynomial bond-dimension approximations for ground, time-evolved, and thermal states. This closes the quasi-polynomial gap and proves such systems are simulable with polynomial complexity comparable to short-range models. By controlling Rényi entanglement, we also derive the first rigorous precision-guarantee bound for the time-dependent density-matrix-renormalization-group algorithm. Overall, our results extend SIE and provide a unified framework that reveals the detailed structure of quantum complexity.

We study asymptotics of the $d=4$, $\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal index for toric quiver gauge theories. Using graph-theoretic and algebraic factorization techniques, we obtain a cycle expansion for the large-$N$ index in terms of the $R$-charge-weighted adjacency matrix. Applying saddle-point techniques at the on-shell $R$-charges, we determine the asymptotic degeneracy in the univariate specialization for $\hat{A}_{m}$, and along the main diagonal for the bivariate index for $\mathcal{N}=4$ and $\hat{A}_{3}$. In these cases we find $\ln |c_{n}| \sim \gamma n^{\frac{1}{2}}+ \beta \ln n + \alpha$ (Hardy-Ramanujan type). We also identify polynomial growth for $dP3$, $Y^{3,3}$ and $Y^{p,0}$, and give numerical evidence for $\gamma$ in further $Y^{p,p}$ examples. Finally, we generalize Murthy's giant graviton expansion via the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation and Borodin-Okounkov formula to multi-matrix models relevant for quivers.

We construct generalized symmetries in two-dimensional symmetric product orbifold CFTs $\text{Sym}^N(\mathcal{T}),$ for a generic seed CFT $\mathcal{T}$. These symmetries are more general than the universal and maximally symmetric ones previously constructed. We show that, up to one fine-tuned example when the number of copies $N$ equals four, the only symmetries that can be preserved under twisted sector marginal deformations are invertible and maximally symmetric. The results are obtained in two ways. First, using the mathematical machinery of $G$-equivariantization of fusion categories, and second, via the projector construction of topological defect lines. As an application, we classify all preserved symmetries in symmetric product orbifold CFTs with the seed CFT given by any $A$-series $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ minimal model. We comment on the implications of our results for holography.

We give a novel combinatorial interpretation to the perturbative series solutions for a class of Dyson-Schwinger equations. We show how binary tubings of rooted trees with labels from an alphabet on the tubes, and where the labels satisfy certain compatibility constraints, can be used to give series solutions to Dyson-Schwinger equations with a single Mellin transform which is the reciprocal of a polynomial with rational roots, in a fully combinatorial way. Further, the structure of these tubings leads directly to systems of differential equations for the anomalous dimension that are ideally suited for resurgent analysis. We give a general result in the distinct root case, and investigate the effect of repeated roots, which drastically changes the asymptotics and the transseries structure.

The winding number is the topological invariant that classifies chiral symmetric Hamiltonians with one-dimensional parametric dependence. In this work we complete our study of the winding number statistics in a random matrix model belonging to the chiral unitary class AIII. We show that in the limit of large matrix dimensions the winding number distribution becomes Gaussian. Our results include expressions for the statistical moments of the winding number and for the k-point correlation function of the winding number density.

Solution to SU(n+1) Toda system generated by spherical metrics

Subjects:

Using the correspondence between solutions to the SU(n+1) Toda system on a Riemann surface and totally unramified unitary curves, we show that a spherical metric $\omega$ generates a family of solutions, including $(i(n+1-i)\omega)_{i=1}^n$. Moreover, we characterize this family in terms of the monodromy group of the spherical metric. As a consequence, we obtain a new solution class to the SU(n+1) Toda system with cone singularities on compact Riemann surfaces, complementing the existence results of Lin-Yang-Zhong (JDG, 114(2):337-391, 2020).

Quasi one dimensional anomalous (rogue) waves in multidimensional nonlinear Schrödinger equations 1: fission and fusion
Francesco Coppini, Paolo Maria Santini
Subjects:
Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Pattern Formation and Solitons (nlin.PS)
In this paper we study the first nonlinear stage of modulation instability (NLSMI) of $x$-periodic AWs in multidimensional generalizations of the focusing nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) equation, like the non-integrable elliptic and hyperbolic NLS equations in $2+1$ and $3+1$ dimensions. In the quasi one-dimensional (Q1D) regime, where the wavelength in the $x$ direction of propagation is significantly smaller than in the transversal directions, the behavior is universal, independent of the particular model at leading order, and described by adiabatic deformations of the Akhmediev breather solution of NLS. Varying the initial data, the first NLSMI shows various combinations of basic processes like AW growth from the unstable background, followed by fission in the slowly varying transversal directions, and the inverse process of fusion, followed by AW decay to the background. Fission and fusion are critical processes showing similarities with multidimensional wave breaking, and with phase transitions of second kind and critical exponent $1/2$. In $3+1$ dimensions with radial symmetry in the transversal slowly varying plane, fission consists in the formation of an opening smoke ring centered on the $x$ axis. In the long wave limit, the Q1D Akhmediev breather reduces to the Q1D analogue of the Peregrine instanton, rationally localized in space. Numerical experiments on the hyperbolic NLS equation show that the process of "AW growth + fission" is not restricted to the Q1D regime, extending to a finite area of the modulation instability domain. The universality of these processes suggests their observability in natural phenomena related to AWs in contexts such as water waves, nonlinear optics, and plasma physics.

Spectral Broadening of Landau Levels by a Penetrable Circular Wall
Masahiro Kaminaga

Subjects:
Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
We study the two--dimensional magnetic Schrödinger operator with a penetrable circular wall modeled by a $\delta$--interaction. Using the boundary triple approach we classify all self--adjoint extensions and obtain Krein's resolvent formula, showing that the essential spectrum coincides with the Landau levels. The wall breaks their infinite degeneracy and produces a spectral broadening: each Landau level becomes an accumulation point of discrete eigenvalues from one side. In the circular case, rotational symmetry reduces the eigenvalue problem to scalar equations with explicit Weyl coefficients. We prove strict monotonicity, ensuring that each angular momentum channel contributes at most one eigenvalue per gap, and derive asymptotics showing that the boundary coefficients decay faster than any exponential, explaining the strong localization of the broadened spectrum. Numerical simulations are consistent with these results.

Let $M$ be a Riemannian manifold. For $p$ in $M$, the tensor algebra of the negative part of the (complex) affinization of the tangent space of $M$ at $p$ has a natural structure of a meromorphic open-string vertex algebra. These meromorphic open-string vertex algebras form a vector bundle over $M$ with a connection. We construct a sheaf $\mathcal{V}$ of meromorphic open-string vertex algebras on the sheaf of parallel sections of this vector bundle. Using covariant derivatives, we construct representations on the spaces of complex smooth functions of the algebras of parallel tensor fields. These representations are used to construct a sheaf $\mathcal{W}$ of left $\mathcal{V}$-modules generated by the sheaf of smooth functions. In particular, we obtain a meromorphic open-string vertex algebra $V_{M}$ of the global sections on M of the sheaf $\mathcal{V}$ and a left $V_{M}$-module $W_{M}$ of the global sections on M of the sheaf $\mathcal{W}$. By the definitions of meromorphic open-string vertex algebra and left module, we obtain, among many other properties, operator product expansion for vertex operators. We also show that the Laplacian on M is in fact a component of a vertex operator for the left $V_{M}$-module $W_{M}$ restricted to the space of smooth functions.

Gaussian fluctuations for spin systems and point processes: near-optimal rates via quantitative Marcinkiewicz's theorem

We establish asymptotically Gaussian fluctuations for functionals of a large class of spin models and strongly correlated random point fields, achieving near-optimal rates. For spin models, we demonstrate Gaussian asymptotics for the magnetization for a wide class of ferromagnetic spin systems on Euclidean lattices, in particular those with continuous spins. Specific applications include, in particular, the celebrated XY and Heisenberg models under ferromagnetic conditions, and more broadly, systems with very general rotationally invariant spins in arbitrary dimensions. We address both the setting of free boundary conditions and a large class of ferromagnetic boundary conditions, and our CLTs are endowed with near-optimal rate. Our approach leverages the classical Lee-Yang theory for the zeros of partition functions, and subsumes as a special case results of Lebowitz, Ruelle, Pittel and Speer on CLTs in discrete statistical mechanical models for which we obtain sharper convergence rates. In a different direction, we obtain CLTs for linear statistics of a wide class of point processes known as $\alpha$-determinantal point processes which interpolate between negatively and positively associated random point fields. We contribute a unified approach to CLTs in such models; significantly, our approach is able to analyse such processes in dimensions $\ge 3$, where structural alternatives such as connections to random matrix theory are not available. A key ingredient of our approach is a broad, quantitative extension of the classical Marcinkiewicz Theorem that holds under the limited condition that the characteristic function is non-vanishing only on a bounded disk. In spite of the general applicability of the results, our rates for the CLT match the classic Berry-Esseen bounds for independent sums up to a log factor.

Relevant physical phenomena are described by nonlinear Schrödinger equations with non-vanishing conditions at infinity. This paper investigates the respective 2D and 3D Cauchy problems. Local well-posedness in the energy space for energy-subcritical nonlinearities, merely satisfying Kato-type assumptions, is proven, providing the analogue of the well-established local $H^1$-theory for solutions vanishing at infinity. The critical nonlinearity will be simply a byproduct of our analysis and the existing literature. Under an assumption that prevents the onset of a Benjamin-Feir type instability, global well-posedness in the energy space is proven for a) non-negative Hamiltonians, b) sign-indefinite Hamiltonians under additional assumptions on the zeros of the nonlinearity, c) generic nonlinearities and small initial data. The cases b) and c) only concern the 3D case

Edge universality of sparse Erdős-Rényi digraphs

Probability (math.PR); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
Let $\mathcal A$ be the adjacency matrix of the Erdős-Rényi directed graph $\mathscr G(N,p)$. We denote the eigenvalues of $\mathcal A$ by $\lambda_1^{\cal A},...,\lambda^{\cal A}_N$, and $|\lambda_1^{\cal A}|=\max_i|\lambda_i^{\cal A}|$. For $N^{-1+o(1)}\leq p\leq 1/2$, we show that \[ \max_{i=2,3,...,N} \bigg|\frac{\lambda_i^{\mathcal A}}{\sqrt{Np(1-p)}}\bigg| =1+O(N^{-1/2+o(1)}) \] with very high probability. In addition, we prove that near the unit circle, the local eigenvalue statistics of ${\mathcal A}/\sqrt{Np(1-p)}$ coincide with those of the real Ginibre ensemble. As a by-product, we also show that all non-trivial eigenvectors of $\mathcal A$ are completely delocalized.
For Hermitian random matrices, it is known that the edge statistics are sensitive to the sparsity: in the very sparse regime, one needs to remove many noise random variables (which affect both the mean and the fluctuation) to recover the Tracy-Widom distribution. Our results imply that, compared to their analogues in the Hermitian case, the edge statistics of non-Hermitian sparse random matrices are more robust.

Drawing inspiration from Yang-Mills theory and employing the framework of fiber bundle theory, we propose a new gauge-invariant symmetry-reduction approach. Using this method, we successfully identify a cosmological sector of General Relativity in terms of Ashtekar variables that preserves the SU(2) structure of the theory as well as part of the diffeomorphism gauge symmetry. Additionally, we analyze the properties of cylindrical functions and the classical constraint algebra, revealing that certain cylindrical functions exhibit distinctive symmetry features.

We introduce twisted quantum $K$-rings, defined via twisted $K$-theoretic Gromov-Witten invariants. We develop a toolkit for computing relations by adapting some results about ordinary quantum K rings to our setting, and discuss some applications, including Ruan-Zhang's quantum $K$-theory with level structure, and complete intersections inside projective space, confirming some predictions coming from physics.
In addition, we formulate a ring-theoretic abelian/non-abelian correspondence conjecture, relating the quantum K-ring of a GIT quotient $X//G$ to a certain twist of the quantum K-ring of $X//T$, the quotient by the maximal torus. We prove this conjecture for the case of Grassmanians, and use this to give another proof of the Whitney relations of Mihalcea-Gu-Sharpe-Zhou in that case.

Quantum low-density parity-check codes, such as the Kitaev toric code and bivariate bicycle codes, are often defined with periodic boundary conditions, which are difficult to realize in physical systems. In this paper, we present an algorithm for constructing all gapped boundaries and defects of two-dimensional Pauli stabilizer codes. Using the operator algebra formalism, we establish a one-to-one correspondence between the topological data, such as anyon fusion rules and topological spins, of two-dimensional bulk stabilizer codes and one-dimensional boundary anomalous subsystem codes. To make the operator algebra computationally accessible, we adapt Laurent polynomials and convert the tasks into matrix operations, e.g., the Hermite normal form for obtaining boundary anyons and the Smith normal form for determining fusion rules. This approach enables computers to automatically generate all possible gapped boundaries and defects for topological Pauli stabilizer codes through boundary anyon condensation and topological order completion. This streamlines the analysis of surface codes and associated logical operations for fault-tolerant quantum computation. Our algorithm applies to $\mathbb{Z}_d$ qudits for both prime and nonprime $d$, enabling exploration of topological phases beyond the Kitaev toric code. We have applied the algorithm and explicitly demonstrated the lattice constructions of 2 boundaries and 6 defects in the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ toric code, 3 boundaries and 22 defects in the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ toric code, 1 boundary and 2 defects in the double semion code, 1 boundary and 22 defects in the six-semion code, 6 boundaries and 270 defects in the color code, and 6 defects in the anomalous three-fermion code. Finally, we study the boundaries of bivariate bicycle codes, showing that they exhibit large logical dimensions and anyons with long translation periods.

We investigate a class of line ensembles whose local structure is described by independent geometric random walk bridges, which have been conditioned to interlace with each other. The latter arise naturally in the context Schur processes, including their versions in a half-space and a finite interval with free or periodic boundary conditions. We show that under one-point tightness of the curves, these line ensembles are tight and any subsequential limit satisfies the Brownian Gibbs property. As an application of our tightness results, we show that sequences of spiked Schur processes, that were recently considered in arXiv:2408.08445, converge uniformly over compact sets to the Airy wanderer line ensembles.

We provide theory, algorithms, and simulations of non-equilibrium quantum systems using a one-dimensional (1D) completely-positive (CP), matrix-product (MP) density-operator ($\rho$) representation. By generalizing the matrix product state's orthogonality center, to additionally store positive classical mixture correlations, the MP$\rho$ factorization naturally emerges. In this work we analytically and numerically examine the virtual freedoms associated with the representation of quantum density operators. Using this augmented perspective, we simplify algorithms in certain limits to integrate the canonical form's master equation dynamics. This enables us to quickly evolve under the dynamics of two-body quantum channels without resorting to optimization-based methods. In addition to this technical advance, we also scale-up numerical examples and discuss implications for accurately modeling hardware architectures and predicting their performance. This includes an example of the quantum to classical transition of informationally leaky, i.e., decohering, qubits. In this setting, due to loss from environmental interactions, non-local complex coherence correlations are converted into global incoherent classical statistical mixture correlations. Lastly, the representation of both global and local correlations is discussed. We expect this work to have applications in additional non-equilibrium settings, beyond qubit engineering.

We consider the preparation of all the eigenstates of spin chains using quantum circuits. It is known that generic eigenstates of free-fermionic spin chains can be prepared with circuits whose depth grows only polynomially with the length of the chain and the number of particles. We show that the polynomial growth is also achievable for selected interacting models where the interaction between the particles is sufficiently simple. Our working example is the folded XXZ model, an integrable spin chain that exhibits Hilbert space fragmentation. We present the explicit quantum circuits that prepare arbitrary eigenstates of this model on an open chain efficiently. We perform error-mitigated noisy simulations with circuits of up to 13 qubits and different connectivities between qubits, achieving a relative error below 5%. As a byproduct, we extend a recent reformulation of the Bethe ansatz as a quantum circuit from closed to open boundary conditions.

Consistent deformations in the presymplectic BV-AKSZ approach
Jordi Frias, Maxim Grigoriev
Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
We develop a framework for studying consistent interactions of local gauge theories, which is based on the presymplectic BV-AKSZ formulation. The advantage of the proposed approach is that it operates in terms of finite-dimensional spaces and avoids working with quotient spaces such as local functionals or functionals modulo on-shell trivial ones. The structure that is being deformed is that of a presymplectic gauge PDE, which consists of a graded presymplectic structure and a compatible odd vector field. These are known to encode the Batalin--Vilkovisky (BV) formulation of a local gauge theory in terms of the finite dimensional supergeometrical object. Although in its present version the method is limited to interactions that do not deform the presymplectic structure and relies on some natural assumptions, it gives a remarkably simple way to analyse consistent interactions. The approach can be considered as the BV-AKSZ extension of the frame-like approach to consistent interactions. We also describe the underlying homological deformation theory, which turns out to be slightly unusual compared to the standard deformations of differential graded Lie algebras. As an illustration, the Chern-Simons and YM theories are rederived starting from their linearized versions.

We identify all pure KD-positive states and all KD-real observables for these KD representations. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition ensuring that all KD-positive states are convex combinations of pure KD-positive states. We prove that for $G=\Z_{d}$, with $d$ a prime power, this condition is satisfied. We provide examples of abelian groups where it is not. In those cases, the convex set of KD-positive states contains states outside the convex hull of the pure KD-positive states.

Hawking radiation and black hole thermodynamics are well understood in the frameworks of quantum field theory and general relativity, with contemporary extensions in string theory, AdS/CFT, and loop quantum gravity. However, an open question remains: Can Hawking radiation be consistently described using statistical mechanics? This challenge arises due to the ambiguous quantum nature of Hawking particles and constraints imposed by information conservation. This study develops a heuristic statistical model using a worldine Lagrangian formalism, treating Hawking particles as timelike with an effective mass and following an arbitrary statistical distribution. The flow of information is modeled as a transfer of microstates from the event horizon to the radiation background within a closed ensemble. From this framework, the Hawking particle mass $m_H=\hbar/(2\pi r_S)$ is recovered, and the worldline Lagrangian yields the black hole's thermal energy, $E=\hbar/(8\pi GM)$. Beyond preserving conventional insights, reinforcing the statistical nature of black hole evaporation, this approach introduces novel perspectives: modeling the black hole as a structured energy well containing microstates, quantifying the evaporation rate of individual microstates, and determining the total number of microstates from the horizon's surface area. This study leaves the door open for a stochastic mechanical analysis, which is introduced in the Discussion section.

We consider the Wigner minor process, i.e. the eigenvalues of an $N\times N$ Wigner matrix $H^{(N)}$ together with the eigenvalues of all its $n\times n$ minors, $H^{(n)}$, $n\le N$. The top eigenvalues of $H^{(N)}$ and those of its immediate minor $H^{(N-1)}$ are very strongly correlated, but this correlation becomes weaker for smaller minors $H^{(N-k)}$ as $k$ increases. For the GUE minor process the critical transition regime around $k\sim N^{2/3}$ was analyzed by Forrester and Nagao (J. Stat. Mech.: Theory and Experiment, 2011) providing an explicit formula for the nontrivial joint correlation function. We prove that this formula is universal, i.e. it holds for the Wigner minor process. Moreover, we give a complete analysis of the sub- and supercritical regimes both for eigenvalues and for the corresponding eigenvector overlaps, thus we prove the decorrelation transition in full generality.

Title:
Feynman integrals at large loop order and the $\log$-$Γ$ distribution

We find empirically that the value of Feynman integrals follows a $\log$-$\Gamma$ distribution at large loop order. This result opens up a new avenue towards the large-order behavior in perturbative quantum field theory. Our study of the primitive contribution to the scalar $\phi^4$ beta function in four dimensions up to 17 loops provides accompanying evidence. Guided by instanton considerations, we discuss the extrapolation of this contribution to all loop orders.

We consider unitary cocycle deformations of covariant $\ast$-differential calculi. We prove that complex structures, holomorphic bimodules and Chern connections on the deformed calculus are twists of their untwisted counterparts. Moreover, for cocycle deformations of a class of classical Kähler manifolds, the Levi-Civita connection on the space of one forms of the deformed calculus is shown to be a direct sum of the Chern connections on the twisted holomorphic and the anti-holomorphic bimodules. Our class of examples also include cocycle deformations of the Heckenberger-Kolb calculi.

We introduce an algorithm that samples a set of loop momenta distributed as a given Feynman integrand. The algorithm uses the tropical sampling method and can be applied to evaluate phase-space-type integrals efficiently. We provide an implementation, momtrop, and apply it to a series of relevant integrals from the loop-tree duality framework. Compared to naive sampling methods, we observe convergence speedups by factors of more than $10^6$.

The real part of the focusing modified Korteweg-de Vries (MKdV) equation defined over the complex field $\mathbb{C}$ is reduced to the focusing gauged MKdV (FGMKdV) equation. In this paper, we construct the real hyperelliptic solutions of FGMKdV equation in terms of data of the hyperelliptic curves of genus $g$ and demonstrate the closed hyperelliptic plane curves of genus $g=5$ whose curvature obeys the FGMKdV equation by extending the previous results of genus three (Matsutani, {\it{J. Geom. Phys}} {\bf{215}} (2025) 105540). These are a generalization of Euler's elasticae.

Gapped Boundaries of Kitaev's Quantum Double Models: A Lattice Realization of Anyon Condensation from Lagrangian Algebras

The macroscopic theory of anyon condensation, rooted in the categorical structure of topological excitations, provides a complete classification of gapped boundaries in topologically ordered systems, where distinct boundaries correspond to the condensation of different Lagrangian algebras. However, an intrinsic and direct understanding of anyon condensation in lattice models, grounded in the framework of Lagrangian algebras, remains undeveloped. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework for constructing all gapped boundaries of Kitaev's quantum double models directly from the data of Lagrangian algebras. Central to our approach is the observation that bulk interactions in the quantum double models admit two complementary interpretations: the anyon-creating picture and the anyon-probing picture. Generalizing this insight to the boundary, we derive the consistency condition for boundary ribbon operators that respect the mathematical axiomatic structure of Lagrangian algebras. Solving these conditions yields explicit expressions for the local boundary interactions required to realize gapped boundaries. We also provide three families of solutions that cover a broad range of cases. Our construction provides a microscopic characterization of the bulk-to-boundary anyon condensation dynamics via the action of ribbon operators. Moreover, all these boundary terms are supported within a common effective Hilbert space, making further studies on pure boundary phase transitions natural and convenient. Given the broad applicability of anyon condensation theory, we believe that our approach can be generalized to planar topological codes, extended string-net models, or higher-dimensional topologically ordered systems.

The Manakov-Zakharov-Ward model as an integrable decoupling limit of the membrane

A novel decoupling limit of the membrane is proposed, leading to the $(1+2)$-dimensional classically integrable model originally introduced by Manakov, Zakharov, and Ward. This limit is the large-wrapping regime of a membrane propagating toy background of the form $\mathbb{R}_t \times T^2 \times G$ subject to scaling limit, where $G$ is a Lie group and the geometry is supported by a four-form flux. Such toy backgrounds can arise from consistent eleven-dimensional supergravity solutions, exemplified by the uplift of the pure NSNS AdS$_3 \times$ S$^3 \times$ T$^4$ background. The scaling limit can be interpreted as non- or hyper-relativistic limit.

Whether an almost-commuting pair of operators must be close to a commuting pair is a central question in operator and matrix theory. We investigate this problem for pairs of $C^*$-subalgebras $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ of $M_d(\mathbb{C})$, showing that each operator in $\mathcal{B}$ is $O(d^2\epsilon)$-close in operator norm to an operator in the commutant $\mathcal{A}'$ under two complementary formulations of "$\epsilon$-almost commutation." One formulation is probabilistic, requiring that the operators of $\mathcal{B}$ have small commutators for most Haar-random unitaries acting on $\mathcal{A}$. This first formulation leads to two novel probabilistic generalizations of Stampfli's theorem, which relates an operator's distance from the scalars to the norm of its inner derivation. The second formulation is deterministic, requiring small commutators between the generators of $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$; we analyze this using an approximate Schur's lemma formulated in terms of Weyl-Heisenberg (clock-and-shift) matrices. As an application of our results to quantum information theory, we obtain a quantitative Tsirelson's theorem: in dimension $d$, every $\epsilon$-almost quantum commuting observable model is well approximated by a quantum tensor-product model with error $O(d^2\epsilon)$.

Title:
On quantum ergodicity for higher dimensional cat maps modulo prime powers

A discrete model of quantum ergodicity of linear maps generated by symplectic matrices $A \in \mathrm{Sp}(2d,\mathbb{Z})$ modulo an integer $N\ge 1$, has been studied for $d=1$ and almost all $N$ by P. Kurlberg and Z. Rudnick (2001). Their result has been strengthened by J. Bourgain (2005) and subsequently by A. Ostafe, I. E. Shparlinski, and J. F. Voloch (2023). For arbitrary $d$ this has been studied by P. Kurlberg, A. Ostafe, Z. Rudnick and I. E. Shparlinski (2024). The corresponding equidistribution results, for certain eigenfunctions, share the same feature: they apply to almost all moduli $N$ and are unable to provide an explicit construction of such ``good'' values of $N$. Here, using a bound of I. E. Shparlinski (1978) on exponential sums with linear recurrence sequences modulo a power of a fixed prime, we construct such an explicit sequence of $N$, with a power saving on the discrepancy.

On the Equivalence of Koopman Eigenfunctions and Commuting Symmetries
Xinyuan Jiang, Yan Li
Comments:
7 pages, 1 figure
Subjects:
Systems and Control (eess.SY); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
The Koopman operator framework offers a way to represent a nonlinear system as a linear one. The key to this simplification lies in the identification of eigenfunctions. While various data-driven algorithms have been developed for this problem, a theoretical characterization of Koopman eigenfunctions from geometric properties of the flow is still missing. This paper provides such a characterization by establishing an equivalence between a set of Koopman eigenfunctions and a set of commuting symmetries -- both assumed to span the tangent spaces at every point on a simply connected open set. Based on this equivalence, we derive an explicit formula for the principal Koopman eigenfunctions and prove its uniform convergence on the region of attraction of a locally asymptotically stable equilibrium point, thereby offering a constructive method for computing Koopman eigenfunctions.

Infinite temperature at zero energy

Comments:
12 + 6 pages, 2 figures. v2: minor corrections, additions to the bibliography
Subjects:

We construct a family of static, geometrically local Hamiltonians that inherit eigenstate properties of periodically-driven (Floquet) systems. Our construction is a variation of the Feynman-Kitaev clock -- a well-known mapping between quantum circuits and local Hamiltonians -- where the clock register is given periodic boundary conditions. Assuming the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) holds for the input circuit, our construction yields Hamiltonians whose eigenstates have properties characteristic of infinite temperature, like volume-law entanglement entropy, across the whole spectrum -- including the ground state. We then construct a family of exactly solvable Floquet quantum circuits whose eigenstates are shown to obey the ETH at infinite temperature. Combining the two constructions yields a new family of local Hamiltonians with provably volume-law-entangled ground states, and the first such construction where the volume law holds for all contiguous subsystems.

Interior Spectral Windows and Transport for Discrete Fractional Laplacians on $d$-Dimensional Hypercubic Lattices
Nassim Athmouni
Subjects:
Spectral Theory (math.SP); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Functional Analysis (math.FA)
We study anisotropic fractional discrete Laplacians $\Delta_{\mathbb{Z}^d}^{\vec{\mathbf{r}}}$ with exponents $\vec{\mathbf{r}}\in\mathbb{R}^d\setminus\{0\}$ on $\ell^2(\mathbb{Z}^d)$. We establish a Mourre estimate on compact energy intervals away from thresholds. As consequences we derive a Limiting Absorption Principle in weighted spaces, propagation estimates (minimal velocity and local decay), and the existence and completeness of local wave operators for perturbations $H=\Delta_{\mathbb{Z}^d}^{\vec{\mathbf{r}}}+W(Q)$, where $W$ is an anisotropically decaying potential of long--range type. In the stationary scattering framework we construct the on--shell scattering matrix $S(\lambda)$, prove the optical theorem, and, under a standard trace--class assumption on $W$, establish the Birman--Krein formula $\det S(\lambda)=\exp(-2\pi i\,\xi(\lambda))$.
