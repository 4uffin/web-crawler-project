DGLA Actions: An Application in GR
Ryan Grady
Comments:
8 pages. Based on talk from LT-16 Varna 2025
Subjects:
Mathematical Physics (math-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Quantum Algebra (math.QA)
This note serves two purposes: 1) define actions by differential graded Lie algebras, and 2) apply such differential graded Lie symmetry in general relativity (GR) to constrain the spacetime geometry on a neighborhood of infinity.

Metastable transition times of the 1D dynamical sine-Gordon model
Petri Laarne
Comments:

Subjects:
Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Probability (math.PR)
We study the dynamics of a stochastic heat equation with $\gamma\sin(\beta u)$ nonlinearity on one-dimensional torus. We show an Eyring--Kramers law for the jump rate between potential wells in the small-noise limit, and that the transition state undergoes a bifurcation at $\gamma\beta = 1$. The argument follows the potential-theoretic approach of Berglund and Gentz [Electron. J. Probab. 2013].

Three-dimensional ghost-free representations of the Pais-Uhlenbeck model from Tri-Hamiltonians
Alexander Felski, Andreas Fring, Bethan Turner
Comments:

Subjects:
Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
We present a detailed analysis of the sixth-order Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator and construct three-dimensional ghost-free representations through a Tri-Hamiltonian framework. We identify a six-dimensional Abelian Lie algebra of the PU model's dynamical flow and derive a hierarchy of conserved Hamiltonians governed by multiple compatible Poisson structures. These structures enable the realisation of a complete Tri-Hamiltonian formulation that generates identical dynamical flows. Positive-definite Hamiltonians are constructed, and their relation to the full Tri-Hamiltonian hierarchy is analysed. Furthermore, we develop a mapping between the PU model and a class of three-dimensional coupled second-order systems, revealing explicit conditions for ghost-free equivalence. We also explore the consequences of introducing interaction terms, showing that the multi-Hamiltonian structure is generally lost in such cases.

GUE-corners process in two-periodic Aztec diamonds
Nicolas Robert, Philippe Ruelle
Comments:
28 pages, 6 figures
Subjects:
Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Probability (math.PR)
Links between uniform Aztec diamonds and random matrices are numerous in the literature. In particular \cite{johansson2006eigenvalues,Forrester} established that, under correct rescaling, the probability density function of a certain subclass of dominos converges to the GUE-corners (GUE minor) process in the large size limit. We are interested to see whether this result holds when we modify the probability measure on the space of configurations. In the first part, we look at the case of biased Aztec diamonds, where different weights are associated to vertical and horizontal dominos. In the second part, we examine the case of two-periodic weightings. In both situations, we observe the convergence to GUE-corners with a rescaling that depends on the weighting.

Integrable spin Calogero-Moser type systems with non-symmetric configurations of the singularities of the potential appeared in the work of Chalykh, Goncharenko, and Veselov in 1999. We obtain various generalisations of these examples by making use of the representation theory of Cherednik algebras.

Adiabatic Klein-Gordon Dynamics for the Renormalized Nelson Model
Morris Brooks, David Mitrouskas
Comments:
63 pages
Subjects:
Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
We study the renormalized Nelson model in a semiclassical regime where the field becomes classical while the particle remains quantum. The degree of classicality is measured by a small parameter $\varepsilon \ll 1$. In this scaling the particle evolves on microscopic times, whereas the field exhibits nontrivial dynamics only on the macroscopic scale $t=\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-2})$. The natural semiclassical model is the coupled Schr√∂dinger-Klein-Gordon (SKG) system, which encodes the time-scale separation through an explicit $\varepsilon$-dependence. Based on this scale separation in SKG, we apply the adiabatic principle to derive a new PDE for the classical field, the $\varepsilon$-free adiabatic Klein-Gordon (aKG) equation, where the field is driven by the instantaneous ground state of the particle. Our main result is a norm approximation of the Nelson dynamics by the aKG solution corrected by a quasi-free fluctuation dynamics around the classical field, generated by a renormalized Bogoliubov-Nelson Hamiltonian. As a corollary, we obtain convergence of the reduced one-body densities for both subsystems, where the fluctuation correction vanishes, thereby justifying aKG as a semiclassical Born-Oppenheimer type approximation of the renormalized Nelson model.

Title:
Free mutual information and higher-point OTOCs

We introduce a quantity called the free mutual information (FMI), adapted from concepts in free probability theory, as a new physical measure of quantum chaos. This quantity captures the spreading of a time-evolved operator in the space of all possible operators on the Hilbert space, which is doubly exponential in the number of degrees of freedom. It thus provides a finer notion of operator spreading than the well-understood phenomenon of operator growth in physical space. We derive two central results which apply in any physical system: first, an explicit ``Coulomb gas'' formula for the FMI of two observables $A(t)$ and $B$ in terms of the eigenvalues of the product operator $A(t)B$; and second, a general relation expressing the FMI as a weighted sum of all higher-point out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs). This second result provides a precise information-theoretic interpretation for the higher-point OTOCs as collectively quantifying operator ergodicity and the approach to freeness. This physical interpretation is particularly useful in light of recent progress in experimentally measuring higher-point OTOCs. We identify universal behaviours of the FMI and higher-point OTOCs across a variety of chaotic systems, including random unitary circuits and chaotic spin chains, which indicate that spreading in the doubly exponential operator space is a generic feature of quantum many-body chaos. At the same time, the non-generic behavior of the FMI in various non-chaotic systems, including certain unitary designs, shows that there are cases where an operator spreads in physical space but remains localized in operator space. The FMI is thus a sharper diagnostic of chaos than the standard 4-point OTOC.

Title:
On the universal Casimir spectrum
R. L. Mkrtchyan
Comments:
LaTeX, 15 pages
Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
We conjecture the connection between $su$ and $so$ members of universal, in Vogel's sense, multiplets.
The key element is the notion of the {\it vertical componentwise sum} $\oplus_v$ of Young diagrams. Representations in the decomposition of the power of the adjoint representation of $su(N)$ algebra can be parameterized by a couple of $N$-independent Young diagrams $\lambda$ and $\tau$, with equal area. We assume that the $so(N)$ member of the universal (Casimir) multiplet of a given $su(N)$ representation is the $so$ representation with $\lambda \oplus_v \tau$ Young diagram. This allows one to obtain the universal form of the Casimir eigenvalue on that multiplet. Conjecture is checked for all known cases: universal decompositions of powers of adjoint up to fourth, and series of universal representations.
On this basis we suggest the set of universal Casimirs for fifth power of adjoint. We also conjecture that vertical sum operation is a kind of the (dual version of the) folding map of Dynkin diagrams. This will hopefully explain the intrinsic symmetry of universal formulae with respect to the automorphisms of Dynkin diagrams.

On the geometry of WDVV equations and their Hamiltonian formalism in arbitrary dimension
S. Opanasenko, R. Vitolo
Subjects:
Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems (nlin.SI); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
It is known that in low dimensions WDVV equations can be rewritten as
commuting quasilinear bi-Hamiltonian systems. We extend some of these
results to arbitrary dimension $N$ and arbitrary scalar product $\eta$. In
particular, we show that WDVV equations can be interpreted as a set of linear
line congruences in suitable Pl√ºcker embeddings. This form leads to their
representation as Hamiltonian systems of conservation laws. Moreover, we
show that in low dimensions and for an arbitrary $\eta$ WDVV equations can be
reduced to passive orthonomic form. This leads to the commutativity of the
Hamiltonian systems of conservation laws. We conjecture that such a result
holds in all dimensions.

Large $N$ limit of the Langevin dynamics for the spin $O(N)$ model
Wenjie Ye, Rongchan Zhu
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
In this paper, we prove that the large $N$ limit of the Langevin dynamics for the spin $O(N)$ model is given by a mean-field stochastic differential equation (SDE) in both finite and infinite volumes. We establish uniform in $N$ bounds for the dynamics, which enable us to demonstrate convergence to the mean-field SDE with polynomial interactions. Furthermore, the mean-field SDE is shown to be globally well-posed for suitable initial distributions. We also prove the existence of stationary measures for the mean-field SDE. For small inverse temperatures, we characterize the large $N$ limit of the spin $O(N)$ model through stationary coupling. Additionally, we establish the uniqueness of the stationary measure for the mean-field SDE.

Global stability of the inhomogeneous sheared Boltzmann equation in torus
Renjun Duan, Shuangqian Liu, Shunlin Shen
Comments:
39 pages. All comments are welcome
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
Homo-energetic solutions to the spatially homogeneous Boltzmann equation have been extensively studied, but their global stability in the inhomogeneous setting remains challenging due to unbounded energy growth under self-similar scaling and the intricate interplay between spatial dependence and nonlinear collision dynamics. In this paper, we introduce an approach for periodic spatial domains to construct global-in-time inhomogeneous solutions in a non-conservative perturbation framework, characterizing the global dynamics of growing energy. The growth of energy is shown to be governed by a long-time limit state that exhibits features not captured in either the homogeneous case or the classical Boltzmann theory. The core of our proof is the derivation of new energy estimates specific to the Maxwell molecule model. These estimates combine three key ingredients: a low-high frequency decomposition, a spectral analysis of the matrix associated with the second-order moment equation, and a crucial cancellation property in the zero-frequency mode of the nonlinear collision term. This last property bears a close analogy to the null condition in nonlinear wave equations.

Frozen-corner enumeration of Alternating Sign Matrices
Filippo Colomo, Andrei G. Pronko
Comments:

Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
An Alternating Sign Matrix (ASM) is a square matrix with entries in $\{0,1,-1\}$, and such that: $i)$ in each row and columns, nonzero entries alternate in sign; $ii)$ for any given row or column, entries sum up to 1. We define the frozen-square enumeration as the enumeration of $n\times n$ ASMs under the refinement of having, located in a corner, an $s\times s$ square of entries that are all zeroes. We state a conjectural formula for such enumeration, in terms of a Fredholm type determinant of some $s\times s$ matrix whose entries are given explicitely. We provide numerical support in favour of our conjecture. We also illustrate the relevance of the conjectured formula in connection with the limit shape observed in large ASMs, its fluctuations, and the Tracy--Widom distribution.

Propagation of chaos for first-order mean-field systems with non-attractive moderately singular interaction
Richard M. H√∂fer, Richard Schubert
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Probability (math.PR)
We consider particle systems that evolve by inertialess binary interaction through general non-attractive kernels of singularity $|x|^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha<d-1$. We prove a quantitative mean-field limit in terms of Wasserstein distances under certain conditions on the initial configuration while maintaining control of the particle configuration in the form of the minimal distance and certain singular sums of the particle distances. As a corollary, we show propagation of chaos for $\alpha<\frac{d-1}{2}$ for $d\ge 3$ and $\alpha<\frac 13=\frac{2d-3}{3}$ for $d=2$. This extends the results of Hauray (this https URL), which yield propagation of chaos for $\alpha < \frac{d-2}{2}$ without an assumption on the sign of the interaction. The main novel ingredient is that due to the non-attraction property it is enough to control the distance to the next-to-nearest neighbour particle.

Non-universal Thermal Hall Responses in Fractional Quantum Hall Droplets
Fei Tan, Yuzhu Wang, Xinghao Wang, Bo Yang
Subjects:

We analytically compute the thermal Hall conductance (THC) of fractional quantum Hall droplets under realistic conditions that go beyond the idealized linear edge theory with conformal symmetry. Specifically, we consider finite-size effects at low temperature, nonzero self-energies of quasiholes, and general edge dispersions. We derive measurable corrections in THC that align well with the experimental observables. Although the quantized THC is commonly regarded as a topological invariant that is independent of edge confinement, our results show that this quantization remains robust only for arbitrary edge dispersion in the thermodynamic limit. Furthermore, the THC contributed by Abelian modes can become extremely sensitive to finite-size effects and irregular confining potentials in any realistic experimental system. In contrast, non-Abelian modes show robust THC signatures under perturbations, indicating an intrinsic stability of non-Abelian anyons.

Disconnection probability of Brownian motion on an annulus
Gefei Cai, Xuesong Fu, Xin Sun, Zhuoyan Xie
Comments:
36 pages, 6 figures
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
We derive an exact formula for the probability that a Brownian path on an annulus does not disconnect the two boundary components of the annulus. The leading asymptotic behavior of this probability is governed by the disconnection exponent obtained by Lawler-Schramm-Werner (2001) using the connection to Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE). The derivation of our formula is based on this connection and the coupling with Liouville quantum gravity (LQG). As byproducts of our proof, we obtain a precise relation between Brownian motion on a disk stopped upon hitting the boundary and the SLE$_{8/3}$ loop measure on the disk; we also obtain a detailed description of the LQG surfaces cut by the outer boundary of stopped Brownian motion on a $\sqrt{8/3}$-LQG disk.

Non-associative structures in extended geometry
Martin Cederwall, Jakob Palmkvist
Comments:
7 pages
Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Rings and Algebras (math.RA); Representation Theory (math.RT)
We consider a generalisation of vector fields on a vector space, where the vector space is generalised to a highest-weight module over a Kac-Moody algebra. The generalised vector field is an element in a non-associative superalgebra defined by the module and the Kac-Moody algebra. Also the Lie derivative of a vector field parameterised by another is generalised and expressed in a simple way in terms of this superalgebra. It reproduces the generalised Lie derivative in the general framework of extended geometry, which in special cases reduces to the one in exceptional field theory, unifying diffeomorphisms with gauge transformations in supergravity theories.

The Laplacian with complex magnetic fields
David Krejcirik, Tho Nguyen Duc, Nicolas Raymond
Comments:
Dedicated to Jussi Behrndt on the occasion of his 50th birthday
Subjects:
Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Functional Analysis (math.FA); Spectral Theory (math.SP)
We study the two-dimensional magnetic Laplacian when the magnetic field is allowed to be complex-valued. Under the assumption that the imaginary part of the magnetic potential is relatively form-bounded with respect to the real part of the magnetic Laplacian, we introduce the operator as an m-sectorial operator. In two dimensions, sufficient conditions are established to guarantee that the resolvent is compact. In the case of non-critical complex magnetic fields, a WKB approach is used to construct semiclassical pseudomodes, which do not exist when the magnetic field is real-valued.

A Variational Principle for Extended Irreversible Thermodynamics: Heat Conducting Viscous Fluids
Fran√ßois Gay-Balmaz
Journal-ref:
Journal of Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics, 2025
Subjects:
Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Classical Physics (physics.class-ph)
Extended irreversible thermodynamics is a theory that expands the classical framework of nonequilibrium thermodynamics by going beyond the local-equilibrium assumption. A notable example of this is the Maxwell-Cattaneo heat flux model, which introduces a time lag in the heat flux response to temperature gradients. In this paper, we develop a variational formulation of the equations of extended irreversible thermodynamics by introducing an action principle for a nonequilibrium Lagrangian that treats thermodynamic fluxes as independent variables. A key feature of this approach is that it naturally extends both Hamilton's principle of reversible continuum mechanics and the earlier variational formulation of classical irreversible thermodynamics. The variational principle is initially formulated in the material (Lagrangian) description, from which the Eulerian form is derived using material covariance (or relabeling symmetries). The tensorial structure of the thermodynamic fluxes dictates the choice of objective rate in the Eulerian description, and plays a central role in the emergence of nonequilibrium stresses - arising from both viscous and thermal effects - that are essential to ensure thermodynamic consistency. This framework naturally results in the Cattaneo-Christov model for heat flux. We also investigate the extension of the approach to accommodate higher-order fluxes and the general form of entropy fluxes. The variational framework presented in this paper has promising applications in the development of structure-preserving and thermodynamically consistent numerical methods. It is particularly relevant for modeling systems where entropy production is a delicate issue that requires careful treatment to ensure consistency with the laws of thermodynamics.

Title:
A notion of fractality for a class of states and noncommutative relative distance zeta functional
Yat Tin Chow
Subjects:
Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Operator Algebras (math.OA)
In this work, we first recall the definition of the relative distance zeta function in [42, 43, 44, 46, 47] and slightly generalize this notion from sets to probability measures, and then move on to propose a novel definition a relative distance (and tube) zeta functional for a class of states over a C* algebra. With such an extension, we look into the chance to define relative Minkowski dimensions in this context, and explore the notion of fractality for this class of states. Relative complex dimensions as poles of this newly proposed relative distance zeta functional, as well as its geometric and transformation properties, decomposition rules and properties that respects tensor products are discussed. We then explore some examples that possess fractal properties with this new zeta functional and propose functional equations similar to [11].

Subjects:

The closed-form expressions of electric potentials and field lines for a uniformly-charged tube and cylinder are presented using elliptic integrals and Appell's hypergeometric functions, where field lines are depicted by introducing the concept of the field line potential in axisymmetric systems, whose contour lines represent electric field lines outside the charged region, thought of as an analog of the conjugate harmonic function in the presence of non-uniform metric. The field line potential for the tube shows a multi-valued behavior and enables us to define a topological charge. The integral of $Z(u|m)\operatorname{sc}(u|m)$, where $ Z $ and $ \operatorname{sc} $ are the Jacobi zeta and elliptic functions, is also expressed by Appell's hypergeometric function as a by-product, which was missing in classical tables of formulas. In the Addendum appended after the main article, several relevant references are provided and the decomposition of the solution by ``degrees of transcendence'' is proposed.

We use a 2-categorical version of (de-)equivariantization to classify (3+1)d topological orders with a finite $G$-symmetry. In particular, we argue that (3+1)d fermionic topological order with $G$-symmetry correspond to $\mathbf{2SVect}$-enriched $G$-crossed braided fusion 2-categories. We then show that the categorical data necessary to define these theories agrees with that arising from a fermionic generalization of the Wang-Wen-Witten construction of bosonic topological theories with $G$-symmetry saturating an anomaly. More generally, we also explain how 2-categorical (de-) equivariantization yields a classification of all braided fusion 2-categories.

Subjects:

In this work, we propose a new approach called ``stationary reduction method based on nonisospectral deformation of orthogonal polynomials" for deriving discrete Painlev√©-type (d-P-type) equations. We apply this approach to (bi)orthogonal polynomials satisfying ordinary orthogonality, $(1,m)$-biorthogonality, generalized Laurent biorthogonality, Cauchy biorthogonality and partial-skew orthogonality. As a result, several seemingly novel classes of high order d-P-type equations or integrable difference systems with potential relations with new d-P-type equations, along with their particular solutions and respective Lax pairs, are derived. Notably, the derived integrable difference system related to the Cauchy biorthogonality is a stationary reduction of a nonisospectral generalization involving the first two flows of the Toda hierarchy of CKP type. Additionally, the integrable difference system related to the partial-skew orthogonality is associated with the nonisospectral Toda hierarchy of BKP type, and it is found to admit a solution expressed in terms of Pfaffians.

We consider chiral, generally nonlinear density waves in one dimension, modelling the bosonized edge modes of a two-dimensional fermionic topological insulator. Using the coincidence between bosonization and Lie-Poisson dynamics on an affine U(1) group, we show that wave profiles which are periodic in time produce Berry phases accumulated by the underlying fermionic field. These phases can be evaluated in closed form for any Hamiltonian, and they serve as a diagnostic of nonlinearity. As an explicit example, we discuss the Korteweg-de Vries equation, viewed as a model of nonlinear quantum Hall edge modes.

Ground States for the Defocusing Nonlinear Schr√∂dinger Equation on Non-Compact Metric Graphs
√âlio Durand-Simonnet, Boris Shakarov
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
We investigate the existence and stability of ground states for the defocusing nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equation on non-compact metric graphs. We establish a sharp criterion for the existence of action ground states in terms of the spectral properties of the underlying Hamiltonian: ground states exist if and only if the bottom of the spectrum is negative and the frequency lies within a suitable range. We further explore the relation between action and energy ground states, showing that while every action minimizer yields an energy minimizer, the converse fails in general. In particular, we prove that energy ground states may not exist for arbitrary masses. This discrepancy is illustrated through explicit examples on star graphs with $\delta$ and $\delta'$-type vertex conditions: in the mass-subcritical case, we exhibit a large interval of masses for which no energy minimizer exists, whereas in the supercritical regime, energy ground states exist for all masses.

We propose an approach to Carrollian geometry using principal $\mathbb{R}^\times$-bundles ($\mathbb{R}^\times := \matthbb{R} \setminus \{0\}$) equipped with a degenerate metric whose kernel is the module of vertical vector fields. The constructions allow for non-trivial bundles, and a large class of Carrollian manifolds can be analysed in this formalism. A key result in this is that once a principal connection has been selected, there is a canonical non-degenerate metric that can be leveraged to circumvent the difficulties associated with a degenerate metric. Within this framework, we examine the Levi-Civita connection and null geodesics.

The occurrence of Landau levels in quantum mechanics when a charged particle is subjected to a uniform magnetic field is well known. Considering the recent interest in the electronic properties of graphene, which admits a dispersion relation which is linear in the momentum near the Dirac points, we revisit the problem of Landau levels in the spirit of the Dirac Hamiltonian and ask if there are certain non-uniform magnetic fields which also lead to a spectrum consisting of the Landau levels. The answer, as we show, is in the affirmative. In particular, by considering isospectral deformations of the uniform magnetic field, we present explicit analytical expressions for non-uniform magnetic fields that are strictly isospectral to their uniform counterpart, thus supporting the Landau levels.

We theoretically establish that non-Hermitian perturbations induce a topological transformation of point-like Dirac monopoles into extended monopole distributions, characterized by distinct charge configurations emergent from three distinct Berry connection forms. Using piecewise adiabatic evolution, we confirm the validity of these configurations through observations of complex geometric phases. Most critically, we find a quantitative relation $\Delta \phi_d = \Delta \phi_g$, which quantifies how cumulative minute energy differences (\(\Delta \phi_d\)) manifest as geometric phase shifts (\(\Delta \phi_g\)) uniquely in non-Hermitian systems. We further propose a scheme leveraging soliton dynamics in dissipative two-component Bose-Einstein condensates, enabling direct measurement of these topological signatures. These results establish a milestone for understanding Dirac monopole charge distributions and measuring complex geometric phases in non-Hermitian systems, with far-reaching implications for topological quantum computing and non-Hermitian photonics.
