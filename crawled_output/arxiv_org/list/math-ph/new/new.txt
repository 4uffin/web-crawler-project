Title:
Log-Hausdorff multifractality of the absolutely continuous spectral measure of the almost Mathieu operator
Jie Cao, Xianzhe Li, Baowei Wang, Qi Zhou
Comments:
22 pages
Subjects:
Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Number Theory (math.NT); Spectral Theory (math.SP)
This paper focuses on the fractal characteristics of the absolutely continuous spectral measure of the subcritical almost Mathieu operator (AMO) and Diophantine frequency. In particular, we give a complete description of the (classical) multifractal spectrum and a finer description in the logarithmic gauge. The proof combines continued$-$fraction$/$metric Diophantine techniques and refined covering arguments. These results rigorously substantiate (and quantify in a refined gauge) the physicists' intuition that the absolutely continuous component of the spectrum is dominated by energies with trivial scaling index, while also exhibiting nontrivial exceptional sets which are negligible for classical Hausdorff measure but large at the logarithmic scale.

Title:
Towards a category-theoretic foundation of Classical and Quantum Information Geometry
Florio M. Ciaglia, Fabio Di Cosmo, Laura González-Bravo

Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
We introduce the category $\mathsf{NCP}$, whose objects are pairs of W$^\ast$-algebras and normal states and whose morphisms are state-preserving unital completely positive (CPU) maps, as a common stage for classical and quantum information geometry, and we formulate two results that will appear in forthcoming works.
First, we recast the problem of classifying admissible Riemannian geometries on classical and quantum statistical models in terms of functors $\mathfrak{C}:\mathsf{NCP}\to\mathsf{Hilb}$.These functors provide a generalization of classical statistical covariance, and we call them fields of covariances. A prominent example being the so-called GNS functor arising from the Gelfand-Naimark-Segal (GNS) construction. The classification of fields of covariances on $\mathsf{NCP}$ entails both Čencov's uniqueness of the Fisher-Rao metric tensor and Petz's classification of monotone quantum metric tensors as particular cases.
Then, we show how classical and quantum statistical models can be realized as subcategories of $\mathsf{NCP}$ in a way that takes into account symmetries. In this setting, the fields of covariances determine Riemannian metric tensors on the model that reduce to the Fisher-Rao, Fubini-Study, and Bures-Helstrom metric tensor in particular cases.

Title:
Witt Groups and Bulk-Boundary Correspondence for Stabilizer States
Błażej Ruba, Bowen Yang
Subjects:
Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el); Commutative Algebra (math.AC); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
We establish a bulk--boundary correspondence for translation-invariant stabilizer states in arbitrary spatial dimension, formulated in the framework of modules over Laurent polynomial rings. To each stabilizer state restricted to half-space geometry we associate a boundary operator module. Boundary operator modules provide examples of quasi-symplectic modules, which are objects of independent mathematical interest. In their study, we use ideas from algebraic L-theory in a setting involving non-projective modules and non-unimodular forms. Our results about quasi-symplectic modules in one spatial dimension allow us to resolve the conjecture that every stabilizer state in two dimensions is characterized by a corresponding abelian anyon model with gappable boundary. Our techniques are also applicable beyond two dimensions, such as in the study of fractons.

Virasoro OPE and Conformal Blocks from the Inverse Shapovalov Form
Jean-François Fortin, Lorenzo Quintavalle, Witold Skiba
Comments:
30 pages, no figures, Mathematica notebook attached
Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
We derive expressions for the Virasoro OPE and four-point conformal blocks on the sphere via the resolution of identity recently determined in [Phys. Rev. D 111, 085010 (2025), arXiv:2409.12224]. Even though the resolution of the identity depends on Virasoro singular vectors, our expression for the blocks does not depend on their precise form, but just on their well-known conformal weights. We verify that our expression is compatible with -- but differs from -- Zamolodchikov's $h$-recursion relation and we also examine the impact of various large central charge limits in our formula. A Mathematica notebook with a simple implementation of our expression for the Virasoro conformal blocks is provided as an ancillary file.

Title:
Asymptotics of Jack measures with homogeneous specializations
Evgeni Dimitrov, Xiaohan Gao, Andy Gu, Ryan Niedernhofer
Comments:
45 pages
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
We consider Jack measures on partitions with homogeneous defining specializations. For each of the six distinct classes of measures obtained this way we prove a global law of large numbers with an explicit limiting particle density. We also demonstrate for one of these classes how to obtain a global central limit theorem, global and edge large deviation principles, and edge universality using the results of the paper. Our argument is based on explicitly evaluating Jack symmetric functions at homogeneous specializations, relating the Jack measures to the discrete $\beta$-ensembles from (Publications math{\' e}matiques de l'IH{\' E}S 125, 1-78, 2017) and using the discrete loop equations to substantially reduce computations.

Anomalous dissipation and regularization in isotropic Gaussian turbulence
Theodore D. Drivas, Lucio Galeati, Umberto Pappalettera
Comments:
68 pages. All comments are welcome!
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
In this work we rigorously establish a number of properties of "turbulent" solutions to the stochastic transport and the stochastic continuity equations constructed by Le Jan and Raimond in [Ann. Probab. 30(2): 826-873, 2002]. The advecting velocity field, not necessarily incompressible, is Gaussian and white-in-time, space-homogeneous and isotropic, with $\alpha$-Hölder regularity in space, $\alpha\in (0,1)$. We cover the full range of compressibility ratios giving spontaneous stochasticity of particle trajectories. For the stochastic transport equation, we prove that generic $L^2_x$ data experience anomalous dissipation of the mean energy, and study basic properties of the resulting anomalous dissipation measure. Moreover, we show that starting from such irregular data, the solution immediately gains regularity and enters into a fractional Sobolev space $H^{1-\alpha-}_x$. The proof of the latter is obtained as a consequence of a new sharp regularity result for the degenerate parabolic PDE satisfied by the associated two-point self-correlation function, which is of independent interest. In the incompressible case, a Duchon-Robert-type formula for the anomalous dissipation measure is derived, making a precise connection between this self-regularizing effect and a limit on the flux of energy in the turbulent cascade. Finally, for the stochastic continuity equation, we prove that solutions starting from a Dirac delta initial condition undergo an average squared dispersion growing with respect to time as $t^{1/(1-\alpha)}$, rigorously establishing the analogue of Richardson's law of particle separations in fluid dynamics.

Title:
Time Quasi-Periodic Three-dimensional Traveling Gravity Water Waves

Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
Starting with the pioneering computations of Stokes in 1847, the search of traveling waves in fluid mechanics has always been a fundamental topic, since they can be seen as building blocks to determine the long time dynamics (which is a widely open problem). In this paper we prove the existence of time quasi-periodic traveling wave solutions for three-dimensional pure gravity water waves in finite depth, on flat tori, with an arbitrary number of speeds of propagation. These solutions are global in time, they do not reduce to stationary solutions in any moving reference frame and they are approximately given by finite sums of Stokes waves traveling with rationally independent speeds of propagation. This is a very hard small divisors problem for Partial Differential Equations due to the fact that one deals with a dispersive quasi-linear PDE in higher dimension with a very complicated geometry of the resonances. Our result is the first KAM (Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser) result for an autonomous, dispersive, quasi-linear PDE in dimension greater than one and it is the first example of global solutions, which do not reduce to steady ones in any moving reference frame, for 3D water waves equations on compact domains.

Title:
Wakimoto construction for double loop algebras and $ζ$-function regularisation
Tommaso Franzini
Comments:
27 pages. Accepted version for J. Math. Phys

J. Math. Phys. 1 September 2025; 66 (9): 093502
Subjects:

The Feigin-Frenkel homomorphism underpinning the Wakimoto construction realises an affine Lie algebra at critical level in terms of the $\beta\gamma$-system of free fields. It was recently shown that much of the construction also goes through for double loop algebras. However, certain divergent sums appear. In this paper, we show that, suggestively, these sums vanish when one performs $\zeta$-function regularisation.

Title:
Surprising symmetry properties and exact solutions of Kolmogorov backward equations with power diffusivity
Serhii D. Koval, Elsa Dos Santos Cardoso-Bihlo, Roman O. Popovych
Comments:
39 pages, published version, minor corrections
Subjects:
Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
Using the original advanced version of the direct method, we efficiently compute the equivalence groupoids and equivalence groups of two peculiar classes of Kolmogorov backward equations with power diffusivity and solve the problems of their complete group classifications. The results on the equivalence groups are double-checked with the algebraic method. Within these classes, the remarkable Fokker-Planck and the fine Kolmogorov backward equations are distinguished by their exceptional symmetry properties. We extend the known results on these two equations to their counterparts with respect to a nontrivial discrete equivalence transformation. Additionally, we carry out Lie reductions of the equations under consideration up to the point equivalence, exhaustively study their hidden Lie symmetries and generate wider families of their new exact solutions via acting by their recursion operators on constructed Lie-invariant solutions. This analysis reveals eight powers of the space variable with exponents -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 as values of the diffusion coefficient that are prominent due to symmetry properties of the corresponding equations.

Floquet-like theory and gauge transformations for general smooth dynamical systems
Giuseppe Gaeta, Sebastian Walcher
Comments:
V2: minor misprints corrected, examples added V3: published version
Journal-ref:
OCNMP vol.5 (2025), 57-80
Subjects:
Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Dynamical Systems (math.DS)
The classical Floquet theory allows to map a time-periodic system of linear differential equations into an autonomous one. By looking at it in a geometrical way, we extend the theory to a class of non-autonomous non-periodic equations. This is obtained by considering a change of variables which depends on time in a non-trivial way, i.e. introducing gauge transformations, well known in fundamental Physics and Field Theory -- but which seems to have received little attention in this context.

Title:
Two-phase flows through porous media described by a Cahn--Hilliard--Brinkman model with dynamic boundary conditions
Pierluigi Colli, Patrik Knopf, Giulio Schimperna, Andrea Signori
Journal-ref:
J. Evol. Equ., 24:85, 55 pp. (2024)
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
We investigate a new diffuse-interface model that describes creeping two-phase flows (i.e., flows exhibiting a low Reynolds number), especially flows that permeate a porous medium. The system of equations consists of a Brinkman equation for the volume averaged velocity field as well as a convective Cahn--Hilliard equation with dynamic boundary conditions for the phase-field, which describes the location of the two fluids within the domain. The dynamic boundary conditions are incorporated to model the interaction of the fluids with the wall of the container more precisely. In particular, they allow for a dynamic evolution of the contact angle between the interface separating the fluids and the boundary, and also for a convection-induced motion of the corresponding contact line. For our model, we first prove the existence of global-in-time weak solutions in the case where regular potentials are used in the Cahn--Hilliard subsystem. In this case, we can further show the uniqueness of the weak solution under suitable additional assumptions. Moreover, we further prove the existence of weak solutions in the case of singular potentials. Therefore, we regularize such singular potentials by a Yosida approximation, such that the results for regular potentials can be applied, and eventually pass to the limit in this approximation scheme.

Schwinger-Keldysh non-perturbative field theory of open quantum systems beyond the Markovian regime: Application to spin-boson and spin-chain-boson models

We develop a unified framework for open quantum systems composed of many mutually interacting quantum spins, or any isomorphic systems like qubits and qudits, surrounded by one or more independent bosonic baths. Our framework, based on Schwinger-Keldysh field theory (SKFT), can handle arbitrary spin value S, dimensionality of space, and geometry, while being applicable to a large parameter space for system and bath or their coupling. It can probe regimes in which non-Markovian dynamics and nonperturbative effects pose formidable challenges for other state-of-the-art theoretical methods. This is achieved by working with the two-particle irreducible (2PI) effective action, which resums classes of Feynman diagrams of SKFT to an infinite order. Furthermore, such diagrams are generated via an expansion in 1/N, where N is the number of Schwinger bosons we employ to map spin operators onto canonically commuting ones, rather than via conventional expansion in system-bath coupling constant. We carefully benchmark our SKFT+2PI-computed results vs. numerically (quasi)exact ones from tensor network calculations applied to the archetypical spin-boson model where both methodologies are applicable. Additionally, we demonstrate the capability of SKFT+2PI to handle a much more complex spin-chain-boson model with multiple baths interacting with each spin where no benchmark from other methods is available at present. The favorable numerical cost of solving integro-differential equations produced by the SKFT+2PI framework with an increasing number of spins and time steps makes it a promising route for simulating driven-dissipative systems in quantum computing, quantum magnonics, and quantum spintronics.

Modular Intersections, Time Interval Algebras and Emergent AdS$_2$

Comments:

Subjects:

We compute the modular flow and conjugation of time interval algebras of conformal Generalized Free Fields (GFF) in $(0+1)$-dimensions in vacuum. For non-integer scaling dimensions, for general time-intervals, the modular conjugation and the modular flow of operators outside the algebra are non-geometric. This is because they involve a Generalized Hilbert Transform (GHT) that treats positive and negative frequency modes differently. However, the modular conjugation and flows viewed in the dual bulk AdS$_2$ are local, because the GHT geometrizes as the local antipodal symmetry transformation that pushes operators behind the Poincaré horizon. These algebras of conformal GFF satisfy a $\textit{Twisted Modular Inclusion}$ and a $\textit{Twisted Modular Intersection}$ property. We prove the converse statement that the existence of a (twisted) modular inclusion/intersection in any quantum system implies a representation of the (universal cover of) conformal group $PSL(2,\mathbb{R})$, respectively. We discuss the implications of our result for the emergence of Stringy AdS$_2$ geometries in large $N$ theories without a large gap. Our result applied to higher dimensional eternal AdS black holes explains the emergence of two copies of $PSL(2,\mathbb{R})$ on future and past Killing horizons.

Walks in Rotation Spaces Return Home When Doubled and Scaled
Jean-Pierre Eckmann, Tsvi Tlusty
Subjects:
Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Dynamical Systems (math.DS)
The dynamics of numerous physical systems, such as spins and qubits, can be described as a series of rotation operations, i.e., walks in the manifold of the rotation group. A basic question with practical applications is how likely and under what conditions such walks return to the origin (the identity rotation), which means that the physical system returns to its initial state. In three dimensions, we show that almost every walk in SO(3) or SU(2), even a very complicated one, will preferentially return to the origin simply by traversing the walk twice in a row and uniformly scaling all rotation angles. We explain why traversing the walk only once almost never suffices to return, and comment on the problem in higher dimensions.

The fibered rotation number for ergodic symplectic cocycles and its applications: I. Gap Labelling Theorem
Xianzhe Li, Li Wu
Comments:

Subjects:
Dynamical Systems (math.DS); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Spectral Theory (math.SP)
Let $ (\Theta,T,\mu) $ be an ergodic topological dynamical system. The fibered rotation number for cocycles in $ \Theta\times \mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R}) $, acting on $ \Theta\times \mathbb{R}\mathbb{P}^1
$ is well-defined and has wide applications in the study of the spectral theory of Schrödinger operators. In this paper, we will provide its natural generalization for higher dimensional cocycles in $ \Theta\times\mathrm{SP}(2m,\mathbb{R}) $ or $ \Theta\times \mathrm{HSP}(2m,\mathbb{C}) $, where $ \mathrm{SP}(2m,\mathbb{R}) $ and $ \mathrm{HSP}(2m,\mathbb{C}) $ respectively refer to the $ 2m $-dimensional symplectic or Hermitian-symplectic matrices. As a corollary, we establish the equivalence between the integrated density of states for generalized Schrödinger operators and the fibered rotation number; and the Gap Labelling Theorem via the Schwartzman group, as expected from the one dimensional case [AS1983, JM1982].

The Ising model on cubic maps: arbitrary genus
Mireille Bousquet-Mélou, Ariane Carrance, Baptiste Louf
Comments:
Updated version, 34 pages, 6 figures
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
We design a recursive algorithm to compute the partition function of the Ising model, summed over cubic maps with fixed size and genus. The algorithm runs in polynomial time, which is much faster than methods based on a Tutte-like, or topological, recursion.
We construct this algorithm out of a partial differential equation that we derive from the first equation of the KP hierarchy satisfied by the generating function of bipartite maps. This series is indeed related to the Ising partition function by a change of variables. We also obtain inequalities on the coefficients of this partition function, which should be useful for a probabilistic study of cubic Ising maps whose genus grows linearly with their size.

Transport alpha divergences
Wuchen Li
Comments:
Some typos are corrected. Comments are welcome
Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
We derive a class of divergences measuring the difference between probability density functions on a one-dimensional sample space. This divergence is a one-parameter variation of the {Itakura--Saito} divergence between quantile density functions. We prove that the proposed divergence is one-parameter variation of transport Kullback-Leibler divergence and Hessian distance of negative Boltzmann entropy with respect to Wasserstein-2 metric. From Taylor expansions, we also formulate the $3$-symmetric tensor in Wasserstein space, which is given by an iterative Gamma three operators. The alpha-geodesic on Wasserstein space is also derived. From these properties, we name the proposed information measures transport alpha divergences. We provide several examples of transport alpha divergences for generative models in machine learning applications.

Subjects:

This work focuses on the emergence of dark phases (dark energy-induced phases) in the radial wave function of scalar particles. We achieve this by presenting novel solutions to the Klein-Gordon equation in a spherically symmetric spacetime, which encompasses a black hole, a quintessential fluid, and a cloud of strings. We determine the exact solution for the spacetime metric, analyze the admissible ranges for its physical parameters, and discuss the formation of the event horizon. Subsequently, we detail the solution of the Klein-Gordon equation and explore three distinct cases of dark phases, corresponding to the quintessence state parameter $\alpha_{Q}$ taking the values $0$, $1/2$, and $1$. Notably, the case where $\alpha_{Q} = 1$ holds particular significance due to current observational constraints on dark energy.

We investigate the collective dynamics of multivortex assemblies in a two dimensional (2D) toroidal fluid film of distinct curvature and topology. The incompressible and inviscid nature of the fluid allows a Hamiltonian description of the vortices, along with a self-force of geometric origin, arising from the standard Kirchhoff-Routh regularization procedure. The Hamiltonian dynamics is constructed in terms of $q$-digamma functions $\Psi_q(z)$, closely related to the Schottky-Klein prime function known to arise in multiply connected domains. We show the fundamental motion of the two-vortex system and identify five classes of geodesics on the torus for the special case of a vortex dipole, along with subtle distinctions from vortices in quantum superfluids. In multivortex assemblies, we observe that a randomly initialized cluster of vortices of the same sign and strength (chiral cluster) remains geometrically confined on the torus, while undergoing an overall drift along the toroidal direction, exhibiting collective dynamics. A cluster of fast and slow vortices also show the collective toroidal drift, with the fast ones predominantly occupying the core region and the slow ones expelled to the periphery of the revolving cluster. Vortex clusters of mixed sign but zero net circulation (achiral cluster) show unconfined dynamics and scatter all over the surface of the torus. A chiral cluster with an impurity in the form of a single vortex of opposite sign also show similar behavior as a pure chiral cluster, with occasional ``jets" of dipoles leaving and re-entering the revolving cluster. The work serves as a step towards analysis of vortex clusters in models that incorporate harmonic velocities in the Hodge decomposition.

Exact solution of asymmetric gelation between three walks on the square lattice

Subjects:

We find and analyse the exact solution of a model of three different
polymers with asymmetric contact interactions in two dimensions, modelling a
scenario where there are different types of polymers involved. In particular, we find
the generating function of three directed osculating walks in star
configurations on the square lattice with two interaction Boltzmann weights,
so that there is one type of contact interaction between the top pair of walks and a
different interaction between the bottom pair of walks. These osculating
stars are found to be the most amenable to exact solution using functional
equation techniques in comparison to the symmetric case where three friendly
walks in watermelon configurations were successfully solved with the same
techniques. We elucidate the phase diagram, which has four phases, and find
the order of all the phase transitions between them. We also calculate the
entropic exponents in each phase.

Theoretical analysis of biological and artificial neural networks e.g. modelling of synaptic or weight matrices necessitate consideration of the generic real-asymmetric matrix ensembles, those with varying order of matrix elements e.g. a sparse structure or a banded structure. We pursue the complexity parameter approach to analyze the spectral statistics of the multiparametric Gaussian ensembles of real asymmetric matrices and derive the ensemble averaged spectral densities for real as well as complex eigenvalues. Considerations of the matrix elements with arbitrary choice of mean and variances render us the freedom to model the desired sparsity in the ensemble. Our formulation provides a common mathematical formulation of the spectral statistics for a wide range of sparse real-asymmetric ensembles and also
reveals, thereby, a deep rooted universality among them.

Quadrature Domains and the Faber Transform
Andrew J. Graven, Nikolai G. Makarov
Comments:
60 Pages, 21 Figures
Subjects:
Complex Variables (math.CV); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
We present a framework for reconstructing any simply connected, bounded or unbounded, quadrature domain $\Omega$ from its quadrature function $h$. Using the Faber transform, we derive formulae directly relating $h$ to the Riemann map for $\Omega$. Through this approach, we obtain a complete classification of one point quadrature domains with complex charge. We proceed to develop a theory of weighted quadrature domains with respect to weights of the form $\rho_a(w)=|w|^{2(a-1)}$ when $a > 0$ ("power-weighted" quadrature domains) and the limiting case of when $a=0$ ("log-weighted" quadrature domains). Furthermore, we obtain Faber transform formulae for reconstructing weighted quadrature domains from their respective quadrature functions. Several examples are presented throughout to illustrate this approach both in the simply connected setting and in the presence of rotational symmetry.
