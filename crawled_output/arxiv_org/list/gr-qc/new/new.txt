Title:
Strange quark stars in mimetic gravitational theory

This paper presents a novel anisotropic quark star model in the backdrop of mimetic gravitational theory. Our study focuses on the strange quark stars using the MIT bag equation of state (EoS) admitting non-singular Buchdahl metric function. The proposed model matches the interior spacetime of the strange quark star with the exterior Schwarzschild spacetime. Our analysis of the energy conditions, radial and tangential EoSs along with the energy momentum tensor gradients and TOV equilibrium condition analysis support the model's physical validity. Further study of adiabatic index, surface redshift function and speed of sound analysis have demonstrated the stability of the strange quark star in mimetic gravity. Thus, we can say that the model stability and consistency have been validated for various parameter values of the Buchdahl function throughout our study in the context of mimetic gravity.

Detecting regular precession using a new gravitational waveform model directly parameterized by both precession amplitude and frequency

Nearly 210 binary black hole (BBH) mergers have been observed by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA network during its four observing runs. Generic BBHs are spinning, and their spins are misaligned with the orbital angular momentum $\vec{L}$. These misaligned spins cause $\vec{L}$ to precess in a cone with dimensionless precession amplitude $\tilde{\theta}$ and frequency $\tilde{\Omega}$ about the nearly constant direction of the total angular momentum. This precession modulates the observed GWs. We propose a model of regularly precessing (RP) waveforms that incorporates $\tilde{\theta}$ and $\tilde{\Omega}$ directly as parameters. We investigate how these waveforms vary as functions of these precessional parameters, as well as binary orientation and sky location. We use the Lindblom criterion to estimate that precession can be detected in a RP source with signal-to-noise ratio $\rho$ when the mismatch $\epsilon$ with a non-precessing (NP) source with otherwise identical parameters exceeds $1/2\rho^2$. Precession is most detectable when $\vec{L}$ precesses through configurations we call +~nulls during the inspiral. At +~nulls, a NP source only emits +-polarization to which the GW detector is insensitive. The large mismatch between a RP source and this vanishing NP signal enhances the detectability of precession. We also explore the detectability of precession as a function of redshift $z$ for different BBH populations. We find that for BBHs with isotropically oriented maximal spins, precession is detectable in a majority of systems out to $z \approx 0.3$ for chirp masses $10 \lesssim M_c/M_\odot \lesssim 40$ and mass ratios $q \gtrsim 0.5$. Reduced spin magnitudes or greater alignment between the spins and $\vec{L}$ make it difficult to observe beyond $z \approx 0.1$. (abridged)

Imprints of quantum vacuum fluctuations on the gravitational field of a spherical mass

The Schwarzschild geometry, describing the gravitational field of a spherical mass in classical vacuum, is one of the most famous vacuum solutions of the Einstein field equations. Classical vacuum is an idealization that does not include quantum vacuum fluctuations of quantum fields, and determining the form of the gravitational field of a spherical mass in quantum vacuum is an important step towards understanding the interplay between gravity and quantum field theory. We formulate and prove general results on the space of static, spherically symmetric and asymptotically flat spacetimes sourced by quantum vacuum fluctuations, obtained under the broad assumptions that the quantum vacuum energy density is negative and unbounded on Killing horizons. In particular, we show the generic replacement of Killing horizons by wormhole throats. We discuss how previous calculations in the literature that have used different prescriptions for the regularized vacuum expectation value of the quantum stress-energy tensor are particular cases of our general results.

Spin-induced Quadrupole Moment (SIQM) Test for Eccentric Compact Binaries

General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
Spin-induced deformations of individual components of a binary can be quantified using the gravitational wave signal the binary emits. Such deformations are characterised by a parameter, $ \kappa $, which takes a value of 1 for a black hole and thus its measurement can be used to test the no-hair conjecture. However, in practice, only a symmetric combination of this parameter for a binary ($ \kappa_s $) can be measured, thus instead enabling a test for the no-hair conjecture in the context of a binary black hole system; see for instance, Krishnendu et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 119, 091101 (2017), arXiv:1701.06318. While previous studies have focused on circular binaries, we extend this test to eccentric systems in a Fisher matrix based analysis. We find that the error in the measurement of the parameter $ \kappa_s $ reduces from a value of about 18% (for the circular case) to close to 8% (4%) for a $ 10 M_{\odot} $ system with dimensionless component spins $ >0.8 $ and with a reference initial eccentricity ($ e_0 $) of 0.2 (0.4) evaluated at 5 Hz for a third generation detector, Cosmic Explorer (CE). Compared to the estimates obtained by using Advanced LIGO design sensitivity, eccentricity and the overall improved sensitivity of CE detectors together seem to improve these estimates almost by an order of magnitude.

Probing For Non-Gravitational Long-Range Dark Matter Interactions

Dark matter remains a mystery in fundamental physics. The only evidence for dark matter's existence is from gravitational interactions. We constructed a precision torsion balance experiment to search for non-gravitational, long-range interactions between ordinary matter in our lab and the Milky Way's dark matter. We find no evidence of such interaction and set strict upper bounds on its strength. These results suggest that dark matter only interacts gravitationally over long distances and constrains a variety of dark matter theories.

AdS Black Hole Solution with a Dark Matter Halo Surrounded by a Cloud of Strings

We derive and analyze a Schwarzschild-like Anti-de Sitter (AdS) black hole (BH) obtained as a static, spherically symmetric solution of Einstein's equations sourced by a cloud of strings (CoS) and a dark matter (DM) halo modeled by a Dehnen-type density profile. We first study the geodesic motion of massless and massive test particles, emphasizing how the CoS parameter $\alpha$ and the DM halo parameters $(\rho_s, r_s)$ influence photon spheres, circular orbits, the BH shadow, and the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO). We then examine scalar perturbations via the effective potential and the associated quasinormal-mode (QNM) spectra, showing how $\alpha$ and $(\rho_s, r_s)$ deform oscillation frequencies and damping rates, thereby affecting stability diagnostics. Furthermore, we investigate the thermodynamics in the extended phase space, deriving the Hawking temperature, equation of state, Gibbs free energy, and specific heat capacity, and establishing a consistent first law and Smarr relation with natural work terms for $\alpha$ and $(\rho_s, r_s)$. We find that the interplay between the CoS and the DM halo produces quantitative and sometimes qualitative changes in both dynamical and thermodynamical properties, including shifts of the Hawking--Page transition and heat-capacity divergences, thus reshaping the phase structure of Schwarzschild--AdS BHs.

Black Hole Superradiance of Interacting Multi-Field

We investigate black hole superradiance evolution of the interacting multiple fields. We consider a model of two scalar fields interacting with a cubic coupling, and study the superradiant evolution of the cloud. We demonstrate that superradiance is typically suppressed when the superradiant field couples to another field, even with a very weak coupling strength. This implies that the constraints on dark particles derived from single-field analyses can be revised in the presence of interactions. Moreover, we find that the multi-field superradiant evolution and its corresponding observational signatures can be different across parameter spaces, which makes black hole superradiance an even more powerful probe of the dark sector in particle physics.

Transformer Networks for Continuous Gravitational-wave Searches

Wide-parameter-space searches for continuous gravitational waves (CWs) using semi-coherent matched-filter methods require enormous computing power, which limits their achievable sensitivity. Here we explore an alternative search method based on training neural networks as classifiers on detector strain data with minimal pre-processing. Contrary to previous studies using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we investigate the suitability of the transformer architecture, specifically the Vision Transformer (ViT). We establish sensitivity benchmarks using the matched-filter $\mathcal{F}$-statistic for ten targeted searches over a 10 day timespan, and ten directed and six all-sky searches over a 1 day timespan. We train ViTs on each of these benchmark cases. The trained ViTs achieve essentially matched-filter sensitivity on the targeted benchmarks, and approach the $\mathcal{F}$-statistic detection probability of $p_{\mathrm{det}}$ = 90% on the directed ($p_{\mathrm{det}} \approx $ 85-89 %) and all-sky benchmarks ($p_{\mathrm{det}} \approx $ 78-88 %). Unlike the CNNs in our previous studies, which required extensive manual design and hyperparameter tuning, the ViT achieves better performance with a standard architecture and minimal tuning.

In this paper, we study a self-dual black hole (BH) in Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG), analyzing both timelike and null geodesics. Using observational data from Mercury's perihelion shift and the orbit of the S2 star around Sagittarius A$^{\star}$ (Sgr A$^{\star}$), we derive constraints on the polymeric function $P$. We further investigate photon trajectories near the self-dual BH under various scenarios to explore their observational relevance. Finally, we examine the properties of accretion disks around the self-dual BH in LQG, including their direct and secondary images, and study the redshift and the observed energy flux distribution across the accretion disk as measured by distant observers for different inclination angles. Our findings provide new insights into the physical nature and accretion properties of self-dual BHs in LQG and their possible observational consequences.

Gravitational perturbations of Dymnikova black holes: grey-body factors and absorption cross-sections
Alexey Dubinsky
Subjects:
General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
We study axial gravitational perturbations of the Dymnikova regular black hole, an asymptotically flat spacetime in which the Schwarzschild singularity is replaced by a de Sitter core. Using the WKB method with PadÃ© approximants, we compute grey-body factors, and absorption cross-sections, and test the recently proposed correspondence between quasinormal frequencies and transmission coefficients. We find that variations of the quantum parameter \(l_{\rm cr}\) affect the effective potential only near the horizon, leading to minor deviations of grey-body factors and absorption cross-sections from the Schwarzschild case. As a result, the Hawking radiation spectrum is governed mainly by the modified Hawking temperature, with grey-body factors providing only subleading corrections. Unlike higher quasinormal overtones, which are highly sensitive to near-horizon deformations, the grey-body factors remain robust, a feature explicitly confirmed for the Dymnikova geometry. The correspondence between quasinormal modes and grey-body factors holds in our case with high accuracy for multipoles $\ell \geq 2$.

Time delay in matched exterior and interior Kottler solutions
Mourad Guenouche
Comments:

Subjects:
General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
We extend the study of gravitational lensing to photons traversing the lens mass, modeled as a uniform-density fluid described by the interior Kottler (Schwarzschild--de Sitter) solution smoothly matched to the exterior Kottler region. An analytic expression for the time delay is derived, allowing the interior contribution to be explicitly isolated relative to the vacuum Kottler case. This correction is found to systematically enhance the total time delay, an effect corroborated by numerical evaluations for astrophysically relevant lenses at both galaxy and cluster scales. These results underscore the importance of accounting for the interior lens structure in accurate modeling of strong lensing time delays.

We analytically solve the constraints in General Relativity for two black holes with arbitrary momenta and spin up to third order in these parameters. We compute the location and geometry of the apparent horizon, which depend on the spins, momenta, relative orientation angles, and the separation between the black holes, and present the result in a coordinate-independent form. We also extract the ADM mass and the irreducible mass and verify their consistency. The final expressions are depicted in a coordinate-independent form. The results can be easily extended to any number of black holes and used to complement numerical relativity simulations.

In this manuscript, I discuss the possibility of sending a small probe to the closest black hole with the goal of addressing some fundamental questions of modern physics. Are astrophysical black holes the Kerr black holes predicted by General Relativity? Do astrophysical black holes have an event horizon? Is the physics around a black hole the same physics as in our laboratories on Earth? While we do not have the technology for a similar mission today, it may be available in the next 20-30 years. The whole mission may last up to a century (depending on the actual distance of the black hole and the speed of the probe), but it may represent a unique opportunity to perform precise and accurate tests of General Relativity in the strong field regime.

Picosecond-level corrections to the Shapiro time delay in a Schwarzschild spacetime
Oscar del Barco
Comments:

Subjects:
General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
We present an exact analytical equation for the Shapiro time delay (STD) due to a spherical non-rotating body. As a result, accurate values of the STD in comparison with first and second-order expressions for Schwarzschild spacetime (1Sch and 2Sch) and first-order post-Newtonian formalism (1PN) are achieved. Accordingly, the lowest STD discrepancies between our exact equation and these approximations lie within the picosecond and sub-picosecond level for light beams affected by the Sun's gravity. Our results might be useful for time delay measurements in the solar system or extragalactic binary pulsar systems, where a high accuracy level is required.

Solving the Trans-Planckian Censorship Problem with a Power-law Tail in $R^2$ Inflation: A Dynamical System Approach

In this work we elaborate on solving the trans-Planckian censorship problem of standard slow-roll inflation by using a power-law inflationary tail generated by a scalar field with an exponential potential. We use a quantitative approach by studying in detail the phase space of a combined $F(R,\phi)$ cosmological system, focusing on the de Sitter and power-law subspaces of the total phase space. As we show, the de Sitter subspace of the $F(R,\phi)$ system shares the same fixed points as the vacuum $F(R)$ gravity system and the trajectories in the phase space tend to these fixed points. However, the power-law subspace is not stable and cannot be realized by the combined $F(R,\phi)$ system. To this end, we propose a well-motivated phenomenological $F(R)$ gravity model for which the $R^2$ term is switched off below a critical curvature near the end of the $R^2$ slow-roll inflationary era, and below that critical curvature, only the Einstein-Hilbert gravity term and the scalar field remain in the effective inflationary Lagrangian. The remaining system can successfully realize a power-law tail of the $R^2$ slow-roll era.

Gravitational collapse with torsion and universe in a black hole
Nikodem PopÅawski
Comments:
6 pages
Subjects:
General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
We consider gravitational collapse of a fluid sphere with torsion generated by spin, which forms a black hole. We use the Tolman metric and the Einstein$-$Cartan field equations with a relativistic spin fluid as a source. We show that gravitational repulsion of torsion prevents a singularity, replacing it with a nonsingular bounce. Quantum particle creation during contraction prevents shear from overcoming torsion. Particle creation during expansion can generate a finite period of inflation and produce large amounts of matter. The resulting closed universe on the other side of the event horizon may have several bounces. Such a universe is oscillatory, with each cycle larger than the preceding cycle, until it reaches a size at which dark energy dominates and expands indefinitely. Our Universe might have therefore originated from a black hole existing in another universe.

We present a theoretical study of the magnetic field generated by a toroidal current loop situated in the equatorial plane of a non-rotating Schwarzschild black hole, based on the dynamics of charged particles. Using the exact general relativistic solution for the magnetic field, we analyze particle motion both analytically and numerically, identifying regions of stable and unstable orbits. In particular, we classify charged particle dynamics into attractive and repulsive Lorentz force configurations and show that in the attractive case, charged particles can accumulate near the current loop, forming collective currents that oppose the original current loop magnetic field. We demonstrate that charged particle accumulation can lead to the formation of toroidal structures analogous to radiation belts in the BH magnetosphere. We compare the curved spacetime solution to flat spacetime analogs and highlight general relativistic effects such as the existence of the innermost stable circular orbit for charged particles, which sets a lower bound for radiation belt formation. The divergence of the vector potential at the loop location in the idealized infinitesimal loop model is addressed, and we argue that a physically realistic model must consider a finite-width current distribution to avoid unphysical divergences in the effective potential.

We discuss and formalize a topological means by which the initial singularity might be mollified, at the level of the spacetime manifold's structure, in classical cosmological models of a homogeneous expanding universe. The construction, dubbed a "reflective" topological big bang, generalizes Schrodinger's elliptic de Sitter space and is built to be compatible with the standard Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) picture of the large-scale universe, only minimally modifying it via some nontrivial topology at an earliest "moment" in the universe's history. We establish a mathematical characterization of the admissible topological structures of reflective topological big bangs, and we discuss implications for a standard concern in cosmology, the horizon problem. We present a nonreflective example that we've christened the Itty-Bitty Blender spacetime: this spacetime and its universal cover, the Eternal Trumpet spacetime, exhibit interesting potential structures of spacetimes avoiding the Hawking and Penrose singularity theorems.

General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
Within a semiclassical framework, we investigate spherically symmetric solutions of the Einstein equations that (i) develop a trapped region within a finite time as measured by distant observers, and (ii) remain sufficiently regular at the apparent horizon. These requirements characterize the self-consistent approach, and it imposes specific constraints on the limiting form of the energy momentum tensor (EMT). Previous works argued that only certain EMT classes admit viable dynamical solutions, while discarding others (see, e.g., Terno 2020) based on reasoning that is not entirely robust. Here, we explicitly demonstrate that the discarded classes are indeed unphysical. In addition, we also introduce a new class of static solutions that are regular at the horizon and allow finite-time horizon crossing according to a distant observer.

We present a singularity-free relativistic interior solution for constructing stable quark stellar models in the framework of a linear $f(Q)$ gravity ($f(Q) = \alpha Q + \phi$) satisfying the pseudo-spheroidal geometry. The physical features and the stability of the stellar model is explored with strange star (SS) candidate EXO 1745-248 ($M = 1.7\, M_{\odot}$ and $R = 9\, km$). The Durgapal-Banerjee transformation is employed to obtain the relativistic interior solution using the MIT Bag model equation of state (EoS): $P = \frac{1}{3}(\rho - 4 B_{g})$. For a linear form of $f(Q)$ gravity, we obtain the exterior vacuum solution, which reduces to the Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS) solution with the cosmological constant term, $\Lambda = \frac{\phi}{2\alpha}$. The stellar model is analyzed for the different values of the spheroidicity parameter ($\mu$). The value of $\alpha$ is constrained using a viable physical limit on the Bag parameter ($B_{g} \in [57.55,95.11]\,MeV\,fm^{-3}$). The constraints on Mass-Radius relation indicates that physically acceptable SS models are permitted for $\mu \geq 7$. The contribution of $\mu$ to the energy density, pressure profiles, and other physical features is studied for the SS candidate EXO 1745-248. The stability of the stellar model obtained here is also analyzed through causality condition, adiabatic index and other stability criteria. We also investigate the stellar model for other SS candidates to test its viability. The relativistic interior solution obtained here can be used to construct viable and physically acceptable strange star models with very high compactness ratio in the framework of linear $f(Q)$ gravity.

We study inflationary characterictics of the universe in $n$-DBI gravity, driven by DBI-deformed scalar fields. In this paper, we consider the evolution of the classical universe for a scalar potential whose equations of motion are expressed by a BPS-like system of first-order differential this http URL advantage of a BPS-like system is that it allows the initial condition for the wave function of the Universe in minisuperspace quantum cosmology to be automatically determined by the Hamiltonian constraint. By appropriately choosing the prepotential underlying the potential, we can construct single-scalar-field models that have the phases of exponential and power-law expansions. We show that the slow-roll parameters for our models can be expressed in terms of the prepotential with simple settings.

Yes, it can.
Catalogs produced by networks of Gravitational-wave interferometers are subject to complicated selection effects, and the gold-standard remains direct measurements of the detection probability through large injection campaigns. I leverage public data products from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaborations' 3rd and 4th observing runs to show that there are non-trivial temporal variations within the detection probability that are well-described by a weekly cycle. There are clear differences between weekends and weekdays, between day and night (at the sites), and even between daylight-savings and standard time. I discuss possible causes for this behavior and implications.

Universal relations for fast rotating neutron stars without equation of state bias

Subjects:
General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
We provide a summary of several parametrisations for the nuclear equation of state that have been proposed over the past decades and list viable ranges for their parameters. Based on these parametrisations, we construct a large database of rotating neutron star models, which are arranged in sequences of constant central energy density. After filtering these sequences with respect to generous astrophysical constraints, we discover tight universal relations for various bulk quantities of uniformly rotating neutron stars of arbitrary rotation rates. These universal relations allow to estimate, at very low computational cost, bulk quantities of rotating neutron stars employing mass, radius, and moment of inertia of associated non-rotating neutron stars. The relations are calibrated to a large, model-agnostic dataset, thereby eliminating a potential bias, and prove to be robust. Such relations are important for future, high-precision measurements coming from electromagnetic and gravitational wave observations and may be used in equation of state inference codes or gravitational wave modeling among others.

This work aims to explore the gravitational consequences of a recently proposed black hole solution presented in the literature [Phys. Dark Univ. 50 (2025) 102061]. We initiate our analyzes by taking into account the horizon structure, focusing on both the event and Cauchy horizons. Subsequently, we examine the quasinormal modes by considering all types of perturbations -- scalar, vector, tensor, and spinorial. To strengthen these results, we also compute the time-domain for each perturbation. Next, we turn to the study of optical properties of the black hole. In particular, we investigate null geodesics, the photon sphere and its stability, as well as the corresponding black hole shadows. Following this, we analyze gravitational lensing phenomena in two regimes: the weak-field limit, utilizing the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, and the strong deflection limit, employing Tsukamoto's approach. In addition, we confront the lensing observables with Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) data for $Sgr A^{*}$ and $M87^{*}$. Finally, constraints on the parameter $\xi$ -- which is introduced by higher-order curvature-scalar gravity, thereby differing from the Schwarzschild solution -- are estimated using Solar System measurements such as the precession of Mercury's orbit, gravitational light bending, and time delay (or Shapiro effect).

This paper systematically investigates the quasinormal modes (QNMs) and tidal Love numbers of covariant quantum-modified black holes (BHs) within two cosmological constant-dependent metric frameworks. By deriving axial/polar perturbation equations and employing pseudospectral methods (for QNMs) and numerical integration (for Love numbers), we quantify the quantum parameter $\zeta$'s influence. We find that, higher overtones exhibit enhanced $\zeta$ sensitivity. Solution 1 maintains purely imaginary QNMs under $\zeta$ variation, whereas Solution 2 demonstrates mode transitions from real to complex for polar/axial perturbations. Furthermore, for Love number, axial perturbations show non-monotonic $\zeta$ dependence, with $\Delta\mathcal{T}^a_l$ peaking at specific $\ell$ values before decay. While for polar perturbation of the same metric displays strictly monotonic $\zeta$ effects on $\Delta\mathcal{T}^p_l$. These results highlight quantum gravity's role in BH perturbation dynamics and cosmological BH phenomenology.

We propose the Jiggled Interferometer (JIGI), a novel ground-based gravitational wave detector with space-like sensitivity. Using rapidly-repeated free-fall test masses, JIGI eliminates seismic and suspension thermal noise during free fall. Compared to the Juggled Interferometer, it offers improved angular stability and avoids tracking lasers. We analyze detrending--a required step to remove actuation-induced noise--and show sensitivity gains of about four orders of magnitude in the 0.1-0.3 Hz band, relative to seismic and suspension noise extrapolated from the Cosmic Explorer.

We obtain the four-derivative corrections to the Kerr-Sen solution in heterotic supergravity, which includes the Gibbons-Maeda-Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger solution as a limiting case. In particular, we first embed the Kerr solution into heterotic supergravity and compute the higher-derivative corrections. We then obtain the corrections to the Kerr-Sen solution by performing an $O(2,1)$ boost of the Kerr solution, which, in contrast to the two-derivative case, requires field redefinitions to make the $O(2,1)$ invariance of the action manifest. Finally, we compute the multipole moments and find that they are distinct from those of the Kerr solution at the four-derivative level. We also find that the multipole moments are distinct from those of the Kerr-Newman solution in Einstein-Maxwell theory at the four-derivative level, even for the most general choice of four-derivative corrections. This gives a way to experimentally distinguish traces of string theory in gravitational wave data.

Entanglement entropies computed using the holographic Ryu-Takayanagi formula are known to obey an infinite set of linear inequalities, which define the so-called RT entropy cone. The general structure of this cone, or equivalently the set of all valid inequalities, is unknown. It is also unknown whether those same inequalities are also obeyed by entropies computed using the covariant Hubeny-Rangamani-Takayanagi formula, although significant evidence has accumulated that they are. Using Markov states, we develop a test of this conjecture in a heretofore unexplored regime. The test reduces to checking that a given inequality obeys a certain majorization property, which is easy to evaluate. We find that the RT inequalities pass this test and, surprisingly, only RT inequalities do so. Our results not only provide strong new evidence that the HRT and RT cones coincide, but also offer a completely new characterization of that cone.

CWT-LSTM Autoencoder: A Novel Approach for Gravitational Wave Detection in Synthetic Data

Subjects:
Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
Gravitational wave detection requires sophisticated signal processing to identify weak astrophysical signals buried in instrumental noise. Traditional matched filtering approaches face computational challenges with diverse signal morphologies and non-stationary noise. This work presents a deep learning approach combining Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) preprocessing with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) autoencoder architecture for gravitational wave detection in synthetic data. The CWT provides optimal time-frequency decomposition capturing chirp evolution and transient characteristics essential for compact binary coalescence identification. The LSTM autoencoder learns compressed representations while maintaining sensitivity to subtle signal features distinguishing true astrophysical events from noise artifacts. We generate realistic synthetic datasets incorporating binary black hole merger signals with masses ranging from 10 to 80 solar masses, embedded in colored Gaussian noise representative of Advanced LIGO sensitivity. The trained model demonstrates strong performance metrics: 92.3 percent precision, 67.6 percent recall, and 80.6 percent AUC-ROC, with an average precision score of 0.780. These results exceed LIGO's stringent detection thresholds for confident gravitational wave identification. Compared to traditional approaches, the CWT-LSTM autoencoder shows superior ability to maintain low false alarm rates while preserving sensitivity to weak signals. The method's end-to-end learning eliminates hand-crafted features and template banks, offering a promising pathway toward more robust gravitational wave detection systems. The unsupervised nature enables discovery of signals with unknown morphologies, providing complementary "blind search" capability for detecting exotic astrophysical sources and novel physics beyond current theoretical models.

Bias in the tensor-to-scalar ratio from self-interacting dark radiation

We investigate the cosmological imprint of self-interacting dark radiation (DR) on the primordial $B$-mode angular power spectrum and its impact on the estimation of the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. We consider a minimal model in which DR is described as an effectively massless axion-like particle with quartic self-interactions. These interactions are incorporated into the Einstein-Boltzmann equations using the relaxation time approximation and implemented in the $\texttt{CLASS}$ code. We show that increasing the strength of DR self-interactions suppresses anisotropic stress, thereby reducing the damping of gravitational waves and leading to an enhancement of the primordial $B$-mode signal relative to the free-streaming case. Using mock CMB data and Markov Chain Monte Carlo analyses, we show that neglecting DR self-interactions may bias the inferred value of $r$ by an amount comparable to the uncertainty expected in forthcoming CMB polarization experiments, such as the ground-based $\textit{Simons Observatory}$ and the satellite missions $\textit{LiteBIRD}$ and PICO. Our results emphasize the importance of properly modeling DR interactions in future precision searches for primordial $B$-modes in order to obtain unbiased constraints on inflationary gravitational waves.

Early JWST observations reveal an unexpectedly abundant population of high-redshift candidate massive galaxies at $z \gtrsim 7$, and recent DESI measurements show a preference for dynamical dark energy, which together present a significant challenge to the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. In this work, we jointly analyze high-redshift galaxy data from JWST, baryon acoustic oscillations data from DESI DR2, and cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from Planck and ACT, measuring the total neutrino mass $\sum m_{\nu}$. We consider three dark energy models ($\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, and $w_0w_a$CDM) and three mass hierarchies. Our results indicate that in the $w_0w_a$CDM model, adding JWST data to CMB+DESI tightens the upper limit of $\sum m_{\nu}$ by about $5.8\%-10.2\%$, and we obtain $\sum m_{\nu} < 0.167~\mathrm{eV}$ ($2\sigma$) in the normal hierarchy (NH) case. Furthermore, JWST also offers indicative lower limits on star formation efficiency parameter of $f_{*,10} \gtrsim 0.146-0.161$. Bayesian evidence weakly favors the $w_0w_a$CDM+$\sum m_{\nu}$(NH) model relative to the $\Lambda$CDM+$\sum m_{\nu}$(NH) model using CMB+DESI+JWST data. These results suggest that the joint analysis of high-redshift JWST data and low-redshift DESI data provides compelling constraints on neutrino mass and merits further investigation.

We develop a flexible framework based on physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for solving boundary value problems involving minimal surfaces in curved spacetimes, with a particular emphasis on singularities and moving boundaries. By encoding the underlying physical laws into the loss function and designing network architectures that incorporate the singular behavior and dynamic boundaries, our approach enables robust and accurate solutions to both ordinary and partial differential equations with complex boundary conditions. We demonstrate the versatility of this framework through applications to minimal surface problems in anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime, including examples relevant to the AdS/CFT correspondence (e.g. Wilson loops and gluon scattering amplitudes) popularly used in the context of string theory in theoretical physics. Our methods efficiently handle singularities at boundaries, and also support both "soft" (loss-based) and "hard" (formulation-based) imposition of boundary conditions, including cases where the position of a boundary is promoted to a trainable parameter. The techniques developed here are not limited to high-energy theoretical physics but are broadly applicable to boundary value problems encountered in mathematics, engineering, and the natural sciences, wherever singularities and moving boundaries play a critical role.

Gravitational Entropy

We formulate the classical gravitational entropy of a horizon as a Noether charge that does not require the notion of a temperature, and which is applicable to horizons that are not necessarily associated with black holes. This introduces a correction to the covariant phase space formalism that accounts for the configuration-dependence of the generating vector field conjugate to the charge. The vector field is related to the proposal of Bousso that the gravitational entropy of a region is determined by the lightsheet at its boundary. We test the formula on various black hole and cosmological horizons.

A Dark Matter Model with Quadratic Equation of State: Background Evolution and Structure Formation

We propose that dark matter (DM) possesses a quadratic equation of state, which becomes significant at high densities, altering the Universe's evolution during its early stages. We derive the modified background evolution equations for the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ and the DM density parameter $\Omega_{\text{dm}}(z)$. We then perturb the governing equations to study the linear growth of matter fluctuations, computing the observable growth factor $f\sigma_8(z)$. Finally, we compare the model with the latest cosmological data, including Hubble parameter $H(z)$ measurements, and growth factor $f\sigma_8(z)$ data, up to $z=3$. Our results indicate that the quadratic model, while remaining consistent with background observations, offers a distinct imprint on the growth of structure, providing not only a new phenomenological avenue to address cosmological tensions but also shedding light on the nature of DM.

Inflationary trispectrum of gauge fields from scalar and tensor exchanges

In this paper, we compute the inflationary trispectrum of primordial gauge fields generated through the scalar and tensor exchanges in models with spectator $U(1)$ gauge fields which are kinetically coupled to the inflaton. Focusing on the connected four-point autocorrelation function of gauge fields, we derive exact analytical expressions for the full trispectrum of both electric and magnetic fields using the in-in formalism and cosmological diagrammatic rules, and explore their respective contributions in specific momentum configurations. For the scalar exchange, we find that the trispectrum signal in the equisided configuration grows with the exchange momentum and reaches its maximum in the flattened limit. However, in the counter collinear limit, we show that the non-linearity parameter associated with the trispectrum scales quadratically with the corresponding parameter of the cross-correlation bispectrum of magnetic fields and curvature perturbations, thereby establishing a hierarchical relation between the higher- and lower-order correlation functions. For the tensor exchange, the trispectrum displays a richer angular dependence, reflecting the sensitivity to the orientation of the momentum quadrilateral with respect to the tensor polarisation, producing characteristic angular modulations in the trispectrum. Detecting such angular signatures in future high-precision cosmological observations would provide a novel window into tensor-mediated interactions in the early universe.

Probing Hernquist dark matter with black hole shadows: A comprehensive study of various accretions

The appearance of a black hole shadow, in both astronomical observations and theoretical analysis, depends critically on the properties of the surrounding accretion. In this study, we analyse the emission and observational properties of a Schwarzschild black hole surrounded by a Hernquist dark matter (DM) halo by considering three simplified accretion models, which have not been previously explored in such detail. Based on our findings, direct emission contributes markedly to the whole observed intensity for a Schwarzschild-Hernquist black hole encircled by a geometrically thin accretion disk. The corresponding regions and measured intensities of the lensing ring, the photon ring, and direct emission are sensitive to the parameters of the Hernquist DM halo. Apart from disk accretion, we also study two spherical accretion models: static and infalling. With increasing Hernquist DM parameters, both models exhibit a significant decrease in the measured intensity, yet the photon spheres are enlarged by an increase of $\sim2\%$ to $\sim30\%$. Furthermore, Doppler de-boosting due to the infalling accretion results in darker shadow images compared to static cases. By precising visualisations of the shadows, our results suggest that the observational characteristics of black hole shadows can serve as a powerful probe for distinguishing between different DM distributions around supermassive black holes.

Existence of uniform Temple charts and applications to null distance

In this paper, we prove that Temple's cylindrical future null coordinate charts can be constructed uniformly and we estimate the gradients of their optical functions. We then apply these charts to study a spacetime $(N,g)$ that has been converted into a definite metric space $(N,\hat{d}_\tau)$, where $\hat{d}_\tau$ is the null distance of Sormani and Vega defined using a locally anti-Lipschitz (in the sense of Chrusciel, Grant, and Minguzzi) generalized time function $\tau$. In particular, in the case when $\tau$ is Lipschitz we prove that $(N, \hat{d}_\tau)$ is a rectifiable metric space, where the causal structure is locally encoded by $\tau$ and $\hat{d}_\tau$. As a consequence, applying a classical theorem of Hawking and following a technique developed by Sakovich and Sormani, we can prove a Lorentzian isometry theorem, generalizing our earlier result.

We quantize D$0$-brane, the simplest representative of the family of supersymmetric Dirichlet p-branes, in its spinor moving frame formulation and analyze its quantum state spectrum. Besides being a preparatory stage for quantization of the complete supersymmetric multiple D$0$-brane (mD$0$) model, which is presently known only in the frame of spinor moving frame formalism, this is interesting as its own: despite the covariant quantization of D=10 D$0$-brane was discussed before, its quantum state spectrum was not analyzed and its field theory, describing that, was not studied.
We show that the quantum state vector of the D$0$-brane is described by an on-shell superfield that collects the fields of the massive counterpart of the linearized type IIA supergravity supermultiplet which can be obtained as massive Kaluza-Klein mode of the dimensional reduction of the eleven dimensional supergravity down to ten dimensions. In conclusion, we briefly discuss a spinor helicity formalism for D$0$-brane which can be used as one of the basic elements for developing type IIA string theory amplitude calculus based on multiparticle generalizations of the on-shell superfields.

Scalar fields in 4D are known to have equivalent dual descriptions in terms of form-field gauge potentials, but this is often regarded as an arcane fact. Why use more complicated formulations when simpler scalar descriptions exist and are equivalent? We describe three ways in which scalars that arise as duals can differ from their garden-variety counterparts. Two of these -- the interchange of weak and strong couplings and utility in bringing topological information to the low-energy theory -- are relatively well-known, but to these we add a third: dualities that map derivative interactions to non-derivative interactions seem not to commute with the general power-counting arguments that quantify control over the low-energy approximation within any EFT involving gravity. Since both sides of the duality must agree on their low-energy limit, the non-derivative interactions on the scalar side of the duality turn out to be suppressed relative to what would generically be assumed. They are nonetheless technically natural, as is particularly clear in the dual formulation. We argue that scalar fields arising as duals (such as the universal axion $a$ from string vacua) that have the commonly assumed $J^\mu \partial_\mu a$ interaction with matter also have $J^\mu J_\mu$ contact interactions among the respective currents, some of whose implications we explore. We also emphasize the non-trivial role and cosmological implications of non-propagating 3-form gauge potentials and clarify confusing statements recently made in the literature regarding the validity of duality for massive form fields.

Motivated by certain recent works, we study thermodynamic and optical properties of the Reissner-NordstrÃ¶m-AdS black holes in a noncommutative spacetime with a string cloud and quintessence dark fields. After analyzing the global and the local stabilities, we examine the criticality and the Joule-Thomson expansion behaviors in such noncommutative backgrounds. Concretely, we find that the critical universal numbers X_N can be expressed as X_0 + NX, where N is the quintessence parameter and X_0 is the critical universal number of the Reissner-NordstrÃ¶m-AdS black holes in a NC spacetime without additional external fields. Furthermore, we find that Van der Waals behaviors can be recovered by strictly constraining the charge in terms of external parameters. To conclude this work, we compute and examine the deflection angle of lights in such a modified spacetime geometry.

We propose an O(100)m Atom Interferometer (AI) experiment to be installed against a wall of the PX46 access shaft to the LHC. This experiment would probe unexplored ranges of the possible couplings of bosonic ultralight dark matter (ULDM) to atomic constituents and undertake a pioneering search for gravitational waves (GWs) at frequencies intermediate between those to which existing and planned experiments are sensitive, among other fundamental physics studies. A conceptual feasibility study showed that this AI experiment could be isolated from the LHC by installing a shielding wall in the TX46 gallery, and surveyed issues related to the proximity of the LHC machine, finding no technical obstacles. A detailed technical implementation study has shown that the preparatory civil-engineering work, installation of bespoke radiation shielding, deployment of access-control systems and safety alarms, and installation of an elevator platform could be carried out during LS3, allowing installation and operation of the detector to proceed during Run 4 without impacting HL-LHC operation. These studies have established that PX46 is a uniquely promising location for an AI experiment. We foresee that, if the CERN management encourages this Letter of Intent, a significant fraction of the Terrestrial Very Long Baseline Atom Interferometer (TVLBAI) Proto-Collaboration may wish to contribute to such an AI experiment.

Understanding the formation and evolution of stellar-mass binary black holes (BBHs) requires a thorough investigation of the key physical processes involved. While one pathway involves the isolated evolution of massive binary stars, affected by uncertain stages like core-collapse supernovae and common envelope evolution, an alternative channel is dynamical formation in dense stellar environments. Newtonian gravity has traditionally provided a robust and computationally efficient framework for modeling large-scale gravitational interactions. However, accurately capturing close encounters and black hole mergers necessitates the use of general relativity. This work focuses on assessing the applicability of post-Newtonian gravity in bridging these regimes, offering a physically insightful and computationally tractable approach to modeling BBH formation in the gravitational-wave era of astronomy.

It is commonly recognized that the primordial scalar spectral index $n_s$ is approximately $0.96-0.975$, depending on the dataset. However, this view is being completely altered by the early dark energy (EDE) resolutions of the Hubble tension, known as the most prominent tension the standard $\Lambda$CDM model is suffering from. In corresponding models with pre-recombination EDE, resolving the Hubble tension (i.e., achieving $H_0\sim 73$km/s/Mpc) must be accompanied by a shift of $n_s$ towards unity to maintain consistency with the cosmological data, which thus implies a scale invariant Harrison-Zel'dovich spectrum with $n_s=1$ $(|n_s-1|\simeq {\cal O}(0.001))$. In this work, we strengthen and reconfirm this result with the latest ground-based CMB data from ACT DR6 and SPT-3G D1, the precise measurements at high multipoles beyond the Planck angular resolution and sensitivity. Our work again highlights the importance of re-examining our understanding on the very early Universe within the broader context of cosmological tensions.

This work considers how exponential corrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula affect the thermodynamic behavior of the FLRW cosmological model. These corrections drastically change the form of the Friedman field equations inducing non-trivial phase transition behavior. For negative values of the trace parameter $\alpha$, the system presents first-order phase transitions above the critical temperature, and for positive $\alpha$, the system undergoes a reentrant phase transition. As these corrections are presumably relevant at the early Universe stage, to corroborate the presence of some potential vestige of this contribution in the current era, a study has been carried out comparing observational data and current values of the Hubble parameter.

We develop a framework based on modern amplitude techniques to analyze emission and absorption effects in black hole physics, including Hawking radiation. We first discuss quantum field theory on a Schwarzschild background in the Boulware and Unruh vacua, and introduce the corresponding $S$-matrices. We use this information to determine on-shell absorptive amplitudes describing processes where a black hole transitions to a different mass state by absorbing or emitting quanta, to all orders in gravitational coupling. This on-shell approach allows for a universal description of black holes, with their intrinsic differences encapsulated in the discontinuities of the amplitudes, without suffering from off-shell ambiguities such as gauge freedom. Furthermore, the absorptive amplitudes serve as building blocks to describe physics beyond that of isolated black holes. As applications, we find that the Hawking thermal spectrum is well understood by three-point processes. We also consider a binary system and compute the mass shift of a black hole induced by the motion of a companion object, including quantum effects. We show that the mean value of the mass shift is classical and vacuum-independent, while its variance differs depending on the vacuum choice. Our results provide confirmation of the validity of the on-shell program in advancing our understanding of black hole physics.

Title:
Robust Areal Thermodynamics of the Schwarzschild Black Hole with Robin Boundary Conditions and Weyl Asymptotics

We formulate an areal thermodynamics for the Schwarzschild black hole that takes the horizon area as the sole macroscopic variable. Quantizing ultrarelativistic interior modes on a regular spacelike slice with a Robin boundary at a stretched horizon leads to a self-adjoint Laplace-Beltrami problem with Heun-type quantization. A maximum-entropy area ensemble introduces an intensive areal temperature $T_A$, and Weyl/heat-kernel asymptotics control the resulting statistical mechanics. The leading equations of state follow universally from the spatial Weyl volume coefficient: in a canonical ensemble of $N$ ultrarelativistic bosons one finds $A = 3 N k_B T_A$ up to a boundary-dependent constant, while in the massless grand-canonical sector $A \propto T_A^{4}$ with a generalized Planck spectrum and a Wien displacement relation. These scaling exponents are insensitive to Dirichlet/Neumann/Robin data and to the foliation; only numerical prefactors vary. Embedding the construction into a static four-dimensional background via Matsubara factorization reproduces the 4D Weyl law and yields a finite matter entropy $S_{\mathrm{rad}} \propto A^{3/4}$, parametrically subleading to the Bekenstein-Hawking term after standard renormalization. The framework provides a concise, mathematically controlled bridge between interior spectral data and macroscopic area relations, clarifying the scope and limitations of areal thermodynamics.

We calculate the gravitational waveform radiated from spinning black holes (BHs) binary in dynamical Chern-Simons (dCS) gravity. The equation of motion (EOM) of the spinining binary BHs is derived based on the modified Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equation for the spin-aligned circular orbits. The leading-order effects induced by the dCS theory contains spin-spin interaction and monopole-quadrupole interaction, which influence both the EOM of the binary system and corresponding gravitational waveform at the second post-Newtonian (PN) order (i.e., 2PN order). After reporting the waveforms, we investigate the polarization modes of gravitational waves (GWs) in dCS theory. None of the extra modes appears in this theory up to the considered PN order. Moreover, since the time scale of the binary merger is much smaller than that of the cosmological expansion, the parity-violating effect of the dCS theory does not appear in the process of GW generation. However, during the process of GW propagation, amplitude birefringence, a typical parity-violating effect, makes plus and cross modes convert to each other, which modifies the gravitational waveform at 1.5PN order.

In this manuscript, we address the issue of the loss of SU(2) internal symmetry in Loop Quantum Cosmology and its relationship with Loop Quantum Gravity. Drawing inspiration from Yang-Mills theory and employing the framework of fiber bundle theory, we propose a new gauge-invariant symmetry-reduction approach. Using this method, we successfully identify a cosmological sector of General Relativity in terms of Ashtekar variables that preserves the SU(2) structure of the theory as well as part of the diffeomorphism gauge symmetry. Additionally, we analyze the properties of cylindrical functions and the classical constraint algebra, revealing that certain cylindrical functions exhibit distinctive symmetry features.

Compact objects observed in gravitational-wave astronomy so far always come in pairs and never individually. Identifying the two components of a binary system is a delicate operation that is often taken for granted. The labeling procedure (i.e., which is object "1" and which is object "2") effectively acts as systematics, or, equivalently an unspecified prior, in gravitational-wave data inference. The common approach is to label the objects solely by their masses, on a sample-by-sample basis. We show that object identification can instead be tackled using the posterior distribution as a whole. We frame the problem in terms of constrained clustering -- a flavor of semi-supervised machine learning -- and find that unfolding the labeling systematics can significantly impact, and arguably improve, our interpretation of the data. In particular, the precision of black-hole spin measurements improves by up to 50%, multimodalities and tails tend to disappear, posteriors become closer to Gaussian distributions, and the identification of the nature of the object (i.e. black hole vs. neutron star) is facilitated. We estimate that about 10% of the LIGO/Virgo posterior samples are affected by this relabeling, i.e. they might have been attributed to the other compact object in the observed binaries.

This paper investigates the implications from area quantization in Loop Quantum Gravity, particularly focusing on the application of the Landauer principle -- a fundamental thermodynamic concept establishing a connection between information theory and thermodynamics. By leveraging the Landauer principle in conjunction with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy law, we derive the usual value for the Immirzi parameter precisely, $\gamma = \ln2/(\pi \sqrt{3})$, without using the typical procedure that involves the Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy. Furthermore, following an analogous procedure, we derive a modified expression for the Immirzi parameter aligned with Barrow's entropy formulation. Our analysis also yields a new expression for the Immirzi parameter consistent with a corresponding modified Kaniadakis entropy for black hole entropy further illustrating, along with Barrow's entropy, the applicability of Landauer's principle in alternative statistical contexts within black hole physics.

Hawking radiation and black hole thermodynamics are well understood in the frameworks of quantum field theory and general relativity, with contemporary extensions in string theory, AdS/CFT, and loop quantum gravity. However, an open question remains: Can Hawking radiation be consistently described using statistical mechanics? This challenge arises due to the ambiguous quantum nature of Hawking particles and constraints imposed by information conservation. This study develops a heuristic statistical model using a worldine Lagrangian formalism, treating Hawking particles as timelike with an effective mass and following an arbitrary statistical distribution. The flow of information is modeled as a transfer of microstates from the event horizon to the radiation background within a closed ensemble. From this framework, the Hawking particle mass $m_H=\hbar/(2\pi r_S)$ is recovered, and the worldline Lagrangian yields the black hole's thermal energy, $E=\hbar/(8\pi GM)$. Beyond preserving conventional insights, reinforcing the statistical nature of black hole evaporation, this approach introduces novel perspectives: modeling the black hole as a structured energy well containing microstates, quantifying the evaporation rate of individual microstates, and determining the total number of microstates from the horizon's surface area. This study leaves the door open for a stochastic mechanical analysis, which is introduced in the Discussion section.

In the present study we search for a new class of wormhole solutions in the framework of Brans-Dicke (BD) theory in the presence of anisotropic matter distribution. Considering a linear equation of state (EoS) between radial pressure and energy density profile we find exact static spherically symmetric solutions to the BD field equations which represent wormhole configurations. The solutions we obtain include both cases with zero and nonzero redshift functions, for which, the conditions on wormhole geometry together with the weak (WEC) and null (NEC) energy conditions put constraints on model parameters such as, the BD coupling and EoS parameters. These constraints also depend on other model parameters such as, the value of BD scalar field and energy density at the wormhole throat. The regularity of the obtained solutions is verified by calculating the Kretschmann scalar in order to ensure that curvature singularities are absent in the wormhole spacetime. We then find that BD wormholes in the presence of anisotropic matter can exist without violating NEC and WEC, either at the throat or across the entire spacetime.

String-inspired models are often believed to provide an interesting framework for quantum gravity and force unification with promising prospects to resolve issues like dark matter and dark energy which cannot be satisfactorily incorporated within the framework of general relativity (GR). The goal of the present work is to investigate the role of the Einstein-Maxwell dilaton-axion (EMDA) gravity arising in the low energy effective action of the heterotic string theory in explaining astrophysical observations, in particular, the high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (HFQPOs) observed in the power spectrum of black holes. EMDA gravity has interesting cosmological implications and hence it is worthwhile to explore the footprints of such a theory in available astrophysical observations. This requires one to study the stationary, axi-symmetric black hole solution in EMDA gravity, which corresponds to the Kerr-Sen spacetime. Such black holes are endowed with a dilatonic charge while the rotation is sourced from the axionic field. We investigate the orbital and epicyclic frequencies of matter rotating in the Kerr-Sen spacetime and consider eleven well-studied QPO models in this work. We compare the model dependent QPO frequencies with the available observations of five BH sources, namely, XTE J1550-564, GRS 1915+105, H 143+322, GRO J1655-40 and Sgr A*. Our analysis provides constrains on the spins of the aforesaid black holes which when compared with previous estimates enables us to understand the observationally favored QPO models for each of these sources. Further, from the current data the EMDA scenario cannot be ruled out in favor of general relativity. We comment on the implications and limitations of our finding and how the present constrains compare with the existing literature.

This study tackles the impact Dark Energy (DE) in different systems by a simple unifying formalism. We introduce a parameter space that compare gravity across all cosmic scales, using the McVittie spacetime (McV) and connects spherically symmetric solutions with cosmological solutions. By analyzing the invariant scalars: the Ricci, Weyl, and Kretschmann scalars, we develop a phase-space description that predicts the dominance of the Cosmological Constant. We explore three cases: (1) the local Hubble flow around galaxy groups and clusters, (2) spherical density distributions and (3) binary motion. Our results show that the Kretschmann scalar of galaxy groups and clusters in their turnaround is $2\Lambda^2$ which is three times the Kretschmann scalar of the Cosmological Consonant. This quantifies the DE domination in local structures.

The influence of cosmological constant on light deflection in rotating spacetimes via the generalized Gibbons-Werner method

Recently, we proposed a generalized Gibbons-Werner (GW) method for analyzing particle trajectories in rotating spacetimes, regardless of their asymptotic behavior [Huang \textit{et al.}, \href{this https URL}{J. Cosmol. Astropart. Phys. 01(2024), 013}]. Using this method, we examine the impact of the cosmological constant ($\Lambda$) on the light deflection in rotating spacetimes within the framework of Kerr-de Sitter (KdS) geometry. Although Sultana previously calculated the deflection angle of light in KdS spacetime, our study advances this research in three aspects: (i) Orbit solution -- the light trajectory is derived by directly solving the original equation of motion (EOM) without intermediate processes. (ii) Positions of the source and observer -- the finite distances of the source and observer from the lens are explicitly considered, avoiding approximations. (iii) Staticity of the source and observer -- the Randers optical space is employed to resolve the staticity constraint. Through these refined considerations, we obtain a novel expression for the deflection angle of light in KdS spacetime, accurate to second-order in $\Lambda$, as well as in the mass (M) and spin parameter (a) of the central body. Furthermore, we discuss the discrepancies between our results and previous expressions. Finally, we evaluate the observational implications of our corrections relative to Sultana's work in the lensing systems of the Sun and Sgr A*, and show that they may become observable with forthcoming high-precision astronomical measurements.

Black holes are among the most well-known astrophysical objects, yet their physical realisation remains conceptually subtle. We analyse physical black holes -- light-trapping regions that form in finite time as seen by a distant observer -- and investigate the properties of the matter required to support them. Taking Buchdahl's theorem as a benchmark, we show that these configurations necessarily violate at least two of its four original conditions, and the post-formation state violates them all. These violations are substantial: they include the null energy condition, non-monotonic energy profiles, and strong pressure anisotropies. Thus, the requirement of truly forming a horizon places physical black holes in a class of solutions that are more exotic than exotic compact objects.

Instrumental artefacts, such as glitches, can significantly compromise the scientific output of LISA. Our methodology employs advanced Bayesian techniques, including Reversible Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo and parallel tempering to find and characterize glitches and astrophysical signals. The robustness of the pipeline is demonstrated through its ability to simultaneously handle diverse glitch morphologies and it is validated with a 'Spritz'-type data set from the LISA Data Challenge. Our approach enables accurate inference on Massive Black Hole Binaries, while simultaneously characterizing both instrumental artefacts and noise. These results present a significant development in strategies for differentiating between instrumental noise and astrophysical signals, which will ultimately improve the accuracy and reliability of source population analyses with LISA.

Recovering Einstein equations from local information recorded by quantum reference frames
Eduardo O. Dias

Subjects:

We propose that, for a sufficiently small spacelike region $B$, deviations of the metric field from flat space encode the information recorded by a quantum reference frame (RF) placed in $B$. This encoding underlies the metric's ability to specify infinitesimal proper times and proper distances that ideal observers would assign, without requiring their physical presence. For purely classical correlations between the RF and the quantum fields within $B$, our hypothesis reproduces the Einstein equation with an undetermined cosmological constant. In this regime, the metric encodes a classical description of the fields in $B$ as perceived by the RF. When local quantum correlations are included, the Einstein equation arises with a positive cosmological constant, proportional to the surface density of those correlations.

Analog gravity experiments are making remarkable strides in unveiling both the classical and quantum nature of black holes. By harnessing diverse states of matter, contemporary tabletop setups now replicate strong-field phenomena typically confined to the enigmatic regions surrounding black holes. Through these modern gravity simulators, physical processes once considered elusive may finally be brought into experimental reach. In this work, we investigate the spectrum of massless scalar excitations propagating within the effective geometry of a rotating acoustic metric. Specifically, we build an analog vortex-like spacetime endowed with a tunable parameter that emulates the geometry of a rotating gravitational background. This model accommodates both the presence of a sonic horizon, characteristic of an acoustic black hole for non-zero tuning parameters, and its absence when the parameter vanishes, yielding a horizonless, purely rotational vortex flow devoid of radial inflow. We focus on the case where the vortex flow is purely rotational. The resulting spectral properties is found to be qualitatively consistent with that observed in recent experimental realizations of giant multiply quantum vortices featuring solid or hollow cores. This correspondence suggests that the analog spacetime used here holds significant potential to replicate, qualitatively, the phenomenology of cutting-edge laboratory experiments. In doing so, it offers new insight into the intricate landscape of analog black-hole spectroscopy and, potentially, the resonant topography of bounded, rotating astrophysical environments around black holes.

Initial orbital eccentricities of gravitational wave (GW) events associated with merging binary black holes (BBHs) should provide clues to their formation scenarios, mainly because various BBH formation channels predict distinct eccentricity distributions. However, searching for inspiral GWs from eccentric BBHs is computationally challenging due to sophisticated approaches to model such GW events. This ensures that Bayesian parameter estimation methods to characterize such events are computationally daunting. These considerations influenced us to propose a novel approach to identify and characterize eccentric BBH events in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration data sets that leverages external attention transformer models. Employing simulated data that mimic LIGO O4 run, eccentric inspiral events modeled by an effective-one-body numerical-relativity waveform family, we show the effectiveness of our approach. By integrating this transformer-based framework with a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, we provide efficient way to identify eccentric BBH GW events and accurately characterize their source properties.

Subjects:

Black hole (BH) shadow observations and gravitational wave astronomy have become crucial approaches for exploring BH physics and testing gravitational theories in extreme environments. This paper investigates the charged black hole with scalar hair (CBH-SH) derived from the Einstein-Maxwell-conformal coupled scalar (EMCS) theory. We first constrain the parameter space $(Q/M, s/M^2)$ of the BH using the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of M87* and Sgr A*. The results show that M87* provides stronger constraints on positive scalar hair, constraining the scalar hair $s$ within $0\le s/M^2\le0.4632$ and the charge $Q$ within the range $0\le Q/M\le0.6806$. In contrast, Sgr A* imposes tighter constraints on negative scalar hair. When $Q$ approaches zero, $s$ is constrained within the range $0\geq s/M^2\geq-0.0277$. Overall, EHT observations can provide constraints at most on the order of $\mathcal{O}\left({10}^{-1}\right)$. Subsequently, we construct extreme mass ratio inspiral (EMRI) systems and calculate their gravitational waves to assess the detection capability of the LISA detector for these BHs. The results indicate that for central BHs of $M={10}^6M_\odot$, LISA is expected to detect scalar hair $s/M^2$ at the $\mathcal{O}\left({10}^{-4}\right)$ level and charge $Q/M$ at the $\mathcal{O}\left({10}^{-2}\right)$ level, with detection sensitivity far exceeding the current EHT capabilities. This demonstrates the immense potential of EMRI gravitational wave observations in testing EMCS theory.

In this study, we explore the potential of using TianQin missions to probe the local gravitational effects of dark matter. The TianQin project plans to launch satellites at both low and high orbits. High-precision orbit determination is expected to aid in detecting Earth's gravity or gravitational waves. By comparing the derived masses in low and high orbits, it is possible to constrain the amount of dark matter between the two spheres, hence placing a local constraint on dark matter's gravitational effect. Our results show the capability of TianQin in detecting the density of dark matter around Earth, with an ultimate sensitivity to a value of $10^{-8}\,\,{\rm kg\,\,m^{-3}}$. This detection limit surpasses the estimated bounds for the solar system and the observation results for our Galaxy by approximately 7 and 14 orders of magnitude, respectively.

We analyze the stationary, uncharged, rotating, vacuum solution to Weyl conformal gravity. We elucidate the causal and ergoregion structure of the spacetimes found in the parameter space of the metric for positive mass. These are then compared to the analogous Kerr, Kerr-de Sitter, and Kerr-Anti-de Sitter solutions to general relativity. Additionally, we investigate and derive the extremal limits for both the horizons and ergosurfaces of the spacetimes. The horizon surface gravities and Hawking temperatures at the extremal horizon limits are then calculated to show that they vanish.

In this work, we establish the existence conditions and a universal upper bound on the radius of stable photon spheres (SPS) outside the event horizons of static, spherically symmetric, asymptotically flat black holes surrounded by matter fields. We prove that stable photon spheres exist if the external matter satisfies specific conditions. Furthermore, under the additional assumption of a monotonically decreasing mass-radius ratio $m(r)/r^3$ outside the horizon, we derive a strict upper bound on the radius $r_{\mathrm{sps}}$ of any stable photon sphere: $r_{\mathrm{sps}}<6M$, where $M$ is the asymptotic mass of the black hole. This bound is independent of specific black hole solutions and broadly applies to hairy black holes and other configurations with external matter fields meeting the stated energy conditions. Our results resolve fundamental questions regarding the existence and spatial constraints on stable photon orbits, with implications for gravitational lensing, accretion disk dynamics (e.g., the Aschenbach effect), and black hole shadow observations.

Thermodynamics of Kerr black hole: Tsallis-Cirto composition law and entropy quantization
G.E. Volovik

Subjects:
General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)
The processes of splitting and merging of black holes obey the composition law generated by the Tsallis-Cirto $\delta=2$ statistics. The same composition law expresses the full entropy of the Reissner-NordstrÃ¶m black hole via the entropies of its outer and inner horizons. He we apply this composition law to the entropy of the Kerr black hole. As distinct from Reissner-NordstrÃ¶m black hole, where the full entropy depends only on mass $M$ and does not depend on its charge $Q$, the entropy of Kerr black hole is the sum of contributions from its mass $M$ and angular momentum $J$, i.e. $S(M,J)=S(M,0) + 4\pi \sqrt{J(J+1)}$. Here $S(M,0)$ is the entropy of the Schwarzschild black hole. This demonstrates that when the Kerr black hole with $J\gg 1$ absorbs or emits a massless particle with spin $s_z=\pm 1/2$, its entropy changes by $|\Delta S| = 2\pi$. We also considered the quantization of entropy suggested by the toy model, in which the black hole thermodynamics is represented by the ensemble of the Planck-scale black holes -- Planckons.

Recent studies have shown that quantum gravity introduces important corrections to the process of spherically symmetric gravitational collapse expected from general relativity. In particular, instead of falling into a central singularity, the collapsing body undergoes a bounce and eventually exits its Schwarzschild radius, and this entire process of collapse and rebound can occur in a single asymptotic region. In this paper, particle creation during such non-singular gravitational collapse is studied. It is shown that the probability of spontaneous emission of particles differs from the well-known probability of Hawking radiation from classical gravitational collapse. It is argued that the different result implies a deviation from thermality. Some arguments are also adduced concerning how the Hawking process during non-singular dust collapse could potentially remove shell crossing singularities.

We present the first directed searches for long-transient and continuous gravitational waves from ultralight vector boson clouds around known black holes (BHs). We use LIGO data from the first part of the fourth LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run. The searches target two distinct types of BHs and use two new semicoherent methods: hidden Markov model (HMM) tracking for the remnant BHs of the mergers GW230814_230901 and GW231123_135430 (referred to as GW230814 and GW231123 in this study), and a dedicated method using the Band Sampled Data (BSD) framework for the galactic BH in the Cygnus X-1 binary system. Without finding evidence of a signal from vector bosons in the data, we estimate the mass range that can be constrained. For the HMM searches targeting the remnants from GW231123 and GW230814, we disfavor vector boson masses in the ranges $[0.94, 1.08]$ and $[2.75, 3.28] \times 10^{-13}$ eV, respectively, at 30% confidence, assuming a 1% false alarm probability. Although these searches are only marginally sensitive to signals from merger remnants at relatively large distances, future observations are expected to yield more stringent constraints with high confidence. For the BSD search targeting the BH in Cygnus X-1, we exclude vector boson masses in the range $[0.85, 1.59] \times 10^{-13}$ eV at 95% confidence, assuming an initial BH spin larger than 0.5.

Scalar Field Reconstructions of Holographic Dark Energy Models with Applications to Chaplygin Gas, DBI, Yang-Mills, and NLED Frameworks
Antonio Pasqua
Subjects:
General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
In this study, we investigate the cosmological implications of two DE models, introduced by Chen \& Jing \cite{modelhigher} and by Granda \& Oliveros \cite{gohnde}. The first model comprises three principal components: one term proportional to the Hubble parameter $ H$ squared, and two additional terms proportional to the first and second time derivatives of $ H $, respectively. The second model, known as New Holographic Dark Energy (NHDE) model, can be considered a generalization of the Ricci DE model and it contains a term proportional to the Hubble parameter $H$ squared and one to the first time derivative of $H$. We derive the analytical expressions for the reduced Hubble parameter squared $h^2$, the Equation of State (EoS) parameter of Dark Energy (DE) $\omega_D $, the pressure of DE $p_D$ and of the deceleration parameter $q $ considering both non-interacting and later on interacting DM and DE. We also consider some limiting cases for the integration constants obtained. Furthermore, we explore the limiting scenario of a flat, dark energy-dominated Universe and establish a correspondence between the proposed DE models and various scalar field frameworks. Specifically, we examine their connection with the Generalized Chaplygin Gas, the Modified Chaplygin Gas, the Modified Variable Chaplygin Gas, the Viscous Generalized Chaplygin Gas, as well as scalar field models based on Dirac-Born-Infeld theory, Yang-Mills theory and Nonlinear Electrodynamics.

Using spacetime Gaussian test functions, we find closed-form expressions for the smeared Wightman function, Feynman propagator, retarded and advanced Green's functions, causal propagator and symmetric propagator of a massless scalar field in the vacuum of Minkowski spacetime. We apply our results to localized quantum systems which interact with a quantum field in Gaussian spacetime regions and study different relativistic quantum information protocols. In the protocol of entanglement harvesting, we find a closed-form expression for the entanglement that can be acquired by probes which interact in Gaussian spacetime regions and obtain asymptotic results for the protocol. We also revisit the case of two gapless detectors and show that the detectors can become entangled if there is two-way signalling between their interaction regions, providing closed-form expressions for the detectors' final state.

We investigate binary neutron star (BNS) mergers using general-relativistic numerical simulations with hadronic and hybrid equations of state (EOSs), incorporating the latest observations and theoretical constraints. We address two viable scenarios for the transition to quark matter: a quark-hadron crossover (QHC) or a strong first-order phase transition (1PT). To distinguish between different models, we define neutron-quark stars (NQS) as configurations where quark effects emerge at masses below the lowest observed neutron-star mass. While traditional "hybrid stars" may be distinguished by purely hadronic configurations through mass-radius measurements, the mass-radius relations of NQSs resemble those of purely hadronic models, with no sharp boundary between hadrons and quarks. The name NQS effectively captures the absence of a phase boundary between hadrons and quarks in QHC scenarios. Our results indicate that QHC models can be distinguished from hadronic ones if both the inspiral and postmerger gravitational waves (GWs) are observed. In particular, the dominant postmerger frequency ($f_2$) tends to be lower than in hadronic models with the same tidal deformability ($\Lambda$). We also present the first general-relativistic simulations of BNS mergers where the stars already contain quark matter before merging. These involve a strong first-order phase transition (1PT) at 1.8 times nuclear saturation density, followed by a stiff quark EOS. Finally, we identify a robust linear correlation between the total GW energy emitted after the merger and the $f_2$ frequency. Remarkably, this relation holds regardless of the quark presence.

Quantum gravity with purely virtual particles from asymptotically local quantum field theory

We investigate the relationship between nonlocal and local quantum field theories, and search for a viable notion of "local limit" to relate the unitary models. In Euclidean space it is relatively easy to have nonlocal theories with well-behaved local limits. In Minkowski spacetime, instead, singular behaviors are generically expected. Relaxing some assumptions on the "form factors" considered in the literature, we identify a class of models that have regular local limits in Minkowski spacetime. We call the models "asymptotically local" quantum field theories (AL-QFTs) and show that their limits are theories with physical and purely virtual particles (PVPs). In the bubble diagram, the nonlocal deformation generates PVPs straightforwardly. In the triangle diagram, it does so possibly up to multi-threshold corrections, which may be adjusted by tuning the deformation itself. We also build an asymptotically local deformation of quantum gravity with purely virtual particles. AL-QFT can serve various purposes, such as suggesting innovative approaches to off-shell physics, providing an alternative formulation for theories with PVPs, or smoothing out nonanalytic behaviors. We discuss its inherent arbitrariness and the implications for renormalizability.

We study mathematical aspects concerning two site tree-level cosmological correlators with massive internal and external states in a de Sitter universe. We employ integration by parts identities, (relative) twisted cohomology and the method of differential equations. We explicitly express the internally massive, externally conformally coupled correlator as a power series with respect to a small mass parameter, where the various terms in the series are given by multiple polylogarithms.

$F(R)$ models for dark energy generally exhibit a weak curvature singularity, which can be cured by adding an $R^2$ term. This correction allows for a unified description of primordial and late-time accelerated expansions. However, most existing models struggle to achieve this, as they become unstable over certain negative ranges of the Ricci scalar, where either the first or second derivative of $F(R)$ turns negative. These instabilities may disrupt the post-inflationary evolution when the Ricci scalar oscillates about the vacuum state after the $R^2$ inflation. In this work, we introduce a new model-building to guarantee global stability, i.e., the first and second derivatives are positive for all real Ricci scalars. By extending the idea from Appleby and Battye, we demonstrate that viable models can be constructed by imposing a positive, bounded first derivative of $F(R)$ with a sigmoid shape. As examples, we first reformulate and generalize the original Appleby-Battye model. Then, we propose a new dark energy model, which successfully explains the acceleration of cosmic expansion and passes local gravity tests.

It is well known that the area of the de Sitter cosmological horizon is related to the entropy of the bulk spacetime. Recent work has however shown that the horizon encodes more information about the bulk spacetime than just the entropy. In this work, we show that the horizon contains all of the gauge invariant (diffeomorphism and $U(1)$) information about (static albeit unstable) configurations of charged and rotating objects placed deep inside the de Sitter spacetime. We study highly symmetric objects, such as dipoles and cubes, built of objects with electric charge and angular momentum at their vertices. We show how these configurations affect the geometry of the cosmological horizon and imprint detailed information about the objects in the bulk onto the cosmological horizon.

In the context of field theories with complex poles, we scrutinize four inequivalent ways of defining the scattering amplitudes, each forfeiting one or more tenets of standard quantum field theory while preserving the others: (i) a textbook Wick rotation by analytic continuation of the external momenta from Euclidean to Lorentzian signature (no optical theorem), (ii) the Lee--Wick--Nakanishi prescription, integrating along a certain contour in the complex energy plane (no Lorentz invariance), (iiii) the fakeon prescription, where, in addition, spatial momenta are integrated on a complex path defined by the locus of singularities of the loop integrand (no analyticity of the amplitude) and (iv) to work directly on Minkowski spacetime, which violates the optical theorem and also bars power-counting renormalizability. In general, mixed Euclidean-Lorentzian prescriptions for internal and external momenta in loop integrals break Lorentz invariance, regardless of the type of masses involved. We conclude that, of the above four options, only the fakeon prescription is physically viable and can have applications to quantum gravity.

We provide a derivation of the Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) formula in 3D gravity for generic boundary subregion--including RT surface phase transitions--directly from the dual two-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT). Our approach relies on the universal statistics of the algebraic conformal data and the large-$c$ behavior of conformal blocks with Cardy boundaries involved. We observe the emergence of 3D multi-boundary black holes with Karch-Randall branes from entangled states of any number of CFT's with and without Cardy boundaries. The RT formula is obtained directly from the CFT in the high-temperature regime. Two direct applications are: $\textbf{1)}$ A simple derivation of the multi-interval entanglement entropy for the vacuum state of a single CFT; $\textbf{2)}$ A CFT-based detection of the emergence of replica wormholes in the context of entanglement islands and black hole microstate counting. Our framework yields the first holographic random tensor network that faithfully captures the entanglement structure of holographic CFTs. These results imply that bulk spacetime geometries indeed emerge from the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) in the dual field theory in the large-$c$ limi--a paradigm we refer to as $\textit{It from ETH}$.

The generalized Lanczos algorithm can provide a universal method for constructing the wave function under the group structure of Hamiltonian. Based on this fact, we obtain an open two-mode squeezed state as the quantum origin for the curvature perturbation. In light of this wave function in the open system, we successfully develop a new method to calculate its corresponding power spectrum by using the Bogoliubov transformation. Unlike traditional approaches, we explicitly retain the Bogoliubov coefficients in terms of the squeezing amplitude \( r_k \) and the squeezing rotation angle \( \phi_k \). As a result, the power spectrum of the open two-mode squeezed state will match that of the Bunch-Davies vacuum numerically. Furthermore, the derivation of the open two-mode squeezed state relies on the second kind Meixner polynomial (equivalent to the generalized Lanczos algorithm) and the symmetry of the Hamiltonian. Therefore, our research may offer a new insight into the calculation of the correlation functions through a group-theoretic perspective.

We reinterpret Starobinsky's stochastic inflation as an open quantum system, where short-wavelength modes act as the environment for long-wavelength modes. Using the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, we systematically trace out the environment and derive an effective theory for the reduced density matrix, including deviations from exact de Sitter. The resulting master equation is a Lindblad equation, which reduces to a Fokker-Planck equation for the diagonal elements up to higher orders in the slow-roll expansion, while also yielding a more complete equation in phase space. Finally, we extend the formalism to global de Sitter, for which the associated Fokker-Planck equation lacks equilibrium solutions until the late-time regime $aH \gg 1$.

We investigate the connection between thermodynamic phase transitions and quasi-normal modes (QNMs) in charged black holes with a positive curvature constant, within the framework of $F(R)$-Euler-Heisenberg gravity. Nonlinear electromagnetic fields lead to rich thermodynamic phase structures and significantly affect the QNMs of massless scalar fields. By analyzing the QNMs spectrum, we find that the transition point marking the disappearance of the divergence in the QNMs slope parameter $K$ aligns with the change of the thermodynamic phase structure described by the heat capacity, within the bounds of computational uncertainty. This precise matching holds under variations of the curvature parameter and charge. Furthermore, we show that larger angular quantum number $l$ diminishes this correspondence, while higher overtone number $n$ restores it beyond a threshold. These findings demonstrate that thermodynamic phase transitions of black holes carry embedded dynamical information, uncovering a fundamental link between black hole thermodynamic and dynamical properties.

We discuss the generalisation of the Weyl double copy to higher spin "multi-copies", showing how the natural linearised higher spin field strengths can be related to sums of powers of the Maxwell tensor. The tracelessness of the field strength involves the appropriate Fronsdal equations of motion for the higher spin field. We work with spacetimes admitting Kerr-Schild coordinates and give a number of examples in different dimensions. We note that the multi-copy is particularly transparent in four dimensions if one uses spinor descriptions of the fields, relating this to the Penrose transform. The higher-dimensional spinor multicopy is also explored and reveals some interesting new features arising from the little group based identification of higher spin field strengths and Maxwell tensor types. We then turn to the vector superspace formalism describing higher spin and `continuous' spin representations given by Schuster and Toro, based on symmetric tensor fields. Here the Kerr-Schild higher spin fields we have used earlier naturally package into a simple expression involving an arbitrary function, when the continuous spin scale $\rho$ is set to zero. Further, we discuss the case of an anti-de Sitter background, where there is also a vector space formalism given by Segal and we clarify this approach using a different definition of the covariant derivative. We give a general solution of Kerr-Schild type and finally we describe some of the obstacles to a continuous spin formulation.

When 3D relative displacement $\mathbf{r}$ and velocity $\mathbf{v}$ between the pair in a gravitationally-bound system are precisely measured, the six measured quantities at one phase can allow elliptical orbit solutions at a given gravitational parameter $G$. Due to degeneracies between orbital-geometric parameters and $G$, individual Bayesian inferences and their statistical consolidation are needed to infer $G$ as recently suggested by a Bayesian 3D modeling algorithm. Here I present a fully general Bayesian algorithm suitable for wide binaries with two (almost) exact sky-projected relative positions (as in the Gaia data release 3) and the other four sufficiently precise quantities. Wide binaries meeting the requirements of the general algorithm to allow for its full potential are rare at present, largely because the measurement uncertainty of the line-of-sight (radial) separation is usually larger than the true separation. As a pilot study, the algorithm is applied to 32 Gaia binaries for which precise HARPS radial velocities are available. The value of $\Gamma \equiv \log_{10}\sqrt{G/G_{\rm N}}$ (where $G_{\rm N}$ is Newton's constant) is $-0.002_{-0.018}^{+0.012}$ supporting Newton for a combination of 24 binaries with Newtonian acceleration $g_{\rm N}>10^{-9}$m s$^{-2}$, while it is $\Gamma=0.063_{-0.047}^{+0.058}$ or $0.134_{-0.040}^{+0.050}$ for $7\text{ or }8$ binaries with $g_{\rm N}<10^{-9}$m s$^{-2}$ (depending on one system) showing tension with Newton. The Newtonian ``outlier'' is at the boundary set by the Newtonian escape velocity, but can be consistent with modified gravity. The pilot study demonstrates the potential of the algorithm in measuring gravity at low acceleration with future samples of wide binaries.

Quantum Vacuum energy as the origin of Gravity

We explore the idea that quantum vacuum energy $\rho_{\rm vac} $ is at the origin of Gravity as a theoretical exercise. We formulate a gravitational version of the electromagnetic Casimir effect, and provide an argument for how gravity can arise from $\rho_{\rm vac} $ by showing how Einstein's field equations emerge in the form of Friedmann's equations. This leads to the idea that Newton's constant $G_N$ is environmental, namely it depends on the total mass-energy of the Universe $M_\infty $ and its size $R_\infty $, with $G_N = c^2 R_\infty /2 M_\infty$. This leads to a new interpretation of the Gibbons-Hawking entropy of de Sitter space, and also the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy for black holes, wherein the quantum information bits are quantized massless particles at the horizon with wavelength $\lambda = 2 \pi R_\infty$. We assume a recently proposed formula for $\rho_{\rm vac} \sim m_z^4/\mathfrak{g}$, where $m_z$ is the mass of the lightest particle, and $\mathfrak{g}$ is a marginally irrelevant coupling. This leads to an effective, induced RG flow for Newton's constant $G_N$ as a function of an energy scale, which indicates that $G_N$ decreases at higher energies until it reaches a Landau pole at a minimal value of the cosmological scale factor $a(t) > a_{\rm min}$, thus avoiding the usual geometric singularity at $a=0$. The solution to the scale factor satisfies an interesting symmetry between the far past and far future due to $a(t) = a(-t + 2 t_{\rm min})$, where $a(t_{\rm min}) = a_{\rm min}$. We propose that this energy scale dependent $G_N$ can explain the Hubble tension and we thereby constrain the coupling constant $\mathfrak{g}$ and its renormalization group parameters. For the $\Lambda{\rm CDM}$ model we estimate $a_{\rm min} \approx e^{-1/\hat{b} }$ where $\hat{b} \approx 0.02$ based on the Hubble tension data.

Solar System Experiments in the Search for Dark Energy and Dark Matter

We reassess the realistic discovery reach of Solar System experiments for dark energy (DE) and dark matter (DM) and quantify their complementarity to dedicated cosmological probes, such as the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and Euclid mission. In scalar-tensor frameworks with universal conformal coupling A(\phi), screening (chameleon/symmetron, Vainshtein) suppresses fifth forces in deep Solar potentials, consistent with the gravitational-wave speed bound |c_T/c - 1| < 10^{-15}. We treat Solar-System tests as hypothesis-driven probes: we assemble quantitative guardrails (MICROSCOPE \eta, Cassini \gamma, LLR \dot G/G and SEP, ephemeris limits on \rho_DM and Yukawa \alpha(\lambda), and clock-network searches for ultralight DM), place them alongside current cosmology posteriors, and provide an explicit map from cosmology-level linear response (e.g., \mu_{lin,0}) to local residuals using the screening relations (thin-shell and Vainshtein). Guided by systematics-gated criteria, we outline a near-term program--solar-conjunction Shapiro-delay and Doppler/range tests, sustained millimeter-class LLR, global optical-clock links, refined ephemerides, and spaceborne atom interferometry (AIS)--with realistic sensitivities |\gamma-1|< (2-5) x 10^{-6} per conjunction, \eta_EEP ~ 10^{-16}-10^{-17} (AIS), |\dot{G}/G| < (1-3) x 10^{-14} yr^{-1} (near-term; with LLR next-gen stations and CCRs, few x 10^{-15}), a uniform ~2x tightening of AU-scale Yukawa/DM-density bounds, and (3-10)x gains in ultralight-DM couplings from clock networks. Primary discovery potential for late-time dark energy lies with multi-probe cosmology (geometry and growth), while a hypothesis-driven Solar System program supplies high-leverage falsification and selective discovery windows for dark matter with ultralight mediators or long-range forces.
