Title:
Segmentation of the spacecraft transfer problem through overdetermined and continuity constraints based on the Theory of Functional Connections
Allan Kardec de Almeida Junior
Subjects:
Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Dynamical Systems (math.DS)
This paper introduces a segmented approach for solving constrained orbit transfer problems. The segments are connected through continuity constraints under the Theory of Functional Connections (TFC) mathematical framework that performs linear functional interpolation. This approach is further enhanced by a general vector formulation, from where the constrained functional is derived considering also a set of linear overdetermined constraints. Since we constrain vector instead of coordinates, this methodology allows to apply TFC to multiple and complex constraints composed by any types of nonlinear components included. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method on Earth-to-Moon transfers, showing that this segmented approach achieves solutions with several orders of magnitude greater accuracy and efficiency in comparison with unsegmented orbit transfers.

In this study, we examined the nearby open clusters (OCs) Alessi 36 and Collinder 135. Their spatial proximity was assessed using photometric and astrometric data from \textit{Gaia} DR3. Likely member stars were identified based on a membership probability threshold ($P \geq 0.5$), yielding 230 members for Alessi 36 and 342 members for Collinder 135. The mean proper-motion components ($\mu_\alpha \cos\delta, \mu_\delta$) were determined as $(-9.681 \pm 0.072, 7.021 \pm 0.081)$ mas yr$^{-1}$ for Alessi 36 and $(-10.061 \pm 0.083, 6.256 \pm 0.095)$ mas yr$^{-1}$ for Collinder 135. The parallax-based distances ($d$) were found to be $278 \pm 7$ and $299 \pm 11$ pc, while their estimated ages ($t$) were $39 \pm 5$ and $36 \pm 5$ Myr for Alessi 36 and Collinder 135, respectively. The Galactic orbital analysis of Alessi 36 and Collinder 135 reveals nearly circular orbits with low eccentricities and minor fluctuations in their apogalactic and perigalactic distances. The maximum heights they attain above the Galactic plane are $0.035 \pm 0.001$ kpc for Alessi 36 and $0.074 \pm 0.003$ kpc for Collinder 135, supporting their classification as part of the young stellar disc population.

Title:
Stellar velocity distributions in binary-rich ultrafaint dwarf galaxies

Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)
Ultrafaint dwarf (UFD) galaxies are dominated by dark matter, the distribution of which may be inferred from the kinematics of that galaxy's stellar population. Star-by-star observations are available for the satellite UFD galaxies of the Milky Way, making them uniquely good laboratories in which to test cosmological predictions at the smallest scales. However, the kinematics of these galaxies are complicated by the presence of binary stars, which alter the stellar velocity distribution. In particular these binary stars increase the galaxy's stellar velocity dispersion, which is related to the total galactic mass by the virial theorem. Without correctly eliminating or accounting for binary stars we may therefore overestimate the masses of UFD galaxies or even confuse globular clusters for UFD galaxies. Here we write down the probability density function for the observed line-of-sight (LOS) velocity of a stellar population containing both visual and spectroscopic binary stars, which we then use to determine the effect of those binary stars on the observed LOS velocity dispersion. For the coldest UFD galaxies the fractional increase in LOS velocity dispersion is of order one and for the coldest globular clusters is of order 100. However, if the stellar initial mass function is bottom light, as it may be for UFD galaxies and globular clusters, then both of these values increase by half a dex.

We present a detailed radio study of the tidal disruption events (TDEs) AT 2020zso and AT 2021sdu. Both exhibit transient radio emission beginning shortly after optical discovery and persisting for several years. For AT 2020zso, we identify two distinct radio flares. The first arises soon after the optical peak, reaching a maximum $\sim1$ year post-discovery before fading. The second flare appears $\sim800$ days after discovery and results in the brief presence of two distinct components in the radio spectra, providing strong evidence for physically separate outflows. Both flares are consistent with non-relativistic outflows, with velocities $v\approx0.1-0.2c$ and energies $E\sim10^{49}$ erg, propagating through a Bondi-like circumnuclear medium. Our analysis supports a scenario in which the first outflow is accretion-driven, launched while the TDE disk is accreting at a relatively high Eddington fraction, whereas the second outflow is associated with a transition to an advection-dominated accretion flow. In contrast, the radio emission from AT 2021sdu is best explained by a slower ($v\approx0.03c$), less energetic outflow ($E\sim10^{48}$ erg), combined with diffuse, non-variable host emission that becomes dominant $\sim500$ days after discovery. Assuming free expansion, we infer an outflow launch date preceding the optical discovery date. This suggests that the outflow may originate from either the unbound stellar debris ejected during disruption or, alternatively, from a decelerating outflow. Our findings demonstrate the diversity of outflow properties in TDEs and highlight the observational challenges of interpreting late-time radio variability in the presence of host galaxy contamination.

JWST has revealed sulfur chemistry in giant exoplanet atmospheres, where molecules such as SO2 trace photochemistry, metallicity, and formation and migration. To ascertain the conditions that determine whether (or how much) SO2, H2S, and other sulfur-bearing species are present in exoplanet atmospheres, we present a grid of planetary atmospheres covering metallicities from 0.3-1000x Solar and temperatures from 250-2050 K. These models map out the 'SO2 shoreline,' the region of metallicity and irradiation for which SO2 may be sufficiently abundant to be detectable. SO2 is a sensitive indicator of metallicity; expected SO2 abundances also depend strongly on overall temperature and C/O ratio; the SO2 abundance depends surprisingly weakly on XUV irradiation, also weakly on Kzz (for Teq > 600 K), and is essentially independent of internal temperature. Despite its detection in a growing number of giant planets, SO2 is never the dominant sulfur-bearing molecule: depending on temperature and metallicity, H2S, S2, NS, SO, SH, and even S8 or atomic S are frequently as common (or more so) as SO2. Nonetheless SO2 remains the most easily detectable sulfur-bearing species, followed by H2S, though perhaps SO and SH could be detectable in some gas giants. Aside from a pressing need for additional observational constraints on sulfur, we also identify the need for future work to account for the effects of clouds and hazes, fully self-consistent atmospheric models, 2D and 3D models, a wider range of planetary masses and radii, and studies to measure and refine reaction rates and molecular opacities of sulfur-bearing species

The presence of nuclear discs in barred disc galaxies has been demonstrated in studies on stellar structures and kinematics. It is thus imperative to establish their fundamental properties and scaling relations, which can help understanding their connection to other central stellar structures, including nuclear star clusters. In this Letter, we use results from the structural analysis and star formation histories of a sample of galaxies with nuclear discs to show the distributions of fundamental parameters and scaling relations. Our analysis shows that the nuclear disc mass-size relation, and the relation between the nuclear disc mass and the stellar mass of its host galaxy, are - at face value - different from the corresponding relations for nuclear star clusters, but marginally compatible given the uncertainties. This sets constraints to scenarios in which their formation is connected. We also find that the nuclear disc in the Milky Way is on the shorter end of the distribution of sizes set by nuclear discs in other galaxies. This is the first analysis of this kind for kinematically confirmed nuclear discs, and further understanding of the properties of the nuclear disc in the Milky Way and other galaxies is necessary to corroborate these results.

We present new VLTI/GRAVITY astrometry and updated orbit fits for the directly imaged companions YSES 1 b and HR 2562 B, substellar objects straddling the planet-brown dwarf boundary. Using high-precision astrometry, radial velocity (RV) data, and proper motions, we derive revised orbital parameters with orbitize! arXiv:1910.01756. For YSES 1 b, the inclusion of GRAVITY astrometry and a relative radial velocity measurement from arXiv:2409.16660 overcomes the traditional challenge of constraining eccentricities for distant companions, enabling the first orbit fit and yielding a constrained eccentricity of 0.44 (0.20). This represents the first full orbit fit for the system. Additionally, we calculate a median line-of-sight stellar obliquity of 12 (+11, -8) degrees, providing further insight into the system's dynamical architecture. For HR 2562 B, our analysis agrees with arXiv:2302.04893, confirming a low-eccentricity orbit (0.34 (0.20)) and an inclination of 87 (1) degrees. We find HR 2562 B's orbit to be nearly coplanar with the debris disk, with a mutual inclination of 3.7 (0.3) degrees. For both YSES 1 b and HR 2562 B the lower eccentricities favor an in situ formation scenario over extreme scattering or cloud fragmentation.

The standard cosmological analysis with the Ly$\alpha$ forest relies on a continuum fitting procedure that suppresses information on large scales and distorts the three-dimensional correlation function on all scales. In this work, we present the first cosmological forecasts without continuum fitting distortion in the Ly$\alpha$ forest, focusing on the recovery of large-scale information. Using idealized synthetic data, we compare the constraining power of the full shape of the Ly$\alpha$ forest auto-correlation and its cross-correlation with quasars using the baseline continuum fitting analysis versus the true continuum. We find that knowledge of the true continuum enables a $\sim10\%$ reduction in uncertainties on the Alcock-Paczyński (AP) parameter and the matter density, $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$. We also explore the impact of large-scale information by extending the analysis up to separations of $240\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$ along and across the line of sight. The combination of these analysis choices can recover significant large-scale information, yielding up to a $\sim15\%$ improvement in AP constraints. This improvement is analogous to extending the Ly$\alpha$ forest survey area by $\sim40\%$.

Dust is essential to the evolution of galaxies and drives the formation of planetary systems. The challenge of inferring the origin of different presolar dust grains from meteoritic samples motivates forward modelling to understand the contributions of low- and high-mass stars to dust in our Solar System. In this work we follow the evolution of dust with tracer particles within a hydrodynamical simulation of a Milky Way-like isolated disc galaxy. We find that nearly half of the grains released from stars lose less than $10\%$ of their initial mass due to thermal sputtering in the interstellar medium (ISM), with an average degree of atomisation $\sim$$10\%$ higher for dust grains released by supernovae relative to asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star grains. We show through supernova remnant model variations that supernova (SN) dust survival is primarily shaped by the supernova bubble environment in the first million years (Myr) after the explosion rather than by its evolution during $10^2-10^3$ Myr in the ISM. The AGB/SN ratio of dust grains incorporated into newly formed stars approaches $0.8$ after a few hundred Myr of galactic evolution. Our analysis also shows that star-forming particles with short ($<$$10$ Myr) free-floating time-scales in the ISM are predominantly released from supernovae rather than AGB stars. This implies that the Solar System budget of short-lived radioactive isotopes such as $^{26}$Al, whose decay contributed to melting and differentiating planetesimals, should have been provided by massive stars with masses $M \gtrsim 8$ M$_{\odot}$.

We present pbhstat, a publicly available Python package designed to compute the mass function and total abundance of primordial black holes (PBHs) from a given primordial power spectrum. The package offers a modular framework using multiple statistical approaches, including Press-Schechter theory, peaks theory, and formalisms based on the non-linear compaction function. Currently, the implementation is limited to scenarios with nearly Gaussian initial conditions.

Cosmic rays (CRs), from active galactic nuclei (AGN) jets and supernovae (SNe), serve as a significant feedback mechanism influencing emission lines in narrow line region (NLR) clouds. These highly energetic particles, propelled by shocks, heat the interstellar medium (ISM) and modify its chemical composition. This study investigates the role of CRs, particularly in their ability to excite gas and align with observed line ratios across UV and optical diagnostics. We employ CLOUDY to explore CR ionization rate, ionization parameter, and initial hydrogen density effects on optical and mid-infrared (MIR) emission. Our analysis includes high-quality optical data from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) for NGC 5728, supplemented by infrared observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Our previous results indicate that CRs are instrumental in heating the inner regions of gas clouds, enhancing emission of low-ionization optical lines. Mid-infrared data reveal that emission lines like [Ar II] and [Ne II] within the JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) field of view are sensitive to CRs. In contrast, high-ionization lines (for example, [Ne V]) serve as robust tracers of photoionization insensitive to CRs. Moreover, mixed optical and MIR diagnostics offer insight into the relative roles of CRs and shocks, which often produce similar signatures in emission lines. We find that while both mechanisms can elevate certain line ratios, their influence on MIR diagnostics diverges: shocks and CRs affect low-ionization lines differently, allowing for a better understanding when multi-wavelength data are available. Our approach not only helps to resolve the degeneracy between metallicity and CR ionization but also enables the potential differentiation of shocks and CR-driven processes in AGN.

The Probe of Extreme Multi-Messenger Astrophysics Balloon with Radio mission (PBR) will point above Earth's limb to measure PeV energy cosmic rays, and record star images to monitor optical focusing in situ. PBR will point below Earth's limb to search for earth-skimming neutrinos. PBR will also measure EeV energy cosmic rays by tilting as far down as the nadir direction. All of these searches will require changing and measuring the tilt angle of a single large integrated telescope and radio antenna assembly in the near space environment at 33 km above sea level over a mission duration as long as 50 days. In addition, the 1.1 m diameter entrance pupil of the telescope will be covered during the day by a shutter system to prevent sunlight from damaging the camera systems and opened at night to collect data. Here we present the design and status of the tilting system, the tilting monitors, the shutter system, the controller, and the preflight thermal vacuum testing process. The work draws on the experience of the 2023 Extreme Universe Space Observatory on a Super Pressure Balloon 2 mission.

Interacting galaxy cluster pairs offer a unique opportunity to study the properties of the gas in the intracluster bridge connecting them. As a consequence of the encounter, both the X-ray and radio emission from the gas are expected to be enhanced by shocks and turbulence, facilitating their detection. PSZ2 G279.79+39.09 is likely an off-axis merging system at $z = 0.29$, with its two main components observed shortly after pericenter passage. In this paper, we investigate the presence of diffuse radio emission in this system. We observed the cluster pair with the MeerKAT UHF band (544-1088 MHz) for 7.5 h and uGMRT band 3 (300-500 MHz) for 8 h. These are the first targeted radio observations of this system. We discover diffuse synchrotron emission in the system, with indication of enhanced emission in the region bridging the cluster pair. The detection is based on MeerKAT UHF data, while uGMRT band 3 observations do not allow us to derive a stringent limit on the spectral index of the source. This emission is likely generated by the turbulence injected in the early stage after the cluster-cluster encounter. However, the study of its physical properties is limited by the current data. As other systems with multiple cluster components studied in recent years, this cluster pair represents an appealing target to probe nonthermal phenomena beyond the well-studied denser regions of the intracluster medium. While we report a new detection, our analysis highlights the need for multi-band observations to fully understand these sources.

We present the status and goals of the readout electronics system we are developing to support the detector arrays in the coronagraph instrument on the NASA Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) mission currently in development. HWO aims to revolutionize exoplanet exploration by performing direct imaging and spectroscopy of 25 or more habitable exoplanets, and to resolve a broad range of astrophysics science questions as well. Since exoplanet yield depends critically on the detector dark count rate, as we show in this paper, the ambitious goals of HWO require arrays of single-photon energy-resolving detectors. We argue that Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KIDs) are best suited to meet these requirements. To support the detectors required for HWO and future far-IR missions, at the required power consumption and detector count, we are developing a radiation-tolerant reconfigurable readout system for both imaging and energy-resolving single photon KID detector arrays. We leverage an existing RFSoC-based system we built for NASA balloons that has a power consumption of 30 Watts and reads out 2000-4000 detectors (i.e. 7-15 mW/pixel), and move to a radiation tolerant Kintex Ultrascale FPGA chip to bring low-power wide bandwidth readout to a space-qualified platform for the first time. This improves significantly over previous spaceflight systems, and delivers what is required for NASA's future needs: ~100,000 pixels with less than 1 kW total power consumption. Overall, the system we are developing is a significant step forward in capability, and retires many key risks for the Habitable Worlds Observatory mission.

A nova super-remnant (NSR) is a greatly-extended structure grown by repeated nova eruptions sweeping the surrounding material away from a nova into a dense outer shell and are predicted to form around all novae. To date, four NSRs are known, with three located in the Galaxy and one residing in M31. Here we present the discovery of the first NSR in the Large Magellanic Cloud and only the second extragalactic nova shell to be identified, hosted by the recurrent nova LMCN 1971-08a. The structure is coincident with the nova, has a circular morphology and is visible in narrowband H$\alpha$ and [S II] filters but very faint in [O III], as expected. HI data also potentially reveal the existence of a coincident structure. Further, with a diameter of ${\sim}200$ pc, this NSR is the largest example yet found, with models indicating an ${\sim}4130 \ \text{M}_{\odot}$ shell expanding at ${\sim}20 \ \text{km} \ \text{s}^{-1}$ into the surrounding medium and an age of $\sim$2.4 Myr. The existence of the NSR also suggests that LMCN 1971-08a may have a much shorter recurrence period than currently presumed.

Study of an Isolated Double-pulse Cosmic Ray Candidate Recorded with the Askaryan Radio Array

High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM)
The radio-frequency emissions produced by particle showers on Earth, resulting from cosmic rays (CRs) and ultra-high energy neutrinos (UHE-$\nu$) originating from astrophysical sources share significant similarities, enabling radio detectors initially designed for UHE-$\nu$ searches to also study CRs. The Askaryan Radio Array (ARA), an experiment currently operating within the ice at the South Pole, is primarily designed to detect UHE-$\nu$s. To date, ARA has deployed five stations, with each station equipped with antennas installed at depths up to 200 meters in the ice. Data recorded by ARA Station-2 (A2) suggest a potential CR origin for a subset of events identified in a UHE-$\nu$ search. This subset includes a double-pulse event potentially from a downward propagating CR-induced air shower, with in-air geomagnetic emission followed by in-ice Askaryan emission producing the two pulses. A detailed investigation of this CR candidate event using comprehensive simulations has been conducted with the goal of identifying the parameters of a CR-induced air shower that best match the experimentally observed quantities. We simulate predicted CR signals in ARA by combining an impacting CR shower simulation framework (FAERIE) with a realistic detector simulation (AraSim).
We determine the event topology based on the vertex reconstruction of both the putative geomagnetic and Askaryan signals. After inferring the event geometry, we show that the simulation matches the observed time structure of the event (channel-by-channel relative signal arrival times) for the recorded event.

Stars exhibit a range of variability periods that depend on their mass, age, and evolutionary stage. For space-based photometric data, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated success in recovering and measuring periodic variability from photometric missions like Kepler and TESS. All-sky ground-based surveys can have similar if not longer baselines than space-based missions, however these datasets are more challenging to work with due to irregular sampling, more complex systematics, and larger data gaps. In this work, we demonstrate that CNNs can be used to derive variability periods from ground-based surveys. From the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN) we recover 208,260 variability periods between 1-30 days, approximately 60% of which are new detections. We recover periods for active RSCVn, anomalous sub-subgiants, and cool dwarfs that are consistent with previously measured rotation periods, while periods for stars above the Kraft break are generally spurious. We also identify periodic signals in tens of thousands of giants stars which correspond to frequencies of stellar oscillations rather than rotation. Our results highlight that CNNs can be used on sparsely sampled ground-based photometry and may prove useful for upcoming observations from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST).

We performed a detailed analysis of the isotopologues with 13C, 34S, 33S, and 36S of the sulphur-bearing molecules CS, CCS, CCCS,HCS+, HCCS+, and H2CS towards TMC-1 using the QUIJOTE1. The observations were obtained with the Yebes radio telescope. Observations with the IRAM 30m of the most abundant isotopologues of these species are also presented and used to estimate volume densities and to constrain the excitation conditions. We report the first detection in space of C13C34S, CC33S, CCC33S, HC33S+, and HCC34S+. C36S is also detected for the first time in a cold object. We also complemented with maps that provide the spatial distribution of most of these species. Using the available collisional rate coefficients for each species, we modeled the observed line intensities using the large velocity gradient method for the radiative transfer. We report the most complete analysis of the column densities of the CnS family and to compare the abundance ratios of all detected isotopologues. Adopting a T_k for TMC-1 of 9K, we found that n(H2)=0.9-1.5X10^4cm-3 can explain the observed decline in intensity with increasing J. We derived the rot. constants for the C13C34S, CC33S, CCC33S, HC33S+, and HCC34S+ isotopologues from new laboratory data and complemented them with the frequencies of the observed lines. We find that all S isotopologues are consistent with solar isotopic abundance ratios. Accurate 12C/13C abundances were derived and, as previously suggested, the 13C isotopologues of CCS and CCCS show strong abundance anomalies depending on the position of the substituted carbon. Nevertheless, the 12C/13C abundance ratio is practically identical to the solar value for CS, HCS+, and H2CS. We also searched for the isotopologues of other S-bearing molecules. The expected intensities for their 34S and 13C isotopologues are too low to be detected with the present sensitivity of the QUIJOTE, however.

For the first time in nearly a decade, a new, bright transient was detected in the central parsec (pc) of the Galaxy. MAXI J1744-294 was never observed in outburst prior to January 2025. We present the results of a broadband, multi-wavelength study of this enigmatic source, including data from the NuSTAR, Chandra, XMM-Newton, Swift, and NICER X-ray telescopes, as well as complementary radio and near-infrared observations. We find that MAXI J1744-294 remained in the bright/soft state throughout the first months of 2025. Spectral hardening was observed in April 2025, followed by a decline in flux. Based on the spectral and temporal characteristics of the source, we identify MAXI J1744-294 as a candidate black hole (BH) low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) $-$ the fourth candidate BH transient discovered within a (projected) distance of one pc from the Galactic supermassive black hole Sgr A*. This discovery provides further evidence for a cusp of BH-LMXBs in the central pc of our Galaxy, as argued for in previous observational work and suggested by analytical and theoretical work. Our multi wavelength study, involving a complementary range of observatories and spanning different outburst states, can serve as a model for future time domain astrophysics research.

Deep JWST imaging of the massive galaxy cluster MACS0417.5-1154, at redshift z=0.443, reveals a huge population of globular clusters (GCs) and Ultra-Compact Dwarfs (UCDs) primarily distributed around its single central giant galaxy (BCG). We present NIRCam/SWC photometry of the GC system in four bands (F090W, F115W, F150W, F200W). The spatial distribution of the system matches well in radial and ellipticity profile with the high elongation (b/a = 0.5) of the BCG halo light. The total GC population within MACS0417 is estimated to be near 1.5 x 10^5, similar to the systems in Abell 2744, Coma, and other galaxy clusters with comparable masses. With similar results for GC photometry in hand from other lensing clusters at a range of redshifts, it is now possible to trace on purely observational grounds the luminosity evolution of GC systems over many Gigayears of lookback time, as seen through their color-magnitude diagrams. We show this sequence for five systems reaching to lookback times of more than 7 Gyr. A systematic change in the GC/UCD sequence with lookback time is clearly visible, near what is expected for age-fading of a simple stellar population with time. Lastly, we evaluate the effectiveness of the various JWST NIRCam filters for broadband photometry of GC systems as a function of redshift, as an aid to planning further studies.

Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)
We performed \textit{N}-body/SPH simulations of isolated spiral galaxies with various bulge-to-disk mass ratios ($M_{\rm bulge}/M_{\rm disk}$) from 0.02 to 0.2 to investigate mass transport from galactic scales (10 kpc) down to circumnuclear disk scales ($\lesssim$ 100 pc). Our analysis revealed these main findings, (1) Gravitational torque from stellar spiral arms causes gas accretion with $\sim1$ $M_\odot$ ${\rm yr}^{-1}$ along the gas spiral arms from a few kpc to a few 100 pc scale. The density of accreting gas is a few 100 ${\rm cm^{-3}}$, comparable to the gas arms. The pressure gradient force is over an order of magnitude weaker than the stellar gravitational torque. (2) Gravitational torque from barred structure causes episodic gas clump accretion with $\sim1$ $M_\odot$ ${\rm yr}^{-1}$ on timescales of 10 Myr from kpc to a few 100 pc scale. The densities of these clumps exceed 700 ${\rm cm^{-3}}$, and this accretion occurs along elliptical orbits with a delayed phase relative to the bar potential \citep{wada1994}. (3) Episodic gas clumpy accretion is important for galactic center instability, confirmed by $M_{\rm bulge}/M_{\rm disk}$ = 0.02 but not by $M_{\rm bulge}/M_{\rm disk}$ = 0.1 and 0.2. This difference occurs because in the bulge-dominated potentials, bar instability is suppressed, and rapid gas clumps accretion does not occur. These findings suggest that gas clump accretion events driven by bars could be a source of high-density gas to the galactic center of the spiral galaxy, potentially promoting temporary activity in the galactic center.

We report the first statistically significant detection of X-ray polarization from the high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB) 4U 1700-377, observed using the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). A polarization degree exceeding 10% was detected above 5 keV, placing it among the highest polarization observed in HMXBs to date. The observation was conducted over a full orbital period of the binary system, during which several sporadic and instantaneous flares were detected. We identify a clear correlation between the polarization degree and orbital phase, with the highest polarization occurring just before and after the eclipse, reaching over 20% for a few tens of ks. These results suggest that the scattering medium responsible for the observed polarization is spatially localized between the compact object and the O-type companion star, likely created by large-scale inhomogeneities in the stellar wind and its interaction with the compact star's emission. We also explore the roles of disk winds and orbital reflection in the observed polarization variability. While both mechanisms contribute to the polarization, the substantial increase in polarization before and after the eclipse cannot be fully explained by these models alone, suggesting that the involvement of additional factors. The properties of the X-ray polarization observed by IXPE provide new insights into the accretion processes, X-ray emission, and wind structure in 4U 1700-377, advancing our understanding of their complex environments and the nature of the compact objects within.

SPHEREx, a recently launched astronomy mission, detected a bright 1.083 micron emission feature in the commissioning data. The PI group attributed this feature to the He I 1.0833 micron triplet line. Here, I review the physics and aeronomy of this well-known line of atmospheric origin. SPHEREx is in a dawn-dusk sun-synchronous polar orbit, circling the earth nearly 15 times a day and observing close to the terminator plane. With a height of 650 km, SPHEREx is located in the upper thermosphere that is dominated by atomic oxygen and helium. The He I line is a result of resonance scattering of solar photons by metastable helium atoms. It appears that SPHEREx has the capacity to provide a rich dataset (global, daily, and 2-minute cadence) of column density of metastable helium in the upper thermosphere. As an example of this assertion, with data from just one orbit, the winter helium bulge was readily seen. Rapid variations in the column density of metastable helium is seen over the south pole which is probably due to spatial structure in the distribution of metastable helium as well as solar activity. Helium in the thermosphere is of considerable interest to operators of low-earth orbiting (LEO) satellites, since drag in the thermosphere is the primary cause of the decay of these satellites. SPHEREx, along with on-going ground-based studies (passive NIR spectroscopy, lidar, incoherent scatter radar), is poised to contribute to this topic.

The Compton camera is a gamma-ray imaging device developed in the 1970s. In the 1990s, the COMPTEL detector onboard the CGRO was the first to utilize a Compton camera for MeV all-sky survey observations. Recently, various Compton cameras have been developed using scintillators, semiconductors, and gas detectors, some of which are intended for future small satellite missions as well as medical applications. However, the image obtained by a Compton camera has strong artifacts owing to the overlap of the Compton cones or the arcs, which degrade the resolution and sensitivity of the image. In this study, we revisit the adaptive ARM cut that significantly reduces artifacts when the direction of gamma ray emitting source is already known. This approach complements the statistically well-defined method based on the response function in the three-dimensional data space of scattering direction (\chi, \psi) and scattering angle \theta, but it is more direct, intuitive, and simplifies the extraction of spectra in astronomical observations of point-like sources. Using a Compton camera, INSPIRE, onboard the ultra-small satellite GRAPHIUM as an example, we numerically evaluated the extent of background reduction to estimate simulation-based sensitivity. The method was also applied to actual measurements using a quarter-scale prototype of INSPIRE to extract spectra from multiple sources within the same field of view.

How do planetary systems, in general, and our own Solar System (SS), in particular, form? In conjunction, Astronomy and Isotope Cosmochemistry provide us with powerful tools to answer this age-old question. In this contribution, we review recent advances in our understanding of circumstellar disk evolution, including infall and disk processes, as explored through astrophysical models and nucleosynthetic isotope anomalies of SS materials.
Astronomically, filamentary structures and anisotropy are observed across the dynamic range of star formation and disk substructures are found to be ubiquitous, highlighting how star- and planet-forming environments are far more complex and dynamic than previously thought. Isotopically, two decades of investigation of nucleosynthetic anomalies in bulk meteorites and refractory inclusions have produced a rich dataset, revealing the existence of pervasive heterogeneity in the early SS, both at the large- (i.e., NC-CC dichotomy) and fine-scale (i.e., trends within the NC group). Using an updated data compilation, we review the systematics and emerging structures of these anomalies as a function of their nucleosynthetic origin. We present the two main families of models - inheritance vs. unmixing - that have been proposed to explain the origin of the observed isotope heterogeneities, and discuss their respective implications for cloud infall and thermal processing in the disk. We also discuss how the extension of nucleosynthetic anomaly analyses to other chondritic components (Ameboid Olivine Aggregates, chondrules, matrix) has started to yield insights into transport, processing and mixing of dust in the disk. Limitations, open questions and key avenues for future work are presented in closing.

High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE)
Accretion discs in strong gravity ubiquitously produce winds, seen as blueshifted absorption lines in the X-ray band of both stellar mass X-ray binaries (black holes and neutron stars), and supermassive black holes. Some of the most powerful winds (termed Eddington winds) are expected to arise from systems where radiation pressure is sufficient to unbind material from the inner disc ($L\gtrsim L_{\rm Edd}$). These winds should be extremely fast and carry a large amount of kinetic power, which, when associated with supermassive black holes, would make them a prime contender for the feedback mechanism linking the growth of those black holes with their host galaxies. Here we show the XRISM Resolve spectrum of the Galactic neutron star X-ray binary, GX 13+1, which reveals one of the densest winds ever seen in absorption lines. This Compton-thick wind significantly attenuates the flux, making it appear faint, although it is intrinsically more luminous than usual ($L\gtrsim L_{\rm Edd}$). However, the wind is extremely slow, more consistent with the predictions of thermal-radiative winds launched by X-ray irradiation of the outer disc, than with the expected Eddington wind driven by radiation pressure from the inner disc. This puts new constraints on the origin of winds from bright accretion flows in binaries, but also highlights the very different origin required for the ultrafast ($v\sim 0.3c$) winds seen in recent Resolve observations of a supermassive black hole at similarly high Eddington ratio.

Planetary nebulae are sites where ejected stellar material evolves into complex molecules, but the precise physical conditions and chemical routes that govern these processes are unclear. The presence of abundant carbon-rich molecules in O-rich environments poses particular challenges. Here we report the first detection of methyl cation (CH3+) in any planetary nebula, observed in the O-rich nebula NGC 6302 using JWST MIRI/MRS observations. CH3+ is a key driver of organic chemistry in UV-irradiated environments. Spatially resolved observations reveal that CH3+ is co-located with 12CO, H2, H II, HCO+, and Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). LTE modelling of the CH3+ emission yields excitation temperatures of 500-800K in the inner bubble and torus, rising to 1000-2000K in the outer bubble of NGC 6302, with column densities ranging from ~10^11 to 10^13 cm^-2. This detection demonstrates that hydrocarbon radical chemistry must be incorporated into planetary nebulae chemical models. Further near-IR observations are crucial to map different chemical networks operating in these environments.

The effect of collisional cooling of energetic electrons on radio emission from the centrifugal magnetospheres of magnetic hot stars

This paper extends our previous study of gyro-emission by energetic electrons in the magnetospheres of rapidly rotating, magnetic massive stars, through a quantitative analysis of the role of Coulomb collisions with thermal electrons from stellar wind material trapped within the centrifugal magnetosphere (CM). For a dipolar field with aligned magnetic and rotational axes, we show that both gyro-cooling along magnetic loops and Coulomb cooling in the CM layer have nearly the same dependence on the magnitude and radial variation of magnetic field, implying that their ratio is a global parameter that is largely independent of the field. Analytic analysis shows that, for electrons introduced near the CM layer around a magnetic loop apex, collisional cooling is more important for electrons with high pitch angle, while more field-aligned electrons cool by gyro-emission near their mirror point close to the loop base. Numerical models that assume a gyrotropic initial deposition with a gaussian distribution in both radius and loop co-latitude show the residual gyro-emission is generally strongest near the loop base, with highly relativistic electrons suffering much lower collisional losses than lower-energy electrons that are only mildly relativistic. Finally, we briefly discuss the potential applicability of this formalism to magnetic ultracool dwarfs, for which VLBI observations indicate incoherent radio emission to be concentrated around the magnetic equator, in contrast to our predictions here for magnetic hot stars. We suggest that this difference could be attributed to either a lower ambient density of thermal electrons, or more highly relativistic non-thermal electrons, both of which would reduce the relative importance of the collisional cooling explored here.

The blazar TXS 0506+056 has been suggested to be a potential high-energy neutrino source thanks to the observations of IceCube, which found outburst-like neutrino emissions during 2014-2015 and 2017 in the transient emission search, and a $3.5\sigma$ local significance in a 10-year time-integrated search. The conventional one-zone jet model cannot explain the observed neutrino flux during outbursts due to the constraint from the X-ray flux, leading to proposals of multi-zone models (e.g. two-zone model) with multiple radiation zones. In literature, it has been shown that multi-zone models may consistently explain the high-state neutrino emission and the multi-wavelength emission of TXS 0506+056, while the quasi-steady-state long-term emission has not been well studied. In this work, we investigate a physically based model for the quasi-steady-state neutrino and electromagnetic radiation under the same framework, and successfully reproduce the multi-messenger emission of TXS 0506+056.

In this study, we investigate the chemical enrichment and structural evolution of the isolated elliptical relic galaxy Mrk1216 through X-ray observations. As a red-nugget relic, Mrk1216 provides a rare window into the early Universe, owing to its minimal interaction with the surrounding environment. Using data from the XMM-Newton telescope, we model the X-ray emission of its interstellar medium to derive radial temperature and abundance profiles. We find that the central region exhibits an elevated [Mg/Fe] ratio compared to typical early-type galaxies, consistent with a brief but intense star formation episode during its early assembly-a hallmark of relic systems. The nearly flat SNIa ratio profile ($R_{Ia} \sim 0.17$) extending to $\sim0.42R_{500}$ supports an early-enrichment scenario. These results highlight the importance of relic galaxies as benchmarks for studying early galaxy evolution and chemical enrichment. Future high-resolution missions and more advanced theoretical models incorporating more realistic initial mass functions are needed to fully assess their implications.

Relatively blue light extends beyond a spiral disk from a radius of ~5 kpc out to ~14 kpc from the center of NGC 1275. Analyses of its spectrum and broadband colors reveal a population of young stars having sub-solar metallicities superposed on a dominant population of old stars having super-solar metallicities. The young stars have a characteristic age of ~160 Myr and may span ages of a few hundred Myr, similar to that of stars comprising the central spiral disk, and a total mass about one-third that of this disk for a combined stellar mass (at birth) of ~4 $\times$ 10$^9$ $\rm M_\odot$. A multitude of arc-like features embedded in the extended blue light have brightnesses comparable to the somewhat older (~500 Myr) super star clusters (SSCs) projected against the central spiral disk. The SSCs have a relatively shallow mass function, suggesting that the tidal disruption of an initially larger population that we estimate could have had an initial total mass (far) exceeding ~1 $\times$ 10$^9$ $\rm M_\odot$ gave rise to the extended blue light -- the arc-like features corresponding to stellar streams tracing disrupted star clusters -- and perhaps also the central spiral disk. We speculate that, beginning about 500 Myr ago, an enhanced episode of AGN activity in NGC 1275, leaving still visible X-ray bubbles, induced vigorous cooling of the intracluster medium to fuel the formation of numerous star clusters: many were tidally disrupted to leave bluish light at the inner region of this galaxy, with the survivors being the SSCs projected against the central spiral disk.

Interstellar dust plays a central role in the evolution of galaxies by shaping star formation, altering observed stellar properties, and redistributing radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum. In the Milky Way, dust is concentrated in the Galactic disk and often associated with large-scale structures such as spiral arms and molecular clouds. Here we present a detailed analysis of the vertical distribution and substructure of interstellar dust using a sample of approximately 23 million stars from literature with high-precision extinction measurements. We derive three-dimensional dust density profiles along various sightlines and fit vertical dust distributions using both single and double exponential disk models across 12 Galactocentric radial bins from $\sim$6 to $\sim$12\,kpc. We show that a two-component disk model--comprising a ``thin'' and a ``thick'' dust disk--provides a better fit to the vertical dust profile than a single exponential disk, as indicated by Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) comparisons. The thin and thick disks have average scale heights of $81.0 \pm 6.7$\,pc and $152.0 \pm 7.0$\,pc, respectively. Our results also identify significant dust substructures, which align well with known spiral arms, molecular clouds, and star-forming regions.

The Multi-Channel Imager (MCI) is a powerful near-ultraviolet (NUV) and visible imager onboard the Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST). The MCI provides three imaging channels, which are the NUV channel, the Optical-blue channel and the Optical-red channel, with the wavelength range of 255-430 nm, 430-700 nm, and 700-1000 nm, respectively. The three channels can target the same field simultaneously. Each channel employs a CCD focal plane of 9216 x 9232 pixels and $\sim$7.5 x 7.5 arcmin$^2$ field of view. The MCI's three channels feature unprecedented sensitivities and field of views, as well as rich filter sets, which complements the NUV and visible capabilities of the CSST for the high-precision photometry, the weak-signal detection, and the related sciences. Here we present key design features, results of current ground tests, and suggested observing strategies of the MCI.

The Production Mechanism of the High-energy Emission Line in the Brightest Cosmic Burst

High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE)
As a characteristic feature of the spectrum, the emission line carries critical information on the underlying physics of the radiation. After extensive efforts in decades, the first high-significant detection of a series of emission lines evolving from 37 MeV to 6 MeV has been detected in the ever-bright gamma-ray burst GRB 221009A. However, the physical mechanism of the entire evolutionary trend of the lines remains elusive. To provide a self-consistent interpretation, we propose a novel scenario in which the photons of the line undergo a radiation transfer process called down-Comptonization after generation by the electron--positron pair annihilation. By incorporating the gamma-ray burst dynamical evolution, we systematically reproduce the observed evolution of the central energy, width, and flux of the emission line and further impose stringent constraints on the production of high-energy emission lines in general. Our study provides a new direction to the research of extreme cosmic bursts.

Probing initial isocurvature perturbation with 21cm one-point statistics

Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO)
Isocurvature perturbations expected from multi-field inflation models can leave unique signatures in the early Universe, but remain weakly constrained, especially on small scales. In this work, we investigate the constraining power of one-point statistics (variance and skewness) of the 21cm brightness temperature during Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionization, using semi-numerical simulations from 21cmFAST. We model both adiabatic and cold dark matter isocurvature modes, exploring their impact on the matter power spectrum, the timing of structure formation, and the evolution of neutral hydrogen. By varying astrophysical parameters as well as isocurvature fraction and spectral index, we quantify their respective effects on the 21cm power spectrum and on one-point statistics. Our results show that while variance is highly sensitive to the timing of cosmic events and provides tight constraints on isocurvature parameters, skewness is more strongly affected by astrophysical uncertainties and observational noise. Incorporating realistic instrumental noise based on SKA configurations, we perform a Fisher analysis and demonstrate that 21cm variance measurements can constrain the isocurvature fraction down to the sub-percent level, though a strong degeneracy with the spectral index remains. We discuss the importance of complementary probes, such as the 21cm forest and galaxy surveys, to break these parameter degeneracies. Our findings highlight the power of 21cm one-point statistics as robust and independent tools for probing early-Universe physics beyond what is accessible with traditional power spectrum analyses.

We investigate the effects of Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) on photon interactions, considering both intergalactic propagation (Breit-Wheeler process) and atmospheric interactions (Bethe-Heitler process). By incorporating LIV into the theoretical framework, we analyze how it modifies key quantities such as the cross section, threshold energy, and mean free path of photons traveling through intergalactic space. In addition, we study its impact on extensive air showers initiated by high-energy photons, demonstrating that LIV can alter the cross section of the primary interaction in the atmosphere. Additionally, we also test the photon interactions in the Earth crust, to evaluate if they can induce upward-going showers. Our results highlight the necessity of accounting for both propagation effects in intergalactic space and interactions in the atmosphere when evaluating LIV signatures. Even small deviations from Lorentz invariance can lead to measurable changes in astroparticle propagation and photon dynamics, offering new opportunities to test quantum gravity theories through high-energy astrophysical observations.

Diffuse emission in gamma-rays and neutrinos are produced by the interaction of cosmic rays with the interstellar medium. Below some hundreds of TeV, the sources of these cosmic rays are most likely Galactic. Hence, observations of high-energy gamma-rays and neutrinos can be used to probe the flux of cosmic rays in other parts of the Galaxy. Supernova remnants are usually considered as the prime candidate for the acceleration of Galactic cosmic rays. They inject cosmic rays in a point-like and specific time-dependent manner. As the precise positions and ages of the sources are not known, predictions must be obtained in a stochastic model. At GeV energies, the distribution of sources can be approximated with a smoothly varying spatial and temporal source density. At hundreds of TeV, however, the point-like nature matters as less sources contribute effectively due to shorter escape times. We have modelled diffuse emissions at hundreds of TeV, relevant for measurements by LHAASO, Tibet AS-gamma, IceCube, and the upcoming SWGO, as well as at tens of GeV, as measured by Fermi-LAT. This reveals the distinctive nature of diffuse emissions at the respective energies which can likely be used to constrain source models and locate cosmic ray sources.

Sub-Neptunes are absent in the Solar System, yet they are commonly found in our Galaxy. They challenge the internal structure models and prompt investigation on their formation, evolution, and atmospheres. We report the characterisation of new sub-Neptunes orbiting two similar M dwarfs, TOI-521 (T_eff=3544 K), and TOI-912 (T_eff=3572 K). Both stars host a candidate identified by TESS and are part of the THIRSTEE follow-up program, which aims at understanding the sub-Neptune population through precise characterisation studies on a population level. We analysed light curves, ground-based photometry and ESPRESSO, HARPS and IRD RVs to infer precise orbital and physical parameters. The two stars host nearly identical planets in terms of mass and radius. TOI-521 b is a transiting sub-Neptune in a 1.5-d orbit with radius and mass of R=1.98+/-0.14 R_e and M=5.3+/-1.0 M_e respectively. Moreover, we identified an additional candidate at 20.3 d, with a minimum mass of Msini=10.7+/-2.4 M_e currently not detected to transit. Similarly, TOI-912 b is a 4.7-d sub-Neptune with R=1.93+/-0.13 R_e and M=5.1+/-0.5 M_e. Interestingly, TOI-912 b likely has an unusually high eccentricity (e=0.58+/-0.02), and it is probably undergoing strong tidal dissipation. If such eccentricity is confirmed, it would make it one of the most eccentric sub-Neptunes known to date. TOI-521 b and TOI-912 b have very similar densities (4 g/cm^3) and they lie in the degenerate region of the mass-radius diagram where different compositions are plausible, including a volatile-rich composition, or a rocky core surrounded by a H-He envelope. Our sample supports the division of sub-Neptunes into two distinct populations divided by a density gap. Both planets are interesting targets for atmospheric follow-up in the context of understanding the temperature-atmospheric feature trend that starts to emerge thanks to JWST observations.

Population III (or Pop. III) stars, the first stellar generation built up from metal-free primordial gas, first started to form at redshifts z ~ 30. They formed primarily in small dark matter halos with masses of a few million solar masses. The cooling of the gas in these halos was dominated on all scales by molecular hydrogen. Current theoretical models indicate that Pop. III stars typically formed in small clusters with a logarithmically flat mass function due to widespread fragmentation in the protostellar accretion disks around these primordial stars. Massive Pop. III stars are thought to have played a pivotal role in shaping the early Universe, as their feedback regulates subsequent star formation, although the immediate effects of this feedback remain uncertain. Direct detection of Pop. III stars is challenging, but our chances of detecting at least a few Pop. III supernovae within the next decade are brighter. Indirect approaches based on stellar archaeology or gravitational wave detections offer promising constraints. Current observations suggest that most massive Pop. III stars ended their lives as core-collapse supernovae rather than pair-instability supernovae, offering insight into the initial mass function and evolutionary pathways of these primordial stars.

Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) can have multiple consequences on very-high energy gamma rays' emission, propagation, and detection, such as energy-dependent photon group velocity, photon instability, vacuum birefringence, and modified electromagnetic interaction. Depending on the underlying theoretical model, several of these effects can coexist. Nevertheless, in experimental tests of LIV, each effect is tested separately and independently. Here, we are performing a search for traces of several coexisting effects in a single analysis. We present our analysis method based on artificial neural networks and put our very first results in the context of experimental searches for LIV.

The chemical composition of diffuse interstellar clouds is not fully established. They host an active chemistry despite their relatively low density and the ubiquitous presence of far-UV radiation. To further explore the chemical composition of diffuse clouds, we performed a spectral scan toward the bright radio source BL Lac in the Q band (from 32 to 50 GHz) using the Yebes 40m telescope. Yebes observations were performed interleaving Frequency Switching and Position Switching integrations toward BL Lac, using a spectral resolution of 38 kHz. The data have been reduced with the CLASS software. We achieved an unprecedented sensitivity on the continuum of 0.02 - 0.07 %, allowing the detection of very faint absorption features. We confirm previous detections of HCS+, C3H, C3H+, CH3CN and HC3N in diffuse clouds and report new detections of CCS, C4H, CH3CHO, H2CCO , HNCO and H2CS along the line of sight to BL Lac, with abundances relative to H2 from a few 10{-11} to a few 10{-10}. We compiled molecular detections toward diffuse clouds to obtain the chemical inventory of a typical diffuse interstellar cloud. The chemical inventory of diffuse interstellar clouds includes complex organic species with up to four heavy atoms. These species are efficiently formed in the diffuse interstellar gas and reach abundances similar to those measured in dense photodissociation regions, pointing to similar gas phase chemical processes.

We present a scalar-field formulation of the generalized Chaplygin gas (GCG) and modified Chaplygin gas (MCG) models, in which the cosmic fluid dynamics are reproduced by canonical Lagrangians with analytically derived energy density $\rho(\phi)$, pressure $p(\phi)$, and scalar potential $V(\phi)$. This framework provides a unified description of dark matter and dark energy, transitioning naturally from a matter-dominated phase at early times to a negative-pressure dark-energy phase at late times. In this scalar-field formulation, the GCG and MCG models are naturally applicable to both theoretical analyses and numerical simulations. Extending this approach, we develop a systematic method to obtain a class of integrable scalar-field cosmological models. In this study, we use this method to construct a new scalar-field altered Chaplygin gas (ACG) model. To investigate the viability of Chaplygin-type models, we perform a likelihood analysis using the Pantheon+ Type Ia supernova compilation together with Cepheid-calibrated distances. We examine four models, $\Lambda$CDM, GCG, MCG, and ACG, obtaining posterior constraints on the Hubble constant $H_0$, the present-day effective equation of state $\omega_0$, the transition redshift $z^\star$, and the cosmic age $t_0$. With the Cepheid calibration fixing the absolute distance scale, the inferred $H_{0}$ remains nearly model-independent. The Chaplygin-type models predict an earlier onset of cosmic acceleration than $\Lambda$CDM and give a broader range for the inferred age of the Universe, reflecting their greater flexibility in late-time expansion histories. Among them, the ACG model provides tighter parameter constraints, while the GCG and MCG models produce broader posteriors due to parameter degeneracies.

High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE)
Supernova remnants (SNRs) are widely recognized as key accelerators of Galactic cosmic rays (CRs), supported by the detection of the characteristic pion bump in the gamma-ray spectra of several SNRs. However, the recent observation of ultra-high-energy (UHE, greater than 100 TeV) gamma-rays by LHAASO from sources such as W51 region challenges standard models, which predict CR acceleration up to PeV energies only during the early (~ 100 year) phase of SNR evolution. Given the older age of known SNRs, alternative mechanisms - such as the interaction of runaway CRs with nearby molecular clouds (MCs) - have been proposed to explain the persistent UHE emission. In this study, we focus on the W51 complex, particularly the W51C-B region, as a promising site for investigating SNR-MC interactions. Simulated observations with the CTAO and the ASTRI Mini-Array are presented to demonstrate their crucial role in bridging the energy gap between Fermi-LAT and LHAASO, especially in the 0.3-100 TeV range. Their improved angular resolution will also help disentangle emission components from the interaction zone and nearby sources. Our theoretical modelling suggests that accelerated particles at the shock can account for the radio and GeV data, while UHE emission could be best explained by the combined contribution from both acceleration and adiabatic compression of cloud material at the SNR-MC interface.

Characterizing the geometry of an object orbiting around a star from its transit light curve is a powerful tool to uncover various complex phenomena. This problem is inherently ill-posed, since similar or identical light curves can be produced by multiple different shapes. In this study, we investigate the extent to which the features of a shape can be embedded in a transit light curve. We generate a library of two-dimensional random shapes and simulate their transit light curves with light curve simulator, Yuti. Each shape is decomposed into a series of elliptical components expressed in the form of Fourier coefficients that adds increasingly diminishing perturbations to an ideal ellipse. We train deep neural networks to predict these Fourier coefficients directly from simulated light curves. Our results demonstrate that the neural network can successfully reconstruct the low-order ellipses, which describe overall shape, orientation and large-scale perturbations. For higher order ellipses the scale is successfully determined but the inference of eccentricity and orientation is limited, demonstrating the extent of shape information in the light curve. We explore the impact of non-convex shape features in reconstruction, and show its dependence on shape orientation. The level of reconstruction achieved by the neural network underscores the utility of using light curves as a means to extract geometric information from transiting systems.

High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE)
Context: The detection of the highest energy neutrino observed to date by KM3NeT, with an estimated energy of 220 PeV, opens up new possibilities for the study and identification of the astrophysical sources responsible for a diffuse flux of such ultra-high-energy neutrinos, among which gamma-ray bursts are longstanding candidates.
Aims: Based on the event KM3-230213A, we derive constraints on the baryon loading and density of the surrounding environment in models of blastwaves in long-duration gamma-ray bursts.
Methods: We compute the diffuse flux from gamma-ray burst blastwaves, either expanding in a constant density interstellar medium or developing in a radially decreasing density of a wind-like environment surrounding the gamma-ray burst progenitor star, by taking into account the expected neutrino spectra and luminosity function. We use a Poisson likelihood method to constrain the blastwave model parameters by calculating the expected number of neutrino events within the 90% confidence level energy range of KM3-230213A and by using the joint exposure of KM3NeT/ARCA, IceCube and Pierre Auger.
Results: We constrain the baryon loading to be $\leq \{392, 131, 39, 13\}$ at 90% confidence level, which is inversely proportional to a varying interstellar medium particle density of $\{1, 3, 10, 30\}$ cm$^{-3}$. In the wind-like environment case, the baryon loading is $\leq \{20, 50, 100\}$ at 90% confidence level, which is proportional to the sixth power of a varying density parameter of $\{0.05, 0.06, 0.07\}$.

Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
This thesis explores experimental and theoretical approaches to dark matter detection, from gas-based detectors to quantum sensors, tackling the challenge of identifying dark matter, which makes up 27% of the Universe's energy. It reviews astrophysical and cosmological evidence, highlights the Standard Model's limitations, and motivates searches for WIMPs, axions, and dark photons through direct, indirect, and collider-based strategies.
The experimental work includes the Micromegas-based TREX-DM experiment for low-mass WIMPs, with studies of argon and neon-based gas mixtures, detector design, shielding, readout, and background suppression. GEM integration boosted gain by up to 45. A UV LED-based internal calibration system was developed for compact, low-background operation, while pressure-dependent gain studies optimized future low-background TPCs. The thesis also advances axion and dark photon searches via haloscopes and introduces the DarkQuantum prototype, a superconducting qubit coupled to microwave cavities for single-photon detection. This system enabled the most stringent exclusion limit on massive dark photon interactions at 5.051 GHz, demonstrating the feasibility of quantum-enhanced detectors.
Overall, the work bridges classical and quantum detection techniques, advancing WIMP searches and pioneering compact quantum sensors for axion and dark photon detection, laying the foundation for future high-sensitivity dark matter experiments.

We present a spectroscopic and photometric study of HIP12653 to investigate its magnetic cycle and differential rotation. Using HARPS archival spectra matched with MARCS-AMBER theoretical templates, we derive the stellar parameters (Teff, logg, FeH, and vsini) of the target. The S-index, an activity indicator based on the emission of the CaII H&K lines, is fitted to determine the magnetic cycle and rotation periods. We refine the magnetic cycle period to 5799.20 \pm 0.88 d and suggest the existence of a secondary, shorter cycle of 674.6922 \pm 0.0098 d, making HIP12653 the youngest star known to exhibit such a short activity cycle. During the minimum activity phase, a rotation period of 4.8 d is estimated. This is notably different from the 7-day period obtained when measurements during minimum activity are excluded, suggesting that these two periods are rotation periods at different latitudes. To explore this hypothesis, we introduce a novel light curve fitting method that incorporates multiple harmonics to model different spot configurations. Applied to synthetic light curves, the method recovers at least two rotation periods close to the true input values in 92.1% of cases. The inferred rotation shear shows a median deviation of 0.0011 \pm 0.0003 and a standard deviation of 0.0177 \pm 0.0002 from the true value. Applying this approach to TESS photometric data from 2018 to 2023, we detect three distinct rotation periods, 4.8 d, 5.7 d, and 7.7 d, (along with a signal at 3.75 d interpreted as its first harmonic), consistent with spots located at different latitudes. Assuming a solar-like differential rotation, we estimate an inclination of 34.0 \pm 1.8^\circ and a rotational shear of \alpha = 0.38 \pm 0.01. These results confirm the 4.8-d period and demonstrate that differential rotation can be constrained by tracking rotation period changes across different phases of the magnetic cycle.

Radial pulsation runaway in massive red supergiants in late evolutionary stage and implications to hydrogen-rich supernovae

Performing a series of hydrodynamic stellar evolutionary simulations with \textsc{Mesa} (Module for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics), we investigate the excitation and growth of radial pulsations of massive red supergiants (RSGs) with the initial mass range of $M_\mathrm{ini}=13$--$18\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$. We show that strong radial pulsations develop in the hydrogen-rich envelope in their late evolutionary stages, and eventually the surface radial velocity exceeds the escape velocity for higher-mass models. On the other hand, lower-mass models exhibit more moderate pulsations with finite velocity amplitudes and are expected to keep massive hydrogen-rich envelopes when they evolve toward the gravitational collapse of the iron core. While the latter group ends up as a familiar transient population of exploding RSGs, i.e., type IIP supernovae (SNe), the former group may expel a part of their envelopes and explode as different transients population. We investigate how the energy of the oscillating envelope is dissipated and released as radiation. We also empirically determine the condition for the pulsation-driven mass ejection in terms of the luminosity-to-mass ratio, $L/M>10^{3.9}\mathrm{L}_\odot/\mathrm{M}_\odot$. The corresponding luminosity threshold for the explored mass range may explain the observationally inferred constraints on type IIP SN progenitors.

Globular clusters (GCs) are dense star clusters found in all massive galaxies. Recent work has established that they follow a tight relation between their internal stellar velocity dispersion $\sigma$ and luminosity, enabling accurate distance measurements. In this work, we aim to apply this GC velocity dispersion (GCVD) distance method to measure the distance to M 104 (NGC 4594, the Sombrero galaxy). We have measured internal stellar velocity dispersions for 85 globular clusters (GCs) and one ultra-compact dwarf galaxy around M 104 using high-resolution multi-object integrated-light spectroscopy with FLAMES/GIRAFFE on the Very Large Telescope. The measured velocity dispersions range from $\sigma = 4 - 30$ km s$^{-1}$, with a mean uncertainty of $\Delta\sigma = 2.5$ km s$^{-1}$. For a subset of 77 GCs with $V$-band magnitudes and reliable velocity dispersion measurements above $\sigma > 4$ km s$^{-1}$, we constructed the $M_V$-$\sigma$ relation to measure the distance to M 104, finding $D=9.00\pm0.29$ (stat.) $\pm0.26$ (sys.) Mpc. The GCs follow the Milky Way and M 31 $M_V-\sigma$ relation closely, with the exception of the luminous ultra-compact dwarf SUCD1, which is nearly one magnitude brighter than the mean relation. 29 GCs in the sample have sizes determined from Hubble Space Telescope imaging which allowed us to determine their masses and $V$-band dynamical mass-to-light ratios (M/L$_V$). We find a mean $<M/L_V> = 2.6 \pm 0.8 M_{\odot}/L_{\odot}$ for the luminous ($M_V < -8$ mag) M 104 GCs, which is higher than the Milky Way GCs, but is reminiscent of the brightest GCs in Centaurus A. With the exception of SUCD1, the GCs of M 104 follow the GCVD relation irrespective of their mass-to-light ratio.

The Pierre Auger Observatory has recently undergone a major upgrade, called AugerPrime, tailored to answer the current most pressing questions in the ultra-high-energy cosmic ray (UHECR) detection. The AugerPrime upgrade consists of the addition, on top of each station, of a scintillator detector, to separate the muonic and electromagnetic component of the shower for better primary identification, and of a radio detector to measure the emission of air showers in 30-80 MHz range. An additional small diameter photomultiplier is installed in each station to increase the dynamic range for signal detection. New electronic modules, installed on all stations, provide a sufficient number of channels for the readout of the additional detectors, as well as faster sampling, increased dynamic range and processing capability. In this contribution we summarize the performance of the new electronic modules with respect to the requirements, describe the verification procedure and give the results in the laboratory tests compared to the performance in the field.

The Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), a next-generation ground-based gamma-ray observatory, will be composed of two arrays of multiple imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) located in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Its goal is to enhance the sensitivity of current instruments by a factor of five to ten over an energy range from 20 GeV to over 300 TeV. IACT arrays are used to probe the very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray sky, operating by simultaneously observing air showers triggered by the interaction of VHE gamma rays and cosmic rays with the atmosphere. Cherenkov photons produced by these showers create a stereoscopic record of the event. By reconstructing the event using machine learning techniques, the properties of the originating VHE particle-including its type, energy, and incoming direction-can be determined. In this contribution, we present a fully deep-learning-driven approach to reconstruct simulated, stereoscopic IACT events using CTLearn. CTLearn is a package designed for loading and manipulating IACT data and for running deep learning models with pixel-wise camera data as input.

We present a study of HerS-3, a dusty star-forming galaxy at zspec = 3.0607, which is gravitationally amplified into an Einstein cross with a fifth image of the background galaxy seen at the center of the cross. Detailed 1-mm spectroscopy and imaging with NOEMA and ALMA resolve the individual images and show that each of the five images display a series of molecular lines that have similar central velocities, unambiguously confirming that they have identical redshifts. The HST F110W image reveals a foreground lensing group of four galaxies with a photometric redshift zphot~1.0. Lens models that only include the four visible galaxies are unable to reproduce the properties of HerS-3. By adding a fifth massive component, lying south-east of the brightest galaxy of the group, the source reconstruction is able to match the peak emission, shape and orientation for each of the five images. The fact that no galaxy is detected near that position indicates the presence of a massive dark matter halo in the lensing galaxy group. In the source plane, HerS-3 appears as an infrared luminous starburst galaxy seen nearly edge-on. The serendipitous discovery of this exceptional Einstein cross offers a potential laboratory for exploring at small spatial scales a nuclear starburst at the peak of cosmic evolution and studying the properties of a massive dark matter halo associated with the lensing galaxy group.

No evidence for $H_0$ anisotropy from Tully-Fisher or supernova distances

Claims of anisotropy in the Hubble constant have been made based on direct distance tracers such as Tully-Fisher galaxies and Type Ia supernovae. We revisit these using the CosmicFlows-4 Tully-Fisher W1 subsample, 2MTF and SFI++ Tully-Fisher catalogues, and the Pantheon+ supernova compilation (restricted to $z < 0.05$), including a dipole in either the Tully-Fisher zero-point or the standardised supernova absolute magnitude. Our forward-modelling framework jointly calibrates the distance relation, marginalises over distances, and accounts for peculiar velocities using a linear-theory reconstruction. We compare the anisotropic and isotropic model using the Bayesian evidence. In the CosmicFlows-4 sample, we infer a zero-point dipole of amplitude $0.087 \pm 0.019$ mag, or $4.1\pm0.9$ per cent when expressed as a dipole in the Hubble parameter. This is consistent with previous estimates but at higher significance: model comparison yields odds of $877\!:\!1$ in favour of including the zero-point dipole. In Pantheon+ we infer zero-point dipole amplitude of $0.049 \pm 0.013$ mag, or $2.3\pm 0.6$ per cent when expressed as a dipole in the Hubble parameter. However, by allowing for a radially varying velocity dipole, we show that the anisotropic model captures local flow features (or possibly systematics) in the data rather than an actual linearly growing effective bulk flow caused by anisotropy in the zero-point or expansion rate. Inferring a more general bulk flow curve we find results fully consistent with expectations from the standard cosmological model.

Early stages of stellar birth comprise of a two-step process involving the formation of two hydrostatic cores. The second step of gravitational collapse sets the radiative efficiency and accretion rate of the young protostar. These two parameters, of prime importance for protostellar evolution, dictate the luminosities and thus play a key role in deciphering the current discrepancy between observational surveys and theoretical models. In this letter, we provide quantitative estimates on the evolution of the radiative efficiency and accretion rate obtained from self-consistent, high-resolution, radiative hydrodynamic simulations performed using the codes PLUTO and RAMSES. The main highlight of our result is that the radiative efficiency reaches unity, that is, supercriticality, relatively quickly after protostellar birth. Supercriticality at the accretion shock is a necessary condition for cold accretion. Our results thus support a rapid transition to the cold accretion scenario, which is one of the assumptions used in Pre-Main Sequence (PMS) models working towards solutions to explain observational data. We briefly discuss the implications of the time evolution of the radiative efficiency factor in the context of the luminosity problem, the Protostellar Luminosity Function (PLF), PMS evolution, accurate sink properties, and the stellar Initial Mass Function (IMF).

Imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) detect extended air showers (EASs) generated when very-high-energy (VHE) gamma rays or cosmic rays interact with the Earth's atmosphere. Cherenkov photons produced during an EAS are captured by fast-imaging cameras, which record both the spatial and temporal development of the shower, along with calorimetric data. By analyzing these recordings, the properties of the original VHE particle-such as its type, energy, and direction of arrival-can be reconstructed through machine learning techniques. This contribution focuses on the Large-Sized Telescopes (LSTs) of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory, a next-generation ground-based gamma-ray observatory. LSTs are responsible for reconstructing lower-energy gamma rays in the tens of GeV range. We explore a novel event reconstruction technique based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) applied on calibrated and cleaned waveforms of the IACT camera pixels using CTLearn. Our approach explicitly incorporates the time development of the shower, enabling a more accurate reconstruction of the event. This method eliminates the need for charge integration or handcrafted feature extraction, allowing the model to directly learn from waveform data.

Double-source-plane strong gravitational lenses (DSPLs), with two sources at different redshifts, are independent cosmological probes of the dark energy equation of state parameter $w$ and the matter density parameter $\Omega_{\rm m}$. We present the lens model for the DSPL AGEL035346$-$170639 and infer cosmological constraints from this system for flat $\Lambda$CDM and flat $w$CDM cosmologies. From the joint posterior of $w$ and $\Omega_{\rm m}$ in the flat $w$CDM cosmology, we extract the following median values and 1$\sigma$ uncertainties: $w = -1.52^{+0.49}_{-0.33}$ and $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.192^{+0.305}_{-0.131}$ from AGEL0353 alone. Combining our measurements with two previously analyzed DSPLs, we present the joint constraint on these parameters from a sample of three, the largest galaxy-scale DSPL sample used for cosmological measurement to date. The combined precision of $w$ from three DSPLs is higher by 15% over AGEL0353 alone. Combining DSPL and cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements improves the precision of $w$ from CMB-only constraints by 39%, demonstrating the complementarity of DSPLs with the CMB. Despite their promising constraining power, DSPLs are limited by sample size, with only a handful discovered so far. Although ongoing and near-future wide-area sky surveys will increase the number of known DSPLs by up to two orders of magnitude, these systems will still require dedicated high-resolution imaging and spectroscopic follow-ups like those presented in this paper. Our ASTRO 3D Galaxy Evolution with Lenses (AGEL) collaboration is undertaking such follow-up campaigns for several newly discovered DSPLs and will provide cosmological measurements from larger samples of DSPLs in the future.

Coasting cosmology offers an intriguing and straightforward framework for understanding the universe. In this work, we employ the Trans-Planckian Censorship Criterion (TCC) conjecture to test the viability of the coasting cosmology and propose an entropic dark energy (EDE) model within this framework. By applying the holographic principle to constrain the dark energy density and adopting the Bekenstein entropy and Tsallis entropy as the constraining entropies of the system, we find that, in a holographic coasting cosmological framework where dark energy and dark matter evolve independently, the Tsallis entropy satisfies certain general assumptions better than the Bekenstein entropy. Thus, there may be a fundamental relationship between Tsallis entropy and dark energy. We utilize observational data from Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), and Cosmic Chronometers (CC) to constrain EDE model. The optimal Tsallis parameter obtained aligns well with theoretical expectations. To evaluate the model's fit to the observed data, we calculate the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and Kullback Information Criterion (KIC), and compare these metrics with those derived from $\Lambda$CDM, under which the model shows some improvement. Overall, this model provides a novel and simple on the evolution of the universe.

A hybrid machine learning model which combines a shallow convolutional neural network and a long short-term memory network (CNN--LSTM), has been developed to automate the detection of kink oscillations in coronal plasma loops within large volumes of high-cadence sequences of imaging data. The network was trained on a set of 10,000 synthetic data cubes designed to mimic sequences of coronal images, achieving an accuracy greater than 98\% on this synthetic dataset. The model was then applied to detect kink oscillations in real data cubes of coronal active regions observed with SDO/AIA in the 171~Å channel. This dataset consisted of 50 samples with visually detected kink oscillations and 128 samples without. Each sample covered an area of 260$\times$260~pixels in the spatial domain and a duration of 30~min with a 12~s cadence in the time domain. Both off-limb and on-disk regions of interest were used. The data were pre-processed by median filtering in the time domain, and Gaussian smoothing and Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization in the spatial domain. In the real dataset, the performance of the model was 83.7\%.The model is fully available in open access. We regard the CNN--LSTM model developed as a first step toward creating robust tools for routine solar coronal data mining in the context of coronal oscillation study.

V659 Cen is a classical Cepheid which is part of a multiple system. Previous observations have shown that a hot companion dominates an ultraviolet spectrum and a cooler main sequence star dominates an XMM-Newton spectrum. The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) spectra discussed here spatially resolve the components and show that the secondary in the spectroscopic binary with the Cepheid is the low mass star, and the hottest star in the system is the outer companion. In addition a fourth star is a likely member of the system based on Gaia data. A new orbit is derived which includes new radial velocities.

We present updated constraints on an interacting dark energy - dark matter model with pure momentum transfer, where dark energy is in the form of a quintessence scalar field with an exponential potential. We run a suite of MCMC analyses using the DESI DR2 BAO measurements, in combination with CMB data from Planck and supernovae data from DESY5. In contrast to the standard case of uncoupled quintessence, we find that values for the potential's slope parameter $\lambda \geq \sqrt{2}$, which are conjectured by string theory scenarios, are not excluded. If $\lambda$ is fixed to such a value, we find that the data favour the negative coupling branch of the model, which is the branch exhibiting late-time growth suppression. We also derive 95% upper limits on the sum of the neutrino masses, finding $\sum m_\nu < 0.06$ eV ($\sum m_\nu < 0.16$ eV) when $\lambda$ is fixed (varied). Our results motivate further studies on dynamical dark energy models that obey string theory bounds and can be constrained with cosmological observations.

The NectarCAM flat-field flasher is a calibration device designed for the camera that will equip the Medium-Sized Telescopes (MSTs) of the northern site of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO). Positioned in the centre of the MST dish, 16 meters in front of the camera, the flasher emits short (FWHM $\approx$ 5 ns), uniform (2$-$4%) light pulses to illuminate the entire focal plane.
Accurate calibration is crucial for the optimal operation of the NectarCAM, ensuring precise gain computation and mitigating differences in light-collection efficiency of the pixels of the camera. Using the flat-field flasher, two informations are obtained : the pixel gain and the relative efficiency between pixels. In addition, the flasher is used to probe the dynamic range over which the camera operates effectively.
In this study, we report on the performance characterisation of the flat-field flasher using a dedicated test bench. We report on the results of tests conducted on several flasher units, evaluating their reliability. Furthermore, we describe how the flat-field coefficients are applied within the camera to ensure uniformity of response of few percent level across all 1855 pixels.
As the deployment of the first MST at the CTAO northern site is scheduled for 2027, this work represents a significant contribution to the collaboration`s efforts to finalize camera calibration systems.

Reliable estimation of stellar surface gravity (log $g$) for a large sample is crucial for evaluating stellar evolution models and understanding galactic structure; However, it is not easy to accomplish due to the difficulty in gathering a large spectroscopic data set. Photometric sky survey using a specific filter, on the other hand, can play a substantial role in the assessment of log $g$. The Stellar Abundances and Galactic Evolution Survey (SAGES) utilizes eight filters to provide accurate stellar parameters for $\sim10^{7}$ stars, with its DDO51 intermediate-band filter specifically designed for robust log $g$ determination. In this work, the observed SAGES $u_{\rm SC}$ and $v_{\rm SAGES}$ photometry, the synthetic photometry in $g$, $r$, $i$, and DDO51 bands derived from \textit{Gaia} XP spectra are employed to investigate the importance of the DDO51 filter in the determination of log $g$. We applied machine-learning-based extinction correction and employed XGBoost models, trained on stellar parameters from LAMOST, to predict log $g$ using photometric data. By comparing model predicted log $g$ with LAMOST values, we find that including DDO51 filter improve the accuracies of log $g$ estimates by 21.0\% (from 0.224\,dex to 0.177\,dex) overall, and by 26.5\% (from 0.302\,dex to 0.222\,dex ) for GK-type stars, as compared to those obtained without DDO51. The DDO51 filter is also validated to be particularly effective for metal-poor stars ([Fe/H]$<$-1.0), where it significantly mitigates systematic biases. Our findings highlight the diagnostic power of the SAGES DDO51 filter, providing enhanced stellar characterization vital for future in-depth studies of the Milky Way.

The Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) is uniquely able to perform deep, 15" resolutions imaging at frequencies below 100 MHz. Observations in this regime, using the Low Band Antenna (LBA) system, are significantly affected by instrumental and ionospheric distortions. Recent developments in calibration techniques have enabled routine production of high-fidelity images at these challenging frequencies. The aim of this paper is to obtain images of the radio sources included in the Third Cambridge catalog, second revised version (3CRR), at an observing frequency of 58 MHz, with an angular resolution of 15"and sensitivity to both compact and diffuse radio emission. This work also aims to produce accurate flux measurements for all sources. This dataset is designed to serve as a reference for low-frequency radio galaxy studies and future spectral aging analyses. We deliver 58. MHz radio images for the complete 3CRR sample including flux density measurements. We determined that the LBA has an accurate flux density scale with an average flux uncertainty of 10%. This is an important confirmation for any future works using the LOFAR LBA system. With these results we characterize the bright radio galaxy population with new high-resolution low-frequency images. We also provide high-resolution models of these sources which will be useful for calibrating future surveys. This legacy survey significantly expands the available high-resolution data at low frequencies and is the first fully imaged high-resolution sample at ultra low frequencies (< 100 MHz). It lays the foundation for future studies of radio galaxy physics, low-energy cosmic-ray populations, and the interplay between radio jets and their environments.

Complex organic molecules (COMs) are thought to be the precursors of pre-biotic molecules and are observed in many protostellar sources. For this paper we studied the formation of COMs during star formation and their evolution in the midplane of the circumstellar disk up to the end of the Class I stage. We used the Analytical Protostellar Environment (APE) code to perform analytical simulations of star formation and the Nautilus code to model the chemical evolution. Most COMs mainly form during the collapse or in the disk, except the lightest (CH3CCH, C3H6, CH3OH, CH3CHO, CH3OCH3, C2H5OH, CH3CN, CH3NC, C2H3CN, and CH3SH), which are significantly inherited by the disk from the prestellar phase. Over the first 150 kyr of the disk, the abundances of several COMs in the midplane vary negligibly (e.g., CH3CCH, CH3OH, and CH3CN), while others experience a variation of one order of magnitude (e.g., C2H3CHO HOCH2CHO, and CH3COCH2OH). Changing physical conditions also have an impact on the abundance profiles of COMs in the disk, and their inheritance. For example, increasing the temperature of the molecular cloud from 10 K to 15 K significantly promotes the formation of COMs in the prestellar phase, notably c-C2H4O and N-bearing species. Conversely, increasing the cloud mass from 2 Msol to 5 Msol only has a minor effect on the disk abundances in the early stages.

The Polarimeter to Unify the Corona and Heliosphere (PUNCH) mission is a NASA Small Explorer to determine the cross-scale processes that unify the solar corona and heliosphere. PUNCH has two science objectives: (1) understand how coronal structures become the ambient solar wind, and (2) understand the dynamic evolution of transient structures, such as coronal mass ejections, in the young solar wind. To address these objectives, PUNCH uses a constellation of four small spacecraft in Sun-synchronous low Earth orbit, to collect linearly polarized images of the K corona and young solar wind. The four spacecraft each carry one visible-light imager in a 1+3 configuration: a single Narrow Field Imager solar coronagraph captures images of the outer corona at all position angles, and at solar elongations from 1.5° (6 R$_\odot$) to 8° (32 R$_\odot$); and three separate Wide Field Imager heliospheric imagers together capture views of the entire inner solar system, at solar elongations from 3° (12 R$_\odot$) to 45° (180 R$_\odot$) from the Sun. PUNCH images include linear-polarization data, to enable inferring the three-dimensional structure of visible features without stereoscopy. The instruments are matched in wavelength passband, support overlapping instantaneous fields of view, and are operated synchronously, to act as a single ``virtual instrument'' with a 90° wide field of view, centered on the Sun. PUNCH launched in March of 2025 and began science operations in June of 2025. PUNCH has an open data policy with no proprietary period, and PUNCH Science Team Meetings are open to all.

The publications of Gaia DR2 and DR3 have brought major improvements in stellar astrometry and photometry, particularly regarding the description of the white dwarf sequence. Notably, Gaia DR2 enabled the detection of variability in white dwarfs based solely on averaged astrometric and photometric quantities, i.e. the astrometric 5 parameters (positions, proper motion, and parallax) and general photometry properties in the G, BP and RP bands (mean, standard deviation and number of measurements). We identify and classify variable white dwarfs using Gaia DR3 data and Zwicky Transient Facility DR23 observations. The objective is to construct a catalogue of pulsating white dwarf candidates with robust selection criteria. We define a new sample of candidate variable white dwarfs using Gaia DR3 astrometric and photometric data. We cross-match this sample with the ZTF DR23 catalogue and apply a multiband Lomb-Scargle periodogram analysis to detect periodic variability. We then use the OPTICS unsupervised clustering algorithm to to group and classify the confirmed periodic stars. We identify 1423 variable white dwarfs candidates from Gaia DR3, with 864 having ZTF time series. 141 present significant periodicity. We classify these objects into known categories, including ZZ Ceti stars, GW Vir, V777 Her, and white dwarf-main sequence binaries. Our analysis yields several periodic stars, including three ZZ Ceti, 15 GW Vir, one V777 Her, and 24 WD-MS binaries. Furthermore, it reveals a significant population of potentialy variable stars, though without confirmed periodicity. Finally we publish our catalogue of candidate variable white dwarfs including variability status, periodicity, and classification information for the 864 sources with ZTF time series, 519 of them newly identified (including 83 new periodic stars).

Parameterizing quasi-quintessence and quasi-phantom fields without the nearly flat potential approximation

An alternative dark energy description based on a generalized K-essence scenario is here explored. In particular, we consider a \emph{quasi-quintessence} and/or \emph{quasi-phantom} field, whose pressure does not depend on the kinetic energy, firstly discussed in the context of the cosmological constant problem. In so doing, we fix the background evolution and investigate the main observational signatures of its corresponding fluid-like representation. The corresponding scalar field can be parameterized independently from the potential form and without imposing the condition $\omega \sim -1$ used for quintessence and phantom fields. Additionally, we constrain the model parameters by performing Monte-Carlo Markov chain simulations through the adoption of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and perform separated analyses, employing different data catalogs. More precisely, as data sets we employ observational Hubble data, type Ia supernovae and the second data release from the DESI Collaboration, namely DESI DR2. We define a hierarchy among analyses and, precisely, in the first we adopt all three samples, while the second excludes the DESI data points, with the aim of facing its effect on corresponding bounds. Our findings suggest that the \emph{quasi-quintessence} scenario prefers Planck's value of the Hubble constant $H_0$, but suggesting that, when the DESI sample is excluded from our computations, $\omega_0$ enters the phantom regime, although still compatible at $1$-$\sigma$ confidence level with a cosmological constant. Remarkably, these results appear in tension than those found for a standard quintessence, explored within the context of the recent DESI release, likely indicating that the DESI data may furnish inconclusive results depending on the kind of scalar field involved into the computation.

High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE)
In recent years, the number of known sources emitting very- and ultra-high-energy gamma-rays has increased significantly thanks to facilities such as LHAASO and HAWC. Many of the observed sources are still unidentified or poorly constrained due to the limited angular resolution of these instruments; however, it is now ascertained that approximately half of them have a pulsar in coincidence. Some of these unidentified extended sources may be the result of the diffusion of leptons accelerated by the pulsar itself or in its nebula to energies exceeding 50 TeV. This new class of sources, called TeV halos, is characterized by a peculiar radial profile that, if properly resolved, is key to distinguishing them from other TeV sources that are associated with a pulsar, such as supernova remnants and pulsar wind nebulae. In this contribution, we consider all the pulsars which are spatially coincident with an unidentified extended TeV source, in order to quantify whether its spin-down power, age and distance allow the pulsar to produce a TeV halo with the observed flux and extension. We also investigate how the next generation of Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs), namely the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) and the ASTRI Mini-Array, will observe and characterize these TeV halos. We present a set of simulated sources with the expected morphology and spectrum, and we show for which of them we can distinguish between TeV halos and other classes of extended sources.

To CLEAN or not to CLEAN: Data Processing in the ngVLA era

Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM)
Radio interferometric imaging has long relied on the CLEAN algorithm, valued for its speed, robustness, and integration with calibration pipelines. However, next-generation facilities such as the ngVLA, SKA, and ALMAs Wideband Sensitivity Upgrade will produce data volumes and dynamic ranges that exceed the scalability of traditional methods. CLEAN remains dominant due to its simplicity and accumulated expertise, yet its assumption of modeling the sky as point sources limits its ability to recover extended emission and hampers automation. We review CLEANs limitations and survey alternatives, including multiscale extensions, compressive sensing, Regularized Maximum Likelihood, Bayesian inference, and AI-driven approaches. Forward-modeling methods enable higher fidelity, flexible priors, and uncertainty quantification, albeit at greater computational cost. Hybrid approaches such as Autocorr-CLEAN, CG-CLEAN, and PolyCLEAN retain CLEANs workflow while incorporating modern optimization. We argue hybrids are best suited for the near term, while Bayesian and AI-based frameworks represent the long-term future of interferometric imaging.

Influence of the Spectral Energy Distribution of Reionization-Era Sources on the Lyman-$α$ Forest

Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)
Interpreting Lyman-$\alpha$ forest properties during the epoch of reionization requires assumptions about the spectral energy distribution (SED) of ionizing sources. These are often simplified to blackbody or power-law spectra, potentially overlooking contributions from high-energy processes. In this work, we investigate how different SED models of reionization-era sources shape the thermal and ionization state of the intergalactic medium (IGM) and imprint on the Ly$\alpha$ forest during the late stages of reionization. We perform $3D$ radiative transfer simulations with CRASH, post-processed on Sherwood-type hydrodynamical outputs, exploring both physically motivated SEDs including X-ray binaries, Bremsstrahlung from shock-heated interstellar medium, and binary stars and idealized blackbody and power-law spectra. While the large-scale morphology of ionized regions is broadly similar across all models, harder spectral components extend partially ionized zones, produce larger He III regions, and heat the surrounding IGM. By adopting simplified spectra there is the risk of underestimating the contribution of high-energy sources, which subtly alter the effective optical depth, the flux power, and the local transmissivity, potentially biasing constraints on the thermal and ionization history of the IGM. The differences across models are most pronounced in the behavior of the proximity zone and in the power at intermediate scales, offering the most promising diagnostics to disentangle source populations. With upcoming high precision measurements from ELT and DESI, realistic SED modelling will be essential for robustly connecting Ly$\alpha$ forest observations to the sources driving the end of reionization.

Measuring the Two-Dimensional Thermal Structures of Protoplanetary Disks

Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
We present a flexible, annulus-by-annulus method to constrain the 2-D thermal structure of a protoplanetary disk from optically thick spectral line emission. Using synthetic disk models with a known temperature and density structure, we extracted the vertical emission surfaces and brightness temperatures in radial annuli for multiple CO isotopologue transitions and used them to infer the vertical temperature profiles. This approach reliably recovers the injected temperature structure despite noise and finite resolution. We demonstrated that even a modest set of emission lines can constrain the temperature across a wide range of radii and elevations. Nevertheless, biases in the extracted emission surfaces constitute a major source of systematic error. Finally, we applied this method to archival ALMA observations of the HD 163296 disk, revealing that simple parametric radial temperature models may obscure the complexity of real disks and that additional observations are necessary to distinguish between different models of the vertical structure. This flexible framework can be readily applied to other systems, helping to characterize the thermal environments that shape planet formation.

A carbon-rich disk surrounding a planetary-mass companion

Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
During the final assembly of gas giant planets, circumplanetary disks (CPDs) of gas and dust form due to the conservation of angular momentum, providing material to be accreted onto the planet and the ingredients for moons. The composition of these disks has remained elusive, as their faint nature and short separations from their host stars have limited our ability to access them. Now, with the spatial and spectral resolution of JWST/MIRI Medium-Resolution Spectrograph, we can observe and characterize this reservoir for wide-orbit planetary-mass companions for the first time. We present the mid-infrared spectrum from the CPD surrounding the young companion CT Cha b. The data show a carbon-rich chemistry with seven carbon-bearing molecules (up to C$_6$H$_6$) and one isotopologue detected and indicate a high gaseous C/O$>$1 that is in contrast with the elemental abundance ratios typically measured in directly imaged gas giant atmospheres. This carbon-rich chemistry is also in stark contrast to the spectrum of the disk surrounding the host star, CT Cha A, which shows no carbon-bearing molecules. This difference in disk chemistry between the host disk and its companion indicates rapid, divergent chemical evolution on $\sim$million-year timescales. Nonetheless, the chemical properties of the CPD follow trends observed in isolated objects, where disks transition from an oxygen-rich to carbon-rich composition with decreasing host mass. Our results provide the first direct insight into the chemical and physical properties of material being accreted onto a gas giant analogue and into its potential moon system.

Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO)
The peculiar velocities of dark matter tracers drive the growth of cosmic structures, providing a sensitive test of cosmological models and strengthening constraints on the nature of dark energy. In this work, we investigate the mean pairwise velocities, $v_{12}$, of dark matter tracers as a cosmological probe in the non-linear regime of cosmic structure formation. Using N-body dark matter-only simulations, we measure $v_{12}$ for pair separations up to 50 $h^{-1}$Mpc and model it by solving the pair conservation equation for a self-gravitating particle system, along with various prescriptions of the nonlinear matter power spectrum. We quantified the sensitivity of $v_{12}$ to variations in key cosmological parameters such as $\Omega_{\mathrm{m}}$, $\sigma_8$, $h$, $M_\nu$, and $w$. Our parameter inference analysis using MCMC shows sub-11% agreement with simulation data, with notable degeneracies, particularly between $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ and $\sigma_8$. We further compute the stable clustering crossing scale across redshifts $z=0$, $0.5$, and $1$, assessing its dependence on cosmology. Among the tested power spectrum modeling approaches, we find that the CSSTEmu emulator provides the most accurate predictions, with deviations below 5% for $r > 10$ $h^{-1}$Mpc at $z=0.5$. Our results are validated using independent simulation suites, demonstrating that our framework offers a robust method for extracting cosmological constraints from upcoming peculiar velocity data.

Gravitational collapse with torsion and universe in a black hole
Nikodem Popławski

Subjects:
General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO)
We consider gravitational collapse of a fluid sphere with torsion generated by spin, which forms a black hole. We use the Tolman metric and the Einstein$-$Cartan field equations with a relativistic spin fluid as a source. We show that gravitational repulsion of torsion prevents a singularity, replacing it with a nonsingular bounce. Quantum particle creation during contraction prevents shear from overcoming torsion. Particle creation during expansion can generate a finite period of inflation and produce large amounts of matter. The resulting closed universe on the other side of the event horizon may have several bounces. Such a universe is oscillatory, with each cycle larger than the preceding cycle, until it reaches a size at which dark energy dominates and expands indefinitely. Our Universe might have therefore originated from a black hole existing in another universe.

We present a simplified review of inflationary cosmology across various modified gravity theories. These include models based on curvature, torsion, and non-metricity. We explore how scalar fields interact with different geometric quantities and how these interactions affect inflationary dynamics. Key cosmological features such as background evolution, reheating, and observable parameters are discussed. We also examine exotic scenarios inspired by string theory, extra dimensions, and non-local models. This work aims to connect theoretical models with observational data and future missions, offering guidance for exploring inflation beyond general relativity.

We propose the Semiconductor-Quantum-Well Axion Radiometer Experiment ($\texttt{SQWARE}$) -- a new experimental platform for direct detection of axion dark matter in the meV mass range -- based on resonantly enhanced axion-photon conversion through the inverse Primakoff effect in engineered quantum semiconductor heterostructures. The core of the radiometer is a GaAs/AlGaAs multiple quantum well structure forming a magnetoplasmonic cavity, containing an ultrahigh-mobility two-dimensional electron gas, which realizes a tunable epsilon-near-zero resonance in the terahertz frequency range. By controlling the orientation of the cavity within a strong external magnetic field, both the resonance frequency and the axion-induced current are optimized $\textit{in situ}$, enabling efficient scanning across a broad mass range without complex mechanical adjustment. The axion-induced electromagnetic signal radiatively emitted from the magnetoplasmonic cavity is detected by a state-of-the-art photodetector. We present the theoretical basis for resonant enhancement, detail the experimental design and benchmarks through extensive simulations, and project the sensitivity of $\texttt{SQWARE}$ for several realistic configurations. Our results demonstrate that $\texttt{SQWARE}$ can probe the well-motivated quantum chromodynamics axion parameter space and close a critical gap in direct searches at meV masses.

Gravitational effects are known to violate global symmetries, threatening the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) solution to the strong CP problem. Ultraviolet completions featuring a gauged $U(1)$ symmetry, where $U(1)_{\rm PQ}$ arises as an accidental global symmetry, can suppress Planck-suppressed operators, enabling high-quality axions in a mass window where it can also account for the observed dark matter (DM) in the Universe. We show that in such models, the spontaneous breaking of the $U(1)$ gauge symmetry generates a strong stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) from gauge cosmic string loops. For breaking scales $\gtrsim 10^{14}$ GeV, the SGWB signal strength exceeds astrophysical foregrounds across a broad frequency range. Contrary to conventional gauge cosmic string scenarios, such quality axion models have a characteristic IR break frequency originating from the collapse of string-wall network around axion oscillation temperature. We propose this characteristic SGWB frequency-amplitude region, identified as \textit{Signature-Window-Axion-Gravitational waves} (SWAG), to be a novel probe of high-quality axion DM at future space and ground-based interferometers.

We investigate a particle dark matter (DM) scenario where the DM interaction with the Standard Model are mediated by a leptophilic effective operator. Unlike conventional WIMP scenarios where thermal freeze-out occurs in a radiation-dominated Universe, we consider DM freeze-out during a prolonged reheating epoch driven by inflaton decay. The resulting departure from standard cosmology alters the thermal evolution of the dark matter abundance, making it sensitive to the reheating temperature and the history of entropy injection. The leptophilic nature of the interaction, motivated by the absence of DM signals in the current LHC searches, suppresses couplings to quarks and gluons and instead enables viable DM-lepton interactions that remain largely unconstrained. Within this setup, we analyze the mono-Higgs plus missing energy channel at future lepton colliders where the same operator responsible for setting the relic abundance can be directly probed. We perform a detailed signal-background analysis using both polarized and unpolarized beams. Additionally, our results illustrate how collider experiments, when interpreted jointly with relic density constraints, can provide indirect hints of the Universe's thermal history, offering potential insights into the reheating temperature and the dynamics preceding Big Bang Nucleosynthesis.

Initial Orbit Determination (IOD) is the classical problem of estimating the orbit of a body in space without any presumed information about the orbit. The geometric formulation of the ''angles-only'' IOD in three-dimensional space: find a conic curve with a given focal point meeting the given lines of sight (LOS). We provide an algebraic reformulation of this problem and confirm that five is the minimal number of lines necessary to have a finite number of solutions in a non-special case, and the number of complex solutions is 66. We construct a subdivision method to search for the normal direction to the orbital plane as a point on the real projective plane. The resulting algorithm is fast as it discovers only a handful of the solutions that are real and physically meaningful.

Electron Inertia and Magnetic Reconnection

The finite electron mass can cause magnetic reconnection even in the absence of any other non-ideal effect in a magnetic evolution. It will be shown that when electron inertia is the only non-ideal effect in the evolution of the magnetic field $\vec{B}$, there is a related field that evolves ideally. This field is $\vec{\mathcal{B}} \equiv \vec{B} + \vec{\nabla}\times \left( (m_e/n e^2) \vec{j} \right)$ with $m_e$ the electron mass, $n$ the electron number density, and $\vec{j}$ the current density. Although the magnetic field is modified from its ideal evolution form by the electron inertia, the effect on particle trajectories, even electron trajectories, is small unless the current lies in thin sheets, which make $\vec{j}$ extremely large. The field $\vec{\mathcal{B}}$ is closely related to Voigt normalized magnetic field, which is defined by a Laplacian smoothing of $\vec{B}$. The difference between $\vec{\mathcal{B}}$ and $\vec{B}$ involves the relativistically invariant four-space Laplacian acting on $\vec{B}$ with a $c/\omega_{pe}$ smoothing distance; $\omega_{pe}$ is the plasma frequency.

The plethora of space-borne and ground-based observatories has provided astrophysicists with an unprecedented volume of data, which can only be processed at scale using advanced computing algorithms. Consequently, ensuring the quality of data fed into machine learning (ML) models is critical. The H$\alpha$ observations from the GONG network represent one such data stream, producing several observations per minute, 24/7, since 2010. In this study, we introduce a lightweight (non-ML) anomaly-detection algorithm, called H-Alpha Anomalyzer, designed to identify anomalous observations based on user-defined criteria. Unlike many black-box algorithms, our approach highlights exactly which regions triggered the anomaly flag and quantifies the corresponding anomaly likelihood. For our comparative analysis, we also created and released a dataset of 2,000 observations, equally divided between anomalous and non-anomalous cases. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model not only outperforms existing methods but also provides explainability, enabling qualitative evaluation by domain experts.

Systematic Bayesian Evaluation of Resonance Parameters in 19Ne for the 15O(alpha,gamma)19Ne and 18F(p,alpha)15O Reactions

We present a comprehensive evaluation of the nuclear structure properties of 19Ne using a novel and rigorous Bayesian statistical framework. Precise characterization of 19Ne resonance parameters is critical for accurately determining reaction rates of the astrophysically significant 15O(alpha, gamma)19Ne and 18F(p, alpha)15O reactions, which govern breakout from the hot CNO cycle in X-ray bursts and influence gamma-ray emission in novae, respectively. By reconstructing likelihood functions from published experimental data, including asymmetric uncertainties and upper or lower limits, we derive posterior distributions for resonance energies, decay widths, and branching ratios. Our Bayesian approach systematically incorporates previously reported discrepancies among measurements, providing a statistically robust and consistent treatment of these uncertainties. The evaluated resonance parameters and associated uncertainties provide crucial input for stellar nucleosynthesis modeling, contributing to a refined understanding of explosive astrophysical phenomena.

We derive generalized geodesic equations in curved spacetime that include conservative forces, dissipative effects, and quantum-gravity-motivated minimal-length corrections. Conservative interactions are incorporated through external vector potentials, while dissipative dynamics arise from an exponential rescaling of the particle Lagrangian. Quantum-gravity effects are introduced via Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) deformed Poisson brackets in the Hamiltonian framework. We show that free-particle geodesics remain unaffected at leading order, but external potentials induce velocity-dependent corrections, implying possible violations of the equivalence principle. As an application, we analyze modified trajectories in Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universes dominated by dust, radiation, stiff matter, and dark energy. Our results establish a unified approach to conservative, dissipative, and GUP-corrected geodesics, providing a framework to probe the interplay between external forces, spacetime curvature, and Planck-scale physics.

We investigate cosmology-driven modifications to Schwarzschild-like black hole spacetimes and analyze their impact on photon propagation, gravitational lensing, and shadow observation. The gravitational deflection angle is computed using the Rindler-Ishak method, which incorporates finite-distance corrections and provides a consistent framework for non-asym-ptotically flat spacetimes. The effective potential for null geodesics exhibits a single unstable maximum corresponding to the photon sphere, and we study photon orbits classified according to the critical impact parameter into capture, escape, and unstable circular trajectories. Our analysis shows that the deflection angle decreases with increasing model parameter $(\alpha)$, resulting in weaker light bending compared to the Schwarzschild case. In addition, we examine the angular diameter of the black hole shadow as measured by a static observer, highlighting its dependence on the cosmological modification parameters. These results suggest that high-precision astrometric and lensing observations can place meaningful constraints on cosmology-inspired modifications to gravity, thereby linking astrophysical black holes with cosmic expansion and offering a novel probe of gravitational physics in strong-field regimes.

We develop a theoretical framework for axion dark matter (DM) searches using terrestrial electromagnetic (EM) fields. Axions couple to the geomagnetic field and generate a monochromatic EM signal at a frequency set by the axion mass. Incorporating a realistic atmospheric conductivity, we describe the axion-induced EM waves confined in the Earth-ionosphere cavity, avoiding the divergences present in idealized treatments. Our semi-analytical method yields quantitative predictions for the axion-induced magnetic field near the Earth's surface, and we found that (i) at $m_{\rm a} \gtrsim 10^{-14}$ eV, the signal exhibits resonance structures aligned with Schumann resonances, and the magnetic field amplitude is especially enhanced at $m_{\rm a} \sim 3 \times 10^{-14}$ eV. (ii) The signal amplitude and orientation also vary with geographic location, with Southeast Asia offering the strongest sensitivity. These predictions are insensitive to uncertainties in conductivity models and boundary conditions. Those distinctive features provide a reliable template to distinguish axion-induced signals from natural or anthropogenic EM backgrounds, and the formalism can be extended to other DM candidates such as dark photons.

Title:
Enhancement of Weak Interactions in Phase Transitions

Weak interactions cause small parity-violating energy differences between left- and right-handed chiral systems. Although normally tiny, these effects may be significantly enhanced during collective phenomena such as phase transitions. We propose a theoretical model describing the enhancement of weak interactions in phase transitions. The enhancement factor is proportional to the critical number of atoms, $N_c$, in the nucleus of the new phase. After the nucleus reaches its critical size, it grows until it fills the entire system. Measurement of the ratio of produced left and right chiral structures may provide a way to measure this critical number $N_c$. Experiments where definite spin-chiral structures are formed during a phase transition in crossed electric and magnetic fields, indicate $N_c \sim 10^9 - 10^{10}$. An open question is whether a similar enhancement could operate during cosmological phase transitions - thereby boosting CP-violating effects sufficiently to contribute to the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry (baryogenesis).

Purpose: We have investigated the cross section around the lowest direct coincident gamma-particle measurements, where previously only limits could be established with the aim of obtaining a detailed description of the excitation function. We have furthermore analysed the ratio of extreme decay branching into the first excited state of daughter nuclei with alpha or proton emission at relative kinetic energies where previous measurements are in disagreement with each other. Conclusions: Our findings in the astrophysics RoI support reaction-rate models with a lower average S-factor trend, that deviates significantly from standard extrapolations between 2.2 MeV and 2.6 MeV, for stellar carbon burning simulations of up to 25 Msol stars. Based on our data, an overall increase of the S-factor at deep subbarrier energy cannot be confirmed. The extremely low ratio of the branching into the first excited state with proton over alpha emission of ~ 2% at 3.23 MeV might indicate the presence of alpha cluster compound states in 24Mg. This highly favours {\alpha} emission with fundamental consequences in possible stellar carbon burning sites.

We construct the Lagrangian formulation of a micro-structured spinning, dilating and shearing (deformable) test body, moving in arbitrary non-Riemannian backgrounds possessing all geometrical entities of curvature, torsion and non-metricity. We start with a Lagrangian of a generic form that depends on the particle's velocity, its material frame and its absolute derivative, and the background geometry consisting of a metric and an independent affine connection. Performing variations of the path and the material frame, we derive the equations of motion for the particle that govern the evolution of its momentum and hypermomentum in this generic background. The reported equations of motion generalize those of a spinning particle (Mathisson \cite{Mathisson:1937zz}, Papapetrou \cite{Papapetrou:1951pa}, Dixon \cite{Dixon:1974xoz}) by the inclusion of the dilation and shear (hadronic) currents of matter. Using the derived equations of motion, a generalized conserved quantity is also found. Further conserved quantities that can be obtained by appropriate supplementary conditions are also discussed.

A Comprehensive Framework for F-statistic-based Parameter Estimation of Binary Black Hole Signals

Subjects:

We present a comprehensive investigation of the F-statistic method for parameter estimation of gravitational wave (GW) signals from binary black hole mergers. By analytically maximizing the likelihood over the luminosity distance and polarization angle, this approach reduces the dimensionality of the parameter space to enhance computational efficiency. We also introduce a novel formulation for calculating the Bayes factor for the F-statistic, enabling a quantitative assessment of its performance against standard full frequency-domain (FFD) Bayesian inference. Using the benchmark event GW150914, we demonstrate that the F-statistic method is not only approximately $70\%$ faster than FFD but is also statistically stable across different sampler configurations, with a log-Bayes factor between runs smaller than $0.1$. Furthermore, the F-statistic exhibits superior stability against changes in sampler configuration, yielding consistently lower Jensen-Shannon divergence values between analysis runs. While the F-statistic produces slightly broader constraints on some parameters, we argue this represents a more honest uncertainty quantification, particularly in high-dimensional parameter spaces with complex posterior structures. These results highlight the significant advantages of the F-statistic method for GW data analysis, positioning it as a powerful tool for the era of high-rate detections with future observatories.

Fine-grained dark matter substructure and axion haloscopes

The velocity distribution of cold dark matter within galaxies is expected to exhibit ultra-fine-grained substructure as a result of the many foldings of an initially smooth phase-space sheet under gravity. The innumerable folds of this sheet in the inner regions of a galactic halo would appear on solar-system scales like an extremely large number of spatially overlapping streams of dark matter particles. Some of these streams may also receive amplified densities if dark matter undergoes enhanced clustering in the early Universe, as is the case for axions in the post-inflationary scenario. This ultra-fine-grained dark matter substructure is usually considered irrelevant and undetectable for most direct detection experiments, but for axion haloscopes, this may not be the case. We develop and explore several plausible models for the degree of fine-grained axion dark matter substructure so as to evaluate its impact on the detectability of axions. We find that not only is this substructure detectable in haloscope experiments, but that it may enhance the detectability of the axion if data is analysed with a high-enough frequency resolution. This conclusion motivates ongoing high-resolution analyses of axion data by haloscope collaborations, which have the potential to reveal evidence of the QCD axion even if their nominal experimental sensitivity does not reach the required level under the Standard Halo Model assumption.

Importance of Shot Noise in the Search for an Isotropic Stochastic Gravitational-Wave Background with Next Generation Detectors

We investigate the impact of shot noise on the stochastic gravitational wave background generated by binary neutron star mergers, and confirm that the overall background can be significantly influenced by relatively few neighboring, loud events. To mitigate the shot noise, we propose a procedure to remove nearby events by notching them out in the time-frequency domain. Additionally, we quantify the cosmic/sample variance of the resulting background after notching, and we study the deviation between the cross-correlation measurement and the theoretical prediction of the background. Taking both effects into account, we find that the resulting sensitivity loss in the search for an isotropic background formed by binary neutron star mergers is minimal, and is limited to $\lesssim 4\%$ below 40 Hz, and to $\lesssim 1\%$ above 40 Hz.

In this paper we propose a two-field model of warm inflation motivated from a heterotic string construction. The model contains an axion and a dilaton-like field. We show that while warm inflation can take place in the axion-field direction, thermal corrections coming from the radiation gauge fields, which couples to both the axion and the dilaton, prevent warm inflation to happen in the dilaton-field direction. We explore the background dynamics for different parameters, and identify a diversity of dynamical behaviors allowed in this model, denoting different regimes of warm inflation.

We explore the timing and spectral properties of GRS 1915+105 based on X-ray observations of NICER and Insight-HXMT during the long outburst from 2017 to 2021. We find a new class of variability in the rising stage of the outburst that differs from the formerly reported patterns of light curves. This new variability pattern, which we name class $\psi$, is characterized by several periodic mini pulses superposed on another longer periodic pulse. The periods are around $\sim$130 seconds and $\sim$10 seconds for the main pulses and mini pulses respectively based on the analysis of power spectrum density (PSD) and step-wise filter correlation (SFC), where the SFC method has an advantage in finding the superimposed periodic components. The mini pulses become weak or disappear when the luminosity increases and the light curves change into the classical class $\kappa$. The class $\psi$ shows a softer spectrum with lower count rates compared to the class $\kappa$ during the main pulse. The new class $\psi$ shows peculiar timing and spectral properties compared to those of classic class $\kappa$, which can help us to explore the class transition mechanism in GRS 1915+105.

Recent results of the event horizon-scale images of M87* and Sagittarius A* from the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration show that strong magnetic fields are likely present around the central black holes (BHs) in these sources. Magnetically arrested disks (MADs), the end stage of magnetic flux saturation around BHs, are especially rich in horizon-scale physics due to the presence of powerful jets and magnetic flux eruptions that provide significant feedback on the accretion mechanism. Here, we present an overview of our current knowledge about the magnetic field evolution in numerical simulations of accreting BHs, focusing on jet launching, black hole-interstellar medium feedback, and black hole imaging of MADs. We find that misaligned MAD accretion flows seemingly exhibit jet ejection cycles that could produce flaring states in radio-quiet active galactic nuclei. Further, we show that advances in horizon-scale interferometric telescopes could identify disk misalignment by imaging the disk-jet connection region.

We search for the stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) predicted by pre-big-bang (PBB) cosmology using data from the first three observing runs of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo. PBB cosmology proposes an alternative to cosmic inflation where the Universe evolves from a weak-coupling, low-curvature state to the hot Big Bang through a high-curvature bounce phase, predicting a distinctive SGWB spectrum. We perform a Bayesian analysis of the cross-correlation data to constrain the model parameters characterizing the PBB spectrum. We find no evidence for a PBB-induced SGWB, with a Bayes factor of $0.03$ between the PBB and noise-only model, strongly favoring the noise-only hypothesis. Our analysis establishes a lower bound $\beta \gtrsim -0.19$ at $95\%$ confidence level, which is compatible with the theoretical requirement $\beta \geq 0$ for a smooth bounce transition. While we do not detect a signal, our constraints remain consistent with the basic theoretical framework of PBB cosmology, demonstrating the potential of gravitational-wave observations to test early Universe theories.

High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE)
Binary black holes (BBH) are expected to form and merge in active galactic nuclei (AGN), deep in the potential well of a supermassive black hole (SMBH), from populations that exist in a nuclear star cluster (NSC). Here we investigate the gravitational wave (GW) signature of a BBH lensed by a nearby SMBH. For a fiducial GW150914-like BBH orbiting close to a $10^{8}M_{\odot}$ SMBH located at $z=0.1$, the lensed GW signal varies in a predictable manner in and out of the LISA detectability band and across frequencies. The occurrence of such signatures has the potential to confound LISA global fit models if they are not modelled. Detection of these sources provide an independent measure of AGN inclination angles, along with detecting warping of the inner disk, and measuring the SMBH spin.

In this second paper on our variability survey of central stars of planetary nebulae (CSPNe) using ZTF, we report 11 long-timescale variables with variability timescales ranging from months to years. We also present preliminary analyses based on spectroscopic and/or photometric follow-up observations for six of them. Among them is NGC 6833, which shows a $980$ day periodic variability with strange characteristics: `triangle-shaped' brightening in $r$, $i$, and WISE bands but almost coincidental shallow dips in the $g$-band. The most plausible explanation is a wide binary with the photometric period being the orbital period. Long-period near-sinusoidal variability was detected in two other systems, NGC 6905 and Kn 26, with periods of $700$ days and $230$ days, respectively, making them additional wide-binary candidates. The latter also shows a short period at $1.18$ hours. We then present CTSS 2 and K 3-5, which show brightening and significant reddening over the whole ZTF baseline. A stellar model fit to the optical spectrum of CTSS 2 reveals it to be one of the youngest post-AGB CSPNe known. Both show high-density emission-line cores. We propose these to be late-thermal-pulse candidates, currently evolving towards the AGB phase. We then present recent HST/COS ultraviolet spectroscopy of the known wide-binary candidate LoTr 1, showing that the hot star is a spectroscopic twin of the extremely hot white dwarf in UCAC2 46706450. Similar to this object, LoTr 1 also has a fast-rotating wide subgiant companion. We suggest that the long photometric period of 11 years is the binary orbital period. Finally, we briefly discuss the ZTF light curves of the remaining variables, namely Tan 2, K 3-20, WHTZ 3, Kn J1857+3931, and IPHAS J1927+0814. With these examples, we present the effectiveness of the von Neumann statistics and Pearson Skew-based metric space in searching for long-timescale variables.

We explore the effect of variations in the Population III (Pop III) initial mass function (IMF) and star-by-star feedback on early galaxy formation and evolution using the Aeos simulations. We compare simulations with two different Pop III IMFs: $M_\text{char} = 10 \, \mathrm{M}_\odot$ and $M_{\rm max} = 100 \, \mathrm{M}_\odot$ (Aeos10) and $M_\text{char} = 20 \, \mathrm{M}_\odot$ and $M_{\rm max} = 300 \, \mathrm{M}_\odot$ (Aeos20). Aeos20 produces significantly more ionizing photons, ionizing 30% of the simulation volume by $z \approx 14$, compared to 9% in Aeos10. This enhanced ionization suppresses galaxy formation on the smallest scales. Differences in Pop III IMF also affect chemical enrichment. Aeos20 produces Population II (Pop II) stars with higher abundances, relative to iron, of light and $\alpha$-elements, a stronger odd-even effect, and a higher frequency of carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars. The abundance scatter between different Pop II galaxies dominates the differences due to Pop III IMF, though, implying a need for a larger sample of Pop II stars to interpret the impact of Pop III IMF on early chemical evolution. We also compare the Aeos simulations to traditional simulations that use single stellar population particles. We find that star-by-star modeling produces a steeper mass-metallicity relation due to less bursty feedback. These results highlight the strong influence of the Pop III IMF on early galaxy formation and chemical evolution, emphasizing the need to account for IMF uncertainties in simulations and the importance of metal-poor Pop II stellar chemical abundances when studying the first stars.

The integral-field unit mode of the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec+IFU) mounted on the James Webb Space Telescope has now enabled kinematic studies of smaller and less massive compact stellar systems in which to search for central massive black holes (BHs) than ever before. We present here the first such detection using NIRSpec+IFU in its highest resolution (R~2700) mode. We report a $3\sigma$ detection of a central black hole with mass ${\cal M}_{BH}=2.2\pm1.1\times10^6\,M_\odot$ in UCD736 orbiting within the Virgo galaxy cluster based on Schwarzschild's modeling of the 1D kinematic profile. The presence of such a massive BH strongly argues against a globular cluster origin of this UCD, and rather suggests a tidally stripped formation route from a former $\gtrsim10^9\,M_\odot$ dwarf galaxy host. Two other methods produce results consistent with Schwarzschild's modelling, but can only provide upper-limits on ${\cal M}_{BH}$. This represents the detection of a BH in the most compact ($r_h\approx15\,{\rm pc}$) stellar system to date, with a ${\cal M}_{BH}$ corresponding to ~9 percent of the system's stellar mass, roughly in line with previously reported UCD BH detections and comparable to the BH detected in the compact elliptical galaxy NGC4486B.

The Einstein Telescope (ET), a proposed next-generation gravitational wave (GW) observatory, will expand the reach of GW astronomy of stellar-mass compact object binaries to unprecedented distances, enhancing opportunities for multi-messenger observations. Here we investigate multi-messenger emission properties of binary neutron star (NSNS) and black hole-neutron star (BHNS) mergers detectable by ET, providing projections to optimize observational strategies and maximize scientific insights from these sources. Using a synthetic population of compact binary mergers, we model each source's GW signal-to-noise ratio, sky localization uncertainty, kilonova (KN) light curves in optical and near-infrared bands, fluence of the relativistic jet gamma-ray burst (GRB) prompt emission and afterglow light curves across radio, optical, X-ray and very high energy wavelengths. We analyze multi-messenger detectability prospects for ET as a standalone observatory with two different configurations and within a network of next-generation GW detectors. ET will detect over $10^4$ NSNS mergers annually, enabling potential observation of tens to hundreds of electromagnetic (EM) counterparts. BHNS mergers have more limited multi-messenger prospects, but joint GW-EM rates will increase by an order of magnitude compared to current-generation instruments. We quantify uncertainties due to the NS equation of state (EoS) and mass distribution of NSNSs, as well as the NS EoS and BH spin for BHNSs. While a single ET will achieve an impressive GW detection rate, the fraction of well-localized events is orders of magnitude lower than in a network with additional detectors. This significantly limits efficient EM follow-up and science cases requiring well-characterized counterparts or early observations. The challenge is even greater for BHNS mergers due to their low EM rate.

The Fornax cluster is one of the closest X-ray-bright galaxy clusters. Previous observations of the intracluster medium were limited to less than R500. We aim to significantly extend the X-ray coverage. We used data from 5 SRG/eROSITA all-sky surveys and performed a detailed 1- and 2-dimensional X-ray surface brightness analysis, tracing hot gas emission from kpc to Mpc scales with a single instrument. We compared the results to those from a recent numerical simulation of the local Universe (SLOW) and correlated the X-ray emission distribution with that of other tracers, including cluster member galaxies, ultra-compact dwarf galaxies, intracluster globular clusters, and HI-tail galaxies. We detect X-ray emission beyond the virial radius, R100=2.2 deg. In the inner regions within R500, we see previously known features, such as a large-scale spiral-shaped edge; however, we do not find obvious evidence of the bow shock several hundred kpc south of the cluster center predicted by previous numerical simulations of the Fornax cluster. Instead, we discover emission fingers beyond R500 to the west and southeast and excesses that stretch out far beyond the virial radius. They might be due to gas being pushed outward by the previous merger with NGC 1404 or due to warm-hot gas infall along large-scale filaments. Intriguingly, we find the distributions of the other tracers - galaxies and globular clusters - to be correlated with the X-ray-excess regions, favoring the infall scenario. Interestingly, we also discover an apparent bridge of low-surface-brightness emission beyond the virial radius connecting to the Fornax A galaxy group, which is also traced by the member galaxy and globular cluster distribution. The gas distribution in the SLOW simulation shows similar features as those we have discovered with eROSITA. With eROSITA, we witness the growth of a cluster along large-scale filaments.

We consider models of inflation that contain a transient non-slow-roll stage and investigate the conditions under which a dip appears in the power spectrum of the curvature perturbation. Using the $\delta N$ formalism, we derive a general relation between the comoving curvature perturbation ${\cal{R}}$ and the scalar field perturbation $\delta\varphi$ and its velocity perturbation $\delta\pi$. Compared with the result obtained in linear perturbation theory, it turns out that properly taking account of the $\delta\pi$ contribution is essential to reproduce the dip in the power spectrum. Namely, the curvature perturbation is proportional to a specific linear combination of $\delta\varphi$ and $\delta\pi$ at the linear order. We also investigate the non-linearity at the dip scale and find that models with a bump or an upward step exhibit much larger non-linearity than ultra-slow-roll and Starobinsky's linear potential models. Finally, we demonstrate the importance of non-linearity by computing the probability density functions (PDFs) for the above-mentioned models and show that highly asymmetric PDFs are realised for models with a bump or a step.

We present the weak-lensing mass calibration and constrain the BCG (brightest cluster galaxy) stellar-mass-to-halo-mass-and-redshift ($M_{\star,\mathrm{BCG}}-M-z$) relation for a sample of $124$ galaxy clusters and groups at redshift $0.1<z<0.8$ from the first Data Release of the $eROSITA$ All-Sky Survey (eRASS1), using data from the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Subaru Strategic Program. The cluster survey is conducted by the $eROSITA$ X-ray telescope aboard the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) space observatory. The cluster sample is X-ray-selected and optically confirmed with a negligibly low contamination rate ($\approx5%$). On a basis of individual clusters, the shear profiles of $96$ clusters are derived using the HSC Three-Year (HSC-Y3) weak-lensing data, while the BCG stellar masses of $101$ clusters are estimated using the SED template fitting to the HSC five-band ($grizY$) photometry. The observed X-ray photon count rate is used as the mass proxy, based on which individual halo masses are obtained at the given count rate in a population modelling while accounting for systematic uncertainties in the weak-lensing modelling through a simulation-calibrated weak-lensing mass-to-halo-mass relation. The count rate and BCG stellar mass relations are simultaneously constrained in a forward and population modelling. In agreement with the results based on the weak-lensing data from the DES and KiDS surveys, we obtain a count rate relation with a self-similar redshift scaling and a mass trend that is steeper than the self-similar prediction. Our results suggest that the BCG stellar mass at a fixed halo mass has remained stable with a moderate increase at a level of $\left(20\pm8\right)%$ since redshift $z\approx0.8$. This finding supports the picture of the ``rapid-then-slow'' BCG formation, where the majority of the stellar mass must have been assembled at much earlier cosmic time.

Elusive intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) can be used as ``time-squeezing'' machines, enabling studies of AGN geometry via reverberation mapping on much shorter timescales than their supermassive siblings. Constraints on the BLR radius for IMBH candidates across a broad range of Eddington ratios help probe the unexplored faint end of the radius-luminosity ($R-L$) relation in AGNs. This opens up the opportunity to build a more robust $M_{BH}$ estimator. The present study is aimed at: (a) confirming a highly accreting IMBH candidate and (b) demonstrating the feasibility of the first photometric BLR RM campaign for IMBHs with high Eddington rates. SDSS J144850.08+160803.1 was identified as an IMBH candidate from a broad H$\alpha$-selected spectroscopic sample from SDSS. We carried out XMM-Newton X-ray observations to confirm its AGN status, along with narrowband H$\alpha$ and broadband SDSS g' monitoring over five months (March-July 2024) using a 60-cm telescope at the Caucasus Mountain Observatory. These time series allowed us both to probe the short-timescale variability and extract the time lag between the BLR and AD continuum. XMM-Newton detected J1448+16 as a bright X-ray point source with a photon index of $\Gamma = 2.32^{+0.15}_{-0.13}$ and X-ray luminosity of $L_{2-10\,\rm{keV}}=(3.3^{+0.5}_{-0.4})\times10^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$, confirming its AGN activity. From the SDSS optical spectrum and X-ray properties, we estimated a BH mass of $\sim(0.9-2.4)~\times10^{5}M_{\odot}$ and Eddington rate of $\sim37-112\%$. We report high-amplitude $\sim55\%$ intra-night ($\sim1.7$~h) H$\alpha$ variability for this IMBH and extract a tentative BLR RM radius estimate of $\sim1-8~\mathrm{days}$. This work is a proof of concept for further high-Eddington-rate IMBH variability studies and BLR RM campaigns, which will be essential for an efficient calibration of the $R-L$ relation at the faint end.

In recent years, shear catalogs have been released by various Stage-III weak lensing surveys including the Kilo-Degree Survey, the Dark Energy Survey, and the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program. These shear catalogs have undergone rigorous validation tests to ensure that the residual shear systematic effects in the catalogs are subdominant relative to the statistical uncertainties, such that the resulting cosmological constraints are unbiased. While there exists a generic set of tests that are designed to probe certain systematic effects, the implementations differ slightly across the individual surveys, making it difficult to make direct comparisons. In this paper, we use the TXPipe package to conduct a series of predefined diagnostic tests across three public shear catalogs -- the 1,000 deg$^2$ KiDS-1000 shear catalog, the Year 3 DES-Y3 shear catalog, and the Year 3 HSC-Y3 shear catalog. We attempt to reproduce the published results when possible and perform key tests uniformly across the surveys. While all surveys pass most of the null tests in this study, we find two tests where some of the surveys fail. Namely, we find that when measuring the tangential ellipticity around bright and faint star samples, KiDS-1000 fails with a \chi^2$/dof of 121.1/16 and 257.7/16 for bins 4 and 5 for faint, weighted stars. We also find that DES-Y3 and HSC-Y3 fail the $B$-mode test when estimated with the Hybrid-$E$/$B$ method, with a $\chi^2$/dof of 37.9/10 and 36.0/8 for the fourth and third autocorrelation bins. We assess the impacts on the $\Omega_{\rm m}$ - S$_{8}$ parameter space by comparing the posteriors of a simulated data vector with and without PSF contamination -- we find negligible effects in all cases. Finally, we propose strategies for performing these tests on future surveys such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time.

Surface magnetic fields are detected in less than $10\%$ of the massive O-type star population and even less frequently among `old' massive stars approaching the terminal-age main sequence (TAMS). It is unclear to what extent the rarity of magnetic detections in massive stars near the TAMS is due to magnetic field decay or observational biases. We report the detection of a weak surface magnetic field in the O-type giant 63~Oph ($T_{\mathrm{eff}}=35.0\pm0.3\,$kK, $\log g=3.51\pm0.03$) from new ESPaDOnS circularly polarized spectra. The mean longitudinal field strength associated with the magnetic detection is $\langle B_{z}\rangle=84\pm14\,$G, which we use to set a lower limit on the dipolar field strength of $B_{\mathrm{p}}\geq300\pm50\,$G. We report Balmer line equivalent widths (EW) and radial velocity (RV) measurements from the analysis of spectra primarily obtained by the IACOB project with the FEROS, FIES and HERMES spectrographs. We identify a dominant period of $\sim19.8\,$d in the EWs which we attribute to the effects of a rotating magnetosphere under the Oblique Rotator Model. We do not identify any coherent signals in a time-series analysis of archival Hipparcos, ASAS-SN and K2 photometry. Our findings show that 63~Oph may be a rare link between strongly magnetic massive stars detected on or near the zero-age main sequence and weakly-magnetic O-type supergiants. Additional observations are needed to fully constrain 63~Oph's magnetic field geometry and magnetospheric properties.

ESA's Euclid cosmology mission relies on the very sensitive and accurately calibrated spectroscopy channel of the Near-Infrared Spectrometer and Photometer (NISP). With three operational grisms in two wavelength intervals, NISP provides diffraction-limited slitless spectroscopy over a field of $0.57$ deg$^2$. A blue grism $\text{BG}_\text{E}$ covers the wavelength range $926$--$1366$\,nm at a spectral resolution $R=440$--$900$ for a $0.5''$ diameter source with a dispersion of $1.24$ nm px$^{-1}$. Two red grisms $\text{RG}_\text{E}$ span $1206$ to $1892$\,nm at $R=550$--$740$ and a dispersion of $1.37$ nm px$^{-1}$. We describe the construction of the grisms as well as the ground testing of the flight model of the NISP instrument where these properties were established.

Self-gravity in thin protoplanetary discs: 1. The smoothing-length approximation versus the exact self-gravity kernel

Planet-forming discs often contain structures like spiral arms, typically linked to the disc's gravitational forces. In 2D models, an ad hoc softening prescription is commonly used for self-gravity, but this overlooks the vertical structure's impact, suppresses the Newtonian nature of gravity at short distances and doesn't respect Newton's third law.
To address these issues, associated with a Plummer potential approximation, we developed an exact self-gravity kernel for thin, hydrostatically supported discs, including a dust fluid component. Our analytical framework provides a precise 2D self-gravity prescription validated by benchmarks and 2D/3D numerical tests.
The derived kernel, based on modified Bessel functions, maintains Newtonian gravitation features, such as point-wise symmetry, a smooth transition from light to massive discs and a singularity at zero distance, among others. In contrast to other prescriptions found in the literature, it proves capable of leading to an additional, and previously unnoticed, source of gravitational runaway discernible only at infinitesimal distances.
We finally note that our new prescription remains compatible with methods based on the fast Fourier transform, affording superior computational efficiency. Our exact kernel formulation overcomes substantial limitations inherent in the smoothing-length approach. It permits a novel, fully consistent treatment of self-gravity in Gaussian-stratified thin discs. The approach, that makes the usage of the Plummer potential obsolete, will prove useful to studying all common planet formation scenarios, which are often backed by 2D-flat numerical simulations. Accordingly, in an accompanying paper, we will investigate how the occurence of the gravitational instability is affected.

Testing Coasting Cosmologies with Large-Scale Structure Growth

Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO)
We derive analytical expressions for the growth factor, $D(z)$, and density-weighted growth rate, $f\sigma_8(z)$, for coasting cosmologies, in which the scale factor is a linear function of time. We fit the latter to data from redshift space distortion measurements in the redshift range $z<2$ using the \texttt{dynesty} implementation of a nested sampling algorithm. In total, four models are tested: three coasting models with curvature parameters ${k=\{-1, 0, +1\}}$ in $H^2_0c^{-2}$ units, as well as a flat $\Lambda$CDM model. We evaluate each model's consistency with the data by applying an Anderson-Darling test for normality on the normalized residuals. For the coasting models, we obtained ${\Omega_\mathrm{m,0}=\{ 0.206^{+0.073}_{-0.061},\, 0.297^{+0.085}_{-0.073},\, 0.412^{+0.097}_{-0.086}}\}$ and ${\sigma_{8}(z=0)=\{1.071^{+0.213}_{-0.151},\,0.867^{+0.128}_{-0.097},\,0.725^{+0.080}_{-0.065}\}}$. Fitting the $\Lambda$CDM model yielded ${\{\Omega_\mathrm{m,0}=0.286_{-0.047}^{+0.053},\,\sigma_{8}(z=0)= 0.764_{-0.035}^{+0.039}\}}$. All four models are consistent with the data, though coasting models are weakly favored over the $\Lambda$CDM model, with $\log$-Bayes factors of ${\log_{10}{\mathcal{B}} = \{0.197,\, 0.234,\,0.272\}}$. We also examined whether the $S_8$ tension can be resolved by linear expansion restricted to $z<2$. The curve fitting yielded ${S_8=\{0.890^{+0.024}_{-0.024},\,0.865^{+0.024}_{-0.024},\,0.850^{+0.026}_{-0.026}\}}$ for the ${k=\{-1, 0, +1\}}$ coasting models, respectively, resulting in ${\Delta S^\mathrm{Coasting}_8=\{1.94\sigma,\,1.07\sigma,\,0.52\sigma\}}$ discrepancies with the standard $\textit{Planck}$ 2018 value. The tension level was the highest for the $\Lambda$CDM model, as the constraint from our fit is $S_8=0.746^{+0.041}_{-0.039}$, indicating a tension level of ${\Delta S_8^{\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}}=2.00\sigma}$.

We present an extension of the pop-cosmos model for the evolving galaxy population up to redshift $z\sim6$. The model is trained on distributions of observed colors and magnitudes, from 26-band photometry of $\sim420,000$ galaxies in the COSMOS2020 catalog with Spitzer IRAC $\textit{Ch. 1}<26$. The generative model includes a flexible distribution over 16 stellar population synthesis (SPS) parameters, and a depth-dependent photometric uncertainty model, both represented using score-based diffusion models. We use the trained model to predict scaling relationships for the galaxy population, such as the stellar mass function, star-forming main sequence, and gas-phase and stellar metallicity vs. mass relations, demonstrating reasonable-to-excellent agreement with previously published results. We explore the connection between mid-infrared emission from active galactic nuclei (AGN) and star-formation rate, finding high AGN activity for galaxies above the star-forming main sequence at $1\lesssim z\lesssim 2$. Using the trained population model as a prior distribution, we perform inference of the redshifts and SPS parameters for 429,669 COSMOS2020 galaxies, including 39,588 with publicly available spectroscopic redshifts. The resulting redshift estimates exhibit minimal bias ($\text{median}[\Delta_z]=-8\times10^{-4}$), scatter ($\sigma_\text{MAD}=0.0132$), and outlier fraction ($6.19\%$) for the full $0<z<6$ spectroscopic compilation. These results establish that pop-cosmos can achieve the accuracy and realism needed to forward-model modern wide--deep surveys for Stage IV cosmology. We publicly release pop-cosmos software, mock galaxy catalogs, and COSMOS2020 redshift and SPS parameter posteriors.

We present a geometric embedding method that exploits the exact kinematic relation $\dot{z} = H_0(1 + z) - H(z)$ to transform redshift misalignment between Cosmic Chronometer (CC) and Sandage-Loeb (SL) datasets into fundamental constraints in observable space. The approach recognizes that $H_0$ encodes the orientation of the FLRW observational plane defined by $(z, H(z), \dot{z})$ coordinates, enabling direct algebraic determination without parametric assumptions or interpolation schemes. Validation using available CC measurements and forecasted redshift drift data from FAST, CHIME, SKA, and ELT demonstrates 1.9\% precision for optimal data combinations, yielding $H_0 = 66.26 \pm 1.26$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ while maintaining complete cosmological model independence. While no actual SL measurements currently exist, requiring us to rely on simulations for validation, our geometric constraints show superior resilience against sparse redshift coverage compared to Gaussian Process (GP) methods, which exhibit systematic biases and large uncertainties when datasets lack substantial overlap. This kinematic framework establishes geometric embedding as a robust tool for precision cosmological measurements, offering a fundamentally different approach to $H_0$ determination through pure observational analysis based on FLRW kinematic principles. The full potential of this method awaits implementation with real SL measurements from next-generation facilities.

Detecting orbital eccentricity in a stellar-mass black-hole merger would point to a non-isolated formation channel. Eccentric binaries can form in dense stellar environments such as globular clusters or active galactic nuclei, or from triple stellar systems in the Galactic field. However, confidently measuring eccentricity is challenging -- short signals from high-mass eccentric mergers can mimic spin-induced precession, making the two effects hard to disentangle. This degeneracy weakens considerably for longer-duration signals. Here, GW200208_222617 provides a rare opportunity. Originating from a relatively low-mass binary with source-frame chirp mass $\sim20$ M$_\odot$, its gravitational-wave signal spanned $\sim14$ orbital cycles in band, with no indication of data quality issues. Previous analyses for quasi-circular binaries found no evidence for spin precession, and multiple subsequent studies found the data to favour an eccentric merger despite notable technical differences. All in all, we believe GW200208_222617 is the black-hole merger event from GWTC-3 with the least ambiguous detection of eccentricity. We present a critical discussion of properties and astrophysical interpretation of GW200208_222617 as an eccentric black-hole merger using models of field triples, globular clusters, and active galactic nuclei. We find that if GW200208_222617 was indeed eccentric, its origin is consistent with a field triple or globular cluster. Formation in the inner regions of an active galactic nucleus is disfavoured. The outer regions of such a disk remain a viable origin for GW200208_222617; we demonstrate how future detections of eccentric mergers formed in such environments could be powerful tools for constraining the disk geometry.

POEMMA-Balloon with Radio (PBR) is a scaled-down version of the Probe Of Extreme Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (POEMMA) design, optimized to be flown as a payload on one of NASA's sub-orbital super pressure balloons circling the Earth above the southern oceans for a mission duration of more than 20 days. One of the main science objectives of PBR is to follow up astrophysical event alerts in search of neutrinos with very high energy ($10^8 \lesssim E_\nu /{\rm GeV} \lesssim 10^{10}$). Of particular interest for anticipated PBR observations, the KM3NeT Collaboration has recently reported the detection of the neutrino KM3-230213A with $10^{7.8} \lesssim E_\nu/{\rm GeV} \lesssim 10^{9.0}$. Such an unprecedented event is in tension with upper limits on the cosmic neutrino flux from IceCube and the Pierre Auger Observatory: for a diffuse isotropic neutrino flux there is a $3.5\sigma$ tension between KM3NeT and IceCube measurements, and about $2.6\sigma$ if the neutrino flux originates in transient sources. Therefore, if KM3-230213A was not beginner's luck, it becomes compelling to consider beyond Standard Model (BSM) possibilities which could lead to a signal at KM3NeT-ARCA but not at IceCube/Auger. We calculate the PBR horizon-range sensitivity to probe BSM physics compatible with observation at KM3NeT-ARCA and non-observation at IceCube/Auger. As an illustration, we consider a particular class of BSM physics models which has been described in the literature as a possible explanation of KM3-230213A.

The identification of potential sources of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) remains challenging due to magnetic deflections and propagation losses, which are particularly strong for nuclei. In previous iterations of this work, we proposed an approach for UHECR astronomy based on Bayesian inference through explicit modelling of propagation and magnetic deflection effects. The event-by-event mass information is expected to provide tighter constraints on these parameters and to help identify unknown sources. However, the measurements of the average mass through observations from the surface detectors at the Pierre Auger Observatory already indicate that the UHECR masses are well represented through its statistical average. In this contribution, we present our framework which uses energy and mass moments of $\ln A$ to infer the source parameters of UHECRs, including the mass composition at the source. We demonstrate the performance of our model using simulated datasets based on the Pierre Auger Observatory and Telescope Array Project. Our model can be readily applied to currently available data, and we discuss the implications of our results for UHECR source identification.

Jet-Driven Formation of Bipolar Rings in Planetary Nebulae: Numerical Simulations Inspired by NGC 1514

We conduct three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of jets launched into a dense shell, reproducing two rings in a bipolar structure that resemble the two dusty rings of the planetary nebula (PN) NGC 1514. The scenario we simulate assumes that a strong binary interaction enhanced the mass loss rate from the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stellar progenitor of NGC 1514, and shortly thereafter, the main-sequence companion accreted mass from the AGB star, launching a pair of jets. We find that adiabatic flows, where radiative losses are negligible, produce prominent rings, as observed in the infrared in NGC 1514. In contrast, when radiative cooling is significant, the rings are thin and faint. Our results reinforce the prevailing notion that jets play a substantial role in shaping planetary nebulae (PNe). More generally, as the binary companion to the central star of NGC 1514 avoided common envelope evolution, our results suggest that jets play a major role in many binary systems experiencing stable mass transfer at high rates. This conclusion complements the view that jets play a significant role in unstable mass transfer, specifically in common envelope evolution. Studies of strongly interacting binary systems, whether stable or not, should include jets. If jets continue to be active after ring formation, the outcomes are circum-jet rings, as observed in some other PNe and core-collapse supernova remnants.

We present CLARA, a modular framework for unsupervised transit detection in TESS light curves, leveraging Unsupervised Random Forests (URFs) trained on synthetic datasets and guided by morphological similarity analysis. This work addresses two core questions: (a) How does the design of synthetic training sets affect the performance and generalization of URFs across independent TESS sectors? (b) Do URF anomaly scores correlate with genuine astrophysical phenomena, enabling effective identification and clustering of transit-like signals? We investigate these questions through a two-part study focused on (1) detection performance optimization, and (2) the physical interpretability of anomalies. In Part I, we introduce three URF model variants tuned via alpha-controlled scoring objectives, and evaluate their generalization across five TESS sectors. This large-scale test involved scoring 384,000 individual light curves (128,000 light curves per alpha variant), revealing stable, interpretable differences between recall-optimized, precision-optimized, and balanced models. In Part II, our optimized clustering (DPMM Cluster 2) yields a 14.04% detection rate (16 confirmed transits among 114 candidates) from the first five TESS SPOC sectors. This reflects a substantial enrichment over baseline rates: 0.4569% for the full TESS-SPOC project candidate set (7658 candidates across 1.68 million light curves), and 0.2650% for the FFI-based SPOC sample (7658 candidates across 2.89 million light curves;). Additionally, we perform Monte Carlo injection-recovery tests to assess feasibility, stability, justification and quantification of methods outlined. CLARA processed over 87,000 TESS SPOC light curves (Sectors 1-5).

We present a combined analysis of the Pythia 8 event generator using accelerator data and evaluate its impact on air shower observables. Reliable simulations with event generators are essential for particle physics analyses, achievable through advanced tuning to experimental data. Pythia 8 has emerged as a promising high-energy interaction model for cosmic ray air shower simulations, offering well-documented parameter settings and a user-friendly interface to enable automatic tuning efforts. Using data from collider and fixed-target experiments, we first derive tunes for each domain separately, before tuning both domains simultaneously. To achieve this, we define a core set of observables and quantify their dependence on selected parameters. The tuning efforts are based on gradient descent and Bayesian methods, the latter providing a full uncertainty propagation of the parameters to the observables. Results for the impact of a combined analysis for the Pythia 8/Angantyr event generator on air shower observables, such as particle densities at ground level and energy deposit profiles, are presented.

Knowledge of the mass composition of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECR) is crucial to understanding their origins; however, current approaches have limited event-by-event resolution due to high intrinsic fluctuations of variables like $X_{\mathrm{max}}$ and $N_\mu$. With fluorescence telescope measurements of $X_{\mathrm{max}}$ in particular, there are opportunities to improve this situation by leveraging more information from the longitudinal shower development profile beyond just the depth at which its maximum occurs. Although there have been ML studies on extracting composition or mass groups from surface signals, parametrized profiles, or from derived parameters (e.g. $X_{\mathrm{max}}$ distributions), to our knowledge, we present the first study of a deep-learning neural-network approach to directly predict a primary's mass ($\ln A$) from the full longitudinal energy-deposit profile of simulated extensive air showers. We train and validate our model on a large suite of simulated showers, generated with CONEX and EPOS-LHC, covering nuclei from $A = 1$ to $61$, sampled uniformly in $\ln A$. After rescaling, our network achieves a maximum bias better than 0.4 in $\ln A$ on unseen test showers with a resolution ranging between 1.5 for protons and 1 for iron over a large range of noise conditions, corresponding to a proton-iron merit factor of 2.19, outperforming the predictive power of either $X_{\mathrm{max}}$ or $N_\mu$ alone. This performance is only mildly degraded when predictions are made on simulations using the Sibyll-2.3d hadronic interaction model, which was not used in training, showing these features are robust against model choice. Our results suggest that the full shower profile may contain latent composition-sensitive features which have as much discriminating power as $X_{\mathrm{max}}$.

We detail the population properties of merging compact objects using 158 mergers from the cumulative Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog 4.0, which includes three types of binary mergers: binary neutron star, neutron star--black hole binary, and binary black hole mergers. We resolve multiple over- and under-densities in the black hole mass distribution: features persist at primary masses of $10\,M_\odot$ and $35\,M_\odot$ with a possible third feature at $\sim 20\,M_\odot$. These are departures from an otherwise power-law-like continuum that steepens above $35\,M_\odot$. Binary black holes with primary masses near $10\,M_\odot$ are more likely to have less massive secondaries, with a mass ratio distribution peaking at $q = 0.74^{+0.13}_{-0.13}$, potentially a signature of stable mass transfer during binary evolution. Black hole spins are inferred to be non-extremal, with 90\% of black holes having $\chi < 0.57$, and preferentially aligned with binary orbits, implying many merging binaries form in isolation. However, we find a significant fraction, 0.24--0.42, of binaries have negative effective inspiral spins, suggesting many could be formed dynamically in gas-free environments. We find evidence for correlation between effective inspiral spin and mass ratio, though it is unclear if this is driven by variation in the mode of the distribution or the width. (Abridged)

The ALMA-QUARKS survey: Extensive detection of acetamide in multiple high-mass star-forming regions

Acetamide (CH$_{3}$CONH$_{2}$), a key interstellar amide and a methyl derivative of formamide (NH$_{2}$CHO), has been sparsely detected, limiting insights into its prebiotic relevance. We present the first systematic survey for acetamide toward 52 hot molecular cores using ALMA Band 6 data. Acetamide has been detected in 10 cores, markedly expanding the inventory of known emitters. The derived column densities of acetamide range from $(2.5\pm0.9)\times10^{14}$ to $(1.5\pm0.6)\times10^{16}$ cm$^{-2}$, compared to formamide's $(1.1\pm0.1)\times10^{15}$ to $(6.9\pm0.4)\times10^{16}$ cm$^{-2}$. The nearly constant abundance ratios (~3-9) and strong abundance correlation between the two amides across sources suggest a chemically linked formation pathway, likely on grain surfaces. The presence of peptide-like molecules in these regions implies that complex organic species can survive star formation processes, offering a potential pathway toward prebiotic chemistry. These findings constrain the dominant grain surface formation routes of acetamide, confirm its broader prevalence in highmass star-forming regions, and underscore the importance of targeted amide surveys in tracing the chemical evolution toward prebiotic complexity.

We present lithium abundances for 119 main-sequence stars in the old open cluster NGC 188 (age = 6.3 Gyr), using high-resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio spectra from WIYN/Hydra. We observe the stars over multiple nights and measure radial velocities for each night, which we combine with Gaia proper motions to identify multiplicity and cluster membership. We identify 95 single members, 14 binary members, 9 members with uncertain multiplicity, and 1 single likely member. We determine effective temperatures using empirical color-temperature relations, surface gravities from isochrones, and microturbulence from empirical relations for main-sequence stars. Our sample includes G and K dwarfs with temperatures between 6000 and 5300 K, which expands significantly on earlier observations. We find that lithium abundances in NGC 188 are lower than predictions from standard stellar evolution theory. As expected, stars in NGC 188 are more lithium-depleted than those in the younger Hyades and Praesepe clusters (650 Myr). However, their abundances are higher, or at least comparable, to those in the slightly younger cluster M67 (4.5 Gyr), challenging the idea that older stars have lower lithium than younger ones. Lithium depletion may depend on factors beyond age and mass, such as metallicity.

While astronomical twilight closes the observing window for optical astronomers, the infrared sky remains dark even through sunrise, allowing IR astronomers to observe through twilight. The Slicer Combined with an Array of Lenslets for Exoplanet Spectroscopy (SCALES) instrument is a 2-5 micron coronagraphic integral field spectrograph scheduled to arrive at Keck in early 2026. SCALES has the potential to execute exciting science and support the astronomical community and upcoming NASA missions through a dedicated cadenced twilight observing program. We estimate that the current twilight observing program on Keck conducts 18+-1 hours per year of science observations; a facilitized twilight observing program that is prioritized by the observatory could yield 151+-2 hours of science time per year. This work presents the scientific motivation and high-level feasibility of two primary SCALES twilight science cases, monitoring of Solar System objects and a high-contrast imaging search for exoplanets around bright nearby stars, taking lessons from the existing NIRC2 and OSIRIS Twilight Zone program and considering increases in program scope. We also consider technical and operational challenges to overcome before the SCALES instrument begins its twilight observing program.

In multiple-planet systems, gravitational interactions of exoplanets could lead to transit timing variations (TTVs), whose amplitude becomes significantly enhanced when planets are in or near mean-motion resonances (MMRs). In cases where both TTVs and radial velocity (RV) measurements are available, combined analysis can break degeneracies and provide robust planetary and system characterization, even detecting non-transiting planets. In this context, HIP 41378 hosts five confirmed transiting planets with periods ranging from 15 to over 542 days, providing a unique dynamical laboratory for investigating wide multi-planet systems analogous to the Solar System. In this study, we present an intensive space-based photometric follow-up of HIP 41378, combining 15 new CHEOPS observations with eight TESS sectors, alongside data from K2, Spitzer, HST, and HARPS. We dynamically modeled the TTVs and RV signals of the two inner sub-Neptunes via N-body integration. These planets, HIP 41378 b ($P_{b}$ = 15.57 days) and HIP 41378 c ($P_{c}$ = 31.71 days), are close to ($\Delta\sim1.8$ %) a 2:1 period commensurability. We report a clear detection of TTVs with amplitudes of 20 mins for planet b and greater than 3 hrs for planet c. We dynamically confirm the planetary nature of HIP 41378 g, a non-transiting planet with a period of about 64 days and a mass of about 7 $M_{\oplus}$, close to a 2:1 commensurability with planet c, suggesting a possible MMR chain in the inner system. Our precise determination of the masses, eccentricities, and radii of HIP 41378 b and c enabled us to investigate their possible volatile-rich compositions. Finally, by leveraging on the last TESS sectors we constrained the period of HIP 41378 d to three possible aliases ($P_{d} =$ 278, 371, and 1113 days) suggesting that the system could be placed in a double quasi resonant chain, highlighting its complex dynamical architecture.

TESLA-X: An effective method to search for sub-threshold lensed gravitational waves with a targeted population model

Strong gravitational lensing can produce copies of gravitational-wave signals from the same source with the same waveform morphologies but different amplitudes and arrival times. Some of these strongly-lensed gravitational-wave signals can be demagnified and become subthreshold. We present TESLA-X, an enhanced approach to the original GstLAL-based TargetEd Subthreshold Lensing seArch (TESLA) method, for improving the detection efficiency of these potential subthreshold lensed signals. TESLA-X utilizes lensed injections to generate a targeted population model and a targeted template bank. We compare the performance of a full template bank search, TESLA, and TESLA-X methods via a simulation campaign, and demonstrate the performance of TESLA-X in recovering lensed injections, particularly targeting a mock event. Our results show that the TESLA-X method achieves a maximum of $\sim 10\%$ higher search sensitivity compared to the TESLA method within the subthreshold regime, presenting a step towards detecting the first lensed gravitational wave. TESLA-X will be employed for the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's collaboration-wide analysis to search for lensing signatures in the fourth observing run.

Fifth force and equivalence principle tests search for new interactions by precisely measuring forces between macroscopic collections of atoms and molecules and their properties under free fall. In contrast, the early Universe plasma probes these interactions at a more fundamental level. In this paper, we consider the case of a scalar mediating a fifth force, and show that the effects of dimensional transmutation, spontaneous symmetry breaking, and the running of the gauge couplings cause the scalar's low-energy interactions to mix, leading to nearly universal dynamics at early times. We use known expressions for the pressure of the Standard Model during its various epochs to compute the scalar effective potential, and find that the cosmological dynamics of this scalar are very sensitive to the reheat temperature of the Universe. Given the unknown reheat temperature, we show that scalar couplings to matter larger than $\sim 10^{-6}(m_\phi/{\rm eV})^{-1/4}$ relative to gravity produce the correct dark matter abundance, motivating new physics searches in this part of parameter space.

In this Letter, we motivate the fact that couplings between a scalar field and the Standard Model with strengths $10^{-6}(m_\phi/{\rm eV})^{-1/4}$ relative to gravity yield the total measured cosmological dark matter abundance over a broad mass range of $10^{-12}$ to $10^{14}\ \rm{eV}$. Remarkably, this result holds with minimal sensitivity to whether the scalar couples to electrons, photons, hadrons, or other particles at laboratory energy scales, thereby linking fifth force experiments to the search for dark matter.

The gauge-singlet right-handed neutrinos would be essential to explain the tiny masses of active neutrinos. We consider the effective field theory of the Standard Model extended with these fields under the assumption that neutrinos are Dirac particles. In this framework, we provide a comprehensive study for the phenomenological consequences of various dimension six interactions employing various high and low energy observables. These include the neutrino mass itself, constraints from electroweak precision test and collider searches for lepton or jet plus missing energy, coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering, beta decays, as well as decays of proton, meson, tau, and top. We also study their astrophysical and cosmological implications for stellar cooling and relativistic degrees of freedom.

We show that Earth's natural environment can serve as a powerful probe for ultralight axion dark matter. In the presence of global geomagnetic fields, the axions with masses ranging from $10^{-15}\,{\rm eV}-10^{-13}\,{\rm eV}$ induce electromagnetic waves in the (sub-) extremely low-frequency band ($0.3-30\,{\rm Hz}$) through the axion-photon coupling. We predict the amplitude of induced magnetic fields in the Earth-ionosphere cavity, taking the finite conductivity of the atmosphere into account. This allows us to constrain the axion-photon coupling parameter, $g_{\rm a\gamma}$, from the long-term monitoring data of the low-frequency magnetic fields, resulting in a significant improvement from the previous constraints down to $g_{\rm a\gamma} \lesssim 4\times10^{-13}\,{\rm GeV}^{-1}$ for axion mass $\sim 3 \times 10^{-14}\,{\rm eV}$.

The possibility of extracting energy from a rotating black hole via the Blandford-Znajek mechanism represents a cornerstone of relativistic astrophysics. We present general-relativistic collisionless kinetic simulations of Kerr black-hole magnetospheres covering a wide range in the black-hole spin. Considering a classical split-monopole magnetic field, we can reproduce with these ab-initio calculations the force-free electrodynamics of rotating black holes and measure the power of the jet launched as a function of the spin. The Blandford-Znajek luminosity we find is in very good agreement with analytic calculations and compatible with general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations via a simple rescaling. These results provide strong evidence of the robustness of the Blandford-Znajek mechanism and accurate estimates of the electromagnetic luminosity to be expected in those scenarios involving rotating black holes across the mass scale.

The population study of stellar-mass black hole (sBH) binaries with ground-based gravitational wave detection has achieved tremendous success in recent years. Future observation of extreme mass-ratio inspirals will similarly require proper population analysis that identify the formation channels, measuring the branch ratio(s) and characterizing major properties within each major channel. In this work, we propose that the measurement of eccentricity, inclination, and component mass provides critical information to distinguish different formation channels and probe detailed formation mechanisms. Focusing on the dry and wet extreme mass-ratio inspirals, we establish the theoretical expectation of these observables in each formation channel. We also discuss how their distributions can be used to probe lifetime and turbulence level of active galactic nuclei disks, accretion patterns of supermassive black holes and population properties of sBHs within nuclear star clusters.
