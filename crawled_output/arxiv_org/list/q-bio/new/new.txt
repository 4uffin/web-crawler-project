Title:
Biomarkers of brain diseases
Pascal Helson, Arvind Kumar
Subjects:
Neurons and Cognition (q-bio.NC); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Machine Learning (cs.LG)
Despite the diversity of brain data acquired and advanced AI-based algorithms to analyze them, brain features are rarely used in clinics for diagnosis and prognosis. Here we argue that the field continues to rely on cohort comparisons to seek biomarkers, despite the well-established degeneracy of brain features. Using a thought experiment, we show that more data and more powerful algorithms will not be sufficient to identify biomarkers of brain diseases. We argue that instead of comparing patient versus healthy controls using single data type, we should use multimodal (e.g. brain activity, neurotransmitters, neuromodulators, brain imaging) and longitudinal brain data to guide the grouping before defining multidimensional biomarkers for brain diseases.

Title:
How Easterners and Westerners perceive ADHD differently

Neurons and Cognition (q-bio.NC)
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder has traditionally been conceptualized as a neurodevelopmental condition associated with deficits such as inattention, impulsivity, and poor time management. Such perspectives often emphasize pathology and functional limitations. More recent scholarship, however, has begun to reconceptualize ADHD by identifying potential adaptive characteristics, including heightened energy, periods of hyperfocus, and advanced cognitive flexibility. A growing body of qualitative research also examines self reported experiences of high functioning individuals with ADHD, highlighting positive traits and successful coping strategies. Despite these developments, the majority of existing studies remain concentrated in Western contexts, particularly the United Kingdom, Netherlands, and Canada. This review seeks to address this imbalance by analyzing literature on ADHD strengths in Europe and North America alongside emerging studies from Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Singapore.

Pain remains one of the most pressing health challenges, yet its measurement still relies heavily on self-report, limiting monitoring in non-communicative patients and hindering translational research. Neural oscillations recorded with electroencephalography (EEG) provide a promising avenue for identifying reproducible markers of nociceptive processing. Prior studies have reported pain-related event-related desynchronization (ERD) in the alpha and beta bands, but most rely on trial-averaging, obscuring variability that may be critical for perception. We analyzed high-density EEG from 59 healthy participants who underwent electrical stimulation under Pain and No-Pain conditions. Per-trial time-frequency decomposition revealed robust beta-band ERD in frontal-central electrodes that differentiated Pain from No-Pain trials. Generalized linear mixed models demonstrated that ERD scaled with subjective intensity ratings (VAS), and that age and gender moderated this relationship. Reverse models further showed that ERD predicted VAS ratings across participants, underscoring its potential as a nonverbal marker of pain. These findings provide preliminary evidence that trial-level EEG oscillations can serve as reliable indicators of pain and open avenues for individualized, report-free pain monitoring. Future work should validate these results in patient populations and extend analyses to multimodal approaches combining EEG, MRI, and attention-based modulation strategies.

MAE-SAM2: Mask Autoencoder-Enhanced SAM2 for Clinical Retinal Vascular Leakage Segmentation
Xin Xing, Irmak Karaca, Samira Badrloo, Quan Dong Nguyen, Mahadevan Subramaniam
Subjects:
Tissues and Organs (q-bio.TO); Image and Video Processing (eess.IV)
We propose MAE-SAM2, a novel foundation model for retinal vascular leakage segmentation on fluorescein angiography images. Due to the small size and dense distribution of the leakage areas, along with the limited availability of labeled clinical data, this presents a significant challenge for segmentation tasks. Our approach integrates a Self-Supervised learning (SSL) strategy, Masked Autoencoder (MAE), with SAM2. In our implementation, we explore different loss functions and conclude a task-specific combined loss. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that MAE-SAM2 outperforms several state-of-the-art models, achieving the highest Dice score and Intersection-over-Union (IoU). Compared to the original SAM2, our model achieves a $5\%$ performance improvement, highlighting the promise of foundation models with self-supervised pretraining in clinical imaging tasks.

As a lightweight and non-invasive imaging technique, lung ultrasound (LUS) has gained importance for assessing lung pathologies. The use of Artificial intelligence (AI) in medical decision support systems is promising due to the time- and expertise-intensive interpretation, however, due to the poor quality of existing data used for training AI models, their usability for real-world applications remains unclear. In a prospective study, we analyze data from 63 COVID-19 suspects (33 positive) collected at Maastricht University Medical Centre. Ultrasound recordings at six body locations were acquired following the BLUE protocol and manually labeled for severity of lung involvement. Several AI models were applied and trained for detection and severity of pulmonary infection. The severity of the lung infection, as assigned by human annotators based on the LUS videos, is not significantly different between COVID-19 positive and negative patients (p = 0.89). Nevertheless, the predictions of image-based AI models identify a COVID-19 infection with 65% accuracy when applied zero-shot (i.e., trained on other datasets), and up to 79% with targeted training, whereas the accuracy based on human annotations is at most 65%. Multi-modal models combining images and CBC improve significantly over image-only models. Although our analysis generally supports the value of AI in LUS assessment, the evaluated models fall short of the performance expected from previous work. We find this is due to 1) the heterogeneity of LUS datasets, limiting the generalization ability to new data, 2) the frame-based processing of AI models ignoring video-level information, and 3) lack of work on multi-modal models that can extract the most relevant information from video-, image- and variable-based inputs. To aid future research, we publish the dataset at: this https URL.

Title:
HiLWS: A Human-in-the-Loop Weak Supervision Framework for Curating Clinical and Home Video Data for Neurological Assessment

Video-based assessment of motor symptoms in conditions such as Parkinson's disease (PD) offers a scalable alternative to in-clinic evaluations, but home-recorded videos introduce significant challenges, including visual degradation, inconsistent task execution, annotation noise, and domain shifts. We present HiLWS, a cascaded human-in-the-loop weak supervision framework for curating and annotating hand motor task videos from both clinical and home settings. Unlike conventional single-stage weak supervision methods, HiLWS employs a novel cascaded approach, first applies weak supervision to aggregate expert-provided annotations into probabilistic labels, which are then used to train machine learning models. Model predictions, combined with expert input, are subsequently refined through a second stage of weak supervision. The complete pipeline includes quality filtering, optimized pose estimation, and task-specific segment extraction, complemented by context-sensitive evaluation metrics that assess both visual fidelity and clinical relevance by prioritizing ambiguous cases for expert review. Our findings reveal key failure modes in home recorded data and emphasize the importance of context-sensitive curation strategies for robust medical video analysis.

Genomics (q-bio.GN); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)
The gene set analysis (GSA) is a foundational approach for uncovering the molecular functions associated with a group of genes. Recently, LLM-powered methods have emerged to annotate gene sets with biological functions together with coherent explanatory insights. However, existing studies primarily focus on proprietary models, which have been shown to outperform their open-source counterparts despite concerns over cost and data privacy. Furthermore, no research has investigated the application of advanced reasoning strategies to the GSA task. To address this gap, we introduce Gene-R1, a data-augmented learning framework that equips lightweight and open-source LLMs with step-by-step reasoning capabilities tailored to GSA. Experiments on 1,508 in-distribution gene sets demonstrate that Gene-R1 achieves substantial performance gains, matching commercial LLMs. On 106 out-of-distribution gene sets, Gene-R1 performs comparably to both commercial and large-scale LLMs, exhibiting robust generalizability across diverse gene sources.

Effective analysis in neuroscience benefits significantly from robust conceptual frameworks. Traditional metrics of interbrain synchrony in social neuroscience typically depend on fixed, correlation-based approaches, restricting their explanatory capacity to descriptive observations. Inspired by the successful integration of geometric insights in network science, we propose leveraging discrete geometry to examine the dynamic reconfigurations in neural interactions during social exchanges. Unlike conventional synchrony approaches, our method interprets inter-brain connectivity changes through the evolving geometric structures of neural networks. This geometric framework is realized through a pipeline that identifies critical transitions in network connectivity using entropy metrics derived from curvature distributions. By doing so, we significantly enhance the capacity of hyperscanning methodologies to uncover underlying neural mechanisms in interactive social behavior.

Temperature and Competition: Drivers in the Ecological Dynamics of Aedes Mosquitoes and Dengue Spread

Subjects:
Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE)
Dengue, a mosquito-borne viral disease common in tropical areas, is spread by Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. Temperature changes driven by climate affect vector ecology and expand regions of species coexistence. The combined effect of temperature and larval competition on mosquito dynamics and dengue transmission is unclear. We built a deterministic model with temperature-dependent parameters to study larval-stage interactions, linked with a SEIR framework for human infection. We assessed invasion potential, coexistence, and infection peaks. The basic reproduction number (R0) was calculated using the Next Generation Matrix, and the effective reproduction number (Rt) came from simulations with larval competition. Aedes albopictus invades aegypti-dominated systems when the aegypti competition coefficient is below 0.47, with neutral equilibrium from 0.47 to 0.60 and exclusion above 0.60 in stable conditions. In temperature-dependent settings, invasion extends to a coefficient of 0.75. Coexistence analysis showed aegypti dominance (~87% abundance) in stable settings, while temperature-dependent conditions led to ~50% abundance for both species. Dengue cases peaked at 156-168 in stable conditions and 195-220 in temperature-dependent ones. Stronger albopictus competition lowered peaks in both cases. Temperature boosts albopictus invasion and coexistence, while aegypti drives higher infection peaks. Balanced species abundances raise transmission risks, emphasizing the need to factor temperature and competition into vector control.

Title:
Evolutionary dynamics of memory-based strategies in repeated and structured social interactions
Ketian Sun, Qi Su, Long Wang
Subjects:
Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE)
Human social life is shaped by repeated interactions, where past experiences guide future behavior. In evolutionary game theory, a key challenge is to identify strategies that harness such memory to succeed in repeated encounters. Decades of research have identified influential one-step memory strategies (such as Tit-for-Tat, Generous Tit-for-Tat, and Win-Stay Lose-Shift) that promote cooperation in iterated pairwise games. However, these strategies occupy only a small corner of the vast strategy space, and performance in isolated pairwise contests does not guarantee evolutionary success. The most effective strategies are those that can spread through a population and stabilize cooperation. We propose a general framework for repeated-interaction strategies that encompasses arbitrary memory lengths, diverse informational inputs (including both one's own and the opponent's past actions), and deterministic or stochastic decision rules. We analyze their evolutionary dynamics and derive general mathematical results for the emergence of cooperation in any network structure. We then introduce a unifying indicator that quantifies the contribution of repeated-interaction strategies to population-level cooperation. Applying this indicator, we show that long-memory strategies evolve to promote cooperation more effectively than short-memory strategies, challenging the traditional view that extended memory offers no advantage. This work expands the study of repeated interactions beyond one-step memory strategies to the full spectrum of memory capacities. It provides a plausible explanation for the high levels of cooperation observed in human societies, which traditional one-step memory models cannot account for.

Causal Emergence of Consciousness through Learned Multiscale Neural Dynamics in Mice
Zhipeng Wang, Yingqi Rong, Kaiwei Liu, Mingzhe Yang, Jiang Zhang, Jing He
Subjects:
Neurons and Cognition (q-bio.NC)
Consciousness spans macroscopic experience and microscopic neuronal activity, yet linking these scales remains challenging. Prevailing theories, such as Integrated Information Theory, focus on a single scale, overlooking how causal power and its dynamics unfold across scales. Progress is constrained by scarce cross-scale data and difficulties in quantifying multiscale causality and dynamics. Here, we present a machine learning framework that infers multiscale causal variables and their dynamics from near-cellular-resolution calcium imaging in the mouse dorsal cortex. At lower levels, variables primarily aggregate input-driven information, whereas at higher levels they realize causality through metastable or saddle-point dynamics during wakefulness, collapsing into localized, stochastic dynamics under anesthesia. A one-dimensional top-level conscious variable captures the majority of causal power, yet variables across other scales also contribute substantially, giving rise to high emergent complexity in the conscious state. Together, these findings provide a multiscale causal framework that links neural activity to conscious states.

Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE); Computation (stat.CO)
A central question in evolutionary biology is how to quantitatively understand the dynamics of genetically diverse populations. Modeling the genotype distribution is challenging, as it ultimately requires tracking all correlations (or cumulants) among alleles at different loci. The quasi-linkage equilibrium (QLE) approximation simplifies this by assuming that correlations between alleles at different loci are weak -- i.e., low linkage disequilibrium -- allowing their dynamics to be modeled perturbatively. However, QLE breaks down under strong selection, significant epistatic interactions, or weak recombination. We extend the multilocus QLE framework to allow cumulants up to order $K$ to evolve dynamically, while higher-order cumulants ($>K$) are assumed to equilibrate rapidly. This extended QLE (exQLE) framework yields a general equation of motion for cumulants up to order $K$, which parallels the standard QLE dynamics (recovered when $K = 1$). In this formulation, cumulant dynamics are driven by the gradient of average fitness, mediated by a geometrically interpretable matrix that stems from competition among genotypes. Our analysis shows that the exQLE with $K=2$ accurately captures cumulant dynamics even when the fitness function includes higher-order (e.g., third-- or fourth--order) epistatic interactions, capabilities that standard QLE lacks. We also applied the exQLE framework to infer fitness parameters from temporal sequence data. Overall, exQLE provides a systematic and interpretable approximation scheme, leveraging analytical cumulant dynamics and reducing complexity by progressively truncating higher-order cumulants.

Quantitative Methods (q-bio.QM)
Complex patterns emerge across a wide range of biological systems. While such patterns often exhibit remarkable robustness, variation and irregularity exist at multiple scales and can carry important information about the underlying agent interactions driving collective dynamics. Many methods for quantifying biological patterns focus on large-scale, characteristic features (such as stripe width or spot number), but questions remain on how to characterize messy patterns. In the case of cellular patterns that emerge during development or regeneration, understanding where patterns are most susceptible to variability may help shed light on cell behavior and the tissue environment. Motivated by these challenges, we introduce methods based on topological data analysis to classify and quantify messy patterns arising from agent-based interactions, by extracting meaningful biological interpretations from persistence barcode summaries. To compute persistent homology, our methods rely on a sweeping-plane filtration which, in comparison to the Vietoris--Rips filtration, is more rarely applied to biological systems. We demonstrate how results from the sweeping-plane filtration can be interpreted to quantify stripe patterns (with and without interruptions) by analyzing in silico zebrafish skin patterns, and we generate new quantitative predictions about which pattern features may be most robust or variable. Our work provides an automated framework for quantifying features and irregularities in spot and stripe patterns and highlights how different approaches to persistent homology can provide complementary insight into biological systems.

Bistability and Noise-Induced Evasion in Tumor-Immune Dynamics with Antigen Accumulation and Immune Escape
Mengfan Tan, Shaoqing Chen, Chunjin Wei, Da Zhou
Comments:
24 pages, 14 figures
Subjects:
Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE)
Tumor-immune interactions are shaped by both antigenic heterogeneity and stochastic perturbations in the tumor microenvironment, yet the mathematical mechanisms underlying immune phase transitions remain poorly understood. We propose a four-compartment dynamical model that incorporates antigen accumulation and immune escape mutations. Bifurcation analysis reveals bistability between immune surveillance and immune escape states, providing a mechanistic explanation for heterogeneous immune outcomes during tumor progression. In the multistable regime, the stable manifold of a saddle point partitions the state space into distinct basins of attraction, determining the long-term fate of the system. We further analyze how stochastic fluctuations in the tumor microenvironment perturb these separatrices, potentially triggering irreversible state transitions. By characterizing the critical noise intensity and estimating the tipping time, we establish a mathematical framework for assessing noise-induced transitions. The model further predicts that increasing tumor cell death can improve system resilience to stochastic perturbations, whereas stronger immune pressure may facilitate immune escape-highlighting the nonlinear and non-monotonic nature of tumor-immune dynamics.

Strombom D, Futterman C. An Alignment-Free Explanation for Collective Predator Evasion in Moving Animal Groups. Dynamics. 2023; 3(4):793-802
Subjects:
Quantitative Methods (q-bio.QM)
Moving animal groups consist of many distinct individuals but can operate and function as one unit when performing different tasks. Effectively evading unexpected predator attacks is one primary task for many moving groups. The current explanation for predator evasion responses in moving animal groups require the individuals in the groups interact via (velocity) alignment. However, experiments have shown that some animals do not use alignment. This suggests that another explanation for the predator evasion capacity in at least these species is needed. Here we establish that effective collective predator evasion does not require alignment, it can be induced via attraction and repulsion alone. We also show that speed differences between individuals that have directly observed the predator and those that have not influence evasion success and the speed of the collective evasion process, but are not required to induce the phenomenon. Our work here adds collective predator evasion to a number of phenomena previously thought to require alignment interactions that have recently been shown to emerge from attraction and repulsion alone. Based on our findings we suggest experiments and make predictions that may lead to a deeper understanding of not only collective predator evasion, but also collective motion in general.

Learning to Equalize: Data-Driven Frequency-Domain Signal Recovery in Molecular Communications
Cheng Xiang, Yu Huang, Miaowen Wen, Weiqiang Tan, Chan-Byoung Chae
Subjects:
Subcellular Processes (q-bio.SC); Information Theory (cs.IT)
In molecular communications (MC), inter-symbol interference (ISI) and noise are key factors that degrade communication reliability. Although time-domain equalization can effectively mitigate these effects, it often entails high computational complexity concerning the channel memory. In contrast, frequency-domain equalization (FDE) offers greater computational efficiency but typically requires prior knowledge of the channel model. To address this limitation, this letter proposes FDE techniques based on long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks, enabling temporal correlation modeling in MC channels to improve ISI and noise suppression. To eliminate the reliance on prior channel information in conventional FDE methods, a supervised training strategy is employed for channel-adaptive equalization. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed LSTM-FDE significantly reduces the bit error rate compared to traditional FDE and feedforward neural network-based equalizers. This performance gain is attributed to the LSTM's temporal modeling capabilities, which enhance noise suppression and accelerate model convergence, while maintaining comparable computational efficiency.

This article presents a novel microscopy image analysis framework designed for low-budget labs equipped with a standard CPU desktop. The Python-based program enables cytometric analysis of live, unstained cells in culture through an advanced computer vision and machine learning pipeline. Crucially, the framework operates on label-free data, requiring no manually annotated training data or training phase. It is accessible via a user-friendly, cross-platform GUI that requires no programming skills, while also providing a scripting interface for programmatic control and integration by developers. The end-to-end workflow performs semantic and instance segmentation, feature extraction, analysis, evaluation, and automated report generation. Its modular architecture supports easy maintenance and flexible integration while supporting both single-image and batch processing. Validated on several unstained cell types from the public dataset of livecells, the framework demonstrates superior accuracy and reproducibility compared to contemporary tools like Cellpose and StarDist. Its competitive segmentation speed on a CPU-based platform highlights its significant potential for basic research and clinical applications -- particularly in cell transplantation for personalized medicine and muscle regeneration therapies.

Other Quantitative Biology (q-bio.OT)
PF708 teriparatide, manufactured by Alvogen, was approved through the 505(B)(2) application after the expiration of Forteo market exclusivity in October 2019. The 505(B)(2) application allows safety and efficacy information to come from studies not conducted by the applicant if it is demonstrated that the proposed product shares characteristics (active ingredient, dose, route of administration, strength) with the reference product and comparable pharmacokinetic data is established. Real-world data is thus needed to demonstrate equivalent safety and efficacy between Forteo and PF708 teriparatide. The purpose of this study was to evaluate changes in bone mineral density in osteoporotic patients treated with either Forteo or PF708 teriparatide for 18-24 months. This retrospective chart review included osteoporotic patients > 18 years of age who received PF708 teriparatide or Forteo prescriptions from the practice location and initiated therapy between October 1, 2019 and October 31, 2022. The primary endpoint was percent change from baseline in BMD of the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and total hip. A total of 108 patients were included: 27 (median age 67 years, 88.9% female) in the PF708 teriparatide group and 81 (median age 68 years, 85.2% female) in the Forteo group. There was no significant difference in median change from baseline BMD of lumbar spine (+9.6% vs +7.7%, P= 0.56), left femoral neck (1.5% vs 2.8%, P= 0.39), right femoral neck (+1.6% vs +4.4%, P= 0.14), left total hip (+2.4% vs +3.2%, P= 0.24), or right total hip (0.0% vs +1.4% , P= 0.71) with PF708 teriparatide vs Forteo, respectively. In this small retrospective study, effect on BMD and reported adverse events were similar between PF708 teriparatide and Forteo when used for the recommended duration of therapy.

Residual Gaze Behavior During Navigation in Blindness and Low Vision

Subjects:
Neurons and Cognition (q-bio.NC)
Background: Outdoor navigation poses significant challenges for people with blindness or low vision, yet the role of gaze behavior in supporting mobility remains underexplored. Fully sighted individuals typically adopt consistent scanning strategies, whereas those with visual impairments rely on heterogeneous adaptations shaped by residual vision and experience.
Methods: We conducted a comparative eye-tracking study of fully sighted, low vision, blind, and fully blind participants navigating outdoor routes. Using a wearable eye tracker, we quantified fixation counts, fixation rate, fixation area, direction, peak fixation location, and walking speed.
Results: Walking speed declined systematically with worsening vision. Fixation count increased with greater impairment, reflecting slower travel times and more frequent sampling. Fixation rate rose with worsening vision, though between-group differences were generally not significant between most groups. Fixation spatial coverage decreased along the continuum of vision loss. Fixation patterns were most consistent in the fully sighted group. Peak fixation locations were centered in fully sighted participants but shifted outward and became more variable with impairment.
Conclusion: Gaze strategies during navigation form a graded continuum across vision groups, with fully sighted and fully blind participants at opposite poles and low vision and blind groups spanning the middle. Visual acuity alone does not predict functional gaze use, as rehabilitation experience and adaptive strategies strongly shape behavior. These findings highlight the need for personalized rehabilitation and assistive technologies, with residual gaze patterns offering insight into mobility capacity and training opportunities for safer navigation.

Representational drift under spontaneous activity - self-organized criticality enhances representational reliability
Zhuda Yang, Junhao Liang, Wing Ho Yung, Changsong Zhou
Subjects:
Neurons and Cognition (q-bio.NC)
Neural systems face the challenge of maintaining reliable representations amid variations from plasticity and spontaneous activity. In particular, the spontaneous dynamics in neuronal circuit is known to operate near a highly variable critical state, which intuitively contrasts with the requirement of reliable representation. It is intriguing to understand how reliable representation could be maintained or even enhanced by critical spontaneous states. We firstly examined the co-existence of the scale-free avalanche in the spontaneous activity of mouse visual cortex with restricted representational geometry manifesting representational reliability amid the representational drift with respect to the visual stimulus. To explore how critical spontaneous state influences the neural representation, we built an excitation-inhibition network with homeostatic plasticity, which self-organizes to the critical spontaneous state. This model successfully reproduced both representational drift and restricted representational geometry observed experimentally, in contrast with randomly shuffled plasticity which causes accumulated drift of representational geometry. We further showed that the self-organized critical state enhances the cross-session low-dimensional representation, comparing to the non-critical state, by restricting the synapse weight into a low variation space. Our findings suggest that spontaneous self-organized criticality serves not only as a ubiquitous property of neural systems but also as a functional mechanism for maintaining reliable information representation under continuously changing networks, providing a potential explanation how the brain maintains consistent perception and behavior despite ongoing synaptic rewiring.

Epidemic control frequently relies on adjusting interventions based on prevalence. But designing such policies is a highly non-trivial problem due to uncertain intervention effects, costs and the difficulty of quantifying key transmission mechanisms and parameters. Here, using exact mathematical and computational methods, we reveal a fundamental limit in epidemic control in that prevalence feedback policies are outperformed by a single optimally chosen constant control level. Specifically, we find no incentive to use prevalence based control under a wide class of cost functions that depend arbitrarily on interventions and scale with infections. We also identify regimes where prevalence feedback is beneficial. Our results challenge the current understanding that prevalence based interventions are required for epidemic control and suggest that, for many classes of epidemics, interventions should not be varied unless the epidemic is near the herd immunity threshold.

TRPM4 is overexpressed in prostate cancer (PCa) associated with metastasis or recurrence. There is paucity of information pertaining to TRPM4 characterization and functions at single-cell level in PCa. In this study, generalized additive model (GAM) was utilized to model the relationship between TRPM4 and genes shortlisted using Spearman-Kendall dual-filter in aggressive PCa and benign prostate (BP) control cells derived from scRNA-seq dataset. Seven ribosomal genes (RPL10, RPL27, RPL28, RPS2, RPS8, RPS12, and RPS26; averaged into Ribo as the gene set), passed the dual-filter specifically in PCa cells. GAM modeling of TRPM4-Ribo significantly outperformed TRPM4 modeling with alternative cancer gene sets (GSK-3B, mTOR, NF-KB, PI3K/AKT, and Wnt). Cell explanatory power (CEP) classification was devised and verified by cross-validation to identify individual PCa cells most well-predicted by the model. CEP classification binarized PCa cells into top-ranked explanatory power (TREP; more well-predicted by the model) and non-TREP cells. In TRPM4-Ribo GAM plots, distribution pattern of TREP cells shifted at an inflection point (IP) i.e., the specific TRPM4 expression value that further binarized the plot into pre-IP (TRPM4 values below IP) and post-IP (TRPM4 values above IP) regions, producing a quadrant of TREP versus non-TREP cells for each PCa patient. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis showed that pre-IP TREP cells enriched for immune-related GOs, while post-IP TREP cells enriched for ribosomal, translation, and cell adhesion GOs. In conclusion, the CEP-IP framework based on pairwise genes produces quadrants of cancer cell subpopulations, enabling the identification of distinctive biology with potential therapeutic implications.

Title:
A Mathematical Model of Wound Healing: Effects of Local and Systemic Factors
Alinafe Maenje, Joseph Malinzi
Subjects:
Other Quantitative Biology (q-bio.OT)
This study presents a mathematical model formulated as a system of first-order non-linear ordinary differential equations, aimed at examining the effects of different factors, classified as local and systemic factors on a wound healing process. Specifically, the model incorporates pathogens, inflammatory cells, fibroblast cells, collagen, and the initial wound size. The variables utilized in the model lack specific units since they represent combined responses of different cell types. As such, these variables serve as indicators of the relative behaviors of these cellular populations. The feasibility of the model solution is examined through the demonstration of its positivity. A threshold, denoted $R_w$, is established to determine the conditions necessary for the existence of a wound-free equilibrium. Sensitivity analysis is carried out to determine the contribution of parameters to the behavior of fibroblast cells and $R_w$, which are crucial to the wound healing process. Through numerical simulations, it is demonstrated that factors such as oxygen levels, pathogen activity, inflammatory cell activity, age, smoking, alcoholism, and stress exert considerable influence on the behaviors of these cells, thereby contributing to delayed wound healing and the occurrence of chronic wounds.

Neural networks for learning macroscopic chemotactic sensitivity from microscopic models
Radek Erban
Subjects:
Quantitative Methods (q-bio.QM); Biological Physics (physics.bio-ph)
The macroscopic (population-level) dynamics of chemotactic cell movement -- arising from underlying microscopic (individual-based) models -- are often described by parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) governing the spatio-temporal evolution of cell concentrations. In certain cases, these macroscopic PDEs can be analytically derived from microscopic models, thereby elucidating the dependence of PDE coefficients on the parameters of the underlying individual-based dynamics. However, such analytical derivations are not always feasible, particularly for more complex or nonlinear microscopic models. In these instances, neural networks offer a promising alternative for estimating the coefficients of macroscopic PDEs directly from data generated by microscopic simulations. In this work, three microscopic models of chemotaxis are investigated. The macroscopic chemotaxis sensitivity is estimated using neural networks, thereby bridging the gap between individual-level behaviours and population-level descriptions. The results are compared with macroscopic PDEs, which can be derived for each model in certain parameter regimes.

MIDOG 2025 Track 2 submission
Subjects:
Image and Video Processing (eess.IV); Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV); Quantitative Methods (q-bio.QM)
Motivation: Accurate classification of mitotic figures into normal and atypical types is crucial for tumor prognostication in digital pathology. However, developing robust deep learning models for this task is challenging due to the subtle morphological differences, as well as significant class and hardness imbalances in real-world histopathology datasets. Methods: We propose a novel deep learning approach based on a ResNet backbone with specialized classification heads. Our architecture uniquely models both the mitotic figure phenotype and the instance difficulty simultaneously. This method is specifically designed to handle the challenges of diverse tissue types, scanner variability, and imbalanced data. We employed focal loss to effectively mitigate the pronounced class imbalance, and a comprehensive data augmentation pipeline was implemented to enhance the model's robustness and generalizability. Results: Our approach demonstrated strong and consistent performance. In a 5-fold cross-validation on the MIDOG 2025 Track 2 dataset, it achieved a mean balanced accuracy of 0.8744 +/- 0.0093 and an ROC AUC of 0.9505 +/- 0.029. The model showed robust generalization across preliminary leaderboard evaluations, achieving an overall balanced accuracy of 0.8736 +/- 0.0204. Conclusion: The proposed method offers a reliable and generalizable solution for the classification of atypical and normal mitotic figures. By addressing the inherent challenges of real world data, our approach has the potential to support precise prognostic assessments in clinical practice and improve consistency in pathological diagnosis.

ZapGPT: Free-form Language Prompting for Simulated Cellular Control

Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Multiagent Systems (cs.MA); Cell Behavior (q-bio.CB)
Human language is one of the most expressive tools for conveying intent, yet most artificial or biological systems lack mechanisms to interpret or respond meaningfully to it. Bridging this gap could enable more natural forms of control over complex, decentralized systems. In AI and artificial life, recent work explores how language can specify high-level goals, but most systems still depend on engineered rewards, task-specific supervision, or rigid command sets, limiting generalization to novel instructions. Similar constraints apply in synthetic biology and bioengineering, where the locus of control is often genomic rather than environmental perturbation.
A key open question is whether artificial or biological collectives can be guided by free-form natural language alone, without task-specific tuning or carefully designed evaluation metrics. We provide one possible answer here by showing, for the first time, that simple agents' collective behavior can be guided by free-form language prompts: one AI model transforms an imperative prompt into an intervention that is applied to simulated cells; a second AI model scores how well the prompt describes the resulting cellular dynamics; and the former AI model is evolved to improve the scores generated by the latter.
Unlike previous work, our method does not require engineered fitness functions or domain-specific prompt design. We show that the evolved system generalizes to unseen prompts without retraining. By treating natural language as a control layer, the system suggests a future in which spoken or written prompts could direct computational, robotic, or biological systems to desired behaviors. This work provides a concrete step toward this vision of AI-biology partnerships, in which language replaces mathematical objective functions, fixed rules, and domain-specific programming.

Strategies to improve the predicting performance of Message-Passing Neural-Networks for molecular property predictions can be achieved by simplifying how the message is passed and by using descriptors that capture multiple aspects of molecular graphs. In this work, we designed model architectures that achieved state-of-the-art performance, surpassing more complex models such as those pre-trained on external databases. We assessed dataset diversity to complement our performance results, finding that structural diversity influences the need for additional components in our MPNNs and feature sets.
In most datasets, our best architecture employs bidirectional message-passing with an attention mechanism, applied to a minimalist message formulation that excludes self-perception, highlighting that relatively simpler models, compared to classical MPNNs, yield higher class separability. In contrast, we found that convolution normalization factors do not benefit the predictive power in all the datasets tested. This was corroborated in both global and node-level outputs. Additionally, we analyzed the influence of both adding spatial features and working with 3D graphs, finding that 2D molecular graphs are sufficient when complemented with appropriately chosen 3D descriptors. This approach not only preserves predictive performance but also reduces computational cost by over 50%, making it particularly advantageous for high-throughput screening campaigns.

Geometric Phase of Stochastic Oscillators

Several definitions of phase have been proposed for stochastic oscillators, among which the mean-return-time phase and the stochastic asymptotic phase have drawn particular attention. Quantitative comparisons between these two definitions have been done in previous studies, but physical interpretations of such a relation are still missing. In this work, we illustrate this relation using the geometric phase, which is an essential concept in both classical and quantum mechanics. We use properties of probability currents and the generalized Doob's h-transform to explain how the geometric phase arises in stochastic oscillators. Such an analogy is also reminiscent of the noise-induced phase shift in oscillatory systems with deterministic perturbation, allowing us to compare the phase responses in deterministic and stochastic oscillators. The resulting framework unifies these distinct phase definitions and reveals that their difference is governed by a geometric drift term analogous to curvature. This interpretation bridges spectral theory, stochastic dynamics, and geometric phase, and provides new insight into how noise reshapes oscillatory behavior. Our results suggest broader applications of geometric-phase concepts to coupled stochastic oscillators and neural models.

FragmentGPT: A Unified GPT Model for Fragment Growing, Linking, and Merging in Molecular Design

Subjects:
Machine Learning (cs.LG); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Biomolecules (q-bio.BM)
Fragment-Based Drug Discovery (FBDD) is a popular approach in early drug development, but designing effective linkers to combine disconnected molecular fragments into chemically and pharmacologically viable candidates remains challenging. Further complexity arises when fragments contain structural redundancies, like duplicate rings, which cannot be addressed by simply adding or removing atoms or bonds. To address these challenges in a unified framework, we introduce FragmentGPT, which integrates two core components: (1) a novel chemically-aware, energy-based bond cleavage pre-training strategy that equips the GPT-based model with fragment growing, linking, and merging capabilities, and (2) a novel Reward Ranked Alignment with Expert Exploration (RAE) algorithm that combines expert imitation learning for diversity enhancement, data selection and augmentation for Pareto and composite score optimality, and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to align the learner policy with multi-objective goals. Conditioned on fragment pairs, FragmentGPT generates linkers that connect diverse molecular subunits while simultaneously optimizing for multiple pharmaceutical goals. It also learns to resolve structural redundancies-such as duplicated fragments-through intelligent merging, enabling the synthesis of optimized molecules. FragmentGPT facilitates controlled, goal-driven molecular assembly. Experiments and ablation studies on real-world cancer datasets demonstrate its ability to generate chemically valid, high-quality molecules tailored for downstream drug discovery tasks.

Protein-ligand binding affinity is critical in drug discovery, but experimentally determining it is time-consuming and expensive. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been used to predict binding affinity, significantly accelerating this process. However, the high-performance requirements and vast datasets involved in affinity prediction demand increasingly large AI models, requiring substantial computational resources and training time. Quantum machine learning has emerged as a promising solution to these challenges. In particular, hybrid quantum-classical models can reduce the number of parameters while maintaining or improving performance compared to classical counterparts. Despite these advantages, challenges persist: why hybrid quantum models achieve these benefits, whether quantum neural networks (QNNs) can replace classical neural networks, and whether such models are feasible on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. This study addresses these challenges by proposing a hybrid quantum neural network (HQNN) that empirically demonstrates the capability to approximate non-linear functions in the latent feature space derived from classical embedding. The primary goal of this study is to achieve a parameter-efficient model in binding affinity prediction while ensuring feasibility on NISQ devices. Numerical results indicate that HQNN achieves comparable or superior performance and parameter efficiency compared to classical neural networks, underscoring its potential as a viable replacement. This study highlights the potential of hybrid QML in computational drug discovery, offering insights into its applicability and advantages in addressing the computational challenges of protein-ligand binding affinity prediction.

Neural cellular automata: applications to biology and beyond classical AI
Benedikt Hartl, Michael Levin, Léo Pio-Lopez
Subjects:
Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Multiagent Systems (cs.MA); Other Quantitative Biology (q-bio.OT)
Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) represent a powerful framework for modeling biological self-organization, extending classical rule-based systems with trainable, differentiable (or evolvable) update rules that capture the adaptive self-regulatory dynamics of living matter. By embedding Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) as local decision-making centers and interaction rules between localized agents, NCA can simulate processes across molecular, cellular, tissue, and system-level scales, offering a multiscale competency architecture perspective on evolution, development, regeneration, aging, morphogenesis, and robotic control. These models not only reproduce biologically inspired target patterns but also generalize to novel conditions, demonstrating robustness to perturbations and the capacity for open-ended adaptation and reasoning. Given their immense success in recent developments, we here review current literature of NCAs that are relevant primarily for biological or bioengineering applications. Moreover, we emphasize that beyond biology, NCAs display robust and generalizing goal-directed dynamics without centralized control, e.g., in controlling or regenerating composite robotic morphologies or even on cutting-edge reasoning tasks such as ARC-AGI-1. In addition, the same principles of iterative state-refinement is reminiscent to modern generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), such as probabilistic diffusion models. Their governing self-regulatory behavior is constraint to fully localized interactions, yet their collective behavior scales into coordinated system-level outcomes. We thus argue that NCAs constitute a unifying computationally lean paradigm that not only bridges fundamental insights from multiscale biology with modern generative AI, but have the potential to design truly bio-inspired collective intelligence capable of hierarchical reasoning and control.

Subjects:

How regional heterogeneity in social and cultural processes drive--and respond to--climate dynamics is little studied. Here we present a coupled social-climate model stratified across five world regions and parameterized with geophysical, economic and social survey data. We find that support for mitigation evolves in a highly variable fashion across regions, according to socio-economics, climate vulnerability, and feedback from changing temperatures. Social learning and social norms can amplify existing sentiment about mitigation, leading to better or worse global warming outcomes depending on the region. Moreover, mitigation in one region, as mediated by temperature dynamics, can influence other regions to act, or just sit back, thus driving cross-regional heterogeneity in mitigation opinions. The peak temperature anomaly varies by several degrees Celsius depending on how these interactions unfold. Our model exemplifies a framework for studying how global geophysical processes interact with population-scale concerns to determine future sustainability outcomes.

Drug repurposing has historically been an economically infeasible process for identifying novel uses for abandoned drugs. Modern machine learning has enabled the identification of complex biochemical intricacies in candidate drugs; however, many studies rely on simplified datasets with known drug-disease similarities. We propose a machine learning pipeline that uses unsupervised deep embedded clustering, combined with supervised graph neural network link prediction to identify new drug-disease links from multi-omic data. Unsupervised autoencoder and cluster training reduced the dimensionality of omic data into a compressed latent embedding. A total of 9,022 unique drugs were partitioned into 35 clusters with a mean silhouette score of 0.8550. Graph neural networks achieved strong statistical performance, with a prediction accuracy of 0.901, receiver operating characteristic area under the curve of 0.960, and F1-Score of 0.901. A ranked list comprised of 477 per-cluster link probabilities exceeding 99 percent was generated. This study could provide new drug-disease link prospects across unrelated disease domains, while advancing the understanding of machine learning in drug repurposing studies.

The enzyme turnover rate is a fundamental parameter in enzyme kinetics, reflecting the catalytic efficiency of enzymes. However, enzyme turnover rates remain scarce across most organisms due to the high cost and complexity of experimental measurements. To address this gap, we propose a multimodal framework for predicting the enzyme turnover rate by integrating enzyme sequences, substrate structures, and environmental factors. Our model combines a pre-trained language model and a convolutional neural network to extract features from protein sequences, while a graph neural network captures informative representations from substrate molecules. An attention mechanism is incorporated to enhance interactions between enzyme and substrate representations. Furthermore, we leverage symbolic regression via Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks to explicitly learn mathematical formulas that govern the enzyme turnover rate, enabling interpretable and accurate predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms both traditional and state-of-the-art deep learning approaches. This work provides a robust tool for studying enzyme kinetics and holds promise for applications in enzyme engineering, biotechnology, and industrial biocatalysis.

Decoding the activity of the nervous system is a critical challenge in neuroscience and neural interfacing. In this study, we present a neuromuscular recording system that enables large-scale sampling of muscle activity using microelectrode arrays with over 100 channels embedded in forearm muscles. These arrays captured intramuscular high-density signals that were decoded into patterns of activation of spinal motoneurons. In two healthy participants, we recorded high-density intramuscular activity during single- and multi-digit contractions, revealing distinct motoneuron recruitment patterns specific to each task. Based on these patterns, we achieved perfect classification accuracy (100%) for 12 single- and multi-digit tasks and over 96% accuracy for up to 16 tasks, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art EMG classification methods. This intramuscular high-density system and classification method represent an advancement in neural interfacing, with the potential to improve human-computer interaction and the control of assistive technologies, particularly for replacing or restoring impaired motor function.

Quantitative Methods (q-bio.QM)
The FDA conducted a benefit-risk assessment for Moderna's COVID vaccine mRNA-1273 prior to its full approval, announced 1/31/2022. The FDA focused its assessment on males of ages 18-64 years because the agency's risk analysis was limited to vaccine-attributable myocarditis/pericarditis (VAM/P) given the excess risk among males. The FDA analysis concluded that vaccine benefits clearly outweighed risks, even for 18-25-year-old males (those at highest VAM/P risk). We reanalyze the FDA benefit-risk assessment using information available through the third week of January 2022 and focusing on 18-25-year-old males. We use the FDA's framework but extend its model by accounting for protection derived from prior COVID infection, finer age-stratification in COVID-hospitalization rates, and incidental hospitalizations (those of patients who test positive for COVID but are being treated for something else). We also use more realistic projections of Omicron-infection rates and more accurate rates of VAM/P. With hospitalizations as the principal endpoint of the analysis (those prevented by vaccination vs. those caused by VAM/P), our model finds vaccine risks outweighed benefits for 18-25-year-old males, except in scenarios projecting implausibly high Omicron-infection prevalence. Our assessment suggests that mRNA-1273 vaccination of 18-25-year-old males generated between 16% and 63% more hospitalizations from vaccine-attributable myocarditis/pericarditis alone compared to COVID hospitalizations prevented (over a 5-month period of vaccine protection assumed by the FDA). The preceding assessment is based on assumptions drawn from data available before 1/22/22. Moreover, these assumptions are validated by subsequently available data. Thus, we show that the outcome of a benefit-risk assessment for vaccination may be dramatically impacted by accounting for the benefits derived from prior infection

Subjects:
Neurons and Cognition (q-bio.NC)
The critical brain hypothesis posits that neural systems operate near a phase transition, optimizing the processing of information. While scale invariance and non-Gaussian dynamics--hallmarks of criticality--have been observed in brain activity, a direct link between criticality and behavioral performance remains unexplored. Here, we use a phenomenological renormalization group approach to examine neuronal activity in the primary visual cortex of mice performing a visual recognition task. We show that nontrivial scaling in neuronal activity is associated with enhanced task performance, with pronounced scaling observed during successful task completion. When rewards were removed or non-natural stimuli presented, scaling signatures diminished. These results suggest that critical dynamics in the brain is crucial for optimizing behavioral outcomes, offering new insights into the functional role of criticality in cortical processing.

In the study of life's origins, a key challenge is understanding how RNA could have polymerized and subsequently replicated in early Earth. We present a theoretical and computational framework to model the non-enzymatic polymerization of ribonucleotides and the template-dependent replication of primordial RNA molecules, at the interfaces between the aqueous solution and a clay mineral. Our results demonstrate that systematic polymerization and replication of single-stranded RNA polymers, sufficiently long to fold and acquire basic functions ($>$15 nt), were feasible under these conditions. Crucially, this process required a physico-chemical environment characterized by large-amplitude oscillations with periodicity compatible with spring tide dynamics, suggesting that large moons may have played a role in the emergence of RNA-based life on planetary bodies. Interestingly, the theoretical analysis presents rigorous evidence that RNA replication efficiency increases in oscillating environments compared to constant ones. Moreover, the versatility of our framework enables comparisons between different genetic alphabets, showing that a four-letter alphabet -- particularly when allowing non-canonical base pairs, as in current RNA -- represents an optimal balance of replication speed and sequence diversity in the pathway to life.

Neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI) both face the challenge of interpreting high-dimensional neural data, where the comparative analysis of such data is crucial for revealing shared mechanisms and differences between these complex systems. Despite the widespread use of representational comparisons and the abundance classes of comparison methods, a critical question remains: which metrics are most suitable for these comparisons? While some studies evaluate metrics based on their ability to differentiate models of different origins or constructions (e.g., various architectures), another approach is to assess how well they distinguish models that exhibit distinct behaviors. To investigate this, we examine the degree of alignment between various representational similarity measures and behavioral outcomes, employing group statistics and a comprehensive suite of behavioral metrics for comparison. In our evaluation of eight commonly used representational similarity metrics in the visual domain -- spanning alignment-based, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)-based, inner product kernel-based, and nearest-neighbor methods -- we found that metrics like linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Procrustes distance, which emphasize the overall geometric structure or shape of representations, excelled in differentiating trained from untrained models and aligning with behavioral measures, whereas metrics such as linear predictivity, commonly used in neuroscience, demonstrated only moderate alignment with behavior. These insights are crucial for selecting metrics that emphasize behaviorally meaningful comparisons in NeuroAI research.

Graceful forgetting: Memory as a process
Alain de Cheveigné
Subjects:
Neurons and Cognition (q-bio.NC); Information Retrieval (cs.IR); Machine Learning (cs.LG)
A rational framework is proposed to explain how we accommodate unbounded sensory input within bounded memory. Memory is stored as statistics organized into structures that are repeatedly summarized and compressed to make room for new input. Repeated summarization requires an intensive ongoing process guided by heuristics that help optimize the memory for future needs. Sensory input is rapidly encoded as simple statistics that are progressively elaborated into more abstract constructs. This framework differs from previous accounts of memory by its emphasis on a process that is intensive, complex, and expensive, its reliance on statistics as a representation of memory, and the use of heuristics to guide the choice of statistics at each summarization step. The framework is intended as an aid to make sense of our extensive knowledge of memory, and bring us closer to an understanding of memory in functional and mechanistic terms.

How DNA-binding proteins locate specific genomic targets remains a central challenge in molecular biology. Traditional protein-centric approaches, which rely on wet-lab experiments and visualization techniques, often lack genome-wide resolution and fail to capture physiological dynamics in living cells. Here, we introduce a DNA-centric strategy that leverages in vivo N6-methyladenine (6mA) data to decode the logic of protein-DNA recognition. By integrating linguistically inspired modeling with machine learning, we reveal two distinct search modes: a protein-driven diffusion mechanism and a DNA sequence-driven mechanism, wherein specific motifs function as protein traps. We further reconstruct high-resolution interaction landscapes at the level of individual sequences and trace the evolutionary trajectories of recognition motifs across species. This framework addresses fundamental limitations of protein-centered approaches and positions DNA itself as an intrinsic reporter of protein-binding behavior.

Enhancing U.S. swine farm preparedness for infectious foreign animal diseases with rapid access to biosecurity information

Subjects:
Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE)
The U.S. launched the Secure Pork Supply (SPS) Plan for Continuity of Business, a voluntary program providing foreign animal disease (FAD) guidance and setting biosecurity standards to maintain business continuity amid FAD outbreaks. The role of biosecurity in disease prevention is well recognized, yet the U.S. swine industry lacks knowledge of individual farm biosecurity plans and the efficacy of existing measures. We describe a multi-sector initiative that formed the Rapid Access Biosecurity (RAB) app consortium with the swine industry, government, and academia. We (i) summarized 7,625 farms using RABapp, (ii) mapped U.S. commercial swine coverage and areas of limited biosecurity, and (iii) examined associations between biosecurity and occurrences of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV).
RABapp, used in 31 states, covers ~47% of U.S. commercial swine. Of 307 Agricultural Statistics Districts with swine, 78% (238) had <50% of those animals in RABapp. We used a mixed-effects logistic regression model, accounting for production company and farm type (breeding vs. non-breeding). Requiring footwear/clothing changes, having multiple carcass disposal locations, hosting other businesses, and greater distance to swine farms reduced infection odds. Rendering carcasses, manure pit storage or land application, multiple perimeter buffer areas, and a larger animal housing area increased risk. This study leveraged RABapp to assess U.S. swine farm biosecurity, revealing gaps in SPS plan adoption that create vulnerable regions. Some biosecurity practices (e.g., footwear changes) lowered PRRSV/PEDV risk, while certain disposal and manure practices increased it. Targeted biosecurity measures and broader RABapp adoption can bolster industry resilience against foreign animal diseases.

In this study, the distributions of protein structure classes (or folding types) of experimentally determined structures from a legacy dataset and a comprehensive database (SCOP) are modeled precisely with geometric constructs such as convex polytopes in high-dimensional amino acid composition space. This is a follow-up of a previous non-statistical, geometry-motivated modeling of protein classes with ellipsoidal models, which is superseded presently in three important respects: (1) as a paradigm shift a descriptive 'distribution model' of experimental data is de-coupled from, and serves as the basis for, a possible future predictive 'domain model' generalizable to proteins in the same class for which 3D structures have yet to be determined experimentally, (2) the geometric and analytic characteristics of class distributions are obtained via exact computational geometry calculations, and (3) the full data from a comprehensive database are included in such calculations, eschewing training set selection and biases. In contrast to statistical and machine-learning approaches, the analytical, non-statistical geometry models of protein class distributions demonstrated in this study furnish complete and precise information on their size and relative disposition in the high-dimensional space (vis-à-vis any overlaps leading to ambiguity and classification limits). Intended primarily as an accurate and summary description of the complex relationships between amino acid composition and protein classes, and suitably as a basis for predictive modeling where possible, the results suggest that pen-ultimately they may be useful adjuncts for validating sequence-based protein structure predictions and contribute to theoretical and fundamental understanding of secondary structure formation and protein folding, demonstrating the role of high dimensional amino acid composition space in protein studies.

Neural recording technologies now enable simultaneous recording of population activity across many brain regions, motivating the development of data-driven models of communication between brain regions. However, existing models can struggle to disentangle the sources that influence recorded neural populations, leading to inaccurate portraits of inter-regional communication. Here, we introduce Multi-Region Latent Factor Analysis via Dynamical Systems (MR-LFADS), a sequential variational autoencoder designed to disentangle inter-regional communication, inputs from unobserved regions, and local neural population dynamics. We show that MR-LFADS outperforms existing approaches at identifying communication across dozens of simulations of task-trained multi-region networks. When applied to large-scale electrophysiology, MR-LFADS predicts brain-wide effects of circuit perturbations that were held out during model fitting. These validations on synthetic and real neural data position MR-LFADS as a promising tool for discovering principles of brain-wide information processing.

NIRS: An Ontology for Non-Invasive Respiratory Support in Acute Care
Md Fantacher Islam, Jarrod Mosier, Vignesh Subbian
Subjects:
Other Quantitative Biology (q-bio.OT); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)
Objective: Managing patients with respiratory failure increasingly involves non-invasive respiratory support (NIRS) strategies as alternatives to traditional ventilation methods. However, despite the rapidly expanding use of NIRS, there is a significant challenge to its best use under all medical circumstances. It lacks a unified ontological structure, complicating guidance on NIRS modalities across healthcare systems. Our goal is to develop NIRS ontology to support knowledge representation in acute care settings by providing a unified framework that enhances data clarity, interoperability, and clinical decision-making.
Methods: We developed the NIRS ontology using Web Ontology Language (OWL) semantics and Protege to organize clinical concepts and relationships. To enable rule-based clinical reasoning beyond hierarchical structures, we added Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) rules. We evaluated logical reasoning by adding 17 hypothetical clinical scenarios. We used SPARQL queries to retrieve and test targeted inferences.
Results: The ontology has 129 classes, 11 object properties, and 17 data properties across 886 axioms that establish concept relationships. To standardize clinical concepts, we added 361 annotations, including descriptive definitions based on controlled vocabularies. SPARQL queries successfully validated all test cases (rules) by retrieving appropriate patient outcomes: for instance, a patient treated with HFNC (high-flow nasal cannula) for 2 hours due to acute respiratory failure may avoid endotracheal intubation.
Conclusion: We developed an ontology that captures NIRS modalities in a unified framework and demonstrated its applicability through the evaluation of hypothetical patient scenarios and alignment with standardized vocabularies, which may need to be expanded to encompass a broader scope.

Subjects:
Other Quantitative Biology (q-bio.OT)
The spotted lanternfly is rapidly establishing itself as a major insect pest with global implications. Despite significant management efforts, its spread continues in invaded regions, and refined management strategies are required. A recent study introduced a model that generalized the results of empirical control efficacy studies by incorporating population dynamics and incomplete delivery. In particular, a generalized population growth formula was derived, providing the minimum proportion of a population that must be treated with a given control to induce population decline. However, this model could not address the more relevant question of how best to deploy a control to minimize population growth. Here, we extend this model and formula to address this question in various settings. When the effect of control is proportional to effort, we show that exhaustive sequential deployment of stage-specific controls, ordered by efficacy, is optimal. When control effects exhibit diminishing returns with effort, we derive a formula for when to switch controls, providing an effective strategy in situations where management resources may vary or be cut at any time. We also use numerical global optimization methods to obtain strategies when resources are fixed a priori. Both strategies outperform random deployment, which can result in disastrous outcomes. Our results demonstrate that adopting an effective strategy for deploying stage-specific controls is essential for managing the spotted lanternfly. However, we found no papers addressing this topic in the lanternfly literature, nor information on whether such strategies are used. Given the limited resources available to combat the lanternfly, it is critical that they are used effectively. The approach introduced here, along with other optimization methods used in related fields, can contribute to this goal.

Binomial maps: stochastically evolving iterated integer maps for finite populations

Subjects:

Many models of population dynamics are formulated as deterministic iterated maps although real populations are stochastic. This is justifiable in the limit of large population sizes, as the stochastic fluctuations are negligible then. However, this also makes it challenging to use the same models for small populations where finite size effects like demographic noise and extinction cannot be ignored. Moreover, adding noise to the equations does not solve this problem as it can only represent the environmental stochasticity. An approach, sometimes used in ecological literature, but surprisingly uncommon in dynamical systems community, is \emph{Binomial maps}, which allow stochastic evolution of deterministic iterated map models of population. Here we present their formulation in a way so as to make their connection to the agent-based models explicit, and demonstrate it for the Logistic and Ricker maps. We also show that the Binomial maps are not completely equivalent to their deterministic counterparts, and derive sufficient conditions under which the equivalence holds. This approach enables rigorous finite-population analysis within familiar map-based models, bridging the deterministic map models and stochastic agent-based models.

Canonicalization of the E value from BLAST similarity search -- dissimilarity measure and distance function for a metric space of protein sequences

Biomolecules (q-bio.BM); Quantitative Methods (q-bio.QM)
Sequence matching algorithms such as BLAST and FASTA have been widely used in searching for evolutionary origin and biological functions of newly discovered nucleic acid and protein sequences. As parts of these search tools, alignment scores and E values are useful indicators of the quality of search results from querying a database of annotated sequences, whereby a high alignment score (and inversely a low E value) reflects significant similarity between the query and the subject (target) sequences. For cross-comparison of results from sufficiently different queries however, the interpretation of alignment score as a similarity measure and E value a dissimilarity measure becomes somewhat nuanced, and prompts herein a judicious distinction of different types of similarity. We show that an adjustment of E value to account for self-matching of query and subject sequences corrects for certain ostensibly anomalous similarity comparisons, resulting in canonical dissimilarity and similarity measures that would be more appropriate for database applications, such as all-on-all sequence alignment or selection of diverse subsets. In actual practice, the canonicalization of E value dissimilarity improves clustering and the diversity of subset selection. While both E value and the canonical E value share positivity and symmetry, two of the four axiomatic properties of a metric space, the canonical E value is also reflexive and meets the condition of triangle inequality, thus itself an appropriate distance function for a metric space of protein sequences.

Artificial Intelligence as an Opportunity for the Science of Consciousness: A Dual-Resolution Framework
Shahar Dror, Dafna Bergerbest, Moti Salti
Subjects:
Neurons and Cognition (q-bio.NC)
The encounter of artificial intelligence with consciousness research is often framed as a challenge: could this science determine whether such systems are conscious? We suggest it is equally an opportunity to expand and test the scope of existing theories of consciousness. Current approaches remain polarized. Computational functionalism emphasizes abstract organization, often realized through neural correlates of consciousness, while biological naturalism insists that consciousness is tied to living embodiment. Both positions risk anthropocentrism and limit the possibility of recognizing non-biological forms of subjectivity. To move beyond this impasse, we propose a dual-resolution framework that defines the ontological and epistemic conditions for consciousness. This approach combines the Information Theory of Individuality, which defines the ontological conditions of informational autonomy and self-maintenance, with the Moment-to-Moment theory, which specifies the epistemic conditions of temporal updating and phenomenological unfolding. This integration reframes consciousness as the epistemic expression of individuated systems in substrate-independent informational terms, offering a generalizable theory of consciousness and positioning AI as a promising testbed for its emergence.

Terrestrial animals often must self-right from an upside-down orientation on the ground to survive. Here, we compared self-righting strategies of the Madagascar hissing, American, and discoid cockroaches on a challenging flat, rigid, low-friction surface to quantify the mechanical principles. All three species almost always self-righted (97% probability) when given time (30 seconds), frequently self-righted (63%) on the first attempt, and on that attempt did so in one second or less. When successful, two of the three species gained and used pitch and/or roll rotational kinetic energy to overcome potential energy barriers (American 63% of all attempts and discoid 78%). By contrast, the largest, heaviest, wingless cockroach (Madagascar hissing) relied far less on the energy of motion and was the slowest to self-right. Two of the three species used rolling strategies to overcome low potential energy barriers. Successful righting attempts had greater rolling rotation than failed attempts as the center of mass rose to the highest position. Madagascar hissing cockroaches rolled using body deformation (98% of all trials) and the American cockroach relied on leg forces (93%). By contrast, the discoid cockroach overcame higher and a wider range of potential energy barriers with simultaneous pitching and rolling using wings (46% of all trials) and legs (49%) equally to self-right. Our quantification revealed the performance advantages of using rotational kinetic energy to overcome the potential energy barrier and rolling more to lower it, while maintaining diverse strategies for ground-based self-righting.

Many snakes live in deserts, forests, and river valleys and traverse challenging 3-D terrain like rocks, felled trees, and rubble, with obstacles as large as themselves and variable surface properties. By contrast, apart from branch cantilevering, burrowing, swimming, and gliding, laboratory studies of snake locomotion focused on that on simple flat surfaces. Here, to begin to understand snake locomotion in complex 3-D terrain, we study how the variable kingsnake, a terrestrial generalist, traversed a large step of variable surface friction and step height (up to 30% snout-vent length). The snake traversed by partitioning its body into three sections with distinct functions. Body sections below and above the step oscillated laterally on horizontal surfaces for propulsion, while the body section in between cantilevered in a vertical plane to bridge the large height increase. As the animal progressed, these three sections traveled down its body, conforming overall body shape to the step. In addition, the snake adjusted the partitioned gait in response to increase in step height and decrease in surface friction, at the cost of reduced speed. As surface friction decreased, body movement below and above the step changed from a continuous lateral undulation with little slip to an intermittent oscillatory movement with much slip, and initial head lift-off became closer to the step. Given these adjustments, body partitioning allowed the snake to be always stable, even when initially cantilevering but before reaching the surface above. Such a partitioned gait may be generally useful for diverse, complex 3-D terrain.

Terradynamically streamlined shapes in animals and robots enhances traversability through densely cluttered terrain

Many animals, modern aircraft, and underwater vehicles use streamlined body shapes that reduce fluid dynamic drag to achieve fast and effective locomotion in air and water. Similarly, numerous small terrestrial animals move through cluttered terrain where 3-D, multi-component obstacles like grass, shrubs, vines, and leaf litter resist motion, but it is unknown whether their body shape plays a major role in traversal. Few ground vehicles or terrestrial robots have used body shape to effectively traverse cluttered terrain. Here, we challenged forest-floor-dwelling discoid cockroaches possessing a thin, rounded body to traverse tall, narrowly spaced, vertical, grass-like compliant beams. Animals displayed high traversal performance (79 +/- 12% probability and 3.4 +/- 0.7 s time). Although we observed diverse traversal strategies, cockroaches primarily (48 +/- 9 % probability) used a novel roll maneuver, allowing them to rapidly traverse obstacle gaps narrower than half body width (2.0 +/- 0.5 s traversal time). Reduction of body roundness by addition of artificial shells nearly inhibited roll maneuvers and decreased traversal performance. Inspired by this discovery, we added a thin, rounded exoskeletal shell to a legged robot with a nearly cuboidal body, common to many existing terrestrial robots. Without adding sensory feedback or changing the open-loop control, the rounded shell enabled the robot to traverse beam obstacles with gaps narrower than shell width via body roll. Terradynamically streamlined shapes can reduce terrain resistance and enhance traversability by assisting effective body reorientation via distributed mechanical feedback. Our findings highlight the need to consider body shape to improve robot mobility in real-world terrain often filled with clutter, and to develop better locomotor-ground contact models to understand interaction with complex terrain.

Recent advances in Protein Language Models (PLMs) have transformed protein engineering, yet unlike their counterparts in Natural Language Processing (NLP), current PLMs exhibit a fundamental limitation: they excel in either Protein Language Understanding (PLU) or Protein Language Generation (PLG), but rarely both. This fragmentation hinders progress in protein engineering. To bridge this gap, we introduce ProLLaMA, a multitask protein language model enhanced by the Evolutionary Protein Generation Framework (EPGF). We construct a comprehensive instruction dataset containing approximately 13 million samples with over 11,000 superfamily annotations to facilitate better modeling of sequence-function landscapes. We leverage a two-stage training approach to develop ProLLaMA, a multitask LLM with protein domain expertise. Our EPGF addresses the mismatch between statistic language modeling and biological constraints through three innovations: a multi-dimensional interpretable scorer, hierarchical efficient decoding, and a probabilistic-biophysical joint selection mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ProLLaMA excels in both unconditional and controllable protein generation tasks, achieving superior structural quality metrics compared to existing PLMs. Additionally, ProLLaMA demonstrates strong understanding capabilities with a 67.1% exact match rate in superfamily prediction. EPGF significantly enhances the biological viability of generated sequences, as evidenced by improved biophysical scores (+4.3%) and structural metrics (+14.5%).

Eukaryotic cells demonstrate a wide variety of dynamic patterns of filamentous actin (F-actin) and its regulators. Some of these patterns play important roles in cell functions, such as distinct motility modes, which motivate this study. We devise a mass-conserved reaction-diffusion model for active and inactive Rho-GTPase and F-actin in the cell cortex. The mass-conserved Rho-GTPase system promotes F-actin, which feeds back to inactivate the former. We study the model on a 1D periodic domain (edge of thin sheet-like cell) using bifurcation theory in the framework of spatial dynamics, complemented with numerical simulations. Among several discussed bifurcations, the analysis centers on the study of the codimension-2 long wavelength and finite wavenumber Hopf instability, in which we describe a rich structure of steady wave-pinning states (a.k.a. mesas, obeying the Maxwell construction), propagating coherent solutions (fronts and excitable pulses), and travelling and standing waves, all distinguished by mass conservation regimes and classified by domain sizes. Specifically, we highlight the unexpected conditions for bistability between steady wave-pinning and travelling wave states on moderate domain sizes. These results uncover and exemplify possible mechanisms of coexistence, robustness, and transitions between distinct cellular motility modes, including directed migration, turning, and ruffling. More broadly, the results indicate that dissipative reaction-diffusion models comprising mass conservation have distinct pattern formation mechanisms that motivate further investigations, such as the unfolding of codimension-3 instabilities and T-points.

Arbor is a software library designed for efficient simulation of large-scale networks of biological neurons with detailed morphological structures. It combines customizable neuronal and synaptic mechanisms with high-performance computing, supporting multi-core CPU and GPU systems.
In humans and other animals, synaptic plasticity processes play a vital role in cognitive functions [...]
To enable the modeling of large-scale networks of morphologically detailed neurons with diverse plasticity processes, we have extended the Arbor library to support simulations of a large variety of spike-driven plasticity paradigms. To showcase the features of the extended framework, we present examples of computational models, beginning with single-synapse dynamics, progressing to multi-synapse rules, and finally scaling up to large recurrent networks. While cross-validating our implementations by comparison with other simulators, we show that Arbor allows simulating plastic networks of multi-compartment neurons at nearly no additional cost in runtime compared to point-neuron simulations. In addition, we demonstrate that Arbor is highly efficient in terms of runtime and memory use as compared to other simulators.
Using the extended framework, as an example, we investigate the impact of dendritic structures on network dynamics across a timescale of several hours, finding a relation between the length of dendritic trees and the ability of the network to efficiently store information.
By our extension of Arbor, we aim to provide a valuable tool that will support future studies on the impact of synaptic plasticity, especially, in conjunction with neuronal morphology, in large networks.

Statistical-physics calculations in machine learning and theoretical neuroscience often involve lengthy derivations that obscure physical interpretation. Here, we give concise, non-replica derivations of several key results and highlight their underlying similarities. In particular, using a cavity approach, we analyze three high-dimensional learning problems: perceptron classification of points, perceptron classification of manifolds, and kernel ridge regression. These problems share a common structure--a bipartite system of interacting feature and datum variables--enabling a unified analysis. Furthermore, for perceptron-capacity problems, we identify a symmetry that allows derivation of correct capacities through a naive method.

Finding process pathways in molecular simulations such as the unbinding paths of small molecule ligands from their binding sites at protein targets in a set of trajectories via unsupervised learning approaches requires the definition of a suitable similarity measure between trajectories. We here evaluate the performance of four such measures with varying degree of sophistication, i.e., Euclidean and Wasserstein distances, Procrustes analysis and dynamical time warping, when analyzing trajectory data from two different biased simulation driving protocols in the form of constant velocity constraint targeted MD and steered MD. In a streptavidin-biotin benchmark system with known ground truth clusters, Wasserstein distances yielded the best clustering performance, closely followed by Euclidean distances, both being the most computationally efficient similarity measures. In a more complex A2a receptor-inhibitor system, however, the simplest measure, i.e., Euclidean distances, was sufficient to reveal meaningful and interpretable clusters.

A major challenge in diagnosing and treating cancer is the infiltrative growth of tumors into surrounding tissues.
This microscopic spread of the disease is invisible on most diagnostic imaging modalities and can often only be detected histologically in biopsies.
The purpose of this paper is to develop a physically based model of tumor spread that captures the histologically observed behavior in terms of seeding small tumor islets in prostate cancer.
The model is based on three elementary events: a tumor cell can move, duplicate, or die.
The propensity of each event is given by an Ising-like Hamiltonian that captures correlations between neighboring cells.
The model parameters were fitted to clinical data obtained from surgical specimens taken from 23 prostate cancer patients.
The results demonstrate that this straightforward physical model effectively describes the distribution of the size and the number of tumor islets in prostate cancer.
The simulated tumor islets exhibit a regular, approximately spherical shape, correctly mimicking the shapes observed in histology.
This is due to the Ising interaction term between neighboring cells acting as a surface tension that gives rise to regularly shaped islets.
The model addresses the important clinical need of calculating the probability of tumor involvement in specific sub-volumes of the prostate, which is required for radiation treatment planning and other applications.

Vendi Information Gain for Active Learning and its Application to Ecology

Subjects:
Machine Learning (cs.LG); Information Theory (cs.IT); Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE)
While monitoring biodiversity through camera traps has become an important endeavor for ecological research, identifying species in the captured image data remains a major bottleneck due to limited labeling resources. Active learning -- a machine learning paradigm that selects the most informative data to label and train a predictive model -- offers a promising solution, but typically focuses on uncertainty in the individual predictions without considering uncertainty across the entire dataset. We introduce a new active learning policy, Vendi information gain (VIG), that selects images based on their impact on dataset-wide prediction uncertainty, capturing both informativeness and diversity. We applied VIG to the Snapshot Serengeti dataset and compared it against common active learning methods. VIG needs only 3% of the available data to reach 75\% accuracy, a level that baselines require more than 10% of the data to achieve. With 10% of the data, VIG attains 88\% predictive accuracy, 12% higher than the best of the baselines. This improvement in performance is consistent across metrics and batch sizes, and we show that VIG also collects more diverse data in the feature space. VIG has broad applicability beyond ecology, and our results highlight its value for biodiversity monitoring in data-limited environments.
