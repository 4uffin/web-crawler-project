Title:
Property-Isometric Variational Autoencoders for Sequence Modeling and Design

Biological sequence design (DNA, RNA, or peptides) with desired functional properties has applications in discovering novel nanomaterials, biosensors, antimicrobial drugs, and beyond. One common challenge is the ability to optimize complex high-dimensional properties such as target emission spectra of DNA-mediated fluorescent nanoparticles, photo and chemical stability, and antimicrobial activity of peptides across target microbes. Existing models rely on simple binary labels (e.g., binding/non-binding) rather than high-dimensional complex properties. To address this gap, we propose a geometry-preserving variational autoencoder framework, called PrIVAE, which learns latent sequence embeddings that respect the geometry of their property space. Specifically, we model the property space as a high-dimensional manifold that can be locally approximated by a nearest neighbor graph, given an appropriately defined distance measure. We employ the property graph to guide the sequence latent representations using (1) graph neural network encoder layers and (2) an isometric regularizer. PrIVAE learns a property-organized latent space that enables rational design of new sequences with desired properties by employing the trained decoder. We evaluate the utility of our framework for two generative tasks: (1) design of DNA sequences that template fluorescent metal nanoclusters and (2) design of antimicrobial peptides. The trained models retain high reconstruction accuracy while organizing the latent space according to properties. Beyond in silico experiments, we also employ sampled sequences for wet lab design of DNA nanoclusters, resulting in up to 16.1-fold enrichment of rare-property nanoclusters compared to their abundance in training data, demonstrating the practical utility of our framework.

Embodied sensorimotor control: computational modeling of the neural control of movement

Review paper
Subjects:
Neurons and Cognition (q-bio.NC); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)
We review how sensorimotor control is dictated by interacting neural populations, optimal feedback mechanisms, and the biomechanics of bodies. First, we outline the distributed anatomical loops that shuttle sensorimotor signals between cortex, subcortical regions, and spinal cord. We then summarize evidence that neural population activity occupies low-dimensional, dynamically evolving manifolds during planning and execution of movements. Next, we summarize literature explaining motor behavior through the lens of optimal control theory, which clarifies the role of internal models and feedback during motor control. Finally, recent studies on embodied sensorimotor control address gaps within each framework by aiming to elucidate neural population activity through the explicit control of musculoskeletal dynamics. We close by discussing open problems and opportunities: multi-tasking and cognitively rich behavior, multi-regional circuit models, and the level of anatomical detail needed in body and network models. Together, this review and recent advances point towards reaching an integrative account of the neural control of movement.

Title:
Theoretical Note: The Relation Between Structure and Dynamics in Psychological Networks of Attitudes
Mark G. Orr, Emily S. Teti, Andrei Bura, Henning Mortveit
Subjects:
Neurons and Cognition (q-bio.NC)
Two claims of the Causal Attitude Network (CAN) model and the descendent Attitude Entropy framework (AE) are indicative of significant theoretical hurdles facing the psychological network modeling efforts of attitudes. The first claim is that the dynamics of change in an Ising like attitude network, under perturbation of any one single node, can be inferred from the static network attributes of said node. The second claim is that psychological network models of attitudes with Ising like dynamics will maximize both attitudinal consistency and accuracy when within the small world topological regime. The first claim, one with significant application potentials, has not been sufficiently tested; the second claim, one with high theoretical novelty, has never been addressed. Using a set of analytic results and simulations, we found little support for these claims; in short, the predictions are not logically consistent with the theory. Our results have implications beyond attitude models to the larger field of psychological networks (e.g., in clinical psychology) in reference to how we should explain and understand their dynamics.

Mouse vs. AI: A Neuroethological Benchmark for Visual Robustness and Neural Alignment
Marius Schneider, Joe Canzano, Jing Peng, Yuchen Hou, Spencer LaVere Smith, Michael Beyeler
Subjects:
Neurons and Cognition (q-bio.NC)
Visual robustness under real-world conditions remains a critical bottleneck for modern reinforcement learning agents. In contrast, biological systems such as mice show remarkable resilience to environmental changes, maintaining stable performance even under degraded visual input with minimal exposure. Inspired by this gap, we propose the Mouse vs. AI: Robust Foraging Competition, a novel bioinspired visual robustness benchmark to test generalization in reinforcement learning (RL) agents trained to navigate a virtual environment toward a visually cued target. Participants train agents to perform a visually guided foraging task in a naturalistic 3D Unity environment and are evaluated on their ability to generalize to unseen, ecologically realistic visual perturbations. What sets this challenge apart is its biological grounding: real mice performed the same task, and participants receive both behavioral performance data and large-scale neural recordings (over 19,000 neurons across visual cortex) for benchmarking. The competition features two tracks: (1) Visual Robustness, assessing generalization across held-out visual perturbations; and (2) Neural Alignment, evaluating how well agents' internal representations predict mouse visual cortical activity via a linear readout. We provide the full Unity environment, a fog-perturbed training condition for validation, baseline proximal policy optimization (PPO) agents, and a rich multimodal dataset. By bridging reinforcement learning, computer vision, and neuroscience through a shared, behaviorally grounded task, this challenge advances the development of robust, generalizable, and biologically inspired AI.

Title:
Charting trajectories of human thought using large language models
Matthew M Nour, Daniel C McNamee, Isaac Fradkin, Raymond J Dolan
Subjects:
Neurons and Cognition (q-bio.NC)
Language provides the most revealing window into the ways humans structure conceptual knowledge within cognitive maps. Harnessing this information has been difficult, given the challenge of reliably mapping words to mental concepts. Artificial Intelligence large language models (LLMs) now offer unprecedented opportunities to revisit this challenge. LLMs represent words and phrases as high-dimensional numerical vectors that encode vast semantic knowledge. To harness this potential for cognitive science, we introduce VECTOR, a computational framework that aligns LLM representations with human cognitive map organisation. VECTOR casts a participant's verbal reports as a geometric trajectory through a cognitive map representation, revealing how thoughts flow from one idea to the next. Applying VECTOR to narratives generated by 1,100 participants, we show these trajectories have cognitively meaningful properties that predict paralinguistic behaviour (response times) and real-world communication patterns. We suggest our approach opens new avenues for understanding how humans dynamically organise and navigate conceptual knowledge in naturalistic settings.

This study compares the predictive capacity of the Dynamic Habitat Index (DHI) - a remote sensing (RS)-based measure of habitat productivity and variability - against traditional land-use/land-cover (LULC) metrics in species distribution modelling (SDM) applications. RS and LULC-based SDMs were built using distribution data for eleven bird, amphibian, and mammal species in Île-de-France. Predictor variables were derived from Sentinel-2 RS data and LULC classifications, with the latter incorporating Euclidean distance to habitat types. Ensemble SDMs were built using nine algorithms and evaluated with the Continuous Boyce Index (CBI) and a calibrated AUC. Habitat suitability scores and their binary transformations were assessed using niche overlap indices (Schoener, Warren, and Spearman rank correlation coefficient). Both RS and LULC approaches exhibited similar predictive accuracy overall. After binarisation however, the resulting niche maps diverged significantly. While LULC-based models exhibited spatial constraints (habitat suitability decreased as distance from recorded occurrences increased), RS-based models, which used continuous data, were not affected by geographic bias or distance effects. These results underscore the need to account for spatial biases in LULC-based SDMs. The DHI may offer a more spatially neutral alternative, making it a promising predictor for modelling species niches at regional scales.

Title:
Network representations reveal structured uncertainty in music

Music, as a structured yet perceptually rich experience, can be modeled as a network to uncover how humans encode and process auditory information. While network-based representations of music are increasingly common, the impact of feature selection on structural properties and cognitive alignment remains underexplored. In this study, we evaluated eight network models, each constructed from symbolic representations of piano compositions using distinct combinations of pitch, octave, duration, and interval, designed to be representative of existing approaches in the literature. By comparing these models through topological metrics, entropy analysis, and divergence with respect to inferred cognitive representations, we assessed both their structural and perceptual efficiency. Our findings reveal that simpler, feature-specific models better match human perception, whereas complex, multidimensional representations introduce cognitive inefficiencies. These results support the view that humans rely on modular, parallel cognitive networks--an architecture consistent with theories of predictive processing and free energy minimization. Moreover, we find that musical networks are structurally organized to guide attention toward transitions that are both uncertain and inferable. The resulting structure concentrates uncertainty in a few frequently visited nodes, creating local entropy gradients that alternate between stable and unpredictable regions, thereby enabling the expressive dynamics of tension and release that define the musical experience. These findings show that network structures make the organization of uncertainty in music observable, offering new insight into how patterned flows of expectation shape perception, and open new directions for studying how musical structures evolve across genres, cultures, and historical periods through the lens of network science.

From genomes and ecosystems to bureaucracies and cities, the growth of complex systems occurs by adding new types of functions and expanding existing ones. We present a simple generative model that generalizes the Yule-Simon process by including: (i) a size-dependent probability of introducing new functions, and (ii) a generalized preferential attachment mechanism for expanding existing ones. We uncover a shared underlying structure that helps explain how function diversity evolves in empirical observations, such as prokaryotic proteomes, U.S. federal agencies, and urban economies. We show that real systems are often best represented as having non-Zipfian rank-frequency distributions, driven by sublinear preferential attachment, whilst still maintaining power-law scaling in their abundance distributions. Furthermore, our analytics explain five distinct phases of the organization of functional elements across complex systems. The model integrates empirical findings regarding the logarithmic growth of diversity in cities and the self-similarity of their rank-frequency distributions. Self-similarity previously observed in the rank-frequency distributions of cities is not observed in cells and federal agencies -- however, under a rescaling relative to the total diversity, all systems admit self-similar structures predicted by our theory.

Lossy data transformations by definition lose information. Yet, in modern machine learning, methods like data pruning and lossy data augmentation can help improve generalization performance. We study this paradox using a solvable model of high-dimensional, ridge-regularized linear regression under 'data coarse graining.' Inspired by the renormalization group in statistical physics, we analyze coarse-graining schemes that systematically discard features based on their relevance to the learning task. Our results reveal a nonmonotonic dependence of the prediction risk on the degree of coarse graining. A 'high-pass' scheme--which filters out less relevant, lower-signal features--can help models generalize better. By contrast, a 'low-pass' scheme that integrates out more relevant, higher-signal features is purely detrimental. Crucially, using optimal regularization, we demonstrate that this nonmonotonicity is a distinct effect of data coarse graining and not an artifact of double descent. Our framework offers a clear, analytical explanation for why careful data augmentation works: it strips away less relevant degrees of freedom and isolates more predictive signals. Our results highlight a complex, nonmonotonic risk landscape shaped by the structure of the data, and illustrate how ideas from statistical physics provide a principled lens for understanding modern machine learning phenomena.

Accurate identification of drug-target interactions (DTI) remains a central challenge in computational pharmacology, where sequence-based methods offer scalability. This work introduces a sequence-based drug-target interaction framework that integrates structural priors into protein representations while maintaining high-throughput screening capability. Evaluated across multiple benchmarks, the model achieves state-of-the-art performance on Human and BioSNAP datasets and remains competitive on BindingDB. In virtual screening tasks, it surpasses prior methods on LIT-PCBA, yielding substantial gains in AUROC and BEDROC. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of learned aggregation, bilinear attention, and contrastive alignment in enhancing predictive robustness. Embedding visualizations reveal improved spatial correspondence with known binding pockets and highlight interpretable attention patterns over ligand-residue contacts. These results validate the framework's utility for scalable and structure-aware DTI prediction.

Cortical surface reconstruction (CSR) from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is fundamental to neuroimage analysis, enabling morphological studies of the cerebral cortex and functional brain mapping. Recent advances in learning-based CSR have dramatically accelerated processing, allowing for reconstructions through the deformation of anatomical templates within seconds. However, ensuring the learned deformations are optimal in terms of deformation energy and consistent across training runs remains a particular challenge. In this work, we design a Minimal Energy Deformation (MED) loss, acting as a regularizer on the deformation trajectories and complementing the widely used Chamfer distance in CSR. We incorporate it into the recent V2C-Flow model and demonstrate considerable improvements in previously neglected training consistency and reproducibility without harming reconstruction accuracy and topological correctness.

Subjects:

The dynamic of thermosensitive neuronal networks under the influence of external electric fields is explored, focusing on hybrid coupling models that incorporate both electrical and chemical synapses. Numerical simulations reveal a variety of complex behaviors, including coherent, incoherent, and chimera states, which are influenced by the frequency of the external field and the cell size. Specificaly chemical coupling is shown to enhances the appearance of a typical chimera states called traveling chimera states, while the external electric field modulates synchronization based on its frequency. Low-frequency fields induce localized synchronization, whereas high-frequency fields exert minimal influence. The study also investigates the role of intrinsic electric fields, represented by cell size, and their effect on both individual neuron activity and network dynamics. These findings enhance the understanding of how external fields control collective neuronal behavior and open up new possibilities for the modulation of neural activity.

The gold standard in the treatment of ischaemic stroke is set by evidence from randomized controlled trials, based on simple descriptions of presumptively homogeneous populations. Yet the manifest complexity of the brain's functional, connective, and vascular architectures introduces heterogeneities that violate the underlying statistical premisses, potentially leading to substantial errors at both individual and population levels. The counterfactual nature of interventional inference renders quantifying the impact of this defect difficult. Here we conduct a comprehensive series of semi-synthetic, biologically plausible, virtual interventional trials across 100M+ distinct simulations. We generate empirically grounded virtual trial data from large-scale meta-analytic connective, functional, genetic expression, and receptor distribution data, with high-resolution maps of 4K+ acute ischaemic lesions. Within each trial, we estimate treatment effects using models varying in complexity, in the presence of increasingly confounded outcomes and noisy treatment responses. Individualized prescriptions inferred from simple models, fitted to unconfounded data, were less accurate than those from complex models, fitted to confounded data. Our results indicate that complex modelling with richly represented lesion data is critical to individualized prescriptive inference in ischaemic stroke.

Synaptic Theory of Chunking in Working Memory

Working memory often appears to exceed its basic span by organizing items into compact representations called chunks. Chunking can be learned over time for familiar inputs; however, it can also arise spontaneously for novel stimuli. Such on-the-fly structuring is crucial for cognition, yet the underlying neural mechanism remains unclear. Here we introduce a synaptic theory of chunking, in which short-term synaptic plasticity enables the formation of chunk representations in working memory. We show that a specialized population of ``chunking neurons'' selectively controls groups of stimulus-responsive neurons, akin to gating. As a result, the network maintains and retrieves the stimuli in chunks, thereby exceeding the basic capacity. Moreover, we show that our model can dynamically construct hierarchical representations within working memory through hierarchical chunking. A consequence of this proposed mechanism is a new limit on the number of items that can be stored and subsequently retrieved from working memory, depending only on the basic working memory capacity when chunking is not invoked. Predictions from our model were confirmed by analyzing single-unit responses in epileptic patients and memory experiments with verbal material. Our work provides a novel conceptual and analytical framework for understanding how the brain organizes information in real time.

Life Finds A Way: Emergence of Cooperative Structures in Adaptive Threshold Networks

Subjects:
Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE); Social and Information Networks (cs.SI)
There has been a long debate on how new levels of organization have evolved. It might seem unlikely, as cooperation must prevail over competition. One well-studied example is the emergence of autocatalytic sets, which seem to be a prerequisite for the evolution of life. Using a simple model, we investigate how varying bias toward cooperation versus antagonism shapes network dynamics, revealing that higher-order organization emerges even amid pervasive antagonistic interactions. In general, we observe that a quantitative increase in the number of elements in a system leads to a qualitative transition.
We present a random threshold-directed network model that integrates node-specific traits with dynamic edge formation and node removal, simulating arbitrary levels of cooperation and competition. In our framework, intrinsic node values determine directed links through various threshold rules. Our model generates a multi-digraph with signed edges (reflecting support/antagonism, labeled ``help''/``harm''), which ultimately yields two parallel yet interdependent threshold graphs. Incorporating temporal growth and node turnover in our approach allows exploration of the evolution, adaptation, and potential collapse of communities and reveals phase transitions in both connectivity and resilience.
Our findings extend classical random threshold and Erdős-Rényi models, offering new insights into adaptive systems in biological and economic contexts, with emphasis on the application to Collective Affordance Sets. This framework should also be useful for making predictions that will be tested by ongoing experiments of microbial communities in soil.

Controllable Surface Diffusion Generative Model for Neurodevelopmental Trajectories

Subjects:
Neurons and Cognition (q-bio.NC); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)
Preterm birth disrupts the typical trajectory of cortical neurodevelopment, increasing the risk of cognitive and behavioral difficulties. However, outcomes vary widely, posing a significant challenge for early prediction. To address this, individualized simulation offers a promising solution by modeling subject-specific neurodevelopmental trajectories, enabling the identification of subtle deviations from normative patterns that might act as biomarkers of risk. While generative models have shown potential for simulating neurodevelopment, prior approaches often struggle to preserve subject-specific cortical folding patterns or to reproduce region-specific morphological variations. In this paper, we present a novel graph-diffusion network that supports controllable simulation of cortical maturation. Using cortical surface data from the developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP), we demonstrate that the model maintains subject-specific cortical morphology while modeling cortical maturation sufficiently well to fool an independently trained age regression network, achieving a prediction accuracy of $0.85 \pm 0.62$.

Subjects:
Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE); Computation (stat.CO)
A central question in evolutionary biology is how to quantitatively understand the dynamics of genetically diverse populations. Modeling the genotype distribution is challenging, as it ultimately requires tracking all correlations (or cumulants) among alleles at different loci. The quasi-linkage equilibrium (QLE) approximation simplifies this by assuming that correlations between alleles at different loci are weak -- i.e., low linkage disequilibrium -- allowing their dynamics to be modeled perturbatively. However, QLE breaks down under strong selection, significant epistatic interactions, or weak recombination. We extend the multilocus QLE framework to allow cumulants up to order $K$ to evolve dynamically, while higher-order cumulants ($>K$) are assumed to equilibrate rapidly. This extended QLE (exQLE) framework yields a general equation of motion for cumulants up to order $K$, which parallels the standard QLE dynamics (recovered when $K = 1$). In this formulation, cumulant dynamics are driven by the gradient of average fitness, mediated by a geometrically interpretable matrix that stems from competition among genotypes. Our analysis shows that the exQLE with $K=2$ accurately captures cumulant dynamics even when the fitness function includes higher-order (e.g., third- or fourth-order) epistatic interactions, capabilities that standard QLE lacks. We also applied the exQLE framework to infer fitness parameters from temporal sequence data. Overall, exQLE provides a systematic and interpretable approximation scheme, leveraging analytical cumulant dynamics and reducing complexity by progressively truncating higher-order cumulants.

Knowledge Graph Completion has been increasingly adopted as a useful method for helping address several tasks in biomedical research, such as drug repurposing or drug-target identification. To that end, a variety of datasets and Knowledge Graph Embedding models have been proposed over the years. However, little is known about the properties that render a dataset, and associated modelling choices, useful for a given task. Moreover, even though theoretical properties of Knowledge Graph Embedding models are well understood, their practical utility in this field remains controversial. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive investigation into the topological properties of publicly available biomedical Knowledge Graphs and establish links to the accuracy observed in real-world tasks. By releasing all model predictions and a new suite of analysis tools we invite the community to build upon our work and continue improving the understanding of these crucial applications.

Radial Basis Function Techniques for Neural Field Models on Surfaces

Comments:
25 pages, 8 figures
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA); Pattern Formation and Solitons (nlin.PS); Neurons and Cognition (q-bio.NC)
We present a numerical framework for solving neural field equations on surfaces using Radial Basis Function (RBF) interpolation and quadrature. Neural field models describe the evolution of macroscopic brain activity, but modeling studies often overlook the complex geometry of curved cortical domains. Traditional numerical methods, such as finite element or spectral methods, can be computationally expensive and challenging to implement on irregular domains. In contrast, RBF-based methods provide a flexible alternative by offering interpolation and quadrature schemes that efficiently handle arbitrary geometries with high-order accuracy. We first develop an RBF-based interpolatory projection framework for neural field models on general surfaces. Quadrature for both flat and curved domains are derived in detail, ensuring high-order accuracy and stability as they depend on RBF hyperparameters (basis functions, augmenting polynomials, and stencil size). Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the convergence of our method, highlighting its advantages over traditional approaches in terms of flexibility and accuracy. We conclude with an exposition of numerical simulations of spatiotemporal activity on complex surfaces, illustrating the method's ability to capture complex wave propagation patterns.
