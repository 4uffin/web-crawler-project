Title:
Reinforcement Learning for Quantum Network Control with Application-Driven Objectives
Guo Xian Yau, Alexandra Burushkina, Francisco Ferreira da Silva, Subhransu Maji, Philip S. Thomas, Gayane Vardoyan
Subjects:
Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
Optimized control of quantum networks is essential for enabling distributed quantum applications with strict performance requirements. In near-term architectures with constrained hardware, effective control may determine the feasibility of deploying such applications. Because quantum network dynamics are suitable for being modeled as a Markov decision process, dynamic programming and reinforcement learning (RL) offer promising tools for optimizing control strategies. However, key quantum network performance measures -- such as secret key rate in quantum key distribution -- often involve a non-linear relationship, with interdependent variables that describe quantum state quality and generation rate. Such objectives are not easily captured by standard RL approaches based on additive rewards. We propose a novel RL framework that directly optimizes non-linear, differentiable objective functions, while also accounting for uncertainties introduced by classical communication delays. We evaluate this framework in the context of entanglement distillation between two quantum network nodes equipped with multiplexing capability, and find that, in certain parameter regimes, it discovers policies that outperform heuristic baselines. Our work comprises the first step towards non-linear objective function optimization in quantum networks with RL, opening a path towards more advanced use cases.

Boosting Sparsity in Graph Decompositions with QAOA Sampling

Subjects:
Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
We study the problem of decomposing a graph into a weighted sum of a small number of graph matchings. This problem arises in network resource allocation problems such as peer-to-peer energy exchange, and it is challenging to solve with current classical algorithms even for small instances. To address this problem, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm, E-FCFW, based on the Fully-Corrective Frank-Wolfe (FCFW) algorithm. In particular, E-FCFW extends FCFW by incorporating a matching-sampling subroutine that can be carried out classically or with a quantum approach. We show how to design such a subroutine using QAOA, which aims at solving a constrained discrete optimisation problem approximately to obtain solution-variety. We benchmark our approach on complete, bipartite, and heavy-hex graphs, conducting experiments using the Qiskit Aer state-vector simulator (9-25 qubits), the Qiskit Aer MPS simulator (52-76 qubits) and on IBM Kingston (52-111 qubits), demonstrating performance at a utility-scale quantum hardware level. Our results show that E-FCFW with QAOA consistently yields sparser decompositions (mean and median) than the other methods (random sampling and simulated annealing) for small complete and bipartite graphs. For large heavy-hex graphs with 50 and 70 nodes, E-FCFW with QAOA also outperforms the other methods in terms of approximation error. Our findings highlight a promising role for quantum subroutines in classical algorithms.

Nonclassical Driven-Dissipative Dynamics in Collective Quantum Optics
Alejandro Vivas-Viaña

PhD Thesis, 311 pages, 107 figures
Subjects:
Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Optics (physics.optics)
Reduced abstract. This Thesis explores emergent cooperative phenomena in collective light-matter systems. We study ensembles of interacting quantum emitters coherently driven by a laser field and coupled to photonic structures, focusing on the hybrid description of emitters dressed by light. The interplay among quantum emitters, coherent driving, and photonic environments reveals a rich landscape of cooperative effects. While single-emitter dressing has been widely studied, we address collective phenomena in two non-identical emitters modelled as two-level systems. Strong interaction forms a dimer exhibiting superradiant and subradiant states, with two-photon resonances directly connecting ground and doubly excited states. This nonlinear process, central to the Thesis, enables new regimes of cooperative light-matter physics. Analytical studies show how interactions reshape observables such as emission intensity, photon statistics, and spectra, offering implications for quantum metrology. The sensitivity of two-photon processes to emitter distance and driving strength enables high-precision sensing and sub-wavelength imaging. Unexpectedly, we find that off-resonant virtual states may gain population through dissipation, redefining their role in open systems. To capture this, we develop a hierarchical adiabatic elimination method for metastable dynamics. We also analyze entanglement in emitters coupled to a lossy cavity, identifying five mechanisms, including the frequency-resolved Purcell effect introduced here. This selective enhancement stabilizes cooperative states and enables scalable entanglement. Our models, tailored to solid-state platforms such as quantum dots and molecular aggregates, address challenges like inhomogeneous broadening and decoherence, demonstrating the feasibility of harnessing cooperative light-matter effects for quantum technologies.

A Realist Approach to Quantum Individuality: Against the "Received" and "Alternative" Views
Christian de Ronde, Ivan Klarreich
Comments:
19 pages
Subjects:
Quantum Physics (quant-ph); History and Philosophy of Physics (physics.hist-ph)
In this work we address the contemporary debate about quantum individuality expressed as an opposition between those who, like Décio Krause, defend the reference of the theory to "non-individual particles", and those like Dennis Dieks, who propose instead to preserve the notion of "classical particle" as commonly applied by contemporary physicists. We will argue that these viewpoints rather than truly opposed share a common methodology which has helped to reinforce the doctrine of classical concepts that was imposed by Bohr and Dirac within the "standard" formulation --which remains the orthodox physical account of the theory of quanta. We will also discuss a recently proposed relativist yet objective relational account of quantum individuality [25] which, going back to Einstein's methodological approach, opens the doors to a completely new, truly realist understanding of quantum individuality.

Stabilizer-Shannon Renyi Equivalence: Exact Results for Quantum Critical Chains
M. A. Rajabpour
Comments:
6+3 pages
Subjects:
Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)
Shannon-Renyi and stabilizer entropies are key diagnostics of structure, non-stabilizerness, phase transitions, and universality in quantum many-body states. We establish an exact correspondence for quadratic fermions: for any nondegenerate Gaussian eigenstate, the stabilizer Renyi entropy equals the Shannon-Renyi entropy of a number-conserving free-fermion eigenstate on a doubled system, evaluated in the computational basis. Specializing to the transverse-field Ising (TFI) chain, the TFI ground state stabilizer entropies maps to the Shannon-Renyi entropies of the XX-chain ground state of length $2L$. Building on this correspondence, together with other exact identities we prove, closed expressions for the stabilizer entropy at indices $\alpha=\frac{1}{2},2,4$ for a broad class of critical closed free-fermion systems were derived. Each of these can be written with respect to the universal functions of the TFI chain. We further obtain conformal-field-theory scaling laws for the stabilizer entropy under both periodic and open boundaries at arbitrary Renyi index for these critical systems.

Parameter estimation with uncertainty quantification from continuous measurement data using neural network ensembles
Amanuel Anteneh
Subjects:
Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Machine Learning (cs.LG)
We show that ensembles of deep neural networks, called deep ensembles, can be used to perform quantum parameter estimation while also providing a means for quantifying uncertainty in parameter estimates, which is a key advantage of using Bayesian inference for parameter estimation. These models are shown to be more robust to noise in the measurement results used to perform the parameter estimation as well as noise in the data used to train them. We also show that much less data is needed to achieve comparable performance to Bayesian inference based estimation, which is known to reach the ultimate precision limit as more data is collected, than was used in previous proposals.

With rapid progress being made in the development of platforms for quantum computation, there has been considerable interest in whether present-day and near-term devices can be used to solve problems of relevance. A commonly cited application area is the domain of quantum chemistry. While most experimental demonstrations of quantum chemical calculations on quantum devices have focused on the ground-state electronic energy of the system, other properties of the ground-state, such as the electric dipole moment, are also of interest. Here we employ the quantum computed moments (QCM) method, based on the Lanczos cluster expansion, to estimate the dipole moment of the water molecule on an IBM Quantum superconducting quantum device. The noise-mitigated results agree with full configuration interaction (FCI) calculations to within 0.03 $\pm$ 0.007 debye (2% $\pm$ 0.5%), compared to direct expectation value determination (i.e. VQE) with errors on the order of 0.07 debye (5%), even when the VQE calculation is performed without noise. This demonstrates that moments-based energy estimation techniques can be adapted to noise-robust evaluation of non-energetic ground-state properties of chemical systems.

Subjects:
Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall); Biological Physics (physics.bio-ph)
The controlled assembly of solid-state spins with nanoscale spatial precision is an outstanding challenge for quantum technology. Here, we combine DNA-based patterning with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) ensemble quantum sensors in diamond to form and sense programmable 2D arrays of spins. We use DNA origami to control the spacing of chelated Gd$^{3+}$ spins, as verified by the observed linear relationship between proximal NVs' relaxation rate, $1/T_1$, and the engineered number of Gd$^{3+}$ spins per origami unit. We further show that DNA origami provides a robust way of functionalizing the diamond surface with spins as it preserves the charge state and spin coherence of proximal, shallow NV centers. Our work enables the formation and interrogation of ordered, strongly interacting spin networks with applications in quantum sensing and quantum simulation. We quantitatively discuss the prospects of entanglement-enhanced metrology and high-throughput proteomics.

Quantum-Assisted Recursive Algorithm for Solving the Exact Cover Problem
Xiao-Hui Ni, Jia-Cheng Fan, Ling-Xiao Li, Zi-Wen Huang, Su-Juan Qin, Bing-Jie Xu, Wei-Huang, Fei Gao
Subjects:
Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
The exact cover problem is an NP-complete problem with broad applications. Studies show that although applying the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) to this problem can yield improved solution quality with deeper circuit depth, it can limit the algorithm's applicability on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. To improve solution quality at shallow depth, we propose a Quantum-Assisted Recursive Algorithm (QARA) for solving the exact cover problem. QARA addresses the problem by alternately applying classical and quantum pruning. Classical pruning is a repeatable pre-processing step to simplify the problem. When the classical pruning cannot promote the problem simplification, quantum pruning is invoked. During quantum pruning, QARA extracts information from the QAOA's output state to identify the subset with the strongest selection bias. This subset is then used to prune the problem based on our problem-tailored reduction rules. Furthermore, QARA incorporates a local verification and rollback mechanism to assistively judge the effectiveness of the quantum simplification. After quantum pruning, classical pruning is applied again to the reduced problem if the remaining subsets and element set are not null. This alternating process repeats until the original problem is fully resolved. In our numerical simulations, we evaluate the performance of QARA at one-layer depth on 140 instances with subset sizes ranging from 8 to 20. Numerical results show that the probability of QARA in finding an exact solution is approximately 60\% higher than that of both QAOA and Recursive QAOA, highlighting its efficiency.

Simulating and Learning Quantum Evolution: A CTQW-ML Framework
Rachana Soni, Navneet Pratap Singh
Subjects:
Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
We present an approach to simulate the Schrödinger equation through continuous time quantum walks. The CTQW-based simulation applies unitary evolution driven by a quantum walk to generate probability amplitude distributions at various time steps. Additionally, we implemented a supervised neural network model to evaluate the effectiveness of data-driven techniques. The model learns to predict the squared modulus of the wavefunction given spatial and temporal coordinates. A comparative analysis demonstrates that the ML model can reproduce the qualitative structure and temporal progression of the quantum system with high accuracy. This study provides the synergy between quantum walk-based simulation and machine learning for solving quantum dynamical equations.

Hermitian vs non-Hermitian quantum thermometry
Anass Hminat, Abdallah Slaoui, Rachid Ahl Laamara, Mourad Telmini
Subjects:
Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
We investigate the dephasing dynamics of a qubit as an effective mechanism for estimating the temperature of its surrounding environment for different symmetrizes. Our approach is fundamentally quantum, leveraging the qubit's susceptibility to decoherence without necessitating thermal equilibrium with the system under study. We also examine how symmetry properties affect the accuracy of information retrieval and the robustness of quantum information storage in such systems, highlighting their potential advantages in mitigating decoherence effects. The optimization of quantum Fisher information is performed with respect to both the interaction duration and the environmental temperature, focusing on Ohmic-like spectral density environments. Furthermore, we explicitly identify the optimal qubit measurement that attains the quantum Cramer-Rao bound for precision. Our findings reveal that optimal estimation arises from a complex interplay between the qubit's dephasing dynamics and the Ohmic characteristics of the environment with a particular focus on non-Hermitian systems that exhibit enhanced resilience to decoherence. Notably, optimal estimation does not occur when the qubit reaches a stationary state nor under conditions of complete dephasing.

The efficacy of a communication network hinges upon both its physical architecture and the protocols that are employed within it. In the context of quantum communications, there exists a fundamental rate-loss tradeoff for point-to-point quantum channels such that the rate for distributing entanglement, secret keys, or quantum states decays exponentially with respect to transmission distance. Quantum networks are the solution to overcome point-to-point limitations, but they simultaneously invite a challenging open question: How should quantum networks be designed to effectively and efficiently guarantee high rates? Now that performance and physical topology are inexorably linked, this question is not easy, but the answer is essential for a future quantum internet to be successful. In this work, we offer crucial insight into this open question for complex optical-fiber quantum networks. Using realistic descriptions of quantum networks via random network models and practical end-to-end routing protocols, we reveal critical phenomena associated with large-scale quantum networks. Our work reveals the weaknesses of applying single-path routing protocols within quantum networks, observing an inability to achieve reliable rates over long distances. Adapting novel algorithms for multi-path routing, we employ an efficient and practical multi-path routing algorithm capable of boosting performance while minimizing costly quantum resources.

Erasing Classical Memory with Quantum Fluctuations: Shannon Information Entropy of Reverse Quantum Annealing

Subjects:

Quantum annealers can provide non-local optimization by tunneling between states in a process that ideally eliminates memory of the initial configuration. We study the crossover between memory loss and retention due to quantum fluctuations, in a transverse Ising model on odd numbered antiferromagnetic rings of thousands of spins with periodic boundary conditions, by performing reverse quantum annealing experiments on three programmable superconducting flux qubit quantum annealers. After initializing the spins to contain a single domain wall, we then expose it to quantum fluctuations by turning on the transverse Zeeman energy. We characterize the crossover between memory retention at low transverse field, and memory loss at high transverse field by extracting the Shannon information entropy of magnetic domain wall distributions. We demonstrate a clear crossover in memory retention, and its dependence on hardware platform and simulation time. Our approach establishes a general probe of the interplay between quantum fluctuations and memory.

Quasiprobability representations are well-established tools in quantum information science, with applications ranging from the classical simulability of quantum computation to quantum process tomography, quantum error correction, and quantum sensing. While traditional quasiprobability representations typically employ real-valued distributions, recent developments highlight the usefulness of complex-valued ones -- most notably, via the family of Kirkwood--Dirac quasiprobability distributions. Building on the framework of Schmid et al. [Quantum 8, 1283 (2024)], we extend the analysis to encompass complex-valued quasiprobability representations that need not preserve the identity channel. Additionally, we also extend previous results to consider mappings towards infinite-dimensional spaces. We show that, for each system, every such representation can be expressed as the composition of two maps that are completely characterized by their action on states and on the identity (equivalently, on effects) for that system. Our results apply to all complex-valued quasiprobability representations of any finite-dimensional, tomographically-local generalized probabilistic theory, with finite-dimensional quantum theory serving as a paradigmatic example. In the quantum case, the maps' action on states and effects corresponds to choices of frames and dual frames for the representation. This work offers a unified mathematical framework for analyzing complex-valued quasiprobability representations in generalized probabilistic theories.

Collisional model with dissipative and dephasing baths: Nonadditive effects at strong coupling
Alessandro Prositto, Carlos Ramon-Escandell, Dvira Segal
Subjects:
Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
The repeated interaction model provides a framework for emulating and analyzing the dynamics of open quantum systems. We explore here the dynamics generated by this protocol in a system that is simultaneously coupled to two baths through noncommuting system operators. One bath is made to couple to nondiagonal elements of the system, thus it induces dissipative dynamics, while the other couples to diagonal elements, and by itself it generates pure dephasing. By solving the problem analytically exactly, we show that when both baths act concurrently, a strong system-bath coupling gives rise to nonadditive effects in the dynamics. A prominent signature of this nonadditivity is the characteristic {\it slowing down} of population relaxation, driven by the influence of the dephasing bath. Beyond dynamics, we investigate the thermodynamic behavior of the model. Previous studies, using quantum master equations, showed that strong system-bath coupling created bath-cooperativity in this model, allowing heat exchange to the dephasing (diagonally coupled) bath. We find instead that, under the repeated interaction scheme, heat flows exclusively to the dissipative bath (coupled through nondiagonal elements). Our results highlight the need for a deeper understanding of the types of open quantum system dynamics and steady-state phenomena that emerge within the repeated interaction framework and the relation of this protocol to other common open quantum system techniques.

V-ZOR: Enabling Verifiable Cross-Blockchain Communication via Quantum-Driven ZKP Oracle Relays

Cross-chain bridges and oracle DAOs represent some of the most vulnerable components of decentralized systems, with more than $2.8 billion lost due to trust failures, opaque validation behavior, and weak incentives. Current oracle designs are based on multisigs, optimistic assumptions, or centralized aggregation, exposing them to attacks and delays. Moreover, predictable committee selection enables manipulation, which threatens data integrity across chains. We propose V-ZOR, a verifiable oracle relay that integrates zero-knowledge proofs, quantum-grade randomness, and cross-chain restaking to mitigate these risks. Each oracle packet includes a Halo 2 proof verifying that the reported data was correctly aggregated using a deterministic median. To prevent committee manipulation, VZOR reseeds its VRF using auditable quantum entropy, ensuring unpredictable and secure selection of reporters. Reporters stake once on a shared restaking hub; any connected chain can submit a fraud proof to trigger slashing, removing the need for multisigs or optimistic assumptions. A prototype in Sepolia and Scroll achieves sub-300k gas verification, one-block latency, and a 10x increase in collusion cost. V-ZOR demonstrates that combining ZK attestation with quantum-randomized restaking enables a trust-minimized, high-performance oracle layer for cross-chain DeFi.

Bound states and the collective dynamics of Distant Quantum Emitters coupled to a chiral waveguide
Meng Qian Wu, Ge Sun, Jing Lu, Lan Zhou
Subjects:
Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
We consider two two-level quantum emitters (QEs) with separations on the order of the wavelength which are chirally coupled to a one-dimensional (1D) waveguide, and the electromagnetic field of the 1D waveguide has a direction-dependent velocity, which produces two field propagation phases on the dynamics of QEs. Their spontaneous process is examined for QEs having unequal emission rates to the waveguide. It is found that radiation could be enhanced for both QEs, inhibited for both QEs, enhanced for one while inhibited for the other, completely suppressed for both QEs. In particular, the mechanism for radiation completely suppressed is the presence of a QE-photon bound state.

Quantum State Recovery via Direct Sum Formalism Without Measurement Outcomes
Taiga Suzuki, Masayuki Ohzeki
Comments:
7 pages
Subjects:
Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
This study proposes a new approach to quantum state recovery following measurement. Specifically, we introduce a special operation that transfers the probability amplitude of the quantum state into its orthogonal complement. This operation is followed by a measurement performed on this orthogonal subspace, enabling the undisturbed original quantum state to be regained. Remarkably, this recovery is achieved without dependence of the post-measurement operation on the measurement outcome, thus allowing the recovery without historical dependence. This constitutes a highly nontrivial phenomenon. From the operational perspective, as the no-cloning theorem forbids perfect and probabilistic cloning of arbitrary quantum states, and traditional post-measurement reversal methods typically rely on operations contingent on the measurement outcomes, it questions fundamental assumptions regarding the necessity of historic dependence. From an informational perspective, since this recovery method erases the information about the measurement outcome, it's intriguing that the information can be erased without accessing the measurement outcome. These results imply the operational and informational non-triviality formulated in a direct-sum Hilbert space framework.

Non-Hermitian Physics in Quantum Channels: Pseudo-Hermiticity, Spectrum Measurement and Application to Hamiltonian Parameter Estimation

Subjects:
Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
Quantum channels describe the most general evolutions of open quantum systems. The natural representation of a quantum channel, as a linear map on vectorized quantum states, is often a non-Hermitian matrix. Here we reveal the intriguing non-Hermitian physics in quantum channels and its application. We first demonstrate that the natural representation of any quantum channel is a pseudo-Hermitian matrix if it is diagonalizable with a discrete spectrum, due to its eigenvalues being either real or in complex conjugate pairs. Then we propose a general method to measure the channel spectrum by tracking the measurement statistics of a specific outcome in sequential quantum channels. We further construct and analyze a typical class of quantum channels, with each channel being a unitary channel on a target system followed by a weak-measurement channel induced by a Ramsey sequence of a probe qubit. We show that the spectrum measurement of such channels can be utilized for learning the free Hamiltonian generating the unitary channel of the target system. As practical examples, we numerically demonstrate that a probe spin qubit can accurately sense nuclear spin clusters for nanoscale nuclear magnetic resonance.

A Collaborative Framework for Quantum Optimisation and Quantum Neural Networks: Credit Feature Selection and Image Classification
JiaNing Long, Xuechen Liang
Subjects:
Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
This paper investigates the efficacy of quantum computing in two distinct machine learning tasks: feature selection for credit risk assessment and image classification for handwritten digit recognition. For the first task, we address the feature selection challenge of the German Credit Dataset by formulating it as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem, which is solved using quantum annealing to identify the optimal feature subset. Experimental results show that the resulting credit scoring model maintains high classification precision despite using a minimal number of features. For the second task, we focus on classifying handwritten digits 3 and 6 in the MNIST dataset using Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs). Through meticulous data preprocessing (downsampling, binarization), quantum encoding (FRQI and compressed FRQI), and the design of QNN architectures (CRADL and CRAML), we demonstrate that QNNs can effectively handle high-dimensional image data. Our findings highlight the potential of quantum computing in solving practical machine learning problems while emphasizing the need to balance resource expenditure and model efficacy.

Quantum computing is an emerging field in computer science that has seen considerable progress in recent years, especially in machine learning. By harnessing the principles of quantum physics, it can surpass the limitations of classical algorithms. However, variational quantum circuits (VQCs), which rely on adjustable parameters, often face the barren plateau phenomenon, hindering optimization. The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) is a recent concept in classical machine learning that has led to notable improvements in parameter efficiency for neural networks. It states that within a large network, a smaller, more efficient subnetwork, or ''winning ticket,'' can achieve comparable performance, potentially circumventing plateau challenges. In this work, we investigate whether this idea can apply to VQCs. We show that the weak LTH holds for VQCs, revealing winning tickets that retain just 26.0\% of the original parameters. For the strong LTH, where a pruning mask is learned without any training, we discovered a winning ticket in a binary VQC, achieving 100\% accuracy with only 45\% of the weights. These findings indicate that LTH may mitigate barren plateaus by reducing parameter counts while preserving performance, thus enhancing the efficiency of VQCs in quantum machine learning tasks.

We introduce U(1)-QHFPE, a non-Markovian and non-perturbative open quantum dynamics software package for solving quantum Fokker-Planck equations incorporating gauge fields within the Hierarchical Equations of Motion (HEOM) formalism. The framework rigorously preserves gauge invariance and rotational symmetry, enabling accurate simulations of transport phenomena such as the Aharonov-Bohm effect under strong system-bath coupling. In this regime, quantum entanglement between the system and bath emerges naturally. Demonstration programs include calculations of symmetric and antisymmetric correlation functions in Aharonov-Bohm ring geometries, showcasing the code's ability to resolve topological quantum interference in dissipative open systems.

Quantum Architecture Search for Solving Quantum Machine Learning Tasks

Quantum computing leverages quantum mechanics to address computational problems in ways that differ fundamentally from classical approaches. While current quantum hardware remains error-prone and limited in scale, Variational Quantum Circuits offer a noise-resilient framework suitable for today's devices. The performance of these circuits strongly depends on the underlying architecture of their parameterized quantum components. Identifying efficient, hardware-compatible quantum circuit architectures -- known as Quantum Architecture Search (QAS) -- is therefore essential. Manual QAS is complex and error-prone, motivating efforts to automate it. Among various automated strategies, Reinforcement Learning (RL) remains underexplored, particularly in Quantum Machine Learning contexts. This work introduces RL-QAS, a framework that applies RL to discover effective circuit architectures for classification tasks. We evaluate RL-QAS using the Iris and binary MNIST datasets. The agent autonomously discovers low-complexity circuit designs that achieve high test accuracy. Our results show that RL is a viable approach for automated architecture search in quantum machine learning. However, applying RL-QAS to more complex tasks will require further refinement of the search strategy and performance evaluation mechanisms.

Computation of observables and their gradients on near-term quantum hardware is a central aspect of any quantum algorithm. In this work, we first review standard approaches to the estimation of observables with and without quantum amplitude estimation for both cost functions and gradients, discuss sampling problems, and analyze variance propagation on quantum circuits with and with- out Linear Combination of Unitaries (LCU). Afterwards, we systematically analyze the standard approaches to gradient computation with LCU circuits. Finally, we develop a LCU gradient frame- work for the most general gradients based on n-qubit gates and for time-dependent quantum control gradient, analyze the convergence behaviour of the circuit estimators, and provide detailed circuit representations of both for near-term and fault-tolerant hardware.

Among the several available proofs, we focus on those by Petz and Uhlmann, which we reformulate within a unified, finite-dimensional operator-theoretic framework. In the first part, we examine Petz's strategy, identify a subtle flaw in his original use of Jensen's contractive operator inequality, and point out how it was corrected to restore the validity of his line of reasoning. In the second part, we develop Uhlmann's approach, which is based on interpolations of positive sesquilinear forms and applies automatically also to non-invertible density operators. By comparing these two approaches, we highlight their complementary strengths: Petz's method is more direct and clear, Uhlmann's is more abstract and general. Our treatment aims to clarify the mathematical structure underlying the monotonicity of relative entropy and to make these proofs more accessible to a broader audience interested in both the foundations and the applications of quantum information theory.

Hidden correlations in quantum jumps: A theory of individual trials
Hiroshi Ishikawa

Subjects:
Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
Quantum trajectory theories have not fully reconciled discrete quantum jumps with continuous unitary evolution. We address this challenge by developing a hidden variable formulation that reveals hidden correlations in individual trials. We represent jump sequences as logical propositions on energy eigenstate occupations, where logical variables describe their truth values and chain operators describe their probabilities. To circumvent established no-go theorems, we introduce a proposition selection rule that requires well-defined joint probabilities for a given density operator. This rule unifies compatibility criteria for quantum and hidden variable theories, eliminating incompatible propositions that lead to value assignment paradoxes. Unlike conventional criteria mandating operator commutativity, it permits propositions that become deterministic for specific initial conditions. This framework systematically captures deterministic relations in individual trials, including the exclusivity of state occupation implied by the observed jumps. This exclusivity, distinct from the Pauli exclusion principle, enables the formalization of a quantum version of Boolean logic as laws for quantum propositions. These assumptions circumvent Bell-type inequalities by prohibiting arithmetic operations between incompatible logical variables, while enabling classical descriptions within the complementarity. The resulting theory reconciles discrete jumps with continuous evolution, providing a direct description of individual trials while preserving standard probability predictions.

Diagnosing Quantum Circuits: Noise Robustness, Trainability, and Expressibility
Yuguo Shao, Zhengyu Chen, Zhaohui Wei, Zhengwei Liu
Subjects:
Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
Parameterized quantum circuits are central to near-term quantum algorithms, and serve as the foundation for many quantum machine learning frameworks, which should be robust to noise, maintain trainability, and exhibit sufficient expressibility. Here we introduce 2MC-OBPPP, a polynomial-time classical estimator that quantifies the three aforementioned diagnostics for a given parameterized quantum circuit. As a demonstration of the power of our approach, we show that moderate amplitude damping noise can reduce the severity of vanishing gradients, but at the cost of lowered expressibility. In particular, our approach can yield a spatiotemporal "noise-hotspot" map that pinpoints the most noise-sensitive qubits/gates in parameterized quantum circuits. Applying this map to a specific circuit, we show that implementing interventions on fewer than 2% of the qubits is sufficient to mitigate up to 90% of the errors. Therefore, 2MC-OBPPP is not only an efficient, hardware-independent tool for pre-execution circuit evaluation but also enables targeted strategies that significantly reduce the cost of noise suppression.

We study the geometric phase accumulated during non-adiabatic charging of different driven open quantum systems serving as quantum battery models. We provide a full numerical analysis of dy- namics under different type of noises typically reported in superconducting circuits implementations. We complement the study with analytic results derived in the limiting case of no noise (i.e. isolated systems). We compute the non-unitary geometric phase acquired by the quantum batteries during the transition and show that there is a direct relation between the accumulated geometric phase and the integral of the stored energy during the transition. Finally, we perform the same analysis on a bipartite quantum battery that relies on a dephased charger and found similar results. Our theoretical findings are within experimental reach using state-of-the-art techniques.

Directional Motional Control via Engineered Conical Intersections in Trapped Rydberg Ions

Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
We demonstrate coherent control of motional dynamics in trapped Rydberg ions engineered to exhibit a conical intersection between adiabatic potential-energy surfaces. Using quantum optimal control, an optimally shaped electric field drives the motional wave packet between prescribed spatial configurations on microsecond timescales. Localized nonadiabatic coupling breaks the symmetry of the dynamics and produces a directed trajectory: after only a few early passages through the conical intersection region, the packet proceeds toward the target with high fidelity. In contrast, in the Born-Oppenheimer limit, where such coupling is absent, the optimized control yields symmetric, multi-cycle oscillations rather than a comparably directed displacement. While both approaches reach the target at the chosen final time, the underlying trajectories are qualitatively different. This work demonstrates that engineered conical intersections can serve as a new control resource for directional motional dynamics, complementing pulse-shaping methods in trapped-ion systems. This directional motion of the ions, enabled by the conical intersection, is expected to have important applications for quantum information processing, where controlled motional states underpin high-fidelity gate operations and scalable architectures.

Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
Fault-tolerant quantum computing demands decoders that are fast, accurate, and adaptable to circuit structure and realistic noise. While machine learning (ML) decoders have demonstrated impressive performance for quantum memory, their use in algorithmic decoding - where logical gates create complex error correlations - remains limited. We introduce a modular attention-based neural decoder that learns gate-induced correlations and generalizes from training on random circuits to unseen multi-qubit algorithmic workloads. Our decoders achieve fast inference and logical error rates comparable to most-likely-error (MLE) decoders across varied circuit depths and qubit counts. Addressing realistic noise, we incorporate loss-resolving readout, yielding substantial gains when qubit loss is present. We further show that by tailoring the decoder to the structure of the algorithm and decoding only the relevant observables, we can simplify the decoder design without sacrificing accuracy. We validate our framework on multiple error correction codes - including surface codes and 2D color codes - and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance under circuit-level noise. Finally, we show that the use of attention offers interpretability by identifying the most relevant correlations being tracked by the decoder. Enabling experimental validation of deep-circuit fault-tolerant algorithms and architectures (Bluvstein et al., arXiv:2506.20661, 2025), these results establish neural decoders as practical, versatile, and high-performance tools for quantum computing.

Quantum Graph Attention Networks: Trainable Quantum Encoders for Inductive Graph Learning

Subjects:
Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Machine Learning (cs.LG)
We introduce Quantum Graph Attention Networks (QGATs) as trainable quantum encoders for inductive learning on graphs, extending the Quantum Graph Neural Networks (QGNN) framework. QGATs leverage parameterized quantum circuits to encode node features and neighborhood structures, with quantum attention mechanisms modulating the contribution of each neighbor via dynamically learned unitaries. This allows for expressive, locality-aware quantum representations that can generalize across unseen graph instances. We evaluate our approach on the QM9 dataset, targeting the prediction of various chemical properties. Our experiments compare classical and quantum graph neural networks-with and without attention layers-demonstrating that attention consistently improves performance in both paradigms. Notably, we observe that quantum attention yields increasing benefits as graph size grows, with QGATs significantly outperforming their non-attentive quantum counterparts on larger molecular graphs. Furthermore, for smaller graphs, QGATs achieve predictive accuracy comparable to classical GAT models, highlighting their viability as expressive quantum encoders. These results show the potential of quantum attention mechanisms to enhance the inductive capacity of QGNN in chemistry and beyond.

Hardware crosstalk in multi-tenant superconducting quantum computers constitutes a significant security threat, enabling adversaries to inject targeted errors across tenant boundaries. We present the first end-to-end framework for mapping physical pulse-level attacks to interpretable logical error channels, integrating density-matrix simulation, quantum process tomography (QPT), and a novel isometry-based circuit extraction method. Our pipeline reconstructs the complete induced error channel and fits an effective logical circuit model, revealing a fundamentally asymmetric attack mechanism: one adversarial qubit acts as a driver to set the induced logical rotation, while a second, the catalyst, refines the attack's coherence. Demonstrated on a linear three-qubit system, our approach shows that such attacks can significantly disrupt diverse quantum protocols, sometimes reducing accuracy to random guessing, while remaining effective and stealthy even under realistic hardware parameter variations. We further propose a protocol-level detection strategy based on observable attack signatures, showing that stealthy attacks can be exposed through targeted monitoring and providing a foundation for future defense-in-depth in quantum cloud platforms.

Quantum Functional Information through the Evolution of Random Circuits

Subjects:
Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
We introduce Quantum Functional Information (QFI), a new metric to quantify the
rarity and utility of quantum states and circuits. Unlike standard measures such as fidelity
or entropy, QFI captures the balance between functionality and rarity within the Hilbert
space. We validate QFI through two approaches: random circuit sampling and evolutionary
algorithms guided by fidelity or QFI objectives. Random sampling shows that states with
near-perfect fidelity are less informational than slightly suboptimal but rarer states, while
correlations reveal that high fidelity typically requires fewer gates and shallower circuits.
Evolutionary results demonstrate that fidelity-only optimization converges quickly but reduces
diversity and robustness, whereas QFI optimization sustains exploration, generates richer
structures, and favors robust circuits with high fidelity. These findings position QFI as
a practical and interpretable tool for circuit design, benchmarking, variational quantum
algorithms, and exploring emergent patterns in quantum systems.

As quantum processors begin operating as tightly coupled accelerators inside high-performance computing (HPC) facilities, dependable and reproducible behavior becomes a gating requirement for scientific and industrial workloads. We present a hardware-maturity probe that quantifies a device's reliability by testing whether it can repeatedly reproduce the provably global optima of single-layer Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) circuits. Using harmonic analysis, we derive closed-form upper bounds on the number of stationary points in the p=1 QAOA cost landscape for broad classes of combinatorial-optimization problems. These bounds yield an exhaustive yet low-overhead grid-sampling scheme with analytically verifiable outcomes. The probe integrates reliability-engineering notions like run-to-failure statistics, confidence-interval estimation, and reproducibility testing into a single, application-centric benchmark. Our framework supplies a standardized dependability metric for hybrid quantum-HPC (QHPC) workflows.

Estimation of an optical beam's transverse displacement is a canonical imaging problem fundamental to numerous optical imaging and sensing tasks. Quantum enhancements to the measurement precision in this problem have been studied extensively. However, previous studies have neither accounted for diffraction loss in full generality, nor have they addressed how to jointly optimize the spatial mode and the balance between squeezing and coherent amplitude. Here we show that, in the small-displacement limit, the seemingly intractable infinite-spatial-mode problem can be reduced to a compact three-mode interaction framework. We quantify the improvement afforded by an optimized single-spatial-mode Gaussian-state probe over the optimal classical laser probe, and show that a two-spatial-mode homodyne receiver is asymptotically optimal for the former in the limit of high probe energy. Our findings reveal a strategy for identifying quantum-optimal probes in the presence of generic multimode linear probe-target interaction and photon loss.

We investigate a three-dimensional subsystem under a time-dependent U(1) gauge field coupled to rotationally invariant environments. To capture the dynamic behavior of the subsystem under thermal excitations and dissipations, it is imperative to treat the bath in a non-Markovian and nonperturbative manner. This is because quantum noise is constrained by the uncertainty principle, which dictates the relationship between the noise correlation time and the amplitude of the energy fluctuation. To this end, we derive the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) incorporating the gauge field, enabling a rigorous investigation of the dynamics of the reduced subsystem. Transforming the HEOM into the Wigner representation yields quantum hierarchical Fokker-Planck equations [U(1)-QHFPE] with U(1) gauge fields. These equations incorporate vector fields into the damping operators while preserving both gauge invariance and rotational symmetry. To demonstrate the practical use of the formalism, the effects of a heat bath in the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) ring. Our investigation includes simulations of the equilibrium distribution, linear absorption spectra, and AB currents under thermal conditions. Within a rotationally invariant system-bath (RISB) model, we predict the emergence of a persistent current even in dissipative environments, provided the bath is non-Markovian and the temperature is sufficiently low. We also assessed the validity of the Caldeira-Leggett model in this context.

We introduce a transparent, encoding-agnostic framework for determining when the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) can achieve early quantum advantage. Our analysis shows this is unlikely on noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) hardware even in best case scenarios that use the most qubit-efficient direct encodings. Closed-form resource counts, combined with recent device benchmarks, yield three decisive go/no-go figures of merit: the quantum feasibility point and the qubit- and gate-feasibility lines, which place any CVRP instance on a single decision diagram. Contrasting a direct QUBO mapping with a space-efficient higher-order (HOBO) encoding reveals a large gap. Applied to early-advantage benchmarks such as Golden-5, our diagram shows that HOBO circuits require only 7,685 qubits, whereas comparable QUBO encodings still exceed 200,000 qubits. In addition to identifying candidate instances for early quantum advantage in CVRP, the framework provides a unifying go/no-go metric that ingests any CVRP encoding together with any hardware profile and highlights when quantum devices could challenge classical heuristics. Quantum advantage in CVRP would likely require innovative problem decomposition techniques.

Simulating out-of-equilibrium dynamics of quantum field theories in nature is challenging with classical methods, but is a promising application for quantum computers. Unfortunately, simulating interacting bosonic fields involves a high boson-to-qubit encoding overhead. Furthermore, when mapping to qubits, the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space of bosons is necessarily truncated, with truncation errors that grow with energy and time. A qubit-based quantum computer, augmented with an active bosonic register, and with qubit, bosonic, and mixed qubit-boson quantum gates, offers a more powerful platform for simulating bosonic theories. We demonstrate this capability experimentally in a hybrid analog-digital trapped-ion quantum computer, where qubits are encoded in the internal states of the ions, and the bosons in the ions' motional states. Specifically, we simulate nonequilibrium dynamics of a (1+1)-dimensional Yukawa model, a simplified model of interacting nucleons and pions, and measure fermion- and boson-occupation-state probabilities. These dynamics populate high bosonic-field excitations starting from an empty state, and the experimental results capture well such high-occupation states. This simulation approaches the regime where classical methods become challenging, bypasses the need for a large qubit overhead, and removes truncation errors. Our results, therefore, open the way to achieving demonstrable quantum advantage in qubit-boson quantum computing.

Classical State Detection Using Quantum State Tomography

Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
We present a model to detect a classical state mixed with an idler photon from a polarization-entangled pair. A weak coherent light with a well-defined polarization, matched in wavelength to the idler photon, is injected into the idler channel. Quantum state tomography is then performed on both the classically mixed idler photon and its entangled signal partner. The reconstructed state is modeled as a combination of an $X-$quantum state and a classical-quantum (CQ) state. In this framework, the weak coherent light acts as a measurement apparatus performing a local polarization measurement on the idler channel, thereby inducing a classical state. The density matrix of the classical state is identified via algorithmic analysis of the diagonal and off-diagonal elements of the reconstructed density matrix. This approach could advance techniques for classical-quantum coexistence in networking applications$\,-\,$such as quantum wrapping$\,-\,$as well as future quantum key distribution protocols based on the coexistence of weak coherent states and entangled photon states.

A pivotal task for quantum computing is to speed up solving problems that are both classically intractable and practically valuable. Among these, combinatorial optimization problems have attracted tremendous attention due to their broad applicability and natural fitness to Ising Hamiltonians. Here we propose a quantum sampling strategy, based on which we design an algorithm for accelerating solving the ground states of Ising model, a class of NP-hard problems in combinatorial optimization. The algorithm employs a hybrid quantum-classical workflow, with a shallow-circuit quantum sampling subroutine dedicated to navigating the energy landscape. Using up to 104 superconducting qubits, we demonstrate that this algorithm outputs favorable solutions against even a highly-optimized classical simulated annealing (SA) algorithm. Furthermore, we illustrate the path toward quantum speedup based on the time-to-solution metric against SA running on a single-core CPU with just 100 qubits. Our results indicate a promising alternative to classical heuristics for combinatorial optimization, a paradigm where quantum advantage might become possible on near-term superconducting quantum processors with thousands of qubits and without the assistance of error correction.

Decoherence-free subspace (DFS) provides a crucial mechanism for passive error mitigation in quantum computation by encoding information within symmetry-protected subspaces of the Hilbert space, which are immune from collective decoherence. Constructing a complete set of orthogonal basis states for the DFS is essential to realize fault-tolerant quantum computation by using the DFS codes. However, existing methods for preparing these basis states are often non-scalable, platform-specific, or yield mixed states. Here, we propose a deterministic approach to prepare pure, orthogonal and complete DFS basis states for systems of arbitrary size composed of qubits. Our method employs projective measurements and quantum circuits with single-qubit, two-qubit and Toffoli gates. We provide a rigorous resource cost analysis both mathematically and numerically. Meanwhile, we demonstrate the realizability of our method on NISQ devices by discussing how to implement our method on a superconducting chip. The proposed method offers a universal solution for preparing the DFS basis states across diverse quantum computing platforms and system sizes, which is realizable in the NISQ era.

Weinvestigate the generation of antibunching photons and photon pairs in a two-atom cavity QED

Conversely, at the antiblockade excitation frequency, quantum Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate

Scanning nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center electrometry has shown potential for quantitative quantum imaging of electric fields at the nanoscale. However, achieving nanoscale spatial resolution remains a challenge since employing gradiometry to overcome electrostatic screening causes resolution-limiting trade-offs including the averaging effect and the sensor-sample proximity. Here, we demonstrate a scanning NV center protocol that achieves an enhanced spatial resolution of approximately 10 nm. We develop an axially symmetric probe with a sub-nanometer oscillating amplitude, which simultaneously provides robust intermittent-contact mode feedback and ensures close engagement between the diamond tip and the sample. As an example, we experimentally demonstrate a 10 nm spatial resolution on ferroelectric lithium niobate. Scanning NV center electrometry with this resolution can directly resolve the nanoscale polar textures and dynamics of emerging ferroelectrics, which commonly arise on the scale of tens of nanometers.

We investigate the trade-off between vacuum insensitivity and sensitivity to excitations in finite-size detectors, taking measurement locality as a fundamental constraint. We derive an upper bound on the detectability of vacuum excitation, given a small but nonzero probability of false positives in the vacuum state. The result is independent of the specific details of the measurement or the underlying physical mechanisms of the detector and relies only on the assumption of locality. Experimental confirmation or violation of the inequality would provide a test of the axioms of algebraic quantum field theory, offer new insights into the measurement problem in relativistic quantum physics, and establish a fundamental technological limit in local particle detection.

Bohmian mechanics, also referred to as the de Broglie-Bohm pilot-wave theory, represents a deterministic and nonlocal interpretation of quantum mechanics. Since its origination in 1927, despite many attempts, reconciling it with relativistic theory and verification of its relativistic effects have remained elusive. Here, we report a direct observation of relativistic characteristics of Bohmian mechanics. We reconstruct the relativistic Bohmian trajectories of single photons utilizing weak measurement techniques in a double-slit interferometer, unveiling a fundamental aspect of relativistic Bohmian mechanics. We investigate the effective squared mass density of single photons, revealing its negative values in the destructive regions -- a phenomenon directly links to the tachyonic behavior in relativistic Bohmian mechanics. The continuity equations given by both the Klein-Gordon equation and Schrödinger's equation are experimentally examined. Our result indicates that within the framework of relativity, the conservation of energy holds true, whereas the conservation of particle number for a free scalar field no longer holds. The emergence of previously unobserved phenomena in the extensively studied double-slit experiment are enabled by Bohmian mechanics, while conversely, these experimental outcomes offer unambiguous evidence of the long-sought-after relativistic features within Bohmian mechanics.

For quantum computers based on photonics, one main problem is the synthesis of a photonic circuit that emulates quantum computing gates. The problem requires using photonic components to build a circuit that act like a quantum computing gate with some probability of success. This involves not only finding a circuit that can correctly act like a quantum gate, but also optimizing the probability of success. Whilst many approaches have been given in the past and applied to specific gates, they often lack ease of reusability. We present a tool that uses dReal, a {\delta}-weakening SMT solver, to find such photonic circuits, optimize the likelihood of occurring, and provide some guarantee that the result is optimal. We demonstrate the usage of our tool by recreating known results in the literature, extending upon them, and presenting new results for Givens rotation gates.

Camera-based wide-field quantum noise spectroscopy (QNS) with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center spins in diamond can be used to extract DC and AC magnetic field noise with sub-micrometer spatial resolution, but its realization is currently limited by the conflict between the optimal optical spin readout time (normally below one microsecond) and the minimal camera exposure time (normally tens of microsecond). In the present article, we demonstrate fully coherent control of NV center spins via Rabi oscillation, Ramsey, Hahn echo and relaxometry experiments, i.e. the core of QNS, with a home-built camera-based setup, and achieve an unexpectedly high contrast of 12% with an optical spin readout time of 500 microseconds. We explain the absence of the above conflict in our system with the optical spin readout mechanism under weak laser illumination, where spin-lattice relaxation and weak optical pumping result in a rather slow reduction of contrast with increasing integration time. The revealed mechanism is instructive for the construction of the wide-field QNS with a sCMOS or EMCCD camera, and its application in the studies of magnetic material or superconducting material.

A significant performance inhibitor of free-space continuous variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) is turbulence, which gives rise to wavefront phase and amplitude aberrations. We demonstrate that in a turbulent channel, during coherent state transmissions from a continuous-wave laser, that the interferometric visibility between the local oscillator (LO) and quantum signal decreases. A solution to this is incorporating adaptive optics at the receiver to correct phase and amplitude aberrations in the wavefronts of the received quantum signal. We demonstrate the increased interferometric visibility and decrease in its fluctuations in a 60 cm and 30 m turbulent channel when using adaptive optics through channel characterisation. In an ideal CVQKD system, we show that this leads to more precise and larger positive secret key rates, improving the performance of free-space CVQKD in turbulent channels.

Instead of the conventional construction of symmetric and antisymmetric states by abruptly projecting with the symmetrizer or antisymmetrizer, this paper investigates rapid but continuous symmetrization via environment-induced decoherence. Density operators are transformed to a symmetric observable via a semigroup map obtained from an interacting Hamiltonian. Likewise, a completely positive dynamical map transforms a completely asymmetric state to either a symmetric or antisymmetric state. The theory is applied to analyze a collision between two identical particles having arbitrary spin and negligible spin interactions. We discuss extensions to larger domains via dynamical maps that are not completely positive.

Fast, high-fidelity, and low back-action readout plays a crucial role in the advancement of quantum error correction (QEC). Here, we demonstrate high-performance multiplexed readout of superconducting qubits using a tunable broadband Purcell filter, effectively resolving the fundamental trade-off between measurement speed and photon-noise-induced dephasing. By dynamically tuning the filter parameters, we suppress photon-noise-induced dephasing by a factor of 7 in idle status, while enabling rapid, high-fidelity readout in measurement status. We achieve 99.6\% single-shot readout fidelity with 100~ns readout pulse, limited primarily by relaxation errors during readout. Using a multilevel readout protocol, we further attain 99.9\% fidelity in 50~ns. Simultaneous readout of three qubits using 100~ns pulses achieves an average fidelity of 99.5\% with low crosstalk. Additionally, the readout exhibits high quantum-nondemolition (QND) performance: 99.4\% fidelity over repeated measurements and a low leakage rate below 0.1\%. Building on the tunable broadband filter, we further propose a scalable readout scheme for surface code QEC with enhanced multiplexing capability, offering a promising solution for fast and scalable QEC.

Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
A stochastic Schrödinger equation is presented to describe simultaneous continuous measurement of the position and momentum of a non-relativistic particle. The equation is solved to yield a state localised in position and momentum contingent on the uncertainty principle. The state is understood as that to which the particle tends after a period of continuous measurement. The solution takes the form of a wave packet of fixed Gaussian shape whose centre undergoes random motion in phase space. It is shown to be locally stable.

Spin ensembles are central to quantum science, from frequency standards and fundamental physics searches to magnetic resonance spectroscopy and quantum sensing. Their performance is ultimately constrained by spin projection noise, yet solid-state implementations have so far been limited by much larger photon shot noise. Here we demonstrate a direct, quantum non-demolition readout of a mesoscopic ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond that surpasses the photon shot-noise limit and approaches the intrinsic spin projection noise. By stabilizing the $^{14}$N nuclear spin bath at high magnetic fields and employing repetitive nuclear-assisted spin readout, we achieve a noise reduction of 3.8 dB below the thermal projection noise level. This enables direct access to the intrinsic fluctuations of the spin ensemble, allowing us to directly observe the signatures of correlated spin states. Our results establish projection noise-limited readout as a practical tool for solid-state quantum sensors, opening pathways to quantum-enhanced metrology, direct detection of many-body correlations, and the implementation of spin squeezing in mesoscopic solid-state ensembles.

Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)
Open quantum systems can be approximately described by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians (NHHs) and Lindbladians. The two approaches differ by quantum jump terms corresponding to a measurement of the system by its environment. We analyze the emergence of exceptional points (EPs) in NHHs and Lindbladians. In particular, we show how EPs in NHHs relate to a novel type of EPs -- multi-block EPs -- in the non-Hermitian Liouvillian, i.e. the Lindbladian in absence of quantum jump terms. We further analyze how quantum jump terms modify the multi-block structure. To illustrate our general findings, we present two prime examples: qubits and qutrits coupled to additional ground state levels that serves as sinks of the population. In those examples, we can navigate through the EP block structure by a variation of physical parameters. We analyze how the dynamics of the population of the states is affected by the order of the EPs. Additionally, we demonstrate that the quantum geometric tensor serves as a sensitive indicator of EPs of different kinds.

Optimizing Quantum Photonic Integrated Circuits using Differentiable Tensor Networks

Subjects:
Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
Recent reports of large photonic nonlinearities in integrated photonic devices, using the strong excitonic light-matter coupling in semiconductors, necessitate a tailored design framework for quantum processing in the limit of low photon occupation. We present a gradient-based optimization method for quantum photonic integrated circuits, which are composed of nonlinear unitary coupling gates and stochastic, nonunitary components for sampling the photonic losses. As core of our method, differentiable tensor-networks are leveraged, which are accurate in the regime of low photonic occupation and modest intermode entanglement. After characterizing the circuit gate architecture with field simulations of GaAs-based samples, we demonstrate the applicability of our method by optimizing quantum photonic circuits for two key use cases: integrated designs for quantum optical state preparation and tailored optimal readout for quantum phase sensing.

Remote entanglement between independent and widely separated qubits is an essential quantum phenomenon and a critical resource for quantum information applications. Generating entanglement between qubits at arbitrary distances requires the distribution of propagating quantum states. This necessity raises the intriguing question whether the entanglement can be stabilized indefinitely, instead of only periodically reestablished after decay. Here, we report autonomous stabilization of entanglement between two separate superconducting-qubit devices. Combining nonreciprocal waveguide coupling and local driving, we experimentally realize distance-independent steady-state remote entanglement in a coherent quantum-absorber scheme. Enhancing this scheme with a new approach for overcoming inevitable disorder, we achieve a concurrence approaching 0.5. Our results set the stage for on-demand entanglement delivery in quantum processors and networks, and for protecting multipartite entanglement in open systems.

Quantum dot single-photon sources are promising for quantum communication. Yet, the most advanced devices operate near 900 nm, where standard single-mode fibers experience significant losses. We address this by employing a hollow-core fiber engineered for low-loss transmission at quantum dot wavelengths, with measured loss of 0.65 dB/km and potentially as low as 0.12 dB/km near 934 nm. The fiber also supports strong classical signals at 1550 nm without adding Raman noise. Using this platform, we transmit all four BB84 polarization states from an InAs quantum dot over 340 m with 0.1% QBER, preserving single-photon purity and indistinguishability even in the presence of a strong classical signal. These results highlight how tailored transmission media enable quantum networks beyond the limits of standard telecom fibers.

We present a continuous non-local model that faithfully replicates the rich topological and spectral features of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. Remarkably, our model shares the SSH models bulk energy spectrum, eigenstates, and Zak phase, hallmarks of its topological character, while introducing a tunable length-scale a quantifying non-locality. This parameter allows for a controlled interpolation between non-local and local regimes. Furthermore, for a specific value of a the exact spectral equivalence to the discrete SSH model is established. Distinct from previous continuous analogues based on Schrödinger or Dirac-type Hamiltonians, our approach maintains chiral symmetry, does not require an external potential and features periodic energy bands. On finite domains, the model supports a flat band with zero energy formed by a countable infinite set of exponentially localized zero-energy edge states of topological origin. Beyond SSH, our method lays the foundation for constructing non-local, continuous analogues of a wide class of bipartite and multipartite lattices, opening new paths for theoretical exploration and new challenges for experimental realization in topological quantum matter.

Recent developments have reported on the feasibility of interconnecting small quantum registers in a quantum information network of a few meter-scale for distributed quantum computing purposes. This multiple small-scale quantum processors communicating and cooperating to execute computational tasks is considered as a promising solution to the scalability problem of reaching more than thousands of noise-free qubits. Here, we propose and assess a satellite-enabled distributed quantum computing system at the French national scale, based on existing infrastructures in Paris and Nice. We consider a system composed of both a ground and a space segment, allowing for the distribution of end-to-end entanglement between Alice in Paris and Bob in Nice, each owning a few-qubit processor composed of trapped ions. In the context of quantum computing, this entanglement resource can be used for the teleportation of a qubit state or for gate teleportation. We numerically assess the entanglement distribution rate and fidelity generated by this space-based quantum information network, and discuss concrete use cases and service performance levels in the framework of distributed quantum computing.

Random-access quantum memories may offer computational advantages for quantum computers and networks. In this paper, we advance arrays of solid-state quantum memories towards their usage as random-access quantum memory. We perform quantum storage of path and time-bin qubits implemented with weak coherent states at the single-photon level, in an array of ten temporally-multiplexed memory cells with controllable addressing. The qubits can be stored in arbitrary combinations of memory cells, from which they are read-out on demand. We find average fidelities of $95_{-2}^{+2}\;\%$ for path qubits and $91^{+2}_{-2}\;\%$ for time-bin qubits. The measured fidelities violate the classical bounds for both encodings and for all ten cells. We also sequentially store a time-bin qubit in two different memory cells, maintain both qubits simultaneously in the array, and perform a collective read-out. The individual control paired with high storage fidelity represents a significant advance towards a solid-state random-access quantum memory for quantum repeaters and photonic quantum processors.

Characterizing the environmental interactions of quantum systems is a critical bottleneck in the development of robust quantum technologies. Traditional tomographic methods are often data-intensive and struggle with scalability. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for performing Lindblad tomography using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). By embedding the Lindblad master equation directly into the neural network's loss function, our approach simultaneously learns the quantum state's evolution and infers the underlying dissipation parameters from sparse, time-series measurement data. Our results show that PINNs can reconstruct both the system dynamics and the functional form of unknown noise parameters, presenting a sample-efficient and scalable solution for quantum device characterization. Ultimately, our method produces a fully-differentiable digital twin of a noisy quantum system by learning its governing master equation.

Formation of oriented polar molecules with a single shaped pulse

Subjects:
Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
We explore the possibility of forming a oriented polar molecule directly from a pair of colliding atoms. The process comprises the photoassociation and vibrational stabilization along with the molecular orientation. These processes are driven by a single time-dependent, linearly polarized control field and proceeds entirely within the electronic ground state, leveraging the presence of a permanent dipole moment. The control field is found by means of an optimal quantum control algorithm with a single target observable given by the restriction of the orientation operator on a subset of bound levels. We consider a rovibrational model system for the collision of O + H atoms and solve directly the time-dependent Schrodinger equation. We show that the optimized field is capable of enhancing the molecular orientation already induced by the photoassociation and vibrational stabilization thus yielding oriented polar molecules that can be useful for many applications.

Consider a Hermitian operator $A$ acting on a complex Hilbert space of dimension $2^n$. We show that when $A$ has small degree in the Pauli expansion, or in other words, $A$ is a local $n$-qubit Hamiltonian, its operator norm can be approximated independently of $n$ by maximizing $|\braket{\psi|A|\psi}|$ over a small collection $\mathbf{X}_n$ of product states $\ket{\psi}\in (\mathbf{C}^{2})^{\otimes n}$. More precisely, we show that whenever $A$ is $d$-local, \textit{i.e.,} $°(A)\le d$, we have the following discretization-type inequality:
\[ \|A\|\le C(d)\max_{\psi\in \mathbf{X}_n}|\braket{\psi|A|\psi}|.
\] The constant $C(d)$ depends only on $d$. This collection $\mathbf{X}_n$ of $\psi$'s, termed a \emph{quantum norm design}, is independent of $A$, and consists of product states, and can have
cardinality as small as $(1+\eps)^n$, which is essentially tight. Previously, norm designs were known only for homogeneous $d$-localHamiltonians $A$ \cite{L,BGKT,ACKK}, and for non-homogeneous $2$-local traceless $A$ \cite{BGKT}.
Several other results, such as boundedness of Rademacher projections for all levels and estimates of operator norms of random Hamiltonians, are also given.

This work investigates the scaling characteristics of post-compilation circuit resources for Quantum Machine Learning (QML) models on connectivity-constrained NISQ processors. We analyze Quantum Kernel Methods and Quantum Neural Networks across processor topologies (linear, ring, grid, star), focusing on SWAP overhead, circuit depth, and two-qubit gate count. Our findings reveal that entangling strategy significantly impacts resource scaling, with circular and shifted circular alternating strategies showing steepest scaling. Ring topology demonstrates slowest resource scaling for most QML models, while Tree Tensor Networks lose their logarithmic depth advantage after compilation. Through fidelity analysis under realistic noise models, we establish quantitative relationships between hardware improvements and maximum reliable qubit counts, providing crucial insights for hardware-aware QML model design across the full-stack architecture.

Scaling quantum computers, i.e., quantum processing units (QPUs) to enable the execution of large quantum circuits is a major challenge, especially for applications that should provide a quantum advantage over classical algorithms. One approach to scale QPUs is to connect multiple machines through quantum and classical channels to form clusters or even quantum networks. Using this paradigm, several smaller QPUs can collectively execute circuits that each would not be able on its own. However, communication between QPUs is costly as it requires generating and maintaining entanglement, and hence it should be used wisely. In this paper, we evaluate the architectures, and in particular the entanglement patterns, of variational quantum circuits in a distributed quantum computing (DQC) setting. That is, using Qiskit, we simulate the execution of an eight qubit circuit using four QPUs each with two computational and two communication qubits where non-local CX-gates are performed using the remote-CX protocol. We compare the performance of various circuits on a binary classification task where training is executed under ideal and testing under noisy conditions. The study provides initial results on suitable VQC architectures for the DQC paradigm, and indicates that a standard VQC baseline is not always the best choice, and alternative architectures that use entanglement between QPUs sparingly deliver better results under noise.

A key challenge in quantum complexity is how entanglement structure emerges from dynamics, highlighted by advances in simulators and information processing. The Lieb--Robinson bound sets a locality-based speed limit on information propagation, while the Small-Incremental-Entangling (SIE) theorem gives a universal constraint on entanglement growth. Yet, SIE bounds only total entanglement, leaving open the fine entanglement structure. In this work, we introduce Spectral-Entangling Strength, measuring the structural entangling power of an operator, and prove a Spectral SIE theorem: a universal limit for Rényi entanglement growth at $\alpha \ge 1/2$, revealing a robust $1/s^2$ tail in the entanglement spectrum. At $\alpha=1/2$ the bound is qualitatively and quantitatively optimal, identifying the universal threshold beyond which growth is unbounded. This exposes the detailed structure of Schmidt coefficients, enabling rigorous truncation-based error control and linking entanglement to computational complexity. Our framework further establishes a generalized entanglement area law under adiabatic paths, extending a central principle of many-body physics to general interactions. Practically, we show that 1D long-range interacting systems admit polynomial bond-dimension approximations for ground, time-evolved, and thermal states. This closes the quasi-polynomial gap and proves such systems are simulable with polynomial complexity comparable to short-range models. By controlling Rényi entanglement, we also derive the first rigorous precision-guarantee bound for the time-dependent density-matrix-renormalization-group algorithm. Overall, our results extend SIE and provide a unified framework that reveals the detailed structure of quantum complexity.

Quantum reservoir computing has emerged as a promising paradigm for harnessing quantum systems to process temporal data efficiently by bypassing the costly training of gradient-based learning methods. Here, we demonstrate the capability of this approach to predict and characterize chaotic dynamics in discrete nonlinear maps, exemplified through the logistic and Hénon maps. While achieving excellent predictive accuracy, we also demonstrate the optimization of training hyperparameters of the quantum reservoir based on the properties of the underlying map, thus paving the way for efficient forecasting with other discrete and continuous time-series data. Furthermore, the framework exhibits robustness against decoherence when trained in situ and shows insensitivity to reservoir Hamiltonian variations. These results highlight quantum reservoir computing as a scalable and noise-resilient tool for modeling complex dynamical systems, with immediate applicability in near-term quantum hardware.

Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a cornerstone of supervised learning, widely used for data classification. A central component of their success lies in kernel functions, which enable efficient computation of inner products in high-dimensional feature spaces. Recent years have seen growing interest in leveraging quantum circuits --both qubit-based and quantum optical-- for computing kernel matrices, with ongoing research exploring potential quantum advantages. In this work, we investigate two classical techniques for enhancing SVM performance through kernel learning --the Fisher criterion and quasi-conformal transformations-- and translate them into the framework of quantum optical circuits. Conversely, using the example of the displaced squeezed vacuum state, we demonstrate how established concepts from quantum optics can inspire novel perspectives and enhancements in SVM methodology. This cross-disciplinary approach highlights the potential of quantum optics to both inform and benefit from advances in machine learning.

We explore the evolution of a strongly interacting dissipative quantum Ising spin chain that is driven by a slowly varying time-dependent transverse field. This system possesses an extensive number of instantaneous (adiabatic) stationary states which are coupled through non-adiabatic transitions. We analytically calculate the generator of the ensuing slow dynamics and analyze the creation of coherences through non-adiabatic processes. For a certain choice of the transverse field shape, we show that the system solely undergoes transitions among classical basis states after each pulse. The concatenation of many of such pulses leads to an evolution of the spin chain under a many-body dynamics that features kinetic constraints. Our setting not only allows for a quantitative investigation of adiabatic theorems and non-adiabatic corrections in a many-body scenario. It also directly connects to many-body systems in the focus of current research, such as ensembles of interacting Rydberg atoms which are resonantly excited by a slowly varying laser pulse and subject to dephasing noise.

We study multiparty entanglement near measurement induced phase transitions (MIPTs), which arise in ensembles of local quantum circuits built with unitaries and measurements. In contrast to equilibrium quantum critical transitions, where entanglement is short-ranged, MIPTs possess long-range k-party genuine multiparty entanglement (GME) characterized by an infinite hierarchy of entanglement exponents for k >= 2. First, we represent the average spread of entanglement with "entanglement clusters", and use them to conjecture general exponent relations: 1) classical dominance, 2) monotonicity, 3) subadditivity. We then introduce measure-weighted graphs to construct such clusters in general circuits. Second, we obtain the exact entanglement exponents for a 1d MIPT in a measurement-only circuit that maps to percolation by exploiting non-unitary conformal field theory. The exponents, which we numerically verify, obey the inequalities. We also extend the construction to a 2d MIPT that maps to classical 3d percolation, and numerically find the first entanglement exponents. Our results provide a firm ground to understand the multiparty entanglement of MIPTs, and more general ensembles of quantum circuits.

The Hopfield model describes a neural network that stores memories using all-to-all-coupled spins. Memory patterns are recalled under equilibrium dynamics. Storing too many patterns breaks the associative recall process because frustration causes an exponential number of spurious patterns to arise as the network becomes a spin glass. Despite this, memory recall in a spin glass can be restored, and even enhanced, under quantum-optical nonequilibrium dynamics because spurious patterns can now serve as reliable memories. We experimentally observe associative memory with high storage capacity in a driven-dissipative spin glass made of atoms and photons. The capacity surpasses the Hopfield limit by up to seven-fold in a sixteen-spin network. Atomic motion boosts capacity by dynamically modifying connectivity akin to short-term synaptic plasticity in neural networks, realizing a precursor to learning in a quantum-optical system.

Entanglement entropies computed using the holographic Ryu-Takayanagi formula are known to obey an infinite set of linear inequalities, which define the so-called RT entropy cone. The general structure of this cone, or equivalently the set of all valid inequalities, is unknown. It is also unknown whether those same inequalities are also obeyed by entropies computed using the covariant Hubeny-Rangamani-Takayanagi formula, although significant evidence has accumulated that they are. Using Markov states, we develop a test of this conjecture in a heretofore unexplored regime. The test reduces to checking that a given inequality obeys a certain majorization property, which is easy to evaluate. We find that the RT inequalities pass this test and, surprisingly, only RT inequalities do so. Our results not only provide strong new evidence that the HRT and RT cones coincide, but also offer a completely new characterization of that cone.

Contextuality, Holonomy and Discrete Fiber Bundles in Group-Valued Boltzmann Machines

We propose a geometric extension of restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) by allowing weights to take values in abstract groups such as \( \mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{R}) \), \( \mathrm{SU}(2) \), or even infinite-dimensional operator groups. This generalization enables the modeling of complex relational structures, including projective transformations, spinor dynamics, and functional symmetries, with direct applications to vision, language, and quantum learning.
A central contribution of this work is the introduction of a \emph{contextuality index} based on group-valued holonomies computed along cycles in the RBM graph. This index quantifies the global inconsistency or "curvature" induced by local weights, generalizing classical notions of coherence, consistency, and geometric flatness. We establish links with sheaf-theoretic contextuality, gauge theory, and noncommutative geometry, and provide numerical and diagrammatic examples in both finite and infinite dimensions.
This framework opens novel directions in AI, from curvature-aware learning architectures to topological regularization in uncertain or adversarial environments.

Our prototype implements this integration, using a key derivation function to generate secure symmetric and HMAC keys, and evaluates its performance across execution time and network metrics. The approach improves data protection by merging classical efficiency with PQC's quantum resilience and QKD's key security, offering a practical transition path for cryptographic systems.

Ring-polymer surface hopping (RPSH) is a unique mixed quantum-classical dynamics method that seamlessly incorporates nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) into non-adiabatic dynamics simulations via the extended phase-space of a classical ring polymer. Here, we systematically investigate several variants of RPSH in the frameworks of centroid and bead approximations (RPSH-CA and RPSH-BA) in modeling the dynamics of the spin-boson system across different reaction regimes, reorganization energies, and temperatures. Moreover, the effects of including the diagonal Born-Oppenheimer correction (DBOC) on the performance of the RPSH-CA and RPSH-BA methods are investigated. Our results show that the RPSH-CA method, where non-adiabatic transitions are handled at the centroid level, reliably captures NQEs and remains robust across different reaction regimes. Adding DBOC improves the method's accuracy in specific intermediate and non-adiabatic reaction regimes at low temperature. Conversely, adding DBOC to the conventional fewest-switches surface hopping method was found to over-damp the dynamics significantly and reduce accuracy, especially at low temperatures. On the other hand, RPSH-BA results, where non-adiabatic transitions are handled at the level of individual beads of the ring polymers, are generally unreliable unless in the adiabatic reaction regime and at high temperature. The inclusion of DBOC is not particularly helpful in remedying this erratic behavior. As such, RPSH-BA is not recommended for including NQEs in condensed-phase non-adiabatic dynamics simulations despite its early successful reports in 1D scattering models. Our findings clarify when geometric corrections are beneficial or detrimental to non-adiabatic simulations using RPSH, providing practical guidance for atomistic condensed-phase applications.

Design and Optimization of Spin Dynamics in Ge Quantum Dots: g-Factor Modulation, Dephasing Sweet Spots, and Phonon-Induced Relaxation

Subjects:

Accurate modeling of spin dynamics in hole-based quantum dot qubits demands high-fidelity simulations that capture realistic device geometries, material interfaces, and self-consistent electrostatics. Here, we present a comprehensive three-dimensional study of gate-defined quantum dot hole spin qubits in strained Si$_{0.2}$Ge$_{0.8}$/Ge heterostructures. In contrast to prior work relying on idealized confinement or decoupled Poisson-Schrödinger treatments, our approach combines self-consistent electrostatics with a four-band Luttinger-Kohn Hamiltonian to resolve spin-orbit interactions, wavefunction asymmetries, and g-tensor anisotropies in realistic device structures. We quantify the impact of device size and gate bias on wavefunction localization, electric-field-induced g-factor modulation, and identify "sweet spots" in vertical electric field where g-factor sensitivity to charge noise is minimized, enhancing spin dephasing times. Spin relaxation due to phonon coupling is also modeled, revealing size-dependent T1 behavior consistent with strong Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling and a magnetic-field scaling near $B^{-8}$. This work establishes a predictive modeling framework for optimizing spin coherence in planar Ge quantum dots and provides quantitative design guidance for scalable, electrically controlled hole spin qubits in group-IV semiconductors.

It is challenging to build scalable quantum processors capable of both parallel control and local operation. As a promising platform to overcome this challenge, optical lattices offer exceptional parallelism. However, it has been struggling with precise local operations due to relatively narrow lattice spacings. Here, we introduce a new quantum processor incorporating orbit-qubit encoding and internal states (as auxiliary degrees of freedom) to achieve spatially selective operations together with parallel control. With this processor, we generate one-dimensional and two-dimensional cluster states using minimal layers of controlled-Z gates. We experimentally detect the multipartite entanglement of a two-dimensional cluster state involving 123 orbit qubits through direct stabilizer measurements, verifying the full bipartite non-separability. Furthermore, we demonstrate measurement-based quantum computation by implementing single-qubit and two-qubit logical gates, highlighting the flexibility of orbit-qubit operations. Our results establish orbit-qubit optical lattices as a scalable quantum processing architecture, opening new pathways for quantum computation applications.

Spin systems are important to understand various physical properties in quantum many-body systems. We numerically study the Gaussian fixed lines (GFLs) of the $S=1/2$ XXZ chain with next-nearest neighbor (NNN) interaction in the XY phase. The GFLs are the set of points where the coefficient of the umklapp scattering vanishes. We show that the GFLs pass through the ``special points'', which are defined as the points where the $sl_2$ loop algebra symmetry governs in low-energy physics. In addition, we have discussed the Tomonaga-Luttinger parameter K, and the metamagnetism influences the shape of the GFLs.

Measuring pulse heating in Si quantum dots with individual two-level fluctuators

Subjects:

To encode quantum information in semiconductor spin qubits, voltage pulses are necessary for initialization, gate operation, and readout. However, these pulses dissipate heat, shifting spin-qubit frequencies and reducing gate fidelities. The cause of this pulse heating in quantum-dot devices is unknown. Here, we measure pulse heating using charged two-level fluctuators (TLFs) in Si/SiGe quantum dots. We find that the TLFs are susceptible to pulse heating. The amount of heating depends on the pulse amplitude and frequency, but not on the distance between the pulsed gates and the TLFs. The amount of heating also generally depends on the idling voltage of the pulsed gates, suggesting that electrons accumulated under or near the gates contribute to the heating. We hypothesize that reducing the area of the gates with electrons nearby could mitigate the heating.

We compute the degeneracy of energy levels in the Kitaev quantum double model for any discrete group $G$ on any planar graph forming the skeleton of a closed orientable surface of arbitrary genus. The derivation is based on the fusion rules of the properly identified vertex and plaquette excitations, which are selected among the anyons, i.e., the simple objects of the Drinfeld center $\mathcal{Z}(\mathrm{Vec}_G)$. These degeneracies are given in terms of the corresponding $S$-matrix elements and allow one to obtain the exact finite-temperature partition function of the model, valid for any finite-size system.

Electroluminescence of NV Color Centers in Diamond p-i-n Diodes mediated by Charge-state Dynamics

As the electroluminescence (EL) of NV color centers in diamond has been realized in p-i-n diodes,the underlying mechanism remains a puzzle for longer than a decade. In this study,using first-principles approaches,the electronic configurations and the possible transitions are comprehensively investigated. Based on the calculated carrier cross sections and transition rates,the mechanism of the EL of NV centers and the charge-state dynamics are revealed. The continuous EL is maintained by the cycle of NV0 ground (GNV0),NV+ metastable (MNV+) and NV0 excited state (ENV0). The weaker EL intensity compared to photoluminescence (PL) is explained by the bottleneck transition from MNV+ to ENV0 and another non-luminescent transition cycle. Additionally,our results also explain the disappearance of the luminescence of NV- as a result of unbalanced transitions between NV- and NV0. This study not only reveal the mechanism of electroluminescence of NV centers and explain experimental observations,but also provide first-principles insights to understand the charge-dynamics of other color centers under electric and optical field.

Frustration-Enhanced Quantum Annealing Correction Models with Additional Inter-replica Interactions
Tomohiro Hattori, Shu Tanaka

Quantum annealing correction (QAC) models provide a promising approach for mitigating errors in quantum annealers. Previous studies have established that QAC models are crucial for ensuring the robustness of the ground state of the Ising model on hardware. In this work, the effects of QAC models incorporating replicas with additional interactions, specifically, the penalty spin model and the stacked model, are investigated for problems characterized by a small energy gap between the ground and first excited states during quantum annealing, a well-known bottleneck to reaching the ground state. The results demonstrate that these QAC models can obtain the optimal solution within short annealing times by exploiting diabatic transitions, even for problems with a small energy gap. These findings highlight the potential of QAC models as practical near-term algorithms for hardware subject to runtime limitations and control noise.

This study established a quantum-classical hybrid framework that integrates quantum computing paradigm with meshfree finite particle method. By harnessing quantum superposition and entanglement, it hybridized the critical computational kernels (termed as quantum finite particle method). A resource-efficient quantum computational strategy on multi-partitioned zones was proposed, which leverages a fixed small-scale quantum circuit as a fundamental processing unit to handle inner product for arbitrarily sized arrays. This approach employs iterative nesting of the quantum-core operation to accommodate varying input dimensions while maintaining hardware feasibility throughout. Motivated with developed quantum framework, the novel numerical discretization for hybrid quantum computational particle dynamics can be derived commonly and applied in fluid flows. Through a sequence of numerical experiments purposefully, the proposed numerical model was thoroughly validated and analyzed. Results demonstrate that integrating quantum computing to hybridize conventional linear combinations of particle dynamics serves as an effective high performance computing paradigm. By further extending into the numerical investigation of viscoelastic, highly elastic, and purely elastic fluids under high Weissenberg number conditions, the applicability of quantum-hybrid framework is significantly broadened. These advances provide critical insights facilitating the transition of quantum-enhanced fluid simulation toward practical engineering applications.

We quantize D$0$-brane, the simplest representative of the family of supersymmetric Dirichlet p-branes, in its spinor moving frame formulation and analyze its quantum state spectrum. Besides being a preparatory stage for quantization of the complete supersymmetric multiple D$0$-brane (mD$0$) model, which is presently known only in the frame of spinor moving frame formalism, this is interesting as its own: despite the covariant quantization of D=10 D$0$-brane was discussed before, its quantum state spectrum was not analyzed and its field theory, describing that, was not studied.
We show that the quantum state vector of the D$0$-brane is described by an on-shell superfield that collects the fields of the massive counterpart of the linearized type IIA supergravity supermultiplet which can be obtained as massive Kaluza-Klein mode of the dimensional reduction of the eleven dimensional supergravity down to ten dimensions. In conclusion, we briefly discuss a spinor helicity formalism for D$0$-brane which can be used as one of the basic elements for developing type IIA string theory amplitude calculus based on multiparticle generalizations of the on-shell superfields.

Harnessing quantum correlations between photons is an emerging direction in optical spectroscopy, but experimental progress has thus far been limited to fluorescence-detected studies of molecular systems at room temperature. Here, we demonstrate heralded emission detection (HED) under continuous-wave (CW) entangled-photon excitation of near-infrared (NIR)-emitting colloidal III-V quantum dots (QDs) at low temperatures. We use superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) and large-area NIR avalanche photodiodes (APDs) to maximize the time resolution ($\sim$70 ps) and emission count rates ($\sim$2000 cps). To our knowledge, these results represent the first demonstration of HED in the solid state and establish NIR QDs as a bright, tunable model system with longer-lived coherences and integrability with optical cavities as an additional experimental control knob.

Percolation and matrix spectrum through NIB message passing
Pedro Hack
Subjects:

Given its computational efficiency and versatility, belief propagation is the most prominent message passing method in several applications. In order to diminish the damaging effect of loops on its accuracy, the first explicit version of generalized belief propagation for networks, the KCN-method, was recently introduced. This approach was originally developed in the context of two target problems: percolation and the calculation of the spectra of sparse matrices. Later on, the KCN-method was extended in order to deal with inference in the context of probabilistic graphical models on networks. It was in this scenario where an improvement on the KCN-method, the NIB-method, was conceived. We show here that this improvement can also achieved in the original applications of the KCN-method, namely percolation and matrix spectra.

Non-Hermitian quantum geometric tensor and nonlinear electrical response
Kai Chen, Jie Zhu
Subjects:
Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
We demonstrate that the non-Hermitian quantum geometric tensor (QGT) governs nonlinear electrical responses in systems with a spectral line gap. The quantum metric, which is a component of the QGT and takes complex values in non-Hermitian systems, generates an intrinsic nonlinear conductivity independent of the scattering time, while the complex Berry curvature induces a wavepacket-width-dependent response. Using one-dimensional and two-dimensional non-Hermitian models, we establish a universal link between nonlinear dynamics and the QGT, thereby connecting quantum state geometry to observable transport phenomena. Crucially, our analysis indicates that the wavepacket width significantly affects non-Hermitian transport -- a feature absent in Hermitian systems. This framework unifies non-Hermitian response theory by revealing how geometric degrees of freedom encode transport in open and synthetic quantum matter. Our results bridge fundamental quantum geometry with emergent functionality, offering pathways to exploit geometric effects in topological devices and engineered materials.

Quantum instruments are mathematical devices introduced to describe the conditional state change during a quantum process. They are completely positive map valued measures on measurable spaces. We may also view them as non-commutative analogues of joint probability measures. We analyze the $C^*$-convexity structure of spaces of quantum instruments. A complete description of the $C^*$-extreme instruments in finite dimensions has been established. Further, the implications of $C^*$-extremity between quantum instruments and their marginals has been explored.

We continue the work of Belliard, Pimenta and Slavnov (2024) studying the modified rational six vertex model. We find another formula of the partition function for the inhomogeneous model, in terms of a determinant that mix the modified Izergin one and a Vandermonde one. This expression enables us to compute the partition function in the homogeneous limit for the rectangular lattice, and then to study the thermodynamic limit. It leads to a new result, we obtain the first order of free energy with boundary effects in the thermodynamic limit.

Spatiotemporal dynamics of moiré excitons in van der Waals heterostructures

Heterostructures of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) offer unique opportunities in optoelectronics due to their strong light-matter interaction and the formation of dipolar interlayer excitons. Introducing a twist angle or lattice mismatch between layers creates a periodic moiré potential that significantly reshapes the energy landscape and introduces a high-dimensional complexity absent in aligned bilayers. Recent experimental advances have enabled direct observation and control of interlayer excitons in such moiré-patterned systems, yet a microscopic theoretical framework capturing both their thermalization and spatiotemporal dynamics remains lacking. Here, we address this challenge by developing a predictive, material-specific many-body model that tracks exciton dynamics across time, space, and momentum, fully accounting for the moiré potential and the complex non-parabolic exciton band structure. Surprisingly, we reveal that flat bands, which typically trap excitons, can significantly enhance exciton propagation. This counterintuitive behavior emerges from the interplay between the flat-band structure giving rise to a bottleneck effect for exciton relaxation and thermal occupation dynamics creating hot excitons. Our work not only reveals the microscopic mechanisms behind the enhanced propagation but also enables the control of exciton transport via twist-angle engineering. These insights lay the foundation for next-generation moiré-based optoelectronic and quantum technologies.

We propose an O(100)m Atom Interferometer (AI) experiment to be installed against a wall of the PX46 access shaft to the LHC. This experiment would probe unexplored ranges of the possible couplings of bosonic ultralight dark matter (ULDM) to atomic constituents and undertake a pioneering search for gravitational waves (GWs) at frequencies intermediate between those to which existing and planned experiments are sensitive, among other fundamental physics studies. A conceptual feasibility study showed that this AI experiment could be isolated from the LHC by installing a shielding wall in the TX46 gallery, and surveyed issues related to the proximity of the LHC machine, finding no technical obstacles. A detailed technical implementation study has shown that the preparatory civil-engineering work, installation of bespoke radiation shielding, deployment of access-control systems and safety alarms, and installation of an elevator platform could be carried out during LS3, allowing installation and operation of the detector to proceed during Run 4 without impacting HL-LHC operation. These studies have established that PX46 is a uniquely promising location for an AI experiment. We foresee that, if the CERN management encourages this Letter of Intent, a significant fraction of the Terrestrial Very Long Baseline Atom Interferometer (TVLBAI) Proto-Collaboration may wish to contribute to such an AI experiment.

High-fidelity detection of charge transitions in quantum dots (QDs) is a key ingredient in solid state quantum computation. We demonstrate high-bandwidth radio-frequency charge detection in bilayer graphene quantum dots (QDs) using a capacitively coupled quantum point contact (QPC). The device design suppresses screening effects and enables sensitive QPC-based charge readout. The QPC is arranged to maximize the readout contrast between two neighboring, coupled electron and hole QDs. We apply the readout scheme to a single-particle electron-hole double QD and demonstrate time-resolved detection of charge states as well as magnetic field dependent tunneling rates. This promises a high-fidelity readout scheme for individual spin and valley states, which is important for the operation of spin, valley or spin-valley qubits in bilayer graphene.

Neutral atom quantum computing's great scaling potential has resulted in it emerging as a popular modality in recent years. For state preparation, atoms are loaded stochastically and have to be detected and rearranged at runtime to create a predetermined initial configuration for circuit execution. Such rearrangement schemes either suffer from low parallelizability for acousto-optic deflector (AOD)-based approaches or are comparatively slow in case of spatial light modulators (SLMs). In our work, we introduce an algorithm that can improve the parallelizability of the former. Since the transfer of atoms from static SLM traps to AOD-generated movable traps is detrimental both in terms of atom loss rates and execution time, our approach is based on highly-parallel composite moves where many atoms are picked up simultaneously and maneuvered into target positions that may be comparatively distant. We see that our algorithm outperforms its alternatives for near-term devices with up to around 1000 qubits and has the potential to scale up to several thousand with further optimizations.

Cold atoms are promising platforms for metrology and quantum computation, yet their many-body dynamics remains largely unexplored. We here investigate Rabi oscillations from optically-thick cold clouds, driven by high-intensity coherent light. A dynamical displacement from the atomic resonance is predicted, which can be detected through the collective Rabi oscillations of the atomic ensemble. Different from linear-optics shifts, this dynamical displacement grows quadratically with the optical depth, yet it reduces with increasing pump power as dipole-dipole interactions are less effective. This modification may be particularly important for Ramsey spectroscopy, when strong pulses and optically dense samples are used.

Arrays of neutral atoms present a promising system for quantum computing, quantum sensors, and other applications, several of which would profit from the ability to load, cool, and image the atoms in a finite magnetic field. In this work, we develop a technique to image and prepare $^{87}$Rb atom arrays in a finite magnetic field by combining EIT cooling with fluorescence imaging. We achieve 99.6(3)% readout fidelity at 98.2(3)% survival probability and up to 68(2)% single-atom stochastic loading probability. We further develop a model to predict the survival probability, which also agrees well with several other atom array experiments. Our technique cools both the axial and radial directions, and will enable future continuously-operated neutral atom quantum processors and quantum sensors.

This is the manual of the first version of QEDtool, an object-oriented Python package that performs numerical quantum electrodynamics calculations, with focus on full state reconstruction in the internal degrees of freedom, correlations and entanglement quantification. Our package rests on the evaluation of polarized Feynman amplitudes in the momentum-helicity basis within a relativistic framework. Users can specify both pure and mixed initial scattering states in polarization space. From the specified initial state and polarized Feynman amplitudes, QEDtool reconstructs correlations that fully characterize the quantum polarization and entanglement within the final state. These quantities can be expressed in any inertial frame by arbitrary, built-in Lorentz transformations.

We use a cavity optomechanical accelerometer to perform a resonant search for ultralight dark matter at acoustic frequencies near 39 kHz (a particle mass of $0.16$ neV/$c^2$). The accelerometer is based on a Si$_3$N$_4$ membrane, cryogenically cooled to 4 K, with photothermal heating employed to scan the resonance frequency by $10^2$ detector linewidths. Leveraging shot-noise-limited displacement readout and radiation pressure feedback cooling, we realize an acceleration resolution of $\sim 10\;\text{n}g_0/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ over a bandwidth of $30$ Hz near the fundamental test mass resonance. We find no evidence of a dark matter signal and infer an upper bound on the coupling to normal matter that is several orders of magnitude above the stringent bounds set by equivalence principle experiments. We outline a path toward novel dark matter constraints in future experiments by exploiting arrays of mass-loaded optomechanical sensors at lower temperature probed with distributed squeezed light.

The interplay between topology and strong interactions gives rise to a variety of exotic quantum phases, including fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states and their lattice analogs - fractional Chern insulators (FCIs). Such topologically ordered states host fractionalized excitations, which for spinful systems are often accompanied by ferromagnetism and skyrmions. Here, we study a Hofstadter-Hubbard model of spinful fermions on a square lattice, extended by nearest-neighbor interactions. Using large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we demonstrate the emergence of a spin-polarized $\frac{1}{3}$-Laughlin-like FCI phase, characterized by a quantized many-body Chern number, a finite charge gap, and hidden off-diagonal long-range order. We further investigate the quantum Hall ferromagnet at $\nu=1$ and its skyrmionic excitations upon doping. In particular, we find that nearest-neighbor repulsion is sufficient to stabilize both particle- and hole-skyrmions in the ground state around $\nu=1$, whereas we do not find such textures around $\nu=\frac{1}{3}$. The diagnostic toolbox presented in this work, based on local densities, correlation functions, and spin-resolved observables, is directly applicable in quantum gas microscopy experiments. Our results open new pathways for experimental exploration of FCIs with spin textures in both ultracold atom and electronic systems.

This work presents a deterministic scheme for the teleportation of a single qutrit state, held by the sender Alice, using maximally entangled two-qutrit states as resource channels. These states have been constructed from symmetric and anti-symmetric bases by Leslie, Devin and Lynn (LDL). Leveraging the higher information capacity of qutrits compared to qubits, we employ these nine distinct two-qutrit entangled channels by LDL, for our protocol. For each channel, explicit unitary operations at the receiver Bob's end are derived, ensuring perfect recovery of the unknown qutrit state, initially in possesion of the sender Alice, after the sender performs joint measurements on her qutrits and communicates the outcomes through a classical channel. The proposed framework confirms teleportation with unit fidelity, thereby extending conventional teleportation schemes beyond qubits into higher-dimensional systems. This not only enriches the available toolkit for quantum communication but also highlights the utility of structured entangled states in advancing quantum information processing. The results open new avenues for secure and efficient quantum networks, higher-dimensional cryptographic schemes, and the design of novel quantum algorithms, while laying the groundwork for experimental realizations of deterministic qutrit teleportation.

Quantum adiabaticity in many-body systems and almost-orthogonality in complementary subspace

We investigate why, in quantum many-body systems, the adiabatic fidelity and the overlap between the initial state and instantaneous ground states often yield nearly identical values. Our analysis suggests that this phenomenon results from an interplay between two intrinsic limits of many-body systems: the limit of small evolution parameters and the limit of large system sizes. In the former case, conventional perturbation theory provides a straightforward explanation. In the latter case, a key insight is that pairs of vectors in the Hilbert space orthogonal to the initial state tend to become nearly orthogonal as the system size increases. We illustrate these general findings with two representative models of driven many-body systems: the driven Rice-Mele model and the driven interacting Kitaev chain model.

Extension of the Watanabe-Sagawa-Ueda uncertainty relation for measurement errors to infinite-dimensional systems
Ryosuke Nogami
Subjects:
Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
We extend the Watanabe--Sagawa--Ueda (WSU) uncertainty relations for measurement errors to infinite-dimensional systems. The original WSU formulation provided a definition of measurement errors with a clear physical interpretation based on quantum estimation theory, but was restricted to finite-dimensional systems, excluding important observables such as position and momentum. Using pseudo-inverse forms of positive-semidefinite forms, we develop a framework for classical and quantum estimation theory for models whose parameter space is the set of full-rank states on an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, and derive classical and quantum Cramér--Rao inequalities. We extend the WSU measurement errors to both bounded and unbounded operators, and derive corresponding error-error uncertainty relations. The resulting uncertainty relation inequalities are stronger than the original WSU bound due to an improved derivation method. Our results provide a theoretical framework for applying estimation-based uncertainty relations to observables with continuous values in infinite-dimensional systems.

Quantum variational circuits have gained significant attention due to their applications in the quantum approximate optimization algorithm and quantum machine learning research. This work introduces a novel class of classical probabilistic circuits designed for generating approximate solutions to combinatorial optimization problems constructed using two-bit stochastic matrices. Through a numerical study, we investigate the performance of our proposed variational circuits in solving the Max-Cut problem on various graphs of increasing sizes. Our classical algorithm demonstrates improved performance for several graph types to the quantum approximate optimization algorithm. Our findings suggest that evaluating the performance of quantum variational circuits against variational circuits with sub-universal gate sets is a valuable benchmark for identifying areas where quantum variational circuits can excel.

Universality and scaling laws are hallmarks of equilibrium phase transitions and critical phenomena. However, extending these concepts to non-equilibrium systems is an outstanding challenge. Despite recent progress in the study of dynamical phases, the universality classes and scaling laws for non-equilibrium phenomena are far less understood than those in equilibrium. In this work, using a trapped-ion quantum simulator with single-spin resolution, we investigate the non-equilibrium nature of critical fluctuations following a quantum quench to the critical point. We probe the scaling of spin fluctuations after a series of quenches to the critical Hamiltonian of a long-range Ising model. With systems of up to 50 spins, we show that the amplitude and timescale of the post-quench fluctuations scale with system size with distinct universal critical exponents, depending on the quench protocol. While a generic quench can lead to thermal critical behavior, we find that a second quench from one critical state to another (i.e.~a double quench) results in a new universal non-equilibrium behavior, identified by a set of critical exponents distinct from their equilibrium counterparts. Our results demonstrate the ability of quantum simulators to explore universal scaling beyond equilibrium.

Efficient Pauli channel estimation with logarithmic quantum memory

Here we revisit one of the prototypical tasks for characterizing the structure of noise in quantum devices: estimating every eigenvalue of an $n$-qubit Pauli noise channel to error $\epsilon$. Prior work [14] proved no-go theorems for this task in the practical regime where one has a limited amount of quantum memory, e.g. any protocol with $\le 0.99n$ ancilla qubits of quantum memory must make exponentially many measurements, provided it is non-concatenating. Such protocols can only interact with the channel by repeatedly preparing a state, passing it through the channel, and measuring immediately afterward.
This left open a natural question: does the lower bound hold even for general protocols, i.e. ones which chain together many queries to the channel, interleaved with arbitrary data-processing channels, before measuring? Surprisingly, in this work we show the opposite: there is a protocol that can estimate the eigenvalues of a Pauli channel to error $\epsilon$ using only $O(\log n/\epsilon^2)$ ancilla and $\tilde{O}(n^2/\epsilon^2)$ measurements. In contrast, we show that any protocol with zero ancilla, even a concatenating one, must make $\Omega(2^n/\epsilon^2)$ measurements, which is tight.
Our results imply, to our knowledge, the first quantum learning task where logarithmically many qubits of quantum memory suffice for an exponential statistical advantage. Our protocol can be naturally extended to a protocol that learns the eigenvalues of Pauli terms within any subset $A$ of a Pauli channel with $O(\log\log(|A|)/\epsilon^2)$ ancilla and $\tilde{O}(n^2/\epsilon^2)$ measurements.

Using spacetime Gaussian test functions, we find closed-form expressions for the smeared Wightman function, Feynman propagator, retarded and advanced Green's functions, causal propagator and symmetric propagator of a massless scalar field in the vacuum of Minkowski spacetime. We apply our results to localized quantum systems which interact with a quantum field in Gaussian spacetime regions and study different relativistic quantum information protocols. In the protocol of entanglement harvesting, we find a closed-form expression for the entanglement that can be acquired by probes which interact in Gaussian spacetime regions and obtain asymptotic results for the protocol. We also revisit the case of two gapless detectors and show that the detectors can become entangled if there is two-way signalling between their interaction regions, providing closed-form expressions for the detectors' final state.

Quantum low-density parity-check codes, such as the Kitaev toric code and bivariate bicycle codes, are often defined with periodic boundary conditions, which are difficult to realize in physical systems. In this paper, we present an algorithm for constructing all gapped boundaries and defects of two-dimensional Pauli stabilizer codes. Using the operator algebra formalism, we establish a one-to-one correspondence between the topological data, such as anyon fusion rules and topological spins, of two-dimensional bulk stabilizer codes and one-dimensional boundary anomalous subsystem codes. To make the operator algebra computationally accessible, we adapt Laurent polynomials and convert the tasks into matrix operations, e.g., the Hermite normal form for obtaining boundary anyons and the Smith normal form for determining fusion rules. This approach enables computers to automatically generate all possible gapped boundaries and defects for topological Pauli stabilizer codes through boundary anyon condensation and topological order completion. This streamlines the analysis of surface codes and associated logical operations for fault-tolerant quantum computation. Our algorithm applies to $\mathbb{Z}_d$ qudits for both prime and nonprime $d$, enabling exploration of topological phases beyond the Kitaev toric code. We have applied the algorithm and explicitly demonstrated the lattice constructions of 2 boundaries and 6 defects in the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ toric code, 3 boundaries and 22 defects in the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ toric code, 1 boundary and 2 defects in the double semion code, 1 boundary and 22 defects in the six-semion code, 6 boundaries and 270 defects in the color code, and 6 defects in the anomalous three-fermion code. Finally, we study the boundaries of bivariate bicycle codes, showing that they exhibit large logical dimensions and anyons with long translation periods.

We provide theory, algorithms, and simulations of non-equilibrium quantum systems using a one-dimensional (1D) completely-positive (CP), matrix-product (MP) density-operator ($\rho$) representation. By generalizing the matrix product state's orthogonality center, to additionally store positive classical mixture correlations, the MP$\rho$ factorization naturally emerges. In this work we analytically and numerically examine the virtual freedoms associated with the representation of quantum density operators. Using this augmented perspective, we simplify algorithms in certain limits to integrate the canonical form's master equation dynamics. This enables us to quickly evolve under the dynamics of two-body quantum channels without resorting to optimization-based methods. In addition to this technical advance, we also scale-up numerical examples and discuss implications for accurately modeling hardware architectures and predicting their performance. This includes an example of the quantum to classical transition of informationally leaky, i.e., decohering, qubits. In this setting, due to loss from environmental interactions, non-local complex coherence correlations are converted into global incoherent classical statistical mixture correlations. Lastly, the representation of both global and local correlations is discussed. We expect this work to have applications in additional non-equilibrium settings, beyond qubit engineering.

Aaronson, Bouland, Fitzsimons and Lee introduced the complexity class PDQP (which was original labeled naCQP), an alteration of BQP enhanced with the ability to obtain non-collapsing measurements, samples of quantum states without collapsing them. Although PDQP contains SZK, it still requires $\Omega(N^{1/4})$ queries to solve unstructured search. We formulate an alternative equivalent definition of PDQP, which we use to prove the positive weighted adversary lower-bounding method, establishing multiple tighter bounds and a trade-off between queries and non-collapsing measurements. We utilize the technique in order to analyze the query complexity of the well-studied majority and element distinctness problems. Additionally, we prove a tight $\Theta(N^{1/3})$ bound on search. Furthermore, we use the lower-bound to explore PDQP under query restrictions, finding that when combined with non-adaptive queries, we limit the speed-up in several cases.

As one of the main pillars of quantum technologies, quantum metrology aims to improve measurement precision using techniques from quantum information. The two main strategies to achieve this are the preparation of nonclassical states and the design of optimized measurement observables. We discuss precision limits and optimal strategies in quantum metrology and sensing with a single mode of quantum continuous variables. We focus on the practically most relevant cases of estimating displacements and rotations and provide the sensitivities of the most important classes of states that includes Gaussian states and superpositions of Fock states or coherent states. Fundamental precision limits that are obtained from the quantum Fisher information are compared to the precision of a simple moment-based estimation strategy based on the data obtained from possibly sub-optimal measurement observables, including homodyne, photon number, parity and higher moments. Finally, we summarize some of the main experimental achievements and present emerging platforms for continuous-variable sensing. These results are of particular interest for experiments with quantum light, trapped ions, mechanical oscillators, and microwave resonators.

Properties of Boolean functions can often be tested much faster than the functions can be learned. However, this advantage usually disappears when testers are limited to random samples of a function $f$--a natural setting for data science--rather than queries. In this work we initiate the study of a quantum version of this "data science scenario": quantum algorithms that test properties of $f$ solely from quantum data in the form of copies of the function state $|f\rangle \propto \sum_x|x,f(x)\rangle$.
$\bullet$ New tests. For three well-established properties--monotonicity, symmetry, and triangle-freeness--we show that the speedup lost when restricting classical testers to sampled data can be recovered by quantum algorithms operating solely from quantum data.
$\bullet$ Inadequacy of Fourier sampling. Our new testers use techniques beyond quantum Fourier sampling, and we show that this necessary. In particular, there is no constant-complexity tester for symmetry relying solely on Fourier sampling and random classical samples.
$\bullet$ Classical queries vs. quantum data. We exhibit a testing problem that can be solved from $O(1)$ classical queries but that requires $\Omega(2^{n/2})$ function state copies. The Forrelation problem provides a separation of the same magnitude in the opposite direction, so we conclude that quantum data and classical queries are "maximally incomparable" resources for testing.
$\bullet$ Towards lower bounds. We also begin the study of lower bounds for testing from quantum data. For quantum monotonicity testing, we prove that the ensembles of Goldreich et al. (2000) and Black (2023), which give exponential lower bounds for classical sample-based testing, do not yield any nontrivial lower bounds for testing from quantum data. New insights specific to quantum data will be required for proving copy complexity lower bounds for testing in this model.

We consider the preparation of all the eigenstates of spin chains using quantum circuits. It is known that generic eigenstates of free-fermionic spin chains can be prepared with circuits whose depth grows only polynomially with the length of the chain and the number of particles. We show that the polynomial growth is also achievable for selected interacting models where the interaction between the particles is sufficiently simple. Our working example is the folded XXZ model, an integrable spin chain that exhibits Hilbert space fragmentation. We present the explicit quantum circuits that prepare arbitrary eigenstates of this model on an open chain efficiently. We perform error-mitigated noisy simulations with circuits of up to 13 qubits and different connectivities between qubits, achieving a relative error below 5%. As a byproduct, we extend a recent reformulation of the Bethe ansatz as a quantum circuit from closed to open boundary conditions.

Revisiting Gaussian genuine entanglement witnesses with modern software

Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
Continuous-variable Gaussian entanglement is an attractive notion, both as a fundamental concept in quantum information theory, based on the well-established Gaussian formalism for phase-space variables, and as a practical resource in quantum technology, exploiting in particular, unconditional room-temperature squeezed-light quantum optics. The readily available high level of scalability, however, is accompanied by an increased theoretical complexity when the multipartite entanglement of a growing number of optical modes is considered. For such systems, we present several approaches to reconstruct the most probable physical covariance matrix from a measured non-physical one and then test the reconstructed matrix for different kinds of separability (factorizability, concrete partite separability or biseparability) even in the presence of measurement errors. All these approaches are based on formulating the desired properties (physicality or separability) as convex optimization problems, which can be efficiently solved with modern optimization solvers, even when the system grows. To every optimization problem we construct the corresponding dual problem used to verify the optimality of the solution. Besides this numerical part of work, we derive an explicit analytical expression for the symplectic trace of a positive definite matrix, which can serve as a simple witness of an entanglement witness, and extend it for positive semidefinite matrices. In addition, we show that in some cases our optimization problems can be solved analytically. As an application of our analytical approach, we consider small instances of bound entangled or genuine multipartite entangled Gaussian states, including some examples from the literature that were treated only numerically, and a family of non-Gaussian states.

The excitation of bound states in the continuum (BICs) in two- or multi-qubit systems lies at the heart of entanglement generation and harnessing in Waveguide Quantum Electrodynamics platforms. However, the generation of qubit pair BICs through single-photon scattering is hindered by the fact that these states are effectively decoupled from propagating photons. We prove that scattering of a parity-invariant single photon on a qubit pair, combined with a properly engineered time variation of the qubit detuning, is not only feasible, but also more effective than strategies based on the relaxation of the excited states of the qubits when the distance between the qubits gives rise to non-negligible photon delays (non-Markovian regime). The use of tensor network methods to simulate the proposed scheme enables to include such photon delays in collision models, thus opening the possibility to follow the time evolution of the full quantum system, including qubits and field, and to efficiently implement and characterize the dynamics hence identifying optimal working points for the BIC generation.

Approaching the Quantum Speed Limit in Quantum Gates with Geometric Control

Subjects:
Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
We present a geometric optimization method for implementing quantum gates by optimally controlling the Hamiltonian parameters, with the goal of approaching the Mandelstam-Tamm Quantum Speed Limit (MT-QSL). Achieving this bound requires satisfying precise geometric conditions that govern the evolution of quantum states. We extend this geometric framework to quantum unitary operators in arbitrary dimensions and analyze the conditions necessary for saturation of the bound. Additionally, we show that the quantum brachistochrone, when generalized to operators, does not, in general, saturate the MT-QSL bound. Finally, we propose a systematic optimal control strategy based on geometric principles to approach the quantum speed limit for unitary driving. We illustrate this optimization method on a set of four well-known two-qubit quantum gates. Our procedure significantly reduces the deviation from the optimal quantum speed limit while preserving high quantum fidelity.

We address the characterization of genuine network nonlocal correlations, which remains highly challenging due to the non-convex nature of local correlations even in the simplest scenario, and increasingly so when derived from entangled states that deviate from their ideal forms. We introduce a scalable causally-inferred Bayesian learning framework called the LHV layered neural network, which introduces the rank parameter of the non-ideal combined source state as an untapped resource to learn the local statistics in Bell tests. This reveals these correlations to persist close to the Bell states, with a noise robustness of 0.94-0.95 in the triangle scenario, additionally requiring all sources to send only entangled states with joint entangled measurements as resources. Further, we study the robustness of the genuineness to shared randomness in the network scenario. Apart from the results, the work succeeds in showing that machine learning approaches with foundational domain-specific constraints can greatly benefit the field of quantum foundations.

We identify all pure KD-positive states and all KD-real observables for these KD representations. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition ensuring that all KD-positive states are convex combinations of pure KD-positive states. We prove that for $G=\Z_{d}$, with $d$ a prime power, this condition is satisfied. We provide examples of abelian groups where it is not. In those cases, the convex set of KD-positive states contains states outside the convex hull of the pure KD-positive states.

Atoms, Worldlines, and the Scalar Approximation

The worldline path-integral method, developed thus far for scalar fields, offers promising computational efficiency in general geometries, However, it relies so far on the scalar approximation that decomposes electromagnetic waves into two independent polarizations. In this work, we investigate different theoretical frameworks of fluctuation-induced effects and analyze the limitations of the worldline path-integral method in modeling multiple-atom Casimir-Polder interactions. In particular, we ask the question: how accurate is the scalar approximation? Using the worldline approach, it appears that a simple sum of the contributions from the two polarizations agrees with the exact Casimir-Polder force for two-atom systems. However, it turns out that this agreement is fortuitous. To enable calculations beyond two atoms via worldlines, we develop general N-atom expressions for the Casimir-Polder force within the scalar approximation. For three-body systems, the scalar worldline method fails drastically, predicting significant discrepancies in both magnitude and sign due to strong polarization mixing. Furthermore, we show that the TE/TM decomposition in the worldline method differs from that of the Green-tensor formalism, and we discuss why this is. This study highlights the inadequacy of scalar worldline models that rely on the polarization-decomposition approximation in general geometries.

Classification can be performed using either a discriminative or a generative learning approach. Discriminative learning consists of constructing the conditional probability of the outputs given the inputs, while generative learning consists of constructing the joint probability density of the inputs and outputs. Although most classical and quantum methods are discriminative, there are some advantages of the generative learning approach. For instance, it can be applied to unsupervised learning, statistical inference, uncertainty estimation, and synthetic data generation. In this article, we present a quantum generative multiclass classification strategy, called quantum generative classification (QGC). This model uses a variational quantum algorithm to estimate the joint probability density function of features and labels of a data set by means of a mixed quantum state. We also introduce a quantum map called quantum-enhanced Fourier features (QEFF), which leverages quantum superposition to prepare high-dimensional data samples in quantum hardware using a small number of qubits. We show that the quantum generative classification algorithm can be viewed as a Gaussian mixture that reproduces a kernel Hilbert space of the training data. In addition, we developed a hybrid quantum-classical neural network that shows that it is possible to perform generative classification on high-dimensional data sets. The method was tested on various low- and high-dimensional data sets including the 10-class MNIST and Fashion-MNIST data sets, illustrating that the generative classification strategy is competitive against other previous quantum models.

Fault-Resilience of Dissipative Processes for Quantum Computing

Subjects:
Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
Dissipative processes have long been proposed as a means of performing computational tasks on quantum computers that may be intrinsically more robust to noise. In this work, we prove two main results concerning the error-resilience capabilities of two types of dissipative algorithms: dissipative ground state preparation in the form of the dissipative quantum eigensolver (DQE), and dissipative quantum computation (DQC). The first result is that under circuit-level depolarizing noise, a version of the DQE algorithm applied to the geometrically local, stabilizer-encoded Hamiltonians that arise naturally when fermionic Hamiltonians are represented in qubits, can suppress the additive error in the ground space overlap of the final output state exponentially in the code distance. This enables us to get closer to fault-tolerance for this task without the associated overhead. In contrast, for computation as opposed to ground state preparation, the second result proves that DQC is no more robust to noise than the standard quantum circuit model.

Anticoncentration describes how an ensemble of quantum states spreads over the allowed Hilbert space, leading to statistically uniform output probability distributions. In this work, we investigate the anticoncentration of random Clifford circuits toward the overlap distribution of random stabilizer states. Using exact analytical techniques and extensive numerical simulations based on Clifford replica tensor networks, we demonstrate that random Clifford circuits fully anticoncentrate in logarithmic circuit depth, namely higher-order moments of the overlap distribution converge to those of random stabilizer states. Moreover, we investigate the effect of introducing a controlled number of non-Clifford (magic) resources into Clifford circuits. We show that inserting a polylogarithmic in qudit number of $T$-states is sufficient to drive the overlap distribution toward the Porter-Thomas statistics, effectively recovering full quantum randomness. In short, this fact presents doped tensor networks and shallow Clifford circuits as pseudo-magic quantum states. Our results clarify the interplay between Clifford dynamics, magic-state injection, and quantum complexity, with implications for quantum circuit sampling, many-body quantum physics, and the benchmarking of quantum computational advantage.

Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
Trapped-ion systems are a leading platform for quantum computing. The Mølmer-Sørensen (MS) gate is a widely used method for implementing controlled interactions in multipartite systems. However, due to unavoidable interactions with the environment, quantum states undergo non-unitary evolution, leading to significant deviations from ideal dynamics.
Common techniques such as Quantum Process Tomography (QPT) and Bell State Tomography (BST) are typically employed to evaluate MS gate performance and to characterize noise in the system. In this letter, we propose leveraging the geometric phase as a tool for performance assessment and noise identification in the MS gate. Our findings indicate that the geometric phase is particularly sensitive to environmental noise occurring around twice the clock pulse time. Given that geometric phase measurements do not require full-state tomography, this approach offers a practical and experimentally feasible method to detect entanglement and classify the nature of noise affecting the system.

Fermionic Partial Transpose in the Overlap Matrix Framework for Entanglement Negativity

Over the past two decades, the overlap matrix approach has been developed to compute quantum entanglement in free-fermion systems, particularly to calculate entanglement entropy and entanglement negativity. This method involves the use of partial trace and partial transpose operations within the overlap matrix framework. However, in previous studies, only the conventional partial transpose in fermionic systems has been considered, which does not account for fermionic anticommutation relations. Although the concept of a fermionic partial transpose was introduced by Shapourian et al. [Phys. Rev. B 95, 165101 (2017)], it has not yet been systematically incorporated into the overlap matrix framework. In this paper, we introduce the fermionic partial transpose into the overlap matrix approach, provide a systematic analysis of the validity of partial trace and partial transpose operations, and derive an explicit formula for calculating entanglement negativity in bipartite systems. Additionally, we numerically compute the logarithmic negativity of two lattice models to verify the Gioev-Klich-Widom scaling law. For tripartite geometries, we uncover limitations of the overlap matrix method and demonstrate that the previously reported logarithmic negativity result for a homogeneous one-dimensional chain in a disjoint interval geometry exceeds its theoretical upper bound.

Explaining Robust Quantum Metrology by Counting Codewords

Quantum sensing holds great promise for high-precision magnetic field measurements. However, its performance is significantly limited by noise. The investigation of active quantum error correction to address this noise led to the Hamiltonian-Not-in-Lindblad-Span (HNLS) condition. This states that Heisenberg scaling is achievable if and only if the signal Hamiltonian is orthogonal to the span of the Lindblad operators describing the noise. In this work, we consider a robust quantum metrology setting where the probe state is inspired from CSS codes for noise resilience but there is no active error correction performed. After the state picks up the signal, we measure the code's $\hat{X}$ stabilizers to infer the magnetic field parameter, $\theta$. Given $N$ copies of the probe state, we derive the probability that all stabilizer measurements return $+1$, which depends on $\theta$. The uncertainty in $\theta$ (estimated from these measurements) is bounded by a new quantity, the \textit{Robustness Bound}, which ties the Quantum Fisher Information of the measurement to the number of weight-$2$ codewords of the dual code. Through this novel lens of coding theory, we show that for nontrivial CSS code states the HNLS condition still governs the Heisenberg scaling in our robust metrology setting. Our finding suggests fundamental limitations in the use of linear quantum codes for dephased magnetic field sensing applications both in the near-term robust sensing regime and in the long-term fault tolerant era. We also extend our results to general scenarios beyond dephased magnetic field sensing.

We explore quantum phase transitions in the multiphoton Jaynes-Cummings-Hubbard model (JCHM). Using the mean-field approximation, we demonstrate that the multiphoton JCHM exhibits quantum phase transitions between the Mott insulator (MI) phase, the superfluid phase, and an additional phase we refer to as the forbidden phase. The multiphoton JCHM MI phases are classified according to a conserved quantity associated with the total number of excited atoms and photons. When this conserved quantity diverges toward positive infinity, this system enters the forbidden phase. By analyzing the system, we observe MI, superfluid, and forbidden phases in both the single- and two-photon JCHMs, although the MI phases in the two-photon case are confined to subspaces with small values of the conserved quantity. In contrast, only the superfluid and forbidden phases appear in the three- and four-photon JCHMs, with no MI phase observed.

Towards robust variational quantum simulation of Lindblad dynamics via stochastic Magnus expansion

Subjects:

In this paper, we introduce a novel and general framework for the variational quantum simulation of Lindblad equations. Building on the close relationship between the unraveled Lindblad dynamics, stochastic Magnus integrators, and variational quantum simulation, we propose a high-order scheme for solving the quantum state diffusion equation using exponential integrators. This formulation facilitates the simulation of wavefunction trajectories within the established framework of variational quantum algorithms for time evolution. Our algorithm significantly enhances robustness in two key aspects: the stability of the simulation with large time steps, and the reduction in the number of quantum trajectories required to accurately simulate the Lindblad dynamics in terms of the ensemble average. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm through numerical examples in both classical and quantum implementations, including the transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) with damping, the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex, and the radical pair model (RPM). The simulation accuracy can be systematically improved, and the algorithm remains reliable even in highly oscillatory regimes. These methods are expected to be applicable to a broader class of open quantum systems beyond the specific models considered in this study.

We investigate the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of quantum information in one-dimensional systems undergoing a quantum quench using a local perspective based on the information lattice. This framework provides a scale- and space-resolved decomposition of quantum correlations, enabling a hydrodynamic description of the information flow through well-defined local densities -- termed local information -- and currents. We apply this framework to three local quenches in noninteracting fermionic chains: (i) the release of a single particle into an empty tight-binding chain, (ii) the connection of two critical chains via the removal of a central barrier, and (iii) the coupling of a topological Kitaev chain to a critical chain. In each case, the information lattice reveals the local structure of correlation buildup and information interface effects, going beyond global measures such as the von Neumann entropy. In particular, through the information lattice we uncover the signatures in the local information flow associated with topological edge modes and analytically explain the fractional von Neumann entropy values observed in Majorana quench protocols. Our approach is general and applicable to interacting, disordered, and open systems, providing a powerful tool for characterizing quantum information dynamics.

Structured light offers a powerful approach to tailor light-matter interactions in quantum systems with chiral properties. While chirality has been extensively studied in passive platforms, the role of optical gain in controlling chiral quantum dynamics remains largely unexplored. In this work, we develop a general theoretical framework to describe the dynamics of qubits interacting with structured gain environments, where amplification depends on the light's polarization or momentum. By quantizing the electromagnetic field in linear bianisotropic media with gain and extending the Lindblad formalism to these settings, we derive a master equation governing the qubit's irreversible evolution. We show that chiral gain can break time-reversal symmetry and drive the system toward a symmetry-broken steady state with nonreciprocal properties. This effect is illustrated in detail for moving plasmonic substrates, which exhibit inherently chiral gain that selectively amplifies transitions of a given handedness. Our results establish chiral gain as a novel mechanism for engineering nonreciprocal quantum steady states.

We investigate Perfect Absorption (PA) of radiation, in which incoming energy is entirely dissipated, in a system consisting of molecular spin centers coherently coupled to a planar microwave resonator operated at milliKelvin temperature and in the single photon regime. This platform allows us to fine tune the spin-photon coupling and to control the effective dissipation of the two subsystems towards the environment, thus giving us the opportunity to span over a wide space of parameters. Our system can be effectively described by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian exhibiting distinct Hermitian subspaces. We experimentally show that these subspaces, linked to the presence of PA, can be engineered through the resonator-spin detuning, which controls the composition of the polaritons in terms of photon and spin content. In such a way, the required balance between the feeding and the loss rates is effectively recovered even in the absence of PT-symmetry. We show that Hermitian subspaces influence the overall aspect of coherent spectra of cavity QED systems and enlarge the possibility to explore non-Hermitian effects in open quantum systems. We finally discuss how our results can be potentially exploited for applications, in particular as single-photon switches and modulators.

We introduce ``Windbreaking-as-a-Service'' (WaaS) as an innovative approach to shared transportation in which larger ``windbreaker'' vehicles provide aerodynamic shelter for ``windsurfer'' vehicles, thereby reducing drag and fuel consumption. As a computational framework to solve the large-scale matching and assignment problems that arise in WaaS, we present \textbf{QUEST} (Quantum-Enhanced Shared Transportation). Specifically, we formulate the pairing of windbreakers and windsurfers -- subject to timing, speed, and vehicle-class constraints -- as a mixed-integer quadratic problem (MIQP). Focusing on a single-segment prototype, we verify the solution classically via the Hungarian Algorithm, a Gurobi-based solver, and brute-force enumeration of binary vectors. We then encode the problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) and map it to an Ising Hamiltonian, enabling the use of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and other quantum and classical annealing technologies. Our quantum implementation successfully recovers the optimal assignment identified by the classical methods, confirming the soundness of the QUEST pipeline for a controlled prototype. While QAOA and other quantum heuristics do not guarantee a resolution of the fundamental complexity barriers, this study illustrates how the WaaS problem can be systematically translated into a quantum-ready model. It also lays the groundwork for addressing multi-segment scenarios and potentially leveraging quantum advantage for large-scale shared-transportation instances.

Global locations of Schmidt number witnesses

We investigate global locations of Schmidt number witnesses which are outside of the convex set of all bipartite states. Their locations are classified by interiors of faces of the convex set of all states, by considering the line segments from them to the maximally mixed state. In this way, a nonpositive Hermitian matrix of trace 1 is located outside of one and only one face. Faces of the convex set of all states are classified by subspaces, which are range spaces of states belonging to specific faces. For a given subspace, we show that there exist Schmidt number $k+1$ witnesses outside of the face arising from this subspace if and only if every vector in the orthogonal complement of the subspace has Schmidt rank greater than $k$. Once we have Schmidt number $k+1$ witnesses outside of a face, we also have Schmidt number $2,3,\dots, k$ witnesses outside of the face.

The generalized Lanczos algorithm can provide a universal method for constructing the wave function under the group structure of Hamiltonian. Based on this fact, we obtain an open two-mode squeezed state as the quantum origin for the curvature perturbation. In light of this wave function in the open system, we successfully develop a new method to calculate its corresponding power spectrum by using the Bogoliubov transformation. Unlike traditional approaches, we explicitly retain the Bogoliubov coefficients in terms of the squeezing amplitude \( r_k \) and the squeezing rotation angle \( \phi_k \). As a result, the power spectrum of the open two-mode squeezed state will match that of the Bunch-Davies vacuum numerically. Furthermore, the derivation of the open two-mode squeezed state relies on the second kind Meixner polynomial (equivalent to the generalized Lanczos algorithm) and the symmetry of the Hamiltonian. Therefore, our research may offer a new insight into the calculation of the correlation functions through a group-theoretic perspective.

Whether an almost-commuting pair of operators must be close to a commuting pair is a central question in operator and matrix theory. We investigate this problem for pairs of $C^*$-subalgebras $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ of $M_d(\mathbb{C})$, showing that each operator in $\mathcal{B}$ is $O(d^2\epsilon)$-close in operator norm to an operator in the commutant $\mathcal{A}'$ under two complementary formulations of "$\epsilon$-almost commutation." One formulation is probabilistic, requiring that the operators of $\mathcal{B}$ have small commutators for most Haar-random unitaries acting on $\mathcal{A}$. This first formulation leads to two novel probabilistic generalizations of Stampfli's theorem, which relates an operator's distance from the scalars to the norm of its inner derivation. The second formulation is deterministic, requiring small commutators between the generators of $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$; we analyze this using an approximate Schur's lemma formulated in terms of Weyl-Heisenberg (clock-and-shift) matrices. As an application of our results to quantum information theory, we obtain a quantitative Tsirelson's theorem: in dimension $d$, every $\epsilon$-almost quantum commuting observable model is well approximated by a quantum tensor-product model with error $O(d^2\epsilon)$.

Quantum simulation offers a route to study open-system molecular dynamics in non-perturbative regimes by programming the interactions among electronic, vibrational, and environmental degrees of freedom on similar energy scales. Trapped-ion systems possess this capability, with their native spins, phonons, and tunable dissipation integrated within a single platform. Here, we demonstrate an open-system quantum simulation of charge and exciton transfer in a multi-mode linear vibronic coupling model. Employing tailored spin-phonon interactions alongside reservoir engineering techniques, we emulate a system with two dissipative vibrational modes coupled to donor and acceptor electronic sites and follow its non-equilibrium dynamics. We continuously tune the system from the charge transfer (CT) regime to the vibrationally assisted exciton transfer (VAET) regime by controlling the vibronic coupling strengths. We find that degenerate modes enhance CT and VAET rates at large energy gaps, while non-degenerate modes activate slow-mode pathways that reduce the energy-gap dependence, thus enlarging the window for efficient transfer. These results show that the presence of one additional vibration introduces interfering vibrationally assisted pathways and reshapes non-perturbative quantum excitation transfer. Our work establishes a scalable and hardware-efficient route to simulating chemically relevant, many-mode vibronic processes with engineered environments, guiding the design of next-generation organic photovoltaics and molecular electronics.

Classical simulations of quantum circuits play a vital role in the development of quantum computers and for taking the temperature of the field. Here, we classically simulate various physically-motivated circuits using 2D tensor network ansätze for the many-body wavefunction which match the geometry of the underlying quantum processor. We then employ a generalized version of the boundary Matrix Product State contraction algorithm to controllably generate samples from the resultant tensor network states. Our approach allows us to systematically converge both the quality of the final state and the samples drawn from it to the true distribution defined by the circuit, with GPU hardware providing us with significant speedups over CPU hardware. With these methods, we simulate the largest local unitary Jastrow ansatz circuit taken from recent IBM experiments to numerical precision. We also study a domain-wall quench in a two-dimensional discrete-time Heisenberg model on large heavy-hex and rotated square lattices, which reflect IBM's and Google's latest quantum processors respectively. We observe a rapid buildup of complex loop correlations on the Google Willow geometry which significantly impact the local properties of the system. Meanwhile, we find loop correlations build up extremely slowly on heavy-hex processors and have almost negligible impact on the local properties of the system, even at large circuit depths. Our results underscore the role the geometry of the quantum processor plays in classical simulability.

Superinductors are circuit elements characterised by an intrinsic impedance in excess of the superconducting resistance quantum ($R_\text{Q}\approx6.45~$k$\Omega$), with applications from metrology and sensing to quantum computing. However, they are typically obtained using exotic materials with high density inductance such as Josephson junctions, superconducting nanowires or twisted two-dimensional materials. Here, we present a superinductor realised within a silicon integrated circuit (IC), exploiting the high kinetic inductance ($\sim 1$~nH/$\square$) of TiN thin films native to the manufacturing process (22-nm FDSOI). By interfacing the superinductor to a silicon quantum dot formed within the same IC, we demonstrate a radio-frequency single-electron transistor (rfSET), the most widely used sensor in semiconductor-based quantum computers. The integrated nature of the rfSET reduces its parasitics which, together with the high impedance, yields a sensitivity improvement of more than two orders of magnitude over the state-of-the-art, combined with a 10,000-fold area reduction. Beyond providing the basis for dense arrays of integrated and high-performance qubit sensors, the realization of high-kinetic-inductance superconducting devices integrated within modern silicon ICs opens many opportunities, including kinetic-inductance detector arrays for astronomy and the study of metamaterials and quantum simulators based on 1D and 2D resonator arrays.

Encrypted-state quantum compilation scheme based on quantum circuit obfuscation for quantum cloud platforms

Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Cryptography and Security (cs.CR)
With the rapid advancement of quantum computing, quantum compilation has become a crucial layer connecting high-level algorithms with physical hardware. In quantum cloud computing, compilation is performed on the cloud platforms, which expose user circuits to potential risks such as structural leakage and output predictability. To address these issues, we propose the encrypted-state quantum compilation scheme based on quantum circuit obfuscation (ECQCO), the first secure compilation scheme tailored for the co-location of compilers and quantum hardware for quantum cloud platforms. It applies quantum homomorphic encryption to conceal output states and instantiates a structure obfuscation mechanism based on quantum indistinguishability obfuscation, effectively protecting both functionality and topology of the circuit. Additionally, an adaptive decoupling obfuscation algorithm is designed to suppress potential idle errors while inserting pulse operations. The proposed scheme achieves information-theoretic security and guarantees computational indistinguishability under the quantum random oracle model. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that ECQCO achieves a total variation distance (TVD) of up to 0.7 and a normalized graph edit distance (GED) of 0.88, enhancing compilation-stage security. Moreover, it introduces only a slight increase in circuit depth, while keeping the average fidelity change within 1\%, thus achieving a practical balance between security and efficiency.

Scalable, quantum-accessible, and adaptive pseudorandom quantum state and pseudorandom function-like quantum state generators

Subjects:
Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Cryptography and Security (cs.CR)
Pseudorandom quantum states (PRSs) and pseudorandom function-like quantum state (PRFS) generators are quantum analogues of pseudorandom generators and pseudorandom functions. It is known that PRS (and PRFS) can exist even if BQP = QMA (relative to a quantum oracle) or if P = NP (relative to a classical oracle), which does not allow for the existence of one-way functions (relative to these oracles). Hence, these are potentially weaker objects than quantum-secure one-way functions, which can be used to do quantum cryptography.
A desirable property of PRS and PRFS constructions is scalability, which ensures that the security parameter $\lambda$ (which determines indistinguishability from their Haar-random counterparts) can be much larger than $n$ (the number of qubits of the output states). This may be important in some applications where PRS and PRFS primitives are used.
We present an isometric procedure to prepare quantum states that can be arbitrarily random (i.e., the trace distance from the Haar-random state can be arbitrarily small for the true random case, or the distinguishing advantage can be arbitrarily small for the pseudorandom case). Our procedure provides a new method for scalable PRS that introduces no entanglement or correlations with the environment. This naturally gives the first construction for scalable, quantum-accessible, and adaptive PRFS assuming quantum-secure one-way functions.
Our PRFS construction implies various primitives, including long-input PRFS, short-input PRFS, short-output PRFS, non-adaptive PRFS, and classically-accessible adaptive PRFS. This new construction may be helpful in some simplification of the microcrypt zoo (this https URL).

Quantum error-correcting codes with asymptotically lower overheads than the surface code require nonlocal connectivity. Leveraging multilayer routing and long-range coupling capabilities in superconducting qubit hardware, we develop Hardware-Aware Layout, HAL: a robust, runtime-efficient heuristic algorithm that automates and optimizes the placement and routing of arbitrary codes. Using HAL, we generate around 150 explicit layouts of quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes with topological structure -- such as the bivariate bicycle codes and the open-boundary tile codes -- and find that removing the periodic boundaries significantly lowers the hardware complexity with only a moderate reduction of logical efficiency. We also lay out highly nonlocal qLDPC code families -- quantum radial and Tanner codes -- that achieve competitive tradeoffs between hardware complexity and logical efficiency. Based on our findings, we anticipate many novel qLDPC codes to be realizable on near-term superconducting qubit hardware and inform future directions for the co-design of quantum devices and fault-tolerant architectures.

T center defects in silicon provide an attractive platform for quantum technologies due to their unique spin properties and compatibility with mature silicon technologies. We investigate several gate protocols between single T centers, including two probabilistic photon interference-based schemes, a near-deterministic photon scattering gate, and a deterministic magnetic dipole-based scheme. In particular, we study a photon interference-based scheme with feedback which can achieve success probabilities above 50%, and use the photon-count decomposition method to perform the first analytical calculations of its entanglement fidelity and efficiency while accounting for imperfections. We also calculate the fidelity and efficiency of the other schemes. Finally, we compare the performance of all the schemes, considering current and near-future experimental capabilities. In particular, we find that the photon interference-based scheme with feedback has the potential to achieve competitive efficiency and fidelity, making it interesting to explore experimentally.

Deriving the von Neumann equation from the Majorana-Bloch equation for arbitrary spin in any state

Subjects:
Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
After publishing the derivation from the classical Bloch equation to the quantum von Neumann equation to the Schrdinger-Pauli equation for spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$, we proposed renaming the Bloch equation to the Majorana-Bloch equation because Majorana's work predated Bloch's in the presentation of the Bloch equation by 14 years. Here, we first generalize our previous derivation to higher spins or angular momenta in coherent pure states. Using the polynomial representation of the coherent-state projector, we derive an invertible mapping from the Majorana-Bloch equation to the von Neumann equation, establishing a one-to-one correspondence between these two formalisms. Application of the Ehrenfest theorem also shows that expectation values in these states reproduce the classical equation of motion as expected. Then, we obtain arbitrary spin-$s$ states by symmetrizing tensor products of spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ primitives, in accordance with the Majorana construction or the Schur-Weyl duality.

A Superselection Rule for Quantum Causality

Subjects:
Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
Within the process-matrix framework for quantum causality, local laboratories are modeled as independent systems, each capable of implementing arbitrary instruments and selecting its own reference frames. This operational freedom naturally induces a gauge symmetry in the connections between laboratories. We elevate this symmetry to a fundamental principle for the resource-theoretic classification of quantum processes and demonstrate that, in the bipartite case, every covariant process is causally separable. This theorem holds in arbitrary dimensions and applies both to marginals of multipartite quantum circuits and to general reductions across cuts. Since such covariance enforces a strict superselection rule, it provides a structural explanation for why all processes realizable within standard circuit frameworks-including the quantum switch-cannot violate bipartite causal inequalities, even in the asymptotic limit. Our analysis therefore establishes that generating nonclassical causal correlations requires physical resources that fundamentally break the operational independence of laboratories.

Improved lower bound for the worst case Pretty Good Measurement

We derive a new lower bound on the success probability of the Pretty Good Measurement (PGM) for worst-case quantum state discrimination among $m$ pure states. Our bound is strictly tighter than the previously known Gram-matrix-based bound for $m\geq 4$. The proof adapts techniques from Barnum and Knill's analysis of the average-case PGM, applied here to the worst-case scenario. By comparing the PGM to the sequential measurement algorithm, we obtain a guarantee showing that, in the low-fidelity regime, the PGM's success probability decreases quadratically with respect to the pairwise overlap, rather than linearly as in earlier bounds.

Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
Boson sampling is a key candidate for demonstrating quantum advantage, and has already yielded significant advances in quantum simulation, machine learning, and graph theory. In this work, a unification and extension of distinct forms of boson sampling is developed. The devised protocol merges discrete-variable scattershot boson sampling with continuous-variable Gaussian boson sampling. Thereby, it is rendered possible to harness the complexity of more interesting states, such as squeezed photons, in advanced sampling protocols. A generating function formalism is developed for the joint description of multiphoton and multimode light undergoing Gaussian transformations. The resulting analytical tools enable one to explore interfaces of different photonic quantum-information-processing platforms. A numerical simulation of unified sampling is carried out, benchmarking its performance, complexity, and scalability. Entanglement is characterized to exemplify the generation of quantum correlations from the nonlinear interactions of a unified sampler.

We construct a family of static, geometrically local Hamiltonians that inherit eigenstate properties of periodically-driven (Floquet) systems. Our construction is a variation of the Feynman-Kitaev clock -- a well-known mapping between quantum circuits and local Hamiltonians -- where the clock register is given periodic boundary conditions. Assuming the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) holds for the input circuit, our construction yields Hamiltonians whose eigenstates have properties characteristic of infinite temperature, like volume-law entanglement entropy, across the whole spectrum -- including the ground state. We then construct a family of exactly solvable Floquet quantum circuits whose eigenstates are shown to obey the ETH at infinite temperature. Combining the two constructions yields a new family of local Hamiltonians with provably volume-law-entangled ground states, and the first such construction where the volume law holds for all contiguous subsystems.

Stability of Adiabatic States in a Dissipative Three-Level System

Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Optics (physics.optics)
The necessary and sufficient conditions for the stability of adiabatic states in three-level quantum systems are investigated analytically and numerically. Various possible configurations of three-level systems under exact two-photon resonance are considered. It is shown that in all these schemes, the lifetime of the studied states is determined by the dephasing time between levels that are not connected by a dipole transition. An efficient population transfer through the b-state at room temperature is demonstrated despite relatively long relaxation times. It is also demonstrated that, in case of large one-photon detuning, the so-called b-state has the same lifetime as that of the dark state. The evolution of adiabatic states for arbitrary values of single-photon detunings has been studied numerically.

We compare, within the framework of the old Bohr-Sommerfeld atomic model, Uranium (Z=92) versus hypothetical Oganesson (Z=118) relativistic hydrogen-like ions and beyond. Existence of a self-intersecting orbit in the super strong static Coulomb field is demonstrated with the aid of Mathematica computer algebra system. A possibility of a similar 'Oganesson-type' effect in a strong gravitational field is also mentioned. Appearance of a multi self-intersecting trajectory is demonstrated in a hypothetical Unbibium, an element with Z = 122.

Toward Quantum Utility in Finance: A Robust Data-Driven Algorithm for Asset Clustering

Clustering financial assets based on return correlations is a fundamental task in portfolio optimization and statistical arbitrage. However, classical clustering methods often fall short when dealing with signed correlation structures, typically requiring lossy transformations and heuristic assumptions such as a fixed number of clusters. In this work, we apply the Graph-based Coalition Structure Generation algorithm (GCS-Q) to directly cluster signed, weighted graphs without relying on such transformations. GCS-Q formulates each partitioning step as a QUBO problem, enabling it to leverage quantum annealing for efficient exploration of exponentially large solution spaces. We validate our approach on both synthetic and real-world financial data, benchmarking against state-of-the-art classical algorithms such as SPONGE and k-Medoids. Our experiments demonstrate that GCS-Q consistently achieves higher clustering quality, as measured by Adjusted Rand Index and structural balance penalties, while dynamically determining the number of clusters. These results highlight the practical utility of near-term quantum computing for graph-based unsupervised learning in financial applications.

Subjects:
Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
Within the familiar circuit-based quantum computational setting, we introduce and analyze a toy model of a quantum physical device capable of internal, self-referential deliberation. The key idea is to represent "deliberation" as a coherent iterative branching process, in which competing branch-dependent system evolutions are maintained in superposition, with additional control and memory registers recording branch histories, and the policy register adaptively biasing subsequent development. We provide explicit quantum circuit realizations, carry out detailed step-by-step derivations of the entangled control-memory-system-policy dynamics, and analyze the constraints imposed by the no-cloning theorem on coherent information flow. We carefully distinguish between internally adaptive and internally reinforced deliberations, proposing the architectures for both, and also briefly discuss categorical and controlled-Stinespring reformulations, as well as their conceptual implications. Taken together, this frames the proposed model as a plausible setting for exploring how such devices may maintain multiple alternatives in parallel, while performing an internal decision-making process through coherent branching, entanglement, adaptive policy updates, and policy-driven self-modifying unitary dynamics.

Topological phases are expected to carry enhanced computational power, stemming from the long-range entanglement that characterizes them. Here we investigate whether this advantage is reflected in quantum magic, quantified through stabilizer Rényi entropies (SREs). We analyze one-dimensional models with an exact duality between a symmetry-protected topological phase and a trivial one. Surprisingly, a finite (parameters dependent) asymmetry appears only when boundary conditions break the duality, and emerges as well in the transverse-field Ising chain, which lacks topological order. These results complement recent analysis in the literature and show that the total magic of a state is unable to detect topological phases, indicating either that a different property is required to capture their unique quantum contribution, or that not all forms of long-range entanglement constitute a genuine computational resource.

We investigate quantum emitters (QEs) interacting with a photonic structured bath made of bilayer square lattices, where the resonance anti-crossing between the energy bands opens a symmetric middle energy gap. Due to the intrinsic chiral symmetry of the bath and interactions with the square-like band-edges, the QE-photon dressed states generated in this inner bandgap are odd-neighbor, robust, and anisotropic, when the emitters' transition frequencies lie in the middle of the bandgap. We also use giant artificial atoms to engineer and modify the dressed states' patterns. Exotic bound states can lead to spin models with symmetry protection, resulting in fascinating many-body phases. As an example, we show that this proposal can be used to generate both edge states and corner states in the generalized 2D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. This work opens up new avenues for research into innovative quantum many-body physics and quantum simulations with photonic or phononic multilayer structures.

The sensitivity of non-local optical measurements at low light intensities, such as those involved in long baseline telescope arrays, can be improved by using remote entanglement. Here, we demonstrate the use of entangled quantum memories in a quantum network of Silicon-vacancy centers in diamond nano-cavities to experimentally perform such non-local phase measurements. Specifically, we combine the generation of event-ready remote quantum entanglement, photon mode erasure that hides the "which-path" information of temporally and spatially separated incoming optical modes, and non-local, non-destructive photon heralding enabled by remote entanglement to perform a proof-of-concept entanglement-assisted differential phase measurement of weak incident light between two spatially separate stations. Demonstrating successful operation of the remote phase sensing protocol with a fiber link baseline up to 1.55 km, our results open the door for a new class of quantum enhanced imaging applications.

Entanglement phases and phase transitions in monitored free fermion system due to localizations

Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
In recent years, the presence of local potentials has significantly enriched and diversified the entanglement patterns in monitored free fermion systems. In our approach, we employ the stochastic Schrödinger equation to simulate a one-dimensional spinless fermion system under continuous measurement and local potentials. By averaging the steady-state entanglement entropy over many quantum trajectories, we investigate its dependence on measurement and localization parameters. We used a phenomenological model to interpret the numerical results, and the results show that the introduction of local potentials does not destroy the universality class of the entanglement phase transition, and that the phase boundary is jointly characterized by the measurement process and the localization mechanism. This work offers a new perspective on the characterization of the entanglement phase boundary arising from the combined effects of measurement and localization, and provides criteria for detecting this novel phase transition in cold atom systems, trapped ions, and quantum dot arrays.

Robust Areal Thermodynamics of the Schwarzschild Black Hole with Robin Boundary Conditions and Weyl Asymptotics

We formulate an areal thermodynamics for the Schwarzschild black hole that takes the horizon area as the sole macroscopic variable. Quantizing ultrarelativistic interior modes on a regular spacelike slice with a Robin boundary at a stretched horizon leads to a self-adjoint Laplace-Beltrami problem with Heun-type quantization. A maximum-entropy area ensemble introduces an intensive areal temperature $T_A$, and Weyl/heat-kernel asymptotics control the resulting statistical mechanics. The leading equations of state follow universally from the spatial Weyl volume coefficient: in a canonical ensemble of $N$ ultrarelativistic bosons one finds $A = 3 N k_B T_A$ up to a boundary-dependent constant, while in the massless grand-canonical sector $A \propto T_A^{4}$ with a generalized Planck spectrum and a Wien displacement relation. These scaling exponents are insensitive to Dirichlet/Neumann/Robin data and to the foliation; only numerical prefactors vary. Embedding the construction into a static four-dimensional background via Matsubara factorization reproduces the 4D Weyl law and yields a finite matter entropy $S_{\mathrm{rad}} \propto A^{3/4}$, parametrically subleading to the Bekenstein-Hawking term after standard renormalization. The framework provides a concise, mathematically controlled bridge between interior spectral data and macroscopic area relations, clarifying the scope and limitations of areal thermodynamics.

Many-body localization (MBL) lends remarkable robustness to nonequilibrium phases of matter. Such phases can show topological and symmetry breaking order in their ground and excited states, but they may also belong to an anomalous localized topological phase (ALT phase). All eigenstates in an ALT phase are trivial, in that they can be deformed to product states, but the entire Hamiltonian cannot be deformed to a trivial localized model without going through a delocalization transition. Using a correspondence between MBL phases with short-ranged entanglement and locality preserving unitaries - called quantum cellular automata (QCA) - we reduce the classification of ALT phases to that of QCA. This method extends to periodically (Floquet) and quasiperiodically driven ALT phases, and captures anomalous Floquet phases within the same framework as static phases. We considerably develop the study of the topology of QCA, allowing us to classify static and driven ALT phases in low dimensions. The QCA framework further generalizes to include symmetry-enriched ALT phases (SALT phases) - which we also classify in low dimensions - and provides a large class of soluble models suitable for realization in quantum simulators. In systematizing the study of ALT phases, we both greatly extend the classification of interacting nonequilibrium systems and clarify a confusion in the literature which implicitly equates nontrivial Hamiltonians with nontrivial ground states.

Detecting the faint signal of continuous gravitational waves (CWs) stands as a major frontier in gravitational-wave astronomy, pushing the need for detectors whose sensitivity exceeds the standard quantum limit (SQL). Here, we propose an orbital optomechanical (OOM) sensor that exploits the sensitive coupling of an orbitally squeezed $p$-orbital Bose-Einstein condensate to spacetime distortions, enabling the detection of interferometer phase shifts induced by CWs. This sensor achieves a theoretical quantum-noise-limited sensitivity 16 dB below the SQL while reducing the required laser power by five orders of magnitude. The performance arises from a novel noise trade-off: a counter-propagating readout scheme suppresses photonic shot noise, while orbital squeezing minimizes the remaining atomic projection noise. By leveraging quantum control over atomic orbital degrees of freedom, this approach establishes a new framework for interferometric sensing with direct applications to the search for CWs and ultralight dark matter.

Josephson junctions formed in semiconductor nanowires host Andreev bound states and serve as a physical platform to realize Andreev qubits tuned by electrostatic gating. With the Andreev bound state being confined to the nanoscale weak link, it couples to a circuit-QED architecture via the state-dependent supercurrent flowing through the weak link. Thus, increasing this coupling strength is a crucial challenge for this architecture. Here, we demonstrate the fabrication and microwave characterization of a weak link which is defined in an InAs-Al (core-half shell) nanowire and embedded in a superconducting loop with a lumped-element resonator patterned from a thin NbTiN film with high kinetic inductance. We investigated several devices with various weak link lengths and performed spectroscopy that revealed pair transitions and single-quasiparticle transitions arising from spin-orbit split Andreev bound states. Our approach offers a compact geometry and a large resonator impedance above 12 k$\Omega$ at a resonator frequency of 8 GHz, which facilitates large coupling in the system. For the pair transitions, the experimentally observed energy level splitting demonstrates the coupling to an Andreev level of 490 MHz. We apply a perturbative model that shows good agreement with the experimental data and extract the maximum coupling of 968~MHz. Moreover, we show that the coupling is even stronger to an Andreev level with a higher transmission. In addition, spectroscopy of single-quasiparticle transitions reveals spin-orbit split Andreev bound states with the extracted spin-photon coupling of 77 MHz.

The rapid advancement of Quantum Technology (QT) has created a growing demand for a specialized workforce, spanning across academia and industry. This study presents a quantitative analysis of the QT job market by systematically extracting and classifying thousands of job postings worldwide. The classification pipeline leverages large language models (LLMs) whilst incorporating a "human-in-the-loop" validation process to ensure reliability, achieving an F1-score of 89%: a high level of accuracy. The research identifies key trends in regional job distribution, degree and skill requirements, and the evolving demand for QT-related roles. Findings reveal a strong presence of the QT job market in the United States and Europe, with increasing corporate demand for engineers, software developers, and PhD-level researchers. Despite growing industry applications, the sector remains in its early stages, dominated by large technology firms and requiring significant investment in education and workforce development. The study highlights the need for targeted educational programs, interdisciplinary collaboration, and industry-academic partnerships to bridge the QT workforce gap.

We introduce the rare-earth delafossite compound TlYbSe2 - extending the search for quantum spin liquids in frustrated triangular lattice magnets. While the DC magnetisation suggests magnetic exchange interactions in the order of several Kelvin, the zero-field AC magnetisation and heat capacity measurements reveal no signs of long-range magnetic order down to 20 mK, indicating a quantum-disordered ground state. We observe a spin glass transition around ~30 mK at zero field, arguably originating from a small fraction of free spins--with an associated entropy of <3 % of the total Rln2, which is suppressed by an applied field of ~0.02 T. A broad anomaly in the heat capacity measurements between 2-5 K is indicative of short-range spin correlations. Below 350 mK, we observe a robust linear temperature dependence of the heat capacity, accompanied by the complete absence of long-range order at low fields. We propose that a phenomenological theory, based on the interplay between spinons and thermally excited gauge flux excitations, can account for the linear temperature dependence of the heat capacity, and could be widely applicable to similar critical quantum spin liquid candidate materials. The results establish the low-temperature, low-field regime of TlYbSe2 as a prime candidate for field-tunable triangular quantum spin liquid behavior and highlight the importance of thermally excited gauge field excitations.

Gapped Boundaries of Kitaev's Quantum Double Models: A Lattice Realization of Anyon Condensation from Lagrangian Algebras

The macroscopic theory of anyon condensation, rooted in the categorical structure of topological excitations, provides a complete classification of gapped boundaries in topologically ordered systems, where distinct boundaries correspond to the condensation of different Lagrangian algebras. However, an intrinsic and direct understanding of anyon condensation in lattice models, grounded in the framework of Lagrangian algebras, remains undeveloped. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework for constructing all gapped boundaries of Kitaev's quantum double models directly from the data of Lagrangian algebras. Central to our approach is the observation that bulk interactions in the quantum double models admit two complementary interpretations: the anyon-creating picture and the anyon-probing picture. Generalizing this insight to the boundary, we derive the consistency condition for boundary ribbon operators that respect the mathematical axiomatic structure of Lagrangian algebras. Solving these conditions yields explicit expressions for the local boundary interactions required to realize gapped boundaries. We also provide three families of solutions that cover a broad range of cases. Our construction provides a microscopic characterization of the bulk-to-boundary anyon condensation dynamics via the action of ribbon operators. Moreover, all these boundary terms are supported within a common effective Hilbert space, making further studies on pure boundary phase transitions natural and convenient. Given the broad applicability of anyon condensation theory, we believe that our approach can be generalized to planar topological codes, extended string-net models, or higher-dimensional topologically ordered systems.

Recovering Einstein equations from local information recorded by quantum reference frames

We propose that, for a sufficiently small spacelike region $B$, deviations of the metric field from flat space encode the information recorded by a quantum reference frame (RF) placed in $B$. This encoding underlies the metric's ability to specify infinitesimal proper times and proper distances that ideal observers would assign, without requiring their physical presence. For purely classical correlations between the RF and the quantum fields within $B$, our hypothesis reproduces the Einstein equation with an undetermined cosmological constant. In this regime, the metric encodes a classical description of the fields in $B$ as perceived by the RF. When local quantum correlations are included, the Einstein equation arises with a positive cosmological constant, proportional to the surface density of those correlations.

We reinterpret Starobinsky's stochastic inflation as an open quantum system, where short-wavelength modes act as the environment for long-wavelength modes. Using the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, we systematically trace out the environment and derive an effective theory for the reduced density matrix, including deviations from exact de Sitter. The resulting master equation is a Lindblad equation, which reduces to a Fokker-Planck equation for the diagonal elements up to higher orders in the slow-roll expansion, while also yielding a more complete equation in phase space. Finally, we extend the formalism to global de Sitter, for which the associated Fokker-Planck equation lacks equilibrium solutions until the late-time regime $aH \gg 1$.

Computational Complexity (cs.CC); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
In 2004, Aaronson introduced the complexity class $\mathsf{PostBQP}$ ($\mathsf{BQP}$ with postselection) and showed that it is equal to $\mathsf{PP}$. In this paper, we define a new complexity class, $\mathsf{CorrBQP}$, a modification of $\mathsf{BQP}$ which has the power to perform correlated measurements, i.e. measurements that output the same value across a partition of registers. We show that $\mathsf{CorrBQP}$ is exactly equal to $\mathsf{BPP}^{\mathsf{PP}}$, placing it "just above" $\mathsf{PP}$. In fact, we show that other metaphysical modifications of $\mathsf{BQP}$, such as $\mathsf{CBQP}$ (i.e. $\mathsf{BQP}$ with the ability to clone arbitrary quantum states), are also equal to $\mathsf{BPP}^{\mathsf{PP}}$. Furthermore, we show that $\mathsf{CorrBQP}$ is self-low with respect to classical queries. In contrast, if it were self-low under quantum queries, the counting hierarchy ($\mathsf{CH}$) would collapse to $\mathsf{BPP}^{\mathsf{PP}}$. Finally, we introduce a variant of rational degree that lower-bounds the query complexity of $\mathsf{BPP}^{\mathsf{PP}}$.

We build the case that our published chiral soliton model [Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 250402 (2019)] can lead to a genuine quantum time crystal for smaller atom numbers. To do this we compare results from the chiral soliton model with exact numerical solutions for the ground state of the three-particle Schrödinger equation in the limit that the spatial profile of the soliton is largely independent of its center-of-mass motion. The connection between the two approaches is found via the Page-Wootters mechanism, and this is what allows for dynamical evolution even in the quantum ground state, as required for a genuine quantum time crystal.

While tremendous research has revealed that symmetry enriches topological phases of matter, more general principles that protect topological phases have yet to be explored. In this Letter, we elucidate the roles of subspaces in free-fermionic topological phases. A subspace property for Hamiltonians enables us to define new topological invariants. It results in peculiar topological boundary phenomena, i.e., the emergence of an unpaired zero mode or zero-winding skin modes, characterizing subspace-protected topological phases. We establish and demonstrate the bulk-boundary correspondence in subspace-protected topological phases. We further discuss the interplay of the subspace property and internal symmetries. Toward application, we also propose possible platforms possessing the subspace property.

Low-Frequency Scattering of TE and TM Waves by an Inhomogeneous Medium with Planar Symmetry

Comments:
25 pages, 3 figures
Subjects:
Optics (physics.optics); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
Stationary scattering of TE and TM waves propagating in an isotropic medium with planar symmetry is described by Bergmann's equation in one dimension. This is a generalization of Helmholtz equation which allows for developing transfer matrix methods to deal with the corresponding scattering problems. We use a dynamical formulation of stationary scattering to study the low-frequency scattering of these waves when the inhomogeneities of the medium causing the scattering are confined to a planar slab. This formulation relies on the construction of an effective two-level non-Hermitian quantum system whose time-evolution operator determines the transfer matrix. We use it to construct the low-frequency expansions of the transfer matrix and the reflection and transmission coefficients of the medium, introduce a generalization of Brewster's angle for inhomogeneous slabs at low frequencies, and derive analytic conditions for transparency and reflectionlessness of PT-symmetric and non-PT-symmetric slabs at these frequencies. We also discuss the application of this method to deal with the low-frequency scattering of TE and TM waves when the carrier medium occupies a half-space and the waves satisfy boundary conditions with planar symmetry at the boundary of the half-space. Because acoustic waves propagating in a compressible fluid with planar symmetry are also described by Bergmann's equation, our results apply to the low-frequency scattering of these waves.
