Title:
Extended Mittag--Leffler Stability Results for Fuzzy Fractional Systems
Es-said En-naoui
Comments:
11 pages
Subjects:
General Mathematics (math.GM)
We extend Lyapunov--type Mittag--Leffler stability analysis for fuzzy nonlinear fractional differential equations (Caputo sense) and introduce a family of stronger, broadly applicable stability results. In particular, we develop (i) uniform Mittag--Leffler stability for variable-order Caputo derivatives, (ii) input-to-state stability (ISS) in the Mittag--Leffler sense and explicit robustness/ultimate bound estimates, (iii) a converse Mittag--Leffler Lyapunov theorem, (iv) a fractional LaSalle invariance principle adapted to the fuzzy setting, and (v) practical and computational criteria including Lyapunov--Krasovskii functionals for delay systems and levelwise LMI tests for linearized models. The paper presents precise assumptions, proof sketches, and preparatory lemmas in the preliminaries; subsequent sections (Step 2 onward) provide rigorous proofs and illustrative examples.

Title:
Generalized factorials characterized by Dirichlet convolution
Wanli Ma
Subjects:
Number Theory (math.NT)
We extend A.B. Mingarelli's method for constructing generalized factorials. Our extension uses a pair of arithmetic functions $(x, y)$, where $x$ is superadditive. When $x$ is the identity function, our generalized factorial reduces to Mingarelli's. A result on the irrationality of the Euler constant within this framework is given. Using Dirichlet convolution, we characterize when two pairs $(\alpha, \beta)$ and $(x, y)$ generate the same factorials.

A Caveat on Metrizing Convergence in Distribution on Hilbert Spaces
Federico Bassetti, Solesne Bourguin, Simon Campese, Giovanni Peccati
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
We consider Sobolev-type distances on probability measures over separable Hilbert spaces involving the Schatten-$p$ norms, which include as special cases a distance first introduced by Bourguin and Campese (2020) when $p=2$, and a distance introduced by Giné and Leon (1980) when $p=\infty$. Our analysis shows that, unless $p=\infty$, these distances fail to metrize convergence in distribution in infinite dimensions. This clarifies several inconsistencies and misconceptions in the recent literature that arose from confusion between different types of distances.

Title:
Spanning Factorizations in Vertex-Transitive Digraphs of Degree 2
Vance Faber
Comments:
No figures
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
We investigate spanning 1-factorizations in vertex-transitive digraphs of arbitrary out-degree d. The guiding question is whether every such digraph admits a spanning 1-factorization that includes, for each vertex v, all d out-edges (v, F1(v)) from v. Equivalently, does there always exist a spanning factorization containing the empty word together with the full set of generators {F1, ..., Fd}?
This paper addresses the case d = 2. Using the structure of alternating cycles and block systems, we develop a block/phase framework that yields sufficient conditions for including both F1 and F2. We show that certain block obstructions can prevent their simultaneous inclusion, while sharply transitive sets (and hence spanning factorizations) always exist. Our results provide general constraints on feasible block sizes, describe the role of phase distributions, and illustrate the theory with concrete families, including coset digraphs on A5. The necessity of the block criterion remains open, even in degree 2.

Global propagation of singularities for magnetic mechanical systems
Piermarco Cannarsa, Wei Cheng, Jiahui Hong, Wenxue Wei
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Differential Geometry (math.DG)
We prove that singularities propagate globally for viscosity solutions of Hamilton-Jacobi equations related to magnetic mechanical systems on closed Riemannian manifolds. Our main result shows that for any weak KAM solution $u$, the singular set $\text{Sing}\,(u)$ remains invariant under the generalized gradient flow dynamics. The proof combines three key elements: (1) reduction from magnetic to Riemannian systems, (2) analysis of reparameterized flows, and (3) regularization techniques. Compared to previous analytic approaches, our geometric method provides clearer insights into the underlying Riemannian structure. We also establish necessary conditions for singularity existence, particularly when the Euler characteristic is nonzero and the magnetic form is non-exact. This approach does not extend directly to Finsler metrics due to structural differences.

Scattering for the $1d$ NLS with inhomogeneous nonlinearities
Luke Baker, Jason Murphy
Comments:

Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
We prove large-data scattering in $H^1$ for inhomogeneous nonlinear Schrödinger equations in one space dimension for powers $p>2$. We assume the inhomogeneity is nonnegative and repulsive; we additionally require decay at infinity in the case $2<p\leq 4$. We use the method of concentration-compactness and contradiction, utilizing a Morawetz estimate in the style of Nakanishi in order to preclude the existence of compact solutions.

Information Theory (cs.IT)
With the massive deployment of IoT devices in 6G networks, several critical challenges have emerged, such as large communication overhead, coverage limitations, and limited battery lifespan. FL, WPT, multi-antenna AP, and RIS can mitigate these challenges by reducing the need for large data transmissions, enabling sustainable energy harvesting, and optimizing the propagation environment. Compared to conventional RIS, STAR-RIS not only extends coverage from half-space to full-space but also improves energy saving through appropriate mode selection. Motivated by the need for sustainable, low-latency, and energy-efficient communication in large-scale IoT networks, this paper investigates the efficient STAR-RIS mode in the uplink and downlink phases of a WPT-FL multi-antenna AP network with non-orthogonal multiple access to minimize energy consumption, a joint optimization that remains largely unexplored in existing works on RIS or STAR-RIS. We formulate a non-convex energy minimization problem for different STAR-RIS modes, i.e., energy splitting (ES) and time switching (TS), in both uplink and downlink transmission phases, where STAR-RIS phase shift vectors, beamforming matrices, time and power for harvesting, uplink transmission, and downlink transmission, local processing time, and computation frequency for each user are jointly optimized. To tackle the non-convexity, the problem is decoupled into two subproblems: the first subproblem optimizes STAR-RIS phase shift vectors and beamforming matrices across all WPT-FL phases using block coordinate descent over either semi-definite programming or Rayleigh quotient problems, while the second one allocates time, power, and computation frequency via the one-dimensional search algorithms or the bisection algorithm.

Complete Decentralization of Linear Quadratic Gaussian Control for the Discrete Wave Equation
Addie McCurdy, Emily Jensen
Comments:
7 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication IEEE Conference on Decision and Control 2025
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC); Systems and Control (eess.SY)
The linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control problem for the linear wave equation on the unit circle with fully distributed actuation and partial state measurements is considered. An analytical solution to a spatial discretization of the problem is obtained. The main result of this work illustrates that for specific parameter values, the optimal LQG policy is completely decentralized, meaning only a measurement at spatial location $i$ is needed to compute an optimal control signal to actuate at this location. The relationship between performance and decentralization as a function of parameters is explored. Conditions for complete decentralization are related to metrics of kinetic and potential energy quantities and control effort.

Diagonalization of the Toda flow on conjugacy classes of matrices with simple spectrum
David Martínez Torres, Carlos Tomei
Subjects:
Differential Geometry (math.DG)
We construct coordinates on conjugacy classes of traceless complex matrices with simple spectrum that diagonalize the non-periodic Toda vector field. By this we mean that the coordinates, defined on an open and dense neighborhood of any diagonal matrix in the conjugacy class, decouple the Toda vector field into a sum of multiples of the Euler and rotational vector field in $\mathbb{C}$. Using Lie theoretic methods, we extend this construction from $\mathfrak{sl}_\mathbb{C}$ to arbitrary complex semisimple Lie algebras and to their real forms

The column number for 3-modular matrices
Joseph Paat, Zach Walsh, Luze Xu
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO); Optimization and Control (math.OC)
An integer-valued matrix $\mathbf{A}$ is $\Delta$-modular if each $\text{rank}(\mathbf{A}) \times \text{rank}(\mathbf{A})$ submatrix has determinant at most $\Delta$ in absolute value. The column number problem is to determine the maximum number of pairwise non-parallel columns of a rank-$r$, $\Delta$-modular matrix. Exact values for the column number are only known for $r \le 2$ or $\Delta \le 2$. We prove that if $r$ is sufficiently large, then the maximum number of pairwise non-parallel columns of a rank-$r$, $3$-modular matrix is $\binom{r+1}{2} + 2(r-1)$. This settles a conjecture by Lee, Paat, Stallknecht, and Xu on the column number in the case $\Delta = 3$. We complement this main result by showing that there are at least three $3$-modular matrices with pairwise non-isomorphic vector matroids that attain this upper bound. More generally, we show that if $r > \Delta$, then the number of $\Delta$-modular matrices with $\binom{r+1}{2} + (\Delta-1)(r-1)$ pairwise non-parallel columns and pairwise non-isomorphic vector matroids is at least exponential in $\sqrt{\Delta}$; previously only one matrix was known due to Lee et al.

Vanishing Cohomology of Dominant Line Bundles for Real Groups
Jack A. Cook
Comments:
13 pages. Comments welcomed
Subjects:
Representation Theory (math.RT); Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)
In \cite{Broer1993}, it was shown that certain line bundles on $\widetilde{\mathcal{N}}=T^*G/B$ have vanishing higher cohomology. We prove a generalization of this theorem for real reductive groups in the case when $G$ is adjoint. More specifically, if $\mathcal{N}_\theta$ denotes the cone of nilpotent elements in a Cartan subspace $\mathfrak{p},$ we have a similar construction of a resolution of singularities $\widetilde{\mathcal{N}_\theta}.$ We prove that for a certain cone of weights $H^i(\widetilde{\mathcal{N}_\theta},\mathcal{O}_{\widetilde{\mathcal{N}_\theta}}(\lambda))=0$ for $i> 0.$ This follows by combining a simple calculation of the canonical bundle for $\widetilde{\mathcal{N}_\theta}$ with Grauert-Riemanshneider vanishing. We use this to show that for groups of QCT (Definition 2), $\mathbb{C}[\mathcal{N}_\theta]$ is equivalent as a $K$-representation to a certain cohomologically induced module giving a new proof of a result in \cite{KostantRallis1971}.

Notes on symplectic action on $(2,1)$-cycles on $K3$ surfaces
Ken Sato
Comments:
16 pages, 2 figures
Subjects:
Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)
In this paper, we propose and study a conjecture that symplectic automorphisms of a $K3$ surface $X$ act trivially on the indecomposable part $\mathrm{CH}^2(X,1)_{\mathrm{ind}}\otimes \mathbb{Q}$ of Bloch's higher Chow group. This is a higher Chow analogue of Huybrechts' conjecture on the symplectic action on $0$-cycles. We give several partial results verifying our conjecture, some conditional and some unconditional. Our unconditional results include the full proof for Kummer surfaces of product type.

Reinforced dynamics for interacting agents in competitive or cooperative environments
Michele Aleandri, Paolo Dai Pra, Ida Germana Minelli
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
We study systems of interacting reinforced stochastic processes, where agents' decisions evolve under reinforcement, network-mediated interactions, and environmental influences. In competitive environments with irreducible networks, we prove almost sure convergence of agents' states, with bipartite graphs leading to non-deterministic limits and non-bipartite graphs to deterministic ones. These results are extended to reducible networks with cooperative or competitive substructures, using a hierarchical graph representation in which higher-level agents perceive lower-level agents as forcing inputs. A general framework for interacting agents under external forcing is also provided, offering a rigorous characterization of long-term behavior and synchronization phenomena in such systems.

Jets of flat partial connections II
Gabriel Fazoli
Subjects:
Complex Variables (math.CV); Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)
We define and study jets of flat partial connections with respect to singular foliations. In particular, we use the first sheaf of transverse jets to address the problem of extending a flat partial connection to a (flat) meromorphic connection. We then apply our results on the extension problem to classical problems in foliation theory, such as the existence of transversely affine structures and invariant hypersurfaces.

Affine and Projective vector fields on five-dimensional nilpotent Lie groups
M. L. Foka, R.P. Nimpa, M. B. N. Djiadeu
Subjects:
Differential Geometry (math.DG)
This paper presents a complete classification of left-invariant affine and projective vector fields on five-dimensional simply connected nilpotent Lie groups endowed with Riemannian metrics. Building on the classification of left-invariant metrics on five-dimensional nilpotent Lie groups made by FOKa et al., we develop an algebraic characterization of these vector fields on an arbitrary Riemannian Lie group. We then employ this framework to classify left-invariant affine and projective vector fields on simply connected, Riemannian nilpotent Lie groups of dimension five. Key results demonstrate that all projective vector fields in this context are necessarily affine, extending classical results by [Kobayashi1963] on homogeneous spaces. We provide explicit matrix representations of the relevant operators and solve the resulting systems of equations case-by-case using algebraic techniques.

Topological Entropy of Nonlinear Time-Varying Systems
Guosong Yang, Daniel Liberzon
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC); Systems and Control (eess.SY); Dynamical Systems (math.DS)
Two general upper bounds on the topological entropy of nonlinear time-varying systems are established: one using the matrix measure of the system Jacobian, the other using the largest real part of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix with off-diagonal entries replaced by their absolute values. A general lower bound is constructed using the trace of the Jacobian matrix. For interconnected systems, an upper bound is first derived by adapting one of the general upper bounds, using the matrix measure of an interconnection matrix function. A new upper bound is then developed using the largest real part of the eigenvalues of this function. This new bound is closely related to the individual upper bounds for subsystems and implies each of the two general upper bounds when the system is viewed as one of two suitable interconnections. These entropy bounds all depend only on upper or lower limits of the Jacobian matrix along trajectories.

Selective and marginal selective inference for exceptional groups
Peter Hoff, Surya Tokdar
Subjects:
Statistics Theory (math.ST); Methodology (stat.ME)
Statistical analyses of multipopulation studies often use the data to select a particular population as the target of inference. For example, a confidence interval may be constructed for a population only in the event that its sample mean is larger than that of the other populations. We show that for the normal means model, confidence interval procedures that maintain strict coverage control conditional on such a selection event will have infinite expected width. For applications where such selective coverage control is of interest, this result motivates the development of procedures with finite expected width and approximate selective coverage control over a range of plausible parameter values. To this end, we develop selection-adjusted empirical Bayes confidence procedures that use information from the data to approximate an oracle confidence procedure that has exact selective coverage control and finite expected width. In numerical comparisons of the oracle and empirical Bayes procedures to procedures that only guarantee selective coverage control marginally over selection events, we find that improved selective coverage control comes at the cost of increased expected interval width.

Complexity Bounds for Smooth Convex Multiobjective Optimization
Phillipe R. Sampaio
Comments:
16 pages
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)
We study the oracle complexity of finding $\varepsilon$-Pareto stationary points in smooth multiobjective optimization with $m$ objectives. The progress metric is the Pareto stationarity gap $\mathcal{G}(x)$ (the norm of an optimal convex combination of gradients). Our contributions are fourfold. (i) For strongly convex objectives, any span first-order method (iterates lie in the span of past gradients) exhibits linear convergence no faster than $\exp(-\Theta(T/\sqrt{\kappa}))$ after $T$ oracle calls, where $\kappa$ is the condition number, implying $\Theta(\sqrt{\kappa}\log(1/\varepsilon))$ iterations; this matches classical accelerated upper bounds. (ii) For convex problems and oblivious one-step methods (a fixed scalarization with pre-scheduled step sizes), we prove a lower bound of order $1/T$ on the best gradient norm among the first $T$ iterates. (iii) Although accelerated gradient descent is outside this restricted class, it is an oblivious span method and attains the same $1/T$ upper rate on a fixed scalarization. (iv) For convex problems and general span methods with adaptive scalarizations, we establish a universal lower bound of order $1/T^{2}$ on the gradient norm of the final iterate after $T$ steps, highlighting a gap between known upper bounds and worst-case guarantees. All bounds hold on non-degenerate instances with distinct objectives and non-singleton Pareto fronts; rates are stated up to universal constants and natural problem scaling.

Convergence of Pivoted Cholesky Algorithm for Lipschitz Kernels
Sungwoo Jeong, Alex Townsend
Comments:
18 pages, 4 figures
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
We investigate the continuous analogue of the Cholesky factorization, namely the pivoted Cholesky algorithm. Our analysis establishes quantitative convergence guarantees for kernels of minimal smoothness. We prove that for a symmetric positive definite Lipschitz continuous kernel $K:\Omega\times \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ on a compact domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^d$, the residual of the Cholesky algorithm with any pivoting strategy is uniformly bounded above by a constant multiple of the fill distance of pivots. In particular, our result implies that under complete pivoting (where the maximum value of the diagonal of the residual is selected as the next pivot): \begin{equation*}
\|R_n\|_{\infty} = \mathcal{O}(n^{-1/d}), \end{equation*} where $R_n$ is the residual after $n$ Cholesky steps and $\|\cdot\|_\infty$ is the absolute maximum value of $R_n$. Moreover, if $K$ is differentiable in both variables with a Lipschitz derivative, our convergence rate improves to $\mathcal{O}(n^{-2/d})$. Our result closes a gap between theory and practice as previous analyses required $C^2$-regularity of $K$ to establish convergence, whereas empirical evidence indicated robust performance even for non-differentiable kernels. We further detail how our convergence results propagate to downstream applications, including discrete analogues, Gaussian process regression, and the P-greedy interpolation method.

Three-Neighbour Bootstrap Percolation in Thin Three-Dimensional Grids

We improve the status of the problem of determining minimum-sized percolating sets in $a \times b \times c$ grids under the $3$-neighbour process. Using several new constructions, we show that optimal percolating sets exist whenever $\min(a,b,c) \ge 7$. As an important step toward this, we also show that all grids with $\min(a,b,c) \ge 4$ have a percolating set whose size exactly achieves the lower bound $(ab+ac+bc)/3$ whenever this value is an integer.

In this short note, we construct a family of non-regular, and therefore non-decomposable, Lagrangian concordances between Lagrangian fillable Legendrian knots in the standard contact 3-dimensional sphere. More precisely, for every decomposable Lagrangian concordance from $\Lambda_-$ to $\Lambda_+$, where $\Lambda_{\pm}$ are smoothly non-isotopic Legendrian knots, we construct a non-regular Lagrangian concordance from $\Lambda'_+$ to $\Lambda'_-$, where both $\Lambda'_\pm$ are Lagrangian fillable Legendrian knots obtained from $\Lambda_{\pm}$ by sufficiently many positive and negative stabilisations, followed by a sequence of Legendrian satellite operations.

Critical p-biharmonic problems and applications to Hamiltonian systems
Kanishka Perera, Bruno Ribeiro
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
We study fourth-order quasilinear elliptic problems that involve the p-biharmonic operator and Navier boundary conditions. The nonlinear term grows at the critical Sobolev rate. Starting from a Hamiltonian system of two second-order equations, we use an inversion step to reduce it to a single p-biharmonic equation with a lower-order perturbation. We handle both non-resonant and resonant cases and show that the problem admits non-trivial solutions when the forcing term and the superscaled perturbation are small enough. The proof combines concentration-compactness with an abstract critical point method based on the cohomological index. Our theorems cover both homogeneous and nonhomogeneous settings and extend Tarantello's classical results for the Laplacian, improving earlier work on p-biharmonic equations (including the case p = 2) and on critical Hamiltonian systems.

Samantha Pilgrim
Comments:
15 pages, comments welcome
Subjects:
Operator Algebras (math.OA); Dynamical Systems (math.DS)
We initiate a study of a new kind of topological-dynamical stability by investigating when permutations of finite sets within a metric space which are close to being actions by a group can be perturbed to genuine actions. We show these perturbing problems can have solutions in the case of dynamics on the Cantor set, and develop a theoretical framework for potentially producing examples of other perturbing problems with no solution. We also investigate connections with semiprojectivity of $C^*$-algebras. In doing so, we define a notion of conditional semiprojectivity and show that maps of finite-dimensional $C^*$-algebras are conditionally semiprojective, but that the inclusion of $C(S^1)$ into $C(S^1)\rtimes \Gamma$ (for any non-trivial action) is not.

Robust, sub-Gaussian mean estimators in metric spaces

Statistics Theory (math.ST); Probability (math.PR)
Estimating the mean of a random vector from i.i.d. data has received considerable attention, and the optimal accuracy one may achieve with a given confidence is fairly well understood by now. When the data take values in more general metric spaces, an appropriate extension of the notion of the mean is the Fréchet mean. While asymptotic properties of the most natural Fréchet mean estimator (the empirical Fréchet mean) have been thoroughly researched, non-asymptotic performance bounds have only been studied recently.
The aim of this paper is to study the performance of estimators of the Fréchet mean in general metric spaces under possibly heavy-tailed and contaminated data. In such cases, the empirical Fréchet mean is a poor estimator. We propose a general estimator based on high-dimensional extensions of trimmed means and prove general performance bounds. Unlike all previously established bounds, ours generalize the optimal bounds known for Euclidean data. The main message of the bounds is that, much like in the Euclidean case, the optimal accuracy is governed by two "variance" terms: a "global variance" term that is independent of the prescribed confidence, and a potentially much smaller, confidence-dependent "local variance" term.
We apply our results for metric spaces with curvature bounded from below, such as Wasserstein spaces, and for uniformly convex Banach spaces.

Asymptotic Behavior of Homogeneous Complex Monge-Ampere Equations on ALE Kahler manifolds
Qi Yao
Comments:
74 pages
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Differential Geometry (math.DG)
This paper is a sequel to the author's earlier work and investigates the homogeneous complex Monge--Ampere equation (HCMA) on the product space $X \times D$, where $X$ is an asymptotically locally Euclidean (ALE) Kahler manifold and $D subset C$ is the unit disc. We establish precise asymptotic behavior of the solution to the HCMA equation, showing that the decay rate of the solution matches that of the prescribed boundary data and that uniform control in weighted Holder norms can be achieved.
The analysis combines two main ingredients: a redevelopment of pluripotential theory on the noncompact space $X \times D$ and a PDE-based construction of holomorphic disc foliations on the end of $X$, inspired by the works of Semmes and Donaldson. As an application in general Kahler manifolds, the techniques developed in this paper also imply a local regularity result for the HCMA equation.

Module-Theoretic Characterizations of Prufer $v$-Multiplication Domains
Xiaolei Zhang, Hwankoo Kim
Subjects:
Commutative Algebra (math.AC)
We present unified $w$-theoretic characterizations of Prüfer $v$-multiplication domains (P$v$MDs).
A module-theoretic perspective shows that torsion submodules are $w$-pure, and for $(w$-)$\,$finitely generated modules $M$, the canonical sequence
$0\to T(M)\to M\to M/T(M)\to 0$ $w$-splits, resolving an open question of Geroldinger--Kim--Loper.
In a $w$-version of Hattori-Davis theory, these conditions are equivalent to $Tor^R_2(M,N)$ being $GV$-torsion for all $R$-modules $M,N$, equivalently $w$-this http URL$(R)\leq 1$, or $Tor^R_1(X,A)$ being $GV$-torsion for all $X$ and torsion-free $A$, or the Davis map $A\otimes_R B \to \mathcal T\otimes_K \mathcal S$ having $GV$-torsion kernel.
From an overring viewpoint, $R$ is a P$v$MD if and only if for every $R\subseteq T\subseteq K$ and every $w$-maximal ideal $m$, the localization $R_{m}\to T_{\m}$ is a flat epimorphism, so that each overring is $w$-flat and the inclusion is $w$-epimorphic.
Finally, $R$ is a P$v$MD if and only if every pure $w$-injective divisible $R$-module is injective.

Gaussian noise, we give closed-form expressions for RSI using 2x2 Riccati equations, revealing a Pareto frontier between RSI and convergence rate over stepsize and momentum choices. We prove a large-deviation principle for time-averaged suboptimality and show that the rate function is, up to scaling, the convex conjugate of the RSI. We further connect RSI to the $H_{\infty}$-norm, showing that stronger worst-case robustness (smaller $H_{\infty}$ norm) yields sharper decay of tail probabilities. Beyond quadratics, under biased sub-Gaussian gradient errors, we derive non-asymptotic bounds on a finite-time analogue of the RSI, giving finite-time high-probability guarantees and large-deviation bounds. We also observe an analogous trade-off between RSI and convergence-rate bounds for smooth strongly convex functions. To our knowledge, these are the first non-asymptotic guarantees and risk-sensitive analysis of GMMs with biased gradients. Numerical experiments on robust regression illustrate the results.

Local energy decay for 2-D wave equations with variable coefficients

Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
This paper addresses the two-dimensional initial value problem in ${\bf R}^{2}$ for the wave equation with varying spatial coefficients in the main part. Assuming compactness in the support of the initial value, we report that the corresponding local energy decays to an order of magnitude of, for example, $O(t^{-1}\sqrt{\log t})$ after sufficiently large time. For the two-dimensional whole space case, it is crucial to establish the optimal $L^2$-estimate for the solution itself, skillfully avoiding the difficulty of not being able to use useful inequalities such as Hardy-type inequalities in higher dimensional case. We also consider cases where the variable coefficients are slightly generalized. These proofs are developed using the multiplier method.

On the Local-to-Global Principle for Zero-Cycles on Self Products of Elliptic Curves with CM

Subjects:
Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)
For a smooth projective variety $X$ defined over a global field $K$, one can form a notion of Weak Approximation for the Chow group of zero-cycles of $X$. There exists a Brauer-Manin obstruction to Weak Approximation here akin to that for rational points. However, unlike for rational points, it is conjectured that this obstruction is the only one; early versions of this conjecture date back to work of Colliot-Thélène and Sansuc (1981) and of Kato and Saito (1986). In this paper, we provide evidence for this when $X$ is the self-product of an elliptic curve with complex multiplication. For some varieties of this form, we construct infinitely many extensions $L/K$ for which the base change $X\times_K \mathrm{Spec}\ L$ satisfies a local-to-global principle for a fixed prime $p$. We do this via explicitly constructing global zero-cycles, and our results have applications over all but two of the complex multiplication fields.

Fast energy decay for 2-D wave equation with localized damping near spatial infinity
Ryo Ikehata

Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
We consider the Cauchy problem for wave equations with localized damping in ${\bf R}^{2}$. The damping is effective only near spatial infinity. We obtain fast energy decay estimate such that $O(t^{-2}\log t)$ as $t \to \infty$. Unlike the results for the two-dimensional exterior mixed problem case, the difficulty of not being able to use Hardy-type inequalities is overcome by using Poincaré-type inequalities in all spaces and the finite propagation property of the solution to construct an estimate formula. In the two-dimensional case, when comparing the problem in the whole space with that in the exterior domain, we find that there is a significant difference in the sense that the former requires a logarithmic correction to the energy decay rate.

Uplink-Downlink Duality for Beamforming in Integrated Sensing and Communications

Information Theory (cs.IT); Signal Processing (eess.SP)
This paper considers the beamforming and power optimization problem for a class of integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) problems that utilize the communication signals simultaneously for sensing. We formulate the problem of minimizing the Bayesian Cramér-Rao bound (BCRB) on the mean-squared error of estimating a vector of parameters, while satisfying downlink signal-to-interference-and-noise-ratio constraints for a set of communication users at the same time. The proposed optimization framework comprises two key new ingredients. First, we show that the BCRB minimization problem corresponds to maximizing beamforming power along certain sensing directions of interest. Second, the classical uplink-downlink duality for multiple-input multiple-output communications can be extended to the ISAC setting, but unlike the classical communication problem, the dual uplink problem for ISAC may entail negative noise power and needs to include an extra condition on the uplink beamformers. This new duality theory opens doors for an efficient iterative algorithm for optimizing power and beamformers for ISAC.

Normalized solutions to Kirchhoff equation with the Sobolev critical exponent in high dimensional spaces
Ruikang Lu, Qilin Xie, Jianshe Yu
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
The following well-known Kirchhoff equation with the Sobolev critical exponent has been extensively studied,
\begin{equation*}
-\Big(a+b\int_{\mathbb R^N} | \nabla u|^2dx\Big) \Delta u+\lambda u=\mu |u|^{q-2}u+|u|^{2^*-2}u \ \ {\rm in}\ \ \mathbb{R}^N, \ \ N\geq4,
\end{equation*} having prescribed mass $\int_{\mathbb R^N}|u|^2dx=c$, where $a$, $c$ are two positive constants, $b,\mu$ are two parameters, $\lambda$ appears as a real Lagrange multiplier and $2<q<2^*$, $2^*$ is the Sobolev critical exponent. Firstly, for the special case $\mu=0$ and $N\geq4$, the above equation reduces to a pure critical Kirchhoff equation, we obtain a complete conclusion including the existence, nonexistence and multiplicity of the normalized solutions by the variational methods. Secondly, when $\mu>0$, $N\geq5$ and $2<q<2+\frac{4}{N}$, we investigate the existence of the positive normalize solution under suitable assumptions on parameter $b$ and mass $c$. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time to consider the above case, which is a more complicated case not only the difficulties on checking the Palais-Smale condition, but also the constraint functional requesting the intricate concave-convex structure. Lastly, when $\mu>0$ and $N=4$, we obtain a local minimizer solution and a mountain pass solution under explicit conditions on $b$ and $c$. It is worth noting that the second solution is obtained by introducing a new functional to establish a threshold for the mountain pass level, which is the key step for the fulfillment of the Palais-Smale condition. This paper provides a refinement and extension of the results of the normalized solutions for Kirchhoff type problem in high-dimensional spaces.

Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
This work focuses on a class of semi-linear functional stochastic partial differential equations with Markovian switching, in which the switching component may have finite or countably infinite states. The well-posedness of the underlying process is obtained by Skorokhod's representation of the switching component. Then, the exponential mixing of such processes in a finite state space is derived by using the so-called remote start method proposed firstly by Prato and Zabczyk in [10]. Finally, the corresponding result in a countable infinite state space is further obtained via the finite partition method.

p-multigrid method for the discontinuous Galerkin discretization of elliptic problems
Nuo Lei, Donghang Zhang, Weiying Zheng
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
In this paper, we propose a $W$-cycle $p$-multigrid method for solving the $p$-version symmetric interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin (SIPDG) discretization of elliptic problems. This SIPDG discretization employs hierarchical Legendre polynomial basis functions. Inspired by the uniform convergence theory of the $W$-cycle $hp$-multigrid method in [P. F. Antonietti, et al., SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 53 (2015)], we provide a rigorous convergence analysis for the proposed $p$-multigrid method, considering both inherited and non-inherited bilinear forms of SIPDG discretization. Our theoretical results show significant improvement over [P. F. Antonietti, et al., SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 53 (2015)], reducing the required number of smoothing steps from $O(p^2)$ to $O(p)$, where $p$ is the polynomial degree of the discrete broken polynomial space. Moreover, the convergence rate remains independent of the mesh size. Several numerical experiments are presented to verify our theoretical findings. Finally, we numerically verify the effectiveness of the $p$-multigrid method for unfitted finite element discretization in solving elliptic interface problems on general $C^{2} $-smooth interfaces.

Parameterized Controls and Isomorphic Representations of G-Expectations
Guangqian Zhao
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
This paper establishes a fundamental isomorphism between the abstract framework of $G$-expectation and a concrete parameterized family of classical stochastic processes, providing a unified framework for nonlinear stochastic calculus under model uncertainty. We demonstrate that $G$-Brownian motion and related stochastic differential equations (SDEs) can be intrinsically represented as controlled processes $\{B_t^\theta\}_{\theta \in \mathcal{A}^\Theta}$, where $\theta$ denotes an admissible control process taking values in a compact convex parameter set $\Theta$ encoding volatility uncertainty. The core contribution is the construction of a complete algebraic and analytic isomorphism $\Phi$ that preserves all operations including addition, multiplication, function composition, and limit transitions. This isomorphism provides a rigorous mathematical foundation for understanding $G$-martingales, with a distinction between symmetric martingales (fair in all volatility scenarios) and asymmetric martingales (favorable but fair only in the worst-case scenario). We develop a comprehensive theory for solving $G$-SDEs through their parameterized representations, establishing existence and uniqueness results under standard Lipschitz and growth conditions. The framework reveals how bounded control sets preserve these classical conditions while capturing volatility uncertainty. The parameterized control perspective offers both mathematical rigor and computational practicality, enabling the transfer of classical stochastic calculus results to the $G$-expectation framework while maintaining the essential sublinear structure of model uncertainty.

Variable Selection for Additive Global Fréchet Regression

35 pages
Subjects:
Statistics Theory (math.ST); Methodology (stat.ME)
We present a novel framework for variable selection in Fréchet regression with responses in general metric spaces, a setting increasingly relevant for analyzing non-Euclidean data such as probability distributions and covariance matrices. Building on the concept of (weak) Fréchet conditional means, we develop an additive regression model that represents the metric-based discrepancy of the response as a sum of covariate-specific nonlinear functions in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS). To address the absence of linear structure in the response space, we transform the response via squared distances, enabling an interpretable and tractable additive decomposition. Variable selection is performed using Elastic Net regularization, extended to the RKHS setting, and further refined through a local linear approximation scheme that incorporates folded concave penalties such as the SCAD. We establish theoretical guarantees, including variable selection consistency and the strong oracle property, under minimal assumptions tailored to metric-space-valued responses. Simulations and applications to distributional and matrix-valued data demonstrate the scalability, interpretability, and practical effectiveness of the proposed approach. This work provides a principled foundation for statistical learning with random object data.

Coarse non-wandering sets and their filtration
Tomoo Yokoyama
Subjects:
Dynamical Systems (math.DS)
This paper investigates recurrence properties of dynamical systems under the restriction that control is available only through inputs and outputs. We introduce the concept of ``coarse non-wandering'', a generalization of the classical non-wandering concept, and construct an associated filtration based on levels that quantify the closeness of recurrence behavior under input/output-only control. The forward direction of this filtration describes how the level of control relates to recurrence properties, whereas the backward direction captures the robustness of such behaviors and, in particular, guarantees controllability through control applied only at the observation points when the observational noise is sufficiently small. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the existence of a wandering domain is equivalent to the presence of an orbit reachable within finite error but unable to return within any slightly enlarged error bound.

With the rapid advancement of next-generation satellite networks, addressing clustering tasks, user grouping, and efficient link management has become increasingly critical to optimize network performance and reduce interference. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of modern clustering approaches based on machine learning and heuristic algorithms. The experimental results indicate that improved machine learning techniques and graph theory-based methods deliver significantly better performance and scalability than conventional clustering methods, such as the pure clustering algorithm examined in previous research. These advantages are especially evident in large-scale satellite network scenarios. Furthermore, the paper outlines potential research directions and discusses integrated, multi-dimensional solutions to enhance adaptability and efficiency in future satellite communication.

The Correspondence Principle: A bridge between general potential theories and nonlinear elliptic differential operators
F. Reese Harvey, Kevin R. Payne
Comments:

Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
General potential theories concern the study of functions which are subharmonic with respect to a suitable constraint set (called a subequation) in the space of 2-jets. While interesting in their own right, general potential theories are being widely used to study fully nonlinear PDEs determined by degenerate elliptic operators acting on the space of 2-jets. We will discuss a powerful tool, the correspondence principle, which establishes the equivalence between subequation subharmonics (superharmonics) and admissible subsolutions (supersolutions) in the viscosity sense of the PDE determined by every operator which is compatible with a given subequation. The crucial degenerate ellipticity often requires the operator to be restricted to a suitable constraint set, which determines the admissibility. Applications to comparison principles by way of the duality monotonicity fiberegularity method will also be discussed.

This survey paper, based on a talk at the International Congress of Basic Science in Beijing in July 2025, summarizes joint work of the authors with M. Kontsevich [1408.2673] establishing the relation between the ``Algebra of the Infrared" of D. Gaiotto, G. Moore and E. Witten [1506.04087] and the theory of secondary polytopes introduced in the 1990s in the study of higher-dimensional discriminants.
It also summarizes subsequent work with L. Soukhanov [2011.00845] where the tunneling data were observed to be similar to linear algebra data describing perverse sheaves on the complex plane except that in the physical context vector spaces are replaced by triangulated categories. The relevant concept here is that of perverse schobers, which are conjectural categorical analogs of perverse sheaves proposed by M. Kapranov and V. Schechtman [1411.2772].
Finally, we sketch a research program of extending these ideas to $4$-dimensional theories and the resurgence formalism.

Colorful circuits and colorful topes in oriented matroids
Minho Cho, Seunghun Lee, Frédéric Meunier
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
We provide a short proof of a conic version of the colorful Carathéodory theorem for oriented matroids. Holmsen's extension of the colorful Carathéodory theorem to oriented matroids (Advances in Mathematics, 2016) already encompasses several generalizations of the original result, but not its conic version. Our approach relies on a common generalization of Sperner's lemma and Meshulam's lemma - two closely related results from combinatorial topology that have found a number of applications in discrete geometry and combinatorics. This generalization may be of independent interest.
Using a similar approach, we also establish the following colorful theorem for topes, whose special geometric case had not been considered before: Given $n$ topes from a uniform oriented matroid with $n$ elements, if they agree on some element, then there is a way to select a distinct element from each tope, together with its sign, so as to form another tope of the oriented matroid. Motivated by this theorem, we further explore other conditions leading to the same conclusion.

Neural network-based solvers for partial differential equations (PDEs) have attracted considerable attention, yet they often face challenges in accuracy and computational efficiency. In this work, we focus on time-dependent PDEs and observe that coupling space and time in a single network can increase the difficulty of approximation. To address this, we propose a semi-discrete in time method (SDTM) which leverages classical numerical time integrators and random neural basis (RNB). Additional adaptive operations are introduced to enhance the network's ability to capture features across scales to ensure uniform approximation accuracy for multi-scale PDEs. Numerical experiments demonstrate the framework's effectiveness and confirm the convergence of the temporal integrator as well as the network's approximation performance.

On high dimensional maximal functions associated to Gaussians, balls, and spheres

Classical Analysis and ODEs (math.CA)
We prove that for each $p\in (1,\infty),$ the norms on $L^p(\mathbb{R}^d)$ of the maximal functions associated to Gaussians (heat semigroup), balls (Hardy-Littlewood averages), and spheres (spherical averages) converge, as the dimension $d\to \infty,$ to the same quantity $\lambda(p)$. This is derived from the fact that the norms on $L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)$ of the maximal functions corresponding to the differences of Gaussian, ball, and spherical averages converge to zero with the dimension $d.$ The fact is proved with the aid of estimates for Fourier multiplier symbols corresponding to these averages, a general principle that allows us to control the norm of a maximal function corresponding to a Fourier multiplier operator by the norm of the multiplier operator itself, and concentration properties of high dimensional Gaussian random vectors. Moreover, relying on the properties of the $d$-dimensional maximal function for the heat semigroup $\mathcal{G}_\ast^d$, we show that $\lambda(p)$ satisfies $$ \frac25\frac{p}{p-1}\le\|\mathcal{G}_\ast^1\|_{L^p(\mathbb{R})\rightarrow L^p(\mathbb{R})}\le \lambda(p)\le \frac{p}{p-1}. $$ In particular, to obtain the middle inequality we show that the norms on $L^p(\mathbb{R}^d)$ of the maximal function for the heat semigroup are non-decreasing in $d.$

In this paper, we prove that the large $N$ limit of the Langevin dynamics for the spin $O(N)$ model is given by a mean-field stochastic differential equation (SDE) in both finite and infinite volumes. We establish uniform in $N$ bounds for the dynamics, which enable us to demonstrate convergence to the mean-field SDE with polynomial interactions. Furthermore, the mean-field SDE is shown to be globally well-posed for suitable initial distributions. We also prove the existence of stationary measures for the mean-field SDE. For small inverse temperatures, we characterize the large $N$ limit of the spin $O(N)$ model through stationary coupling. Additionally, we establish the uniqueness of the stationary measure for the mean-field SDE.

In particular, we prove the $\Gamma(L^1_{loc})$-convergence as $s\to1^-$ of the rescaled anisotropic nonlocal $s$-fractional perimeters defined with respect to the kernels $k_s(\cdot)$ to a suitable anisotropic perimeter. We do so both in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and on a bounded domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ with Lipschitz boundary.

To cover a permutohedron

Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
The permutohedron $P_n$ of order $n$ is a polytope embedded in $\mathbb{R}^n$ whose vertex coordinates are permutations of the first $n$ natural numbers. It is obvious that $P_n$ lies on the hyperplane $H_n$ consisting of points whose coordinates sum up to $n(n+1)/2$. We prove that if the vertices of $P_n$ are contained in the union of $m$ affine hyperplanes different from $H_n$, then $m\geq n$ when $n \geq 3$ is odd, and $m \geq n-1$ when $n \geq 4$ is even. This confirms a recent conjecture of Hegedüs and Károlyi. Our proof gives an algebraic criterion for a non-standard permutohedron generated by $n$ distinct real numbers to require at least $n$ non-trivial hyperplanes to cover its vertices.

This study provides a comprehensive investigation into the structure and properties of a novel class of rings known as $\Delta$-quasipolar rings, in which for every $a\in R$ there exisxt $p^2=p \in comm^2(a)$ such that $a+p \in \Delta(R)$. Here, $\Delta(R)$ is the largest Jacobson radical subring of $R$ which is closed with respect to multiplication by units of $R$. We have developed a general and comprehensive theoretical framework for $\Delta$-quasipolar rings. Within this framework, we have described the fundamental mathematical properties of these rings and examined their behavior under various classical algebraic structures, such as matrix rings and polynomial rings. Furthermore, we have investigated how this class of rings is related to other well-known ring types in mathematics, such as strongly $\Delta$-clean rings, uniquely clean rings, $J$-quasipolar rings and others.

We develop a theory of Euler and Kolyvagin systems relative to the Nekovář-Selmer complexes of $p$-adic representations over local complete Gorenstein rings.

To illustrate its advantages, we prove new cases of Kato's generalised Iwasawa main conjecture for $\mathbb{Z}_p(1)$ and the $p$-adic Tate modules of rational elliptic curves, as well as of the Quillen-Lichtenbaum conjecture, and we also strengthen existing results on the Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture for CM elliptic curves.

Subjects:

In this paper, we explore (slightly generalized) $f$-Eulerian polynomials introduced by Stanley and frequently appearing in combinatorics. Notable special cases include the classical Eulerian polynomials, the generating polynomials of order polynomials for certain labeled posets, and the $d$-Narayana polynomials. We establish simple sufficient conditions for the reality (and sign) of their zeros and present implications for total positivity of sequences generated by values of polynomials at integers. We further relate these polynomials to generalized Euler's transformations for the generalized hypergeometric functions with integral parameter differences. Exploiting this and other hypergeometric connections, we provide purely hypergeometric proofs for various known and some new properties of $d$-Narayana polynomials. Another family encompassed by our definition of the generalized $f$-Eulerian polynomials is that of Jacobi-Piñeiro type II multiple orthogonal polynomials. Their zero location can thus be analyzed, for both canonical and non-canonical parameter values, without invoking orthogonality. Finally, we present several connection formulas relating $d$-Narayana polynomials to particular Jacobi-Piñeiro polynomials.

For all $n\in \mathbb{N}$ and $2n\leqslant \beta\in 2\mathbb{N}$, it is shown that every $n$-dimensional origin-symmetric convex polytope that has $\beta$ vertices admits an affine image whose isoperimetric quotient is at most a universal constant multiple of $\min\big\{\sqrt{\log(\beta/n)},n\big\}$, which is sharp. The weak isomorphic reverse isoperimetry conjecture is proved for $n$-dimensional convex polytopes that have $O(n)$ facets by demonstrating that any such polytope $K$ has an image $K'$ under a volume preserving matrix and a convex body $L\subseteq K'$ such that the isoperimetric quotient of $L$ is at most a universal constant multiple of $\sqrt{n}$, and also $\sqrt[n]{\mathrm{vol}_n(L)/\mathrm{vol}_n(K)}$ is at least a positive universal constant.

A sphere of spherical objects
Asilata Bapat, Anand Deopurkar, Anthony M. Licata
Subjects:
Representation Theory (math.RT); Combinatorics (math.CO)
Given a Bridgeland stability condition on a 2-Calabi--Yau category, we define a simplicial complex that encodes the Harder--Narasimhan filtrations of spherical objects. For 2-Calabi--Yau categories of type A, we relate this complex to the complex of pointed pseudo-triangulations on configurations of points on the plane. Using this connection, we prove that the complex undergoes piecewise-linear wall-crossings as we vary the stability condition, and is piecewise-linearly homeomorphic to a sphere.
Additionally, we prove that for a generic stability condition on a 2-Calabi--Yau category, a spherical object is determined by the ordered list of its Harder--Narasimhan factors.

Single conflict coloring, adaptable choosability and separation choosability
Carl Johan Casselgren, Kalle Eriksson
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
We study relations between three interrelated notions of graph (list) coloring: single conflict coloring, adapted list coloring and choosability with separation (with $1$ overlapping color between lists of adjacent vertices), and their respective invariants single conflict chromatic number $\chi_{\nleftrightarrow}$, adaptable choosability $ch_{ad}$ and separation choosability $ch_{sep}$. We investigate graphs with small values of these invariants, and construct explicit families of graphs $G$ with $\chi_{\nleftrightarrow}(G) = ch_{ad}(G) > ch_{sep}(G)$, as well as where all three invariants are equal. Furthermore, we consider planar graphs and investigate for which triples $(a,b,c)$, there is a planar graph $G$ with $(ch_{sep}(G), ch_{ad}(G), \chi_{\nleftrightarrow}(G)) = (a,b,c)$. Throughout the paper we pose many questions on these graph coloring parameters, and discuss connections to related coloring invariants such as adapted coloring.

Probability (math.PR)
Let ${\mathbf M}$ be the recurrent symmetric (relativistic) $\alpha$-stable process on ${\mathbb R}^d$. Let ${\mathcal H}^{\mu + F} (:= {\mathcal H} + \mu + F)$ be a Schrödinger type operator with local and non-local perturbations $\mu$ and $F$. If $\mu$ and $F$ satisfy suitable conditions associated with Kato class, we prove the existence of ground state for a Schrödinger type operator relating to ${\mathcal H}^{\mu + F}$. Furthermore, we prove the ground state becomes a probabilistically harmonic function of the Schrödinger operator generated by ${\mathcal H}^{\mu + F}$.

Global stability of the inhomogeneous sheared Boltzmann equation in torus

Homo-energetic solutions to the spatially homogeneous Boltzmann equation have been extensively studied, but their global stability in the inhomogeneous setting remains challenging due to unbounded energy growth under self-similar scaling and the intricate interplay between spatial dependence and nonlinear collision dynamics. In this paper, we introduce an approach for periodic spatial domains to construct global-in-time inhomogeneous solutions in a non-conservative perturbation framework, characterizing the global dynamics of growing energy. The growth of energy is shown to be governed by a long-time limit state that exhibits features not captured in either the homogeneous case or the classical Boltzmann theory. The core of our proof is the derivation of new energy estimates specific to the Maxwell molecule model. These estimates combine three key ingredients: a low-high frequency decomposition, a spectral analysis of the matrix associated with the second-order moment equation, and a crucial cancellation property in the zero-frequency mode of the nonlinear collision term. This last property bears a close analogy to the null condition in nonlinear wave equations.

We present a detailed analysis of the sixth-order Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator and construct three-dimensional ghost-free representations through a Tri-Hamiltonian framework. We identify a six-dimensional Abelian Lie algebra of the PU model's dynamical flow and derive a hierarchy of conserved Hamiltonians governed by multiple compatible Poisson structures. These structures enable the realisation of a complete Tri-Hamiltonian formulation that generates identical dynamical flows. Positive-definite Hamiltonians are constructed, and their relation to the full Tri-Hamiltonian hierarchy is analysed. Furthermore, we develop a mapping between the PU model and a class of three-dimensional coupled second-order systems, revealing explicit conditions for ghost-free equivalence. We also explore the consequences of introducing interaction terms, showing that the multi-Hamiltonian structure is generally lost in such cases.

Path and boundary-path groupoids of finitely aligned higher-rank graphs are often constructed using either filters or graph morphisms. We generalise the graph morphism approach to finitely aligned P-graphs where (Q, P) is a weakly quasi-lattice ordered group, and we show the filter approach and the graph morphism approach yield isomorphic path and boundary-path groupoids. To do this, we define conjugacy of partial semigroup actions such that conjugate actions have isomorphic semidirect product groupoids. Combining our results with others in the literature, we survey many isomorphic presentations of path and boundary-path groupoids at different levels of generality.

Hierarchical Importance Sampling for Estimating Occupation Time for SDE Solutions
Eya Ben Amar, Nadhir Ben Rached, Raul Tempone
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA); Computation (stat.CO)
This study considers the estimation of the complementary cumulative distribution function of the occupation time (i.e., the time spent below a threshold) for a process governed by a stochastic differential equation. The focus is on the right tail, where the underlying event becomes rare, and using variance reduction techniques is essential to obtain computationally efficient estimates. Building on recent developments that relate importance sampling (IS) to stochastic optimal control, this work develops an optimal single level IS (SLIS) estimator based on the solution of an auxiliary Hamilton Jacobi Bellman (HJB) partial differential equation (PDE). The cost of solving the HJB-PDE is incorporated into the total computational work, and an optimized trade off between preprocessing and sampling is proposed to minimize the overall cost. The SLIS approach is extended to the multilevel setting to enhance efficiency, yielding a multilevel IS (MLIS) estimator. A necessary and sufficient condition under which the MLIS method outperforms the SLIS method is established, and a common likelihood MLIS formulation is introduced that satisfies this condition under appropriate regularity assumptions. The classical multilevel Monte Carlo complexity theory can be extended to accommodate settings where the single-level variance varies with the discretization level. As a special case, the variance-decay behavior observed in the IS framework stems from the zero variance property of the optimal control. Notably, the total work complexity of MLIS can be better than an order of two. Numerical experiments in the context of fade duration estimation demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach and validate these theoretical results.

Asymptotic Analysis of Nonlinear One-Bit Precoding in Massive MIMO Systems via Approximate Message Passing

Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT); Signal Processing (eess.SP)
Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems employing one-bit digital-to-analog converters offer a hardware-efficient solution for wireless communications. However, the one-bit constraint poses significant challenges for precoding design, as it transforms the problem into a discrete and nonconvex optimization task. In this paper, we investigate a widely adopted ``convex-relaxation-then-quantization" approach for nonlinear symbol-level one-bit precoding. Specifically, we first solve a convex relaxation of the discrete minimum mean square error precoding problem, and then quantize the solution to satisfy the one-bit constraint. To analyze the high-dimensional asymptotic performance of this scheme, we develop a novel analytical framework based on approximate message passing (AMP). This framework enables us to derive a closed-form expression for the symbol error probability (SEP) at the receiver side in the large-system limit, which provides a quantitative characterization of how model and system parameters affect the SEP performance. Our empirical results suggest that the $\ell_\infty^2$ regularizer, when paired with an optimally chosen regularization parameter, achieves optimal SEP performance within a broad class of convex regularization functions. As a first step towards a theoretical justification, we prove the optimality of the $\ell_\infty^2$ regularizer within the mixed $\ell_\infty^2$-$\ell_2^2$ regularization functions.

Skew braces and Rota-Baxter operators on semi-direct product

Subjects:
Quantum Algebra (math.QA); Group Theory (math.GR); Rings and Algebras (math.RA)
This paper examines the connections between (relative) Rota-Baxter groups, skew left braces, and enlargements of these structures on naturally associated semi-direct products. For any skew left brace, we introduce a new skew left brace, called the square, on the natural semi-direct product of its additive and multiplicative groups. Further, the square construction turns out to be distinct from the previously known double construction arising as a special case of matched pairs of skew braces. This provides a method to construct a new bijective, non-degenerate solution to the Yang-Baxter equation from an existing solution arising from a skew left brace. We show that the square construction is functorial and integrates naturally into both the cohomological and extension- theoretic frameworks for (relative) Rota-Baxter groups and skew left braces. Furthermore, we provide a sufficient condition under which two isoclinic skew left braces yield isoclinic squares.

On the Moreau envelope properties of weakly convex functions

Subjects:

In this document, we present the main properties satisfied by the Moreau envelope of weakly convex functions. The Moreau envelope has been introduced in convex optimization to regularize convex functionals while preserving their global minimizers. However, the Moreau envelope is also defined for the more general class of weakly convex function and can be a useful tool for optimization in this context. The main properties of the Moreau envelope have been demonstrated for convex functions and are generalized to weakly convex function in various works. This document summarizes the vast literature on the properties of the Moreau envelope and provides the associated proofs.

Reconstruction of strong degeneracy region for parabolic equations and systems
Piermarco Cannarsa, Veronica Danesi, Anna Doubova
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
We address the inverse problem of recovering a degeneracy point within the diffusion coefficient of a one-dimensional complex parabolic equation by observing the normal derivative at one point of the boundary. The strongly degenerate case is analyzed. In particular, we derive sufficient conditions on the initial data that guarantee the stability and uniqueness of the solution obtained from a one-point measurement. Moreover, we present more general uniqueness theorems, which also cover the identification of the initial data and the coefficient of the zero order term, using measurements taken over time. Our method is based on a careful analysis of the spectral problem and relies on an explicit form of the solution in terms of Bessel functions. Our investigation also covers the case of real 1-D degenerate parabolic systems of equations coupled with a specific structure. Theoretical results are also supported by numerical simulations.

Anti-pre-Poisson bialgebras and relative Rota-Baxter operators
Qinxiu Sun, Min Wu
Comments:
34pages
Subjects:
Rings and Algebras (math.RA)
In this paper, we first introduce the notion of an anti-pre-Poisson bialgebra, which is shown to be equivalent to both quadratic anti-pre-Poisson algebras and matched pairs of Poisson algebras. The study of coboundary anti-pre-Poisson bialgebras leads to the anti-pre-Poisson Yang-Baxter equation (APP-YBE). Skew-symmetric solutions of this equation give rise to coboundary anti-pre-Poisson bialgebras. Furthermore, we investigate how solutions without skew-symmetry can also induce such bialgebras, prompting the introduction of quasi-triangular and factorizable anti-pre-Poisson bialgebras. In particular, solutions of the APP-YBE whose symmetric parts are invariant induce a quasi-triangular anti-pre-Poisson bialgebra. Such solutions are also interpreted as relative Rota-Baxter operators with weights. Finally, we establish a one-to-one correspondence between quadratic Rota-Baxter anti-pre-Poisson algebras and factorizable anti-pre-Poisson bialgebras.

Subjects:
Statistics Theory (math.ST)
We introduce a general framework for testing statistical hypotheses for probability measures supported on finite spaces, which is based on optimal transport (OT). These tests are inspired by the analysis of variance (ANOVA) and its nonparametric counterparts. They allow for testing linear relationships in factorial designs between discrete probability measures and are based on pairwise comparisons of the OT distance and corresponding barycenters. To this end, we derive under the null hypotheses and (local) alternatives the asymptotic distribution of empirical OT costs and the empirical OT barycenter cost functional as the optimal value of linear programs with random objective function. In particular, we extend existing techniques for probability to signed measures and show directional Hadamard differentiability and the validity of the functional delta method. We discuss computational issues, permutation and bootstrap tests, and back up our findings with simulations. We illustrate our methodology on two datasets from cellular biophysics and biometric identification.

Split Lemma and First Isomorphism Theorem for groupoids
Davide Ferri
Comments:
This is a preliminary version, to be expanded. Comments (including suggested references) are welcome
Subjects:
Group Theory (math.GR); Category Theory (math.CT)
Groupoids are the oidification of groups, and they are largely used in topology and representation theory. We consider here the category $\mathsf{Gpd}$ of all groupoids with all morphisms, and the category $\mathsf{Gpd}_\Lambda$ of groupoids over a fixed set of vertices $\Lambda$, with morphisms fixing $\Lambda$.
Famously, the First Isomorphism Theorem fails to hold in $\mathsf{Gpd}$. However, we retrieve here a universally lifted version of the First Isomorphism Theorem in $\mathsf{Gpd}$, through the definition of virtual kernels. In $\mathsf{Gpd}_\Lambda$ instead, a First Isomorphism Theorem is already known from Ávila, Marín, and Pinedo (2020).
Semidirect products of a group by a groupoid are well known. We define crossed products in $\mathsf{Gpd}$, and prove that they are equivalent to split epimorphisms. We observe that in $\mathsf{Gpd}_\Lambda$ crossed products and semidirect products are essentially equivalent, under mild assumptions, and our Split Lemma in $\mathsf{Gpd}$ collapses to a much simpler Split Lemma in $\mathsf{Gpd}_\Lambda$. This latter one, in turn, under some mild extra assumptions, implies a Split Lemma by Ibort and Marmo (2023).

A Chinese restaurant process for multiset permutations
Dudley Stark
Comments:

Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
Multisets are like sets, except that they can contain multiple copies of their elements. If there are $n_i$ copies of $i$, $1\leq i\leq t$, in multiset $M_t$, then there are $\binom{n_1+\cdots+n_t}{n_1,\ldots, n_t}$ possible permutations of $M_t$. Knuth showed how to factor any multiset permutation into cycles. For fixed $n_i$, $i\geq 1$, we show how to adapt the Chinese restaurant process, which generates random permutations on $n$ elements with weighting $\theta^{\# \, {\rm cycles}}$, $\theta>0$, sequentially for $n=1,2,\ldots$, to the multiset case, where we fix the $n_i$ and build permutations on $M_t$ sequentially for $t=1,2,\ldots$. The number of cycles of a multiset permutation chosen uniformly at random, i.e.~$\theta=1$, has distribution given by the sum of independent negative hypergeometric distributed random variables. For all $\theta>0$, and under the assumption that $n_i=O(1)$, we show a central limit theorem as $t\to\infty$ for the number of cycles.

Apart from the connection to percolation, our proofs are more concise and can be followed using only elementary facts from probability. Our argument generalizes some techniques known in the statistical physics community, and we remark on connections to the Eden model.

We consider a perturbation $f$ of a hyperbolic toral automorphism $L$. We study rigidity related to exceptional properties of the strong and weak stable foliations for $f$. If the strong foliation is mapped to the linear one by the conjugacy $h$ between $f$ and $L$, we obtain smoothness of $h$ along the weak foliation and regularity of the joint foliation of the strong and unstable foliations. We also establish a similar global result. If the weak foliation is sufficiently regular, we obtain smoothness of the conjugacy along the strong foliation and regularity of the joint foliation of the weak and unstable foliations. If both conditions hold then we get smoothness of $h$ along the stable foliation. We also deduce a rigidity result for the symplectic case. The main theorems are obtained in a unified way using our new result on relation between holonomes and normal forms.

On Tackling High-Dimensional Nonconvex Stochastic Optimization via Stochastic First-Order Methods with Non-smooth Proximal Terms and Variance Reduction
Yue Xie, Jiawen Bi, Hongcheng Liu
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
When the nonconvex problem is complicated by stochasticity, the sample complexity of stochastic first-order methods may depend linearly on the problem dimension, which is undesirable for large-scale problems. To alleviate this linear dependence, we adopt non-Euclidean settings and propose two choices of nonsmooth proximal terms when taking the stochastic gradient steps. This approach leads to stronger convergence metric, incremental computational overhead, and potentially dimension-insensitive sample complexity. We also consider acceleration through variance reduction which achieves near optimal sample complexity and, to our knowledge, state-of-art in the non-Euclidean setting ($\ell_1/\ell_\infty$). Since the use of nonsmooth proximal terms is unconventional, the convergence analysis deviates much from approaches in Euclidean settings or employing Bregman divergence, providing tools for analyzing other non-Euclidean choices of distance functions. Efficient resolution of the subproblem in various scenarios are also discussed and simulated. We illustrate the dimension-insensitive property of the proposed methods via preliminary numerical experiments.

An Alternating Sign Matrix (ASM) is a square matrix with entries in $\{0,1,-1\}$, and such that: $i)$ in each row and columns, nonzero entries alternate in sign; $ii)$ for any given row or column, entries sum up to 1. We define the frozen-square enumeration as the enumeration of $n\times n$ ASMs under the refinement of having, located in a corner, an $s\times s$ square of entries that are all zeroes. We state a conjectural formula for such enumeration, in terms of a Fredholm type determinant of some $s\times s$ matrix whose entries are given explicitely. We provide numerical support in favour of our conjecture. We also illustrate the relevance of the conjectured formula in connection with the limit shape observed in large ASMs, its fluctuations, and the Tracy--Widom distribution.

Local limit theorems for conditioned random walks by the heat kernel approximation

Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
We study the random walk $(S_n)_{n\geq 1}$ with independent and identically distributed real-valued increments having zero mean and an absolute moment of order $2 + \delta$ for some $\delta > 0$. For any starting point $x \in \mathbb{R}$, let $\tau_x = \inf\{k \geq 1 : x + S_k < 0\}$ denote the first exit time of the random walk $x + S_n$ from the half-line $[0, \infty)$. In the previous work [25], we established a Gaussian heat kernel approximation for both the persistence probability $\mathbb{P}(\tau_x > n)$ and the joint distribution $\mathbb{P}(x + S_n \leq \cdot, \tau_x > n)$, uniformly over $x \in \mathbb{R}$ as $n \to \infty$. In this paper, we leverage these results to establish a novel conditioned local limit theorem for the walk $(x + S_n)_{n \geq 1}$. For $\mathbb{Z}$-valued random walks, we prove that the joint probability $\mathbb{P}(x + S_n = y, \tau_x > n)$ is uniformly approximated by a distribution governed by the Gaussian heat kernel over all $x, y \in \mathbb{Z}$ as $n \to \infty$. Our new asymptotic unifies into a single comprehensive formula the classical local limit theorem by Caravenna [6], as well as various results relying on specific assumptions on $x$ and $y$. As a corollary, we obtain a new uniform-in-$x$ asymptotic formula for the local probability $\mathbb{P}(\tau_x = n)$. We also extend our analysis to non-lattice random walks.

We study the classification of $\mathbb{Z}$-DGAs with polynomial homology $\mathbb{F}_p[x]$ with $\lvert x \rvert >0$, motivated by computations in algebraic $K$-theory. This classification problem was left open in work of Dwyer, Greenlees, and Iyengar. We prove that there are infinitely many such DGAs for even $\lvert x \rvert$ and that for $\lvert x \rvert \geq 2p-2$ any such DGA is formal as a ring spectrum. Through this, we obtain examples of triangulated categories with infinitely many DG-enhancements and a classification of prime DG-division rings.
Combining our results with earlier work of the second author and Tamme, we obtain new (relative) algebraic $K$-theory computations for rings such as the mixed characteristic coordinate axes $\mathbb{Z}[x]/px$ and the group ring $\mathbb{Z}[C_{p^n}]$.

Many algorithms in scientific computing and data science take advantage of low-rank approximation of matrices and kernels, and understanding why nearly-low-rank structure occurs is essential for their analysis and further development. This paper provides a framework for bounding the best low-rank approximation error of matrices arising from samples of a kernel that is analytically continuable in one of its variables to an open region of the complex plane. Elegantly, the low-rank approximations used in the proof are computable by rational interpolation using the roots and poles of Zolotarev rational functions, leading to a fast algorithm for their construction.

Conditions for equality and stability in Shannon's and Tao's entropy power inequalities

Comments:

Subjects:
Probability (math.PR); Information Theory (cs.IT)
We show that there is equality in Shannon's Entropy Power Inequality (EPI) if and only if the random variables involved are Gaussian, assuming nothing beyond the existence of differential entropies. This is done by justifying de Bruijn's identity without a second moment assumption. Part of the proof also relies on a re-examination of an example of Bobkov and Chistyakov (2015), which shows that there exists a random variable $X$ with finite differential entropy $h(X),$ such that $h(X+Y) = \infty$ for any independent random variable $Y$ with finite entropy. We prove that either $X$ has this property, or $h(X+Y)$ is finite for any independent $Y$ that does not have this property. Using this, we prove the continuity of $t \mapsto h(X+\sqrt{t}Z)$ at $t=0$, where $Z \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$ is independent of $X$, under minimal assumptions. We then establish two stability results: A qualitative stability result for Shannon's EPI in terms of weak convergence under very mild moment conditions, and a quantitative stability result in Tao's discrete analogue of the EPI under log-concavity. The proof for the first stability result is based on a compactness argument, while the proof of the second uses the Cheeger inequality and leverages concentration properties of discrete log-concave distributions.

We prove a quantitative mean-field limit in terms of Wasserstein distances under certain conditions on the initial configuration while maintaining control of the particle configuration in the form of the minimal distance and certain singular sums of the particle distances. As a corollary, we show propagation of chaos for $\alpha<\frac{d-1}{2}$ for $d\ge 3$ and $\alpha<\frac 13=\frac{2d-3}{3}$ for $d=2$. This extends the results of Hauray (this https URL), which yield propagation of chaos for $\alpha < \frac{d-2}{2}$ without an assumption on the sign of the interaction. The main novel ingredient is that due to the non-attraction property it is enough to control the distance to the next-to-nearest neighbour particle.

Title:
Semi-simple partition algebras as centralizers of representations for rook monoids

Representation Theory (math.RT); Combinatorics (math.CO)
Let $\mathcal{P}_k(\delta)$, where $k$ is a positive integer and $\delta$ some complex parameter, be the classical partition algebra over the complex numbers. In the case when $\delta=n$, it is well-known that the algebra $\mathcal{P}_k(\delta)$ is the centralizer of the symmetric group $S_n$ acting on the $k$-fold tensor space of the natural representation of $S_n$, for $n\geq 2k$. The algebra $\mathcal{P}_k(\delta)$ is semi-simple for generic values of $\delta$. In this paper, we show that semi-simple partition algebras appear as the centralizer algebras for certain representations of the rook monoids given by an iterative restriction-induction of the trivial representation. Along the way, we also give a decomposition of this iterative representation of the rook monoid into various tensor spaces and show that the corresponding dimensions are given by generalized Bell numbers.

Cross-diffusion limits in multispecies kinetic models
Ansgar Jüngel, Annamaria Pollino, Satoshi Taguchi
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
Cross-diffusion systems are formally derived from multispecies kinetic models in the diffusion limit. The first limit in the multispecies BGK model of Gross and Krook leads to a variant of the non-isothermal Maxwell-Stefan equations. The second limit in a BGK model with Brinkman-type force term yields generalized Busenberg-Travis equations, which reduce for constant temperature to the classical Busenberg-Travis system for segregating population species. Entropy equalities are derived for the kinetic and cross-diffusion equations.

Mixed finite element projection methods for the unsteady Brinkman equations
Costanza Aricò, Rainer Helmig, Ivan Yotov
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
We present $H(\text{div})$-conforming mixed finite element methods for the unsteady Brinkman equations for incompressible single-phase flow with fixed in space porous solid inclusions. We employ a projection scheme with incremental pressure correction, which requires at each time step the solution of a predictor and a projection problem. The predictor problem, which uses a stress-velocity mixed formulation, accounts for the viscous effects, while the projection problem, which is based on a velocity-pressure mixed formulation, accounts for the incompressibility. The spatial discretization is based on the Raviart-Thomas or Brezzi-Douglas-Marini mixed finite element spaces on simplicial grids. The velocity computed at the end of each time step is pointwise divergence-free. Unconditional stability of the fully-discrete scheme and first order in time accuracy are established. Due the $H$(div)-conformity of the formulation, the methods are robust in both the Stokes and the Darcy regimes. In the specific code implementation, we discretize the computational domain using generally unstructured triangular (in 2D) and tetrahedral (in 3D) grids, and we use the Raviart--Thomas space $RT_1$, applying a second order multipoint flux mixed finite element scheme with a quadrature rule that samples the flux degrees of freedom. In the predictor problem this allows for a local elimination of the viscous stress and results in element-based symmetric and positive definite systems for each velocity component with $\left(d+1\right)$ degrees of freedom per simplex (where $d$ is the dimension of the problem). In a similar way, we locally eliminate the corrected velocity in the projection problem, and solve an element-based system for the pressure. A series of challenging numerical experiments is presented to verify the convergence and performance of the proposed scheme

GUE-corners process in two-periodic Aztec diamonds

Subjects:
Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Probability (math.PR)
Links between uniform Aztec diamonds and random matrices are numerous in the literature. In particular \cite{johansson2006eigenvalues,Forrester} established that, under correct rescaling, the probability density function of a certain subclass of dominos converges to the GUE-corners (GUE minor) process in the large size limit. We are interested to see whether this result holds when we modify the probability measure on the space of configurations. In the first part, we look at the case of biased Aztec diamonds, where different weights are associated to vertical and horizontal dominos. In the second part, we examine the case of two-periodic weightings. In both situations, we observe the convergence to GUE-corners with a rescaling that depends on the weighting.

Disconnection probability of Brownian motion on an annulus

Comments:

Subjects:
Probability (math.PR); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
We derive an exact formula for the probability that a Brownian path on an annulus does not disconnect the two boundary components of the annulus. The leading asymptotic behavior of this probability is governed by the disconnection exponent obtained by Lawler-Schramm-Werner (2001) using the connection to Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE). The derivation of our formula is based on this connection and the coupling with Liouville quantum gravity (LQG). As byproducts of our proof, we obtain a precise relation between Brownian motion on a disk stopped upon hitting the boundary and the SLE$_{8/3}$ loop measure on the disk; we also obtain a detailed description of the LQG surfaces cut by the outer boundary of stopped Brownian motion on a $\sqrt{8/3}$-LQG disk.

The crossing number of a graph is the minimum number of crossings over all of its drawings on the plane. The Crossing Lemma, proved more than 40 years ago, is a tight lower bound on the crossing number of a graph in terms of the number of vertices and edges. It is definitely the most important inequality on crossing numbers. We review some generalizations and applications of the Crossing Lemma.

Thom-Milnor bounds for smooth manifolds
Saugata Basu, Antonio Lerario, Matteo Testa
Subjects:
Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Differential Geometry (math.DG)
We prove a smooth analogue of the classical Thom-Milnor bound, showing that the Betti numbers of the zero set of a smooth map on a compact Riemannian manifold can be controlled by a condition number computed from its first jet. This extends previous results in the Euclidean setting by Lerario and Stecconi [J. Singul., 2021]. As a key step, we generalize the Thom-Milnor bound to polynomial maps on a nonsingular real algebraic variety, improving the dependence on the degree. Finally, inspired by the work of Bürgisser, Cucker and Tonelli-Cueto [Found. Comput. Math., 2020], we introduce a condition number for families of functions. Using this we extend existing bounds due to Basu, Pollack and Roy [Proc. Amer. Math. Soc., 2004], for the Betti numbers of semialgebraic sets described by closed conditions to what we call closed semialgebraic type sets, namely sets defined by closed inequalities involving smooth functions.

A more general dependence structure is also investigated. A numerical example illustrates the effect of dependence on the maximum/minimum overlap times.

Multi-Source Neural Activity Indices and Spatial Filters for EEG/MEG Inverse Problem: An Extension to MNE-Python

Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC); Neurons and Cognition (q-bio.NC)
Accurate EEG/MEG source localization is essential for understanding brain function, yet remains challenging because the inverse problem is inherently ill-posed. In spatial filtering (beamforming) approaches, single-source LCMV spatial filters, though widely used, suffer from source cancellation when sources are correlated - a common experimental scenario. Multi-source frameworks, such as the multi-source minimum-variance pseudo-unbiased reduced-rank (MV-PURE) method, offer improved reconstruction and robust neural activity indices, yet their adoption has been limited by incomplete theory and lack of accessible implementations. In this paper, we present a rigorous derivation of multi-source neural activity indices and spatial filters, establishing a complete analytical framework with automated parameter selection. The resulting compact algebraic forms enable straightforward implementation. To facilitate adoption, we provide a full implementation extending MNE-Python, along with an accompanying tutorial, and demonstrate its utility on EEG experimental data, highlighting the practical advantages of multi-source spatial filtering for source localization and reconstruction.

HYCO: Hybrid-Cooperative Learning for Data-Driven PDE Modeling

Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC); Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
We present Hybrid-Cooperative Learning (HYCO), a hybrid modeling framework that iteratively integrates physics-based and data-driven models through a mutual regularization mechanism. Unlike traditional approaches that impose physical constraints directly on synthetic models, HYCO treats the physical and synthetic components as co-trained agents: the physical and synthetic models are nudged toward agreement, while the synthetic model is enhanced to better fit the available data. This cooperative learning scheme is naturally parallelizable and improves robustness to noise as well as to sparse or heterogeneous data. Extensive numerical experiments on both static and time-dependent problems demonstrate that HYCO outperforms classical physics-based and data-driven methods, recovering accurate solutions and model parameters even under ill-posed conditions. The method also admits a natural game-theoretic interpretation, enabling alternating optimization and paving the way for future theoretical developments.

The zero-dispersion limit for the Benjamin--Ono equation on the circle

Using the explicit formula of P. Gérard, we characterize the zero-dispersion limit for solutions of the Benjamin--Ono equation on the circle $\mathbb{T}= \mathbb{R}/2\pi\mathbb{Z}$ with bounded initial data $u_0\in L^\infty(\mathbb{T},\mathbb{R})$. The result generalizes the work of L. Gassot, who focused on periodic bell-shaped data, and complements the work of Gérard and X. Chen who identified the zero-dispersion limit on the line with $u_0\in L^2\cap L^\infty(\mathbb{R})$. Here, as well as in the mentioned cases, the characterization agrees with the one first obtained by Miller--Xu for bell-shaped data on the line: The zero-dispersion limit is given as an alternating sum of the characteristics appearing in the (multivalued) solution of Burgers' equation. From this characterization, we compute regularity properties of the zero-dispersion limit, including maximum principles and an Oleinik estimate.

Randerath {\em et al.} [Discrete Math. 251 (2002) 137-153] proved that every $(P_6,C_3)$-free graph $G$ satisfies $\chi(G)\leq4$. Pyatkin [Discrete Math. 313 (2013) 715-720] proved that every $(2P_3,C_3)$-free graph $G$ satisfies $\chi(G)\leq4$. In this paper, we prove that for a connected $(P_2\cup P_4, C_3)$-free graph $G$, either $G$ has two nonadjacent vertices $u,v$ such that $N(u)\subseteq N(v)$, or $G$ is 3-colorable, or $G$ contains Grőtzsch graph as an induced subgraph and is an induced subgraph of Clebsch graph. Consequently, we have determined the chromatic number of $(P_2\cup P_4, C_3)$-free graph is 4.
A graph $G$ is {\em perfectly divisible} if, for each induced subgraph $H$ of $G$, $V(H)$ can be partitioned into $A$ and $B$ such that $H[A]$ is perfect and $\omega(H[B])<\omega(H)$. A {\em bull} is a graph consisting of a triangle with two disjoint pendant edges. Deng and Chang [Graphs Combin. (2025) 41: 63] proved that every ($P_2\cup P_3$, bull)-free graph $G$ with $\omega(G)\geq3$ has a partition $(X,Y)$ such that $G[X]$ is perfect and $G[Y]$ has clique number less than $\omega(G)$ if $G$ admits no homogeneous set; Chen and Wang [arXiv:2507.18506v2] proved that such property is also true for ($P_2\cup P_4$, bull)-free graphs. In this paper, we prove that a ($P_2\cup P_4$, bull)-free graph is perfectly divisible if and only if it contains no Grőtzsch graph.

Generalized splitting of algebras with application to a bialgebra structure of Leibniz algebras induced from averaging Lie bialgebras
Chengming Bai, Li Guo, Guilai Liu, Quan Zhao
Comments:
29 pages
Subjects:
Quantum Algebra (math.QA); Category Theory (math.CT); Representation Theory (math.RT)
The classical notion of splitting a binary quadratic operad $\mathcal{P}$ gives the notion of pre-$\mathcal{P}$-algebras characterized by $\mathcal{O}$-operators, with pre-Lie algebras as a well-known example. Pre-$\mathcal{P}$-algebras give a refinement of the structure of $\mathcal{P}$-algebras and is critical in the Manin triple approach to bialgebras for $\mathcal{P}$-algebras. Motivated by the new types of splitting appeared in recent studies, this paper aims to extend the classical notion of splitting, by relaxing the requirement that the adjoint actions of the pre-$\mathcal{P}$-algebra form a representation of the $\mathcal{P}$-algebra, to allow also linear combinations of the adjoint actions to form a representation. This yields a whole family of type-$M$ pre-structures, parameterized by the coefficient matrix $M$ of the linear combinations. Using the duals of the adjoint actions gives another family of splittings. Similar generalizations are given to the $\mathcal{O}$-operator characterization of the splitting, and to certain conditions on bilinear forms. Furthermore, this general framework is applied to determine the bialgebra structure induced from averaging Lie bialgebras, lifting the well-known fact that an averaging Lie algebra induces a Leibniz algebra to the level of bialgebras. This is achieved by interpreting the desired bialgebra structure for the Leibniz algebra as the one for a special type-$M$ pre-Leibniz algebra for a suitably chosen matrix $M$ in the above family.

Three interesting cases where our results apply are: (1) divisors on $\mathbb{P}^1 \times \mathbb{P}^1$ of bidegree $(2n,m)$; (2) K3 surfaces which map $2:1$ to $\mathbb{F}_n$, with $X=\mathbb{F}_n$ and $D$ the ramification locus, or (3) elliptic surfaces with either a section or a bisection.
The main tools employed are stable quasimaps, the canonical bundle formula, and the minimal model program.

A numerical scheme for a fully nonlinear free boundary problem
Edgard A. Pimentel, Ercília Sousa
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA); Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
We propose a numerical method to approximate viscosity solutions of fully nonlinear free transmission problems. The method discretises a two-layer regularisation of a PDE, involving a functional and a vanishing parameter. The former is handled via a fixed-point argument. We then prove that the numerical method converges to a one-parameter regularisation of the free boundary problem. Regularity estimates enable us to take the vanishing limit of such a parameter and recover a viscosity solution of the free transmission problem. Our main contribution is the design of a computational strategy, based on fixed-point arguments and approximated problems, to solve fully nonlinear free boundary models. We finish the paper with two numerical examples to validate our method.

Orbital stability of Benjamin--Ono multisolitons

Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
We show that multisoliton solutions to the Benjamin--Ono equation are uniformly orbitally stable in $H^s(\mathbb{R})$ for every $-\tfrac12<s\leq \frac12$. This improves the regularity required for stability up to the sharp well-posedness threshold; previous work (even on single solitons) had required $s\geq \frac12$.
One key ingredient in our argument is a new variational characterization of multisolitons. A second ingredient is the extension to low-regularity slowly-decaying solutions of the Wu identity on eigenfunctions of the Lax operator. This extension also allows us to clarify the spectral type of the Lax operator for such potentials by precluding embedded eigenvalues.

As a corollary, we prove a formula expressing the elementary symmetric expansion of the function \[ \prod_{1\leq i < j \leq d} (z - z_i -z_j) \] in the variables $z_i$ in terms of non-intersecting paths on certain directed graphs, using the Lindström-Gessel-Veinnot Lemma.

In 1959, Erdős and Szekeres posed a series of problems concerning the size of polynomials of the form $$ P_n(z) = \prod_{j=1}^n (1 - z^{s_j}), $$ where $s_1, \dots, s_n$ are positive integers. Of particular interest is the quantity $$ f(n) = \inf_{s_1,\dots,s_n\ge 1} \max_{|z|=1} |P_n(z)|. $$They proved that $\lim_{n\to\infty} f(n)^{1/n} = 1$, and also established the classical lower bound $f(n) \ge \sqrt{2n}$. However, despite extensive effort over more than six decades, no stronger general lower bound had been established.
In this paper, we obtain the new bound $$ f(n) \ge 2\sqrt{n}. $$This gives the first improvement of the classical lower bound for the Erdős--Szekeres problem in the general case since 1959.

For two graphs $G$ and $H$, a mapping $f\colon E(G) \to E(H)$ is an $H$-coloring of $G$, if it is a proper edge-coloring and for every $v \in V(G)$ there exists a vertex $u \in V(H)$ with $f(\partial_G(v))=\partial_H(u)$. Motivated by the Petersen Coloring Conjecture, Mkrtchyan [A remark on the Petersen coloring conjecture of Jaeger, \emph{Australas. J. Combin.}, 56 (2013), 145-151] and Mkrtchyan together with Hakobyan [$S_{12}$ and $P_{12}$-colorings of cubic graphs, \emph{Ars Math. Contemp.}, 17 (2019), 431-445] made the following two conjectures. (I) Every cubic graph has an $S_{10}$-coloring, where $S_{10}$ is a graph on 10 vertices sometimes also referred to as the Sylvester graph. (II) Every cubic graph with a perfect matching has an $S_{12}$-coloring, where $S_{12}$ is the graph obtained from $S_{10}$ by replacing the central vertex with a triangle. In this note we present a (rather small) counterexample to both conjectures.

Whether singularities can form in fluids remains a foundational unanswered question in mathematics. This phenomenon occurs when solutions to governing equations, such as the 3D Euler equations, develop infinite gradients from smooth initial conditions. Historically, numerical approaches have primarily identified stable singularities. However, these are not expected to exist for key open problems, such as the boundary-free Euler and Navier-Stokes cases, where unstable singularities are hypothesized to play a crucial role. Here, we present the first systematic discovery of new families of unstable singularities. A stable singularity is a robust outcome, forming even if the initial state is slightly perturbed. In contrast, unstable singularities are exceptionally elusive; they require initial conditions tuned with infinite precision, being in a state of instability whereby infinitesimal perturbations immediately divert the solution from its blow-up trajectory. In particular, we present multiple new, unstable self-similar solutions for the incompressible porous media equation and the 3D Euler equation with boundary, revealing a simple empirical asymptotic formula relating the blow-up rate to the order of instability. Our approach combines curated machine learning architectures and training schemes with a high-precision Gauss-Newton optimizer, achieving accuracies that significantly surpass previous work across all discovered solutions. For specific solutions, we reach near double-float machine precision, attaining a level of accuracy constrained only by the round-off errors of the GPU hardware. This level of precision meets the requirements for rigorous mathematical validation via computer-assisted proofs. This work provides a new playbook for exploring the complex landscape of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) and tackling long-standing challenges in mathematical physics.

Edge homogenization of Dyson Brownian motion and applications

Probability (math.PR)
We prove a homogenization result for the difference of two coupled Dyson Brownian motions started from generalized Wigner matrix initial data. We prove an optimal order, high probability estimate that is valid throughout the spectrum, including up to the spectral edges. Prior homogenization results concerned only the bulk of the spectrum.
We apply our estimate to address the question of quantifying edge universality. Here, we have two results. We show that the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance of the distribution of the gap between the largest two eigenvalues of a generalized Wigner matrix (with smooth entry distribution) and its GOE/GUE counterpart is $\mathcal{O}(N^{-1+\varepsilon})$. On the other hand, we show that, for the distribution of the largest eigenvalue, there are Wigner matrices so that the analogous Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance is bounded below by $N^{-1/3-\varepsilon}$.

Title:
The Aubin Property for Generalized Equations over $C^2$-cone Reducible Sets
Jiaming Ma, Defeng Sun
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
This paper establishes the equivalence of the Aubin property and the strong regularity for generalized equations over $C^2$-cone reducible sets. This result resolves a long-standing question in variational analysis and extends the well-known equivalence theorem for polyhedral sets to a significantly broader class of non-polyhedral cases. Our proof strategy departs from traditional variational techniques, integrating insights from convex geometry with powerful tools from algebraic topology. A cornerstone of our analysis is a new fundamental lemma concerning the local structure of the normal cone map for arbitrary closed convex sets, which reveals how the dimension of normal cones varies in the neighborhood of a boundary point. This geometric insight is the key to applying degree theory, allowing us to prove that a crucial function associated with the problem has a topological index of $\pm1$. This, via a homological version of the inverse mapping theorem, implies that the function is a local homeomorphism, which in turn yields the strong regularity of the original solution map. This result unifies and extends several existing stability results for problems such as conventional nonlinear programming, nonlinear second-order cone programming, and nonlinear semidefinite programming under a single general framework.

Bellman Optimality of Average-Reward Robust Markov Decision Processes with a Constant Gain
Shengbo Wang, Nian Si
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC); Machine Learning (cs.LG)
Learning and optimal control under robust Markov decision processes (MDPs) have received increasing attention, yet most existing theory, algorithms, and applications focus on finite-horizon or discounted models. The average-reward formulation, while natural in many operations research and management contexts, remains underexplored. This is primarily because the dynamic programming foundations are technically challenging and only partially understood, with several fundamental questions remaining open. This paper steps toward a general framework for average-reward robust MDPs by analyzing the constant-gain setting. We study the average-reward robust control problem with possible information asymmetries between the controller and an S-rectangular adversary. Our analysis centers on the constant-gain robust Bellman equation, examining both the existence of solutions and their relationship to the optimal average reward. Specifically, we identify when solutions to the robust Bellman equation characterize the optimal average reward and stationary policies, and we provide sufficient conditions ensuring solutions' existence. These findings expand the dynamic programming theory for average-reward robust MDPs and lay a foundation for robust dynamic decision making under long-run average criteria in operational environments.

Large deviations for probability graphons

We establish a large deviation principle (LDP) for probability graphons, which are symmetric functions from the unit square into the space of probability measures. This notion extends classical graphons and provides a flexible framework for studying the limit behavior of large dense weighted graphs. In particular, our result generalizes the seminal work of Chatterjee and Varadhan (2011), who derived an LDP for Erdős-Rényi random graphs via graphon theory. We move beyond their binary (Bernoulli) setting to encompass arbitrary edge-weight distributions. Specifically, we analyze the distribution on probability graphons induced by random weighted graphs in which edges are sampled independently from a common reference probability measure supported on a compact Polish space. We prove that this distribution satisfies an LDP with a good rate function, expressed as an extension of the Kullback-Leibler divergence between probability graphons and the reference measure. This theorem can also be viewed as a Sanov-type result in the graphon setting. Our work provides a rigorous foundation for analyzing rare events in weighted networks and supports statistical inference in structured random graph models under distributional edge uncertainty.

Tensor Products with Verma Module and Restriction to Parabolic Subalgebra
Antoine Merceron
Subjects:
Representation Theory (math.RT)
Using the tensor identity, we obtain decomposition results for the tensor product of a generalized Verma module with a module $M$ in the category $\mathcal{O}^{\mathfrak{p}}$, based on the decomposition of the restriction of $M$ to the parabolic subalgebra $\mathfrak{p}$. We show that this restriction admits an essentially unique decomposition into indecomposable $\mathfrak{p}$-modules and identify two particular types of direct summands: finite-dimensional quotients and tilting submodules. Finally, we give the complete $\mathfrak{b}$-decomposition of all indecomposable $M \in \mathcal{O}$ in $\mathfrak{sl}_2$, and of all Verma modules in the block of a dominant integral weight in $\mathfrak{sl}_3$, from which we derive explicit computations.

Friedman's $ \mathsf{WD} $ is not parameter-free sequential
Juvenal Murwanashyaka
Subjects:

Harvey Friedman's $ \mathsf{WD} $ is a weak set theory given by the following non-logical axioms: $ \mathsf{(W)} \; \forall x y \, \exists z \, \forall u \left[ \, u \in z \leftrightarrow ( \, u \in x \; \vee \; u = y \, ) \, \right] $; $ \mathsf{(D)} \; \forall x y \, \exists z \, \forall u \, \left[ \, u \in z \leftrightarrow ( \, u \in x \; \wedge \; u \neq y \, ) \, \right] $. We answer a question raised by Albert Visser which asks whether $ \mathsf{WD} $ is parameter-free sequential. Let $ \mathsf{WD} + \mathsf{EXT} $ denote the theory we obtain by extending $ \mathsf{WD} $ with the axiom of extensionality. We show that $ \mathsf{WD} + \mathsf{EXT} $, and hence also $ \mathsf{WD} $, is not parameter-free sequential by using forcing to construct a model $ \mathcal{V}^{ \star } $ of $ \mathsf{WD} + \mathsf{EXT} $ where $ \left( \mathcal{V}^{ \star } , a \right) \simeq \left( \mathcal{V}^{ \star } , b \right) $ for any two elements $a, b $ of $ \mathcal{V}^{ \star } $.

Adiabatic Klein-Gordon Dynamics for the Renormalized Nelson Model
Morris Brooks, David Mitrouskas
Comments:
63 pages
Subjects:
Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
We study the renormalized Nelson model in a semiclassical regime where the field becomes classical while the particle remains quantum. The degree of classicality is measured by a small parameter $\varepsilon \ll 1$. In this scaling the particle evolves on microscopic times, whereas the field exhibits nontrivial dynamics only on the macroscopic scale $t=\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-2})$. The natural semiclassical model is the coupled Schrödinger-Klein-Gordon (SKG) system, which encodes the time-scale separation through an explicit $\varepsilon$-dependence. Based on this scale separation in SKG, we apply the adiabatic principle to derive a new PDE for the classical field, the $\varepsilon$-free adiabatic Klein-Gordon (aKG) equation, where the field is driven by the instantaneous ground state of the particle. Our main result is a norm approximation of the Nelson dynamics by the aKG solution corrected by a quasi-free fluctuation dynamics around the classical field, generated by a renormalized Bogoliubov-Nelson Hamiltonian. As a corollary, we obtain convergence of the reduced one-body densities for both subsystems, where the fluctuation correction vanishes, thereby justifying aKG as a semiclassical Born-Oppenheimer type approximation of the renormalized Nelson model.

Spacing Test for Fused Lasso
Rieko Tasaka, Tatsuya Kimura, Joe Suzuki
Subjects:
Statistics Theory (math.ST); Machine Learning (cs.LG)
This study addresses the unresolved problem of selecting the regularization parameter in the fused lasso. In particular, we extend the framework of the Spacing Test proposed by Tibshirani et al. to the fused lasso, providing a theoretical foundation for post-selection inference by characterizing the selection event as a polyhedral constraint. Based on the analysis of the solution path of the fused lasso using a LARS-type algorithm, we derive exact conditional $p$-values for the selected change-points. Our method broadens the applicability of the Spacing Test from the standard lasso to fused penalty structures. Furthermore, through numerical experiments comparing the proposed method with sequential versions of AIC and BIC as well as cross-validation, we demonstrate that the proposed approach properly controls the type I error while achieving high detection power. This work offers a theoretically sound and computationally practical solution for parameter selection and post-selection inference in structured signal estimation problems.

We show that, for a Noetherian algebraic stack with quasi-affine diagonal $X$, the stable $\infty$-category of quasi-coherent sheaves on $X$ is dualizable if and only if the reduced identity component of the stabilizer of $X$ at every geometric point of positive characteristic is a torus. Along the way, we show that this condition on stabilizers is also equivalent to an array of other categorical conditions of interest.

Dual Actor DDPG for Airborne STAR-RIS Assisted Communications

Subjects:
Signal Processing (eess.SP); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Information Theory (cs.IT); Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI)
This study departs from the prevailing assumption of independent Transmission and Reflection Coefficients (TRC) in Airborne Simultaneous Transmit and Reflect Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (STAR-RIS) research. Instead, we explore a novel multi-user downlink communication system that leverages a UAV-mounted STAR-RIS (Aerial-STAR) incorporating a coupled TRC phase shift model. Our key contributions include the joint optimization of UAV trajectory, active beamforming vectors at the base station, and passive RIS TRCs to enhance communication efficiency, while considering UAV energy constraints. We design the TRC as a combination of discrete and continuous actions, and propose a novel Dual Actor Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DA-DDPG) algorithm. The algorithm relies on two separate actor networks for high-dimensional hybrid action space. We also propose a novel harmonic mean index (HFI)-based reward function to ensure communication fairness amongst users. For comprehensive analysis, we study the impact of RIS size on UAV aerodynamics showing that it increases drag and energy demand. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DA-DDPG algorithm outperforms conventional DDPG and DQN-based solutions by 24% and 97%, respectively, in accumulated reward. Three-dimensional UAV trajectory optimization achieves 28% higher communication efficiency compared to two-dimensional and altitude optimization. The HFI based reward function provides 41% lower QoS denial rates as compared to other benchmarks. The mobile Aerial-STAR system shows superior performance over fixed deployed counterparts, with the coupled phase STAR-RIS outperforming dual Transmit/Reflect RIS and conventional RIS setups. These findings highlight the potential of Aerial-STAR systems and the effectiveness of our proposed DA-DDPG approach in optimizing their performance.

The accurate calculation of electronic potential energy surfaces for ground and excited states is crucial for understanding photochemical processes, particularly near conical intersections. While classical methods are limited by scaling and quantum algorithms by hardware, this thesis focuses on the State-Averaged Orbital-Optimized Variational Quantum Eigensolver (SA-OO-VQE). This hybrid quantum-classical algorithm provides a balanced description of multiple electronic states by combining quantum state preparation with classical state-averaged orbital optimization.
A key contribution is the implementation and evaluation of the Differential Evolution algorithm within the SA-OO-VQE framework, with a comparative study against classical optimizers like the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) and Sequential Least Squares Programming (SLSQP) algorithms. The performance of these optimizers is assessed by calculating ground and first excited state energies for H$_2$, H$_4$, and LiH.
The thesis also demonstrates SA-OO-VQE's capability to accurately model potential energy surfaces near conical intersections, using formaldimine as a case study. The results show that orbital optimization is essential for correctly capturing the potential energy surface topology, a task where standard methods with fixed orbitals fail. Our findings indicate that while Differential Evolution presents efficiency challenges, gradient-based methods like BFGS and SLSQP offer superior performance, confirming that the SA-OO-VQE approach is crucial for treating complex electronic structures.

Purification of quantum trajectories in infinite dimensions

In this work we exhibit a class of examples that show that the characterization of purification of quantum trajectories in terms of 'dark' subspaces that was proved for finite dimensional systems fails to hold in infinite dimensional ones. Moreover, we prove that the new phenomenon emerging in our class of models and preventing purification to happen is the only new possibility that emerges in infinite dimensional systems. Our proof strategy points out that the emergence of new phenomena in infinite dimensional systems is due to the fact that the set of orthogonal projections is not sequentially compact. Having in mind this insight, we are able to prove that the finite dimensional extends to a class of infinite dimensional models.

Free mutual information and higher-point OTOCs

We introduce a quantity called the free mutual information (FMI), adapted from concepts in free probability theory, as a new physical measure of quantum chaos. This quantity captures the spreading of a time-evolved operator in the space of all possible operators on the Hilbert space, which is doubly exponential in the number of degrees of freedom. It thus provides a finer notion of operator spreading than the well-understood phenomenon of operator growth in physical space. We derive two central results which apply in any physical system: first, an explicit ``Coulomb gas'' formula for the FMI of two observables $A(t)$ and $B$ in terms of the eigenvalues of the product operator $A(t)B$; and second, a general relation expressing the FMI as a weighted sum of all higher-point out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs). This second result provides a precise information-theoretic interpretation for the higher-point OTOCs as collectively quantifying operator ergodicity and the approach to freeness. This physical interpretation is particularly useful in light of recent progress in experimentally measuring higher-point OTOCs. We identify universal behaviours of the FMI and higher-point OTOCs across a variety of chaotic systems, including random unitary circuits and chaotic spin chains, which indicate that spreading in the doubly exponential operator space is a generic feature of quantum many-body chaos. At the same time, the non-generic behavior of the FMI in various non-chaotic systems, including certain unitary designs, shows that there are cases where an operator spreads in physical space but remains localized in operator space. The FMI is thus a sharper diagnostic of chaos than the standard 4-point OTOC.

In this work, we study the identifiability of network topologies for networked nonlinear systems when partial measurements of the nodes are taken. We explore scenarios where different candidate topologies can yield similar measurements, thus limiting identifiability. To do so, we apply the contraction theory framework to facilitate comparisons between candidate topologies. We show that semicontraction in the observable space is a sufficient condition for two systems to become indistinguishable from one another based on partial measurements. We apply this framework to study networks of Kuramoto oscillators, and discuss scenarios in which different topologies (both connected and disconnected) become indistinguishable.

This paper evaluates the impact of three system models on the reference trajectory tracking error of the LQR optimal controller, in the challenging problem of guidance and control of the state of a system under strong perturbations and reconfiguration. We compared a smooth Linear Time Variant system learned from data (DD-LTV) with state of the art Linear Time Variant (LTV) system identification methods, showing its superiority in the task of state propagation. Moreover, we have found that DD-LTV allows for better performance in terms of trajectory tracking error than the standard solutions of a Linear Time Invariant (LTI) system model, and comparable performance to a linearized Linear Time Variant (L-LTV) system model. We tested the three approaches on the perturbed and time varying spring-mass-damper systems.

With the rapid rise of generative AI in higher education and the unreliability of current AI detection tools, developing policies that encourage student learning and critical thinking has become increasingly important. This study examines student use and perceptions of generative AI across three proof-based undergraduate mathematics courses: a first-semester abstract algebra course, a topology course and a second-semester abstract algebra course. In each case, course policy permitted some use of generative AI. Drawing on survey responses and student interviews, we analyze how students engaged with AI tools, their perceptions of generative AI's usefulness and limitations, and what implications these perceptions hold for teaching proof-based mathematics. We conclude by discussing future considerations for integrating generative AI into proof-based mathematics instruction.

This work explores the morphology and dynamical properties of cores within rich superclusters, highlighting their role as transitional structures in the large-scale structure of the Universe. Using projected and radial velocity distributions of member galaxies, we identify cores as dense structures that, despite being gravitationally bound, are not yet dynamically relaxed. However, they exhibit a tendency toward virialisation, evolving in a self-similar manner to massive galaxy clusters but on a larger scale. Morphological analysis reveals that cores are predominantly filamentary, reflecting quasi-linear formation processes consistent with the Zeldovich approximation. Our estimates of the entropy confirm their intermediate dynamical state, with relaxation levels varying across the sample. Mass estimates indicate efficient accretion processes, concentrating matter into gravitationally bound systems. We conclude that cores are important environments where galaxy evolution and hierarchical assembly occur, bridging the gap between supercluster-scale structures and virialised clusters.

We describe a practical approach for accessing the logical failure rates of quantum error-correcting (QEC) circuits under low physical (component) failure rate regimes. Standard Monte Carlo is often the de facto approach for studying the failure rates of quantum circuits. However, in the study of fault-tolerant error-correcting circuits, the ability to extend this approach to low physical failure rates is limited. In particular, the use of Monte Carlo to access circuits that are relatively large or have high correcting power becomes more difficult as we lower the input failure rates of the individual components (gates) in the circuit. For these reasons, many simulations studying the circuit model go no lower than end-to-end logical failure rates in the 10^{-6} regime. In this report, we outline an approach that borrows from earlier work by Bravyi and Vargo to the more complex circuit noise model. Earlier works studied both the capacity and phenomenological noise models, but the work is insufficient for generating similar simulations in the circuit-noise model. To the best of our knowledge, our team is the first to develop a full prescription of the rare event simulation by splitting technique for the circuit-based noise model. We have also generated promising results that are confirmed by standard Monte Carlo simulation under an accessible regime. This work shows that we can access noise in the circuit-model prescription of quantum error-correcting code to failure rates below 10^{-20} regime.

On the universal Casimir spectrum

Comments:
LaTeX, 15 pages
Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
We conjecture the connection between $su$ and $so$ members of universal, in Vogel's sense, multiplets.
The key element is the notion of the {\it vertical componentwise sum} $\oplus_v$ of Young diagrams. Representations in the decomposition of the power of the adjoint representation of $su(N)$ algebra can be parameterized by a couple of $N$-independent Young diagrams $\lambda$ and $\tau$, with equal area. We assume that the $so(N)$ member of the universal (Casimir) multiplet of a given $su(N)$ representation is the $so$ representation with $\lambda \oplus_v \tau$ Young diagram. This allows one to obtain the universal form of the Casimir eigenvalue on that multiplet. Conjecture is checked for all known cases: universal decompositions of powers of adjoint up to fourth, and series of universal representations.
On this basis we suggest the set of universal Casimirs for fifth power of adjoint. We also conjecture that vertical sum operation is a kind of the (dual version of the) folding map of Dynkin diagrams. This will hopefully explain the intrinsic symmetry of universal formulae with respect to the automorphisms of Dynkin diagrams.

LINC: An In-Network Coding Approach to Tame Packet Loss in Hybrid Wireless-Fiber Backbones

Subjects:
Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI); Information Theory (cs.IT)
The emergence of ultra-low latency applications, such as financial transactions, has driven the development of hybrid backbone networks that rely on fiber, satellite, and microwave links. Despite providing low latencies, these hybrid networks suffer from occasional environmental packet loss caused by poor weather, construction, and line of sight blockage. Paradoxically, today's hybrid backbones rely on conventional transport protocols that take packet loss to signal network congestion, as opposed to transient environmental obstacles. A common approach to address this challenge is to use network coding (NC) between the end hosts to recover from these occasional packet loss events. However, current NC proposals assume full access to the end-hosts' stack to perform end-to-end encoding/decoding operations. In this paper, we introduce LINC, a novel system that provides in-network NC capabilities to mitigate environmental packet loss events without requiring cooperation from the end hosts. LINC uses a systematic block coding approach on a link-by-link basis, encoding and decoding packets inside the network. We model the tradeoff in goodput between end-to-end retransmissions and redundant packets introduced by LINC, and propose an optimization formulation to determine the optimal choice of coding parameters. Our simulations on real-world backbone topologies demonstrate that LINC reduces the end-to-end latency by up to 18% by eliminating unnecessary retransmissions.

A Conformal Prediction Framework for Uncertainty Quantification in Physics-Informed Neural Networks
Yifan Yu, Cheuk Hin Ho, Yangshuai Wang
Subjects:
Machine Learning (cs.LG); Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful framework for solving PDEs, yet existing uncertainty quantification (UQ) approaches for PINNs generally lack rigorous statistical guarantees. In this work, we bridge this gap by introducing a distribution-free conformal prediction (CP) framework for UQ in PINNs. This framework calibrates prediction intervals by constructing nonconformity scores on a calibration set, thereby yielding distribution-free uncertainty estimates with rigorous finite-sample coverage guarantees for PINNs. To handle spatial heteroskedasticity, we further introduce local conformal quantile estimation, enabling spatially adaptive uncertainty bands while preserving theoretical guarantee. Through systematic evaluations on typical PDEs (damped harmonic oscillator, Poisson, Allen-Cahn, and Helmholtz equations) and comprehensive testing across multiple uncertainty metrics, our results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves reliable calibration and locally adaptive uncertainty intervals, consistently outperforming heuristic UQ approaches. By bridging PINNs with distribution-free UQ, this work introduces a general framework that not only enhances calibration and reliability, but also opens new avenues for uncertainty-aware modeling of complex PDE systems.

On the geometry of WDVV equations and their Hamiltonian formalism in arbitrary dimension

It is known that in low dimensions WDVV equations can be rewritten as
commuting quasilinear bi-Hamiltonian systems. We extend some of these
results to arbitrary dimension $N$ and arbitrary scalar product $\eta$. In
particular, we show that WDVV equations can be interpreted as a set of linear
line congruences in suitable Plücker embeddings. This form leads to their
representation as Hamiltonian systems of conservation laws. Moreover, we
show that in low dimensions and for an arbitrary $\eta$ WDVV equations can be
reduced to passive orthonomic form. This leads to the commutativity of the
Hamiltonian systems of conservation laws. We conjecture that such a result
holds in all dimensions.

It is shown that the port behavior of a resistor- diode network corresponds to the solution of a ReLU monotone operator equilibrium network (a neural network in the limit of infinite depth), giving a parsimonious construction of a neural network in analog hardware. We furthermore show that the gradient of such a circuit can be computed directly in hardware, using a procedure we call hardware linearization. This allows the network to be trained in hardware, which we demonstrate with a device-level circuit simulation. We extend the results to cascades of resistor-diode networks, which can be used to implement feedforward and other asymmetric networks. We finally show that different nonlinear elements give rise to different activation functions, and introduce the novel diode ReLU which is induced by a non-ideal diode model.

4-uniform Maker-Breaker and Maker-Maker games are PSPACE-complete
Florian Galliot
Subjects:

We study two positional games where two players take turns picking a previously unpicked vertex of a hypergraph $H$. We say a player fills an edge of $H$ if that player has picked all the vertices of that edge. In the Maker-Maker game, whoever first fills an edge wins, or we get a draw if no edge is filled. In the Maker-Breaker game, the first player aims at filling an edge while the second player aims at preventing the first player from filling an edge. We show that, for both games, deciding whether the first player has a winning strategy is a PSPACE-complete problem even when restricted to 4-uniform hypergraphs. For the Maker-Maker game, this improves on a previous result for hypergraphs of rank 4. For the Maker-Breaker game, this improves on a previous result for 5-uniform hypergraphs, and closes the complexity gap as the problem for hypergraphs of rank 3 is known to be solvable in polynomial time.

Searching for collisions in random functions is a fundamental computational problem, with many applications in symmetric and asymmetric cryptanalysis. When one searches for a single collision, the known quantum algorithms match the query lower bound. This is not the case for the problem of finding multiple collisions, despite its regular appearance as a sub-component in sieving-type algorithms.
At EUROCRYPT 2019, Liu and Zhandry gave a query lower bound $\Omega(2^{m/3 + 2k/3})$ for finding $2^k$ collisions in a random function with m-bit output. At EUROCRYPT 2023, Bonnetain et al. gave a quantum algorithm matching this bound for a large range of $m$ and $k$, but not all admissible values. Like many previous collision-finding algorithms, theirs is based on the MNRS quantum walk framework, but it chains the walks by reusing the state after outputting a collision.
In this paper, we give a new algorithm that tackles the remaining non-optimal range, closing the problem. Our algorithm is tight (up to a polynomial factor) in queries, and also in time under a quantum RAM assumption. The idea is to extend the chained walk to a regime in which several collisions are returned at each step, and the ``walks'' themselves only perform a single diffusion layer.

Holdout cross-validation for large non-Gaussian covariance matrix estimation using Weingarten calculus

Cross-validation is one of the most widely used methods for model selection and evaluation; its efficiency for large covariance matrix estimation appears robust in practice, but little is known about the theoretical behavior of its error. In this paper, we derive the expected Frobenius error of the holdout method, a particular cross-validation procedure that involves a single train and test split, for a generic rotationally invariant multiplicative noise model, therefore extending previous results to non-Gaussian data distributions. Our approach involves using the Weingarten calculus and the Ledoit-Péché formula to derive the oracle eigenvalues in the high-dimensional limit. When the population covariance matrix follows an inverse Wishart distribution, we approximate the expected holdout error, first with a linear shrinkage, then with a quadratic shrinkage to approximate the oracle eigenvalues. Under the linear approximation, we find that the optimal train-test split ratio is proportional to the square root of the matrix dimension. Then we compute Monte Carlo simulations of the holdout error for different distributions of the norm of the noise, such as the Gaussian, Student, and Laplace distributions and observe that the quadratic approximation yields a substantial improvement, especially around the optimal train-test split ratio. We also observe that a higher fourth-order moment of the Euclidean norm of the noise vector sharpens the holdout error curve near the optimal split and lowers the ideal train-test ratio, making the choice of the train-test ratio more important when performing the holdout method.

Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface-Assisted Multiuser Tracking and Signal Detection in ISAC

Subjects:
Signal Processing (eess.SP); Information Theory (cs.IT)
This paper investigates the multiuser tracking and signal detection problem in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems with the assistance of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). Due to the diverse and high user mobility, the tracking and signal detection performance can be significantly deteriorated without choreographed user state (position and velocity) updating principle. To tackle this challenge, we manage to establish a comprehensive probabilistic signal model to characterize the interdependencies among user states, transmit signals, and received signals during the tracking procedure. Based on the Bayesian problem formulation, we further propose a novel hybrid variational message passing algorithm for the online estimation of user states, which can iteratively update the posterior probabilities of user states during each tracking frame with computational efficiency. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can significantly improve both of the tracking and signal detection performance over the representative Bayesian estimation counterparts.

Bridging Control Variates and Regression Adjustment in A/B Testing: From Design-Based to Model-Based Frameworks
Yu Zhang, Bokui Wan, Yongli Qin
Subjects:
Methodology (stat.ME); Probability (math.PR)
A B testing serves as the gold standard for large scale, data driven decision making in online businesses. To mitigate metric variability and enhance testing sensitivity, control variates and regression adjustment have emerged as prominent variance reduction techniques, leveraging pre experiment data to improve estimator performance. Over the past decade, these methods have spawned numerous derivatives, yet their theoretical connections and comparative properties remain underexplored. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of their statistical properties, establish a formal bridge between the two frameworks in practical implementations, and extend the investigation from design based to model-based frameworks. Through simulation studies and real world experiments at ByteDance, we validate our theoretical insights across both frameworks. Our work aims to provide rigorous guidance for practitioners in online controlled experiments, addressing critical considerations of internal and external validity. The recommended method control variates with group specific coefficient estimates has been fully implemented and deployed on ByteDance's experimental platform.

eXtended Physics Informed Neural Network Method for Fracture Mechanics Problems

Subjects:
Machine Learning (cs.LG); Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
This paper presents eXtended Physics-Informed Neural Network (X-PINN), a novel and robust framework for addressing fracture mechanics problems involving multiple cracks in fractured media. To address this, an energy-based loss function, customized integration schemes, and domain decomposition procedures are proposed. Inspired by the Extended Finite Element Method (XFEM), the neural network solution space is enriched with specialized functions that allow crack body discontinuities and singularities at crack tips to be explicitly captured. Furthermore, a structured framework is introduced in which standard and enriched solution components are modeled using distinct neural networks, enabling flexible and effective simulations of complex multiple-crack problems in 1D and 2D domains, with convenient extensibility to 3D problems. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.

In this paper, we consider the problem of Gaussian approximation for the online linear regression task. We derive the corresponding rates for the setting of a constant learning rate and study the explicit dependence of the convergence rate upon the problem dimension $d$ and quantities related to the design matrix. When the number of iterations $n$ is known in advance, our results yield the rate of normal approximation of order $\sqrt{\log{n}/n}$, provided that the sample size $n$ is large enough.

Physics-based deep kernel learning for parameter estimation in high dimensional PDEs

Subjects:

Inferring parameters of high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) poses significant computational and inferential challenges, primarily due to the curse of dimensionality and the inherent limitations of traditional numerical methods. This paper introduces a novel two-stage Bayesian framework that synergistically integrates training, physics-based deep kernel learning (DKL) with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) to robustly infer unknown PDE parameters and quantify their uncertainties from sparse, exact observations. The first stage leverages physics-based DKL to train a surrogate model, which jointly yields an optimized neural network feature extractor and robust initial estimates for the PDE parameters. In the second stage, with the neural network weights fixed, HMC is employed within a full Bayesian framework to efficiently sample the joint posterior distribution of the kernel hyperparameters and the PDE parameters. Numerical experiments on canonical and high-dimensional inverse PDE problems demonstrate that our framework accurately estimates parameters, provides reliable uncertainty estimates, and effectively addresses challenges of data sparsity and model complexity, offering a robust and scalable tool for diverse scientific and engineering applications.

Non-universal Thermal Hall Responses in Fractional Quantum Hall Droplets

We analytically compute the thermal Hall conductance (THC) of fractional quantum Hall droplets under realistic conditions that go beyond the idealized linear edge theory with conformal symmetry. Specifically, we consider finite-size effects at low temperature, nonzero self-energies of quasiholes, and general edge dispersions. We derive measurable corrections in THC that align well with the experimental observables. Although the quantized THC is commonly regarded as a topological invariant that is independent of edge confinement, our results show that this quantization remains robust only for arbitrary edge dispersion in the thermodynamic limit. Furthermore, the THC contributed by Abelian modes can become extremely sensitive to finite-size effects and irregular confining potentials in any realistic experimental system. In contrast, non-Abelian modes show robust THC signatures under perturbations, indicating an intrinsic stability of non-Abelian anyons.

Identifying Network Structure of Linear Dynamical Systems: Observability and Edge Misclassification

7 pages, 5 figures, in submission
Subjects:

This work studies the limitations of uniquely identifying a linear network's topology from partial measurements of its nodes. We show that the set of networks that are consistent with the measurements are related through the nullspace of the observability matrix for the true network. In doing so, we illustrate how potentially many networks are fully consistent with the measurements despite having topologies that are structurally inconsistent with each other, an often neglected consideration in the design of topology inference methods. We then provide an aggregate characterization of the space of possible networks by analytically solving for the most structurally dissimilar network. We find that when observing over 6% of nodes in random network models (e.g., Erdős-Rényi and Watts-Strogatz) the rate of edge misclassification drops to ~1%. Extending this discussion, we construct a family of networks that keep measurements $\epsilon$-"close" to each other, and connect the identifiability of these networks to the spectral properties of an augmented observability Gramian.

A Compositional Kernel Model for Feature Learning

Subjects:
Machine Learning (cs.LG); Optimization and Control (math.OC)
We study a compositional variant of kernel ridge regression in which the predictor is applied to a coordinate-wise reweighting of the inputs. Formulated as a variational problem, this model provides a simple testbed for feature learning in compositional architectures. From the perspective of variable selection, we show how relevant variables are recovered while noise variables are eliminated. We establish guarantees showing that both global minimizers and stationary points discard noise coordinates when the noise variables are Gaussian distributed. A central finding is that $\ell_1$-type kernels, such as the Laplace kernel, succeed in recovering features contributing to nonlinear effects at stationary points, whereas Gaussian kernels recover only linear ones.

Quickest Change Detection with Cost-Constrained Experiment Design

Subjects:

In the classical quickest change detection problem, an observer performs only one experiment to monitor a stochastic process. This paper considers the case where, at each observation time, the decision-maker needs to choose between multiple experiments with different information qualities and costs. The goal is to minimize the worst-case average detection delay subject to false alarm and cost constraints. An algorithm called the 2E-CUSUM Algorithm has been developed to achieve this goal for the two-experiment case. Extensions to multiple-experiment designs are also studied, and 2E-CUSUM is extended accordingly. Data efficiency, where the observer has the choice not to perform an experiment, is explored as well. The proposed algorithms are analyzed and shown to be asymptotically optimal.

Gremban Expansion for Signed Networks: Algebraic and Combinatorial Foundations for Community-Faction Detection

Subjects:
Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM); Combinatorics (math.CO); Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph)
This article deals with the characterization and detection of community and faction structures in signed networks. We approach the study of these mesoscale structures through the lens of the Gremban expansion. This graph operation lifts a signed graph to a larger unsigned graph, and allows the extension of standard techniques from unsigned to signed graphs. We develop the combinatorial and algebraic properties of the Gremban expansion, with a focus on its inherent involutive symmetry. The main technical result is a bijective correspondence between symmetry-respecting cut-sets in the Gremban expansion, and regular cut-sets and frustration sets in the signed graph (i.e., the combinatorial structures that underlie communities and factions respectively). This result forms the basis for our new approach to community-faction detection in signed networks, which makes use of spectral clustering techniques that naturally respect the required symmetries. We demonstrate how this approach distinguishes the two mesoscale structures, how to generalize the approach to multi-way clustering and discuss connections to network dynamical systems.

A Variational Framework for Residual-Based Adaptivity in Neural PDE Solvers and Operator Learning

Residual-based adaptive strategies are widely used in scientific machine learning but remain largely heuristic. We introduce a unifying variational framework that formalizes these methods by integrating convex transformations of the residual. Different transformations correspond to distinct objective functionals: exponential weights target the minimization of uniform error, while linear weights recover the minimization of quadratic error. Within this perspective, adaptive weighting is equivalent to selecting sampling distributions that optimize the primal objective, thereby linking discretization choices directly to error metrics. This principled approach yields three benefits: (1) it enables systematic design of adaptive schemes across norms, (2) reduces discretization error through variance reduction of the loss estimator, and (3) enhances learning dynamics by improving the gradient signal-to-noise ratio. Extending the framework to operator learning, we demonstrate substantial performance gains across optimizers and architectures. Our results provide a theoretical justification of residual-based adaptivity and establish a foundation for principled discretization and training strategies.

Understanding how population age structure shapes COVID-19 burden is crucial for pandemic preparedness, yet common summary measures such as median age ignore key distributional features like skewness, bimodality, and the proportional weight of high-risk cohorts. We extend the PoPStat framework, originally devised to link entire population pyramids with cause-specific mortality by applying it to COVID-19. Using 2019 United Nations World Population Prospects age-sex distributions together with cumulative cases and deaths per million recorded up to 5 May 2023 by Our World in Data, we calculate PoPDivergence (the Kullback-Leibler divergence from an optimised reference pyramid) for 180+ countries and derive PoPStat-COVID19 as the Pearson correlation between that divergence and log-transformed incidence or mortality. Optimisation selects Malta's old-skewed pyramid as the reference, yielding strong negative correlations for cases (r=-0.86, p<0.001, R^2=0.74) and deaths (r=-0.82, p<0.001, R^2=0.67). Sensitivity tests across twenty additional, similarly old-skewed references confirm that these associations are robust to reference choice. Benchmarking against eight standard indicators like gross domestic product per capita, Gini index, Human Development Index, life expectancy at birth, median age, population density, Socio-demographic Index, and Universal Health Coverage Index shows that PoPStat-COVID19 surpasses GDP per capita, median age, population density, and several other traditional measures, and outperforms every comparator for fatality burden. PoPStat-COVID19 therefore provides a concise, distribution-aware scalar for quantifying demographic vulnerability to COVID-19.

We consider a generalisation of vector fields on a vector space, where the vector space is generalised to a highest-weight module over a Kac-Moody algebra. The generalised vector field is an element in a non-associative superalgebra defined by the module and the Kac-Moody algebra. Also the Lie derivative of a vector field parameterised by another is generalised and expressed in a simple way in terms of this superalgebra. It reproduces the generalised Lie derivative in the general framework of extended geometry, which in special cases reduces to the one in exceptional field theory, unifying diffeomorphisms with gauge transformations in supergravity theories.

Adaptive Off-Policy Inference for M-Estimators Under Model Misspecification

Methodology (stat.ME); Statistics Theory (math.ST); Machine Learning (stat.ML); Other Statistics (stat.OT)
When data are collected adaptively, such as in bandit algorithms, classical statistical approaches such as ordinary least squares and $M$-estimation will often fail to achieve asymptotic normality. Although recent lines of work have modified the classical approaches to ensure valid inference on adaptively collected data, most of these works assume that the model is correctly specified. We propose a method that provides valid inference for M-estimators that use adaptively collected bandit data with a (possibly) misspecified working model. A key ingredient in our approach is the use of flexible machine learning approaches to stabilize the variance induced by adaptive data collection. A major novelty is that our procedure enables the construction of valid confidence sets even in settings where treatment policies are unstable and non-converging, such as when there is no unique optimal arm and standard bandit algorithms are used. Empirical results on semi-synthetic datasets constructed from the Osteoarthritis Initiative demonstrate that the method maintains type I error control, while existing methods for inference in adaptive settings do not cover in the misspecified case.

Data Denoising and Derivative Estimation for Data-Driven Modeling of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems

Subjects:
Machine Learning (cs.LG); Dynamical Systems (math.DS); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph)
Data-driven modeling of nonlinear dynamical systems is often hampered by measurement noise. We propose a denoising framework, called Runge-Kutta and Total Variation Based Implicit Neural Representation (RKTV-INR), that represents the state trajectory with an implicit neural representation (INR) fitted directly to noisy observations. Runge-Kutta integration and total variation are imposed as constraints to ensure that the reconstructed state is a trajectory of a dynamical system that remains close to the original data. The trained INR yields a clean, continuous trajectory and provides accurate first-order derivatives via automatic differentiation. These denoised states and derivatives are then supplied to Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) to recover the governing equations. Experiments demonstrate effective noise suppression, precise derivative estimation, and reliable system identification.

The arithmetic of simplices

Comments:

Subjects:
General Mathematics (math.GM)
This paper continues the study initiated in "The aithmetic of Triangles." We begin by examining a set of similar tetrahedra with parallel sides, together with a set of points in three-dimensional space. It turns out that the set
$\mathbb{R}_3= \{\pm <x >=\pm (x^3,x^2,x,1); x\in\mathbb{R} \}$ effectively characterizes this family of tetrahedra. The set $\mathbb{R}_3$ is a subset of the ring
$\mathbb{R}^4 = \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} = \{ (x, y, z, w) ; x, y, z, w \in \mathbb{R} \}$,
with addition and multiplication defined component-wise. The set $\mathbb{R}_3$ supports two operations. Multiplication is inherited directly from the ring $\mathbb{R}^4$, while addition is a four-argument operation that reflects geometric transformations such as homothety and translation of elements in $\mathbb{R}_3$.
A novel form of addition in $\mathbb{R}_3$ leads to intriguing properties of multiplication in $\mathbb{R}_3$, which are examined in a dedicated chapter.
We then generalize this approach to sets of $k$-dimensional similar simplices with parallel sides, along with corresponding sets of points in $k$-dimensional space.

Arithmetic of triangles

Subjects:
Metric Geometry (math.MG); Combinatorics (math.CO)
In this paper, we consider a set of similar triangles with parallel sides, along with a set of points in the plane. It turns out that the set $\mathbb{R}_2= \{\pm <x >=\pm (x^2,x,1); x\in\mathbb{R} \}$ describes this set of triangles quite well. The set $\mathbb{R}_2$ is a subset of the ring $\mathbb{R}^3=\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}= \{ (x,y,z) ; x,y,z\in\mathbb{R} \}$ with addition and multiplication defined coordinate-wise.
The set $\mathbb{R}_2$ is equipped with two operations. Multiplication is inherited from the ring $\mathbb{R}^3$, while addition is a ternary operation that represents homothety and translation of elements in $\mathbb{R}_2$.
However, the defined addition has its limitations. It turns out that, within this framework, the reduction of terms with different signs is not always possible. This leads to the distinction between an equation that is true in the arithmetic sense and one that is true in the geometric sense.
A novel form of addition in $\mathbb{R}_2$ leads to intriguing properties of multiplication in $\mathbb{R}_2$, which are examined in a dedicated chapter.
In the next section we use the construction of adding to describe the dissection of the triangle into 15 triangles of different sides.
In the final two sections, we consider a set of two kinds of vectors, along with a set of points on the line. The set $\mathbb{R}_1= \{\pm <x >=\pm (x,1); x\in\mathbb{R} \}$ describes this set vectors quite well and it is a one-dimensional reduction of the set $\mathbb{R}_2$.

Subjects:

We present generalizations of the Newton-Raphson-Simpson method. Specifically, for a positive integer $m$ and the sequence of coefficients of a Taylor series of a function $f(z)$, we define an algorithm we denote by NRS($m$) which is a way to evaluate, in our terminology, a sum of $m$ formal zeros of $f(z)$. We prove that NRS(1) yields the familiar iterations of the Newton-Raphson-Simpson method. We also prove that NRS($m$) is way to evaluate certain $\mathscr{A}$-hypergeometric series defined by Sturmfels. In order to define these algorithms, we make use of combinatorial objects which we call trees with negative vertex degree.

We study isolated quotient singularities by finite and linearly reductive group schemes (lrq singularities for short) and show that they satisfy many, but not all, of the known properties of finite quotient singularities in characteristic zero:
(1) From the lrq singularity we can recover the group scheme and the quotient presentation.
(2) We establish canonical lifts to characteristic zero, which leads to a bijection between lrq singularities and certain characteristic zero counterparts.
(3) We classify subgroup schemes of ${\mathbf{GL}}_d$ and ${\mathbf{SL}}_d$ that correspond to lrq singularities. For $d=2$, this generalises results of Klein, Brieskorn, and Hashimoto. Also, our classification is closely related to the spherical space form problem.
(4) F-regular (resp. F-regular and Gorenstein) surface singularities are precisely the lrq singularities by finite and linearly reductive subgroup schemes of ${\mathbf{GL}}_2$ (resp. ${\mathbf{SL}}_2$). This generalises results of Klein and Du Val.
(5) Lrq singularities in dimension $\geq 4$ are infinitesimally rigid. We classify lrq singularities in dimension $3$ that are not infinitesimally rigid and compute their deformation spaces. This generalises Schlessinger's rigidity theorem to positive and mixed characteristic.
Finally, we study Riemenschneider's conjecture in this context, that is, whether lrq singularities deform to lrq singularities.

The Riemannian hemisphere is almost calibrated in the injective hull of its boundary

An exact differential two-form is constructed in the injective hull of the Riemannian circle, whose comass norm, defined via the inscribed Riemannian area on normed planes, is stationary at every point of the open hemisphere spanned by the circle. As a consequence, in any metric space, the induced Finsler mass of a two-dimensional Ambrosio-Kirchheim rectifiable current with boundary a Riemannian circle of length $2\pi$ admits a lower bound of $2\pi$ plus a second-order term in the Hausdorff distance to an isometric copy of the hemisphere. This estimate applies to all oriented Lipschitz surfaces spanning the circle, regardless of their topology, and thus offers positive evidence for Gromov's filling area conjecture.

The BKK theorem states that the mixed volume of the Newton polytopes of a system of polynomial equations upper bounds the number of isolated torus solutions of the system. Homotopy continuation solvers make use of this fact to pick efficient start systems. For systems where the mixed volume bound is not attained, such methods are still tracking more paths than necessary. We propose a strategy of improvement by lifting a system to an equivalent system with a strictly lower mixed volume at the expense of more variables. We illustrate this idea providing lifting constructions for arbitrary bivariate systems and certain dense-enough systems.

We compute the cohomology ring $H^*(U,\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})$ for $U=X\setminus S$ where $X$ is the spectrum of the ring of integers of a number field $K$ and $S$ is a finite set of finite primes. As a consequence, we obtain an efficient way to compute presentations of $Q_2(G_S)$, where $G_S$ is Galois group of the maximal extension of $K$ unramified outside of a finite set of primes $S$, for varying $K$. This includes the following cases (for $p$ any prime dividing $n$): $\mu_p(\overline{K}) \not\subseteq K$; $S$ does not contain the primes above $p$; and $p=2$ with $K$ admitting real archimedean places. We also show how to recover the classical reciprocity law of the Legendre symbol from the graded commutativity of the cup product.

Title:
Torsors over the Rational Double Points in Characteristic $\mathbf{p}$

Comments:
81 pages, final version
Subjects:

We study torsors under finite group schemes over the punctured spectrum of a singularity $x\in X$ in positive characteristic.
We show that the Dieudonné module of the (loc,loc)-part $\mathrm{Picloc}^{\mathrm{loc},\mathrm{loc}}_{X/k}$ of the local Picard sheaf can be described in terms of local Witt vector cohomology, making $\mathrm{Picloc}^{\mathrm{loc},\mathrm{loc}}_{X/k}$ computable. Together with the class group and the abelianised local étale fundamental group, $\mathrm{Picloc}^{\mathrm{loc},\mathrm{loc}}_{X/k}$ completely describes the finite abelian torsors over $X\setminus\{x\}$.
We compute $\mathrm{Picloc}^{\mathrm{loc},\mathrm{loc}}_{X/k}$ for every rational double point singularity, which complements results of Artin and Lipman, who determined ${\pi_{\mathrm{loc}}^{\mathrm{et}}}(X)$ and ${\rm Cl}(X)$. All three objects turn out to be finite.
We extend the Flenner--Mumford criterion for smoothness of a normal surface germ $x \in X$ to perfect fields of positive characteristic, generalising work of Esnault and Viehweg: If $k$ is algebraically closed, then $X$ is smooth if and only if $\mathrm{Picloc}^{\mathrm{loc},\mathrm{loc}}_{X/k}$, ${\pi_{\mathrm{loc}}^{\mathrm{et}}}(X)$, and ${\rm Cl}(X)$ are trivial.
Finally, we study the question whether rational double point singularities are quotient singularities by group schemes and if so, whether the group scheme is uniquely determined by the singularity. We give complete answers to both questions, except for some $D_n^r$-singularities in characteristic $2$. In particular, we will give examples of (F-injective) rational double points that are not quotient singularities.

Elliptic differential-operator with an abstract Robin boundary condition containing two spectral parameters, study in a non commutative framework

We study the solvability of boundary-value problems for differential-operator equations of the second order in L p (0, 1; X), with 1 < p < +$\infty$, X being a UMD complex Banach space. The originality of this work lies in the fact that we have considered the case when spectral complex parameters appear in the equation and in the abstract Robin boundary condition illustrated by some unbounded operator non commuting with the one used in the equation. Existence, uniqueness, representation formula, maximal regularity of the solution, sharp estimates and generation of strongly continuous analytic semigroup are proved. Many concrete applications are given for which our theory applies. This work gives news considerations with respect to all those studied by the authors in [7] and is a continuation, in some sense, of the results in [1] studied in Hilbertian spaces.

Title:
The infinite information gap between mathematical and physical representations
Pedro Hack, Daniel A. Braun, Sebastian Gottwald
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO); Information Theory (cs.IT); Theoretical Economics (econ.TH)
Partial orders have been used to model several experimental setups, going from classical thermodynamics and general relativity to the quantum realm with its resource theories. In order to study such experimental setups, one typically characterizes them via a (numerical) representation, that is, a set of real-valued functions. In the context of resource theory, it is customary to use \textbf{mathematical} representations, i.e. a set of \textbf{measurement outcomes} which characterize the achievable transitions within the experimental setup. However, in line with the minimum energy and maximum entropy principles in classical mechanics and thermodynamics, respectively, one would expect an optimization interpretation for a representation to be called \textbf{physical}. More specifically, a physical representation could consist of a set of competing \textbf{optimization principles} such that a transition happens provided they are all optimized by it. Somewhat surprisingly, we show that this distinction can result in an \textbf{infinite information gap}, with some partial orders having mathematical representations that involve a finite amount of information and requiring infinite information to build a physical representation. We connect this phenomenon with well-known resource-theoretic scenarios like majorization, and develop notions of partial order dimension that run in parallel to the representations that we consider. Our results improve on the classification of preordered spaces in terms of real-valued functions.

Global existence and pointwise decay for nonlinear waves under the null condition

Comments:

Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
This paper proves global existence and sharp pointwise decay for solutions to nonlinear wave equations satisfying the semilinear null condition, on a class of three-dimensional, asymptotically flat, and notably, non-stationary spacetimes. We consider nonlinearities satisfying a generalized null condition which does not necessarily retain its structure when commuted with vector fields. For sufficiently small initial data, and under the assumption that the underlying linear operator satisfies an integrated local energy decay estimate, we prove that solutions exist for all time and we establish sharp pointwise decay estimates for the solution $\phi$ and its vector-fields. The solution itself decays as $|\phi(t,x)| \lesssim \langle t+r \rangle^{-1} \langle t-r \rangle^{-1}$. This rate matches that of the nonlinear equation on a flat background. This rate is sharp, as this behavior holds already for certain time-dependent perturbations of the classical null form on Minkowski space, which we specify.

On the large-time behaviour of affine Volterra processes

Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
We show the existence of a stationary measure for a class of multidimensional stochastic Volterra systems of affine type. These processes are in general not Markovian, a shortcoming which hinders their large-time analysis. We circumvent this issue by lifting the system to a measure-valued stochastic evolution equation introduced by Cuchiero and Teichmann~\cite{CT18}, whence we retrieve the Markov property. Leveraging on the associated generalised Feller property, we extend the Krylov-Bogoliubov theorem to this infinite-dimensional setting and thus establish an approach to the existence of invariant measures. We present concrete examples, including the rough Heston model from Mathematical Finance.

Bernstein-Szegő measures in the plane
Jeffrey S. Geronimo, Plamen Iliev
Subjects:
Classical Analysis and ODEs (math.CA); Complex Variables (math.CV); Functional Analysis (math.FA)
We define a class of Bernstein-Szegő measures on $\mathbb{R}^2$ and we establish their spectral properties, providing a natural extension of the one-dimensional theory. We also derive conditions involving finitely many moments, which are new in the two-dimensional setting, and which completely characterize these measures. A key ingredient in the theory on the real line stems from the fact that a measure $\mu$ on $\mathbb{R}$ determines a unique sequence of orthonormal polynomials which gives a simple formula for $d\mu/dx $ in the Bernstein-Szegő family. Since there is no canonical way to introduce orthonormal polynomials in the plane, our extension is based on a new identity which connects a Fejér-Riesz factorization of the weight to a polynomial depending on three variables associated with $\mu$. Using recent results in the bivariate trigonometric Fejér-Riesz factorization problem, we define a nontrivial two-dimensional extension of the Szegő mapping which provides explicit orthonormal bases of the spaces associated with Bernstein-Szegő measures on $\mathbb{R}^2$. An important part of the paper is devoted to a self-contained development of the Bernstein-Szegő theory for matrix-valued functionals. The proofs combine techniques from real analysis, complex analysis and algebra.

Based thereon, we show how to identify the polynomial and rational solutions of a polynomial equation.

A birational involution

Subjects:

Given a general K3 surface S of degree 18, lattice theoretic considerations allow to predict the existence of an anti-symplectic birational involution \phi of the Hilbert cube S^[3]. We describe this involution in terms of the Mukai model of S, with the help of the famous transitive action of the exceptional group G\_2(R) on the six-dimensional sphere. We make a connection with Homological Projective Duality by showing that the indeterminacy locus of the involution is birational to a P^2-bundle over the dual K3 surface of degree two. We deduce that \phi is an instance of a Mukai flop.

We develop a framework of parametrized semiadditivity and stability with respect to so-called atomic orbital subcategories of an indexing $\infty$-category $T$, extending work of Nardin. Specializing this framework, we introduce global $\infty$-categories and the notions of equivariant semiadditivity and stability, yielding a higher categorical version of the notion of a Mackey 2-functor studied by Balmer-Dell'Ambrogio. As our main result, we identify the free presentable equivariantly stable global $\infty$-category with a natural global $\infty$-category of global spectra for finite groups, in the sense of Schwede and Hausmann.

We prove that this phenomenon holds for simplicial and hyperoctahedral families of Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in $n$ dimensions, in which case the Frobenius matrix entries are rational linear combinations of products of $\zeta_p(k)$ with $1 < k < n$.

Theory 20, (2016)] we realize the enveloping algebra of the positive part of an affine Kac-Moody Lie algebra of Dynkin type $\tilde{\mathsf{C}}_n$ as a generalized composition algebra of constructible functions on the varieties of locally free representations of the corresponding 1-Iwanaga-Gorenstein algebra $H=H_{\mathbb{C}}(C,D,\Omega)$ with minimal symmetrizer $D$ and arbitrary orientation $\Omega$. To this end, we exploit in several ways the fact that in this situation $H$ is a string algebra.

There are two frameworks for mating Kleinian groups with rational maps on the Riemann sphere: the algebraic correspondence framework due to Bullett-Penrose-Lomonaco \cite{BP94,BL20} and the simultaneous uniformization mating framework of \cite{MM23a}. The current paper unifies and generalizes these two frameworks. To achieve this, we extend the mating framework of \cite{MM23a} to genus zero hyperbolic orbifolds with at most one orbifold point of order $\nu \geq 3$ and at most one orbifold point of order two. We give an explicit description of the resulting conformal matings in terms of uniformizing rational maps. Using these rational maps, we construct correspondences that are matings of such hyperbolic orbifold groups (including punctured spheres and Hecke groups) with polynomials in real-symmetric hyperbolic components. We also define an algebraic parameter space of correspondences and construct an analog of a Bers slice of the above orbifolds in this parameter space.

We prove that Brinkmann's problems are decidable for endomorphisms of $F_n\times F_m$: given $(x,y),(z,w)\in F_n\times F_m$ and $\Phi\in \text{End}(F_n\times F_m)$, it is decidable whether there is some $k\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $(x,y)\Phi^k=(z,w)$ (or $(x,y)\Phi^k\sim(z,w)$). We also prove decidability of a two-sided version of Brinkmann's conjugacy problem for injective endomorphisms which, from the work of Logan, yields a solution to the conjugacy problem in ascending HNN-extensions of $F_n\times F_m$. Finally, we study the dynamics of automorphisms of $F_n\times F_m$ at the infinity, proving that that their dynamics at the infinity is asymptotically periodic, as occurs in the free and free-abelian times free cases.

Let $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}:=(\Sigma,\mathbb{M},\mathbb{P})$ be a surface with marked points $\mathbb{M}\subset\partial\Sigma\neq\varnothing$ on the boundary, and punctures $\mathbb{P}\subset\Sigma\setminus\partial\Sigma$, and $T$ an arbitrary tagged triangulation of $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$ in the sense of Fomin-Shapiro-Thurston. The Jacobian algebra $A(T):=\mathcal{P}(Q(T), W(T))$ corresponding to the non-degenerate potential $W(T)$ defined by Cerulli Irelli and the second author is tame, as shown by Schröer and the first two authors. In this paper, we show that there is a natural isomorphism $\pi_T:\operatorname{Lam}(\boldsymbol{\Sigma})\rightarrow\operatorname{DecIrr}^\tau(A(T))$ of tame partial KRS-monoids that intertwines dual shear coordinates with respect to $T$, and generic $g$-vectors of irreducible components. Here, $\operatorname{Lam}(\boldsymbol{\Sigma})$ is the set of laminations of $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$ considered by Musiker-Schiffler-Williams, with the disjoint union of non-intersecting laminations as partial monoid operation. On the other hand, $\operatorname{DecIrr}^\tau(A(T))$ denotes the set of generically $\tau$-regular irreducible components of the decorated representation varieties of $A(T)$, with the direct sum of generically $E$-orthogonal irreducible components as partial monoid operation, where $E$ is the symmetrized $E$-invariant of Derksen-Weyman-Zelevinsky, $E(-,\bullet)=\dim\operatorname{Hom}_{A(T)}(-,\tau(\bullet))+\dim\operatorname{Hom}_{A(T)}(\bullet,\tau(-))$.

Optimality Conditions for Multivariate Chebyshev Approximation: A Survey
Alexandre Goldsztejn (LS2N, LS2N - équipe OGRE)
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA); Optimization and Control (math.OC)
Uniform polynomial approximation, also called minimax approximation or Chebyshev approximation, consists in searching polynomial approximation that minimizes the worst case error. Optimality conditions for the uniform approximation of univariate functions defined in an interval are governed by the equioscillation theorem, which is also a key ingredient in algorithms for computing best uniform approximation, like Remez's algorithm and the two phase method. Multivariate polynomial approximation is more complicated, and several optimality conditions for uniform multivariate polynomial approximation generalize the equioscillation theorem. We review these conditions, including, from oldest to newest, Kirchberger's kernel condition, Kolmogorov criteria, Rivlin and Shapiro's annihilating measures. An emphasis is given to conditions for strong optimality, which has some strong theoretical and practical importance, including Bartelt's and Smarzewsky's conditions. Optimality conditions related to more general relative Chebyshev centers are also presented, including Tanimoto's and Levis et al.'s conditions. In a second step, conditions obtained by standard convex analysis, subdifferential and directional derivative, applied to uniform approximation are formulated. Their relationship to previous conditions is investigated, providing sometimes enlightening interpretations of the laters, e.g., relating Kolmogorov criterion with directional derivative, and strong uniqueness with sharp minimizers. Finally, numerical applications of the two-step approach to three uniform approximation problems are presented, namely the approximation of the multidimensional Runge function, the approximation of the two dimensional inverse model of the DexTAR parallel robot, and the approximation problem consisting in minimizing the sum of both the polynomial approximation error and the polynomial evaluation error in Horner form.

We study complex Lagrangians in Hitchin systems that factor through a proper subvariety of the Hitchin base non-trivially intersecting the regular locus. This gives a general framework for several examples in the literature. We compute the fiber-wise Fourier-Mukai transform of flat line bundles on visible Lagrangians. This proposes a construction of mirror dual branes to visible Lagrangians. Finally, we study a new example of visible Lagrangians in detail. Such visible Lagrangian exists whenever the underlying Riemann surface is a pillowcase cover. The proposed mirror dual brane turns out to be closely related to Hausel's toy model.

Cilleruelo conjectured that for an irreducible polynomial $f \in \mathbb{Z}[X]$ of degree $d \geq 2$, denoting $$L_f(N)=\mathrm{lcm}(f(1),f(2),\ldots f(N))$$ one has $$\log L_f(n)\sim(d-1)N\log N.$$ He proved it in the case $d=2$ but it remains open for every polynomial with $d>2$.
While the tight upper bound $\log L_f(n)\lesssim (d-1)N\log N$ is known, the best known general lower bound due to Sah is $\log L_f(n)\gtrsim N\log N.$
We give an improved lower bound for a special class of irreducible polynomials, which includes the decomposable irreducible polynomials $f=g\circ h,\,g,h\in\mathbb Z[x],\mathrm{deg}\, g,\mathrm{deg}\, h\ge 2$, for which we show $$\log L_f(n)\gtrsim \frac{d-1}{d-\mathrm{deg}\, g}N\log N.$$
We also improve Sah's lower bound $\log\ell_f(N)\gtrsim \frac 2dN\log N$ for the radical $\ell_f(N)=\mathrm{rad}(L_f(N))$ for all $f$ with $d\ge 3$ and give a further improvement
for polynomials $f$ with a small Galois group and satisfying an additional technical condition, as well as for decomposable polynomials.

Age of Gossip in Random and Bipartite Networks

In this paper we study gossip networks where a source observing a process sends updates to an underlying graph. Nodes in the graph communicate to their neighbors by randomly sending updates. Our interest is studying the version age of information (vAoI) metric over various classes of networks. It is known that the version age of $K_n$ is logarithmic, and the version age of $\overline{K_n}$ is linear. We study the question `how does the vAoI evolve as we interpolate between $K_n$ and $\overline{K_n}$' by studying Erdős-Reyni random graphs, random $d$-regular graphs, and bipartite networks. Our main results are proving the existence of a threshold in $G(n,p)$ from rational to logarithmic average version age, and showing $G(n,d)$ almost surely has logarithmic version age for constant $d$. We also characterize the version age of complete bipartite graphs $K_{L,R}$, when we let $L$ vary from $O(1)$ to $O(n)$.

In this paper, we consider the well-posedness of stochastic S-KdV driven by multiplicative noises in $H_x^1\times H_x^1$. To get the local well-posedness, we first develop the bilinear and trilinear Bourgain norm estimates of the nonlinear terms with $b\in\left(0,1/2\right)$. Then, to overcome regularity problems, we introduce a series of approximation equations with localized nonlinear terms, which are also cutted-off in both the physical and the frequency space. By limitations, these approximation equations will help us get a priori estimate in the Bourgain space and finish the proof of the global well-posedness of the initial system.

The distribution of the properly renormalized gaps of $\sqrt{n} \,\mathrm{mod}\, 1$ with $n < N$ converges (when $N\rightarrow \infty$) to a non-standard limit distribution, as Elkies and McMullen proved in 2004 using techniques from homogeneous dynamics. In this paper we give an essentially self-contained proof based on the circle method. Our main innovation consists in showing that a new type of correlation functions of $\sqrt{n} \,\mathrm{mod}\, 1$ converge. To define these correlation functions we restrict, smoothly, to those $\sqrt{n} \,\mathrm{mod}\, 1$ that lie in minor arcs, i.e. away from rational numbers with small denominators.

Given a connection $A$ on a $SU(2)$-bundle $P$ over $\mathbb{R}^4$ with finite Yang-Mills energy $YM(A)$ and nonzero curvature $F_A(0)$ at the origin, and given $\rho>0$ small enough, we construct a new connection $\hat A$ on a bundle $\hat P$ of different Chern class ($|c_2(A)-c_2(\hat A)|=8\pi^2$), in such a way that $\hat A$ is gauge equivalent to $A$ in $\mathbb{R}^4\setminus B_\rho(0)$, gauge equivalent to an instanton in a smaller ball $B_{\tau \rho}(0)$, and $$YM(\hat A)\le YM(A)+8\pi^2-\varepsilon_0\rho^4|F_A(0)|^2,$$ where $\tau\in (0.3,0.4)$ and $\varepsilon_0>0$ are universal constant independent of $A$ and $\rho$. Our gluing method is similar in spirit to the one of Brezis-Coron for harmonic maps. We compare it with classical results by Taubes and discuss applications and open problems.

We prove in this paper that the solution of the time-dependent Schr{ö}dinger equation can be expressed as the solution of a global space-time quadratic minimization problem that is amenable to Galerkin time-space discretization schemes, using an appropriate least-square formulation. The present analysis can be applied to the electronic many-body time-dependent Schr{ö}dinger equation with an arbitrary number of electrons and interaction potentials with Coulomb singularities. We motivate the interest of the present approach with two goals: first, the design of Galerkin space-time discretization methods; second, the definition of dynamical low-rank approximations following a variational principle different from the classical Dirac-Frenkel principle, and for which it is possible to prove the global-in-time existence of solutions.

We first revisit these results in the context of Sobolev spaces modelled on L^2 and then explore the endpoint Besov case B\_{p,1}^{d/p}. We also exemplify our method on the SKT system, showing the existence of local, non-negative, strong solutions.

Rudin's version of the classical Julia-Wolff-Carathéodory theorem is a cornerstone of holomorphic function theory in the unit ball of $\mathbb{C}^d$. In this paper we obtain a complete generalization of Rudin's theorem for a holomorphic map $f\colon D\to D'$ between convex domains of finite type. In particular, given a point $\xi\in \partial D$ with finite dilation we show that the $K$-limit of $f$ at $\xi$ exists and is a point $\eta\in \partial D'$, and we obtain asymptotic estimates for all entries of the Jacobian matrix of the differential $df_z$ in terms of the multitypes at the points $\xi$ and at $\eta$. We introduce a generalization of Bracci-Patrizio-Trapani's pluricomplex Poisson kernel which, together with the dilation at $\xi$, gives a formula for the restricted $K$-limit of the normal component of the normal derivative $\langle df_z(n_\xi),n_\eta\rangle$. Our principal tools are methods from Gromov hyperbolicity theory, a scaling in the normal direction, and the strong asymptoticity of complex geodesics. To obtain our main result we prove a conjecture by Abate on the Kobayashi type of a vector $v$, proving that it is equal to the reciprocal of the line type of $v$, and we give new extrinsic characterizations of both $K$-convergence and restricted convergence to a point $\xi\in \partial D$ in terms of the multitype at $\xi$.

Loop percolation versus link percolation in the random loop model
Volker Betz, Andreas Klippel, Mino Nicola Kraft
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
In [Muhl2019], Peter Mühlbacher showed that in the random loop model without loop weights, a loop phase transition (assuming it exists) cannot occur at the same parameter as the percolation phase transition of the occupied edges. In this work, we give a quantitative version of this result, specifying a minimal gap between the percolation phase transition and a possible loop phase transition. A substantial part of our argument also works for weighted loop models.

Nearly invariant subspaces and kernels of Toeplitz operators on the Hardy space over the bidisk
Senhua Zhu, Yuxia Liang
Comments:

Subjects:
Functional Analysis (math.FA)
In this paper, the analysis of nearly invariant subspaces and kernels of Toeplitz operators on the Hardy space over the bidisk is developed. Firstly, we transcribe Chalendar, Chevrot and Partington's result to vector-valued Hardy space $H^{2}_{\ma{H}}(\mathbb{D})$ when $\ma{H}$ is an infinite dimensional separable complex Hilbert space. Secondly, we explore the definition of nearly invariant subspaces on Hardy space over the bidisk, and apply it to characterize kernels of Toeplitz operators. Finally, we define the nearly invariant subspaces for commutative isometric tuples, which allows us to show that the kernel of general Toeplitz operators is also nearly invariant.

Subjects:

We introduce some generalized topological concepts to deal with union-closed families, and show that one can reduce the proof of Frankl's conjecture to some families of so-called supratopological spaces. We prove some results on the structure of normalized families, presenting a new way of reducing such a family to a smaller one using dual families. Applying our reduction method, we prove a refinement of a conjecture originally proposed by Poonen. Finally, we show that Frankl's Conjecture holds for the class of families obtained from successively applying the reduction process to a power set.

Optimal boundary regularity and Green function estimates for nonlocal equations in divergence form
Minhyun Kim, Marvin Weidner
Comments:
58 pages. To appear in J. Eur. Math. Soc
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
In this article we prove for the first time the $C^s$ boundary regularity for solutions to nonlocal elliptic equations with Hölder continuous coefficients in divergence form in $C^{1,\alpha}$ domains. So far, it was only known that solutions are Hölder continuous up to the boundary, and establishing their optimal regularity has remained an open problem in the field. Our proof is based on a delicate higher order Campanato-type iteration at the boundary, which we develop in the context of nonlocal equations and which is quite different from the local theory.
As an application of our results, we establish sharp two-sided Green function estimates in $C^{1,\alpha}$ domains for the same class of operators. Previously, this was only known under additional structural assumptions on the coefficients and in more regular domains.

We propose an effective algorithm that decides if a prime ideal in a polynomial ring over the complex numbers can be transformed into a toric ideal by a linear automorphism of the ambient space. If this is the case, the algorithm computes such a transformation explicitly. The algorithm can compute that all Gaussian graphical models on five vertices that are not initially toric cannot be made toric by any linear coordinate change. The same holds for all Gaussian conditional independence ideals of undirected graphs on six vertices.

Jammer Mitigation in Absorptive RIS-Assisted Uplink NOMA

Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT); Signal Processing (eess.SP)
Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is a promising technology for next-generation wireless communication systems due to its enhanced spectral efficiency. In this paper, we consider an uplink NOMA system operating together with a high-dimensional absorptive reconfigurable intelligent surface (A-RIS). We aim to minimize the total power transmitted by the users in order to meet signal-to-interference-plus-noise constraints at the base station in the presence of a jammer. We propose an iterative algorithm to solve the high-dimensional non-convex optimization problem using linear programming to find the transmit powers and a fractional programming algorithm based on the Dinkelbach algorithm with a sequential convex relaxation procedure to optimize the reflection coefficients. We show that our algorithm converges on large optimization problems, with a jammer comprising as many as $64$ antennas, and an A-RIS with $128$ elements. Our numerical results show that, compared with a standard RIS that reflects all impinging energy, the A-RIS can dramatically reduce the users' required transmit power and successfully mitigate interference from the jammer. The absorption capability of the A-RIS is in particular useful in cases when the number of jammer antennas is of the same order as the number of A-RIS elements.

Hölder curves with exotic tangent spaces
Eve Shaw, Vyron Vellis
Comments:
43 pages, 4 figures
Subjects:
Metric Geometry (math.MG); Dynamical Systems (math.DS)
An important implication of Rademacher's Differentiation Theorem is that every Lipschitz curve $\Gamma$ infinitesimally looks like a line at almost all of its points in the sense that at $\mathcal{H}^1$-almost every point of $\Gamma$, the only tangent to $\Gamma$ is a straight line through the origin. In this article, we show that, in contrast, the infinitesimal structure of Hölder curves can be much more extreme. First we show that for every $s>1$ there exists a $(1/s)$-Hölder curve $\Gamma_s$ in a Euclidean space with $\mathcal{H}^s(\Gamma_s)>0$ such that $\mathcal{H}^s$-almost every point of $\Gamma_s$ admits infinitely many topologically distinct tangents. Second, we study the tangents of self-similar connected sets (which are canonical examples of Hölder curves) and prove that the curves $\Gamma_s$ have the additional property that $\mathcal{H}^s$-almost every point of $\Gamma_s$ admits infinitely many homeomorphically distinct tangents to $\Gamma_s$ which are not admitted as (not even bi-Lipschitz to) tangents to any self-similar set at typical points.

Title:
Concave tents: a new tool for constructing concave reformulations of a large class of nonconvex optimization problems
Markus Gabl
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
Optimizing a nonlinear function over nonconvex sets is challenging since solving convex relaxations may lead to substantial relaxation gaps and infeasible solutions that must be "rounded" to feasible ones, often with uncontrollable losses in objective function performance. For this reason, these convex hulls are especially useful if the objective function is linear or even concave, since concave optimization is invariant to taking the convex hull of the feasible set. We propose the notion of concave tents, which are concave approximations of the original objective function that agree with this objective function on the feasible set, and allow for concave reformulations of the problem. Concave tents, therefore, are special cases of concave extensions. In this text, we derive such concave tents for a large class of objective functions as the optimal value functions of conic optimization problems. Hence, evaluating our concave tents requires solving a conic problem. We can find supergradients by solving the conic dual problem, so that differentiation is of the same complexity as evaluation. For feasible sets that are contained in the extreme points of their convex hull, we construct these concave tents in the original space of variables. For general feasible sets, we propose a double lifting strategy, where the original optimization problem is lifted into a higher-dimensional space in which the concave tent can be constructed easily. We investigate the relation of the so-constructed concave tents to concave envelopes and naive concave tents based on concave quadratic updates. Based on these ideas, we propose a primal heuristic for a class of robust discrete quadratic optimization problems that can be used instead of classical rounding techniques. Numerical experiments suggest that our techniques can be beneficial as an upper-bounding procedure in a branch-and-bound solution scheme.

We study the two-dimensional magnetic Laplacian when the magnetic field is allowed to be complex-valued. Under the assumption that the imaginary part of the magnetic potential is relatively form-bounded with respect to the real part of the magnetic Laplacian, we introduce the operator as an m-sectorial operator. In two dimensions, sufficient conditions are established to guarantee that the resolvent is compact. In the case of non-critical complex magnetic fields, a WKB approach is used to construct semiclassical pseudomodes, which do not exist when the magnetic field is real-valued.

We establish the Hölder continuity of bounded nonnegative weak solutions to \begin{align*} \big(\Phi^{-1}(w)\big)_t=\Delta w+\nabla\cdot\big(a(x,t)\Phi^{-1}(w)\big)+b\big(x,t,\Phi^{-1}(w)\big), \end{align*} with convex $\Phi\in C^0([0,\infty))\cap C^2((0,\infty))$ satisfying $\Phi(0)=0$, $\Phi'>0$ on $(0,\infty)$ and $$s\Phi''(s)\leq C\Phi'(s)\quad\text{for all }s\in[0,s_0]$$ for some $C>0$ and $s_0\in(0,1]$. The functions $a$ and $b$ are only assumed to satisfy integrability conditions of the form \begin{align*} a&\in L^{2q_1}\big((0,T);L^{2q_2}(\Omega;\mathbb{R}^N)\big),\\ b&\in M\big(\Omega_T\times\mathbb{R}\big)\ \text{such that }\big|b(x,t,\xi)\big|\leq \hat{b}(x,t)\ \text{a.e. for some }\hat{b}\in L^{q_1}\big((0,T);L^{q_2}(\Omega)\big) \end{align*} with $q_1,q_2>1$ such that $$\frac{2}{q_1}+\frac{N}{q_2}=2-N\kappa\quad\text{for some }\kappa\in(0,\tfrac{2}{N}).$$ Letting $w=\Phi(u)$ and assuming the inverse $\Phi^{-1}:[0,\infty)\to[0,\infty)$ to be locally Hölder continuous, this entails Hölder regularity for bounded weak solutions of $$u_t=\Delta\Phi(u)+\nabla\cdot\big(a(x,t)u\big)+b(x,t,u)$$ and, accordingly, covers a wide array of taxis type structures. In particular, many chemotaxis frameworks with nonlinear diffusion, which cannot be covered by the standard literature, fall into this category.
After rigorously treating local Hölder regularity, we also extend the regularity result to the associated initial-boundary value problem for boundary conditions of flux-type.

In this article, we compute the Gan-Gross-Prasad period integral of Klingen Eisenstein series over the unitary group $\mathrm{U}(m+1, n+1)$ with a cuspidal automorphic form over $\mathrm{U}(m+1, n)$, and show that it is related to certain special Rankin-Selberg $L$-values. We $p$-adically interpolate these Gan-Gross-Prasad period integrals as the Klingen Eisenstein series and the cuspidal automorphic form vary in Hida families. As a byproduct, we obtain a $p$-adic $L$-function of Rankin-Selberg type over $\mathrm{U}(m,n) \times \mathrm{U}(m+1, n)$. The ultimate motivation is to show the $p$-primitive property of Klingen Eisenstein series over unitary groups, by computing such Gan-Gross-Prasad period integrals, and this article is a starting point of this project. The $p$-primitivity of Eisenstein series is an essential property in the automorphic method in Iwasawa theory.

We consider a non-elementary group action $G \curvearrowright X$ of a locally compact second countable group $G$ on a possibly exotic non-discrete affine building $X$ of type $\tilde{A}_2$. We prove that if $\mu$ is an admissible symmetric probability measure on $G$, there is a unique $\mu$-stationary measure supported on the chambers of the spherical building at infinity. We use this result to study random walks induced by the $G$-action, and we prove that if $\mu$ has finite second moment, $(Z_n o)$ converges almost surely to a regular point of the boundary and the Lyapunov spectrum of the random walk is simple. Applied to Bruhat-Tits buildings, these results extend some classical theorems due to H.~Furstenberg.

We classify the possible types of minimal operations above an arbitrary permutation group. Above the trivial group, a theorem of Rosenberg yields that there are five types of minimal operations. We show that above any non-trivial permutation group there are at most four such types. Indeed, except above Boolean groups acting freely on a set, there are only three. In particular, this is the case for oligomorphic permutation groups, for which we improve a result of Bodirsky and Chen by showing one of the types in their classification does not exist. Building on these results, we answer three questions of Bodirsky that were previously open.

Quasi-Monte Carlo for partial differential equations with generalized Gaussian input uncertainty

Comments:

Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
There has been a surge of interest in uncertainty quantification for parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) with Gevrey regular inputs. The Gevrey class contains functions that are infinitely smooth with a growth condition on the higher-order partial derivatives, but which are nonetheless not analytic in general. Recent studies by Chernov and Le (Comput. Math. Appl., 2024, and SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 2024) as well as Harbrecht, Schmidlin, and Schwab (Math. Models Methods Appl. Sci., 2024) analyze the setting wherein the input random field is assumed to be uniformly bounded with respect to the uncertain parameters. In this paper, we relax this assumption and allow for parameter-dependent bounds. The parametric inputs are modeled as generalized Gaussian random variables, and we analyze the application of quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) integration to assess the PDE response statistics using randomly shifted rank-1 lattice rules. In addition to the QMC error analysis, we also consider the dimension truncation and finite element errors in this setting.

Tensor train solution to uncertain optimization problems with shared sparsity penalty
Harbir Antil, Sergey Dolgov, Akwum Onwunta
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC); Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
We develop both first and second order numerical optimization methods to solve non-smooth optimization problems featuring a shared sparsity penalty, constrained by differential equations with uncertainty. To alleviate the curse of dimensionality we use tensor product approximations. To handle the non-smoothness of the objective function we employ a smoothed version of the shared sparsity objective. We consider both a benchmark elliptic PDE constraint, and a more realistic topology optimization problem in engineering. We demonstrate that the error converges linearly in iterations and the smoothing parameter, and faster than algebraically in the number of degrees of freedom, consisting of the number of quadrature points in one variable and tensor ranks. Moreover, in the topology optimization problem, the smoothed shared sparsity penalty actually reduces the tensor ranks compared to the unpenalised solution. This enables us to find a sparse high-resolution design under a high-dimensional uncertainty.

Connections between conjugation quandles and their underlying groups via residual finiteness and the Hopf property

Comments:

Subjects:

We prove that if a conjugation quandle is Hopfian, then its underlying group is also Hopfian. We also show that the converse does not hold by providing an example. This highlights a distinction between conjugation quandles and their underlying groups. While a recent result shows that every hyperbolic group is Hopfian, conjugation quandles of hyperbolic groups can still be non-Hopfian. Furthermore, we examine conjugation quandles of Baumslag-Solitar groups. We show that these quandles are infinitely generated. Hence, to apply the result that every finitely generated residually finite quandle is Hopfian, it is necessary to work with finitely generated quandles. For this purpose, we employ Dehn quandles as subquandles, which allow us to fully characterize the residual finiteness of conjugation quandles of the Baumslag-Solitar groups.

Recently, Allen, Grove, Long, and Tu proposed an explicit Hypergeometric-Modularity method which gives a concrete link between certain hypergeometric objects and modular forms. The theory is exemplified by a collection of 199 weight 3 modular forms. Among other properties their process shows that the $L$-value of such a modular form at 1 is an explicit multiple of a ${}_3F_2(1)$ hypergeometric series. Using the framework of a finite Coxeter group governing the invariance group of normalized ${}_3F_2(1)$ series, this paper fully classifies and describes the possible Hecke eigenforms whose $L$-values that can be obtained using this method. In addition, we determine when these modular forms differ by twist of a finite-order character using the perspective of hypergeometric functions. As one application, we reinterpret a classical identity of hypergeometric series as a formula involving $L$-values of two Hecke eigenforms that differ by a twist.

The mantle has a trivial Tannakian radical, and we refer to braided fusion categories with this property as reductive. We investigate the properties and structure of reductive categories and prove several classification results.

Comments:

Subjects:
Symplectic Geometry (math.SG); Category Theory (math.CT)
This paper provides a blueprint for the construction of a symplectic $(A_\infty,2)$-category, $\mathsf{Symp}$. We develop two ways of encoding the information in $\mathsf{Symp}$ -- one topological, one algebraic. The topological encoding is as an $(A_\infty,2)$-flow category, which we define here. The algebraic encoding is as a linear $(A_\infty,2)$-category, which we extract from the topological encoding. In upcoming work, we plan to use the adiabatic Fredholm theory developed by us to construct $\mathsf{Symp}$ as an $(A_\infty,2)$-flow category, which thus induces a linear $(A_\infty,2)$-category.
The notion of a linear $(A_\infty,2)$-category develop here goes beyond the proposal of Bottman and Carmeli. The recursive structure of the 2-associahedra identifies faces with fiber products of 2-associahedra over associahedra, which led Bottman and Carmeli to associate operations to singular chains on 2-associahedra. The innovation in our new definition of linear $(A_\infty,2)$-category is to extend the family of 2-associahedra to include all fiber products of 2-associahedra over associahedra. This allows us to associate operations to cellular chains, which in particular enables us to produce a definition that involves only one operation in each arity, governed by a collection of $(A_\infty,2)$-equations.

This paper is devoted to the weighted estimates and the solvability of time-fractional parabolic equations. The leading coefficients \(a^{ij}(t,x)\) are assumed to have small mean oscillations in \((t,x)\) locally, in both non-divergence and divergence forms, in the whole space. By employing appropriate odd and even extensions along with suitable boundary value conditions, we derive the corresponding results for the half-space. The proofs rely on the application of the Fefferman-Stein theorem and the Hardy-Littlewood maximal function theorem in the context of weighted mixed spaces.

Subjects:

A celebrated result of Bousquet-Mélou and Jehanne states that the bivariate power series solutions of so-called combinatorial polynomial equations with one catalytic variable, also known as catalytic equations, are algebraic series. We give a purely combinatorial derivation of this result in the case of order one catalytic equations (those involving only one univariate unknown series). In particular our approach provides a tool to produce context-free specifications, or bijections with simple multi-type families of trees, for the derivation trees of combinatorial structures that are directly governed by an order one catalytic decomposition.
This provides a simple unified framework to deal with various combinatorial interpretation problems that were solved or raised over the last 50 years since the first such catalytic equation was written by W. T. Tutte in the late 60's to enumerate rooted planar maps.

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful framework for modeling complex interconnected systems, hence making them particularly well-suited to address the growing challenges of next-generation Internet of Things (NG-IoT) networks. Existing studies remain fragmented, and there is a lack of comprehensive guidance on how GNNs can be systematically applied to NG-IoT systems. As NG-IoT systems evolve toward 6G, they incorporate diverse technologies. These advances promise unprecedented connectivity, sensing, and automation but also introduce significant complexity, requiring new approaches for scalable learning, dynamic optimization, and secure, decentralized decision-making. This survey provides a comprehensive and forward-looking exploration of how GNNs can empower NG-IoT environments. We commence by exploring the fundamental paradigms of GNNs and articulating the motivation for their use in NG-IoT networks. Besides, we intrinsically connect GNNs with the family of low-density parity-check codes, modeling the NG-IoT as dynamic constrained graphs. We highlight the distinct roles of node-, edge-, and graph-level tasks in tackling key challenges and demonstrate the GNNs' ability to overcome the limitations of traditional optimization. We examine the application of GNNs across core NG-enabling technologies and their integration with distributed frameworks to support privacy-preservation and distributed intelligence. We then delve into the challenges posed by adversarial attacks, offering insights into defense mechanisms. Lastly, we examine how GNNs can be integrated with emerging technologies. Our findings highlight the transformative potential of GNNs in improving efficiency, scalability, and security. Finally, we summarize the key lessons learned and outline promising future research directions, along with a set of design guidelines tailored for NG-IoT applications.

A series of robust and optimal mixed methods based on two mixed formulations of the fourth-order elliptic singular perturbation problem are developed in this paper. First, a mixed method based on a second-order system is proposed without relying on Nitsche's technique or interpolations. Robust and optimal error estimates are derived using an $L^2$-bounded interpolation operator for tensors. Then, its connections to other discrete methods, including weak Galerkin methods and a mixed finite element method based on a first-order system, are established. Finally, numerical experiments are provided to validate the theoretical results.

Title:
Maximum Likelihood Estimation of the Parameters of Matrix Variate Symmetric Laplace Distribution
Pooja Yadav, Tanuja Srivastava
Subjects:
Statistics Theory (math.ST)
This paper considers an extension of the multivariate symmetric Laplace distribution to matrix variate case. The symmetric Laplace distribution is a scale mixture of normal distribution. The maximum likelihood estimators (MLE) of the parameters of multivariate and matrix variate symmetric Laplace distribution are proposed, which are not explicitly obtainable, as the density function involves the modified Bessel function of the third kind. Thus, the EM algorithm is applied to find the maximum likelihood estimators. The parameters and their maximum likelihood estimators of matrix variate symmetric Laplace distribution are defined up to a positive multiplicative constant with their Kronecker product uniquely defined. The condition for the existence of the MLE is given, and the stability of the estimators is discussed. The empirical bias and the dispersion of the Kronecker product of the estimators for different sample sizes are discussed using simulated data.

Sharp energy decay rates for the damped wave equation on the torus via non-polynomial derivative bound conditions

Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Spectral Theory (math.SP)
For the damped wave equation on the torus, when some geodesics never meet the positive set of the damping, energy decay rates are known to depend on derivative bounds and growth properties of the damping near the boundary of its support, as well as the geometry of the support of the damping. In this paper we obtain, sometimes sharp, energy decay rates for damping which satisfy more general non-polynomial derivative bounds and growth properties. We also show how these rates can depend on the geometry of the support of the damping. We prove general results and apply them to examples of damping growing exponentially slowly, polynomial-logarithmically, or logarithmically. The decay rates found for these examples interpolate between known sharp rates for purely polynomial damping. The proof relies on estimating the solution at very fine, non-poynomial, semiclassical scales to obtain resolvent estimates, which are then converted to energy decay rates via semigroup theory.

A Variational Principle for Extended Irreversible Thermodynamics: Heat Conducting Viscous Fluids
François Gay-Balmaz
Journal-ref:
Journal of Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics, 2025
Subjects:
Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Classical Physics (physics.class-ph)
Extended irreversible thermodynamics is a theory that expands the classical framework of nonequilibrium thermodynamics by going beyond the local-equilibrium assumption. A notable example of this is the Maxwell-Cattaneo heat flux model, which introduces a time lag in the heat flux response to temperature gradients. In this paper, we develop a variational formulation of the equations of extended irreversible thermodynamics by introducing an action principle for a nonequilibrium Lagrangian that treats thermodynamic fluxes as independent variables. A key feature of this approach is that it naturally extends both Hamilton's principle of reversible continuum mechanics and the earlier variational formulation of classical irreversible thermodynamics. The variational principle is initially formulated in the material (Lagrangian) description, from which the Eulerian form is derived using material covariance (or relabeling symmetries). The tensorial structure of the thermodynamic fluxes dictates the choice of objective rate in the Eulerian description, and plays a central role in the emergence of nonequilibrium stresses - arising from both viscous and thermal effects - that are essential to ensure thermodynamic consistency. This framework naturally results in the Cattaneo-Christov model for heat flux. We also investigate the extension of the approach to accommodate higher-order fluxes and the general form of entropy fluxes. The variational framework presented in this paper has promising applications in the development of structure-preserving and thermodynamically consistent numerical methods. It is particularly relevant for modeling systems where entropy production is a delicate issue that requires careful treatment to ensure consistency with the laws of thermodynamics.

Ground States for the Defocusing Nonlinear Schrödinger Equation on Non-Compact Metric Graphs
Élio Durand-Simonnet, Boris Shakarov
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
We investigate the existence and stability of ground states for the defocusing nonlinear Schrödinger equation on non-compact metric graphs. We establish a sharp criterion for the existence of action ground states in terms of the spectral properties of the underlying Hamiltonian: ground states exist if and only if the bottom of the spectrum is negative and the frequency lies within a suitable range. We further explore the relation between action and energy ground states, showing that while every action minimizer yields an energy minimizer, the converse fails in general. In particular, we prove that energy ground states may not exist for arbitrary masses. This discrepancy is illustrated through explicit examples on star graphs with $\delta$ and $\delta'$-type vertex conditions: in the mass-subcritical case, we exhibit a large interval of masses for which no energy minimizer exists, whereas in the supercritical regime, energy ground states exist for all masses.

A notion of fractality for a class of states and noncommutative relative distance zeta functional
Yat Tin Chow
Subjects:

In this work, we first recall the definition of the relative distance zeta function in [42, 43, 44, 46, 47] and slightly generalize this notion from sets to probability measures, and then move on to propose a novel definition a relative distance (and tube) zeta functional for a class of states over a C* algebra. With such an extension, we look into the chance to define relative Minkowski dimensions in this context, and explore the notion of fractality for this class of states. Relative complex dimensions as poles of this newly proposed relative distance zeta functional, as well as its geometric and transformation properties, decomposition rules and properties that respects tensor products are discussed. We then explore some examples that possess fractal properties with this new zeta functional and propose functional equations similar to [11].

The Small-Gain Condition for Infinite Networks Modeled on $\ell^{\infty}$-Spaces
Christoph Kawan
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC); Dynamical Systems (math.DS)
In recent years, attempts have been made to extend nonlinear small-gain theorems for input-to-state stability (ISS) from finite networks to countably infinite networks with finite indegrees. Under specific assumptions about the interconnection gains and the ISS formulation, corresponding infinite-dimensional small-gain results have been proven. However, concerning these assumptions, the results are still too narrow to be considered a full extension of the state-of-the-art for finite networks. We take a step to closing this gap by developing a general technical framework within which the small-gain condition for both finite and infinite networks can be analyzed. This includes a thorough investigation of various monotone operators associated with a network and a specific ISS formulation. Our results extend and generalize the existing theory for finite networks, yield complete characterizations of the small-gain condition for specific ISS formulations, and show which obstacles still have to be overcome to obtain a complete theory for the most general infinite case.

Isometric Representation of Lipschitz-Free Spaces over Connected Orientable Riemannian Manifolds

We show that the Lipschitz-Free Space over a connected orientable $n$-di\-men\-sio\-nal Riemannian manifold $M$ is isometrically isomorphic to a quotient of $L^1(M,TM)$, the integrable sections of the tangent bundle $TM$, if $M$ is either complete or lies isometrically inside a complete manifold $N$. Two functions are deemed equivalent in this quotient space if their difference has distributional divergence zero.
This quotient is the pre-annihilator of the exact essentially bounded currents, and if $M$ is simply connected, one may replace ``exact'' with ``closed'' currents.

Data-Driven Distributed Optimization via Aggregative Tracking and Deep-Learning
Riccardo Brumali, Guido Carnevale, Giuseppe Notarstefano
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC); Systems and Control (eess.SY)
In this paper, we propose a novel distributed data-driven optimization scheme. In detail, we focus on the so-called aggregative framework, a scenario in which a set of agents aim to cooperatively minimize the sum of local costs, each depending on both local decision variables and an aggregation of all of them. We consider a data-driven setup where each objective function is unknown and can be sampled at a single point per iteration (thanks to, e.g., feedback from users or sensors). We address this scenario through a distributed algorithm combining three components: (i) a learning part leveraging neural networks to learn the local costs descent direction, (ii) an optimization routine steering the estimates according to the learned direction to minimize the global cost, and (iii) a tracking mechanism locally reconstructing the unavailable global quantities. Using tools from system theory, i.e., timescale separation and averaging theory, we formally prove that in strongly convex setups, the distributed scheme linearly converges to a neighborhood of the optimum, whose radius depends on the accuracy of the neural networks. Finally, numerical simulations validate the theoretical results.

We consider the system of elastic waves with critical space dependent damping $V(x)$. We study the Cauchy problem for this model in the $2$-dimensional Euclidean space ${\bf R}^{2}$, and we obtain faster decay rates of the total energy as time goes to infinity. In the $2$-D case we do not have any suitable Hardy type inequality, so generally one has no idea to establish optimal energy decay. We develope a special type of multiplier method combined with some estimates brought by the $2$-D Newton potential belonging to the usual Laplacian $-\Delta$, not the operator $-a^2\Delta - (b^{2}-a^{2})\nabla {\rm div}$ itself. The property of finite speed propagation is important to get results for this system.

The closed-form expressions of electric potentials and field lines for a uniformly-charged tube and cylinder are presented using elliptic integrals and Appell's hypergeometric functions, where field lines are depicted by introducing the concept of the field line potential in axisymmetric systems, whose contour lines represent electric field lines outside the charged region, thought of as an analog of the conjugate harmonic function in the presence of non-uniform metric. The field line potential for the tube shows a multi-valued behavior and enables us to define a topological charge. The integral of $Z(u|m)\operatorname{sc}(u|m)$, where $ Z $ and $ \operatorname{sc} $ are the Jacobi zeta and elliptic functions, is also expressed by Appell's hypergeometric function as a by-product, which was missing in classical tables of formulas. In the Addendum appended after the main article, several relevant references are provided and the decomposition of the solution by ``degrees of transcendence'' is proposed.

Optimal Data Splitting for Holdout Cross-Validation in Large Covariance Matrix Estimation

Subjects:

Cross-validation is a statistical tool that can be used to improve large covariance matrix estimation. Although its efficiency is observed in practical applications and a convergence result towards the error of the non linear shrinkage is available in the high-dimensional regime, formal proofs that take into account the finite sample size effects are currently lacking. To carry on analytical analysis, we focus on the holdout method, a single iteration of cross-validation, rather than the traditional $k$-fold approach. We derive a closed-form expression for the expected estimation error when the population matrix follows a white inverse Wishart distribution, and we observe the optimal train-test split scales as the square root of the matrix dimension. For general population matrices, we connected the error to the variance of eigenvalues distribution, but approximations are necessary. In this framework and in the high-dimensional asymptotic regime, both the holdout and $k$-fold cross-validation methods converge to the optimal estimator when the train-test ratio scales with the square root of the matrix dimension which is coherent with the existing theory.

We study the solution theory of the whole-space static (elliptic) Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation in spectral Barron spaces. We prove that under the assumption that the coefficients involved are spectral Barron functions and the discount factor is sufficiently large, there exists a sequence of uniformly bounded spectral Barron functions that converges locally uniformly to the solution. As a consequence, the solution of the HJB equation can be approximated by two-layer neural networks without curse of dimensionality.

Welfare and Cost Aggregation for Multi-Agent Control: When to Choose Which Social Cost Function, and Why?

Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC); Multiagent Systems (cs.MA); Systems and Control (eess.SY)
Many multi-agent socio-technical systems rely on aggregating heterogeneous agents' costs into a social cost function (SCF) to coordinate resource allocation in domains like energy grids, water allocation, or traffic management. The choice of SCF often entails implicit assumptions and may lead to undesirable outcomes if not rigorously justified. In this paper, we demonstrate that what determines which SCF ought to be used is the degree to which individual costs can be compared across agents and which axioms the aggregation shall fulfill. Drawing on the results from social choice theory, we provide guidance on how this process can be used in control applications. We demonstrate which assumptions about interpersonal utility comparability - ranging from ordinal level comparability to full cardinal comparability - together with a choice of desirable axioms, inform the selection of a correct SCF, be it the classical utilitarian sum, the Nash SCF, or maximin. We then demonstrate how the proposed framework can be applied for principled allocations of water and transportation resources.

This paper establishes a precise correspondence between semi-orthogonal decompositions (SOD) and finite t-stabilities on a triangulated category $\mathcal{D}$. By means of a reduction technique to certain quotient categories, we characterize the connectedness of the mutation graph of the finest $\infty$-admissible SODs of $\mathcal{D}$. Moreover, when $\mathcal{D}$ admits a Serre functor and satisfies a mild condition, we establish one-to-one correspondences among (1) finest SODs, (2) finite finest t-stabilities, (3) finite finest admissible filtrations, and (4) full exceptional sequences. These correspondences are proved to be compatible with mutations. As a by-product, classifications of SODs for the projective plane, weighted projective lines, and finite acyclic quivers are obtained.

Extremal monomial property of q-characters and polynomiality of the X-series

The character of every irreducible finite-dimensional representation of a simple Lie algebra has the highest weight property. The invariance of the character under the action of the Weyl group W implies that there is a similar "extremal weight property" for every weight obtained by applying an element of W to the highest weight. In this paper we conjecture an analogous "extremal monomial property" of the q-characters of simple finite-dimensional modules over the quantum affine algebras, using the braid group action on q-characters defined by Chari. In the case of the identity element of W, this is the highest monomial property of q-characters proved in arXiv:math/9911112. Here we prove it for simple reflections. Somewhat surprisingly, the extremal monomial property for each w in W turns out to be equivalent to polynomiality of the "X-series" corresponding to w, which we introduce in this paper. We show that these X-series are equal to certain limits of the generalized Baxter operators for all w in W. Thus, we find a new bridge between q-characters and the spectra of XXZ-type quantum integrable models associated to quantum affine algebras. This leads us to conjecture polynomiality of all generalized Baxter operators, extending the results of arXiv:1308.3444.

Optimality of Gradient-MUSIC for spectral estimation
Albert Fannjiang, Weilin Li, Wenjing Liao
Comments:
60 pages, 4 figures; revised introduction
Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT)
We introduce the Gradient-MUSIC algorithm for estimating the unknown frequencies and amplitudes of a nonharmonic signal from noisy time samples. While the classical MUSIC algorithm performs a computationally expensive search over a fine grid, Gradient-MUSIC is significantly more efficient and eliminates the need for discretization over a fine grid by using optimization techniques. It coarsely scans the 1D landscape to find initialization simultaneously for all frequencies followed by parallelizable local refinement via gradient descent. We also analyze its performance when the noise level is sufficiently small and the signal frequencies are separated by at least $8\pi/m$, where $\pi/m$ is the standard resolution of this problem. Even though the 1D landscape is nonconvex, we prove a global convergence result for Gradient-MUSIC: coarse scanning provably finds suitable initialization and gradient descent converges at a linear rate. In addition to convergence results, we also upper bound the error between the true signal frequencies and amplitudes with those found by Gradient-MUSIC. For example, if the noise has $\ell^\infty$ norm at most $\epsilon$, then the frequencies and amplitudes are recovered up to error at most $C\varepsilon/m$ and $C\varepsilon$ respectively, which are minimax optimal in $m$ and $\varepsilon$. Our theory can also handle stochastic noise with performance guarantees under nonstationary independent Gaussian noise. Our main approach is a comprehensive geometric analysis of the landscape, a perspective that has not been explored before.

In this work, we study the non-local analogue of Brezis-Nirenberg and logistic type elliptic equations involving the logarithmic Laplacian and critical logarithmic non-linearity with superlinear-subcritical perturbation.
In the first part of this work, we derive new sharp, continuous and compact embeddings of nonlocal Sobolev spaces (of order zero) into Orlicz type spaces. As an application of these embeddings and variational analysis as carried out in \cite{Angeles-Saldana-2023, Santamaria-Saldana-2022}, we prove the existence of a least energy weak solution of the Brezis-Nirenberg and logistic type problem involving the logarithmic Laplacian. For the uniqueness of solution, we prove a new Díaz-Saa type inequality, which is of independent interest and can be applied to a larger class of problems.
In the second part of the work, depending upon the growth of non-linearity and regularity of the weight function, we study the small-order asymptotic of non-local weighted elliptic equations involving the fractional Laplacian of order $2s.$ We show that least energy solutions of a weighted non-local fractional problem with superlinear or sublinear type non-linearity converge to a non-trivial, non-negative least energy solution of a Brezis-Nirenberg type or logistic-type problem, respectively, involving the logarithmic Laplacian.

As observed by Joyal, the cohomology groups of the partition posets are naturally identified with the components of the operad encoding Lie algebras. This connection was explained in terms of operadic Koszul duality by Fresse, and later generalized by Vallette to the setting of decorated partitions. In this article, we set up and study a general formalism which produces a priori operadic structures (operads and operadic modules) on the cohomology of families of posets equipped with some natural recursive structure, that we call "operadic poset species". This framework goes beyond decorated partitions and operadic Koszul duality, and contains the metabelian Lie operad and Kontsevich's operad of trees as two simple instances. In forthcoming work, we will apply our results to the hypertree posets and their connections to post-Lie and pre-Lie algebras.

Stage-Parallel Implicit Runge--Kutta methods via low-rank matrix equation corrections

Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
Implicit Runge--Kutta (IRK) methods are highly effective for solving stiff ordinary differential equations (ODEs) but can be computationally expensive for large-scale problems due to the need of solving coupled algebraic equations at each step. This study improves IRK efficiency by leveraging parallelism to decouple stage computations and reduce communication overhead, specifically we stably decouple a perturbed version of the stage system of equations and recover the exact solution by solving a Sylvester matrix equation with an explicitly known low-rank right-hand side. Two IRK families -- symmetric methods and collocation methods -- are analyzed, with extensions to nonlinear problems using a simplified Newton method. Implementation details, shared memory parallel code, and numerical examples, particularly for ODEs from spatially discretized PDEs, demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed IRK technique.

We propose an approach to Carrollian geometry using principal $\mathbb{R}^\times$-bundles ($\mathbb{R}^\times := \matthbb{R} \setminus \{0\}$) equipped with a degenerate metric whose kernel is the module of vertical vector fields. The constructions allow for non-trivial bundles, and a large class of Carrollian manifolds can be analysed in this formalism. A key result in this is that once a principal connection has been selected, there is a canonical non-degenerate metric that can be leveraged to circumvent the difficulties associated with a degenerate metric. Within this framework, we examine the Levi-Civita connection and null geodesics.

We develop a simple yet efficient Lagrangian method for computing equilibrium prices in a mean-field game price-formation model. We prove that equilibrium prices are optimal in terms of a suitable criterion and derive a primal-dual gradient-based algorithm for computing them. One of the highlights of our computational framework is the efficient, simple, and flexible implementation of the algorithm using modern automatic differentiation techniques. Our implementation is modular and admits a seamless extension to high-dimensional settings with more complex dynamics, costs, and equilibrium conditions. Additionally, automatic differentiation enables a versatile algorithm that requires only coding the cost functions of agents. It automatically handles the gradients of the costs, thereby eliminating the need to manually form the adjoint equations.

Ramsey goodness of stars and fans for the Hajós graph

Subjects:

Given two graphs $G_1$ and $G_2$, the Ramsey number $R(G_1,G_2)$ denotes the smallest integer $N$ such that any red-blue coloring of the edges of $K_N$ contains either a red $G_1$ or a blue $G_2$. Let $G_1$ be a graph with chromatic number $\chi$ and chromatic surplus $s$, and let $G_2$ be a connected graph with $n$ vertices. The graph $G_2$ is said to be Ramsey-good for the graph $G_1$ (or simply $G_1$-good) if, for $n \ge s$, \[R(G_1,G_2)=(\chi-1)(n-1)+s.\]
The $G_1$-good property has been extensively studied for star-like graphs when $G_1$ is a graph with $\chi(G_1)\ge 3$, as seen in works by Burr-Faudree-Rousseau-Schelp (J. Graph Theory, 1983), Li-Rousseau (J. Graph Theory, 1996), Lin-Li-Dong (European J. Combin., 2010), Fox-He-Wigderson (Adv. Combin., 2023), and Liu-Li (J. Graph Theory, 2025), among others. However, all prior results require $G_1$ to have chromatic surplus $1$. In this paper, we extend this investigation to graphs with chromatic surplus 2 by considering the Hajós graph $H_a$. For a star $K_{1,n}$, we prove that $K_{1,n}$ is $H_a$-good if and only if $n$ is even. For a fan $F_n$ with $n\ge 111$, we prove that $F_n$ is $H_a$-good.

Let $\mathfrak{S}(\underline{s},w)$ be the graph whose vertices are all subexpressions with target $w$ of a fixed expression $\underline{s}$ in generators of a Coxeter group and edges are the pairs of subexpressions with Hamming distance 2. We prove that $\mathfrak{S}(\underline{s},w)$ is connected and its cycle space is spanned by cycles of lengths $d+2$, where $d$ ranges over all positive divisors of all finite orders of products of at most two entries of $\underline{s}$.

Classically psh and pluriharmonic functions on Berkovich spaces

Comments:
40 pages. Theorem 6.5 is new. Explained the relationship to the psh functions in the new version of [CLD]
Subjects:
Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Complex Variables (math.CV)
First we extend the theory of subharmonic functions on smooth strictly $k$-analytic curves from Thuillier's thesis to the case of possibly singular analytic curves over a non-archimedean field. Classically psh functions are then defined as in complex geometry by using pullbacks to analytic curves (and requiring compatibility with base change). We give various properties of classically psh functions including a local and a global maximum principle. As a consequence, we show that the space of pluriharmonic functions on a quasi-compact Berkovich space is finite dimensional. As a technical tool, we use that a connected Berkovich space is connected by analytic curves.

Subjects:

We use reverse mathematics to analyze "iterated jump" versions of the following four principles: the atomic model theorem with subenumerable types (AST), the diagonally noncomputable principle (DNR), weak weak Kőnig's lemma (WWKL), and weak Kőnig's lemma (WKL). The logical relationships between these principles are summarized in Figure 1 and include, among other things, an infinite chain and an infinite antichain, the latter of which represents a strong form of non-linearity in terms of provability strength among "natural" combinatorial principles.

A Fermat spiral is a set of points of the form $\sqrt{n}e^{2\pi i\alpha n}$ for $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$.

Furthermore, we show that if $\alpha$ is badly approximable the Chabauty limits are always lattices, for which we give a characterisation.

We introduce a notion of quasi-triangular anti-dendriform bialgebras, which can be induced by the solutions of the AD-YBE whose symmetric parts are invariant. A factorizable anti-dendriform bialgebra leads to a factorization of the underlying anti-dendriform algebra. Moreover, relative Rota-Baxter operators with weights are introduced to characterize the solutions of the AD-YBE whose symmetric parts are invariant. Finally, we interpret factorizable anti-dendriform bialgebras in terms of quadratic Rota-Baxter anti-dendriform algebras.

$k$-Quasi $n$-Power Posinormal Operators: Theory and Weighted Conditional Type Applications

Comments:
Revised Version, 13 pages
Subjects:
Functional Analysis (math.FA)
This paper introduces and investigates the class of \textit{$k$-quasi $n$-power posinormal operators} in Hilbert spaces, generalizing both posinormal and $n$-power posinormal operators. We establish fundamental properties including matrix representations in $2 \times 2$ block form, tensor product preservation ($T\otimes S$ remains in the class when $T,S$ are), and complete characterizations for weighted conditional type operators $\tTwu := wE(uf)$ on $L^2(\Sigma)$. Key theoretical contributions include a structural decomposition theorem for operators with non-dense range, spectral properties, invariant subspace behavior, and interactions with isometric operators. For weighted operators, we derive explicit conditions for $k$-quasi $n$-power posinormality in terms of weight functions $w,u$ and their conditional expectations. The work bridges abstract operator theory with concrete applications, particularly in conditional expectation analysis, while significantly extending posinormal operator theory. The results provide new tools for operator analysis with potential applications in spectral theory, functional calculus, and mathematical physics. Concrete examples throughout the paper illustrate the theory, and the framework opens new research directions in operator theory and its applications, offering both theoretical insights and practical computational tools for analyzing this important class of operators in Hilbert spaces.

Algebraic and Graphical Analysis of H-Toeplitz operators on Fock space

Subjects:
Functional Analysis (math.FA); Operator Algebras (math.OA)
This paper presents a comprehensive study of H-Toeplitz operators on the Fock space, a class of operators that synthesizes structural elements of both Toeplitz and Hankel operators. We derive explicit matrix representations for these operators with respect to the standard orthonormal basis of monomials, providing a foundational tool for their analysis. Central to our investigation are the algebraic and spectral properties of these operators. We establish precise conditions for commutativity, particularly for operators with harmonic symbols, and prove that non-zero H-Toeplitz operators cannot be Hilbert-Schmidt. Furthermore, we develop a Mellin transform-based framework to characterize the hyponormality and normality of operators with quasi-homogeneous symbols, deriving verifiable analytical criteria. Finally, we introduce the novel concept of directed H-Toeplitz graphs to visualize the adjacency relations encoded by the matrix structure of these operators. This graphical representation reveals distinct and interpretable patterns in indegree and outdegree sequences, offering a new combinatorial lens through which to understand their structure. Our results forge a significant connection between the analytic theory of operators on function spaces and the discrete structures of graph theory, enriching both fields.

Classifying integral Grothendieck rings up to rank 5 and beyond

Comments:

In this paper, we define a Grothendieck ring as a fusion ring categorifiable into a fusion category over the complex field. An integral fusion ring is called Drinfeld if all its formal codegrees are integers dividing the global Frobenius--Perron dimension. Every integral Grothendieck ring is necessarily Drinfeld.
Using the fact that the formal codegrees of integral Drinfeld rings form an Egyptian fraction summing to 1, we derive a finite list of possible global FPdims for small ranks. Applying Normaliz, we classify all fusion rings with these candidate FPdims, retaining only those admitting a Drinfeld structure. To exclude Drinfeld rings that are not Grothendieck rings, we analyze induction matrices to the Drinfeld center, classified via our new Normaliz feature. Further exclusions and constructions involve group-theoretical fusion categories and Schur multipliers.
Our main result is a complete classification of integral Grothendieck rings up to rank 5, extended to rank 7 in odd-dimensional and noncommutative cases using Frobenius--Schur indicators and Galois theory. Moreover, we show that any noncommutative, odd-dimensional, integral Grothendieck ring of rank at most 22 is pointed of rank 21.
We also classify all integral 1-Frobenius Drinfeld rings of rank 6, identify the first known non-Isaacs integral fusion category (which turns out to be group-theoretical), classify integral noncommutative Drinfeld rings of rank 8, and integral 1-Frobenius MNSD Drinfeld rings of rank 9. Finally, we determine the smallest-rank exotic simple integral fusion rings: rank 4 in general, rank 6 in the Drinfeld case, and rank 7 in the 1-Frobenius Drinfeld case.

Weak-strong uniqueness of the full coupled Navier-Stokes and Q-tensor system in dimension three

In this paper, we study the weak-strong uniqueness for the Leray-Hopf type weak solutions to the Beris-Edwards model of nematic liquid crystals in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with an arbitrary parameter $\xi\in\mathbb{R}$, which measures the ratio of tumbling and alignment effects caused by the flow. This result is obtained by proposing a new uniqueness criterion in terms of $(\Delta Q,\nabla u)$ with regularity $L_t^qL_x^p$ for $\frac{2}{q}+\frac{3}{p}=\frac{3}{2}$ and $2\leq p\leq 6$, which enable us to deal with the additional nonlinear difficulties arising from the parameter $\xi$. Comparing with the results of related literature, our finding also reveals a new regime of weak-strong uniqueness for the simplified case of $\xi=0$. Moreover, we establish the global well-posedness of this model for small initial data in $H^s$-framework.

Koutschan, Krattenthaler and Schlosser recently considered a family of binomial determinants. In this work, we give combinatorial interpretations of two subclasses of these determinants in terms of domino tilings and nonintersecting lattice paths, thereby partially answering a question of theirs. Furthermore, the determinant evaluations established by Koutschan, Krattenthaler and Schlosser produce many product formulas for our weighted enumerations of domino tilings and nonintersecting lattice paths. However, there are still two enumerations left corresponding to conjectural formulas made by the three. We hereby prove the two conjectures using the principle of holonomic Ansatz plus the approach of modular reduction for creative telescoping, and hence fill the gap.

Feedback Optimization of Dynamical Systems in Time-Varying Environments: An Internal Model Principle Approach
Gianluca Bianchin, Bryan Van Scoy
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
Feedback optimization has emerged as a promising approach for regulating dynamical systems to optimal steady states that are implicitly defined by underlying optimization problems. Despite their effectiveness, existing methods face two key limitations: (i) reliable performance is restricted to time-invariant or slowly varying settings, and (ii) convergence rates are limited by the need for the controller to operate orders of magnitude slower than the plant. These limitations can be traced back to the reliance of existing techniques on numerical optimization algorithms. In this paper, we propose a novel perspective on the design of feedback optimization algorithms, by framing these objectives as an output regulation problem. We place particular emphasis on time-varying optimization problems, and show that an algorithm can track time-varying optimizers if and only if it incorporates a model of the temporal variability inherent to the optimization - a requirement that we term the internal model principle of feedback optimization. Building on this insight, we introduce a new design methodology that couples output-feedback stabilization with a control component that drives the system toward the critical points of the optimization problem. This framework enables feedback optimization algorithms to overcome the classical limitations of slow tracking and poor adaptability to time variations.

Estimates for pseudo-differential operators on the torus revisited. III

Comments:
19 pages
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
This paper finishes the goal of the authors started in two previous manuscripts dedicated to revisiting the continuity properties of toroidal pseudo-differential operators with symbols in the Hörmander classes. Here we prove pointwise estimates in terms of the Fefferman-Stein sharp maximal function and of the Hardy-Littlewood maximal function. Combining these estimates with the properties of Muckenhoupt's weight class $A_p$ we obtain boundedness theorems for pseudo-differential operators between weighted Lebesgue spaces on the torus $L^p(w)$. These results are given in the context of the global symbolic analysis defined on $\mathbb{T}^n\times \mathbb{Z}^n$ as developed by Ruzhansky and Turunen by using discrete Fourier analysis, and extend those of Park and Tomita available in the Euclidean case. Moreover, we include continuity results on Sobolev spaces $W^s_p$ and on Besov spaces $B^s_{p,q}$ on the torus. Our techniques are taken from Park and Tomita \cite{park-tomita} and we consider its toroidal extension here for the completeness of the boundedness of toroidal pseudo-differential operators with respect to the current literature.

Limiting behavior of principal eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for a class of elliptic operators with degenerate large advection

Subjects:

In this paper we study, both numerically and analytically, the asymptotic behavior of the principal eigenfunction of \eqref{1.1}, normalized by \eqref{1.2}, as $s\uparrow +\infty$. Based on the numerical computations of this paper, we can prove that, under condition (Hm) bellow, $\varphi_s$ approximates $1$ and $\varphi_s'$ approximates $0$, uniformly in $[-1,1]$, as $s\uparrow +\infty$. As a byproduct of this result, we can derive the asymptotic behavior of the principal eigenvalue in a one-dimensional situation not previously covered by \cite{ChLo} and \cite{PeZh}, as we are working under minimal regularity assumptions on $m(x)$. A recent result of \cite{BWZ} shows that the principal eigenvalue might oscillate as $s\uparrow +\infty$ if $m(x)$ is highly oscillatory. Thus, the oscillatory and regularity properties of $m(x)$ might severely affect the asymptotic behavior of $(\lambda_s,\varphi_s)$ as $s\uparrow +\infty$.

Group-averaged Markov chains: mixing improvement

Comments:
68 pages
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR); Information Theory (cs.IT); Group Theory (math.GR); Computation (stat.CO)
For Markov kernels $P$ on a general state space $\mathcal{X}$, we introduce a new class of averaged Markov kernels $P_{da}(G,\nu)$ of $P$ induced by a group $G$ that acts on $\mathcal{X}$ and a probability measure $\nu$ on $G \times G$. Notable special cases are the group-orbit average $\overline{P}$, left-average $P_{la}$, right-average $P_{ra}$ and the independent-double-average $(P_{la})_{ra}$. For $\pi$-stationary $P$ in which $\pi$ is invariant with respect to $G$, we show that in general $P_{da}$ enjoys favorable convergence properties than $P$ based on metrics such as spectral gap or asymptotic variance, and within the family of $P_{da}$ the most preferable kernel is in general $(P_{la})_{ra}$. We demonstrate that $P_{la}, P_{ra}, (P_{la})_{ra}$ are comparable in terms of mixing times, which supports the use of $P_{la}, P_{ra}$ in practice as computationally cheaper alternatives over $(P_{la})_{ra}$. These averaged kernels also admit natural geometric interpretations: they emerge as unique projections of $P$ onto specific $G$-invariant structures under the Kullback-Leibler divergence or the Hilbert-Schmidt norm and satisfy Pythagorean identities. On the other hand, in the general case if $\pi$ is not invariant with respect to $G$, we propose and study a technique that we call state-dependent averaging of Markov kernels which generalizes the earlier results to this setting. As examples and applications, this averaging perspective not only allows us to recast state-of-the-art Markov chain samplers such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo or piecewise-deterministic Markov processes as specific cases of $P_{da}$, but also enables improvements to existing samplers such as Metropolis-Hastings, achieving rapid mixing in some toy models or when $\pi$ is the discrete uniform distribution.

Homotopy equivalence of digital pictures in $\mathbb{Z}^2$

Subjects:
Algebraic Topology (math.AT); Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM)
We investigate the properties of digital homotopy in the context of digital pictures $(X,\kappa,\bar \kappa)$, where $X\subsetneq \Z^n$ is a finite set, $\kappa$ is an adjacency relation on $X$, and $\bar \kappa$ is an adjacency relation on the complement of $X$. In particular we focus on homotopy equivalence between digital pictures in $\Z^2$. We define a numerical homotopy-type invariant for digital pictures in $\Z^2$ called the outer perimeter, which is a basic tool for distinguishing homotopy types of digital pictures. When a digital picture has no holes, we show that it is homotopy equivalent to its rc-convex hull, obtained by ``filling in the gaps'' of any row or column. We show that a digital picture $(X,c_i,c_j)$ is homotopy equivalent to only finitely many other digital pictures $(Y,c_i,c_j)$. At the end of the paper, we raise a conjecture on the largest digital picture of the same homotopy-type of a given digital picture.

We compute the first $\ell^2$-Betti number of the automorphism and outer automorphism groups of arbitrary right-angled Artin groups (RAAGs), providing a complete characterization of when it is non-zero. In addition, we determine all $\ell^2$-Betti numbers of the outer automorphism group in the case where the defining graph is disconnected and the associated RAAG is not isomorphic to a free group. We also analyse the algebraic fibring of the pure symmetric automorphism groups $\mathrm{PSA}(A_\Gamma)$ and $\mathrm{PSO}(A_\Gamma)$ and the virtual algebraic fibring of $\mathrm{Out}(A_\Gamma)$ in the case when $A_\Gamma$ admits no non-inner partial conjugation. In the transvection-free case, we show that $\beta_1^{(2)}(\mathrm{Out}(A_\Gamma)) = 0$ if and only if $\mathrm{Out}(A_\Gamma)$ virtually fibres.

In optimal transport, quadratic regularization is an alternative to entropic regularization when sparse couplings or small regularization parameters are desired. Here quadratic regularization means that transport couplings are penalized by the squared $L^2$ norm, or equivalently the $\chi^2$ divergence. While a number of computational approaches have been shown to work in practice, quadratic regularization is analytically less tractable than entropic, and we are not aware of a previous theoretical convergence rate analysis. We focus on the gradient descent algorithm for the dual transport problem in continuous and semi-discrete settings. This problem is convex but not strongly convex; its solutions are the potential functions that approximate the Kantorovich potentials of unregularized optimal transport. The gradient descent steps are straightforward to implement, and stable for small regularization parameter -- in contrast to Sinkhorn's algorithm in the entropic setting. Our main result is that gradient descent converges linearly; that is, the $L^2$ distance between the iterates and the limiting potentials decreases exponentially fast. Our analysis centers on the linearization of the gradient descent operator at the optimum and uses functional-analytic arguments to bound its spectrum. These techniques seem to be novel in this area and are substantially different from the approaches familiar in entropic optimal transport.

A transport approach to the cutoff phenomenon

Substantial progress has recently been made in the understanding of the cutoff phenomenon for Markov processes, using an information-theoretic statistics known as varentropy [Sal23; Sal24; Sal25a; PS25]. In the present paper, we propose an alternative approach which bypasses the use of varentropy and exploits instead a new W-TV transport inequality, combined with a classical parabolic regularization estimate [BGL01; OV01]. While currently restricted to non-negatively curved processes on smooth spaces, our argument no longer requires the chain rule, nor any approximate version thereof. As applications, we recover the main result of [Sal25a] establishing cutoff for the log-concave Langevin dynamics, and extend the conclusion to a widely-used discrete-time sampling algorithm known as the Proximal Sampler.

Let $\mathscr A$ be the Steenrod algebra over the field of characteristic two, $\mathbb F_2.$ Denote by $GL(q)$ the general linear group of rank $q$ over $\mathbb F_2.$ The algebraic transfer, introduced by W. Singer [Math. Z. 202 (1989), 493-523], is a rather effective tool for unraveling the intricate structure of the (mod-2) cohomology of the Steenrod algebra, ${\rm Ext}_{\mathscr A}^{q,*}(\mathbb F_2, \mathbb F_2).$ The Kameko homomorphism is one of the useful tools to study the dimension of the domain of the Singer transfer. Singer conjectured that the algebraic transfer is always a monomorphism, but this remains open for all homology degrees $q\geq 5.$ In this paper, by constructing a novel algorithm implemented in the computer algebra system OSCAR for computing $GL(q)$-invariants of the kernel of the Kameko homomorphism, we disprove Singer's conjecture for bidegree $(6,6+36).$

Dynamical Systems (math.DS)
Consider the geodesic flow on a closed rank one manifold of nonpositive curvature. For certain Hölder continuous potential, there exists a unique equilibrium state by \cite{BCFT}. In this paper, we introduce the notions of core limit set, regular radial limit set and uniformly recurrent and regular vectors, and then construct a family of Patterson-Sullivan measures on the boundary at infinity in two separate settings. Then we give an explicit construction of the above unique equilibrium state using Patterson-Sullivan measures. This enables us to prove the Bernoulli property of the equilibrium states. Using the Patterson-Sullivan construction and mixing properties of equilibrium states, we count the number of free homotopy classes with weights in nonpositive curvature.

Almost all binary forms of degree $\geq 3$ fail to represent a fixed integer
Diego Marques

Subjects:
Number Theory (math.NT)
We prove that for any fixed integer \( n \geq 3 \) and nonzero integer \( m \), the proportion of integral binary forms of degree \( n \) that represent \( m \) tends to zero as the height tends to infinity. In fact, almost all such forms fail to represent \( m \). Our method uses lattice point counting and geometric methods, including Davenport's lemma and estimates for volumes of hyperplane sections of cubes, together with an analysis of the distribution of rational points on such hyperplanes. The result also holds when restricted to irreducible forms.

Probability (math.PR); Dynamical Systems (math.DS)
Given an orthogonally invariant probability measure on $GL(d,\mathbb{R})$, Mike Shub asked whether the average product of the $k$ top eigenvalues in the ensemble can be lower bounded by the average distortion along $k$ dimensional Grassmanians. Recently, Armentano, Chinta, Sahi, and Shub provided partial progress, however they attach a constant $c_{d,k} \to 0 as d \to \infty$. In this paper, by invoking the Single Ring Theorem and sequels, we show the conjecture asymptotically for the spectral radius, in particular, $c_{d,k} \to 1$ as $d \to \infty$, and $k = 1$.

We use a 2-categorical version of (de-)equivariantization to classify (3+1)d topological orders with a finite $G$-symmetry. In particular, we argue that (3+1)d fermionic topological order with $G$-symmetry correspond to $\mathbf{2SVect}$-enriched $G$-crossed braided fusion 2-categories. We then show that the categorical data necessary to define these theories agrees with that arising from a fermionic generalization of the Wang-Wen-Witten construction of bosonic topological theories with $G$-symmetry saturating an anomaly. More generally, we also explain how 2-categorical (de-) equivariantization yields a classification of all braided fusion 2-categories.

Let a finite set of points $\{\xi_1,...,\xi_k\}$ be chosen in a metric space $(X,d)$, and let the squared distance matrix $\mathfrak{D}=(\mathfrak{D}(\xi_i,\xi_j)^2)_{i,j=1}^{k}$ be constructed from them. We propose a geometric approach to studying the spectral properties of squared distance matrices of infinite size, constructed from a countable set of points $\{\xi_k\}_{k\in \mathbb{Z}}$ on Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$. We move from the discrete problem to a continuous one using walk matrices. We describe the structure of the spectrum and study the properties of spectral flows.

We give a sufficient condition for an $\mathbb{S}^1$-bundle over a $3$-manifold to admit an immersion (or embedding) into $\mathbb{C}^3$ so that its complex tangencies define an Engel structure. In particular, every oriented $\mathbb{S}^1$-bundle over a closed, oriented $3$-manifold admits such an immersion. If the bundle is trivial, this immersion can be chosen to be an embedding and, moreover, infinitely many pairwise smoothly non-isotopic embeddings of this type can be constructed. These are the first examples of compact submanifolds of $\mathbb{C}^3$ whose complex tangencies are Engel, answering a question of Y. Eliashberg.

Active Sequential Hypothesis Testing with Non-Homogeneous Costs

Comments:

Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT)
We study the Non-Homogeneous Sequential Hypothesis Testing (NHSHT), where a single active Decision-Maker (DM) selects actions with heterogeneous positive costs to identify the true hypothesis under an average error constraint \(\delta\), while minimizing expected total cost paid. Under standard arguments, we show that the objective decomposes into the product of the mean number of samples and the mean per-action cost induced by the policy. This leads to a key design principle: one should optimize the ratio of expectations (expected information gain per expected cost) rather than the expectation of per-step information-per-cost ("bit-per-buck"), which can be suboptimal. We adapt the Chernoff scheme to NHSHT, preserving its classical \(\log 1/\delta\) scaling. In simulations, the adapted scheme reduces mean cost by up to 50\% relative to the classic Chernoff policy and by up to 90\% relative to the naive bit-per-buck heuristic.

JD.com Improves Fulfillment Efficiency with Data-driven Integrated Assortment Planning and Inventory Allocation

Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
This paper presents data-driven approaches for integrated assortment planning and inventory allocation that significantly improve fulfillment efficiency at JD\,.com, a leading E-commerce company. JD\,.com uses a two-level distribution network that includes regional distribution centers (RDCs) and front distribution centers (FDCs). Selecting products to stock at FDCs and then optimizing daily inventory allocation from RDCs to FDCs is critical to improving fulfillment efficiency, which is crucial for enhancing customer experiences. For assortment planning, we propose efficient algorithms to maximize the number of orders that can be fulfilled by FDCs (local fulfillment). For inventory allocation, we develop a novel end-to-end algorithm that integrates forecasting, optimization, and simulation to minimize lost sales and inventory transfer costs. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our methods outperform existing approaches, increasing local order fulfillment rates by 0.54% and our inventory allocation algorithm increases FDC demand satisfaction rates by 1.05%. Considering the high-volume operations of JD\,.com, with millions of weekly orders per region, these improvements yield substantial benefits beyond the company's established supply chain system. Implementation across JD\,.com's network has reduced costs, improved stock availability, and increased local order fulfillment rates for millions of orders annually.

Labelled growth rates of $ω$-categorical structures and applications in choiceless set theory

Logic (math.LO); Combinatorics (math.CO)
We study the labelled growth rate of an $\omega$-categorical structure $\mathfrak{A}$, i.e., the number of orbits of $Aut(\mathfrak{A})$ on $n$-tuples of distinct elements, and show that the model-theoretic property of monadic stability yields a gap in the spectrum of allowable labelled growth rates. As a further application, we obtain gap in the spectrum of allowable labelled growth rates in hereditary graph classes, with no a priori assumption of $\omega$-categoricity. We also establish a way to translate results about labelled growth rates of $\omega$-categorical structures into combinatorial statements about sets with weak finiteness properties in the absence of the axiom of choice, and derive several results from this translation.

The Power Contamination Problem on Grids Revisited: Optimality, Combinatorics, and Links to Integer Sequences
El-Mehdi Mehiri, Mohammed L. Nadji
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO); Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM)
This paper presents a combinatorial study of the power contamination problem, a dynamic variant of power domination modeled on grid graphs. We resolve a conjecture posed by Ainouche and Bouroubi (2021) by proving it is false and instead establish the exact value of the power contamination number on grid graphs. Furthermore, we derive recurrence relations for this number and initiate the enumeration of optimal contamination sets. We prove that the number of optimal solutions for specific grid families corresponds to well-known integer sequences, including those counting ternary words with forbidden subwords and the large Schröder numbers. This work settles the fundamental combinatorial questions of the power contamination problem on grids and reveals its rich connections to classical combinatorics.

In this paper, we introduce the notions of dualizing complexes and balanced dualizing complexes over $\mathbb{Z}$-algebras. We prove that a noetherian connected $\mathbb{Z}$-algebra $A$ admits a balanced dualizing complex if and only if $A$ satisfies Artin-Zhang's $\chi$-condition, has finite local cohomology dimension, and possesses symmetric derived torsion as a bigraded $A$-$A$-bimodule. As an application of our study of dualizing complexes, we show that any smooth noncommutative projective scheme associated to a $\mathbb{Z}$-algebra with a balanced dualizing complex admits a Serre functor.

Fix a smooth Morse function $U\colon \mathbb{R}^{d}\to\mathbb{R}$ with finitely many critical points, and consider the solution of the stochastic differential equation \[ d\boldsymbol{x}_{\epsilon}(t)=-\nabla U(\boldsymbol{x}_{\epsilon}(t))\,dt \,+\,\sqrt{2\epsilon}\, d\boldsymbol{w}_{t}\,, \] where $(\boldsymbol{w}_{t})_{t\ge0}$ represents a $d$-dimensional Brownian motion, and $\epsilon>0$ a small parameter. Denote by $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^{d})$ the space of probability measures on $\mathbb{R}^d$, and by $\mathcal{I}_{\epsilon} \colon \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^{d})\to[0,\,\infty]$ the Donsker--Varadhan level two large deviations rate functional. We express $\mathcal{I}_\epsilon$ as $\mathcal{I}_\epsilon = \epsilon^{-1} \mathcal{J}^{(-1)} + \mathcal{J}^{(0)} + \sum_{1\le p\le \mathfrak{q}} (1/\theta^{(p)}_\epsilon) \, \mathcal{J}^{(p)}$, where $\mathcal{J}^{(p)}\colon \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^d) \to [0,+\infty]$ stand for rate functionals independent of $\epsilon$ and $\theta^{(p)}_\epsilon$ for sequences such that $\theta^{(1)}_\epsilon \to\infty$, $\theta^{(p)}_\epsilon / \theta^{(p+1)}_\epsilon \to 0$ for $1\le p< \mathfrak{q}$. The speeds $\theta^{(p)}_\epsilon$ correspond to the time-scales at which the diffusion $\boldsymbol{x}_{\epsilon}(\cdot)$ exhibits a metastable behaviour, while the functional $\mathcal{J}^{(p)}$ represent the level two, large deviations rate functionals of the finite-state, continuous-time Markov chains which describe the evolution of the diffusion $\boldsymbol{x}_{\epsilon}(\cdot)$ among the wells in the time-scale $\theta^{(p)}_\epsilon$.

Rich Vehicle Routing Problem in Disaster Management enabling Temporally-causal Transhipments across Multi-Modal Transportation Network

Subjects:

A rich vehicle routing problem is considered, allowing multiple trips of heterogeneous vehicles stationed at geographically distributed vehicle depots having access to different modes of transportation. The problem arises from the real-world requirement of optimizing the disaster response time by minimizing the makespan of vehicular routes. Multiple diversely-functional vertices are considered, including Transhipment Ports as inter-modal resource transfer stations. Both simultaneous and split pickup and delivery are considered, for multiple cargo types, along with Vehicle-Cargo and Transhipment Port-Cargo compatibilities. The superiority of the proposed cascaded minimization approach is demonstrated over the existing makespan minimization approaches through our developed Mixed-Integer Linear Programming formulation. To solve the problem quickly for practical implementation in a Disaster Management-specific Decision Support System, an extensive Heuristic Algorithm is devised which utilizes Decision Tree based structuring of possible routes; the Decision Tree approach helps to inherently capture the compatibility issues, while also explore the solution space through stochastic weights. Preferential generation of small route elements is performed, which are integrated into route clusters; we consider multiple different logical integration approaches, as well as shuffling the logics to simultaneously produce multiple independent solutions. Finally, perturbations of the different solutions are done to find better neighbouring solutions. The computational performance of the PSR-GIP Heuristic, on our created novel datasets, indicates that it is able to give good solutions swiftly for practical problems involving large integer instances that the MILP is unable to solve.

Blind Network Revenue Management and Bandits with Knapsacks under Limited Switches

This paper studies the impact of limited switches on resource-constrained dynamic pricing with demand learning. We focus on the classical price-based blind network revenue management problem and extend our results to the bandits with knapsacks problem. In both settings, a decision maker faces stochastic and distributionally unknown demand, and must allocate finite initial inventory across multiple resources over time. In addition to standard resource constraints, we impose a switching constraint that limits the number of action changes over the time horizon. We establish matching upper and lower bounds on the optimal regret and develop computationally efficient limited-switch algorithms that achieve it. We show that the optimal regret rate is fully characterized by a piecewise-constant function of the switching budget, which further depends on the number of resource constraints. Our results highlight the fundamental role of resource constraints in shaping the statistical complexity of online learning under limited switches. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our algorithms maintain strong cumulative reward performance while significantly reducing the number of switches.

Spectral Independence and Local-to-Global Techniques for Optimal Mixing of Markov Chains

Comments:
100 pages. Significant generalization of previous version of monograph, including recent results. Comments appreciated
Subjects:
Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM); Probability (math.PR)
This monograph is an exposition on an exciting new technique known as spectral independence, which has been instrumental in analyzing the convergence rate of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. For a high-dimensional distribution defined on labelings of the vertices of an n-vertex graph, the spectral independence condition, introduced by Anari, Liu, and Oveis Gharan (2020), is a bound on the maximum eigenvalue of the nxn influence matrix whose entries capture the influence between pairs of vertices (closely related to the covariance between the variables). In the first part of the monograph, we present results showing that spectral independence (and related techniques) imply fast mixing of simple Markov chains such as the Gibbs sampler. These proofs utilize local-to-global theorems which we will detail in this work.
We focus on two applications: the hard-core model on independent sets of a graph (which is a binary graphical model) and random bases of a matroid. We demonstrate several methods for establishing spectral independence, including the correlation decay approach introduced by Weitz (2006) and the analytic approach introduced by Barvinok (2015) using zero-freeness of the associated complex-valued partition function. As a consequence of the techniques presented in this monograph we obtain fast mixing of the Gibbs sampler on general graphs in the so-called tree-uniqueness region, polynomial-time mixing on general graphs at the critical point for the uniqueness threshold, and polynomial-time mixing on random regular graphs beyond the uniqueness threshold. We also utilize the local-to-global framework of spectral independence and the Trickle-Down theorem of Oppenheim (2018) to prove fast mixing of the bases-exchange walk for generating a random basis of an arbitrary matroid, which was established by Anari, Liu, Oveis Gharan and Vinzant (2019).

Non-Clifford and parallelizable fault-tolerant logical gates on constant and almost-constant rate homological quantum LDPC codes via higher symmetries

We study parallel fault-tolerant quantum computing for families of homological quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes defined on 3-manifolds with constant or almost-constant encoding rate. We derive generic formula for a transversal $T$ gate of color codes on general 3-manifolds, which acts as collective non-Clifford logical CCZ gates on any triplet of logical qubits with their logical-$X$ membranes having a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ triple intersection at a single point. The triple intersection number is a topological invariant, which also arises in the path integral of the emergent higher symmetry operator in a topological quantum field theory: the $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$ gauge theory. Moreover, the transversal $S$ gate of the color code corresponds to a higher-form symmetry supported on a codimension-1 submanifold, giving rise to exponentially many addressable and parallelizable logical CZ gates. A construction of constant-depth circuits of the above logical gates via cup product cohomology operation is also presented for three copies of identical toric codes on arbitrary 3-manifolds. We have developed a generic formalism to compute the triple intersection invariants for 3-manifolds. We further develop three types of LDPC codes supporting such logical gates: (1) A quasi-hyperbolic code from the product of 2D hyperbolic surface and a circle, with almost-constant rate $k/n=O(1/\log(n))$ and $O(\log(n))$ distance; (2) A homological fibre bundle code with $O(1/\log^{\frac{1}{2}}(n))$ rate and $O(\log^{\frac{1}{2}}(n))$ distance; (3) A specific family of 3D hyperbolic codes: the Torelli mapping torus code, constructed from mapping tori of a pseudo-Anosov element in the Torelli subgroup, which has constant rate while the distance scaling is currently unknown. We then show a generic constant-overhead scheme for applying a parallelizable universal gate set with the aid of logical-$X$ measurements.

Computing shortest closed curves on non-orientable surfaces

Subjects:

We initiate the study of computing shortest non-separating simple closed curves with some given topological properties on non-orientable surfaces. While, for orientable surfaces, any two non-separating simple closed curves are related by a self-homeomorphism of the surface, and computing shortest such curves has been vastly studied, for non-orientable ones the classification of non-separating simple closed curves up to ambient homeomorphism is subtler, depending on whether the curve is one-sided or two-sided, and whether it is orienting or not (whether it cuts the surface into an orientable one).
We prove that computing a shortest orienting (weakly) simple closed curve on a non-orientable combinatorial surface is NP-hard but fixed-parameter tractable in the genus of the surface. In contrast, we can compute a shortest non-separating non-orienting (weakly) simple closed curve with given sidedness in $g^{O(1)}.n\log n$ time, where $g$ is the genus and $n$ the size of the surface.
For these algorithms, we develop tools that can be of independent interest, to compute a variation on canonical systems of loops for non-orientable surfaces based on the computation of an orienting curve, and some covering spaces that are essentially quotients of homology covers.

We explore an Art Gallery variant where each point of a polygon must be seen by k guards, and guards cannot see through other guards. Surprisingly, even covering convex polygons under this variant is not straightforward. For example, covering every point in a triangle k=4 times (a 4-cover) requires 5 guards, and achieving a 10-cover requires 12 guards. Our main result is tight bounds on k-covering a convex polygon of n vertices, for all k and n. The proofs of both upper and lower bounds are nontrivial. We also obtain bounds for simple polygons, leaving tight bounds an open problem.

The deformation approach of arXiv:2104.07816 for computing zeta functions of one-parameter Calabi-Yau threefolds is generalised to cover also multiparameter manifolds. Consideration of the multiparameter case requires the development of an improved formalism. This allows us, among other things, to make progress on some issues left open in previous work, such as the treatment of apparent and conifold singularities and changes of coordinates. We also discuss the efficient numerical computation of the zeta functions. As examples, we compute the zeta functions of the two-parameter mirror octic, a non-symmetric split of the quintic threefold also with two parameters, and the $S_5$ symmetric five-parameter Hulek-Verrill manifolds. These examples allow us to exhibit the several new types of geometries for which our methods make practical computations possible. They also act as consistency checks, as our results reproduce and extend those of arXiv:hep-th/0409202 and arXiv:math/0304169. To make the methods developed here more approachable, a Mathematica package "CY3Zeta" for computing the zeta functions of Calabi-Yau threefolds, which is attached to this paper, is presented.

In this work, we propose a new approach called ``stationary reduction method based on nonisospectral deformation of orthogonal polynomials" for deriving discrete Painlevé-type (d-P-type) equations. We apply this approach to (bi)orthogonal polynomials satisfying ordinary orthogonality, $(1,m)$-biorthogonality, generalized Laurent biorthogonality, Cauchy biorthogonality and partial-skew orthogonality. As a result, several seemingly novel classes of high order d-P-type equations or integrable difference systems with potential relations with new d-P-type equations, along with their particular solutions and respective Lax pairs, are derived. Notably, the derived integrable difference system related to the Cauchy biorthogonality is a stationary reduction of a nonisospectral generalization involving the first two flows of the Toda hierarchy of CKP type. Additionally, the integrable difference system related to the partial-skew orthogonality is associated with the nonisospectral Toda hierarchy of BKP type, and it is found to admit a solution expressed in terms of Pfaffians.

We consider chiral, generally nonlinear density waves in one dimension, modelling the bosonized edge modes of a two-dimensional fermionic topological insulator. Using the coincidence between bosonization and Lie-Poisson dynamics on an affine U(1) group, we show that wave profiles which are periodic in time produce Berry phases accumulated by the underlying fermionic field. These phases can be evaluated in closed form for any Hamiltonian, and they serve as a diagnostic of nonlinearity. As an explicit example, we discuss the Korteweg-de Vries equation, viewed as a model of nonlinear quantum Hall edge modes.

Leveraging Perceptual Scores for Dataset Pruning in Computer Vision Tasks

Subjects:
Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV); Information Theory (cs.IT)
In this paper we propose a score of an image to use for coreset selection in image classification and semantic segmentation tasks. The score is the entropy of an image as approximated by the bits-per-pixel of its compressed version. Thus the score is intrinsic to an image and does not require supervision or training. It is very simple to compute and readily available as all images are stored in a compressed format. The motivation behind our choice of score is that most other scores proposed in literature are expensive to compute. More importantly, we want a score that captures the perceptual complexity of an image. Entropy is one such measure, images with clutter tend to have a higher entropy. However sampling only low entropy iconic images, for example, leads to biased learning and an overall decrease in test performance with current deep learning models. To mitigate the bias we use a graph based method that increases the spatial diversity of the selected samples. We show that this simple score yields good results, particularly for semantic segmentation tasks.

Title:
An Optimal Algorithm for the Stacker Crane Problem on Fixed Topologies

Subjects:

The Stacker Crane Problem (SCP) is a variant of the Traveling Salesman Problem. In SCP, pairs of pickup and delivery points are designated on a graph, and a crane must visit these points to move objects from each pickup location to its respective delivery point. The goal is to minimize the total distance traveled. SCP is known to be NP-hard, even on trees. The only positive results, in terms of polynomial-time solvability, apply to graphs that are topologically equivalent to a path or a cycle.
We propose an algorithm that is optimal for each fixed topology, running in near-linear time. This is achieved by demonstrating that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) when parameterized by both the cycle rank and the number of branch vertices.

Title:
Global Search for Optimal Low Thrust Spacecraft Trajectories using Diffusion Models and the Indirect Method
Jannik Graebner, Ryne Beeson
Subjects:
Systems and Control (eess.SY); Machine Learning (cs.LG); Optimization and Control (math.OC)
Long time-duration low-thrust nonlinear optimal spacecraft trajectory global search is a computationally and time expensive problem characterized by clustering patterns in locally optimal solutions. During preliminary mission design, mission parameters are subject to frequent changes, necessitating that trajectory designers efficiently generate high-quality control solutions for these new scenarios. Generative machine learning models can be trained to learn how the solution structure varies with respect to a conditional parameter, thereby accelerating the global search for missions with updated parameters. In this work, state-of-the-art diffusion models are integrated with the indirect approach for trajectory optimization within a global search framework. This framework is tested on two low-thrust transfers of different complexity in the circular restricted three-body problem. By generating and analyzing a training data set, we develop mathematical relations and techniques to understand the complex structures in the costate domain of locally optimal solutions for these problems. A diffusion model is trained on this data and successfully accelerates the global search for both problems. The model predicts how the costate solution structure changes, based on the maximum spacecraft thrust magnitude. Warm-starting a numerical solver with diffusion model samples for the costates at the initial time increases the number of solutions generated per minute for problems with unseen thrust magnitudes by one to two orders of magnitude in comparison to samples from a uniform distribution and from an adjoint control transformation.

Title:
Bayesian Model Averaging in Causal Instrumental Variable Models
Gregor Steiner, Mark Steel
Subjects:
Methodology (stat.ME); Econometrics (econ.EM); Statistics Theory (math.ST)
Instrumental variables are a popular tool to infer causal effects under unobserved confounding, but choosing suitable instruments is challenging in practice. We propose gIVBMA, a Bayesian model averaging procedure that addresses this challenge by averaging across different sets of instrumental variables and covariates in a structural equation model. Our approach extends previous work through a scale-invariant prior structure and accommodates non-Gaussian outcomes and treatments, offering greater flexibility than existing methods. The computational strategy uses conditional Bayes factors to update models separately for the outcome and treatments. We prove that this model selection procedure is consistent. By explicitly accounting for model uncertainty, gIVBMA allows instruments and covariates to switch roles and provides robustness against invalid instruments. In simulation experiments, gIVBMA outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. We demonstrate its usefulness in two empirical applications: the effects of malaria and institutions on income per capita and the returns to schooling. A software implementation of gIVBMA is available in Julia.

Title:
Enabling Local Neural Operators to perform Equation-Free System-Level Analysis

Neural Operators (NOs) provide a powerful framework for computations involving physical laws that can be modelled by (integro-) partial differential equations (PDEs), directly learning maps between infinite-dimensional function spaces that bypass both the explicit equation identification and their subsequent numerical solving. Still, NOs have so far primarily been employed to explore the dynamical behavior as surrogates of brute-force temporal simulations/predictions. Their potential for systematic rigorous numerical system-level tasks, such as fixed-point, stability, and bifurcation analysis - crucial for predicting irreversible transitions in real-world phenomena - remains largely unexplored. Toward this aim, inspired by the Equation-Free multiscale framework, we propose and implement a framework that integrates (local) NOs with advanced iterative numerical methods in the Krylov subspace, so as to perform efficient system-level stability and bifurcation analysis of large-scale dynamical systems. Beyond fixed point, stability, and bifurcation analysis enabled by local in time NOs, we also demonstrate the usefulness of local in space as well as in space-time ("patch") NOs in accelerating the computer-aided analysis of spatiotemporal dynamics. We illustrate our framework via three nonlinear PDE benchmarks: the 1D Allen-Cahn equation, which undergoes multiple concatenated pitchfork bifurcations; the Liouville-Bratu-Gelfand PDE, which features a saddle-node tipping point; and the FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) model, consisting of two coupled PDEs that exhibit both Hopf and saddle-node bifurcations.

Continuous Temporal Learning of Probability Distributions via Neural ODEs with Applications in Continuous Glucose Monitoring Data

Modeling the dynamics of probability distributions from time-dependent data samples is a fundamental problem in many fields, including digital health. The goal is to analyze how the distribution of a biomarker, such as glucose, changes over time and how these changes may reflect the progression of chronic diseases such as diabetes. We introduce a probabilistic model based on a Gaussian mixture that captures the evolution of a continuous-time stochastic process. Our approach combines a nonparametric estimate of the distribution, obtained with Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), and a Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (Neural ODE) that governs the temporal evolution of the mixture weights. The model is highly interpretable, detects subtle distribution shifts, and remains computationally efficient. We illustrate the broad utility of our approach in a 26-week clinical trial that treats all continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) time series as the primary outcome. This method enables rigorous longitudinal comparisons between the treatment and control arms and yields characterizations that conventional summary-based clinical trials analytical methods typically do not capture.

A primary goal of string phenomenology is to identify realistic four-dimensional physics within the landscape of string theory solutions. In F-theory, such solutions are encoded in the geometry of singular elliptic fibrations, whose study often requires particularly challenging and cumbersome computations. In this work, we introduce FTheoryTools, a novel software module integrated into the OSCAR computer algebra system, designed to automate the complex and tedious tasks involved in F-theory model building. Key features of FTheoryTools include the enumeration of G4-fluxes, the capability to perform blowups on arbitrary (including non-toric) loci, and a literature database of existing F-theory constructions employing a MaRDI-based data format for enhanced collaboration and reproducibility. As a demonstration of its power, we present a stress test by applying FTheoryTools to the challenging F-theory geometry with most flux vacua (arXiv:1511.03209). Our results illustrate the potential of FTheoryTools to streamline F-theory research and pave the way for future developments in the computational study of string phenomenology.

The occurrence of Landau levels in quantum mechanics when a charged particle is subjected to a uniform magnetic field is well known. Considering the recent interest in the electronic properties of graphene, which admits a dispersion relation which is linear in the momentum near the Dirac points, we revisit the problem of Landau levels in the spirit of the Dirac Hamiltonian and ask if there are certain non-uniform magnetic fields which also lead to a spectrum consisting of the Landau levels. The answer, as we show, is in the affirmative. In particular, by considering isospectral deformations of the uniform magnetic field, we present explicit analytical expressions for non-uniform magnetic fields that are strictly isospectral to their uniform counterpart, thus supporting the Landau levels.

Title:
Random time-shift approximation enables hierarchical Bayesian inference of mechanistic within-host viral dynamics models on large datasets

Applications (stat.AP); Probability (math.PR)
Mechanistic mathematical models of within-host viral dynamics are tools for understanding how a virus' biology and its interaction with the immune system shape the infectivity of a host. The biology of the process is encoded by the structure and parameters of the model that can be inferred statistically by fitting to viral load data. The main drawback of mechanistic models is that this inference is computationally expensive because the model must be repeatedly solved. This limits the size of the datasets that can be considered or the complexity of the models fitted. In this paper we develop a much cheaper inference method by implementing a novel approximation of the model dynamics that uses a combination of random and deterministic processes. This approximation also properly accounts for process noise early in the infection when cell and virion numbers are small, which is important for the viral dynamics but often overlooked. Our method runs on a consumer laptop and is fast enough to facilitate a full hierarchical Bayesian treatment of the problem with sharing of information to allow for individual level parameter differences. We apply our method to simulated datasets and a reanalysis of COVID-19 monitoring data in an National Basketball Association cohort of 163 individuals.

We theoretically establish that non-Hermitian perturbations induce a topological transformation of point-like Dirac monopoles into extended monopole distributions, characterized by distinct charge configurations emergent from three distinct Berry connection forms. Using piecewise adiabatic evolution, we confirm the validity of these configurations through observations of complex geometric phases. Most critically, we find a quantitative relation $\Delta \phi_d = \Delta \phi_g$, which quantifies how cumulative minute energy differences (\(\Delta \phi_d\)) manifest as geometric phase shifts (\(\Delta \phi_g\)) uniquely in non-Hermitian systems. We further propose a scheme leveraging soliton dynamics in dissipative two-component Bose-Einstein condensates, enabling direct measurement of these topological signatures. These results establish a milestone for understanding Dirac monopole charge distributions and measuring complex geometric phases in non-Hermitian systems, with far-reaching implications for topological quantum computing and non-Hermitian photonics.

Subjects:

This paper presents an enhanced post-quantum key agreement protocol based on Rényi entropy, addressing vulnerabilities in the original construction while preserving information-theoretic security properties. We develop a theoretical framework leveraging entropy-preserving operations and secret-shared verification to achieve provable security against quantum adversaries. Through entropy amplification techniques and quantum-resistant commitments, the protocol establishes $2^{128}$ quantum security guarantees under the quantum random oracle model. Key innovations include a confidentiality-preserving verification mechanism using distributed polynomial commitments, tightened min-entropy bounds with guaranteed non-negativity, and composable security proofs in the quantum universal composability framework. Unlike computational approaches, our method provides information-theoretic security without hardness assumptions while maintaining polynomial complexity. Theoretical analysis demonstrates resilience against known quantum attack vectors, including Grover-accelerated brute force and quantum memory attacks. The protocol achieves parameterization for 128-bit quantum security with efficient $\mathcal{O}(n^{2})$ communication complexity. Extensions to secure multiparty computation and quantum network applications are established, providing a foundation for long-term cryptographic security.

Interconnection studies require solving numerous instances of the AC load or power flow (AC PF) problem to simulate diverse scenarios as power systems navigate the ongoing energy transition. To expedite such studies, this work leverages recent advances in quantum computing to find or predict AC PF solutions using a variational quantum circuit (VQC). VQCs are trainable models that run on modern-day noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware to accomplish elaborate optimization and machine learning (ML) tasks. Our first contribution is to pose a single instance of the AC PF as a nonlinear least-squares fit over the VQC trainable parameters (weights) and solve it using a hybrid classical/quantum computing approach. The second contribution is to feed PF specifications as features into a data-embedded VQC and train the resultant quantum ML (QML) model to predict general PF solutions. The third contribution is to develop a novel protocol to efficiently measure AC-PF quantum observables by exploiting the graph structure of a power network. Preliminary numerical tests indicate that the proposed VQC models attain enhanced prediction performance over a deep neural network despite using much fewer weights. The proposed quantum AC-PF framework sets the foundations for addressing more elaborate grid tasks via quantum computing.

Rotatable Antenna Aided Mixed Near-Field and Far-Field Communications in the Upper Mid-Band: Interference Analysis and Joint Optimization
Yunpu Zhang, Changsheng You, Hing Cheung So, Dusit Niyato
Comments:
13 pages, 12 figures
Subjects:
Signal Processing (eess.SP); Information Theory (cs.IT)
In this paper, we propose to leverage rotatable antennas (RAs) for improving the communication performance in mixed near-field and far-field communication systems by exploiting a new spatial degree-of-freedom (DoF) offered by antenna rotation to mitigate complex near-field interference and mixed-field interference. Specifically, we investigate a modular RA-enabled mixed-field downlink communication system, where a base station (BS) consisting of multiple RA subarrays communicates with multiple near-field users in the presence of several legacy far-field users. We formulate an optimization problem to maximize the sum-rate of the near-field users by jointly optimizing the power allocation and rotation angles of all subarrays at the BS. To gain useful insights into the effect of RAs on mixed-field communications, we first analyze a special case where all subarrays share the same rotation angle and obtain closed-form expressions for the rotation-aware normalized near-field interference and the rotation-aware normalized mixed-field interference using the Fresnel integrals. We then analytically reveal that array rotation effectively suppresses both interference types, thereby significantly enhancing mixed-field communication performance. For the general case involving subarray-wise rotation, we propose an efficient double-layer algorithm to obtain a high-quality solution, where the inner layer optimizes power allocation using the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique, while the outer layer determines the rotation angles of all subarrays via particle swarm optimization (PSO). Finally, numerical results highlight the significant performance gains achieved by RAs over conventional fixed-antenna systems and demonstrate the effectiveness of our developed joint design compared to benchmark schemes.

Perfectly-Private Analog Secure Aggregation in Federated Learning

Comments:
Comments welcome
Subjects:
Machine Learning (cs.LG); Information Theory (cs.IT)
In federated learning, multiple parties train models locally and share their parameters with a central server, which aggregates them to update a global model. To address the risk of exposing sensitive data through local models, secure aggregation via secure multiparty computation has been proposed to enhance privacy. At the same time, perfect privacy can only be achieved by a uniform distribution of the masked local models to be aggregated. This raises a problem when working with real valued data, as there is no measure on the reals that is invariant under the masking operation, and hence information leakage is bound to occur. Shifting the data to a finite field circumvents this problem, but as a downside runs into an inherent accuracy complexity tradeoff issue due to fixed point modular arithmetic as opposed to floating point numbers that can simultaneously handle numbers of varying magnitudes. In this paper, a novel secure parameter aggregation method is proposed that employs the torus rather than a finite field. This approach guarantees perfect privacy for each party's data by utilizing the uniform distribution on the torus, while avoiding accuracy losses. Experimental results show that the new protocol performs similarly to the model without secure aggregation while maintaining perfect privacy. Compared to the finite field secure aggregation, the torus-based protocol can in some cases significantly outperform it in terms of model accuracy and cosine similarity, hence making it a safer choice.

Privacy-Preserving Uncertainty Disclosure for Facilitating Enhanced Energy Storage Dispatch
Ning Qi, Xiaolong Jin, Kai Hou, Zeyu Liu, Hongjie Jia, Wei Wei
Subjects:
Systems and Control (eess.SY); Optimization and Control (math.OC)
This paper proposes a novel privacy-preserving uncertainty disclosure framework, enabling system operators to release marginal value function bounds to reduce the conservativeness of interval forecast and mitigate excessive withholding, thereby enhancing storage dispatch and social welfare. We develop a risk-averse storage arbitrage model based on stochastic dynamic programming, explicitly accounting for uncertainty intervals in value function training. Real-time marginal value function bounds are derived using a rolling-horizon chance-constrained economic dispatch formulation. We rigorously prove that the bounds reliably cap the true opportunity cost and dynamically converge to the hindsight value. We verify that both the marginal value function and its bounds monotonically decrease with the state of charge (SoC) and increase with uncertainty, providing a theoretical basis for risk-averse strategic behaviors and SoC-dependent designs. An adjusted storage dispatch algorithm is further designed using these bounds. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework via an agent-based simulation on the ISO-NE test system. Under 50% renewable capacity and 35% storage capacity, the proposed bounds enhance storage response by 38.91% and reduce the optimality gap to 3.91% through improved interval predictions. Additionally, by mitigating excessive withholding, the bounds yield an average system cost reduction of 0.23% and an average storage profit increase of 13.22%. These benefits further scale with higher prediction conservativeness, storage capacity, and system uncertainty.

A Kernel-based Stochastic Approximation Framework for Nonlinear Operator Learning

Comments:
34 pages, 3 figures
Subjects:
Machine Learning (stat.ML); Machine Learning (cs.LG); Functional Analysis (math.FA); Numerical Analysis (math.NA); Statistics Theory (math.ST)
We develop a stochastic approximation framework for learning nonlinear operators between infinite-dimensional spaces utilizing general Mercer operator-valued kernels. Our framework encompasses two key classes: (i) compact kernels, which admit discrete spectral decompositions, and (ii) diagonal kernels of the form $K(x,x')=k(x,x')T$, where $k$ is a scalar-valued kernel and $T$ is a positive operator on the output space. This broad setting induces expressive vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs) that generalize the classical $K=kI$ paradigm, thereby enabling rich structural modeling with rigorous theoretical guarantees. To address target operators lying outside the RKHS, we introduce vector-valued interpolation spaces to precisely quantify misspecification error. Within this framework, we establish dimension-free polynomial convergence rates, demonstrating that nonlinear operator learning can overcome the curse of dimensionality. The use of general operator-valued kernels further allows us to derive rates for intrinsically nonlinear operator learning, going beyond the linear-type behavior inherent in diagonal constructions of $K=kI$. Importantly, this framework accommodates a wide range of operator learning tasks, ranging from integral operators such as Fredholm operators to architectures based on encoder-decoder representations. Moreover, we validate its effectiveness through numerical experiments on the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations.
