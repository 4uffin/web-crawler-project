Title:
Deformation Quantization on $\mathbb{R}^d$
Haiqi Wu
Subjects:
Quantum Algebra (math.QA)
The primary aim of this essay, drawn from the author's MMath dissertation at Oxford, is to present and explain Kontsevich's formality theorem. The first two sections introduce the main topic. Sections 3 and 4 discuss Hochschild (co)homology, DGLA, and Maurer-Cartan elements. HKR theorem is stated in section 4, while a proof is deferred to appendix. In Section 5 we talk about L-infinity morphisms. The central result of section 5 gives a penultimate step for solving the problem. We prove the main theorem in section 6.

Title:
Geographic Characterisation of Children's Health and Wellbeing through Vulnerability Indices Using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-Means Clustering
Harriette Phillips, Aiden Price, Kerrie Mengersen
Comments:
61 pages, 7 figures, 5 appendices
Subjects:
General Mathematics (math.GM)
Using Australian children as a case study, this paper aims to develop vulnerability indices to characterise the health and well-being of children aged 0-5 years old. The indices are used to identify differences in children's health and well-being across geographic regions and identify clusters of regions with similar characteristics. The approach is underpinned by two well-known statistical methods, namely Principal Component Analysis and K-Means Clustering. The identification of these regions with similar vulnerability characteristics can then be used to derive new insights into drivers of children's health and well-being and support improved decision-making for services in Australia.

Title:
Quantitative metrics for trait and identity distributions
Leah Hoogstra, Katherine Slyman, Bjorn Sandstede
Subjects:
General Mathematics (math.GM)
Understanding the role of demographic diversity in group settings requires effective quantitative metrics. Intersectional feminist theory has highlighted that demographic identities can intersect in complex ways, but most metrics used to study these traits are one-dimensional. In their paper "Diversity, identity, and data" (2025), Topaz et al. introduced two novel metrics that capture multiple aspects of demographic identities among group members: "intersecting diversity" and "shared identity". We present a mathematical framework to provide probabilistic interpretations for both metrics. Using these interpretations, we prove that these two measures are anti-correlated and establish tight bounds on their possible combined values, demonstrating that there is no clear "optimal" point that maximizes both metrics. We apply these metrics in three case studies on Hollywood movies, the television show "Survivor", and a random sample of North American companies in which we explore their bounds and anti-correlation as well as their relationship to group performance in these settings. By formalizing the mathematical structure for these metrics and demonstrating their empirical relevance, we provide a foundation for researchers across the social sciences, mathematics, and related fields to more precisely quantify distributions of intersecting traits within groups and better understand their implications for group dynamics and performance.

Title:
Sectorial Green Functions in the Ternary Algebra C3 and Their Curved-Space Extension
Bora Aktaş
Subjects:
General Mathematics (math.GM)
Green functions associated with higher-order differential operators typically lead to special-function expressions in curved or bounded geometries, obscuring analytic transparency. In this work we develop the sectorial Green function for the cubic operator $(D^3+1)$ within the ternary algebra $C_3$ (defined by $j^3=-1$). The algebra admits three exponential carriers and divides the complex plane into six Stokes sectors, in each of which the Green kernel assumes a closed exponential--trigonometric form. We compute explicit responses to box and Gaussian sources, extend the construction to higher algebras $C_4$ and $C_5$, and interpret the resulting kernels as propagators for multi-carrier quantum systems. The central novelty is that, unlike the quadratic $(D^2+1)$ case where curved backgrounds induce Bessel or Airy functions, the $C_3$ Green function in curved space reduces exactly to its flat-space form upon reparametrization by the geodesic coordinate. Curvature merely deforms the coordinate without altering the analytic structure, ensuring closed-form transparency even in curved geometries.

Title:
Every sufficiently large odd integer is a sum of two positive perfect squares and a prime
Ricardo Adonis Caraccioli Abrego
Subjects:
General Mathematics (math.GM)
We prove that every sufficiently large odd integer is a sum of two positive squares and a prime. Let R(n) be the number of representations n = x^2 + y^2 + p with x, y >= 1 and p prime. We show that R(n) > 0 for all odd n >= n0 and obtain the asymptotic formula R(n) = S(n) C n / log n, where S(n) > 0 is the singular series and C > 0 is the singular integral. The proof uses the Hardy-Littlewood circle method: on the major arcs we extract the main term, and on the minor arcs we combine an L2 bound for the prime exponential sum (via the Bombieri-Vinogradov theorem, the large sieve, and the Vaughan-Heath-Brown identity) with a fourth moment estimate for the quadratic Weyl sum. A p-adic local analysis, including the 2-adic case, shows S(n) > 0 for odd n. We work with the standard logarithmic weight on primes and pass to the unweighted count by partial summation.

Solving Fermat-type equations over quadratic fields
Begum Gulsah Cakti
Subjects:
Number Theory (math.NT)
This paper applies the modular approach to obtain effectively computable bounds for Fermat-type equations over number fields, while also discussing the differences and obstructions that arise when considering such equations over totally real versus totally complex number fields. We use these techniques to study the generalized Fermat equation $d^ra^p+b^p+c^p=0$ over quadratic fields $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})$ of class number one. Extending the results of Freitas\&Siksek and Turcas, we show that when $d=-3,-11,3,5,7,11,13,19,23$, there is an effective and explicit bound, depending on the field $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})$, such that the latter equation does not have certain types of special solutions. In addition, we obtain effective bounds for $d=-19,-43$, showing that the same equation has no non-trivial solutions of this type. We also discuss, for $d=6,14,21$, the solutions of a variant of the above equation. Our results over imaginary quadratic fields are conjectural. Serre's modularity conjecture and an analogue of Eichler-Shimura over totally complex fields are assumed.

Title:
An EKR Theorem for the Cartesian Product of Complete Graphs
Zaphenath Joseph
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
The Erdős--Ko--Rado theorem states that for $r \leq \frac{n}{2}$, the largest intersecting family of $r$-subsets of $[n]$ is given by fixing a common element in all subsets, which trivially ensures pairwise intersection. We investigate this property for families of independent sets in the Cartesian product of complete graphs, $K_n \times K_m$. Using a novel extension of Katona's cycle method, we prove $K_n \times K_m$ is $r$-EKR when $1 \leq r \leq \frac{\min(m,n)}{2}$, demonstrating the Holroyd--Talbot conjecture holds for this class of well-covered graphs.

4-manifolds and non-existence of open book
Shital Lawande, Kuldeep Saha
Subjects:
Geometric Topology (math.GT)
Following a recent work of Kastenholz, we show existence of infinitely many parallelizable closed oriented 4-manifolds, none of which admit an open book decomposition. This implies there is no analogue of the Giroux correspondence for Engel manifolds. In particular, not every Engel manifold has a supporting open book, in the sense of Colin, Presas and Vogel.

Title:
Computing fault-tolerant metric dimension of graphs using their primary subgraphs
S. Prabhu, Sandi Klavžar, K. Bharani Dharan, S. Radha
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
The metric dimension of a graph is the cardinality of a minimum resolving set, which is the set of vertices such that the distance representations of every vertex with respect to that set are unique. A fault-tolerant metric basis is a resolving set with a minimum cardinality that continues to resolve the graph even after the removal of any one of its vertices. The fault-tolerant metric dimension is the cardinality of such a fault-tolerant metric basis. In this article, we investigate the fault-tolerant metric dimension of graphs formed through the point-attaching process of primary subgraphs. This process involves connecting smaller subgraphs to specific vertices of a base graph, resulting in a more complex structure. By analyzing the distance properties and connectivity patterns, we establish explicit formulae for the fault-tolerant resolving sets of these composite graphs. Furthermore, we extend our results to specific graph products, such as rooted products. For these products, we determine the fault-tolerant metric dimension in terms of the fault-tolerant metric dimension of the primary subgraphs. Our findings demonstrate how the fault-tolerant dimension is influenced by the structural characteristics of the primary subgraphs and the attaching vertices. These results have potential applications in network design, error correction, and distributed systems, where robustness against vertex failures is crucial.

Title:
Matchings in Matroids over Abelian Groups, III
Mohsen Aliabadi, Elliot Krop
Comments:
Comments are welcome!
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
In an abelian group $G$, a \emph{matching} is a bijection $f\colon A\to B$ between finite subsets $A,B\subseteq G$ such that $a+f(a)\notin A$ for all $a\in A$. We say that $G$ has the \emph{matching property} if every pair of finite subsets $A,B\subseteq G$ with $|A|=|B|$ and $0\notin B$ admits such a matching. This paper develops matroidal analogues of classical results on group matchings. By embedding matroid ground sets in $G$, we introduce base matchings between matroid bases, recovering the group-theoretic setting in the uniform case, and derive structural and combinatorial criteria for their existence. Our methods blend techniques from matroid theory, group theory, and additive number theory. Our main focus is on paving matroids, a class conjectured to constitute asymptotically almost all matroids. We prove symmetric self-matchability for all paving matroids, extend asymmetric results via the hyperplane-nullity parameter, and connect stressed hyperplanes to matchability through relaxation, bridging paving and uniform matroids. This paper continues a line of research initiated in [3,4], yet is written to be self-contained and may be read independently.

Title:
Distribution of statistics on separable permutations restricted by a flat POP
Alice L.L. Gao, Sergey Kitaev, Ya-Xing Li, Xuan Ruan
Comments:
To appear in Discrete Applied Mathematics
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
Finding distributions of statistics in pattern-avoiding permutations has attracted significant attention in the literature. In particular, Chen, Kitaev, and Zhang derived functional equations for the joint distributions of any subset of classical minima and maxima statistics, as well as for the joint distributions of ascents and descents in separable permutations. Meanwhile, partially ordered patterns (POPs) have also been extensively studied. Notably, so-called flat POPs played a key role, via the notion of shape-Wilf-equivalence, in proving a conjecture on pattern-avoiding permutations.
In this paper, we study flat POP-avoiding separable permutations, where the maximum element in a flat POP receives the largest label. Avoiding such a POP imposes restrictions on the position of the maximum element in a separable permutation, forcing it to be positioned to the left. We establish a system of functional equations describing the joint distribution of six classical statistics in the most general case, extending the work of Chen, Kitaev, and Zhang.
As a specialization, when the POP has length 3, we recover a joint distribution result of Han and Kitaev on permutations avoiding classical patterns of length 3. As another specialization, for the flat POP of length 4, we derive an explicit rational generating function that captures the distribution of six statistics, with a numerator containing 100 monomials and a denominator containing 19 monomials.

Linear non-divergence elliptic equations in a bounded, infinitely winding planar domain
Luan Hoang, Akif Ibragimov
Comments:
submitted for publication, 27 pages, 2 figures
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
We study the second order elliptic equations of non-divergence form in a planar domain with complicated geometry. In this case the domain winds around a fixed circle infinitely many times and converges to it when the rotating angle goes to infinity. For the homogeneous equation and the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition, in the case of bounded drifts, we prove that the maximum of the solution on the cross-section corresponding to a given rotating angle either grows or decays exponentially as the angle goes to infinity. Results for the oscillation and its asymptotic estimates are also obtained for inhomogeneous Dirichlet data. If the drift is unbounded but does not grow to infinity too fast, then the above maximum also goes to either zero or infinity. For the inhomogeneous equation, we obtain the estimates in the case of bounded forcing functions. Moreover, we establish the uniqueness of the solution and its continuous dependence on the boundary data and the forcing function.

Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
We characterize the sets of solvability for Hermite bivariate interpolation problems when the sum of multiplicities is at most $2n + 2$, with $n$ the degree of the polynomial space. This result extends an earlier theorem (2000) by one of the authors concerning the case $2n+1$. The latter theorem, in turn, can be regarded as a natural generalization of a classical theorem of Severi (1921).

Multiplicative Hitchin fibrations and Langlands duality
Guillermo Gallego

We identify pairs of (twisted) multiplicative Hitchin fibrations which are "dual" in the sense that their bases are identified and their generic fibres are dual Beilinson $1$-motives. More precisely, we match the following: (1) an untwisted multiplicative Hitchin fibration associated with a simply-laced semisimple group $G$ with an untwisted multiplicative Hitchin fibration associated with the Langlands dual group $G^\vee$; (2) a twisted multiplicative Hitchin fibration associated with a simply-laced and simply-connected semisimple group $G$, without factors of type $\mathsf{A}_{2\ell}$, and a diagram automorphism $\theta \in \mathrm{Aut}(G)$ with an untwisted multiplicative Hitchin fibration associated with the Langlands dual group $H^\vee$ of the invariant group $H=G^\theta$; (3) two twisted multiplicative Hitchin fibrations associated with $G=\mathrm{SL}_{2\ell +1}$ and two special automophisms of order $2$ and $4$, respectively. These results are consistent with a conjecture of Elliott and Pestun (arXiv:1812.05516).

Triple product $L$-functions and the Ramanujan conjecture
Jayce R. Getz, Heekyoung Hahn, HaoYun Yao
Comments:
welcome!
Subjects:
Number Theory (math.NT); Representation Theory (math.RT)
We prove that the Ramanujan conjecture is true under the assumption that the expected analytic properties of triple product $L$-functions hold. Further, we explain how these analytic properties imply certain reduction steps in the construction of functorial transfers in the sense of Langlands. Roughly, at the level of stably automorphic representations, they allow one to reduce any functorial transfer from a given reductive group $G$ to a general linear group to a finite family of transfers depending on $G.$

Title:
On Laplacian and Signless Laplacian Permanental Polynomials of Some Well-known Graphs
Sarbari Mitra, Soumya Bhoumik
Comments:
23 pages
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
The permanent of an $n \times n$ matrix $M = (m_{ij})$ is defined as $\mathrm{per}(M) = \sum_{\sigma \in S_n} \prod_{i=1}^n m_{i,\sigma(i)}$, where $S_n$ denotes the symmetric group on $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$. The permanental polynomial of $M$, is defined by $\psi(M;x) = \mathrm{per}(xI_n - M)$. We study two fundamental variants: the Laplacian permanental polynomial $\psi(L(G);x)$ and signless Laplacian permanental polynomial $\psi(Q(G);x)$ of a graph $G$. A graph is said to be {determined} by its (signless) Laplacian permanental polynomial if no other non-isomorphic graph shares the same polynomial. A graph is combinedly determined when isomorphism is guaranteed by the equality of both polynomials. Characterizing which graphs are determined by their(signless) Laplacian permanental polynomials is an interesting problem. This paper investigates the permanental characterization problem for several families of starlike graphs, including: spider graphs (tree), coconut tree, perfect binary tree, corona product of $C_m$ and $K_n$, and $\bar K_n$ for various values of $m$ and $n$. We establish which of these graphs are determined by their Laplacian or signless Laplacian permanental polynomials, and which require both polynomials for complete characterization. We emphasize that in this manuscript, we have considered a few techniques to compute the permanental polynomial of matrices and their propagation.

Ideally Connected Cographs and Chordal Graphs
Richter Jordaan
Comments:
16 pages, 4 figures. Comments are welcome!
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
For distinct vertices $u,v$ in a graph $G$, let $\kappa_G(u,v)$ denote the maximum number of internally disjoint $u$-$v$ paths in $G$. Then, $\kappa_G(u,v) \leq \min\{ \mbox{deg}_G(u), \mbox{deg}_G(v) \}$. If equality is attained for every pair of vertices in $G$, then $G$ is called ideally connected. In this paper, we characterize the ideally connected graphs in two well-known graph classes: the cographs and the chordal graphs. We show that the ideally connected cographs are precisely the $2K_2$-free cographs, and the ideally connected chordal graphs are precisely the threshold graphs, the graphs that can be constructed from the single-vertex graph by repeatedly adding either an isolated vertex or a dominating vertex.

Projective Plane Subdivision Method For Initial Orbit Determination
Ruiqi Huang, Anton Leykin, Michela Mancini
Comments:
17 pages, 9 figures
Subjects:
Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
Initial Orbit Determination (IOD) is the classical problem of estimating the orbit of a body in space without any presumed information about the orbit. The geometric formulation of the ''angles-only'' IOD in three-dimensional space: find a conic curve with a given focal point meeting the given lines of sight (LOS). We provide an algebraic reformulation of this problem and confirm that five is the minimal number of lines necessary to have a finite number of solutions in a non-special case, and the number of complex solutions is 66. We construct a subdivision method to search for the normal direction to the orbital plane as a point on the real projective plane. The resulting algorithm is fast as it discovers only a handful of the solutions that are real and physically meaningful.

Title:
Is a Dissipative System Always a Gradient System or a Gradient Like System?
Rafael Rangel
Subjects:
Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
We find that to the dynamics of a given dissipative system a $p=1$ differential form can be associated with a general decomposition into a potential term and a non-potential residual part. If the residual part is absent the form is closed and the system is gradient system or gradient like. If it is non-closed, in the differential form approach, it remains non-closed under a variable change of coordinates, i.e., the system is not a gradient one or a gradient like in any coordinate system. On the other hand, there are claims that a potential should always exists, i.e., the class of dissipative systems and the the class of gradient systems should coincide. We fix this conundrum by introducing a generalized change of coordinates that aims a transformation to a gradient system or a gradient like system. The condition of being closed in the new coordinates of a certain, through the generalized change of coordinates defined differential form, results in a nonlinear differential equation together with a consistency condition. We give examples of physical systems where an analytical solution for the transformation can be found, and hitherto, the potential, but even when the potential is not accessible analytically, we find that it always exist, and therefore we give in principle an affirmative answer to the defining question of this work. Our findings removes loopholes in the question if a potential may exist but it is not known.

Nonmonotone Trust-Region Methods for Optimization of Set-Valued Mapping of Finite Cardinality
Suprova Ghosh, Debdas Ghosh, Zai-Yun Peng, Xian-Jun Lon
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
Non-monotone trust-region methods are known to provide additional benefits for scalar and multi-objective optimization, such as enhancing the probability of convergence and improving the speed of convergence. For optimization of set-valued maps, non-monotone trust-region methods have not yet been explored and investigated to see if they show similar benefits. Thus, in this article, we propose two non-monotone trust-region schemes--max-type and average-type for set-valued optimization. Using these methods, the aim is to find \emph{K}-critical points for a non-convex unconstrained set optimization problem through vectorization and oriented-distance scalarization. The main modification in the existing trust region method for set optimization occurs in reduction ratios, where max-type uses the maximum over function values from the last few iterations, and avg-type uses an exponentially weighted moving average of successive previous function values till the current iteration. Under appropriate assumptions, we show the global convergence of the proposed methods. To verify their effectiveness, we numerically compare their performance with the existing trust region method, steepest descent method, and conjugate gradient method using performance profile in terms of three metrics: number of non-convergence, number of iterations, and computation time.

A Scalable Formula for the Moments of a Family of Self-Normalized Statistics
Haolin Zou, Heyuan Yao, Victor de la Peña
Subjects:
Statistics Theory (math.ST); Computation (stat.CO)
Following the student t-statistic, normalization has been a widely used method in statistic and other disciplines including economics, ecology and machine learning. We focus on statistics taking the form of a ratio over (some power of) the sample mean, the probabilistic features of which remain unknown. We develop a unified formula for the moments of these self-normalized statistics with non-negative observations, yielding closed-form expressions for several important cases. Moreover, the complexity of our formula doesn't scale with the sample size $n$. Our theoretical findings, supported by extensive numerical experiments, reveal novel insights into their bias and variance, and we propose a debiasing method illustrated with applications such as the odds ratio, Gini coefficient and squared coefficient of variation.

Given an elliptic fibration $\pi : M \to S^2$ with singular locus $\Delta \subseteq S^2$, let $\operatorname{Br}(\pi) < \operatorname{Mod}(S^2,\Delta)$ be the subgroup of the spherical braid group consisting of those braids that lift to a fiber-preserving diffeomorphism of $M$. We classify the order $n = |\Delta|$ elements of $\operatorname{Br}(\pi)$ up to conjugacy in $\operatorname{Br}(\pi)$. To do so, we relate these conjugacy classes to special points on the $\operatorname{SL}_2$-character variety for $(S^2,\Delta)$ that correspond naturally to the exceptional elliptic curves $\mathbb{C}/\mathbb{Z}[\omega]$ and $\mathbb{C}/\mathbb{Z}[i]$ with their associated norms on $\mathbb{Z}[\omega]$ and $\mathbb{Z}[i]$. We also show that there are no elements of order $n-1$ or $n-2$ in $\operatorname{Br}(\pi)$, as there are in $\operatorname{Mod}(S^2,\Delta)$.

Should We Relax Stability in Matching Markets?
Dimitris Bertsimas, Carol Gao
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
Centralized assignment markets have historically relied on Deferred-Acceptance (DA) algorithms, which do not incorporate multiple objectives into the assignment. In this work, we propose an optimization-based many-to-one assignment algorithm that explores the trade-offs between minimizing the number of blocking pairs in the match and other important objectives. In order to scale to high-dimensional problems, we develop an algorithm using inverse optimization to obtain the optimal cost vector that implicitly optimizes for stability. This is empirically tested on two application areas for which the DA algorithm is widely used: school assignment and medical residency match. Computational tests on a simulated Boston Public Schools (BPS) match show that this method effectively reduces transportation cost and increases number of students receiving an offer in the first round of match at the expense of a small percentage of blocking pairs. Similar improvement in the number of couples matched to the same location is observed in a synthetic residency match.

Two types of corona products for simple directed graphs are introduced, extending the classical notions from the undirected setting: the vertex-corona and the arc-corona. Their structural and spectral properties are investigated through the use of digraph coronals, with particular emphasis on the adjacency, Laplacian, and signless Laplacian spectra. Finally, the coronals corresponding to these three matrices are computed for several families of digraphs.

Error analysis of a fully discrete structure-preserving finite element scheme for a diffuse-interface model of tumour growth
Agus L. Soenjaya, Ping Lin, Thanh Tran
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
We develop a fully discrete structure-preserving finite element method for a diffuse-interface model of tumour growth. The system couples a Cahn--Hilliard type equation with a nonlinear reaction-diffusion equation for nutrient concentration and admits a dissipative energy law at the continuous level. For the discretisation, we employ a scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) formulation together with a mixed finite element method for the Cahn--Hilliard part and standard conforming finite elements for the reaction-diffusion equation in space, combined with a first-order Euler time-stepping scheme. The resulting method is linear, unconditionally energy-stable, mass-preserving, and inherits a discrete energy dissipation law associated with the SAV-based approximate energy functional, while requiring the solution of only linear systems at each time step. Under suitable regularity assumptions on the exact solution, we derive rigorous error estimates in $L^2$, $H^1$, and $L^\infty$ norms, establishing first-order accuracy in time and optimal-order accuracy in space. A key step in this analysis is the proof of boundedness of the numerical solutions in $L^\infty$. Numerical experiments validate the theoretical convergence rates and demonstrate the robustness of the method in capturing characteristic phenomena such as aggregation and chemotactic tumour growth.

Strong solutions for a class of stochastic thermo-magneto-hydrodynamic-type systems with multiplicative noise
Agus L. Soenjaya, Thanh Tran
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Probability (math.PR)
We study the existence and uniqueness of strong solutions, in the sense of PDEs and probability, for a broad class of nonlinear stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) on a bounded domain $\mathscr{O}\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ ($d\leq 3$), perturbed by spatially correlated multiplicative noise. Our framework applies to many physically relevant systems, including stochastic convective Brinkman--Forchheimer equations, stochastic magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), stochastic Bénard convection in porous media, stochastic convective dynamo models, and stochastic magneto-micropolar fluids, among others. The analysis relies on Galerkin approximations and compactness arguments. Up to a suitable stopping time, we derive strong moment bounds and verify a Cauchy property for the approximate solutions, in the absence of any inherent cancellation structure. By applying a Gronwall-type lemma for stochastic processes, we establish the existence and uniqueness of maximal strong pathwise solutions, which are global in two spatial dimensions. These results provide a unified treatment of a wide class of nonlinear stochastic thermo-magneto-fluid models in the literature.

To the best of our knowledge, since the extended horizontal linear complementarity problem (EHLCP) was first introduced and studied by Kaneko in 1977, no iterative methods or error analysis have been developed for it due to the interdependence of its multiple unknowns in a 'chain-like' structure. This paper aims to address these gaps by:
(1) proposing an equivalent fixed-point formulation of the EHLCP by using a variable transformation technique with the max-min function;
(2) developing efficient iterative methods for solving the EHLCP based on this fixed-point form, along with their convergence analysis;
(3) deriving global error bounds and computable estimates for the EHLCP.
Several numerical examples from applications such as multicommodity market equilibrium and bilateral obstacle problems are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods and bounds.

A Time-Inconsistent Stochastic Optimal Control Problem in an Infinite Time Horizon
Qingmeng Wei, Jiongmin Yong
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
This paper is concerned with a time-inconsistent stochastic optimal control problem in an infinite time horizon with a non-degenerate diffusion in the state equation. A major assumption is that people become rational after a large time. Under such a condition, the problem in an infinite time horizon can be decomposed into two parts: a non-autonomous time-consistent problem in an infinite time horizon and a time-inconsistent problem in a finite time horizon. Then an equilibrium strategy will be constructed. Both Bolza type problem and recursive cost problem are considered.

The whys and hows of conditioning of DG plane wave Trefftz methods: a single element

Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
Plane-wave Trefftz methods (PWB) for the Helmholtz equation offer significant advantages over standard discretization approaches whose implementation employs more general polynomial basis functions. A disadvantage of these methods is the poor conditioning of the system matrices. In the present paper, we carefully examine the conditioning of the plane-wave discontinuous Galerkin method with reference to a single element. The properties of the mass and stiffness matrices depend on the size and geometry of the element. We study the mass and system matrices arising from a PWB on a single disk-shaped element. We then examine some preconditioning strategies, and present results showing their behaviour with three different criteria: conditioning, the behaviour of GMRES residuals, and impact on the $L^2$-error.

This paper investigates the number of monic integer polynomials of degree $n$ whose roots are all real and positive. We establish an asymptotic formula for the case of fixed trace by estimating the number of integer sequences satisfying Maclaurin's inequalities. For cubic polynomials, we derive a much more precise asymptotic result. Furthermore, we analyse the arithmetic properties of the discriminants of these polynomials, showing that a positive proportion of cubics have square-free discriminants.

Sequential test sampling for stochastic derivative-free optimization
Anjie Ding, Francesco Rinaldi, Luis Nunes Vicente
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
In many derivative-free optimization algorithms, a sufficient decrease condition decides whether to accept a trial step in each iteration. This condition typically requires that the potential objective function value decrease of the trial step, i.e., the true reduction in the objective function value that would be achieved by moving from the current point to the trial point, be larger than a multiple of the squared stepsize. When the objective function is stochastic, evaluating such a condition accurately can require a large estimation cost. In this paper, we frame the evaluation of the sufficient decrease condition in a stochastic setting as a hypothesis test problem and solve it through a sequential hypothesis test. The two hypotheses considered in the problem correspond to accepting or rejecting the trial step. This test sequentially collects noisy sample observations of the potential decrease until their sum crosses either a lower or an upper boundary depending on the noise variance and the stepsize. When the noise of observations is Gaussian, we derive a novel sample size result, showing that the effort to evaluate the condition explicitly depends on the potential decrease, and that the sequential test terminates early whenever the sufficient decrease condition is away from satisfaction. Furthermore, when the potential decrease is~$\Theta(\delta^r)$ for some~$r\in(0,2]$, the expected sample size decreases from~$\Theta(\delta^{-4})$ to~$O(\delta^{-2-r})$. We apply this sequential test sampling framework to probabilistic-descent direct search. To analyze its convergence rate, we extend a renewal-reward supermartingale-based convergence rate analysis framework to an arbitrary probability threshold. By doing so, we are able to show that probabilistic-descent direct search has an iteration complexity of $O(n/\epsilon^2)$ for gradient norm...

Approximations of the strict order property
Scott Mutchnik
Comments:

Subjects:
Logic (math.LO); Combinatorics (math.CO)
We observe that the definition of Shelah's classical $\mathrm{NSOP}_{n}$ hierarchy for first-order theories, for integers $n \geq 3$, can be restated so that it extends to the case where $n$ is replaced with any real number $r \geq 3$. Using this observation, we define a potentially larger family of properties $\mathrm{NSOP}_{r}$ for real numbers $r \geq 3$. Motivated by the question of whether the integer-valued and real-valued hierarchies are distinct, we translate these hierarchies into the setting of hereditary classes, obtaining a new real-valued quantity of independent combinatorial interest, $\mathfrak{o}(\mathcal{H})$, associated with any hereditary class $\mathcal{H}$. We show that, when $\mathcal{H}$ is defined by a finite family of forbidden weakly embedded substructures, $\mathfrak{o}(\mathcal{H})$ is an integer.
While Malliaris implicitly showed that the properties $\mathrm{NSOP}_{n}$ are equivalent to closure under helix maps between graphs, both our observation that the properties $\mathrm{NSOP}_{n}$ can be restated so that $n$ can be replaced with any real number at least $3$, and our result that $\mathfrak{o}(\mathcal{H})$ is an integer when $\mathcal{H}$ is a hereditary class defined by a finite family of forbidden weakly embedded substructures, are even exhibited by a special class of helix maps, the interval helix maps. These are helix maps that respect the direction of edges, and whose regions are disjoint unions of linearly ordered sets without any edges between them. Toward showing the conjectural claim that $\mathfrak{o}(\mathcal{H})$ is not an integer in general, and therefore that the real-valued $\mathrm{NSOP}_{r}$ hierarchy is distinct from the integer-valued $\mathrm{NSOP}_{n}$ hierarchy at the level of hereditary classes, we show that the statement that $\mathfrak{o}(\mathcal{H})$ is an integer in general cannot be exhibited by interval helix maps.

Existence, asymptotic behaviors, and high-dimensional uniqueness of topological solutions to the skew-symmetric Chern-Simons system on lattice graphs

Write $$g=4\pi\sum_{j=1}^{k_1}m_j\delta_{p_j},\ h=4\pi\sum_{j=1}^{k_2}n_j\delta_{q_j},\ B = 4\pi\sum_{j=1}^{k_1}m_j + 4\pi\sum_{j=1}^{k_2}n_j.$$ For any fixed $g,h$, we prove the existence of the topological solutions to the systems, then obtain the asymptotic behaviors of topological solutions as $\lambda \rightarrow 0_+$ and $\lambda \rightarrow +\infty$, and finally prove the uniqueness of the topological solutions when the dimension of lattice graph $\mathbb{Z}^n$ is large enough or $\lambda$ is large enough.

Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
This article focuses two issues related to the first-order discounted mean field games system. The first is the time discretization problem. The time discretization approach enables us to prove the existence of solutions (u,m) of the system, where u is a viscosity solution of the discounted Hamilton-Jacobi equation and m is a projected minimizing measure satisfying the continuity equation in the sense of distributions. The second is the vanishing discount problems for both the discounted mean field games system and its discretized system. The methods we use primarily derive from weak KAM theory. Moreover, we provide an example demonstrating the non-uniqueness of solutions to the discounted mean field games system.

Monoidal categorification and quantum affine algebras III

Subjects:
Representation Theory (math.RT); Quantum Algebra (math.QA)
Let $U_q'(\mathfrak{g})$ be an arbitrary quantum affine algebra of either untwisted or twisted type, and let $\mathscr{C}_{\mathfrak{g}}^0$ be its Hernandez-Leclerc category. We denote by $\mathsf{B}$ the braid group determined by the simply-laced finite type Lie algebra $ \mathsf{g}$ associated with $U_q'(\mathfrak{g})$. For any complete duality datum $\mathbb{D}$ and any sequence of simple roots of $\mathsf{g}$, we construct the corresponding affine cuspidal modules and affine determinantial modules and study their key properties including T-systems. Then, for any element $b$ of the positive braid monoid $\mathsf{B}^+$, we introduce a distinguished subcategory $\mathscr{C}_{\mathfrak{g}}^{\mathbb{D}}(b)$ of $\mathscr{C}_{\mathfrak{g}}^0$ categorifying the specialization of the bosonic extension $\widehat{\mathcal{A}}(b)$ at $q^{1/2}=1$ and investigate its properties including the categorical PBW structure. We finally prove that the subcategory $\mathscr{C}_{\mathfrak{g}}^{\mathbb{D}}(b)$ provides a monoidal categorification of the (quantum) cluster algebra $\widehat{\mathcal{A}}(b)$, which significantly generalizes the earlier monoidal categorification developed by the authors.

Data-Driven Contextual Optimization with Gaussian Mixtures: Flow-Based Generalization, Robust Models, and Multistage Extensions
YoungChul Yoon, Grani A. Hanasusanto, Yijie Wang
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
Contextual optimization enhances decision quality by leveraging side information to improve predictions of uncertain parameters. However, existing approaches face significant challenges when dealing with multimodal or mixtures of distributions. The inherent complexity of such structures often precludes an explicit functional relationship between the contextual information and the uncertain parameters, limiting the direct applicability of parametric models. Conversely, while non-parametric models offer greater representational flexibility, they are plagued by the "curse of dimensionality," leading to unsatisfactory performance in high-dimensional problems. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel contextual optimization framework based on Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs). This model naturally bridges the gap between parametric and non-parametric approaches, inheriting the favorable sample complexity of parametric models while retaining the expressiveness of non-parametric schemes. By employing normalizing flows, we further relax the GM assumption and extend our framework to arbitrary distributions. Finally, inspired by the structural properties of GMMs, we design a novel GMM-based solution scheme for multistage stochastic optimization problems with Markovian uncertainty. This method exhibits significantly better sample complexity compared to traditional approaches, offering a powerful methodology for solving long-horizon, high-dimensional multistage problems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework through extensive numerical experiments on a series of operations management problems. The results show that our proposed approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, underscoring its practical value for complex decision-making problems under uncertainty.

Resource Allocation for Mutualistic Symbiotic Radio with Hybrid Active-Passive Communications
Hong Guo, Yinghui Ye, Haijian Sun, Liqin Shi, Rose Qingyang Hu
Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT)
Mutualistic SR is a communication paradigm that offers high spectrum efficiency and low power consumption, where the SU transmits information by modulating and backscattering the PT's signal, enabling shared use of spectrum and power with PT. In return, the PT's performance can be enhanced by SU's backscattered signal, forming a mutualistic relationship. However, the low modulation rate causes extremely inferior transmission rates for SUs. To improve the SU transmission rate, this paper proposes a new mutualistic SR with HAPC to explore the tradeoff between BC and AC in terms of power consumption and transmission rate, enabling each SU to transmit signal via passive BC and AC alternatively. We propose two problems to maximize the total rate of all SUs under the fixed and dynamic SIC ordering, respectively. The fixed SIC ordering-based problem is to jointly optimize the SUs' reflection coefficients, the transmit power of each SU during AC, and the time allocation for each SU during BC and AC, subject to the energy causality constraint and the PT's transmission rate gain constraint. In addition to pondering the constraints involved in the fixed SIC ordering-based problem, the dynamic SIC ordering-based problem, which is a mixed integer programming one, further considers the SIC ordering constraint. The above two problems are solved by our proposed SCA-based and BCD-based iterative algorithms, respectively. Simulation results demonstrate that: 1) the proposed mutualistic SR system outperforms traditional designs in terms of the rates achieved by SUs under the same constraints; 2) the total rate of all SUs under the dynamic SIC ordering is larger than that of the fixed one when the PT's minimum rate gain is high, and becomes nearly identical when the PT's minimum rate gain is low.

In this paper, for the generalized Fibonacci sequence $\left\{W_n\left(a,b,p,q\right)\right\}$, by using elementary methods and techniques, we give the asymptotic estimation values of $\left(\sum\limits_{k=n}^{\infty}\frac{1}{\sum\limits_{i=0}^{t}s_{i}W_{mk+l_i}}\right)^{-1}$ and $\left(\sum\limits_{k=n}^{\infty}\frac{\left(-1\right)^k}{\sum\limits_{i=0}^{t}s_{i}W_{mk+l_i}}\right)^{-1}$, respectively. In particular, for some special $a,b,p,q,m,t,s_i$ and $l_i\left(0\leq i\leq t \right)$, Theorem \ref{theorem 3.1} is just Theorems 2.1, 2.5-2.6 in \cite{A22} given by Yuan et al.

This paper presents a novel method for solving Fokker-Planck equations by learning neural samplers via a weak adversarial framework. We represent the solution distribution through a neural pushforward map, bypassing the limitations of density-based methods. A key innovation is our use of computationally efficient plane-wave test functions, whose derivatives are explicitly computed -- a treatment distinct from prior work. This approach handles distributions without densities and naturally enforces probability conservation.

A Weighted Sampling Method for Inverse Medium Problem with Limited Aperture
Fuqun Han, Kazufumi Ito
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
Inverse medium scattering problems arise in many applications, but in practice, the measurement data are often restricted to a limited aperture by physical or experimental constraints. Classical sampling methods, such as MUSIC and the linear sampling method, are well understood for full-aperture data, yet their performance deteriorates severely under limited-aperture conditions, especially in the presence of noise. We propose a new sampling method tailored to the inverse medium problem with limited-aperture data. The method is motivated by the linear sampling framework and incorporates a weight function into the index function. The weight is designed so that the modified kernel reproduces the full-aperture behavior using only limited data, which both localizes oscillations and improves the conditioning of the far-field system, thereby yielding more accurate and stable reconstructions. We provide a theoretical justification of the method under the Born approximation and an efficient algorithm for computing the weight. Numerical experiments in two and three dimensions demonstrate that the proposed method achieves greater accuracy and robustness than existing sampling-type methods, particularly for noisy, limited-aperture data.

Joint Scheduling and Multiflow Maximization in Wireless Networks
Yanxiao Liu, Shenghao Yang, Cheuk Ting Li
Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT)
Towards the development of 6G mobile networks, it is promising to integrate a large number of devices from multi-dimensional platforms, and it is crucial to have a solid understanding of the theoretical limits of large-scale networks. We revisit a fundamental problem at the heart of network communication theory: the maximum multiflow (MMF) problem in multi-hop networks, with network coding performed at intermediate nodes. To derive the exact-optimal solution to the MMF problem (as opposed to approximations), conventional methods usually involve two steps: first calculate the scheduling rate region, and then find the maximum multiflow that can be supported by the achievable link rates. However, the NP-hardness of the scheduling part makes solving the MMF problem in large networks computationally prohibitive. In this paper, while still focusing on the exact-optimal solution, we provide efficient algorithms that can jointly calculate the scheduling rate region and solve the MMF problem, thereby outputting optimal values without requiring the entire scheduling rate region. We theoretically prove that our algorithms always output optimal solutions in a finite number of iterations, and we use various simulation results to demonstrate our advantages over conventional approaches. Our framework is applicable to the most general scenario in multi-source multi-sink networks: the multiple multicast problem with network coding. Moreover, by employing a graphical framework, we show that our algorithm can be extended to scenarios where propagation delays are large (e.g., underwater networks), in which recent studies have shown that the scheduling rate region can be significantly improved by utilizing such delays.

We show that dynamical degrees of affine-triangular automorphisms in dimension 4 are algebraic integers of degree not larger than 4. As a consequence, if char(k) is not equal to 2, then dynamical degrees of quadratic automorphisms in dimension 4 are algebraic integers of degree not larger than 4. We also explore some results in higher dimensions. These results partially give the affirmative answer to the Conjecture in DF21

We study 2-colorings of Z/pZ that avoid monochromatic 4-term arithmetic progressions for every step d with p not dividing d. We completely classify all primes 5 <= p <= 997: such a coloring exists if and only if p is in {5, 7, 11}. For larger primes, nonexistence is consistent with lower bounds of Wolf and Lu--Peng on the number of monochromatic 4-APs in 2-colorings of Z_p. When solutions exist, the minimal period equals p, and we enumerate them up to dihedral symmetries and a global color swap. The proofs combine residue-class checks with small structural observations and SAT certificates for nonexistence (DRAT-verified). All scripts and proof logs are provided for exact reproduction.

Efficient Importance Sampling for Wrong Exit Probabilities over Combinatorially Many Rare Regions
Yanglei Song, Georgios Fellouris
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR); Computation (stat.CO)
We consider importance sampling for estimating the probability that a light-tailed $d$-dimensional random walk exits through one of many disjoint rare-event regions before reaching an anticipated target. This problem arises in sequential multiple hypothesis testing, where the number of such regions may grow combinatorially and in some cases exponentially with the dimension. While mixtures over all associated exponential tilts are asymptotically efficient, they become computationally infeasible even for moderate values of $d$. We develop a method for constructing asymptotically efficient mixtures with substantially fewer components by combining optimal tilts for a small number of regions with additional proposals that control variance across a large collection of regions. The approach is applied to the estimation of three probabilities that arise in sequential multiple testing, including a multidimensional extension of Siegmund's classical exit problem, and is supported by both theoretical analysis and numerical experiments.

Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
We analyze decay of Chebyshev coefficients and local Chebyshev approximations for functions of finite regularity on finite intervals, focusing on the framework where the interval length tends to zero while the number of approximation nodes remains fixed. For all four families of Chebyshev polynomials, we derive error estimates that quantify the dependence on the interval length for (i) the decay of Chebyshev coefficients, (ii) the approximation error between continuous and discrete Chebyshev coefficients, and (iii) the convergence of Chebyshev-based quadrature rules. These results fill a gap in the existing theory and provide a unified and rigorous description of how approximation accuracy scales on shrinking intervals, offering new theoretical insight and practical guidance for high-order numerical methods on decomposed domains. Numerical experiments corroborate the theoretical results, confirming the decay rates and illustrating the error behavior in practice.

The countable condensation on linear orders
Jennifer Brown, Ricardo Suárez
Subjects:
Logic (math.LO)
The countable condensation on a linear order $L$ is the equivalence relation $\sim_\omega$ defined by declaring $x \sim_\omega y$ when the set of points between $x$ and $y$ is countable. We characterize the linear orders $L$ that condense to $1$ under the countable condensation by constructing a linear order $U$ that is universal for the order types $L$ such that $L/\!\!\sim_\omega\, \cong 1$. We define a multiplication operation $\cdot_\omega$ on the class of linear orders by setting $M \cdot_\omega L$ to be the order type of $(ML)/\!\!\sim_\omega$ (where $ML$ denotes the lexicographic product), and show that the right identities for $\cdot_\omega$ are exactly the uncountable suborders of $U$. The order types of these uncountable suborders of $U$ form a left regular band under $\cdot_\omega$, and the order types of all suborders of $U$ form a semigroup.

Unlike the Hochschild chain complex of an algebra, the Hochschild cochain complex of an algebra is not functorial. Nonetheless, we show that the Hochschild cochain complex of an algebra even a dg category is of lax functoriality, i.e., there exists a lax functor from bicategory of dg categories to bicategory of $B_\infty$-algebras which sends every dg category to its Hochschild cochain complex. This result is a homotopy version of the lax functoriality of center of an algebra obtained by Davydov, Kong, Runkel, Grady, Oren, et al, in the more general context of dg categories, and extends the restricted functoriality of Hochschild cochain complex of a dg category obtained by Keller to global lax functoriality.

Extracting Interpretable Higher-Order Topological Features across Multiple Scales for Alzheimer's Disease Classification
Dengyi Zhao, Shanyong Li, Yunping Wang, Chenfei Wang, Zhiheng Zhou, Guiying Yan, Xingqin Qi
Subjects:
Geometric Topology (math.GT)
Brain network topology, derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), holds promise for improving Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis. Current methods primarily focus on lower-order topological features, often overlooking the significance of higher-order features such as connected components, cycles, and cavities. These higher-order features are critical for understanding normal brain function and have been increasingly linked to the pathological mechanisms of AD. However, their quantification for diagnosing AD is hindered by their inherent nonlinearity and stochasticity in the brain. This paper introduces a novel framework for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease that uses persistent homology to extract higher-order topological features from fMRI data. It also introduces four quantitative methods that capture subtle, multiscale geometric variations in functional brain networks associated with AD. Our experimental results demonstrate that this framework significantly outperforms existing methods in AD classification. Extensive ablation studies and interpretability analysis confirm the effectiveness of our framework. Our study also reveals that the number of cycles or cavities significantly decrease in AD patients. The extracted key brain regions derived from cycles and cavities align with domain knowledge in neuroscience literature and provide direct and insightful findings. This study highlights the potential of higher-order topological features for early AD detection and significantly advances the field of brain topology analysis in neurodegenerative disease research.

(1) $I(D)$ is componentwise linear; (2) $I(D)$ is vertex splittable; (3) $I(D)$ has linear quotient property; (4) both $G$ and $H(I(D)_{(2)})$ are co-chordal and $D_1,D_2,D_3,D_4$ as in Figure 3, are not induced subgraphs of $D$. Furthermore, if $D$ is a complete $r$-partite weighted oriented graph, then we show that: $I(D)^k$ is componentwise linear, for some $k\geq 2 \iff I(D)$ is componentwise linear.

We prove the monotonicity property of the Robin torsion function in a smooth planar domain $\Omega$ with a line of symmetry, provided that the Robin coefficient $\beta$ is greater than or equal to the negative of the boundary curvature $\kappa$ (i.e., $\beta \geq -\kappa$ on $\partial\Omega$). We also show that this condition is, in a certain sense, sharp by constructing a counterexample.

Comments:

Subjects:
Functional Analysis (math.FA); Complex Variables (math.CV)
This paper investigates composition and weighted composition operators acting between Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS). We employ the properties of their reproducing kernel structure to provide a characterization of the boundedness of these operators, which naturally subsumes many results on boundedness of composition operators in the literature. Emphasis is put on Hardy and Bergman spaces on the unit ball $\mathbb{B}_n$ and unit polydisc $\mathbb{D}^n$. Further, we provide an alternative proof for the boundedness of composition operators on the Hardy space of the unit disc, based on reproducing kernel techniques which is different from traditional analytic and operator-theoretic methods.

Simple linesearch-free first-order methods for nonconvex optimization
Shotaro Yagishita, Masaru Ito
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
This paper presents an auto-conditioned proximal gradient method for nonconvex optimization. The method determines the stepsize using an estimation of local curvature and does not require any prior knowledge of problem parameters and any linesearch procedures. Its convergence analysis is carried out in a simple manner without assuming the convexity, unlike previous studies. We also provide convergence analysis in the presence of the Kurdyka--Łojasiewicz property, adaptivity to the weak smoothness, and the extension to the Bregman proximal gradient method. Furthermore, the auto-conditioned stepsize strategy is also applied to the conditional gradient (Frank--Wolfe) method and the Riemannian gradient method.

We propose a sum rule for derangements. Three different proofs are provided. The first one involves integral representations and the second one relies on the Hermite identity for the integer part of the product of an integer by a real number. The third one, which, unlike the previous ones, is not based on induction, proceeds directly from a recurrence relation for the number of derangements.

Normalized solution for Kirchhoff equation with upper critical exponent and mixed Choquard type nonlinearities
Jinyuan Shang, Wenting Zhao, Xianjiu Huang

Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
In this paper, we consider the existence of normalized solution to the following Kirchhoff equation with mixed Choquard type nonlinearities: \begin{equation*} \begin{cases} -\left(a + b \int_{\mathbb{R}^3} |\nabla u|^2 \, dx\right) \Delta u - \lambda u = \mu |u|^{q-2} u + (I_\alpha * |u|^{\alpha + 3}) |u|^{\alpha +1} u, \quad x \in \mathbb{R}^3, \\ \int_{\mathbb{R}^3} u^2 \, dx = \rho^2, \end{cases} \end{equation*} where $a,b,\rho >0$, $\alpha \in \left(0, 3\right)$, $\frac{14}{3} < q < 6$ and $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$ will arise as a Lagrange multiplier. The quantity $\alpha + 3$ here represents the upper critical exponent relevant to the Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality, and this exponent can be regarded as equivalent to the Sobolev critical exponent $2^*$. We generalize the results by Wang et al.(Discrete and Continuous Dynamical Systems, 2025), which focused on nonlinear Kirchhoff equations with combined nonlinearities when $2< q< \frac{10}{3}$. The primary challenge lies in the necessity for subtle energy estimates under the \(L^2\)-constraint to achieve compactness recovery. Meanwhile, we need to deal with the difficulties created by the two nonlocal terms appearing in the equation.

Functorial equivalence classes of $2$-blocks of tame representation type

Comments:

Subjects:
Representation Theory (math.RT)
For any block of a finite group over an algebraically closed field of characteristic $2$ which has dihedral, semidihedral, or generalized quaternion defect groups, we determine explicitly the decomposition of the associated diagonal $p$-permutation functor over an algebraically closed field $\mathbb{F}$ of characteristic $0$ into a direct sum of simple functors. As a consequence we see that two blocks with dihedral, semidihedral, or generalized quaternion defect groups are functorially equivalent over $\mathbb{F}$ if and only if their fusion systems are isomorphic. It is an open question if two blocks (with arbitrary defect groups) that are functorially equivalent over $\mathbb{F}$ must have isomorphic fusion systems. The converse is wrong in general.

Structure of non-solvable cyclic metric Lie algebras
An Huihui, Tan Ju, Yan Zaili
Subjects:
Differential Geometry (math.DG); Rings and Algebras (math.RA)
This paper presents a systematic study of the structure of non-solvable cyclic metric Lie algebras. A cyclic metric is a symmetric bilinear form satisfying a cyclic cocycle condition, which arises naturally in the contexts of non-associative algebras and homogeneous pseudo-Riemannian manifolds. Firstly, we drive some sufficient conditions for a cyclic metric Lie algebra to be an orthogonal direct product of its semisimple and solvable parts. Then we introduce the notion of cyclic quadruples to analyze the interaction between semisimple and radical components. Finally, we use the double extension method to provide a complete characterization of non-degenerate cyclic metric Lie algebras that are neither semisimple nor solvable, over the fields of complex and real numbers.

Ortho-isomorphisms of von Neumann algebras
Minghui Ma, Weijuan Shi
Subjects:
Operator Algebras (math.OA)
Suppose $\mathscr M$ and $\mathscr N$ are von Neumann algebras. Two operators $A$ and $B$ in $\mathscr M$ are said to be orthogonal if $A^*B=0$, meaning their ranges are orthogonal. Let $\varphi\colon\mathscr M\to\mathscr N$ be a map. We say that $\varphi$ is an ortho-isomorphism if it is bijective and satisfies that $A^*B=0$ if and only if $\varphi(A)^*\varphi(B)=0$ for all $A,B\in\mathscr M$. The map $\varphi$ is called ortho-additive if the additive relation $\varphi(A+B)=\varphi(A)+\varphi(B)$ holds for all $A,B\in \mathscr M$ with $A^*B=0$. In this paper, we characterize the complete structure of ortho-additive ortho-isomorphisms between von Neumann algebras, which is an analogue of Dye's theorem and Uhlhorn's theorem.

Distances between pure quantum states induced by a distance matrix
Tomasz Miller, Rafał Bistroń
Comments:

Subjects:
Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
With the help of a given distance matrix of size $n$, we construct an infinite family of distances $d_p$ (where $p \geq 2$) on the the complex projective space $\mathbb{P}(\mathbb{C}^n)$, modelling the space of pure states of an $n$-dimensional quantum system. The construction can be seen as providing a natural way to isometrically embed any given finite metric space into the space of pure quantum states 'spanned' upon it. In order to show that the maps $d_p$ are indeed distance functions -- in particular, that they satisfy the triangle inequality -- we employ methods of analysis, multilinear algebra and convex geometry, obtaining a non-trivial convexity result in the process. The paper significantly extends earlier work, resolving an important question about the geometry of quantum state space imposed by the quantum Wasserstein distances and solidifying the foundation for applications of distances $d_p$ in quantum information science.

Subjects:

The multiple spacecraft guidance problem for proximity flight in libration point orbit is considered. A nonlinear optimal control problem with continuous-time path constraints enforcing minimum separation between each spacecraft is formulated. The path constraints are enforced via an isoperimetric reformulation, and the problem is solved via a sequential convex programming. The proposed approach does not necessitate specific dynamic system structures to provide continuous-time guarantees for minimum separation within a fuel-optimal solution. The optimal control problem is deployed within a model predictive control scheme and demonstrated in the ephemeris model dynamics.

Limit theory for mean-field control problems with common noise adapted controls
Bruno Bouchard, Xiaolu Tan
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC); Probability (math.PR)
We consider a mean-field control problem in which admissible controls are required to be adapted to the common noise filtration. The main objective is to show how the mean-field control problem can be approximates by time consistent centralized finite population problems in which the central planner has full information on all agents' states and gives an identical signal to all agents. We also aim at establishing the optimal convergence rate. In a first general path-dependent setting, we only prove convergence by using weak convergence techniques of probability measures on the canonical space. Next, when only the drift coefficient is controlled, we obtain a backward SDE characterization of the value process, based on which a convergence rate is established in terms of the Wasserstein distance between the original measure and the empirical one induced by the particles. It requires Lipschitz continuity conditions in the Wasserstein sense. The convergence rate is optimal. In a Markovian setting and under convexity conditions on the running reward function, we next prove uniqueness of the optimal control and provide regularity results on the value function, and then deduce the optimal weak convergence rate in terms of the number of particles. Finally, we apply these results to the study of a classical optimal control problem with partial observation, leading to an original approximation method by particle systems.

Unconditional and optimal error analysis of two linearized finite difference schemes for the logarithmic Schrödinger equation
Tingchun Wang, Jingye Yan
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
In this paper, we propose two linearized finite difference schemes for solving the logarithmic Schrödinger equation (LogSE) without the need for regularization of the logarithmic term. These two schemes employ the first-order and the second-order backward difference formula, respectively, for temporal discretization of the LogSE, while using the second-order central finite difference method for spatial discretization. We overcome the singularity posed by the logarithmic nonlinearity $f(u)=u\ln|u|$ in establishing optimal $l^{2}$-error estimates for the first-order scheme, and an almost optimal $l^{2}$-error estimate for the second-order scheme. Compared to the error estimates of the LogSE in the literature, our error bounds not only greatly improve the convergence rate but also get rid of the time step restriction. Furthermore, without enhancing the regularity of the exact solution or imposing any requirements on the grid ratio, we establish error estimates of the two proposed schemes in the discrete $H^{1}$ norm. However, the existing results available in the literature either fail to provide $H^{1}$ error estimates or require certain restrictions on the grid ratio. Numerical results are reported to confirm our error estimates and demonstrate rich dynamics of the LogSE.

We prove a sharp lower bound for the fundamental gap of convex domains in Gaussian space, the difference between the first two eigenvalues of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operator with Dirichlet boundary conditions. Our main result establishes that the gap is bounded below by the gap of a corresponding one-dimensional Schrödinger operator, confirming the Gaussian analogue of the fundamental gap conjecture. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the normalized gap of the one dimensional model is monotonically increasing with the diameter and prove the sharpness of our estimate. This work extends the seminal results of Andrews and Clutterbuck for Euclidean domains and Seto, Wang and Wei for spherical domains to the fundamentally important setting of Gaussian spaces.

Algorithms for Modular Parametrizations of Elliptic Curves over $\mathbb{Q}$
SanMin Wang
Subjects:
Number Theory (math.NT)
Let \( E \) be a complex elliptic curve with conductor \( N \) and modular invariant \( j(E) \in \mathbb{Q} \). We construct a class of modular polynomials $F_N(x,j)$ that relate the modular function $x$ on $X_0(N)$ to the $j$-invariant $j$, where $x$ is obtained by composing the first coordinate function of $E$ with the modular parametrization $\varphi: X_0(N) \rightarrow E$. Using $F_N(x,j)$, we can precisely determine the poles of $\varphi$, compute exact values of $\varphi$ at cusps, and develop an algorithm for calculating ramification points of $\varphi$. Moreover, $F_N(x,j)$ yields an efficient algorithm for computing the fibres of $\varphi$ over arbitrary points on $E$. In some sense, $F_N(x,j)$ also provides a ``total" formula for computing the minimal polynomial of the images of Heegner points on $X_0(N)$ under $\varphi$. Especially, we compute the semi-trace of the image $\varphi ([\frac{{ - 1 + \sqrt { - 3} }}{2}])$ of the CM-point $[\frac{-1 + \sqrt{-3}}{2}]$ on $X_{0}(389)$, under the action of a 65-element subgroup of the 260-element Galois group of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3}, j(389 \cdot \frac{-1 + \sqrt{-3}}{2}))$. Finally, we associate a point of infinite order in~\( E(\mathbb{Q}) \) with an infinite sequence~$\{ (j(\tau_n), j(N\tau_n)) \}_{n \in \mathbb{Z}^+} $ of algebraic numbers whose degrees are bounded by the degree of~$\varphi$. This provides one seemingly practicable approach to addressing the BSD conjecture.

In this article, we are interested in studying the Cauchy problems for nonlinear damped wave equations and their systems on a weighted graph. Our main purpose is two-fold, namely, under certain conditions for volume growth of a ball and the initial data we would like to not only prove nonexistence of global (in time) weak solutions but also indicate lifespan estimates for local (in time) weak solutions when a blow-up phenomenon in finite time occurs. Throughout the present paper, we will partially give a positive answer for the optimality of our results by an application to the $n$-dimensional integer lattice graph $\Z^n$ to recover the well-known results in the Euclidean setting.

The Bayesian SIAC filter

Comments:
20 pages
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
We propose the Bayesian smoothness-increasing accuracy-conserving (SIAC) filter -- a hierarchical Bayesian extension of the existing deterministic SIAC filter. The SIAC filter is a powerful numerical tool for removing high-frequency noise from data or numerical solutions without degrading accuracy. However, current SIAC methodology is limited to (i) nodal data (direct, typically noisy function values) and (ii) deterministic point estimates that do not account for uncertainty propagation from input data to the SIAC reconstruction. The proposed Bayesian SIAC filter overcomes these limitations by (i) supporting general (non-nodal) data models and (ii) enabling rigorous uncertainty quantification (UQ), thereby broadening the applicability of SIAC filtering. We also develop structure-exploiting algorithms for efficient maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, with a focus on linear data models with additive Gaussian noise. Computational experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the Bayesian SIAC filter across several applications, including signal denoising, image deblurring, and post-processing of numerical solutions to hyperbolic conservation laws. The results show that the Bayesian approach produces point estimates with accuracy comparable to, and in some cases exceeding, that of the deterministic SIAC filter. In addition, it extends naturally to general data models and provides built-in UQ.

We introduce the notion of a $c$-category, which is a kind of category whose behaviour is controlled by connective ring spectra. More precisely, any $c$-category admits a finite step resolution by categories of compact modules over connective ring spectra. We introduce nilpotent extensions of $c$-categories, and show that they induce isomorphisms on truncating invariants, such as the fiber of the cyclotomic trace map. We show that for many stacks, the category of perfect complexes is naturally a $c$-category and deduce a generalization of the Dundas--Goodwillie--McCarthy theorem to such stacks.

Lower Bounds for the Shadiness Constant of Finite-Dimensional Normed Spaces

Comments:

Subjects:
Functional Analysis (math.FA); Optimization and Control (math.OC)
By the Hahn-Banach theorem, every normed space admits rank-one projections with operator norm one. However, this is not true for higher rank projections. Bosznay and Garay showed that for every $d \geq 3$ there exist $d$-dimensional normed spaces $X$ for which all projections of rank $k$, with $2 \leq k \leq d-1$, have norm larger than or equal to some constant $c>1$. We call the maximal such constant the shadiness constant of $X$. Although constructing such spaces is not difficult, few explicit estimates of their shadiness constants exist. We show how optimization techniques can provide provable lower bounds for these shadiness constants. As an application, we construct a $3$-dimensional normed space whose unit ball is a polytope with $12$ vertices, with shadiness constant at least $1.01$. Furthermore we show that there is no shady norm on $\mathbb{R}^3$ whose unit ball is a polytope with $10$ or fewer vertices, thereby confirming a conjecture by Bosznay and Garay.

Integrals for Bialgebras

Subjects:

A well-known result by Larson and Sweedler shows that integrals on a Hopf algebra can be obtained by applying the Structure Theorem for Hopf modules to the rational part of its linear dual. This fact can be rephrased by saying that taking the space of integrals comes from a right adjoint functor from a category of modules to the category of vector spaces. This observation inspired the categorical approach that we advocate in this work, which yields to a new notion of integrals for bialgebras in the linear setting. Despite the novelty of the construction, it returns the classical definition in the presence of an antipode. We test this new concept on bialgebras that satisfy at least one of the following properties: being coseparable as regular module coalgebras, having a one-sided antipode, being commutative, being cocommutative, or being finite-dimensional. One of the main results we obtain in this process is a dual Maschke-type theorem relating coseparability and total integrals. Remarkably, there are cases in which the space of integrals turns out to be isomorphic to that of the associated Hopf envelope. In particular, this space results to be one-dimensional for finite-dimensional bialgebras, providing an existence and uniqueness theorem for integrals in the finite-dimensional case. Furthermore, explicit computations are given for concrete examples including the polynomial bialgebra with one group-like variable, the quantum plane and the coordinate bialgebra of $n$-by-$n$ matrices.

We investigate an invariant, called the Serre depth, from the perspective of combinatorial commutative algebra.

In particular, we relate the Serre depth both to the minimal free resolution of a Stanley--Reisner ring and to that of its Alexander dual. Also, we establish an analogue of a known result that describes the depth of Stanley--Reisner rings in terms of skeletons. Moreover, we study the Serre depth for $(S_{2})$ and the depth on the symbolic powers of Stanley--Reisner ideals. It had been an open question whether the depth of the symbolic powers of Stanley--Reisner ideals satisfies a non-increasing property, but Nguyen and Trung provided a negative answer. We construct an example that the Serre depth for $(S_{2})$ and the depth do not satisfy this property and its second symbolic power is Cohen--Macaulay. Moreover, we prove that the sequence of the Serre depth for $(S_{2})$ on the symbolic powers is convergent and that its limit coincides with the minimum value. Finally, we study the Serre depth on edge and cover ideals. Whether the depth on symbolic powers of edge ideals satisfies a non-increasing property has remained an open question. We address a related problem and show that the Serre depth for $(S_{2})$ on edge ideals of any well-covered graph satisfies a non-increasing property. In addition, we prove that the Serre depth for $(S_{2})$ on the cover ideals of any graph also satisfies a non-increasing property. Moreover, we determine the Serre depth on edge ideals of very well-covered graphs.

Boundedness of solutions of the first-order linear multidimensional difference equations

Dynamical Systems (math.DS)
We investigate the boundedness of solutions of the first order linear difference equation of the form $x_{n+1} = Ax_{n} + y_{n}, \; n \geq 1$ where $A$ is a square matrix with complex entries, sequence $\{y_{n}\}_{n\geq 1}$ and initial value $x_1$ are supposed to be known. Firstly, we discuss the one-dimensional case of this equation $x_{n+1} = ax_{n} + y_{n}, \; n \geq 1$ where $a$ is a complex number. In particular, we obtain the sufficient conditions for boundedness or unboundedness of the solutions in case $|a|=1$(the critical case) by considering the exponential sums of the forms $\sum y_{n}e(n\varphi)$ and $\sum e(f(n))$.
Then we proceed to the investigation of the equation in the multidimensional case and reduce our problem to analysis of the spectrum and Jordan cells of matrix $A$. The problem is especially interesting when spectrum of $A$ contains eigenvalues $\lambda$ with $|\lambda|=1$. At the end of the article we obtain a theorem that reveals the connection between equations $x_{n+1} = ax_{n} + y_{n}, \; n \geq 1$ with $|a|=1$ and $x_{n+1} = Jx_{n} + y_{n}, \; n \geq 1$ with $J$ being a Jordan cell of an eigenvalue $\lambda$, $|\lambda|=1$.

On the Multiary Algebraic Formulation of an Idempotent Symmetric Limit Convex Structure
Walter Briec
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
In [14], B-convexity was defined as an appropriate Painlevé-Kuratowski limit of linear convexities. More recently, an alternative algebraic formulation over the entire Euclidean vector space was proposed in [9] and [10]. The issue with the definition presented in [14] is that it was not developed from an algebraic perspective, but rather as the upper limit of a sequence of generalized convex polytopes whose form was not explicitly given. In this paper, we build on recent work and provide an algebraic formulation for these limiting polytopes. Consequently, we deduce a multiary algebraic form of B-convexity that involves an idempotent, non-associative algebraic structure, extending the formalism proposed in [9] to an arbitrary number of points. Among other things, we demonstrate that these limiting polytopes do not satisfy the idempotent symmetrical convex structure defined in [9]. In the context of this formalism, we derive a general separation result in Rn by approximating convex sets by polytopes. We conclude by clarifying some points regarding the external representation of polytopes proposed in [11] and analyze the structure of the polytopes that arise in this context.

Well-posedness of the Boltzmann and Landau Equations in Critical Spaces

Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
This paper investigates the well-posedness of the inhomogeneous Boltzmann and Landau equations in critical function spaces, a fundamental open problem in kinetic theory. We develop a new analytical framework to establish local well-posedness near a global Maxwellian for both equations, under the assumption that the initial perturbation is small in a critical norm. A major contribution lies in the introduction of a novel anisotropic norm adapted to the intrinsic scaling invariance of the equations, which provides precise control over the high-frequency behavior of solutions. By leveraging the regularizing effect and a decomposition of the linearized collision operator, we further extend the local solution globally in time and establish pointwise decay estimates. Our work not only resolves a fundamental issue in the theory of kinetic equations in critical spaces, but also provides a new approach applicable to a broader class of kinetic models.

A class of flexible and efficient partitioned Runge-Kutta-Chebyshev methods for some time-dependent partial differential equations
Xiao Tang, Junwei Huang
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
Many time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) can be transformed into an ordinary differential equations (ODEs) containing moderately stiff and non-stiff terms after spatial semi-discretization. In the present paper, we construct a new class of second-order partitioned explicit stabilized methods for the above ODEs. We treat the moderately stiff term with an s-stage Runge-Kutta-Chebyshev (RKC) method and treat the non-stiff term with a 4m-stage explicit Runge-Kutta (RK) method. Different from several existing partitioned explicit stabilized methods that employ fixed-stage RK methods to handle the non-stiff term, both the parameters $s$ and $m$ in our methods can be flexibly adjusted as needed for the problems. This feature endows our methods with superior flexibility and applicability compared to several existing partitioned explicit stabilized methods, as demonstrated in several specific numerical examples (including the advection-diffusion equations, the Burgers equations, the Brusselator equations and the damped wave equations).

Beam Squint Assisted Joint Angle-Distance Localization for Near-Field Communications
Aibiao Zhang, Weizheng Zhang, Chiya Zhang
Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT)
With the advent of extremely large-scale MIMO (XL-MIMO), mmWave/THz bands and ultra-wideband transmission, future 6G systems demand real-time positioning with centimeter or even millimeter level accuracy. This paper addresses the pronounced near-field beam squint problem caused by phase shifter based beamforming in wideband near-field scenarios and proposes a beam squint assisted joint angle-distance localization scheme. The key idea is to employ true-time-delay (TTD) units together with phase shifters (PS) to synthesize a controllable joint angle-distance (JAD) trajectory that establishes a unique mapping between subcarriers and spatial locations, enabling single scan acquisition of target angle and range. To implement this paradigm efficiently, we design a coarse to fine two stage estimator: a low complexity coarse stage based on subcarrier power peaks for user separation and candidate region selection, followed by a local high resolution refinement stage that applies spatial smoothing and near-field multiple signal classification (MUSIC) over multiple subcarriers and fuses the resulting spectra by geometric averaging to suppress spurious peaks. We theoretically prove the correctness and uniqueness of the MUSIC spatial spectrum peak under the proposed near-field steering model, and derive the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for joint angle-distance estimation. Simulation results in single and multi-user scenarios validate that the proposed method achieves very high accuracy and robustness, significantly outperforming conventional two-step approaches, and is promising for practical 6G sensing and localization deployments.

We investigate practical finite-blocklength classical-quantum channel coding over the quantum amplitude damping channel (ADC), aiming to transmit classical information reliably through quantum outputs. Our findings indicate that for any finite blocklength, a naive (uncoded) approach fails to offer any advantage over the ADC. Instead, sophisticated encoding strategies that leverage both classical error-correcting codes and quantum input states are crucial for realizing quantum performance gains at finite blocklengths.

Graph-Aware Learning Rates for Decentralized Optimization
Aaron Fainman, Stefan Vlaski
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC); Signal Processing (eess.SP)
We propose an adaptive step-size rule for decentralized optimization. Choosing a step-size that balances convergence and stability is challenging. This is amplified in the decentralized setting as agents observe only local (possibly stochastic) gradients and global information (like smoothness) is unavailable. We derive a step-size rule from first principles. The resulting formulation reduces to the well-known Polyak's rule in the single-agent setting, and is suitable for use with stochastic gradients. The method is parameter free, apart from requiring the optimal objective value, which is readily available in many applications. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the performance is comparable to the optimally fine-tuned step-size.

We consider the two-dimensional defocusing nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLS) on the unit disc in the plane with the Gibbs initial data under radial symmetry. By using a type of random averaging operator ansatz, we build a strong local-in-time solution theory, and thus prove almost sure global well-posedness and invariance of the Gibbs measure via Bourgain's invariant measure argument. This work completes the program initiated by Tzvetkov (2006, 2008) on the construction of invariant Gibbs dynamics (of strong solutions) for NLS on the disc.

Subjects:

In this paper we present a cell centered Galerkin (CCG) method applied to miscible displacement problems in heterogeneous porous media. The CCG approach combines concepts from finite volume and discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods to arrive at an efficient lowest-order approximation (one unknown per cell). We demonstrate that the CCG method can be defined using classical DG weak formulations, only requires one unknown per cell, and is able to deliver comparable accuracy and improved efficiency over traditional higher-order interior penalty DG methods. In addition, we prove that the CCG method for a model Poisson problem gives rise to a inverse-positive matrix in 1D. A plethora of computational experiments in 2D and 3D showcase the effectiveness of the CCG method for highly heterogeneous flow and transport problems in porous media. Comparisons between CCG and classical DG methods are included.

A monotonicity formula for the fractional Laplacian and instability results for the Shrira equation

Comments:

Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
By employing a new class of pseudo-differential operators introduced in a previous work, we establish a novel monotonicity formula for the fractional Laplacian $|\nabla_x|^\alpha$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$, with $n \geq 2$ and $\alpha \in [1,2)$, This framework enables us to localize our analysis to specific regions of Euclidean space where monotonicity properties of the $L^2$-mass of solutions to dispersive equations with fractional dispersion are preserved.
As an application, we focus on the Shrira equation, proving conditional instability results for its traveling wave solutions in the critical regime. We deduce key virial-type estimates that govern the long-time behavior of the $L^2$-mass. As a consequence, we establish instability results without requiring pointwise decay estimates employed in previous works. Our approach provides a robust and flexible method for monotonicity techniques to higher dimensions, shedding light on the delicate interplay between nonlocal dispersion and spatial localization in nonlinear dispersive models.

Maximal curves of genus 5 over finite fields

Subjects:
Number Theory (math.NT); Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)
A maximal curve over a finite field $\mathbb F_q$ is a curve whose number of points reaches the upper Hasse-Weil-Serre bound. We define the discriminant of $\mathbb F_q$ as $d(\mathbb F_q):= \lfloor2\sqrt{q}\rfloor^2-4q$, which arises as the discriminant of the characteristic polynomial of the Frobenius for a maximal elliptic curve defined over $\mathbb F_q$. In this article we investigate the existence of a maximal curve of genus $5$ defined over a finite field $\mathbb F_q$ of discriminant $-19$. Using the knowledge on the automorphism group of such a curve, we prove that such curve does not exist when $q\equiv 2,3,4 \mod 5$. In the case $q\equiv 1\mod 5$ we give models of the potential maximal curve. Finally, for the case $q\equiv 0\bmod 5$, we prove that such a curve might exist only for $q=5^7$.

Ramsey model of optimal growth with Allee effect

Comments:

Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
For the Ramsey model of economic growth, which describes the optimal allocation of consumption and saving over time, we assume the population dynamics to follow the Allee effect. The so-called Allee threshold separates two regimes from each other. If starting below the threshold, the population decreases to zero. Above this threshold, it gradually saturates. We show that the corresponding consumption per capita stabilizes at two different levels accordingly. As for our main result, the consumption per capita performs in the long run better if the population becomes extinct, rather then it advances the saturation level. This is in line with our previous results on the capital per capita for the underlying Solow-Swan model of economic growth with the Allee effect. However, the comparison of consumption-to-capital ratios at the both steady states crucially depends on the curvature of the production function.

It's well-known that maximum distance separable codes (in short, MDS) and linear complementary dual (in short, LCD) codes are very important in coding theory and practice. In 2023, Yue et al. [25] constructed three classes of LCD MDS codes via (*)-TGRS codes. Recently, Wu et al. [27] generalized the results given by Yue et al. and constructed several classes of LCD MDS codes. In this paper, we unify their constructions by defining the (*)-(L,P)-twisted generalized Reed-Solomon (in short, (*)-(L,P)-TGRS) code, give the parity-check matrix of (*)-(L,P)-TGRS codes, and then construct four classes of LCD codes. Finally, some corresponding examples are given.

Deadbeat Robust Model Predictive Control for Linear Parameter-Varying Systems
Georg Schildbach, Hossam S. Abbas
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
The concept of Deadbeat Robust Model Predictive Control (DRMPC) is to completely extinguish the effect of external disturbances within the first few steps of the prediction horizon. The benefit is that the remaining dynamics of the system can be planned with certainty. This means it is not necessary to employ a Robust Positive Invariant (RPI) set as a terminal condition, which is often complex or even intractable to compute. Recent work has shown that it is possible to obtain full system theoretic guarantees in the case of linear systems, including recursive feasibility of all constraints and input-to-state stability. This paper extends this contribution to linear time-varying (LTV) or parameter-varying systems (LPV) systems with bounded parametric uncertainty and additive disturbances. Full system-theoretic guarantees can also be provided for these cases. Numerical simulation results demonstrate that the performance of the proposed LPV-DRMPC scheme, with the origin as the terminal set and a slightly increased prediction horizon, is almost comparable to that of other LPV-MPC schemes with an RPI terminal set constraint, despite a lower computational complexity. Besides avoiding the computation of RPI terminal sets, LPV-DRMPC allows to shift a significant portion of the computations offline.

An Adaptive Sampling Algorithm for Level-set Approximation
Matteo Croci, Abdul-Lateef Haji-Ali, Ian C. J. Powell
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
We propose a new numerical scheme for approximating level-sets of Lipschitz multivariate functions which is robust to stochastic noise. The algorithm's main feature is an adaptive grid-based stochastic approximation strategy which automatically refines the approximation over regions close to the level set. This strategy combines a local function approximation method with a noise reduction scheme and produces $\varepsilon$-accurate approximations with an expected cost complexity reduction of $\varepsilon^{-\left(\frac{p+1}{\alpha p}\right)}$ compared to a non-adaptive scheme, where $\alpha$ is the convergence rate of the function approximation method and we assume that the noise can be controlled in $L^p$. We provide numerical experiments in support of our theoretical findings. These include 2- and 3-dimensional functions with a complex level set structure, as well as a failure region estimation problem described by a hyperelasticity partial differential equation with random field coefficients.

Movable-Antenna Trajectory Optimization for Wireless Sensing: CRB Scaling Laws over Time and Space
Wenyan Ma, Lipeng Zhu, Rui Zhang
Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT); Signal Processing (eess.SP)
In this paper, we present a new wireless sensing system utilizing a movable antenna (MA) that continuously moves and receives sensing signals to enhance sensing performance over the conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) sensing. We show that the angle estimation performance is fundamentally determined by the MA trajectory, and derive the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) of the mean square error (MSE) for angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation as a function of the trajectory for both one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) antenna movement. For the 1D case, a globally optimal trajectory that minimizes the CRB is derived in closed form. Notably, the resulting CRB decreases cubically with sensing time in the time-constrained regime, whereas it decreases linearly with sensing time and quadratically with the movement line segment's length in the space-constrained regime. For the 2D case, we aim to achieve the minimum of maximum (min-max) CRBs of estimation MSE for the two AoAs with respect to the horizontal and vertical axes. To this end, we design an efficient alternating optimization algorithm that iteratively updates the MA's horizontal or vertical coordinates with the other being fixed, yielding a locally optimal trajectory. Numerical results show that the proposed 1D/2D MA-based sensing schemes significantly reduce both the CRB and actual AoA estimation MSE compared to conventional FPA-based sensing with uniform linear/planar arrays (ULAs/UPAs) as well as various benchmark MA trajectories. Moreover, it is revealed that the steering vectors of our designed 1D/2D MA trajectories have low correlation in the angular domain, thereby effectively increasing the angular resolution for achieving higher AoA estimation accuracy.

Finite Volumes for a dissipative free boundary problem

Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
We study a toy model for the evolution of the oxygen concentration in an oxide layer. It consists in a transient convection diffusion equation in a one-dimensional domain of variable width. The motions of the boundaries are governed by the traces of the concentration. We exhibit a necessary and sufficient condition on the parameters involved in the model for the existence of a unique traveling-wave solution. Moreover, we show that the model admits some universal entropy structure, in the sense that any convex function of the concentration
yields a dissipated free energy (up to exchanges with the outer environment at the boundaries). We propose then an implicit in time arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian finite volume scheme based on Scharfetter-Gummel fluxes. It is shown to be unconditionally convergent, to preserve exactly the travelling wave, and to dissipate all the aforementioned free energies. Numerical experiments show that our scheme is first order accurate in time and second order in space, and that the transient solution converges in the long-time limit towards the traveling-wave solution.

Lagrangian controllability in perforated domains

Comments:

Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
The question at stake in Lagrangian controllability is whether one can move a patch of fluid particles to a target location by means of remote action in a given time interval. In the last two decades, positive results have been obtained both for the incompressible Euler and Navier-Stokes equations. However, for the latter, the case where the fluid is contained within domains bounded by solid boundaries with the no-slip condition has not been addressed, with respect to the difficulty caused by viscous boundary layers. In this paper, we investigate the Lagrangian controllability of viscous incompressible fluid in perforated domains for which the fraction of volume occupied by the holes is sufficiently small. Moreover, we quantitatively distinguish situations depending on the parameters for holes (diameter and distance) and for fluid (size of the initial data). Our approach relies on recent results on homogenization for evolutionary problems and on weak-strong stability estimates in measure of flows, alongside classical results on Runge-type approximations for elliptic equations and on Cauchy-Kowalevsky-type theorems for equations with analytic coefficients. Here, homogenization refers to the vanishing viscosity limit outside a porous medium, where (after scaling in time) the Navier-Stokes equations are homogenized to the Euler or Darcy equations.

Our analysis includes a necessary and sufficient condition for achieving the HMO, description of an algorithm for constructing optimal connectivity matrices, and strategies for pruning agents when heterogeneity obstructs mean optimization.

Bézout's theorem for abelian varieties

Subjects:
Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)
Let $X$, $Y$ be closed irreducible subvarieties of an absolutely simple abelian variety of dimension $g$ over a field. If $\dim(X) + \dim(Y) \le g$, we prove that the addition morphism $X \times Y \to X + Y$ is semismall. As a consequence, we deduce that if $\dim(X) + \dim(Y) \ge g$, the subvarieties $X$ and $Y$ must meet (Bézout's theorem). If we drop the assumption that the abelian variety is absolutely simple, we prove that Bézout's theorem still holds if $X$ satisfies a nondegeneracy condition. These results were previously known only in characteristic zero. Our proof of the semismallness statement is based on the theory of perverse sheaves: using results of Krämer and Weissauer, we prove that for perverse sheaves $K$ supported on $X$, and $L$ supported on $Y$, the convolution product $K * L$ is again perverse.

On 3-Connected Cubic Planar Graphs and their Strong Embeddings on Orientable Surfaces

Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO); Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM)
Although the strong embedding of a 3-connected planar graph $G$ on the sphere is unique, $G$ can have different inequivalent strong embeddings on a surface of positive genus. If $G$ is cubic, then the strong embeddings of $G$ on the projective plane, the torus and the Klein bottle each are in one-to-one correspondence with certain subgraphs of the dual graph $G^\ast$. Here, we exploit this characterisation and show that two strong embeddings of $G$ on the projective plane, the torus or the Klein bottle are isomorphic if and only if the corresponding subgraphs of $G^{\ast}$ are contained in the same orbit under $\mathrm{Aut}(G^{\ast})$. This allows us to construct a data base containing all isomorphism classes of strong embeddings on the projective plane, the torus and the Klein bottle of all 3-connected cubic planar graphs with up to 22 vertices. Moreover, we establish that cyclically 4-edge connected cubic planar graphs can be strongly embedded on orientable surfaces of positive genera. We use this to show that a 3-connected cubic planar graph has no strong embedding on orientable surfaces of positive genera if and only if it is the dual of an Apollonian network.

We revisit the effective Erdos-Wintner theorem for Zeckendorf expansions. Drmota and the author obtained a uniform Kolmogorov bound whose error involves $T\sum_{j>L-2h}|f(F_j)|$, which assumes absolute convergence of the linear tail $\sum_j f(F_j)$. We remove this assumption. Grouping the transfer matrices in pairs and working to second order on the logarithm of the product, after extracting the common linear phase along the dominant direction, yields a quadratic tail $T^2\sum_{j>L-2h} f(F_j)^2$, or, in a flexible variant, the split tail $T\sum_{|f(F_j)|>1/T}|f(F_j)| + T^2\sum_{|f(F_j)|\le 1/T} f(F_j)^2$. Either form requires only $\sum f(F_j)^2<\infty$.

We will use our new approach to this inequality in order to prove discrete analogues of this inequality and of an equivalent version of it, where we will consider the lattice point enumerator measure instead of the Lebesgue measure, and show that from such discrete analogues we can recover the aforementioned inequality and, therefore, Zhang's inequality.

This paper investigates the late-time instability of marching-on-in-time solution to the time-domain PMCHWT equation. The stability analysis identifies the static solenoidal nullspace of the time-domain electric field integral operator as the primary cause of instability. Furthermore, it reveals that the instability mechanisms of the time-domain PMCHWT equation are fundamentally different from those of the time-domain electric field integral equation. In particular, the PMCHWT's instability is much more sensitive to numerical quadrature errors, and its spectral characteristics are strongly influenced by the topology and smoothness of the scatterer surface.

On link quasimorphisms on the sphere and the equator conjecture
Baptiste Serraille, Ibrahim Trifa
Comments:
43 pages, 5 figures. Comments are welcome!
Subjects:
Symplectic Geometry (math.SG)
Link spectral invariants were introduced by Cristofaro-Gardiner, Humilière, Mak, Seyfaddini, and Smith. They induce Hofer-Lipschitz quasimorphisms on the group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of the two-dimensional sphere. We prove that some linear combinations of those quasimorphisms vanish on the stabiliser of the equator. As a consequence, at least one of the following statements holds: there are non-trivial linear relations between the link quasimorphisms, or the space of equators of the sphere has infinite Hofer diameter. The proof relies on an `almost' Künneth formula in Link Floer Homology for some specific type of connected sums.

Fourier heuristic PINNs to solve the biharmonic equations based on its coupled scheme

Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have been widely utilized for solving a range of partial differential equations (PDEs) in various scientific and engineering disciplines. This paper presents a Fourier heuristic-enhanced PINN (termed FCPINN) designed to address a specific class of biharmonic equations with Dirichlet and Navier boundary conditions. The method achieves this by decomposing the high-order equations into two Poisson equations. FCPINN integrates Fourier spectral theory with a reduced-order formulation for high-order PDEs, significantly improving approximation accuracy and reducing computational complexity. This approach is especially beneficial for problems with intricate boundary constraints and high-dimensional inputs. To assess the effectiveness and robustness of the FCPINN algorithm, we conducted several numerical experiments on both linear and nonlinear biharmonic problems across different Euclidean spaces. The results show that FCPINN provides an optimal trade-off between speed and accuracy for high-order PDEs, surpassing the performance of conventional PINN and deep mixed residual method (MIM) approaches, while also maintaining stability and robustness with varying numbers of hidden layer nodes.

Indoor Fluid Antenna Systems Enabled by Layout-Specific Modeling and Group Relative Policy Optimization

The fluid antenna system (FAS) revolutionizes wireless communications by employing position-flexible antennas that dynamically optimize channel conditions and mitigate multipath fading. This innovation is particularly valuable in indoor environments, where signal propagation is severely degraded due to structural obstructions and complex multipath reflections. In this paper, we study the channel modeling and joint optimization of antenna positioning, beamforming, and power allocation for indoor FAS. In particular, we propose, for the first time, a layout-specific channel model and a novel group relative policy optimization (GRPO) algorithm for indoor FAS. Compared to the state-of-the-art Sionna model, our approach achieves an $83.3\%$ reduction in computation time with an approximately $3$ dB increase in root-mean-square error (RMSE). When simplified to a two-ray model, our channel model enables a closed-form solution for the optimal antenna position, achieving near-optimal performance. {For the joint optimization problem, the proposed GRPO algorithm outperforms proximal policy optimization (PPO) and other baselines in sum-rate, while requiring only 49.2\% computational resources of PPO, due to its group-based advantage estimation.} Simulation results reveal that increasing either the group size or trajectory length in GRPO does not yield significant improvements in sum-rate, suggesting that these parameters can be selected conservatively without sacrificing performance.

Improved Constructions and Lower Bounds for Maximally Recoverable Grid Codes

Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT)
In this paper, we continue the study of Maximally Recoverable (MR) Grid Codes initiated by Gopalan et al. [SODA 2017]. More precisely, we study codes over an $m \times n$ grid topology with one parity check per row and column of the grid along with $h \ge 1$ global parity checks. Previous works have largely focused on the setting in which $m = n$, where explicit constructions require field size which is exponential in $n$. Motivated by practical applications, we consider the regime in which $m,h$ are constants and $n$ is growing. In this setting, we provide a number of new explicit constructions whose field size is polynomial in $n$. We further complement these results with new field size lower bounds.

On the Yau-Tian-Donaldson conjecture for weighted cscK metrics

Subjects:
Differential Geometry (math.DG); Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)
We establish a version, formulated in terms of non-Archimedean pluripotential theory, of the Yau-Tian-Donaldson conjecture for constant scalar curvature and, more generally, weighted extremal Kähler metrics with prescribed compact symmetry group on an arbitrary polarized projective manifold. This is accomplished by extending important previous work of Chi Li to the weighted case, and by establishing general slope formulas for the relevant weighted entropy and energy functionals. Among other things, our approach relies on key a priori estimates for cscK metrics due to Chen-Cheng (recently extended to the weighted case by Di Nezza-Jubert-Lahdili and Han-Liu), and on a crucial estimate for psh envelopes due to Berman-Demailly-Di Nezza-Trapani.

An Intrinsic $L_{\infty}$-Algebra on the Khovanov-Sano Complex

This paper reinterprets the symmetries of equivariant Khovanov homology, discovered by Khovanov and Sano, within the Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) formalism. We identify the Shumakovitch operator $\hat{\nu}$ as a BV Laplacian whose nilpotency, a consequence of the algebra's defining relations, induces an $L_{\infty}$-algebra on homology. We prove this structure is non-trivial through explicit computations of higher brackets. Furthermore, we construct a dual $L_{\infty}$-structure, suggesting a unifying homotopy $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ symmetry. The main result of this paper is to lift this structure from homology to the chain level. Applying the Homotopy Transfer Theorem, we construct an intrinsic $L_{\infty}$-algebra on the Khovanov-Sano complex, whose $\infty$-quasi-isomorphism class is a canonical link invariant. This provides a new algebraic framework in which we conjecture the origin of Steenrod operations in knot homology.

Integrated Sensing and Communication for Vehicular Networks: A Rate-Distortion Fundamental Limits of State Estimator

Comments:

Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT)
The state-dependent memoryless channel (SDMC) is employed to model the integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system for connected vehicular networks, where the transmitter conveys messages to the receiver while simultaneously estimating the state parameter of interest via the received echo signals. However, the performance of sensing has often been neglected in existing works. To address this gap, we establish the rate-distortion function for sensing performance in the SDMC model, which is defined based on standard information-theoretic principles to ensure clear operational meaning. In addition, we propose a modified Blahut-Arimoto type algorithm for solving the rate-distortion function and provide convergence proofs for the algorithm. We further define the capacity-rate-distortion tradeoff region, which, for the first time, unifies information-theoretic results for communication and sensing within a single optimization framework. Finally, we numerically evaluate the capacity-rate-distortion region and demonstrate the benefit of coding in terms of estimation rate for certain channels.

We study the trade-off between communication rate and privacy for distributed batch matrix multiplication of two independent sequences of matrices $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ with uniformly distributed entries. In our setting, $\mathbf{B}$ is publicly accessible by all the servers while $\mathbf{A}$ must remain private. A user is interested in evaluating the product $\mathbf{AB}$ with the responses from the $k$ fastest servers. For a given parameter $\alpha \in [0, 1]$, our privacy constraint must ensure that any set of $\ell$ colluding servers cannot learn more than a fraction $\alpha$ of $\mathbf{A}$. Additionally, we study the trade-off between the amount of local randomness needed at the encoder and privacy. Finally, we establish the optimal trade-offs when the matrices are square and identify a linear relationship between information leakage and communication rate.

We study how conditioning affects the long-term behavior of the Elephant Random Walk, focusing on its first return to the origin, namely, the time it takes to forget the training. When the walker is conditioned to be at position $n$ at time $n$, this return time scales as $n^{(4-4p)/(3-4p)}$ in the diffusive regime, and grows exponentially in the critical regime.

Subjects:

The notion of twist fields has played a fundamental role in many-body physics. It is used to construct the so-called disorder parameter for the study of phase transitions in the classical Ising model of statistical mechanics, it is involved in the Jordan-Wigner transformation in quantum chains and bosonisation in quantum field theory, and it is related to measures of entanglement in many-body quantum systems. I provide a pedagogical introduction to the notion of twist field and the concepts at its roots, and review some of its applications, focussing on 1+1 dimension. This includes: locality and extensivity, internal symmetries, semi-locality, the standard exponential form and height fields, path integral defects and Riemann surfaces, topological invariance, and twist families. Additional topics touched upon include renormalisation and form factors in relativistic quantum field theory, tau functions of integrable PDEs, thermodynamic and hydrodynamic principles, and branch-point twist fields for entanglement entropy. One-dimensional quantum systems such as chains (e.g. quantum Heisenberg model) and field theory (e.g. quantum sine-Gordon model) are the main focus, but I also explain how the notion applies to equilibrium statistical mechanics (e.g. classical Ising lattice model), and how some aspects can be adapted to one-dimensional classical dynamical systems (e.g. classical Toda chain).

We establish a connection between Cohen-Lyndon triples and equivariant homology theory, with a focus on the Baum-Connes conjecture. In the first part of this work, we establish an excision sequence for the classifying spaces for proper actions in equivariant homology theories. This provides a direct link between Cohen-Lyndon triples and the left-hand side of the Baum-Connes conjecture. Independently of these, we prove that the Baum-Connes conjecture with coefficients (BCC) with finite wreath products holds for all discrete hyperbolic groups, building on the monumental work of Lafforgue. Combining this with permanence properties and the work of Dahmani-Guirardel-Osin on relatively hyperbolic groups, we identify a broad class of groups, including all lattices in simple Lie groups of real rank one that satisfy the BCC with finite wreath products. This significantly broadens the scope of our first result, as Cohen-Lyndon triples arise naturally in the context of relatively hyperbolic groups, thereby connecting both sides of the Baum-Connes conjecture.

More specifically, we prove that simultaneously for every prime $p$, $\liminf_{n\rightarrow \infty} \frac{\log \vert \mathrm{Tor}_p(G_n^{\mathrm{ab}})\vert}{[G:G_n]} >0$ (where $\mathrm{Tor}_p(G_n^{\mathrm{ab}}) = \{g \in G_n^{\mathrm{ab}} \;\vert\; g \text{ has order a power of } p\}$).

On simultaneously preperiodic points for one-parameter families of polynomials in characteristic $p$

Subjects:

For a field $L$ of characteristic $p$, a polynomial $f \in \overline{\mathbb{F}}_p[x]$ and $\alpha, \beta \in L$, let $\mathrm{Prep}(f;\alpha,\beta)$ be the set of all $\lambda \in \overline{L}$ such that both $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are preperiodic under the action of $f_{\lambda}(x) := f(x) + \lambda$. Ghioca and Hsia proved that for certain families of polynomials, this set is infinite if and only if $f(\alpha)=f(\beta)$ or $\alpha, \beta \in \overline{\mathbb{F}}_p$. Building on their earlier work, we determine the condition that $\mathrm{Prep}(f;\alpha,\beta)$ is infinite for two classes of binomials that were left open. Specifically, let $f(x)=c_1 x^{d_1} + c_2 x^{d_2} \in \overline{\mathbb{F}}_p[x]$, where $c_i \in \overline{\mathbb{F}}_p^*$, $1 \le d_1 < d_2$ and $d_i=p^{\ell_i}s_i$ with $\ell_i \ge 0$ and $p \nmid s_i$. We prove that if $p \nmid s_1-1$ or $s_2=1$, then $\mathrm{Prep}(f;\alpha,\beta)$ is infinite if and only if $f(\alpha)=f(\beta)$ or $\alpha, \beta \in \overline{\mathbb{F}}_p$. The key idea of the proof is to use the parameters $\lambda_{\overline{\alpha}} := \overline{\alpha} - f(\overline{\alpha})$ associated to suitable elements $\overline{\alpha} \in \overline{L}$ satisfying $f(\overline{\alpha})=f(\alpha)$.

Lower bounds for the eigenvalues of the Hodge Laplacian on certain non-convex domains
Tirumala Chakradhar, Pierre Guerini
Subjects:
Differential Geometry (math.DG); Spectral Theory (math.SP)
We establish geometric lower bounds for the smallest positive eigenvalue of the Hodge Laplacian in the class of non-convex domains given by Euclidean annular regions with a convex outer boundary and a spherical inner boundary. These bounds are then extended to convex domains with multiple holes, where we derive lower bounds for certain higher order exact eigenvalues, and under additional geometric assumptions, also for the smallest positive eigenvalue. For $1$-forms on compact manifolds with boundary, we provide a general lower bound on the smallest exact eigenvalue - corresponding to the first positive Neumann eigenvalue - which, in certain respects, is better than the classical Cheeger inequality. Furthermore, we emphasise the necessity of the "contact radius" in the lower bounds of the main results. Our proofs employ local-to-global arguments via an explicit isomorphism between Cěch cohomology and de Rham cohomology to obtain Poincaré-type inequalities with explicit geometric dependence, and utilise certain generalised versions of the Cheeger-McGowan gluing lemma.

Subjects:

We initiate the study of definability (in the model-theoretic sense) of C*-tensor norms. We show that neither the minimal nor maximal tensor norms are definable uniformly over all C*-algebras. The proof in the case of the minimal tensor product norm uses a deep theorem of Kirchberg characterizing exactness in terms of tensor products with matrix ultraproducts while the case of maximal tensor products uses Pisier's recent characterization of the lifting property in terms of maximal tensor products and ultraproducts. We also study the question of when one of these tensor products can be definable in a particular C*-algebra. We establish some negative results along these lines for particular C*-algebras and when the definability condition is strengthened to be computable and of a restricted quantifier-complexity; these results use the quantum complexity results MIP$^*$=RE and MIP$^{co}=$coRE. As a byproduct of our arguments, we answer a question of Fritz, Netzer, and Thom by showing that the norm on $C^*(\mathbb{F}_n\times \mathbb{F}_n)$ is not computable for any $n\in \{2,3,\ldots,\infty\}$.

As consequences, we obtain corresponding results in the Sobolev and Orlicz-Sobolev classes defined in a certain domain of a Riemannian surface or factor space by the group of fractional-linear mappings of the unit ball.

We determine the extent to which continuous mappings in various Sobolev classes distort various dimensions, including the Hausdorff, the upper Minkowski (box-counting), and the upper intermediate dimensions. The intermediate and Minkowski dimension distortion results we obtain are novel already for various classes of fractionally smooth mappings between Euclidean spaces, extending the results of Hencl-Honzík (2015) and Huynh (2022) to these dimensions. In addition, our work also generalizes the aforementioned results, as well as results of Kaufman (2000) and Fraser-Tyson (2025), to certain weighted Euclidean spaces and, more generally, to doubling metric measure spaces. As an application of our main result, we quantify a dimension distortion property of quasisymmetric mappings proved by Bishop-Hakobyan-Williams (2016) for the intermediate dimension of non-Ahlfors regular subsets of the space.

We study an extended dynamical system on the non-negative real line with piecewise linear non-uniformly expanding local dynamics. With a uniformly distributed initial state, the distribution of the successive states coincides with that of a random walk in an inhomogeneous environment. Under suitable conditions on the environment, we establish a central limit theorem and a (non-Gaussian) local limit theorem for the walk. Our approach builds on the work of Leskelä and Stenlund (Stochastic Process.\ Appl.\ 121(12), 2011), who analyzed a corresponding model with uniformly expanding local dynamics.

We introduce and study a new inverse problem for antiplane shear in elastic bodies with strain-gradient interfaces. The setting is a homogeneous isotropic elastic body containing an inclusion separated by a thin interface endowed with higher-order surface energy. Using displacement-stress measurements on the exterior boundary, expressed through a certain Dirichlet-to-Neumann map, we show uniqueness in recovering both the shear and interface parameters, as well as the shape of the inclusion. To address the inverse shape problem, we adapt the factorization method to account for the complications introduced by the higher-order boundary operator and its nontrivial null space. Numerical experiments illustrate the feasibility of the approach, indicating that the framework potentially provides a practical tool for nondestructive detection of interior inhomogeneities, including damaged subvolumes.

We study the natural geometric elliptic operators on a class of complete Riemannian manifolds which include the 4-dimensional ALH* gravitational instantons and their higher dimensional Calabi-Yau analogues asymptotic to the model Calabi Ansatz metrics. Some of these were initially constructed by Tian and Yau, later by Hein and most recently by Y. Chen, and we call these Tian-Yau spaces. They have played an important role in the degeneration theory of K3 metrics, cf. Hein-Sun-Viaclosky-Zhang and Sun-Zhang, in the increasingly refined classification of gravitational instantons (cf. Collins-Jacob-Lin, Lee-Lin), and other areas. We show that these elliptic operators can be analyzed using the $\mathbf{a}$-pseudodifferential calculus of Grieser and Hunsicker, and use this to determine the space of $L^2$ harmonic forms in the four-dimensional setting, as well as the refined asymptotic regularity and local deformation theory of ALH* structures.

Version Age of Information with Contact Mobility in Gossip Networks

A gossip network is considered in which a source node updates its status while other nodes in the network aim at keeping track of it as it varies over time. Information gets disseminated by the source sending status updates to the nodes, and the nodes gossiping with each other. In addition, the nodes in the network are mobile, and can move to other nodes to get information, which we term contact mobility. The goal for the nodes is to remain as fresh as possible, i.e., to have the same information as the source's. To evaluate the freshness of information, we use the Version Age-of-Information (VAoI) metric, defined as the difference between the version of information available at a given node and that at the source. We analyze the effect of contact mobility on information dissemination in the gossip network using a Stochastic Hybrid System (SHS) framework for different topologies and mobility scalings with increasing number of nodes. It is shown that with the presence of contact mobility the freshness of the network improves in both ends of the network connectivity spectrum: disconnected and fully connected gossip networks. We mathematically analyze the average version age scalings and validate our theoretical results via simulations. Finally, we incorporate the cost of mobility for the network by formulating and solving an optimization problem that minimizes a weighted sum of version age and mobility cost. Our results show that contact mobility, with optimized mobility cost, improves the average version age in the network.

Title:
The Integral Chow Rings of the Moduli Stacks of Hyperelliptic Prym Pairs III

Subjects:
Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)
This paper is the third and final part of a series devoted to the description of the integral Chow rings of the moduli stacks of hyperelliptic Prym pairs. For a fixed genus $g$, there are two natural stacks, $\mathcal{RH}_g$ and $\widetilde{\mathcal{RH}}_g$, parametrizing hyperelliptic Prym pairs, with the former being the $\mu_2$-rigidification of the latter. Both decompose as the disjoint union of $\lfloor (g+1)/2 \rfloor$ components, denoted $\mathcal{RH}_g^n$ and $\widetilde{\mathcal{RH}}_g^n$ for $n = 1, \ldots, \lfloor (g+1)/2 \rfloor$. In this paper we present quotient stack descriptions of the components $\mathcal{RH}_g^n$ for even $g$ and compute their integral Chow rings, thereby completing the computation for all irreducible components of $\mathcal{RH}_g$. In addition, we give quotient stack presentations for all irreducible components of $\widetilde{\mathcal{RH}}_g$ and determine when the rigidification map $\widetilde{\mathcal{RH}}_g^n \to \mathcal{RH}_g^n$ is a root gerbe. We then use this to compute the Chow rings of $\widetilde{\mathcal{RH}}_g^n$ for all $g$ and $n$, with the sole exception of the case where $g$ is odd and $n=(g+1)/2$.
Finally, in the appendix, we discuss $G$-gerbes induced by an homomorphism of abelian groups $H \to G$ and an $H$-gerbe.

Optimal Delocalization for Non--Hermitian Eigenvectors

Probability (math.PR); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
We prove an optimal order delocalization estimate for the eigenvectors of general $N \times N$ non-Hermitian matrices $X$: $\| {\bf v } \|_\infty \leq C \sqrt{\frac{\log N}{N}}$ with very high probability, for any right or left eigenvector ${\bf v}$ of $X$. This improves upon the previous tightest bound of Rudelson and Vershynin [arXiv:1306.2887] of $\mathcal{O}( ( \log N)^{9/2}N^{-1/2})$, and holds under weaker assumptions on the tail of the matrix elements. In addition to the coordinate basis, our bound holds for the $\ell^\infty$ norm in any deterministic orthonormal basis. Our result is proven via a dynamical method, by studying the flow of the resolvent of the Hermitization of $X$ and proving local laws on short scales.

A non-sequential arithmetical theory with pairing
Juvenal Murwanashyaka
Subjects:
Logic (math.LO)
Albert Visser has shown that Robinson's $ \mathsf{Q} $ and Gregorczyk's $ \mathsf{TC} $ are not sequential by showing that these theories are not even poly-pair theories, which, in a strong sense, means these theories lack pairing. In this paper, we use Ehrenfeucht-Fraïssé games to show that the theory $ \mathsf{Q} + \Theta $ we obtain by extending Robinson's $ \mathsf{Q} $ with an axiom $ \Theta $ which says that the map $ \pi (x, y ) = (x+y)^2 + x $ is a pairing function is not sequential; in fact, we show that this theory is not even a Vaught theory. As a corollary, we get that the tree theory $ \mathsf{T} $ of [Kristiansen & Murwanashyaka, 2020] is also not a Vaught theory.

Consistent causal discovery with equal error variances: a least-squares perspective
Anamitra Chaudhuri, Yang Ni, Anirban Bhattacharya
Subjects:
Statistics Theory (math.ST); Methodology (stat.ME); Machine Learning (stat.ML)
We consider the problem of recovering the true causal structure among a set of variables, generated by a linear acyclic structural equation model (SEM) with the error terms being independent and having equal variances. It is well-known that the true underlying directed acyclic graph (DAG) encoding the causal structure is uniquely identifiable under this assumption. In this work, we establish that the sum of minimum expected squared errors for every variable, while predicted by the best linear combination of its parent variables, is minimised if and only if the causal structure is represented by any supergraph of the true DAG. This property is further utilised to design a Bayesian DAG selection method that recovers the true graph consistently.

Zeta functions of abstract isogeny graphs and modular curves
Jun Bo Lau, Travis Morrison, Eli Orvis, Gabrielle Scullard, Lukas Zobernig
Subjects:
Number Theory (math.NT)
We introduce a ``non-orientable'' variation of Serre's definition of a graph, which we call an abstract isogeny graph. These objects capture the combinatorics of the graphs $G(p,\ell,H)$, the $\ell$-isogeny graphs of supersingular elliptic curves with $H$-level structure. In particular they allow for the study of non-backtracking walks, primes, and zeta functions. We prove an analogue of Ihara's determinant formula for the zeta function of an abstract isogeny graph. For $B_1(N) \subseteq H \subseteq B_0(N)$ and $p > 3$, we use this formula to relate the Ihara zeta function of $G(p,\ell,H)$ to the Hasse-Weil zeta functions of the modular curves $X_{H, {\mathbb{F}_{\ell}}}$ and $X_{H \times B_0(p), \mathbb{F}_{\ell}}$. As applications, we give an explicit formula relating point counts on $X_0(pN)_{\mathbb{F}_{\ell}}$ and $X_0(N)_{\mathbb{F}_{\ell}}$ to cycle counts in $G(p,\ell,B_0(N))$ and prove that the number of non-backtracking cycles of length $r$ in $G(p,\ell,B_0(N))$ is asymptotic to $\ell^r$.

Variational Gaussian Approximation in Replica Analysis of Parametric Models

Subjects:

We revisit the replica method for analyzing inference and learning in parametric models, considering situations where the data-generating distribution is unknown or analytically intractable. Instead of assuming idealized distributions to carry out quenched averages analytically, we use a variational Gaussian approximation for the replicated system in grand canonical formalism in which the data average can be deferred and replaced by empirical averages, leading to stationarity conditions that adaptively determine the parameters of the trial Hamiltonian for each dataset. This approach clarifies how fluctuations affect information extraction and connects directly with the results of mathematical statistics or learning theory such as information criteria. As a concrete application, we analyze linear regression and derive learning curves. This includes cases with real-world datasets, where exact replica calculations are not feasible.

A Bayesian thinning algorithm for the point source identification of heat equation
Zhiliang Deng, Chen Li, Xiaomei Yang
Comments:
6 pages
Subjects:
Computation (stat.CO); Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
In this work, we propose a Bayesian thinning algorithm for recovering weighted point source functions in the heat equation from boundary flux observations. The major challenge in the classical Bayesian framework lies in constructing suitable priors for such highly structured unknowns. To address this, we introduce a level set representation on a discretized mesh for the unknown, which enables the infinite-dimensional Bayesian framework to the reconstruction. From another perspective, the point source configuration can be modeled as a marked Poisson point process (PPP), then a thinning mechanism is employed to selectively retain points. These two proposals are complementary with the Bayesian level set sampling generating candidate point sources and the thinning process acting as a filter to refine them. This combined framework is validated through numerical experiments, which demonstrate its accuracy in reconstructing point sources.

Graph-Enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Question Answering for E-Commerce Customer Support
Piyushkumar Patel
Subjects:
Computation and Language (cs.CL); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Information Theory (cs.IT)
E-Commerce customer support requires quick and accurate answers grounded in product data and past support cases. This paper develops a novel retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework that uses knowledge graphs (KGs) to improve the relevance of the answer and the factual grounding. We examine recent advances in knowledge-augmented RAG and chatbots based on large language models (LLM) in customer support, including Microsoft's GraphRAG and hybrid retrieval architectures. We then propose a new answer synthesis algorithm that combines structured subgraphs from a domain-specific KG with text documents retrieved from support archives, producing more coherent and grounded responses. We detail the architecture and knowledge flow of our system, provide comprehensive experimental evaluation, and justify its design in real-time support settings. Our implementation demonstrates 23\% improvement in factual accuracy and 89\% user satisfaction in e-Commerce QA scenarios.

Segmentation of the spacecraft transfer problem through overdetermined and continuity constraints based on the Theory of Functional Connections
Allan Kardec de Almeida Junior
Subjects:
Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Dynamical Systems (math.DS)
This paper introduces a segmented approach for solving constrained orbit transfer problems. The segments are connected through continuity constraints under the Theory of Functional Connections (TFC) mathematical framework that performs linear functional interpolation. This approach is further enhanced by a general vector formulation, from where the constrained functional is derived considering also a set of linear overdetermined constraints. Since we constrain vector instead of coordinates, this methodology allows to apply TFC to multiple and complex constraints composed by any types of nonlinear components included. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method on Earth-to-Moon transfers, showing that this segmented approach achieves solutions with several orders of magnitude greater accuracy and efficiency in comparison with unsegmented orbit transfers.

$\hat{Z}$-TQFT, Surgery Formulas, and New Algebras

The $\hat{Z}$ invariants of three-manifolds introduced by Gukov-Pei-Putrov-Vafa have influenced many areas of mathematics and physics. However, their TQFT structure remains poorly understood. In this work, we develop a framework of decorated $\mathrm{Spin}$-TQFTs and construct one based on Atiyah-Segal-like axioms that computes the $\hat{Z}$ invariants. Central to our approach is a novel quantization of $SL(2,\mathbb{C})$ Chern-Simons theory and a $\mathbb{Q}$-extension of the algebra of observables on the torus, from which we obtain the torus state space of the $\hat{Z}$-TQFT. Using the torus state space and topological invariance, we uniquely determine the $\hat{Z}$ invariants for negative-definite plumbed manifolds. Within this TQFT framework, we establish gluing, rational surgery, partial surgery, satellite, and cabling formulas, as well as explicit closed-form expressions for Seifert manifolds and torus link complements. We also generalize these constructions to higher-rank gauge groups.

Anyons, unique to two spatial dimensions, underlie extraordinary phenomena such as the fractional quantum Hall effect, but their generalization to higher dimensions has remained elusive. The topology of Eilenberg-MacLane spaces constrains the loop statistics to be only bosonic or fermionic in any dimension. In this work, we introduce the novel anyonic statistics for membrane excitations in four dimensions. Analogous to the $\mathbb{Z}_N$-particle exhibiting $\mathbb{Z}_{N\times \gcd(2,N)}$ anyonic statistics in two dimensions, we show that the $\mathbb{Z}_N$-membrane possesses $\mathbb{Z}_{N\times \gcd(3,N)}$ anyonic statistics in four dimensions. Given unitary volume operators that create membrane excitations on the boundary, we propose an explicit 56-step unitary sequence that detects the membrane statistics. We further analyze the boundary theory of $(5\!+\!1)$D 1-form $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetry-protected topological phases and demonstrate that their domain walls realize all possible anyonic membrane statistics. We then show that the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ subgroup persists in all higher dimensions. In addition to the standard fermionic $\mathbb{Z}_2$ membrane statistics arising from Stiefel-Whitney classes, membranes also exhibit $\mathbb{Z}_3$ statistics associated with Pontryagin classes. We explicitly verify that the 56-step process detects the nontrivial $\mathbb{Z}_3$ statistics in 5, 6, and 7 spatial dimensions. Moreover, in 7 and higher dimensions, the statistics of membrane excitations stabilize to $\mathbb{Z}_{2} \times \mathbb{Z}_{3}$, with the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ sector consistently captured by this process.

A no-go theorem for large $N$ closed universes

High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
Under conservative assumptions, it is established at a mathematical level of rigor that if correlation functions of single trace operators in a sequence of states of $O(N^0)$ energy of a two-sided holographic conformal field theory admit a large $N$ limit, then they must be described a pure state in the large $N$ Hilbert space of free field theory on two copies of vacuum AdS. This result clarifies recent discussions concerning the possible emergence of a semiclassical baby universe in the large $N$ limit of a low-energy partially entangled thermal state. The proof heavily relies on dominated convergence arguments from mathematical analysis. Some comments are also offered on the relationship between various recently proposed ways of restoring the emergence of the baby universe and the relaxation of different assumptions of the theorem.

Finite-size secret-key rates of discrete modulation CV QKD under passive attacks
Gabriele Staffieri, Giovanni Scala, Cosmo Lupo
Subjects:
Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
Quantum conditional entropies play a fundamental role in quantum information theory. In quantum key distribution, they are exploited to obtain reliable lower bounds on the secret-key rates in the finite-size regime, against collective attacks and coherent attacks under suitable assumptions. We consider continuous-variable communication protocols, where the sender Alice encodes information using a discrete modulation of phase-shifted coherent states, and the receiver Bob decodes by homodyne or heterodyne detection. We compute the Petz-Rényi and sandwiched Rényi conditional entropies associated with these setups, under the assumption of a passive eavesdropper who collects the quantum information leaked through a lossy communication line of known or bounded transmissivity. Whereas our results do not directly provide reliable key-rate estimates, they do represent useful ball-park figures. We obtain analytical or semi-analytical expressions that do not require intensive numerical calculations. These expressions serve as bounds on the key rates that may be tight in certain scenarios. We compare different estimates, including known bounds that have already appeared in the literature and new bounds. The latter are found to be tighter for very short block sizes.

Some remarks on invariants

The demand to know the structure of functionally independent invariants of tensor fields arises in many problems of theoretical and mathematical physics, for instance for the construction of interacting higher-order tensor field actions. In mathematical terms the problem can be formulated as follows. Given a semi-simple finite-dimensional Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$ and a $\mathfrak g$-module $V$, one may ask about the structure of the sub-ring of $\mathfrak g$-invariants inside the ring freely generated by the module. We point out how some information about the ring of invariants may be obtained by studying an extended Lie algebra. Numerous examples are given, with particular focus on the difficult problem of classifying invariants of a self-dual 5-form in 10 dimensions.

On Finite- and Fixed-Time Stabilization of Abstract Nonlinear Systems with Well-Posedness Guarantees
Kamal Fenza, Moussa Labbadi, Mohamed Ouzahra
Subjects:
Systems and Control (eess.SY); Optimization and Control (math.OC)
This paper addresses the problem of stabilization for infinite-dimensional systems. In particular, we design nonlinear stabilizers for both linear and nonlinear abstract systems. We focus on two classes of systems: the first class comprises linear abstract systems subject to matched perturbations, while the second class encompasses fully nonlinear abstract systems. Our main objective is to synthesize state-feedback controllers that guarantee finite- or fixed-time stability of the closed-loop system, along with possible estimation of the settling time. For the first class, the presence of persistent perturbations introduces significant challenges in the well-posedness analysis, particularly due to the discontinuous nature of the control law. To address this, we employ maximal monotone operator theory to rigorously establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions, extending classical results from continuous abstract systems. For the second class, which includes nonlinearities, we further show that the proposed feedback law ensures fixed-time stability and well-posedness of the closed-loop system, again using maximal monotone theory. The results provide a unified framework for robust, finite /fixed-time stabilization in the presence of discontinuities and nonlinearities in infinite-dimensional settings.

Machine Learning (cs.LG); Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
In this paper, we investigate the efficiency of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to approximate the solution of a nonlocal conservation law derived from the identical-oscillator Kuramoto model, focusing on the evaluation of an architectural choice and its impact on solution accuracy based on the energy norm and computation time. Through systematic experimentation, we demonstrate that network configuration parameters-specifically, activation function selection (tanh vs. sin vs. ReLU), network depth (4-8 hidden layers), width (64-256 neurons), and training methodology (collocation points, epoch count)-significantly influence convergence characteristics. We observe that tanh activation yields stable convergence across configurations, whereas sine activation can attain marginally lower errors and training times in isolated cases, but occasionally produce nonphysical artefacts. Our comparative analysis with traditional numerical methods shows that optimally configured DNNs offer competitive accuracy with notably different computational trade-offs. Furthermore, we identify fundamental limitations of standard feed-forward architectures when handling singular or piecewise-constant solutions, providing empirical evidence that such networks inherently oversmooth sharp features due to the natural function space limitations of standard activation functions. This work contributes to the growing body of research on neural network-based scientific computing by providing practitioners with empirical guidelines for DNN implementation while illuminating fundamental theoretical constraints that must be overcome to expand their applicability to more challenging physical systems with discontinuities.

UTOPY: Unrolling Algorithm Learning via Fidelity Homotopy for Inverse Problems

Subjects:
Image and Video Processing (eess.IV); Optimization and Control (math.OC)
Imaging Inverse problems aim to reconstruct an underlying image from undersampled, coded, and noisy observations. Within the wide range of reconstruction frameworks, the unrolling algorithm is one of the most popular due to the synergistic integration of traditional model-based reconstruction methods and modern neural networks, providing an interpretable and highly accurate reconstruction. However, when the sensing operator is highly ill-posed, gradient steps on the data-fidelity term can hinder convergence and degrade reconstruction quality. To address this issue, we propose UTOPY, a homotopy continuation formulation for training the unrolling algorithm. Mainly, this method involves using a well-posed (synthetic) sensing matrix at the beginning of the unrolling network optimization. We define a continuation path strategy to transition smoothly from the synthetic fidelity to the desired ill-posed problem. This strategy enables the network to progressively transition from a simpler, well-posed inverse problem to the more challenging target scenario. We theoretically show that, for projected gradient descent-like unrolling models, the proposed continuation strategy generates a smooth path of unrolling solutions. Experiments on compressive sensing and image deblurring demonstrate that our method consistently surpasses conventional unrolled training, achieving up to 2.5 dB PSNR improvement in reconstruction performance.

We study the cosmological dynamics of non-minimally coupled matter models using the Brown's variational approach to relativistic fluids in General Relativity. After decomposing the Ricci scalar into a bulk and a boundary term, we construct new models by coupling the bulk term to the fluid variables and an external scalar field. Using dynamical systems techniques, we study models of this type and find that they can give rise to both early-time inflationary behaviour and late-time accelerated expansion. Moreover, these models also contain very interesting features that are rarely seen in this context. For example, we find dark energy models which exhibit phantom crossing in the recent past. Other possibilities include models that give a viable past evolution but terminate in a matter-dominated universe. The dynamical systems themselves display an array of mathematically interesting phenomena, including spirals, centres, and non-trivial bifurcations depending on the chosen parameter values.

We study the problem of pure exploration in matching markets under uncertain preferences, where the goal is to identify a stable matching with confidence parameter $\delta$ and minimal sample complexity. Agents learn preferences via stochastic rewards, with expected values indicating preferences. This finds use in labor market platforms like Upwork, where firms and freelancers must be matched quickly despite noisy observations and no prior knowledge, in a stable manner that prevents dissatisfaction. We consider markets with unique stable matching and establish information-theoretic lower bounds on sample complexity for (1) one-sided learning, where one side of the market knows its true preferences, and (2) two-sided learning, where both sides are uncertain. We propose a computationally efficient algorithm and prove that it asymptotically ($\delta\to 0$) matches the lower bound to a constant for one-sided learning. Using the insights from the lower bound, we extend our algorithm to the two-sided learning setting and provide experimental results showing that it closely matches the lower bound on sample complexity. Finally, using a system of ODEs, we characterize the idealized fluid path that our algorithm chases.

Mixed order phase transition in a locally constrained exclusion process
Gunter Schutz, Ali Zahra
Subjects:
Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
We investigate a novel variant of the exclusion process in which particles perform asymmetric nearest-neighbor jumps across a bond \((k, k+1)\) only if the preceding site \((k-1)\) is unoccupied. This next-nearest-neighbor constraint significantly enriches the system's dynamics, giving rise to long-range correlations and a mixed-order transition controlled by the asymmetry parameter. We focus on the critical case of half filling, where the system splits into two ergodic components, each associated with an invariant reversible measure. The combinatorial structure of this equilibrium distribution is intimately connected to the \(q\)-Catalan numbers, enabling us to derive rigorously the asymptotic behavior of key thermodynamic quantities in the strongly asymmetric regime and to conjecture their behavior in the weakly asymmetric limit. Even though the system is one-dimensional and has short-range interactions, an equilibrium phase transition occurs between a clustered phase -- characterized by slow dynamics, long-range correlations with thermodynamic additivity, and spontaneous breaking of translational symmetry -- and a fluid phase where the correlations are short-range and which is thermodynamically additive. This equilibrium phase transition features characteristics of a first-order transition, such as a discontinuous order parameter as well as characteristics of a second-order transition, namely a divergent susceptibility at the transition point. We also briefly discuss density higher than one half where ergodicity is broken.

Decentralized Optimization with Topology-Independent Communication

Comments:
36 pages
Subjects:
Machine Learning (cs.LG); Optimization and Control (math.OC)
Distributed optimization requires nodes to coordinate, yet full synchronization scales poorly. When $n$ nodes collaborate through $m$ pairwise regularizers, standard methods demand $\mathcal{O}(m)$ communications per iteration. This paper proposes randomized local coordination: each node independently samples one regularizer uniformly and coordinates only with nodes sharing that term. This exploits partial separability, where each regularizer $G_j$ depends on a subset $S_j \subseteq \{1,\ldots,n\}$ of nodes. For graph-guided regularizers where $|S_j|=2$, expected communication drops to exactly 2 messages per iteration. This method achieves $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\varepsilon^{-2})$ iterations for convex objectives and under strong convexity, $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-1})$ to an $\varepsilon$-solution and $\mathcal{O}(\log(1/\varepsilon))$ to a neighborhood. Replacing the proximal map of the sum $\sum_j G_j$ with the proximal map of a single randomly selected regularizer $G_j$ preserves convergence while eliminating global coordination. Experiments validate both convergence rates and communication efficiency across synthetic and real-world datasets.

Rate doubly robust estimation for weighted average treatment effects

Subjects:
Methodology (stat.ME); Statistics Theory (math.ST); Machine Learning (stat.ML)
The weighted average treatment effect (WATE) defines a versatile class of causal estimands for populations characterized by propensity score weights, including the average treatment effect (ATE), treatment effect on the treated (ATT), on controls (ATC), and for the overlap population (ATO). WATE has broad applicability in social and medical research, as many datasets from these fields align with its framework. However, the literature lacks a systematic investigation into the robustness and efficiency conditions for WATE estimation. Although doubly robust (DR) estimators are well-studied for ATE, their applicability to other WATEs remains uncertain. This paper investigates whether widely used WATEs admit DR or rate doubly robust (RDR) estimators and assesses the role of nuisance function accuracy, particularly with machine learning. Using semiparametric efficient influence function (EIF) theory and double/debiased machine learning (DML), we propose three RDR estimators under specific rate and regularity conditions and evaluate their performance via Monte Carlo simulations. Applications to NHANES data on smoking and blood lead levels, and SIPP data on 401(k) eligibility, demonstrate the methods' practical relevance in medical and social sciences.

Unbiased Rough Integrators and No Free Lunch in Rough-Path-Based Market Models

Comments:

Built to generalise classical stochastic calculus, rough path theory provides a natural and pathwise framework to model continuous non-semimartingale assets. This paper investigates the ultimate capacity of this framework to support frictionless continuous No-Free-Lunch markets à la Kreps-Yan. We establish a ``Rough Kreps-Yan" theorem, which links our No Controlled Free Lunch (NCFL) condition to the unbiasedness of the driver of the price process as a rough integrator. The central work of this paper is a complete classification of these unbiased rough integrators with respect to different classes of controlled paths as integrands. As the set of admissible trading strategies is enlarged to include Markovian-type and signature-type portfolios, the only admissible random rough paths must be infinitesimally close to the Itô rough path lift of a standard Brownian motion, up to a time change. In particular, Gaussianity is no longer a model assumption, but rather a no-arbitrage market consequence. Notably, simple strategies do not appear in the theory, and if they are then reintroduced, the rough noise is further enforced to be the Itô rough path of Brownian motion itself. Ultimately, this implies that continuous frictionless markets based on rough path theory are inevitably constrained to the semimartingale paradigm, providing a definitive answer on the limits of this approach. Our framework covers $\alpha-$Hölder continuous rough paths for $\alpha>0$ arbitrarily small.

Large models recently are widely applied in artificial intelligence, so efficient training of large models has received widespread attention. More recently, a useful Muon optimizer is specifically designed for matrix-structured parameters of large models. Although some works have begun to studying Muon optimizer, the existing Muon and its variants still suffer from high sample complexity or high memory for large models. To fill this gap, we propose a light and fast Muon (LiMuon) optimizer for training large models, which builds on the momentum-based variance reduced technique and randomized Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). Our LiMuon optimizer has a lower memory than the current Muon and its variants. Moreover, we prove that our LiMuon has a lower sample complexity of $O(\epsilon^{-3})$ for finding an $\epsilon$-stationary solution of non-convex stochastic optimization under the smooth condition. Recently, the existing convergence analysis of Muon optimizer mainly relies on the strict Lipschitz smooth assumption, while some artificial intelligence tasks such as training large language models (LLMs) do not satisfy this condition. We also proved that our LiMuon optimizer has a sample complexity of $O(\epsilon^{-3})$ under the generalized smooth condition. Numerical experimental results on training DistilGPT2 and ViT models verify efficiency of our LiMuon optimizer.

Support-Projected Petz Monotone Geometry of Two-Qubit Families: Three-Channel Identity and Non-Reduction of Curvatures
Gunhee Cho, Jeongwoo Jae
Subjects:
Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Differential Geometry (math.DG)
We investigate the information geometry of pure two-qubit variational families by pulling back arbitrary Petz monotone quantum metrics to circuit-defined submanifolds and making them intrinsic via support projection onto the active numerical range of the quantum Fisher information tensor. This framework strictly generalizes the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD/Bures) case and includes, as special examples, the Wigner-Yanase and Bogoliubov-Kubo-Mori metrics among many others. Our first main theorem proves a universal three-channel decomposition for every Petz monotone metric on any smooth two-parameter slice in terms of the population, coherence, and concurrence of the one-qubit reduction. Second, we show that neither the slice Gaussian curvature nor the ambient scalar curvature of the support-projected metric can, on any nonempty open set, be written as functions solely of concurrence or of the one-qubit entropy. Third, an entanglement-orthogonal gauge isolates the pure entanglement derivative channel and provides intrinsic curvature diagnostics. These results rigorously disprove the expectation that scalar or Gaussian curvatures of finite-dimensional monotone metrics could serve as universal entanglement monotones, extending the counterexamples previously known for the SLD/Bures metric, and complementing recent analyses in Gaussian quantum states. They also furnish a Petz-metric foundation for curvature-aware natural-gradient methods in variational quantum algorithms.

Online reinforcement learning via sparse Gaussian mixture model Q-functions
Minh Vu, Konstantinos Slavakis
Subjects:
Machine Learning (cs.LG); Optimization and Control (math.OC)
This paper introduces a structured and interpretable online policy-iteration framework for reinforcement learning (RL), built around the novel class of sparse Gaussian mixture model Q-functions (S-GMM-QFs). Extending earlier work that trained GMM-QFs offline, the proposed framework develops an online scheme that leverages streaming data to encourage exploration. Model complexity is regulated through sparsification by Hadamard overparametrization, which mitigates overfitting while preserving expressiveness. The parameter space of S-GMM-QFs is naturally endowed with a Riemannian manifold structure, allowing for principled parameter updates via online gradient descent on a smooth objective. Numerical tests show that S-GMM-QFs match the performance of dense deep RL (DeepRL) methods on standard benchmarks while using significantly fewer parameters, and maintain strong performance even in low-parameter-count regimes where sparsified DeepRL methods fail to generalize.

A generalization of the beam problem: Connection to multi-component Camassa-Holm dynamics

Subjects:

We extend the Euler-Bernoulli beam problem, formulated as a matrix string equation with a matrix-valued density, to a setting where the density takes values in a Clifford algebra, and we analyze its isospectral deformations. For discrete densities, we prove that the associated matrix Weyl function admits a Stieltjes-type continued fraction expansion with Clifford-valued coefficients. By mapping the problem from the finite interval to the real line, we uncover a direct link to a multi-component generalization of the Camassa-Holm equation. This yields a vectorized form of the Camassa-Holm equation invariant under arbitrary orthogonal group actions. As an illustration, we examine the dynamics of a two-atom (two-peakon) matrix measure in the special case of a Clifford algebra with two generators and Minkowski signature. Our analysis shows that, even when peakon waves remain spatially separated, they can engage in long-range, synchronized energy exchange.

We derive generalized geodesic equations in curved spacetime that include conservative forces, dissipative effects, and quantum-gravity-motivated minimal-length corrections. Conservative interactions are incorporated through external vector potentials, while dissipative dynamics arise from an exponential rescaling of the particle Lagrangian. Quantum-gravity effects are introduced via Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) deformed Poisson brackets in the Hamiltonian framework. We show that free-particle geodesics remain unaffected at leading order, but external potentials induce velocity-dependent corrections, implying possible violations of the equivalence principle. As an application, we analyze modified trajectories in Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universes dominated by dust, radiation, stiff matter, and dark energy. Our results establish a unified approach to conservative, dissipative, and GUP-corrected geodesics, providing a framework to probe the interplay between external forces, spacetime curvature, and Planck-scale physics.

This paper revisits a three-loop spatial linkage that was proposed in an ARK 2004 paper by Karl Wohlhart (as extension of a two-loop linkage proposed by Eddie Baker in 1980) and later analyzed in an ARK 2006 paper by Diez-Martinez et. al. A local analysis shows that this linkage has a finite degree of freedom (DOF) 3 (and is thus overconstrained) while in its reference configuration the differential DOF is 5. It is shown that its configuration space is locally a smooth manifold so that the reference configuration is not a c-space singularity. It is shown that the differential DOF is locally constant, which makes this linkage shaky (so that the reference configuration is not a singularity). The higher-order local analysis is facilitated by the computation of the kinematic tangent cone as well as a local approximation of the c-space.

Fracture interactive geodesic active contours for bone segmentation

For bone segmentation, the classical geodesic active contour model is usually limited by its indiscriminate feature extraction, and then struggles to handle the phenomena of edge obstruction, edge leakage and bone fracture. Thus, we propose a fracture interactive geodesic active contour algorithm tailored for bone segmentation, which can better capture bone features and perform robustly to the presence of bone fractures and soft tissues. Inspired by orthopedic knowledge, we construct a novel edge-detector function that combines the intensity and gradient norm, which guides the contour towards bone edges without being obstructed by other soft tissues and therefore reduces mis-segmentation. Furthermore, distance information, where fracture prompts can be embedded, is introduced into the contour evolution as an adaptive step size to stabilize the evolution and help the contour stop at bone edges and fractures. This embedding provides a way to interact with bone fractures and improves the accuracy in the fracture regions. Experiments in pelvic and ankle segmentation demonstrate the effectiveness on addressing the aforementioned problems and show an accurate, stable and consistent performance, indicating a broader application in other bone anatomies. Our algorithm also provides insights into combining the domain knowledge and deep neural networks.

Personalized cardiac diagnostics require accurate reconstruction of myocardial displacement fields from sparse clinical imaging data, yet current methods often demand intrusive access to computational models. In this work, we apply the non-intrusive Parametrized-Background Data-Weak (PBDW) approach to three-dimensional (3D) cardiac displacement field reconstruction from limited Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI)-like observations. Our implementation requires only solution snapshots -- no governing equations, assembly routines, or solver access -- enabling immediate deployment across commercial and research codes using different constitutive models. Additionally, we introduce two enhancements: an H-size minibatch worst-case Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (wOMP) algorithm that improves Sensor Selection (SS) computational efficiency while maintaining reconstruction accuracy, and memory optimization techniques exploiting block matrix structures in vectorial problems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method through validation on a 3D left ventricular model with simulated scar tissue. Starting with noise-free reconstruction, we systematically incorporate Gaussian noise and spatial sparsity mimicking realistic MRI acquisition protocols. Results show exceptional accuracy in noise-free conditions (relative L2 error of order O(1e-5)), robust performance with 10% noise (relative L2 error of order O(1e-2)), and effective reconstruction from sparse measurements (relative L2 error of order O(1e-2)). The online reconstruction achieves four-order-of-magnitude computational speed-up compared to full Finite Element (FE) simulations, with reconstruction times under one tenth of second for sparse scenarios, demonstrating significant potential for integration into clinical cardiac modeling workflows.

Understanding Modal Interactions in Non-classically Damped Linear Oscillators with Closely Spaced Modes

Subjects:
Classical Physics (physics.class-ph); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
This work addresses non-classically damped coupled oscillators with closely spaced modes focusing on the physics of modal interactions. Considering the simplest representative example in the form of an impulsively excited two-degree-of-freedom (two-DOF) system, we show that there is a single parameter defined as a coupling versus damping non-proportionality ratio, that separates two different dynamical regimes. Based on complexification-averaging analysis, we show that, below the critical value of this parameter, the system response possesses two distinct dissipation rates but only one frequency of oscillation; as a result, energy is slowly exchanged between modes in a single beat phenomenon. However, above the critical parameter value, the response has a single dissipation rate but two distinct oscillation frequencies; this yields an infinity of beat phenomena as energy is interchanged at a faster rate between modes. Our analytical predictions are fully validated by experimental measurements. Our findings highlight the physics of modal interactions in coupled oscillators and provide a framework for system identification and reduced-order modeling of systems with closely spaced modes.

We introduce a new adaptive step-size strategy for convex optimization with stochastic gradient that exploits the local geometry of the objective function only by means of a first-order stochastic oracle and without any hyper-parameter tuning. The method comes from a theoretically-grounded adaptation of the Adaptive Gradient Descent Without Descent method to the stochastic setting. We prove the convergence of stochastic gradient descent with our step-size under various assumptions, and we show that it empirically competes against tuned baselines.

Domain Wall Skyrmions in Holographic Quantum Chromodynamics: Topological Phases and Phase Transitions

We investigate the domain wall skyrmions phase in the framework of holographic quantum chromodynamics (QCD) using the Sakai-Sugimoto model. Building on previous work regarding chiral soliton lattices (CSLs) in strong magnetic fields, we study the emergence of localized skyrmions a top domain walls formed by CSLs. These skyrmions, realized as undissolved D4-branes embedded in the D8-branes, carry baryon number two and exhibit complex topological and energetic features. We explore the interplay between magnetic field strength, pion mass, and baryon chemical potential in stabilizing these configurations and demonstrate the existence of a mixed CSL-skyrmions phase. Through systematic energy analysis, we establish that the domain wall skyrmions become energetically favorable when $\mu_B |B| \gtrsim \Lambda \cdot m_\pi f_\pi^2$, with the transition occurring around $\mu_B |B| \sim 4.5$ in our holographic framework. Our phase diagram reveals three distinct regions: the CSL phase at low chemical potential and magnetic field, the domain wall skyrmions phase at intermediate scales, and a conjectured skyrmions crystal phase at the highest densities. The instanton density profiles $\text{Tr}(F \wedge F)$ show sharp localization in the domain wall skyrmions phase, contrasting with the smooth, extended distribution characteristic of the pure CSL configuration. These findings provide non-perturbative insights into baryonic matter in the dense QCD and offer a geometrical picture of topological phase transitions via string theory duality, with potential applications to neutron star physics and the broader QCD phase diagram under extreme conditions.

On Uniformly Time-Varying Control Barrier Functions

13 pages, 7 figures
Subjects:
Systems and Control (eess.SY); Optimization and Control (math.OC)
This paper investigates the design of a subclass of time-varying Control Barrier Functions (CBFs), specifically that of uniformly time-varying CBFs. Leveraging the fact that CBFs encode a system's dynamic capabilities relative to a state constraint, we decouple the design of uniformly time-varying CBFs into a time-invariant and a time-varying component. We characterize the subclass of time-invariant CBFs that yield a uniformly time-varying CBF when combined with a specific type of time-varying function. A detailed analysis of those conditions under which the time-varying function preserves the CBF property of the time-invariant component is provided. These conditions allow for selecting the time-varying function such that diverse variations in the state constraints can be captured while avoiding the redesign of the time-invariant component. From a technical point of view, the analysis requires the derivation of novel relations for comparison functions, not previously reported in the literature. We further relax the requirements on the time-varying function, showing that forward invariance can still be ensured even when the uniformly time-varying value function does not strictly constitute a CBF. Finally, we discuss how existing CBF construction methods can be applied to design suitable time-invariant CBFs, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach through detailed numerical examples.

Probabilistic and nonlinear compressive sensing

We present a smooth probabilistic reformulation of $\ell_0$ regularized regression that does not require Monte Carlo sampling and allows for the computation of exact gradients, facilitating rapid convergence to local optima of the best subset selection problem. The method drastically improves convergence speed compared to similar Monte Carlo based approaches. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that it outperforms compressive sensing algorithms such as IHT and (Relaxed-) Lasso across a wide range of settings and signal-to-noise ratios. The implementation runs efficiently on both CPUs and GPUs and is freely available at this https URL.
We also contribute to research on nonlinear generalizations of compressive sensing by investigating when parameter recovery of a nonlinear teacher network is possible through compression of a student network. Building upon theorems of Fefferman and Markel, we show theoretically that the global optimum in the infinite-data limit enforces recovery up to certain symmetries. For empirical validation, we implement a normal-form algorithm that selects a canonical representative within each symmetry class. However, while compression can help to improve test loss, we find that exact parameter recovery is not even possible up to symmetries. In particular, we observe a surprising rebound effect where teacher and student configurations initially converge but subsequently diverge despite continuous decrease in test loss. These findings indicate fundamental differences between linear and nonlinear compressive sensing.

Efficient Computation of Time-Index Powered Weighted Sums Using Cascaded Accumulators

This letter presents a novel approach for \mbox{efficiently} computing time-index powered weighted sums of the form $\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} n^{K} v[n]$ using cascaded accumulators. Traditional direct computation requires $K{\times}N$ general multiplications, which become prohibitive for large $N$, while alternative strategies based on lookup tables or signal reversal require storing entire data blocks. By exploiting accumulator properties, the proposed method eliminates the need for such storage and reduces the multiplicative cost to only $K{+}1$ constant multiplications, enabling efficient real-time implementation. The approach is particularly useful when such sums need to be efficiently computed in sample-by-sample processing systems.

Determining the ultimate limits of quantum communication, such as the quantum capacity of a channel and the distillable entanglement of a shared state, remains a central challenge in quantum information theory, primarily due to the phenomenon of superadditivity. This work develops Riemannian optimization methods to establish significantly tighter, computable two-sided bounds on these fundamental quantities. For upper bounds, our method systematically searches for state and channel extensions that minimize known information-theoretic bounds. We achieve this by parameterizing the space of all possible extensions as a Stiefel manifold, enabling a universal search that overcomes the limitations of ad-hoc constructions. Combined with an improved upper bound on the one-way distillable entanglement based on a refined continuity bound on quantum conditional entropy, our approach yields new state-of-the-art upper bounds on the quantum capacity of the qubit depolarizing channel for large values of the depolarizing parameter, strictly improving the previously best-known bounds. For lower bounds, we introduce Riemannian optimization methods to compute multi-shot coherent information. We establish lower bounds on the one-way distillable entanglement by parameterizing quantum instruments on the unitary manifold, and on the quantum capacity by parameterizing code states with a product of unitary manifolds. Numerical results for noisy entangled states and different channels demonstrate that our methods successfully unlock superadditive gains, improving previous results. Together, these findings establish Riemannian optimization as a principled and powerful tool for navigating the complex landscape of quantum communication limits. Furthermore, we prove that amortization does not enhance the channel coherent information, thereby closing a potential avenue for improving capacity lower bounds in general.

Strong converse exponent of channel interconversion

Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Information Theory (cs.IT)
In their seminal work, Bennett et al. [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory (2002)] showed that, with sufficient shared randomness, one noisy channel can simulate another at a rate equal to the ratio of their capacities. We establish that when coding above this channel interconversion capacity, the exact strong converse exponent is characterized by a simple optimization involving the difference of the corresponding Rényi channel capacities with Hölder dual parameters. We further extend this result to the entanglement-assisted interconversion of classical-quantum channels, showing that the strong converse exponent is likewise determined by differences of sandwiched Rényi channel capacities. The converse bound is obtained by relaxing to non-signaling assisted codes and applying Hölder duality together with the data processing inequality for Rényi divergences. Achievability is proven by concatenating refined channel coding and simulation protocols that go beyond first-order capacities, attaining an exponentially small conversion error, remaining robust under small variations in the input distribution, and tolerating a sublinear gap between the conversion rates.

Positive maps and extendibility hierarchies from copositive matrices

Subjects:

The characterization of positive, non-CP linear maps is a central problem in operator algebras and quantum information theory, where such maps serve as entanglement witnesses. This work introduces and systematically studies a new convex cone of PCOP (pairwise copositive). We establish that this cone is dual to the cone of PCP (pairwise completely positive) and, critically, provides a complete characterization for the positivity of the broad class of covariant maps. We provide a way to lift matrices from the classical cone of COP to PCOP, thereby creating a powerful bridge between the well-studied theory of copositive forms and the structure of positive maps. We develop an analogous framework for decomposable maps, introducing the cone PDEC. As a primary application of this framework, we define a novel family of linear maps $\Phi_t^G$ parameterized by a graph $G$ and a real parameter $t$. We derive exact thresholds on $t$ that determine when these maps are positive or decomposable, linking these properties to fundamental graph-theoretic parameters. This construction yields vast new families of positive indecomposable maps, for which we provide explicit examples derived from infinite classes of graphs, most notably rank 3 strongly regular graphs such as Paley graphs.
On the dual side, we investigate the entanglement properties of large classes of symmetric states, such as the Dicke states. We prove that the sum-of-squares (SOS) hierarchies used in polynomial optimization to approximate the cone of copositive matrices correspond precisely to dual cones of witnesses for different levels of the PPT bosonic extendibility hierarchy. Leveraging this duality, we provide an explicit construction of bipartite (mixture of) Dicke states that are simultaneously entangled and $\mathcal{K}_r$-PPT bosonic extendible for any desired hierarchy level $r \geq 2$ and local dimension $n \geq 5$.

Subjects:
Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Category Theory (math.CT)
We propose a new theory of (non-split) P^n-functors. These are F: A -> B for which the adjunction monad RF is a repeated extension of Id_A by powers of an autoequivalence H and three conditions are satisfied: the monad condition, the adjoints condition, and the highest degree term condition. This unifies and extends the two earlier notions of spherical functors and split P^n-functors. We construct the P-twist of such F and prove it to be an autoequivalence. We then give a criterion for F to be a P^n-functor which is stronger than the definition but much easier to check in practice. It involves only two conditions: the strong monad condition and the weak adjoints condition. For split P^n-functors, we prove Segal's conjecture on their relation to spherical functors. Finally, we give four examples of non-split P^n-functors: spherical functors, extensions by zero, cyclic covers, and family P-twists. For the latter, we show the P-twist to be the derived monodromy of associated Mukai flop, the so-called `flop-flop = twist' formula.

An isogeny class $\mathcal{A}$ of abelian varieties defined over finite fields is said to be "cyclic" if every variety in $\mathcal{A}$ has a cyclic group of rational points. In this paper we study the local cyclicity of Weil-central isogeny classes of abelian varieties, i.e. those with Weil polynomials of the form $f_\mathcal{A}(t)=t^{2g}+at^g+q^g$, as well as the local growth of the groups of rational points of the varieties in $\mathcal{A}$ after finite field extensions. We exploit the criterion: an isogeny class $\mathcal{A}$ with Weil polynomial $f$ is cyclic if and only if $f'(1)$ is coprime with $f(1)$ divided by its radical.

Given a G-equivariant rank one local system L on the general fiber of the quotient map f : V --> V/G, we compute the Fourier transform of the corresponding nearby cycle sheaf P on the zero-fiber of f. This provides a partial generalization of the results of [Gr1] and [GVX1]. Our main intended application is to the theory of character sheaves for graded Lie algebras over C.

We show that every open Riemann surface can be obtained by glueing together a countable collection of equilateral triangles, in such a way that every vertex belongs to finitely many triangles. Equivalently, it is a _Belyi surface_: There exists a holomorphic branched covering to the Riemann sphere that is branched only over three values. It follows that every Riemann surface is a branched cover of the sphere, branched only over finitely many points.

Universality of SIS epidemics starting from small initial conditions

We are investigating deterministic SIS dynamics on large networks starting from only a few infected individuals. Under mild assumptions we show that any two epidemic curves - on the same network and with the same parameters - are almost identical up to time translation when initial conditions are small enough regardless of how infections are distributed at the beginning. The limit object - an epidemic starting from the infinite past with infinitesimal prevalence - is identified as the nontrivial eternal solution connecting the disease free state with the endemic equilibrium. Our framework covers several benchmark models including the N-Intertwined Mean Field Approximation (NIMFA) and the Inhomogeneous Mean Field Approximation (IMFA).

Statistical tools which satisfy rigorous privacy guarantees are necessary for modern data analysis. It is well-known that robustness against contamination is linked to differential privacy. Despite this fact, using multivariate medians for differentially private and robust multivariate location estimation has not been systematically studied. We develop novel finite-sample performance guarantees for differentially private multivariate depth-based medians, which are essentially sharp. Our results cover commonly used depth functions, such as the halfspace (or Tukey) depth, spatial depth, and the integrated dual depth. We show that under Cauchy marginals, the cost of heavy-tailed location estimation outweighs the cost of privacy. We demonstrate our results numerically using a Gaussian contamination model in dimensions up to $d = 100$, and compare them to a state-of-the-art private mean estimation algorithm. As a by-product of our investigation, we prove concentration inequalities for the output of the exponential mechanism about the maximizer of the population objective function. This bound applies to objective functions that satisfy a mild regularity condition.

Title:
Dual spaces of geodesic currents
Luca De Rosa, Dídac Martínez-Granado
Comments:
Final version. Accepted for publication in the Journal of Topology
Subjects:
Geometric Topology (math.GT)
Every geodesic current on a hyperbolic surface has an associated dual space. If the current is a lamination, this dual embeds isometrically into a real tree. We show that, in general, the dual space is a Gromov hyperbolic metric tree-graded space, and express its Gromov hyperbolicity constant in terms of the geodesic current. In the case of geodesic currents with no atoms and full support, such as those coming from certain higher rank representations, we show the duals are homeomorphic to the surface. We also analyze the completeness of the dual and the properties of the action of the fundamental group of the surface on the dual. Furthermore, we compare two natural topologies in the space of duals.

Coercive quadratic converse ISS Lyapunov theorems for linear analytic systems

Comments:
22 pages, revised version, shortened proofs and presentation significantly
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
We derive converse Lyapunov theorems for input-to-state stability (ISS) of linear infinite-dimensional analytic systems. We show that input-to-state stability of a linear system does not imply existence of a coercive quadratic ISS Lyapunov function, even if the input operator is bounded. If, however, the semigroup is similar to a contraction semigroup on a Hilbert space, then a quadratic ISS Lyapunov function always exists for any input operator that is bounded, or more generally, $p$-admissible with $p<2$. The constructions are semi-explicit and, in the case of self-adjoint generators, coincide with the canonical Lyapunov function being the norm squared. Finally, we construct a family of non-coercive ISS Lyapunov functions for analytic ISS systems under weaker assumptions on $B$.

Measurable bounded cohomology of measured groupoids

We introduce the notion of measurable bounded cohomology for measured groupoids, extending continuous bounded cohomology of locally compact groups. We show that the measurable bounded cohomology of the semidirect groupoid associated to a measure class preserving action of a locally compact group $G$ on a standard Borel space is isomorphic to the continuous bounded cohomology of $G$ with twisted coefficients. We also prove the invariance of measurable bounded cohomology under similarity. As an application, we compare the bounded cohomology of (weakly) orbit equivalent actions and of measure equivalent groups. In this way we recover an isomorphism in bounded cohomology similar to one proved by Monod and Shalom. Other relevant consequences are related to the cohomological vanishing for actions of the Thompson group $F$, of higher rank lattices and of lattices in products of locally compact groups. We obtain a variant of the Eckmann-Shapiro isomorphism for transitive actions. In the case of a higher rank simple Lie group, we show that the cohomology of the action is actually determined by the usual cohomology of a suitable lattice. For amenable groupoids, we prove that the measurable bounded cohomology is trivial. This generalizes previous results by Monod, Anantharaman-Delaroche and Renault, and Blank.

($\mathfrak{S}_p \times \mathfrak{S}_q$)-Invariant Graphical Parking Functions
Lauren Snider, Catherine Yan
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
Graphical parking functions, or $G$-parking functions, are a generalization of classical parking functions which depend on a connected multigraph $G$ having a distinguished root vertex. Gaydarov and Hopkins characterized the relationship between $G$-parking functions and another vector-dependent generalization of parking functions, the $\boldsymbol{u}$-parking functions. The crucial component of their result was their classification of all graphs $G$ whose $G$-parking functions are invariant under action by the symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}_n$, where $n+1$ is the order of $G$. In this work, we present a 2-dimensional analogue of Gaydarov and Hopkins' results by characterizing the overlap between $G$-parking functions and 2-dimensional $\boldsymbol{U}$-parking functions, i.e., pairs of integer sequences whose order statistics are bounded by certain weights along lattice paths in the plane. Our key result is a total classification of all $G$ whose set of $G$-parking functions is $(\mathfrak{S}_p \times \mathfrak{S}_q)$-invariant, where $p+q+1$ is the order of $G$.

Electric Vehicle Fleet and Charging Infrastructure Planning
Sushil Mahavir Varma, Francisco Castro, Siva Theja Maguluri
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
We study electric vehicle (EV) fleet and charging infrastructure planning in a spatial setting. With customer requests arriving continuously at rate $\lambda$ throughout the day, we determine the minimum number of vehicles and chargers for a target service level, along with matching and charging policies. While non-EV systems require extra $\Theta(\lambda^{2/3})$ vehicles due to pickup times, EV systems differ. Charging increases nominal capacity, enabling pickup time reductions and allowing for an extra fleet requirement of only $\Theta(\lambda^{\nu})$ for $\nu \in (1/2, 2/3]$, depending on charging infrastructure and battery pack sizes. We propose the Power-of-$d$ dispatching policy, which achieves this performance by selecting the closest vehicle with the highest battery level from $d$ options. We extend our results to accommodate time-varying demand patterns and discuss conditions for transitioning between EV and non-EV capacity planning. Extensive simulations verify our scaling results, insights, and policy effectiveness while also showing the viability of low-range, low-cost fleets.

Fixation and stationary times for the $Λ$-Wright-Fisher process
Airam Blancas, Adrián González Casanova, Sebastian Hummel, Sandra Palau
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
We study the fixation and stationary behavior of the Lambda-Wright-Fisher process with parent-independent mutation and finitely many types, a jump-diffusion model for allele frequency dynamics in large populations with potentially large offspring variance. Using a lookdown construction, we characterize the distribution of fixation times and the order of allele extinctions in the absence of mutations, and identify a strong stationary time in the presence of mutations. Our results include explicit expressions for the mean fixation and stationary times for the Wright-Fisher diffusion, and mean fixation times in the Beta-coalescent case. A key component of our approach is the analysis of the fixation line introduced by Hénard in (Ann. Appl. Probab., 25:3007-3032, 2015). We extend this process to incorporate mutation, providing a unified framework for studying both fixation and equilibrium behavior.

We prove that there are relative $\mathrm{SO}_0(2,q)$-character varieties of the punctured sphere which are compact, totally non-hyperbolic and contain a dense representation. This work fills a remaining case of the results of N. Tholozan and J. Toulisse. Our approach relies on the non-abelian Hodge correspondence and we study the moduli space of parabolic $\mathrm{SO}_0(2,q)$-Higgs bundles with some fixed weight. Additionally, we provide a construction based on Geometric Invariant Theory (GIT) to demonstrate that the considered moduli spaces can be viewed as a projective variety over $\mathbb{C}$.

We prove that for any possibly-punctured surface with non-empty boundary $\mathbf{\Sigma}=(\Sigma, \mathbb{M}, \mathbb{P})$, and any tagged triangulation $T$ of $\mathbf{\Sigma}$ in the sense of Fomin--Shapiro--Thurston, the coefficient-free bangle functions of Musiker--Schiffler--Williams coincide with the coefficient-free generic Caldero--Chapoton functions arising from the Jacobian algebra of the quiver with potential $(Q(T), W(T))$ associated to $T$ by Cerulli Irelli and the second author.
When the set of boundary marked points $\mathbb{M}$ has at least two elements, Schröer and the first two authors have shown, relying heavily on results of Mills, Muller and Qin, that the generic coefficient-free Caldero-Chapoton functions form a basis of the coefficient-free (upper) cluster algebra $\mathcal{A}(\mathbf{\Sigma})=\mathcal{U}(\mathbf{\Sigma})$. So, the set of bangle functions proposed by Musiker--Schiffler--Williams over ten years ago is indeed a basis.

Backward Reachability Analysis of Perturbed Continuous-Time Linear Systems Using Set Propagation
Mark Wetzlinger, Matthias Althoff
Comments:
16 pages, IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA); Systems and Control (eess.SY)
Backward reachability analysis computes the set of states that reach a target set under the competing influence of control input and disturbances. Depending on their interplay, the backward reachable set either represents all states that can be steered into the target set or all states that cannot avoid entering it -- the corresponding solutions can be used for controller synthesis and safety verification, respectively. A popular technique for backward reachable set computation solves Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equations, which scales exponentially with the state dimension due to gridding the state space. In this work, we instead use set propagation techniques to design backward reachability algorithms for linear time-invariant systems. Crucially, the proposed algorithms scale only polynomially with the state dimension. Our numerical examples demonstrate the tightness of the obtained backward reachable sets and show an overwhelming improvement of our proposed algorithms over state-of-the-art methods regarding scalability, as systems with well over a hundred states can now be analyzed.

We relate the global cohomological properties of the Lefschetz pencil and the monodromy-weight conjecture, in particular we show that if one assumes the monodromy-weight conjecture in smaller dimensions then one can obtain a rather complete understanding of the relative cohomology of the pencil. This reduces the monodromy-weight conjecture to an arithmetic variant of a conjecture of Kashiwara for the projective line.

Let $K$ be a periodic cell complex endowed with a covering $q:K\to G$ where $G$ is a finite quotient space of equivalence classes under translations acting on $K$. We assume $G$ is embedded in a space whose homotopy type is a $d$-torus for some $d$, which introduces "toroidal cycles" in $G$ which do not lift to cycles in $K$ by $q$ . We study the behaviour of toroidal and non-toroidal cycles for the case $K$ is 1-periodic, i.e. $G=K/\mathbb{Z}$ for some free action of $\mathbb{Z}$ on $K$. We show that toroidal cycles can be entirely classified by endomorphisms on the homology of unit cells of $K$, and moreover that toroidal cycles have a sense of unimodality when studying the persistent homology of $G$.

Greedy Newton: Newton's Method with Exact Line Search
Betty Shea, Mark Schmidt
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
{A defining characteristic of Newton's method is local superlinear convergence within a neighbourhood of a strict local minimum. However, outside this neighborhood Newton's method can converge slowly or even diverge. A common approach to dealing with non-convergence is using a step size that is set by an Armijo backtracking line search. With suitable initialization the line-search preserves local superlinear convergence, but may give sub-optimal progress when not near a solution. In this work we consider Newton's method under an exact line search, which we call ``greedy Newton'' (GN). We show that this leads to an improved global convergence rate, while retaining a local superlinear convergence rate. We empirically show that GN may work better than backtracking Newton by allowing significantly larger step sizes.

Korovkin-type approximation for non-positive operators

The classical Korovkin theorem traditionally relies on the positivity of the underlying sequence of operators. However, in 1968, D. E. Wulbert established the first non-positive version. In this article, we generalize Wulbert's result to the class of uniformly bounded sequence of operators. As an application, we obtain an operator version of this Korovkin-type theorem which will cover existing results in this direction. We also present illustrative examples, one of which has its roots in the Grunwald's interpolation operator. In this context, we also present a direct approach with numerical illustrations.

Stochastic optimal control problems with measurable coefficients and $L_d$-drift

The paper is fully rewritten, covering more general settings with merely measurable coefficients, an $L_d$-drift and any dimension $d \geq 2$. Further, it discusses more cost functions and includes a discussion of the semigroup connection
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Probability (math.PR)
We consider controlled stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with measurable coefficients, a uniformly elliptic diffusion coefficient and an $L_d$-drift. No space-regularity will be assumed for the coefficients. In this framework we investigate the relation of value functions, partial differential equations (PDEs) and operator semigroups. First, for a cost with infinite time horizon on a bounded domain, we identify the value function as $L_{d_0}$-viscosity solution to a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation and we establish quantitative regularity estimates. The constant $d_0 \in (d/2, d)$ only depends on the space dimension $d$, the ellipticity constants of the diffusion coefficient and the $L_d$-bound of the drift. To illustrate applications of these results, we provide a uniqueness theorem under an additional assumption on the diffusion coefficient, showing a stochastic representation, and we discuss stability of value functions. Second, we consider a cost with a finite time horizon, terminal and running terms. We show that the value function indexed over the terminal cost is a nonlinear semigroup on $C_b (\mathbb{R}^d)$ and we establish a regularization by noise effect, which shows that the semigroup regularizes lower semicontinuity to local Hölder continuity. Lastly, we relate the semigroup to a parabolic PDE, showing that it is an $L_{d + 1}$-viscosity solution, and we establish local in time and global in space quantitative regularity estimates. Our proofs for the regularity of the value functions, the $C_b$-Feller property of the semigroup and its regularization by noise effects are based on a strong Markov selection principle and analytic estimates for linear diffusions that were recently established by N. V. Krylov in a series of papers. We highlight that our method covers frameworks without uniqueness of the controlled SDEs, as well as the associated PDEs.

We introduce an operator system, universal for the probabilistic models of a contextuality scenario, and identify its maximal C*-cover via the right C*-algebra of a canonical ternary ring of operators, arising from a hypergraph version of stochastic operator matrices. We study dilating contextuality scenarios, which have the property that each positive operator representation thereof admits a dilation to a projective representation on a larger Hilbert space, and characterise them via the equality of the aforementioned universal operator system and the operator system arising from the canonical generators of the respective hypergraph C*-algebra. We characterise the no-signalling probabilistic models over a pair of contextuality scenarios of different types, which arise from either the positive operator representations or from the projective representations of these scenarios, in terms of states on operator system tensor products. Generalising the notion of a synchronous no-signalling correlation to the hypergraph framework, we define coherent probabilistic models associated with a given contextuality scenario and characterise various classes thereof via different types of traces of the hypergraph C*-algebra, associated with the scenario. We establish several equivalent formulations of the Connes Embedding Problem in terms of no-signalling probabilistic models and hypergraph operator systems.

We prove that the capillary energy of any surface supported on any such convex cylinder is strictly larger than that of a spherical cap with the same volume and the same contact angle on a flat support, unless the surface is itself a spherical cap resting on a facet of the cylinder. In this class of convex sets, our result extends for the first time the well-known Choe-Ghomi-Ritoré relative isoperimetric inequality, corresponding to the case $\theta = \pi/2$, to general angles.

We investigate a Dirichlet series involving the Fourier-Jacobi coefficients of two cusp forms $F,G$ for orthogonal groups of signature $(2,n+2)$. In the case when $F$ is a Hecke eigenform and $G$ is a Maass lift of a Poincaré series, we establish a connection with the standard $L$-function attached to $F$. What is more, we find explicit choices of orthogonal groups, for which we obtain a clear-cut Euler product expression for this Dirichlet series. Through our considerations, we recover a classical result for Siegel modular forms, first introduced by Kohnen and Skoruppa, but also provide a range of new examples, which can be related to other kinds of modular forms, such as paramodular, Hermitian, and quaternionic.

The algebra of symmetric tensors $S(X):= H^0(X, \sf{S}^{\bullet} T_X)$ of a projective manifold $X$ leads to a natural dominant affinization morphism $$
\varphi_X: T^*X \longrightarrow \mathcal{Z}_X:= \text{Spec} S(X). $$ It is shown that $\varphi_X$ is birational if and only if $T_X$ is big. We prove that if $\varphi_X$ is birational, then $\mathcal{Z}_X$ is a symplectic variety endowed with the Schouten--Nijenhuis bracket if and only if $\mathbb{P} T_X$ is of Fano type, which is the case for smooth projective toric varieties, smooth horospherical varieties with small boundary and the quintic del Pezzo threefold. These give examples of a distinguished class of conical symplectic varieties, which we call symplectic orbifold cones.

Combinatorial flats and Schubert varieties of subspace arrangements

Comments:
Updated with suggestions from referee, including a new title
Subjects:
Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Combinatorics (math.CO)
The lattice of flats $\mathcal L_M$ of a matroid $M$ is combinatorially well-behaved and, when $M$ is realizable, admits a geometric model in the form of a "Schubert variety of hyperplane arrangement". In contrast, the lattice of flats of a polymatroid exhibits many combinatorial pathologies and admits no similar geometric model.
We address this situation by defining the lattice $\mathcal L_P$ of "combinatorial flats" of a polymatroid $P$. Combinatorially, $\mathcal L_P$ exhibits good behavior analogous to that of $\mathcal L_M$: it is graded, determines $P$ when $P$ is simple, and is top-heavy. When $P$ is realizable over a field of characteristic 0, we show that $\mathcal L_P$ is modeled by "the Schubert variety of a subspace arrangement".
Our work generalizes a number of results of Ardila-Boocher and Huh-Wang on Schubert varieties of hyperplane arrangements; however, the geometry of Schubert varieties of subspace arrangements is noticeably more complicated than that of Schubert varieties of hyperplane arrangements. Many natural questions remain open.

We prove that the rational cohomology ring of moduli space of multiscale differentials in genus 0 is generated by the boundary divisors. The main idea is the technique of the Chow-Künneth generation Property and the observation that the intersection of a collection of boundary divisors in the moduli space is irreducible. We observe that the relations between the boundary strata in cohomology are generated by the pullback of the WDVV relations and the relations between the torus-invariant subvarieties in the fiber over $\overline{M}_{0,n}$. We also characterize the cases in which the moduli space is a smooth variety, and in these cases, we prove that the integral cohomology ring is generated by the boundary divisors.

Gilmer and Masbaum use Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev (WRT) invariants to define a map from the Kauffman bracket skein module to a set of complex-valued functions defined on roots of unity in order to provide a lower bound for its dimension. We compute the image of the evaluation map for a family of mapping tori of the 2-torus and find that the restriction of the map to certain homology classes is not injective. This provides an answer to a question posed by Gilmer and Masbaum in the latter paper. Moreover, we give a basis for the Kauffman bracket skein module in the case of the mapping torus of a power of the Dehn twist along the meridian of the 2-torus.

We present two sharp, closed-form empirical Bernstein inequalities for symmetric random matrices with bounded eigenvalues. By sharp, we mean that both inequalities adapt to the unknown variance in a tight manner: the deviation captured by the first-order $1/\sqrt{n}$ term asymptotically matches the matrix Bernstein inequality exactly, including constants, the latter requiring knowledge of the variance. Our first inequality holds for the sample mean of independent matrices, and our second inequality holds for a mean estimator under martingale dependence at stopping times.

We describe an algorithm to compute the stable multiplicity of a family of irreducible representations in the cohomology of ordered configuration space of the plane. Using this algorithm, we compute the stable multiplicities of all families of irreducibles given by Young diagrams with $23$ boxes or less up to cohomological degree $50$. In particular, this determines the stable cohomology in cohomological degrees $0 \leq i \leq 11$. We prove related qualitative results and formulate some conjectures.

The colored Jones polynomial associated to a knot admits an expansion of knot invariants known as the large-color expansion or Melvin-Morton-Rozansky expansion. We will show how this expansion can be derived from the universal invariant arising from a Hopf algebra $\mathbb{D}$, as introduced by Bar-Natan and Van der Veen. We utilize a Mathematica implementation to compute the universal invariant $\mathbf{Z}_{\mathbb{D}}(\mathcal{K})$ up to a certain order for a given knot $\mathcal{K}$, allowing for experimental verification of our theoretical results.

Lossless Convexification for Linear Systems with Piecewise Linear Controls
Shosuke Kiami
Comments:
8 pages, 5 figures
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
Lossless Convexification (LCvx) is a convexification technique that transforms a class of nonconvex optimal control problems$\unicode{x2013}$where the nonconvexity arises from a lower bound on the control norm$\unicode{x2013}$into equivalent convex problems, with the goal being to apply fast polynomial-time solvers. However, to solve these infinite-dimensional problems in practice, they must first be converted into finite-dimensional problems, and it remains an open challenge to ensure the theoretical guarantees of LCvx are maintained across this discretization step. Prior work has proven guarantees for piecewise constant controls, but these methods do not extend to piecewise linear controls, which are more relevant to real world applications.
In this work, we present an algorithm that extends LCvx guarantees to piecewise linear controls. Under mild assumptions, our algorithm provably finds a solution violating the nonconvex constraints along at most $2n_x + 2$ trajectory "edges" using $O(\log(\Delta\rho/\varepsilon))$ solver calls (where $n_x$ is the state space dimension and $\Delta\rho = \rho_{\max} - \rho_{\min}$ is the difference in our control norm bounds). A key feature is the perturbation of the control norm lower bound and the addition of rate constraints on the controls, ensuring LCvx holds along the trajectory edges. Finally, we provide numerical results demonstrating the effectiveness of our algorithm.

This paper investigates Singer's conjecture by examining the cohit module $\mathbb F_2\otimes_{\mathcal A}P^{\otimes h}$ for specific degrees and values of $h$. Utilizing hit problem techniques, we extend previous work by Mothebe et al. and establish key dimensional results. Notably, for $h\geq 6$, we prove that the cohit module's dimension in certain degrees matches the order of a specific factor group. Our contributions include demonstrating that certain non-zero elements do not belong to the image of the Singer algebraic transfer. All results were verified using the OSCAR computer algebra system.

We classify the shift operators for the symmetric Askey-Wilson polynomials and construct shift operators for the non-symmetric Askey-Wilson polynomials using two decompositions of non-symmetric Askey-Wilson polynomials in terms of symmetric ones. These shift operators are difference-reflection operators, and we discuss the conditions under which they restrict to shift operators for the symmetric Askey-Wilson polynomials. We use them to compute the norms of the non-symmetric Askey-Wilson polynomials and compute their specialisations for $q\to1$. These turn out to be shift operators for the non-symmetric Heckman-Opdam polynomials of type $BC_1$ that have recently been found.

Differentiability of the value function in control-constrained parabolic problems
Alberto Domínguez Corella, Nicolai Jork, Stefan Volkwein
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
Along the optimal trajectory of an optimal control problem constrained by a semilinear parabolic partial differential equation, we prove the differentiability of the value function with respect to the initial condition and, under additional assumptions on the solution of the state equation, the differentiability of the value function with respect to the time variable. In our proof, we rely on local growth assumptions commonly associated with the study of second-order sufficient conditions. These assumptions are generally applicable to a wide range of problems, including, for instance, certain tracking-type problems. Finally, we discuss the differentiability of the value function in a neighborhood of the optimal trajectory when a growth condition for optimal controls is used.

The present paper is a continuation of the study of the interplay between the contact Hamiltonian dynamics and the moduli theory of (perturbed) contact instantons and its applications initiated in [Oh21b, Oh22a]. In this paper we prove Weinstein's conjecture and Arnold's chord conjecture in their full generalities. The two key ingredients lying in the background of our proof of Arnold's chord conjecture are the existence of the fundamental class of the Legendrian contact instanton cohomology modulo bubbling-off, and the evaluation transversality of the moduli space of contact instantons against the level set of conformal exponent function. Our proof of Weinstein's conjecture also utilizes the existence scheme of translated points of a contactomorphism developed in [Oh22a], especially associated to a contact Hamiltonian loop, via the geometric construction of the Legendrianization of contactomorphisms of $(Q,\lambda)$ in the contact product $M_Q = Q \times Q \times \mathbb R$ and its usage of the $\mathbb Z_2$ anti-contact involutive symmetry.

Edit distance in substitution systems

Let $\sigma$ be a primitive substitution on an alphabet $\mathcal{A}$, and let $\mathcal{W}_n$ be the set of words of length $n$ determined by $\sigma$ (i.e., $w \in \mathcal{W}_n$ if $w$ is a subword of $\sigma^k(a)$ for some $a \in \mathcal{A}$ and $k \geq 1$). It is known that the corresponding substitution dynamical system is loosely Kronecker (also known as zero-entropy loosely Bernoulli), so the diameter of $\mathcal{W}_n$ in the edit distance is $o(n)$. We improve this upper bound to $O(n/\sqrt{\log n})$. The main challenge is handling the case where $\sigma$ is non-uniform; a better bound is available for the uniform case. Finally, we show that for the Thue--Morse substitution, the diameter of $\mathcal{W}_n$ is at least $\sqrt {n/6} - 1$.

Dirichlet's Lemma states that every primitive quadratic Dirichlet character $\chi$ can be written in the form $\chi(n) = (\frac{\Delta}n)$ for a suitable quadratic discriminant $\Delta$. In this article we define a group, the separant class group, that measures the extent to which Dirichlet's Lemma fails in general number fields $F$. As an application we will show that over fields with trivial separant class groups, genus theory of quadratic extensions can be made as explicit as over the rationals.

Minimal codes from hypersurfaces in even characteristic
Angela Aguglia, Luca Giuzzi, Giovanni Longobardi, Viola Siconolfi
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
The setting of projective systems can be used to study the parameters of a projective linear code $\mathcal{C}$. This can be done by considering the intersections of the point set $\Omega$ defined by the columns of a generating matrix for $\mathcal{C}$ with the hyperplanes of a projective space. In particular, $\mathcal{C}$ is minimal if $\Omega$ is cutting, i.e., every hyperplane is spanned by its intersection with $\Omega$. Minimal linear codes have important applications for secret sharing schemes and secure two-party computation. In this article we first investigate the properties of some algebraic hypersurfaces $\mathcal{V}_{\varepsilon}^r$ related to certain quasi-Hermitian varieties of $\mathrm{PG}(r,q^2)$, with $q=2^e$, $e>1$ odd. These varieties give rise to a new infinite family of linear codes which are minimal except for $r=3$ and $e\equiv 1 \pmod 4$. In the case $r \in \{3,4\}$, we exhibit codes having at most 6 non-zero weights whose we provide the complete list. As a byproduct, we obtain $(r+1)$-dimensional codes with just $3$ non-zero weights. We point out that linear codes with few weights are also important in authentication codes and association schemes. In the last part of the paper we consider an extension of the notion of being cutting with respect to subspaces other than hyperplanes and introduce the definition of cutting gap in order to characterize and measure what happens when this property is not satisfied. Finally, we then apply these notions to Hermitian codes and to the codes related to $\mathcal{V}_\varepsilon^r$ discussed before.

We consider the set ${\mathscr S}_Q$ of Farey fractions $d/b$ of order $Q$ with the property that there exists a matrix $\left( \begin{smallmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{smallmatrix} \right) \in \operatorname{SL}(2,{\mathbb Z})$ of trace at most $Q$, with positive entries and $a\ge \max\{ b,c\}$. For every $Q\ge 3$, the set ${\mathscr S}_Q \cup \{ 0\}$ is shown to define a unimodular partition of the interval $[0,1]$. We also prove that the elements of ${\mathscr S}_Q$ are asymptotically distributed with respect to the probability measure with density $(1/(1+x) -1/(2+x) )/\log (4/3) $ and that the sequence of sets $({\mathscr S}_Q)_Q$ has a limiting gap distribution as $Q\rightarrow \infty$.

Hybrid Schwarz preconditioners for linear systems arising from hp-discontinuous Galerkin method
Vit Dolejsi, Tomas Hammerbauer
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
We deal with the numerical solution of linear elliptic problems with varying diffusion coefficient by the $hp$-discontinuous Galerkin method. We develop a two-level hybrid Schwarz preconditioner for the arising linear algebraic systems. The preconditioner is additive with respect to the local components and multiplicative with respect to the mesh levels. We derive the $hp$ spectral bound of the preconditioned operator in the form $O((H/h)(p^2/q))$, where $H$ and $h$ are the element sizes of the coarse and fine meshes, respectively, and $p$ and $q$ are the polynomial approximation degrees on the fine and coarse meshes. Further, we present a numerical study comparing the hybrid Schwarz preconditioner with the standard additive one from the point of view of the speed of convergence and also computational costs. Moreover, we investigate the convergence of both techniques with respect to the diffusivity variation and to the domain decomposition (non-)respecting the material interfaces. Finally, the combination with a $hp$-mesh adaptation for the solution of nonlinear problem demonstrates the potential of this approach.

Trace Ratio vs Ratio Trace Methods for Multidimensional Dimensionality Reduction
Alaeddine Zahir, Franck Dufrenois, Khalide Jbilou, Ahmed Ratnani
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
We propose a higher-order dimensionality reduction framework based on the Trace Ratio (TR) optimization problem. We establish conditions for existence and uniqueness of solutions and clarify the theoretical connection between the Trace Ratio and its surrogate, the Ratio Trace (RT) formulation. Building on these foundations, we design a Newton-type iterative algorithm that operates directly in the tensor domain via the Einstein product, avoiding data flattening and preserving multi-dimensional structure.
This approach extends classical Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to higher-order tensors, offering a natural generalization of trace-based dimensionality reduction from matrices to tensors. Numerical experiments on several benchmark datasets confirm the efficiency and robustness of the proposed methods, showing consistent improvements over existing matrix- and tensor-based techniques.

We continue and generalise our earlier investigations of the number of squares in binary recurrence sequences. Here we consider sequences, $\left( y_{k} \right)_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}$, arising from the solutions of generalised negative Pell equations, $X^{2}-dY^{2}=c$, where $-c$ and $y_{0}$ are any positive squares. We show that there are at most $2$ distinct squares larger than an explicit lower bound in such sequences. From this result, we also show that there are at most $5$ distinct squares when $y_{0}=b^{2}$ for infinitely many values of $b$, including all $1 \leq b \leq 24$, as well as once $d$ exceeds an explicit lower bound, without any conditions on the size of such squares.

We develop two complementary generative mechanisms that explain when and why Benford's first-digit law arises. First, a probabilistic Turing machine (PTM) ensemble induces a geometric law for code length. Maximizing its entropy under a constraint on halting length yields Benford statistics. This model shows a phase transition with respect to the halt probability. Second, a constrained partition model (Einstein-solid combinatorics) recovers the same logarithmic profile as the maximum-entropy solution under a coarse-grained entropy-rate constraint, clarifying the role of non-ergodicity (ensemble vs.\ trajectory averages). We also perform numerical experiments that corroborate our conclusions.

A notion of fractality for a class of states and noncommutative relative distance zeta functional

In this work, we first recall the definition of the relative distance zeta function in [42, 43, 44, 46, 47] and slightly generalize this notion from sets to probability measures, and then move on to propose a novel definition a relative distance (and tube) zeta functional for a class of states over a C* algebra. With such an extension, we look into the chance to define relative Minkowski dimensions in this context, and explore the notion of fractality for this class of states. Relative complex dimensions as poles of this newly proposed relative distance zeta functional, as well as its geometric and transformation properties, decomposition rules and properties that respects tensor products are discussed. We then explore some examples that possess fractal properties with this new zeta functional and propose functional equations similar to [11,35,36,42].

Nonlinear bound states with prescribed angular momentum in the mass supercritical regime

Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
In this paper, we consider the existence, orbital stability/instability and regularity of bound state solutions to nonlinear Schrödinger equations with super-quadratic confinement in two and three spatial dimensions for the mass supercritical case. Such solutions, which are given by time-dependent rotations of a non-radially symmetric spatial profile, correspond to critical points of the underlying energy function restricted on the double constraints consisting of the mass and the angular momentum. The study exhibits new pictures for rotating Bose-Einstein condensates within the framework of Gross-Pitaevskii theory. It is proved that there exist two non-radial symmetric solutions, one of which is local minimizer and the other is mountain pass type critical point of the underlying energy function restricted on the constraints. Moreover, we derive conditions that guarantee that local minimizers are regular, the set of those is orbitally stable and mountain pass type solutions are strongly unstable. The results extend and complement the recent ones in \cite{NSS}, where the consideration is undertaken in the mass subcritical case.

By means of the three-field Hu-Washizu principle, introducing the displacement gradient and 1st Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor as additional fields, we circumvent the inversion of the constitutive law. We lift the arising distributional derivatives of the displacement gradient to a regular auxiliary displacement gradient field. Static condensation can be applied at the element level, providing a global pure displacement problem to be solved. We present a stabilization motivated by Hybrid Discontinuous Galerkin methods. A solving algorithm is discussed, which asserts the solvability of the arising linearized subproblems for problems with physically positive eigenvalues. The excellent performance of the proposed method is corroborated by several numerical experiments.

A Two-Level Direct Solver for the Hierarchical Poincaré-Steklov Method

Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
We introduce a two-level direct solver for the Hierarchical Poincaré-Steklov (HPS) method for solving linear elliptic PDEs. HPS combines multidomain spectral collocation with a direct solver, enabling high-order discretizations for highly oscillatory solutions while preserving computational efficiency. Our method employs batched linear algebra routines with GPU acceleration to reduce the problem to subdomain interfaces, yielding a block-sparse linear system. This system is then factorized using a sparse direct solver that employs pivoting to achieve better numerical stability than the original HPS scheme. For a discretization of local order $p$ involving a total of $N$ degrees of freedom, the initial reduction step has asymptotic complexity $O(N p^6)$ in three dimensions. Nevertheless, the high efficiency of batched GPU routines makes the overall cost for practical purposes independent of polynomial order (for order $p=20$ or even higher). Additionally, the cost of the sparse direct solver is independent of the polynomial order. We present a description and justification of our method, along with numerical experiments on three-dimensional problems to evaluate its accuracy and performance.

The dual challenges of prohibitive communication overhead and the impracticality of gradient computation due to data privacy or black-box constraints in distributed systems motivate this work on communication-constrained gradient-free optimization. We propose a stochastic distributed zeroth-order algorithm (Com-DSZO) requiring only two function evaluations per iteration, integrated with general compression operators. Rigorous analysis establishes its sublinear convergence rate for both smooth and nonsmooth objectives, while explicitly elucidating the compression-convergence trade-off. Furthermore, we develop a variance-reduced variant (VR-Com-DSZO) under stochastic mini-batch feedback. The empirical algorithm performance are illustrated with numerical examples.

Tangentads: a formal approach to tangent categories
Marcello Lanfranchi
Subjects:
Category Theory (math.CT)
Tangent category theory is a well-established categorical context for differential geometry. In a previous paper, a formal approach was adopted to provide a genuine Grothendieck construction in the context of tangent categories by introducing tangentads. A tangentad is to a tangent category as a formal monad is to a monad of a category. In this paper, we discuss the formal notion of tangentads, construct a $2$-comonad structure on the $2$-functor of tangentads, and introduce Cartesian, adjunctable, and representable tangentads. We also reinterpret the subtangent structure with negatives of a tangent structure as a right Kan extension. Furthermore, we present numerous examples of tangentads, such as tangent (split) restriction categories, tangent fibrations, tangent monads, display tangent categories, and infinitesimal objects. Finally, we employ the formal approach to prove that every tangent monad admits the construction of algebras, provided the underlying monad does, and show that tangent split restriction categories are $2$-equivalent to tangent $\mathscr{M}$-categories.

We adopt the Koch-Tataru theory for the Navier-Stokes equations, based on Carleson measure estimates, to develop a scaling-critical low-regularity framework for half-harmonic map heat flows. This nonlocal variant of the harmonic map heat flow has been studied recently in connection with free boundary minimal surfaces. We introduce a new class of initial data for the flow, broader than the conventional energy or Sobolev spaces considered in previous work, for which we establish existence, uniqueness, and continuous dependence. The class particularly includes homogeneous initial data that give rise to self-similar expanders.

We introduce a cohomological method to compute Cox rings of hypersurfaces in the ambient space P^1 x P^n, which is more direct than existing methods. We prove that smooth hypersurfaces defined by regular sequences of coefficients are Mori dream spaces, generalizing a result of Ottem. We also compute Cox rings of certain specialized examples. In particular, we compute Cox rings in the well-studied family of Calabi--Yau threefolds of bidegree (2,4) in P^1 x P^3, determining explicitly how the Cox ring can jump discontinuously in a smooth family.

Subjects:

We present a numerical framework for solving neural field equations on surfaces using Radial Basis Function (RBF) interpolation and quadrature. Neural field models describe the evolution of macroscopic brain activity, but modeling studies often overlook the complex geometry of curved cortical domains. Traditional numerical methods, such as finite element or spectral methods, can be computationally expensive and challenging to implement on irregular domains. In contrast, RBF-based methods provide a flexible alternative by offering interpolation and quadrature schemes that efficiently handle arbitrary geometries with high-order accuracy. We first develop an RBF-based interpolatory projection framework for neural field models on general surfaces. Quadrature for both flat and curved domains are derived in detail, ensuring high-order accuracy and stability as they depend on RBF hyperparameters (basis functions, augmenting polynomials, and stencil size). Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the convergence of our method, highlighting its advantages over traditional approaches in terms of flexibility and accuracy. We conclude with an exposition of numerical simulations of spatiotemporal activity on complex surfaces, illustrating the method's ability to capture complex wave propagation patterns.

Comments:

Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
Using connections to random matrix theory and orthogonal polynomials, we develop a framework for obtaining explicit closed-form formulae for the number, $\mathscr{N}_{g}(2\nu,j)$, of connected $2\nu$-valent labeled graphs with $j$ vertices that can be embedded on a compact Riemann surface of minimal genus $g$. We also derive formulae for their two-legged counterparts $\mathcal{N}_{g}(2\nu,j)$. Our method recovers the known explicit results for graphs embedded on the plane and the torus, and extends them to all genera $g \geq 2$. In earlier work, Ercolani, Lega, and Tippings (2023) showed that $\mathscr{N}_{g}(2\nu,j)$ and $\mathcal{N}_{g}(2\nu,j)$ admit structural expressions as linear combinations of, respectively, $3g-2$ and $3g$ Gauss hypergeometric functions ${}_2F_1$, but with coefficients left undetermined. The framework developed here provides a systematic procedure to compute these coefficients, thereby turning the structural expressions into fully explicit formulae for $\mathscr{N}_{g}(2\nu,j)$ and $\mathcal{N}_{g}(2\nu,j)$ as functions of both $j$ and $\nu$. Detailed results are given for $g=2,3,$ and $4$, and the framework extends naturally to all $g \geq 5$ with increasing computational effort. This closes the fixed genus combinatorics for even-valent graphs.

In this note, we investigate the analog problem for $k$-spaces over the field with $q$ elements. For $s \geq k+1$, we show that the largest $s$-sunflower-free family $\mathcal{F}$ satisfies
\[
1 \leq |\mathcal{F}| / q^{(s-1) \binom{k+1}{2} - k} \leq (q/(q-1))^k.
\] For $s \leq k$, we show that
\[
q^{-\binom{k+1}{2}} \leq |\mathcal{F}| / q^{(s-1) \binom{k+1}{2} - k} \leq (q/(q-1))^k.
\] Our lower bounds rely on an iterative construction that uses lifted maximum rank-distance (MRD) codes.

Title:
Rough Burger-like SPDEs

Subjects:
Probability (math.PR); Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
By applying the theory of rough paths, Martin Hairer provided a notion of solution for a class of nonlinear stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) of Burgers type, driven by additive space-time white noise in one spatial dimension. These equations exhibit spatial roughness that is too severe for classical analytical techniques to handle. Hairer developed a pathwise framework for solutions when the spatial regularity of the solution lies in the range $(\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{2})$. In this paper, we generalize Hairer's result by extending the spatial regularity to the range $(0, 1]$. More precisely, we establish the pathwise existence and uniqueness of mild (and, equivalently, weak) solutions to Burgers-type SPDEs under this spatial regularity regime.

Quasimodularity and Limiting Behavior for Variations of MacMahon Series

Subjects:
Number Theory (math.NT)
Motivated by the 1920's seminal work of Major MacMahon, Amdeberhan--Andrews--Tauraso recently introduced an infinite family of $q$-series \[
\mathcal{U}_{t}(a;q):= \sum_{1\le n_1<n_2<\cdots<n_t} \frac{q^{n_1+n_2+\cdots+n_t}}{(1+aq^{n_1}+q^{2n_1})(1+aq^{n_2}+q^{2n_2})\cdots (1+aq^{n_t}+q^{2n_t})} \] and proved that these functions are linear combinations of quasimodular forms. In this paper, we study a broader family of $q$-series that contains the collection $\{\mathcal{U}_t\}_{t \in \mathbb{N}}$. Using the theory of quasi shuffle algebras, we show that this extended family also lies in the algebra of quasimodular forms. Moreover, we determine the precise weights and levels of these functions, thereby making Amdeberhan--Andrews--Tauraso's result sharp. We further investigate the limiting behavior of these functions. In particular, we demonstrate that the sequence of quasimodular forms~$\{\mathcal{U}_t(1;q)\}_{t\in\mathbb{N}}$ gives an approximation for the ordinary partition function. We also establish infinitely many closed formulas for reciprocals of certain infinite products in terms of~$\mathcal{U}_{t}(a;q)$.

Hamiltonian Descent Algorithms for Optimization: Accelerated Rates via Randomized Integration Time
Qiang Fu, Andre Wibisono
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC); Machine Learning (cs.LG); Machine Learning (stat.ML)
We study the Hamiltonian flow for optimization (HF-opt), which simulates the Hamiltonian dynamics for some integration time and resets the velocity to $0$ to decrease the objective function; this is the optimization analogue of the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm for sampling. For short integration time, HF-opt has the same convergence rates as gradient descent for minimizing strongly and weakly convex functions. We show that by randomizing the integration time in HF-opt, the resulting randomized Hamiltonian flow (RHF) achieves accelerated convergence rates in continuous time, similar to the rates for the accelerated gradient flow. We study a discrete-time implementation of RHF as the randomized Hamiltonian gradient descent (RHGD) algorithm. We prove that RHGD achieves the same accelerated convergence rates as Nesterov's accelerated gradient descent (AGD) for minimizing smooth strongly and weakly convex functions. We provide numerical experiments to demonstrate that RHGD is competitive with classical accelerated methods such as AGD across all settings and outperforms them in certain regimes.

Title:
Sharp Asymptotic Minimaxity for One-Group Priors in Sparse Normal Means Problem
Sayantan Paul, Prasenjit Ghosh, Arijit Chakrabarti
Subjects:
Statistics Theory (math.ST)
In this paper, we consider the asymptotic properties of the Bayesian multiple testing rules when the mean parameter of the sparse normal means problem is modeled by a broad class of global-local priors, expressed as a scale mixture of normals. We are interested in studying the least possible risk, i.e., the minimax risk for two frequentist losses, one being the usual misclassification (or Hamming) loss, and the other one, measured as the sum of FDR and FNR. Under the betamin separation condition, at first, assuming the level of sparsity to be known, we propose a condition on the global parameter of our chosen class of priors, such that the resultant decision rule attains the minimax risk for both of the losses mentioned above. When the level of sparsity is unknown, we either use an estimate of the global parameter obtained from the data, or propose an absolutely continuous prior on it. For both of the procedures, under some assumption on the unknown level of sparsity, we show that the decision rules also attain the minimax risk, again for both of the losses. Our results also provide a guideline regarding the selection of priors, in the sense that beyond a subclass(horseshoe type priors) of our chosen class of priors, the minimax risk is not achievable with respect to any one of the two loss functions considered in this article. However, the subclass, horseshoe-type priors, is such a large subclass that it contains Horseshoe, Strawderman Berger, standard double Pareto, inverse gamma priors, just to name a few. In this way, along with the most popular BH procedure and approach using spike and slab prior, a multiple testing rule based on one group priors also achieves the optimal boundary. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first results in the literature of global local priors which ensure the optimal minimax risk can be achieved exactly.

A deep solver for backward stochastic Volterra integral equations

We present the first deep-learning solver for backward stochastic Volterra integral equations (BSVIEs) and their fully-coupled forward-backward variants. The method trains a neural network to approximate the two solution fields in a single stage, avoiding the use of nested time-stepping cycles that limit classical algorithms. For the decoupled case we prove a non-asymptotic error bound composed of an a posteriori residual plus the familiar square root dependence on the time step. Numerical experiments confirm this rate and reveal two key properties: \emph{scalability}, in the sense that accuracy remains stable from low dimension up to 500 spatial variables while GPU batching keeps wall-clock time nearly constant; and \emph{generality}, since the same method handles coupled systems whose forward dynamics depend on the backward solution. These results open practical access to a family of high-dimensional, path-dependent problems in stochastic control and quantitative finance.

Let $G$ be a locally compact group, $L(G)$ be its group von Neumann algebra equipped with the Plancherel weight $\varphi_G$. In this paper, we consider the following two questions. (1) When is the restriction of $\varphi_G$ to the subalgebra generated by a closed subgroup $H$ semifinite? If so, is it equal (up to a constant) to $\varphi_H$? (2) When is $L(G)$ a factor? We give a complete answer to (1), and when $G$ is second countable, $G_1 := \text{ker}\Delta_G$ is open in $G$ (called almost unimodular) and admits a sufficiently large non-unimodular part, we provide an answer to (2). When $L(G)$ is a factor, we also provide the formula of the S-invariant of $L(G)$.

Thermodynamical aspects of fermions in external electromagnetic fields

Comments:

Subjects:
Mathematical Physics (math-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
The thermodynamics of Dirac fields under the influence of external electromagnetic fields is studied. For perturbations which act only for finite time, the influence of the perturbation can be described by an automorphism which can be unitarily implemented in the GNS representations of KMS states, a result long known for the Fock representation. For time-independent perturbations, however, the time evolution cannot be implemented in typical cases, so the standard methods of quantum statistical mechanics do not apply. Instead we show that a smooth switching on of the external potential allows a comparison of the free and the perturbed time evolution, and approach to equilibrium, a possible existence of non-equilibrium stationary states (NESS) and Araki's relative entropy can be investigated. As a byproduct, we find an explicit formula for the relative entropy of gauge invariant quasi-free states.

We show that a smooth $d$-manifold $M$ is diffeomorphic to $\mathbb R^d$ if it admits a Lyapunov-Reeb function, i.e., a smooth map $f:M\to\mathbb R$ that is proper, lower-bounded, and has a unique critical point. By constructing such functions, we prove that the moduli spaces of self-avoiding polygonal linkages and configurations are diffeomorphic to Euclidean spaces. This resolves the Refined Carpenter's Rule Problem and confirms a conjecture proposed by González and Sedano-Mendoza. Furthermore, we describe foliation structures of these moduli spaces via level sets of Lyapunov-Reeb functions and develop algorithms for related problems.

Algebroid Mappings and Their Equidistribution Theory
Xianjing Dong
Comments:

Subjects:
Complex Variables (math.CV)
In this paper, the concept of algebroid mappings of complex manifolds is introduced based on that a large number of complex systems of PDEs admit multi-valued solutions that can be defined by a system of independent algebraic equations over the field of meromorphic functions. It is well-known that Nevanlinna theory is an important tool in complex ODE theory. To develop a similar tool applied to the study of algebroid solutions of complex systems of PDEs, one explores the equidistribution theory of algebroid mappings. Via uniformizating an algebroid mapping, we obtain a second main theorem of algebroid mappings from a complete Kähler manifold into a complex projective manifold provided that some certain conditions are imposed.

In this paper, we introduce a necessary condition for the existence of characteristic zero liftings of certain smooth, proper varieties in positive characteristic, using etale homotopy theory and Wall's finiteness obstruction. For a variety with finite etale fundamental group pi, we define a notion of mod-l finite dominatedness based on the F_l-chain complex of the universal cover of its l-profinite etale homotopy type. We prove that such a variety X can be lifted to characteristic zero only if the above chain complex of X is quasi-isomorphic to a bounded complex of finitely generated projective F_l[pi]-modules. To prove this result, we extend Wall's discussions of finiteness obstructions to l-profinite complete spaces with finite fundamental group.

This survey synthesizes the principal descriptive set-theoretic perspectives on deterministic Cantor sets on the real line and charts directions for future study. After recounting their historical genesis and compiling an up-to-date taxonomy, we review the Borel hierarchy and four hierarchically ordered representations-general, nested, iterated-function-system (IFS), and q-ary expansion-presented from the most general to the most specific set-theoretic description of deterministic Cantor sets. We then present explicit and recursive descriptions for two thin families of measure-zero Cantor sets and an augmented "tick" family of positive measure, respectively, showing that the classical middle-third set lies in the intersection of all three families of after-mentioned Cantor sets. The survey closes by isolating several open problems in four directions, aiming to provide mathematicians with a coherent platform for further descriptive set-theoretic investigations into Cantor-type sets on the real line.

Counting edges of different types in a local graph of a Grassmann graph
Ian Seong
Comments:
22 pages, 3 figures
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
Let $\mathbb{F}_q$ denote a finite field with $q$ elements. Let $n,k$ denote integers with $n>2k\geq 6$. Let $V$ denote a vector space over $\mathbb{F}_{q}$ that has dimension $n$. The vertex set of the Grassmann graph $J_q(n,k)$ consists of the $k$-dimensional subspaces of $V$. Two vertices of $J_q(n,k)$ are adjacent whenever their intersection has dimension $k-1$. Let $\partial$ denote the path-length distance function of $J_q(n,k)$. Pick a vertex $y$. In this paper we define three types of edges in $X$, namely type $0$, type $+$, and type $-$; for adjacent vertices $w,z$ such that $\partial(w,y)=\partial(z,y)$, the type of the edge $wz$ depends on the subspaces $w+z,w,z,w\cap z$ and their intersections with $y$. Pick a vertex $x$ such that $1<\partial(x,y)<k$. Let $\Gamma(x)$ denote the local graph of $x$ in $J_q(n,k)$. Our general goal is to count the number of edges in $\Gamma(x)$ for each type. Consider a two-vertex stabilizer $\text{Stab}(x,y)$ in $GL(V)$; it is known that the $\text{Stab}(x,y)$-action on $\Gamma(x)$ has five orbits. Pick two orbits $\mathcal{O},\mathcal{N}$ that are not necessarily distinct; for a given $w\in \mathcal{O}$, we find the number of vertices in $z\in \mathcal{N}$ such that the edge $wz$ has (i) type $0$, (ii) type $+$, (iii) type $-$. To find these numbers, we use many results that involve a projective geometry $P_q(n)$, which is the set of all subspaces of $V$.

The results rely on classical oscillation criteria for difference equations and exploit the hybrid nature of these equations, connecting them to the theory of advanced and delayed difference equations.

Representation theory for polymatroids
Matthew Baker, June Huh, Donggyu Kim, Mario Kummer, Oliver Lorscheid
Comments:
90 pages
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
We develop a theory of representations of (discrete) polymatroids over tracts in terms of Plücker coordinates and suitable Plücker relations. As special cases, we recover polymatroids themselves as polymatroid representations over the Krasner hyperfield K and M-convex functions as polymatroid representations over the tropical hyperfield.
We introduce and study several useful operations for polymatroid representations, such as translation and refined notions of minors and duality which have better properties than the existing definitions; for example, deletion and contraction become dual operations (up to translation) in our setting. We also prove an idempotency principle which asserts that polymatroids which are not translates of matroids are representable only over tracts that are idempotent in a certain specific sense (in particular -1 = 1).
The space of all representations of a polymatroid J, which we call the thin Schubert cell of J, is represented by an algebraic object called {universal tract of J. When we restrict to just the 3-term Plücker relations, we obtain the weak thin Schubert cell, and passing to torus orbits yields the realization space. These are represented by the universal pasture and the foundation of J, respectively. We exhibit a canonical bijection between the universal tract and the universal pasture, which is new even in the case of matroids, and we show that the foundation of a polymatroid is generated by cross ratios. We also describe a (possibly incomplete) list of multiplicative relations between cross ratios.
Thin Schubert cells and realization spaces are canonically embedded in certain tori. Over idempotent tracts, we show that thin Schubert cells contain a canonical torus orbit and split naturally as a product of the realization space with this distinguished torus.

Quantum ergodicity for contact metric structures
Lino Benedetto
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Spectral Theory (math.SP)
This paper is dedicated to the proof of a Quantum Ergodicity (QE) theorem for the eigenfunctions of subLaplacians on contact metric manifolds, under the assumption that the Reeb flow is ergodic. To do so, we rely on a semiclassical pseudodifferential calculus developed for general filtered manifolds that we specialize to the setting of contact manifolds. Our strategy is then reminiscent of an implementation of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation as we rely on the construction of microlocal projectors in our calculus which commute with the subLaplacian, called Landau projectors. The subLaplacian is then shown to act effectively on the range of each Landau projector as the Reeb vector field does. The remainder of the proof follows the classical path towards QE, once microlocal Weyl laws have been established.

Microlocal analysis of non-linear operators arising in Compton CT

Comments:
27 pages, 8 figures
Subjects:
Functional Analysis (math.FA)
We present a novel microlocal analysis of a non-linear ray transform, $\mathcal{R}$, arising in Compton Scattering Tomography (CST). Due to attenuation effects in CST, the integral weights depend on the reconstruction target, $f$, which has singularities. Thus, standard linear Fourier Integral Operator (FIO) theory does not apply as the weights are non-smooth. The V-line (or broken ray) transform, $\mathcal{V}$, can be used to model the attenuation of incoming and outgoing rays. Through novel analysis of $\mathcal{V}$, we characterize the location and strength of the singularities of the ray transform weights. In conjunction, we provide new results which quantify the strength of the singularities of distributional products based on the Sobolev order of the individual components. By combining this new theory, our analysis of $\mathcal{V}$, and classical linear FIO theory, we determine the Sobolev order of the singularities of $\mathcal{R}f$. The strongest (lowest Sobolev order) singularities of $\mathcal{R}f$ are shown to correspond to the wavefront set elements of the classical Radon transform applied to $f$, and we use this idea and known results on the Radon transform to prove injectivity results for $\mathcal{R}$. In addition, we present novel reconstruction methods based on our theory, and we validate our results using simulated image reconstructions.

Grassmann cactus variety is a common generalisation of Grassmann secant variety and cactus variety. In their definitions one considers the vector spaces of fixed dimension that are contained in the linear span of some finite schemes. We prove that to characterise Grassmann cactus varieties it is enough to use finite schemes that locally have low socle dimension. This motivates the study of parameter spaces of such schemes and simplifies calculations of examples of Grassmann cactus varieties.

We consider hyperbolic systems of conservation laws in one spatial dimension. For any limit of front tracking solutions $v$, and for a general weak solution $u\in L^\infty$ with no BV assumption, we prove the following Hölder-type stability estimate in $L^2$:
$$||u(\cdot,\tau)-v(\cdot,\tau)||_{L^2} \leq K \sqrt{||u( \cdot,0)-v( \cdot,0)||_{L^2}}$$
for all $\tau$ without smallness and for a universal constant $K$. Our result holds for all limits of front tracking solutions $v$ with BV bound, either for general systems with small-BV data, or for special systems (isothermal Euler, Temple-class systems) with large-BV data. Our results apply to physical systems such as isentropic Euler. The stability estimate is completely independent of the BV norm of the potentially very wild solution $u$. We use the $L^2$ theory of shock stability modulo an artificial shift of position (Vasseur [Handbook of Differential Equations: Evolutionary Equations, 4:323 -- 376, 2008]) but our stability results do not depend on an artificial shift. Moreover, we give the first result within this framework which can show uniqueness of some solutions with large $L^\infty$ and infinite BV initial data. We apply these techniques to isothermal Euler.

Provable Non-Convex Euclidean Distance Matrix Completion: Geometry, Reconstruction, and Robustness

The problem of recovering the configuration of points from their partial pairwise distances, referred to as the Euclidean Distance Matrix Completion (EDMC) problem, arises in a broad range of applications, including sensor network localization, molecular conformation, and manifold learning. In this paper, we propose a Riemannian optimization framework for solving the EDMC problem by formulating it as a low-rank matrix completion task over the space of positive semi-definite Gram matrices. The available distance measurements are encoded as expansion coefficients in a non-orthogonal basis, and optimization over the Gram matrix implicitly enforces geometric consistency through nonnegativity and the triangle inequality, a structure inherited from classical multidimensional scaling. Under a Bernoulli sampling model for observed distances, we prove that Riemannian gradient descent on the manifold of rank-$r$ matrices locally converges linearly with high probability when the sampling probability satisfies $p\geq O(\nu^2 r^2\log(n)/n)$, where $\nu$ is an EDMC-specific incoherence parameter. Furthermore, we provide an initialization candidate using a one-step hard thresholding procedure that yields convergence, provided the sampling probability satisfies $p \geq O(\nu r^{3/2}\log^{3/4}(n)/n^{1/4})$. A key technical contribution of this work is the analysis of a symmetric linear operator arising from a dual basis expansion in the non-orthogonal basis, which requires a novel application of the Hanson-Wright inequality to establish an optimal restricted isometry property in the presence of coupled terms. Empirical evaluations on synthetic data demonstrate that our algorithm achieves competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we provide a geometric interpretation of matrix incoherence tailored to the EDMC setting and provide robustness guarantees for our method.

Lorentzian polynomials and matroids over triangular hyperfields 1: Topological aspects
Matthew Baker, June Huh, Mario Kummer, Oliver Lorscheid
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO); Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)
Lorentzian polynomials serve as a bridge between continuous and discrete convexity, connecting analysis and combinatorics. In this article, we study the topology of the space $\mathbb{P}\textrm{L}_J$ of Lorentzian polynomials on $J$ modulo $\mathbb{R}_{>0}$, which is nonempty if and only if $J$ is the set of bases of a polymatroid. We prove that $\mathbb{P}\textrm{L}_J$ is a manifold with boundary of dimension equal to the Tutte rank of $J$, and more precisely, that it is homeomorphic to a closed Euclidean ball with the Dressian of $J$ removed from its boundary. Furthermore, we show that $\mathbb{P}\textrm{L}_J$ is homeomorphic to the thin Schubert cell $\textrm{Gr}_J(\mathbb{T}_q)$ of $J$ over the triangular hyperfield $\mathbb{T}_q$, introduced by Viro in the context of tropical geometry and Maslov dequantization, for any $q>0$. This identification enables us to apply the representation theory of polymatroids developed in a companion paper, as well as earlier work by the first and fourth authors on foundations of matroids, to give a simple explicit description of $\mathbb{P}\textrm{L}_J$ up to homeomorphism in several key cases. Our results show that $\mathbb{P}\textrm{L}_J$ always admits a compactification homeomorphic to a closed Euclidean ball. They can also be used to answer a question of Brändén in the negative by showing that the closure of $\mathbb{P}\textrm{L}_J$ within the space of all polynomials modulo $\mathbb{R}_{>0}$ is not homeomorphic to a closed Euclidean ball in general. In addition, we introduce the Hausdorff compactification of the space of rescaling classes of Lorentzian polynomials and show that the Chow quotient of a complex Grassmannian maps naturally to this compactification. This provides a geometric framework that connects the asymptotic structure of the space of Lorentzian polynomials with classical constructions in algebraic geometry.

Title:
Parameter Estimation for Weakly Interacting Hypoelliptic Diffusions
Yuga Iguchi, Alexandros Beskos, Grigorios A. Pavliotis
Subjects:
Statistics Theory (math.ST)
We study parameter estimation for interacting particle systems (IPSs) consisting of $N$ weakly interacting multivariate hypoelliptic SDEs. We propose a locally Gaussian approximation of the transition dynamics, carefully designed to address the degenerate structure of the noise (diffusion matrix), thus leading to the formation of a well-defined full likelihood. Our approach permits carrying out statistical inference for a wide class of hypoelliptic IPSs that are not covered by recent works as the latter rely on the Euler-Maruyama scheme. We analyze a contrast estimator based on the developed likelihood with $n$ high-frequency particle observations over a fixed period $[0,T]$ and show its asymptotic normality as $n, N \to \infty$ with a requirement that the step-size $\Delta_n = T/n$ is such that $N\Delta_n\rightarrow 0$, assuming that all particle coordinates (e.g.~position and velocity) are observed. In practical situations where only partial observations (e.g. particle positions but not velocities) are available, the proposed locally Gaussian approximation offers greater flexibility for inference, when combined with established Bayesian techniques. In particular, unlike the Euler-Maruyama-based approaches, we do not have to impose restrictive structures on the hypoelliptic IPSs. We present numerical experiments that illustrate the effectiveness of our approach, both with complete and partial particle observations.

Two tales for a geometric Jensen--Shannon divergence
Frank Nielsen
Comments:
28 pages
Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT); Machine Learning (cs.LG)
The geometric Jensen--Shannon divergence (G-JSD) gained popularity in machine learning and information sciences thanks to its closed-form expression between Gaussian distributions. In this work, we introduce an alternative definition of the geometric Jensen--Shannon divergence tailored to positive densities which does not normalize geometric mixtures. This novel divergence is termed the extended G-JSD as it applies to the more general case of positive measures. We report explicitly the gap between the extended G-JSD and the G-JSD when considering probability densities, and show how to express the G-JSD and extended G-JSD using the Jeffreys divergence and the Bhattacharyya distance or Bhattacharyya coefficient. The extended G-JSD is proven to be a $f$-divergence which is a separable divergence satisfying information monotonicity and invariance in information geometry. We derive corresponding closed-form formula for the two types of G-JSDs when considering the case of multivariate Gaussian distributions often met in applications. We consider Monte Carlo stochastic estimations and approximations of the two types of G-JSD using the projective $\gamma$-divergences. Although the square root of the JSD yields a metric distance, we show that this is not anymore the case for the two types of G-JSD. Finally, we explain how these two types of geometric JSDs can be interpreted as regularizations of the ordinary JSD.

Joint Moments of Characteristic Polynomials from the Orthogonal and Unitary Symplectic Groups

We establish asymptotic formulae for general joint moments of characteristic polynomials and their higher-order derivatives associated with matrices drawn randomly from the groups $\mathrm{USp}(2N)$ and $\mathrm{SO}(2N)$ in the limit as $N\to\infty$. This relates the leading-order asymptotic contribution in each case to averages over the Laguerre ensemble of random matrices. We uncover an exact connection between these joint moments and a solution of the $\sigma$-Painlevé V equation, valid for finite matrix size, as well as a connection between the leading-order asymptotic term and a solution of the $\sigma$-Painlevé III$'$ equation in the limit as $N \rightarrow \infty$. These connections enable us to derive exact formulae for joint moments for finite matrix size and for the joint moments of certain random variables arising from the Bessel point process in a recursive way. As an application, we provide a positive answer to a question proposed by Altuğ et al.

On $q$-analogs of the $3x+1$ Dynamical System
Kenneth G. Monks
Comments:
13 pages, 2 tables
Subjects:
Number Theory (math.NT); Dynamical Systems (math.DS)
The $3x+1$ Conjecture asserts that the $T$-orbit of every positive integer $x$ contains $1$, where $T$ maps $x$ to $x/2$ for $x$ even and to $(3x+1)/2$ for $x$ odd. Several authors have studied the analogous map, $T_q$, which maps $x\in F_2[q]$ to $x/q$ if $q$ divides $x$ and $((1+q)x+1)/q$ otherwise. In particular, they showed that the $T_q$-orbit of every polynomial contains $1$. This seems analogous to the $3x+1$ conjecture, but does not prove the conjecture itself, as the dynamical systems involved are not conjugate via any correspondence between polynomials and positive integers.
In this paper, we show that $T_q$ actually is conjugate to $T$ if we extend their domains to the ring of formal power series $F_2[[q]]$ and the 2-adic integers $\mathbb{Z}_2$, respectively. Thus, it is not polynomials that correspond to positive integers via conjugacy, but rather certain formal power series.
We then generalize this result to the family of functions $T_{A,B}\colon F_2[[q]]\to F_2[[q]]$ mapping $x$ to $x/q$ if $q$ divides $x$ and $(Ax+B)/q$ otherwise, where $A,B\in F_2[[q]]$ are not divisible by $q$. Unlike $T_q$, some of these maps do have the property that polynomials correspond to the positive integers whose $T$-orbit contains $1$ via a conjugacy with $T$. We show that $T_{1,1+q^2}$ is one such map, and has the additional nice property that the orbit of every polynomial enters either the unique $2$-cycle or one of the two fixed points.
Finally, the power series that correspond to the natural numbers via these conjugacies can be represented as rational numbers with odd denominators by replacing $q$ with $2$ and interpreting the resulting formal series as a 2-adic integer. Finding a simple closed form for even one such correspondence could settle the conjecture itself, and we provide some data along these lines for both $T_{1,1+q^2}$ and $T_q$.

A convergent Fourier spectral Galerkin method for the fractional Camassa-Holm equation

Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
We analyze a Fourier spectral Galerkin method for the fractional Camassa-Holm (fCH) equation involving a fractional Laplacian of exponent $\alpha \in [1,2]$ with periodic boundary conditions. The semi-discrete scheme preserves both mass and energy invariants of the fCH equation. For the fractional Benjamin-Bona-Mahony reduction, we establish existence and uniqueness of semi-discrete solutions and prove strong convergence to the unique solution in $ C^1([0, T];H^{\alpha}_{\mathrm{per}}(I))$ for given $T>0$. For the general fCH equation, we demonstrate spectral accuracy in spatial discretization with optimal error estimates $\mathcal{O}(N^{-r})$ for initial data $u_0 \in H^r(I)$ with $r \geq \alpha + 2$ and exponential convergence $\mathcal{O}(e^{-cN})$ for smooth solutions. Numerical experiments validate orbital stability of solitary waves achieving optimal convergence, confirming theoretical findings.

Subjects:
Differential Geometry (math.DG); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
Uniqueness (up to isometries) and existence of limits are analyzed in the context of Cheeger-Gromov convergence of spacetimes. To face the non-compactness of the vector isometry group in the semi-Riemanian setting, standard \em{pointed} convergence is strenghtened to \em{anchored} convergence (which requires the convergence of a timelike direction in the Lorenzian case). Then, a local isometry between the neighborhoods of the basepoints is found, and extended globally under geodesic completeness and simple connectedness. In spacetimes, by using Cauchy temporal functions as both strengthenings of the anchor and tools to ``Wick rotate'' metrics, a new notion of convergence for globally hyperbolic spacetimes (including the case of timelike boundaries) is introduced. The machinery of Riemannian Cheeger-Gromov theory becomes applicable after revisiting the tools related to time functions and studying their connections with Sormani-Vega null distance. In particular, several results with interest on its own right are obtained such as: time functions are locally Lipschitz up to rescaling, global and local characterizations of $h$-steep functions, independence of steepness and $h$-steepness for temporal functions, compatibility of both conditions for Cauchy temporal functions, and the stability of the latter.

Explicit Runge-Kutta schemes for Backward Stochastic Differential Equations
Shuixin Fang, Weidong Zhao, Tao Zhou
Comments:

Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
The Butcher theory provides a powerful tool for analyzing order conditions of Runge-Kutta schemes for ordinary differential equations (ODEs); however, such a theory has not yet been well established for backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) -- motivating the current work to address this gap. Specifically, we propose a new class of explicit Runge-Kutta schemes for BSDEs. These schemes admit a concise formulation that closely mirrors their ODE counterparts. Building on this formulation, we extend the Butcher theory to the proposed schemes, thereby enabling a symbolic derivation of Taylor expansions for the local truncation errors, and yielding the order conditions. Our approach preserves the elegance and generality of the original Butcher theory: it avoids stage-by-stage error expansions and provides a systematic, stage-inductive analysis, applicable to schemes with any number of stages and any target order. Numerical experiments support the theoretical results.

We show that $P$ is semi-free if it is semi-projective and it is categorically free if it is categorically projective. It can be considered as a generalization of the well-known Quillen-Suslin Theorem in DG context. As an application, we show that the ghost length and the cone length of a compact DG module coincide.

The random current representation of the Ising model, along with a related path expansion, has been a source of insight on the stochastic geometric underpinning of the ferromagnetic model's phase structure and critical behavior in different dimensions. This representation is extended here to systems with a mild amount of frustration, such as generated by disorder operators and external field of mixed signs. Further examples of the utility of such stochastic geometric representations are presented in the context of the deconfinement transition of the $Z_2$ lattice gauge model -- particularly in three dimensions -- and in streamlined proofs of correlation inequalities with wide-ranging applications.

Quasi-Monte Carlo integration over $\mathbb{R}^s$ with boundary-damping importance sampling
Zexin Pan, Du Ouyang, Zhijian He
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
This paper proposes a new importance sampling (IS) that is tailored to quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) integration over $\mathbb{R}^s$. IS introduces a multiplicative adjustment to the integrand by compensating the sampling from the proposal instead of the target distribution. Improper proposals result in severe adjustment factor for QMC. Our strategy is to first design a adjustment factor to meet desired regularities and then determine a tractable transport map from the standard uniforms to the proposal for using QMC quadrature points as inputs. The transport map has the effect of damping the boundary growth of the resulting integrand so that the effectiveness of QMC can be reclaimed. Under certain conditions on the original integrand, our proposed IS enjoys a fast convergence rate independently of the dimension $s$, making it amenable to high-dimensional problems.

Building upon the work of Berglund (2018), we establish a method for constructing subsets $B \subseteq \mathbb{Z}_{mk}$ such that $B$ does not contain any $k$-term cyclic arithmetic progressions mod $mk$, where $m,k \in \mathbb{Z}^+$ with $k \geq 3$. This construction thereby provides concrete lower bounds for the maximum size of such subsets. Additionally, it allows us to tightly bound specific chromatic numbers $\chi(mk,k)$ of $\mathbb{Z}_{mk}$ and helps increase the lower bounds of certain cyclic Van der Waerden numbers $W_{c}(k,r)$, originally introduced by Burkert and Johnson (2011) as a way of bounding the standard Van der Waerden numbers $W(k,r)$ from below for $r \geq 2$.

Normalized Derivations for Milnor's Primitive Operations on the Dickson Algebra and Applications

Subjects:
Algebraic Topology (math.AT)
Our work investigates the action of primitive Milnor operations $St^{\Delta_i}$ on the Dickson algebra $D_n$ over $\mathbb{F}_p$, building upon a foundational formula by Nguyen Sum [3]. Our central contribution is the introduction of a normalized operator, $\delta_i$, by factoring out the ubiquitous invariant $Q_{n, 0}$. This normalization transforms $St^{\Delta_i}$ into a true derivation on the localized Dickson algebra, thereby establishing an elegant differential framework. This framework yields two new significant results: first, a closed-form formula for all higher iterates of the operator, revealing a strong factorial-based vanishing criterion for iterates of order $\geq p$. Second, the discovery of a normalized coordinate system where the action has constant coefficients. This latter insight reduces the problem of computing the associated Margolis homology to a standard Koszul complex computation, in direct analogy with a recent result by Ngo Anh Tuan [4]. As further consequences, we also construct a large family of kernel elements and describe the global structure of the action.

A $\sqrt{2}$-accelerated FISTA for composite strongly convex problems
Kansei Ushiyama
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
In this paper, we propose a novel accelerated forward-backward splitting algorithm for minimizing convex composite functions, written as the sum of a smooth function and a (possibly) nonsmooth function. When the objective function is strongly convex, the method attains, to the best of our knowledge, the fastest known convergence rate, yielding a simultaneous linear and sublinear nonasymptotic bound. Our convergence analysis remains valid even when one of the two terms is only weakly convex (while the sum remains convex). The algorithm is derived by discretizing a continuous-time model of the Information-Theoretic Exact Method (ITEM), which is the optimal method for unconstrained strongly convex minimization.

A preconditioned third-order implicit-explicit algorithm with a difference of varying convex functions and extrapolation
Kelin Wu, Hongpeng Sun
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC); Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
This paper proposes a novel preconditioned implicit-explicit algorithm enhanced with the extrapolation technique for non-convex optimization problems. The algorithm employs a third-order Adams-Bashforth scheme for the nonlinear and explicit parts and a third-order backward differentiation formula for the implicit part of the gradient flow in variational functions. The proposed algorithm, akin to a generalized difference-of-convex (DC) approach, employs a changing set of convex functions in each iteration. Under the Kurdyka-Łojasiewicz (KL) properties, the global convergence of the algorithm is guaranteed, ensuring that it converges within a finite number of preconditioned iterations. Our numerical experiments, including least squares problems with SCAD regularization and the graphical Ginzburg-Landau model, demonstrate the proposed algorithm's highly efficient performance compared to conventional DC algorithms.

A determinant-line and degree obstruction to foliation transversality
Mostafa Khosravi Farsani
Subjects:
Geometric Topology (math.GT)
Let pi: M^{ell+n} -> B^n be a submersion that presents a regular foliation by its fibers, and let S^n subset M be a closed embedded complementary submanifold, with f = pi|S: S -> B. We give two concise obstructions to keeping S everywhere transverse. (A) Determinant-line obstruction: with L = det(TS)^* tensor f^* det(TB) -> S, a C^1-small perturbation makes the tangency locus Z = {det(df) = 0} subset S a closed (n-1)-dimensional submanifold whose mod 2 fundamental class equals PD(w1(L)) in H{n-1}(S; Z_2). In particular, when n = 1 the set of tangencies is finite and the parity of #Z equals the pairing <w1(L), [S]> mod 2. (B) Twisted homology/degree obstruction: if pi is proper with connected fibers and f_[S]_{f^ O_B} = 0 in H_n(B; O_B) (top homology with the orientation local system), then S must be tangent somewhere. These recover the covering-space argument in the orientable case and extend to nonorientable settings via w1(L). We also give short applications beyond the classical degree test, including the case H_n(B; O_B) = 0 and a nonorientable base with vanishing top homology.

On the Squared Distance Matrix of a Starlike Block Graph

Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
Let $D(G)$ be the distance matrix of a simple connected graph $G$. The Hadamard product $D(G)~\circ~ D(G)$ is called the squared distance matrix of $G$, and is denoted by $\Delta(G)$. A simple connected graph is called a starlike block graph if it has a central cut vertex, and each of its blocks is a complete graph. Let $ \mathcal{S}(n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_b)$ be the starlike block graph with blocks $K_{n_1+1}, K_{n_2+1}, \ldots, K_{n_b+1} $ on $n=1 + \sum_{i=1}^b n_i$ vertices. In this article, we compute the determinant of $\Delta( \mathcal{S}(n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_b))$ and find its inverse as a rank-one perturbation of a positive semidefinite Laplacian-like matrix $\mathcal{L}$ with rank $n-1$. We also investigate the inertia of $\Delta( \mathcal{S}(n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_b))$. Furthermore, for a fixed value of $ n $ and $ b $, we determine the extremal graphs that uniquely attain the maximum and minimum spectral radius of the squared distance matrix for starlike block graphs on $ n $ vertices and $ b $ blocks.

Alexandrov estimates for polynomial operators by determinant majorization

We obtain estimates on the supremum, infimum and oscillation of solutions for a wide class of inhomogeneous fully nonlinear elliptic equations on Euclidean domains where the differential operator is an I-central Garding-Dirichlet operator in the sense of Harvey-Lawson (2024). The argument combines two recent results: an Alexandrov estimate of Payne-Redaelli (2025) for locally semiconvex functions based on the area formula and a determinant majorization estimate of Harvey-Lawson (2024).
The determinant majorization estimate has as a special case the arithmetic - geometric mean inequality, so the result includes the classical Alexandrov-Bakelman-Pucci estimate for linear operators. A potential theoretic approach is used involving subequation subharmonics and their dual subharmonics. Semiconvex approximation plays a crucial role.

We see that verification of such an inequality depends on the sign of the Big-o function in the Mertens estimate for the sum of reciprocals of primes that. Then we analyze the value of such an error term.

Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
We generalize a theorem of Lair concerning the existence of positive entire large solutions to competitive semilinear elliptic systems. While Lair's original result \cite{Lair2025} was established for power-type nonlinearities, our work extends the theory to a broad class of general nonlinearities satisfying a Keller--Osserman-type growth condition. The proof follows the same conceptual framework monotone iteration to construct global positive solutions, reduction to a scalar inequality for the sum of the components, application of a Keller--Osserman transform, and a two-step radial integration argument but replaces the explicit power-law growth with a general monotone envelope function. This approach yields a unified and verifiable criterion for the existence of large solutions in terms of the Keller--Osserman integral, thereby encompassing both critical and supercritical growth regimes within a single analytical setting.

Symmetry reduction and induction enable the method to be deployed on an infinite family of ideals. We also give an explicit description of the matroids on which the methodology depends, in the context of multiview ideals.

On the $P(t)$-adic Littlewood Conjecture in Characteristics $\ell \equiv 3\pmod{4}$
Faustin Adiceam, Dzmitry Badziahin
Subjects:
Number Theory (math.NT); Combinatorics (math.CO); Dynamical Systems (math.DS)
Given a prime $p$, the $p$-adic Littlewood Conjecture stands as a well-known arithmetic variant of the celebrated Littlewood Conjecture in Diophantine Approximation. In the same way as the latter, it admits a natural function field analogue depending on the choice of an irreducible polynomial $P(t)$ with coefficients in a field $\mathbb{K}$. This analogue is referred to as the $P(t)$-adic Littlewood Conjecture ($P(t)$-LC for short).
$P(t)$-LC is proved to fail for any choice of irreducible polynomial $P(t)$ over any ground field $\mathbb{K}$ with characteristic $ \ell \equiv 3\pmod{4}$. The counterexample refuting it is shown to present a local arithmetic obstruction emerging from the fact that -1 is not a quadratic residue modulo a prime $\ell\equiv 3\pmod{4}$.
The theory developed elucidates and generalises all previous approaches towards refuting the conjecture. They were all based on the computer-assisted method initiated by Adiceam, Nesharim and Lunnon (2021) which has been able to establish that $P(t)$-LC fails in some small characteristics (essentially up to 11). This computer-assisted method is, however, unable to provide a general statement as it relies on ad hoc computer verifications which, provided they terminate, refute $P(t)$--LC in a given characteristic. This limitation is overcome by exhibiting an arithmetic obstruction to the validity of $P(t)$--LC in infinitely many characteristics.
The existence of arithmetic obstructions within the context of $P(t)$--LC leaves the remaining case of odd characteristics $ \ell\equiv 1\pmod{4}$ dependent on their determination. This is shown to hold in an effective and explicit way.

Parities in random Latin squares

Subjects:
Probability (math.PR); Combinatorics (math.CO)
In a Latin square, every row can be interpreted as a permutation, and therefore has a parity (even or odd). We prove that in a uniformly random $n\times n$ Latin square, the $n$ row parities are very well approximated by a sequence of $n$ independent unbiased coin flips: for example, the total variation error of this approximation tends to zero as $n\to\infty$. This resolves a conjecture of Cameron. In fact, we prove a generalisation of Cameron's conjecture for the joint distribution of the row parities, column parities and symbol parities (the latter are defined by the symmetry between rows, columns and symbols of a Latin square).
Along the way, we introduce several general techniques for the study of random Latin squares, including a new re-randomisation technique via `stable intercalate switchings', and a new approximation theorem comparing random Latin squares with a certain independent model.

In \cite{Broer1993}, it was shown that certain line bundles on $\widetilde{\mathcal{N}}=T^*G/B$ have vanishing higher cohomology. We prove a generalization of this theorem for real reductive groups in the case when $G$ is adjoint. More specifically, if $\mathcal{N}_\theta$ denotes the cone of nilpotent elements in a Cartan subspace $\mathfrak{p},$ we have a similar construction of a resolution of singularities $\widetilde{\mathcal{N}_\theta}.$ We prove that for a certain cone of weights $H^i(\widetilde{\mathcal{N}_\theta},\mathcal{O}_{\widetilde{\mathcal{N}_\theta}}(\lambda))=0$ for $i> 0.$ This follows by combining a simple calculation of the canonical bundle for $\widetilde{\mathcal{N}_\theta}$ with Grauert-Riemenschneider vanishing. We use this to show that for groups of QCT (Definition 2), $\mathbb{C}[\mathcal{N}_\theta]$ is equivalent as a $K$-representation to a certain cohomologically induced module giving a new proof of a result in \cite{KostantRallis1971}.

Title:
Convergence of Pivoted Cholesky Algorithm for Lipschitz Kernels
Sungwoo Jeong, Alex Townsend
Comments:
18 pages, 4 figures
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
We investigate the continuous analogue of the Cholesky factorization, namely the pivoted Cholesky algorithm. Our analysis establishes quantitative convergence guarantees for kernels of minimal smoothness. We prove that for a symmetric positive definite Lipschitz continuous kernel $K:\Omega\times \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ on a compact domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^d$, the residual of the Cholesky algorithm with any pivoting strategy is uniformly bounded above by a constant multiple of the fill distance of pivots. In particular, our result implies that under complete pivoting (where the maximum value of the diagonal of the residual is selected as the next pivot): \begin{equation*}
\|R_n\|_{\infty} = O(n^{-1/d}), \end{equation*} where $R_n$ is the residual after $n$ Cholesky steps and $\|\cdot\|_\infty$ is the absolute maximum value of $R_n$. Moreover, if $K$ is differentiable in both variables with a Lipschitz derivative, our convergence rate improves to $O(n^{-2/d})$. Our result closes a gap between theory and practice as previous analyses required $C^2$-regularity of $K$ to establish convergence, whereas empirical evidence indicated robust performance even for non-differentiable kernels. We further detail how our convergence results propagate to downstream applications, including discrete analogues, Gaussian process regression, and the P-greedy interpolation method.

Skew braces and Rota-Baxter operators on semi-direct products

Subjects:
Quantum Algebra (math.QA); Group Theory (math.GR); Rings and Algebras (math.RA)
This paper examines the connections between (relative) Rota-Baxter groups, skew left braces, and enlargements of these structures on naturally associated semi-direct products. For any skew left brace, we introduce a new skew left brace, called the square, on the natural semi-direct product of its additive and multiplicative groups. Further, the square construction turns out to be distinct from the previously known double construction arising as a special case of matched pairs of skew braces. This provides a method to construct a new bijective, non-degenerate solution to the Yang-Baxter equation from an existing solution arising from a skew left brace. We show that the square construction is functorial and integrates naturally into both the cohomological and extension-theoretic frameworks for (relative) Rota-Baxter groups and skew left braces. Furthermore, we provide a sufficient condition under which two isoclinic skew left braces yield isoclinic squares.

A Chinese restaurant process for multiset permutations
Dudley Stark
Comments:
9 pages, typo in the factorisation example after Theorem 1 corrected
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
Multisets are like sets, except that they can contain multiple copies of their elements. If there are $n_i$ copies of $i$, $1\leq i\leq t$, in multiset $M_t$, then there are $\binom{n_1+\cdots+n_t}{n_1,\ldots, n_t}$ possible permutations of $M_t$. Knuth showed how to factor any multiset permutation into cycles. For fixed $n_i$, $i\geq 1$, we show how to adapt the Chinese restaurant process, which generates random permutations on $n$ elements with weighting $\theta^{\# \, {\rm cycles}}$, $\theta>0$, sequentially for $n=1,2,\ldots$, to the multiset case, where we fix the $n_i$ and build permutations on $M_t$ sequentially for $t=1,2,\ldots$. The number of cycles of a multiset permutation chosen uniformly at random, i.e.~$\theta=1$, has distribution given by the sum of independent negative hypergeometric distributed random variables. For all $\theta>0$, and under the assumption that $n_i=O(1)$, we show a central limit theorem as $t\to\infty$ for the number of cycles.

Rigidity of strong and weak foliations
Boris Kalinin, Victoria Sadovskaya
Comments:

Subjects:
Dynamical Systems (math.DS)
We consider a perturbation $f$ of a hyperbolic toral automorphism $L$. We study rigidity related to exceptional properties of the strong and weak stable foliations for $f$. If the strong foliation is mapped to the linear one by the conjugacy $h$ between $f$ and $L$, we obtain smoothness of $h$ along the weak foliation and regularity of the joint foliation of the strong and unstable foliations. We also establish a similar global result. If the weak foliation is sufficiently regular, we obtain smoothness of the conjugacy along the strong foliation and regularity of the joint foliation of the weak and unstable foliations. If both conditions hold then we get smoothness of $h$ along the stable foliation. We also deduce a rigidity result for the symplectic case. The main theorems are obtained in a unified way using our new result on relation between holonomes and normal forms.

The fundamental notion of non-abelian generalized cohomology gained recognition in algebraic topology as the non-abelian Poincaré-dual to "factorization homology", and in theoretical physics as providing flux-quantization for non-linear Gauss laws. However, already the archetypical example -- unstable Cohomotopy, first studied almost a century ago by Pontrjagin -- has remained underappreciated as a cohomology theory and has only recently received attention as a flux-quantizaton law ("Hypothesis H").
Here we lay out a general construction of the analogue of the Chern character map on twisted equivariant non-abelian cohomology theories (with equivariantly simply-connected classifying spaces) and illustrate the construction by spelling out a twisted equivariant form of Cohomotopy as an archetypical and intriguing running example, essentially by computing its equivariant Sullivan model.
We close with an outlook on the application of this result to the rigorous deduction of anyonic quantum states on M5-branes wrapped over Seifert 3-orbifolds.

On the Identity and Group Problems for Complex Heisenberg Matrices
Paul C. Bell, Reino Niskanen, Igor Potapov, Pavel Semukhin
Subjects:
Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM); Combinatorics (math.CO)
We study the Identity Problem, the problem of determining if a finitely generated semigroup of matrices contains the identity matrix; see Problem 3 (Chapter 10.3) in ``Unsolved Problems in Mathematical Systems and Control Theory'' by Blondel and Megretski (2004). This fundamental problem is known to be undecidable for $\mathbb{Z}^{4 \times 4}$ and decidable for $\mathbb{Z}^{2 \times 2}$. The Identity Problem has been recently shown to be in polynomial time by Dong for the Heisenberg group over complex numbers in any fixed dimension with the use of Lie algebra and the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula. We develop alternative proof techniques for the problem making a step forward towards more general problems such as the Membership Problem. Using our techniques we also show that the problem of determining if a given set of Heisenberg matrices generates a group can be decided in polynomial time.

We study a multicomponent $CP^N$ model's scalar electrodynamics. The model contains Q-balls/shells, which are non-topological compact solitons with time dependency $e^{i\omega t}$. Two coupled $CP^N$ models can decouple locally if one of their $CP^N$ fields takes the vacuum value. Because of the compacton nature of solutions, Q-shells can shelter another compact Q-ball or Q-shell within their hollow region. Even if compactons do not overlap, they can interact through the electromagnetic field. We investigate how the size of multi-compacton formations is affected by electric charge. We are interested in structures with non-zero or zero total net charge.

A novel procedure is presented which allows the construction of all axial vector fields on Riemannian two-spheres. Using these axial vector fields and the centre-of-mass unit sphere reference systems, a constructive definition of quasi-local spin-angular momentum is introduced. Balance relations are also derived, with respect to arbitrary Lie-propagated unit sphere reference systems, to characterize the angular momentum transports in spacetimes without symmetries.

Towards designing learned optimization algorithms that are usable beyond their training setting, we identify key principles that classical algorithms obey, but have up to now, not been used for Learning to Optimize (L2O). Following these principles, we provide a general design pipeline, taking into account data, architecture and learning strategy, and thereby enabling a synergy between classical optimization and L2O, resulting in a philosophy of Learning Optimization Algorithms. As a consequence our learned algorithms perform well far beyond problems from the training distribution. We demonstrate the success of these novel principles by designing a new learning-enhanced BFGS algorithm and provide numerical experiments evidencing its adaptation to many settings at test time.

After the introduction of Section 1, Section 2 examines a number of commonly used estimators for p > n. Section 3 introduces prediction with p > n. Section 4 introduces notational changes to facilitate discussion of overfitting and Section 5 illustrates the phenomenon of double descent. We conclude with some final comments.

Nordic skiing provides fascinating opportunities for mathematical modelling studies that exploit methods and insights from physics, applied mathematics, data analysis, scientific computing and sports science. A typical ski course winds over varied terrain with frequent changes in elevation and direction, and so its geometry is naturally described by a three-dimensional space curve. The skier travels along a course under the influence of various forces, and their dynamics can be described using a nonlinear system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that are derived from Newton's laws of motion. We develop an algorithm for solving the governing equations that combines Hermite spline interpolation, numerical quadrature and a high-order ODE solver. Numerical simulations are compared with measurements of skiers on actual courses to demonstrate the effectiveness of the model. Throughout, we aim to illustrate how elementary concepts from undergraduate courses in calculus and scientific computing can be applied to study real problems in sport, which we hope will provide stimulating examples for both instructors and students. At the same time, we demonstrate how these concepts are capable of providing novel insights into skiing that should also be of interest to sport scientists.

We introduce the concept of pseudo-reality for complex numbers. We show that this concept, applied to quantum fields, provides a unifying framework for two distinct approaches to pseudo-Hermitian quantum field theories. The first approach stems from analytically continuing Hermitian theories into the complex plane, while the second is based on constructing them from first principles. The pseudo-reality condition for bosonic fields resolves a long-standing problem with the formulation of gauge theories involving pseudo-Hermitian currents, sheds new light on the resolution of the so-called Hermiticity Puzzle, and may allow a consistent minimal coupling of pseudo-Hermitian quantum field theories to gravity. We focus on the $i\phi^3$ cubic scalar theory, obtaining the relevant pseudo-reality conditions up to quadratic order in the coupling; a theory of two complex scalar fields with non-Hermitian mass mixing; and the latter's coupling to a $U(1)$ gauge field. The general principle of pseudo-reality, however, is expected to contribute to the ongoing development of the first-principles construction of pseudo-Hermitian quantum field theories, including their formulation in curved spacetimes.

Advanced Physics-Informed Neural Network with Residuals for Solving Complex Integral Equations

Subjects:
Machine Learning (cs.LG); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE); Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
In this paper, we present the Residual Integral Solver Network (RISN), a novel neural network architecture designed to solve a wide range of integral and integro-differential equations, including one-dimensional, multi-dimensional, ordinary and partial integro-differential, systems, fractional types, and Helmholtz-type integral equations involving oscillatory kernels. RISN integrates residual connections with high-accuracy numerical methods such as Gaussian quadrature and fractional derivative operational matrices, enabling it to achieve higher accuracy and stability than traditional Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN). The residual connections help mitigate vanishing gradient issues, allowing RISN to handle deeper networks and more complex kernels, particularly in multi-dimensional problems. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that RISN consistently outperforms not only classical PINNs but also advanced variants such as Auxiliary PINN (A-PINN) and Self-Adaptive PINN (SA-PINN), achieving significantly lower Mean Absolute Errors (MAE) across various types of equations. These results highlight RISN's robustness and efficiency in solving challenging integral and integro-differential problems, making it a valuable tool for real-world applications where traditional methods often struggle.

Subjects:

Machine learning explorations can make significant inroads into solving difficult problems in pure mathematics. One advantage of this approach is that mathematical datasets do not suffer from noise, but a challenge is the amount of data required to train these models and that this data can be computationally expensive to generate. Key challenges further comprise difficulty in a posteriori interpretation of statistical models and the implementation of deep and abstract mathematical problems.
We propose a method for scalable tasks, by which models trained on simpler versions of a task can then generalize to the full task. Specifically, we demonstrate that a transformer neural-network trained on predicting permutations from words formed by general transpositions in the symmetric group $S_{10}$ can generalize to the symmetric group $S_{25}$ with near 100\% accuracy. We also show that $S_{10}$ generalizes to $S_{16}$ with similar performance if we only use adjacent transpositions. We employ identity augmentation as a key tool to manage variable word lengths, and partitioned windows for training on adjacent transpositions. Finally we compare variations of the method used and discuss potential challenges with extending the method to other tasks.

Infinite-fold Asymptotic Quantum Advantage in Classical Correlation Sensing

Presented at IEEE Quantum Week 2025
Subjects:

We study the hypothesis testing problem of distinguishing between correlated thermal noise and uncorrelated thermal noise of the same average energy on $K$ detectors in asymptotic asymmetric hypothesis testing. We compare the performance of heterodyne or homodyne detection with classical post-processing, the most general quantum strategy (involving any arbitrary measurement), and a simple strategy involving a photonic chip and On-Off detection. When the average received energy per detector goes to zero, the photonic chip strategy asymptotically achieves the optimal decrease in the error, while heterodyne/homodyne measurements do not. Thus, we show that linear optics and On-Off measurement are enough to achieve better detection than classical methods when detecting correlations in thermal optical signals.

Methodology (stat.ME); Statistics Theory (math.ST)
Since the idea of fiducial inference was put forward by Fisher, researchers have been attempting to place it within a rigorous and well motivated framework. It is fair to say that a general definition has remained elusive. In this paper we start with a representation of Bayesian posterior distributions provided by Doob that relies on martingales. This is explicit in defining how a true parameter value should depend on a random sample and hence an approach to "inverse probability" as originally conceived by Fisher. Taking this as our cue, we introduce a definition of fiducial inference that can be regarded as general.

Understanding and controlling the informational complexity of neural networks is a central challenge in machine learning, with implications for generalization, optimization, and model capacity. While most approaches rely on entropy-based loss functions and statistical metrics, these measures often fail to capture deeper, causally relevant algorithmic regularities embedded in network structure. We propose a shift toward algorithmic information theory, using Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs) as a first proxy. Grounded in algorithmic probability (AP) and the universal distribution it defines, our approach characterizes learning dynamics through a formal, causally grounded lens. We apply the Block Decomposition Method (BDM) -- a scalable approximation of algorithmic complexity based on AP -- and demonstrate that it more closely tracks structural changes during training than entropy, consistently exhibiting stronger correlations with training loss across varying model sizes and randomized training runs. These results support the view of training as a process of algorithmic compression, where learning corresponds to the progressive internalization of structured regularities. In doing so, our work offers a principled estimate of learning progression and suggests a framework for complexity-aware learning and regularization, grounded in first principles from information theory, complexity, and computability.

Critical point search and linear response theory for computing electronic excitation energies of molecular systems. Part I: General framework, application to Hartree-Fock and DFT

Subjects:
Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
Computing excited states of many-body quantum Hamiltonians is a fundamental challenge in computational physics and chemistry, with state-of-the-art methods broadly classified into variational (critical point search) and linear response approaches. The Kähler manifold formalism provides a uniform framework which naturally accommodates both strategies for a wide range of variational models, including Hartree-Fock, CASSCF, Full CI, and adiabatic TDDFT. In particular, this formalism leads to a systematic and straightforward way to obtain the final equations of linear response theory for nonlinear models, which provides, in the case of mean-field models (Hartree-Fock and DFT), a simple alternative to Casida's derivation. We detail the mathematical structure of Hamiltonian dynamics on Kähler manifolds, establish connections to standard quantum chemistry equations, and provide theoretical and numerical comparisons of excitation energy computation schemes at the Hartree-Fock level.

Identification and Estimation of Multi-order Tensor Factor Models
Zetai Cen
Comments:
45 pages, 3 figures
Subjects:
Methodology (stat.ME); Statistics Theory (math.ST)
We propose a novel framework in high-dimensional factor models to simultaneously analyse multiple tensor time series, each with potentially different tensor orders and dimensionality. The connection between different tensor time series is through their global factors that are correlated to each other. A salient feature of our model is that when all tensor time series have the same order, it can be regarded as an extension of multilevel factor models from vectors to general tensors. Under very mild conditions, we separate the global and local components in the proposed model. Parameter estimation is thoroughly discussed, including a consistent factor number estimator. With strong correlation between global factors and noise allowed, we derive the rates of convergence of our estimators, which can be more superior than those of existing methods for multilevel factor models. We also develop estimators that are more computationally efficient, with rates of convergence spelt out. Extensive experiments are performed under various settings, corroborating with the pronounced theoretical results. As a real application example, we analyse a set of taxi data to study the traffic flow between Times Squares and its neighbouring areas.

The $r$-matrix structure on the moduli space of framed Higgs pairs

Subjects:
Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems (nlin.SI); Symplectic Geometry (math.SG)
On the space of matrices with rational (trigonometric/elliptic) entries there is a well-known Lie-Poisson $r$-matrix structure. The known $r$-matrices are defined on the Riemann sphere (rational), the cylinder (trigonometric), or the torus (elliptic). We extend the formalism to the case of a Riemann surface $\mathcal C$ of higher genus $g$: we consider the moduli space of framed vector bundles of rank $n$ and degree $ng$, where the framing consists in a choice of basis of $n$ independent holomorphic sections chosen to trivialize the fiber at a given point $\infty\in \mathcal C$. The co-tangent space is known to be identified with the set of Higgs fields, i.e., one-forms on $\mathcal C$ with values in the endomorphisms of the vector bundle, with an additional simple pole at $\infty$. The natural symplectic structure on the co-tangent bundle of the moduli space induces a Poisson structure on the Higgs fields. The result is then an explicit $r$--matrix that generalizes the known ones. A detailed discussion of the elliptic case with comparison to the literature is also provided.

System Reliability Estimation via Shrinkage
Beidi Qiang, Edsel Pena
Subjects:
Methodology (stat.ME); Statistics Theory (math.ST)
In a coherent reliability system composed of multiple components configured according to a specific structure function, the distribution of system time to failure, or system lifetime, is often of primary interest. Accurate estimation of system reliability is critical in a wide range of engineering and industrial applications, forming decisions in system design, maintenance planning, and risk assessment. The system lifetime distribution can be estimated directly using the observed system failure times. However, when component-level lifetime data is available, it can yield improved estimates of system reliability. In this work, we demonstrate that under nonparametric assumptions about the component time-to-failure distributions, traditional estimators such as the Product-Limit Estimator (PLE) can be further improved under specific loss functions. We propose a novel methodology that enhances the nonparametric system reliability estimation through a shrinkage transformation applied to component-level estimators. This shrinkage approach leads to improved efficiency in estimating system reliability.

4-uniform Maker-Breaker and Maker-Maker games are PSPACE-complete
Florian Galliot
Subjects:
Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM); Computational Complexity (cs.CC); Combinatorics (math.CO)
We study two positional games where two players take turns picking a previously unpicked vertex of a hypergraph $H$. We say a player fills an edge of $H$ if that player has picked all the vertices of that edge. In the Maker-Maker game, whoever first fills an edge wins, or we get a draw if no edge is filled. In the Maker-Breaker game, the first player aims at filling an edge while the second player aims at preventing the first player from filling an edge. We show that, for both games, deciding whether the first player has a winning strategy is a PSPACE-complete problem even when restricted to 4-uniform hypergraphs. For the Maker-Maker game, this improves on a previous result for hypergraphs of rank 4. For the Maker-Breaker game, this improves on a previous result for 5-uniform hypergraphs, and closes the complexity gap as the problem for hypergraphs of rank 3 is known to be solvable in polynomial time.

Non-universal Thermal Hall Responses in Fractional Quantum Hall Droplets
Fei Tan, Yuzhu Wang, Xinghao Wang, Bo Yang
Subjects:
Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall); Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
We analytically compute the thermal Hall conductance (THC) of fractional quantum Hall droplets under realistic conditions that go beyond the idealized linear edge theory with conformal symmetry. Specifically, we consider finite-size effects at low temperature, nonzero self-energies of quasiholes, and general edge dispersions. We derive measurable corrections in THC that align well with the experimental observables. Although the quantized THC is commonly regarded as a topological invariant that is independent of edge confinement, our results show that this quantization remains robust only for arbitrary edge dispersion in the thermodynamic limit. Furthermore, the THC contributed by Abelian modes can become extremely sensitive to finite-size effects and irregular confining potentials in any realistic experimental system. In contrast, non-Abelian modes show robust THC signatures under perturbations, indicating an intrinsic stability of non-Abelian anyons.
