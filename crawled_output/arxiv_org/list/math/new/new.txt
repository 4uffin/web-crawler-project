Title:
Haussdorff consistency of MLE in folded normal and Gaussian mixtures
Koustav Mallik
Comments:
27 pages. This is a series of works on nonidentifiable models
Subjects:
Statistics Theory (math.ST); Methodology (stat.ME)
We develop a constant-tracking likelihood theory for two nonregular models: the folded normal and finite Gaussian mixtures. For the folded normal, we prove boundary coercivity for the profiled likelihood, show that the profile path of the location parameter exists and is strictly decreasing by an implicit-function argument, and establish a unique profile maximizer in the scale parameter. Deterministic envelopes for the log-likelihood, the score, and the Hessian yield elementary uniform laws of large numbers with finite-sample bounds, avoiding covering numbers. Identification and Kullback-Leibler separation deliver consistency. A sixth-order expansion of the log hyperbolic cosine creates a quadratic-minus-quartic contrast around zero, leading to a nonstandard one-fourth-power rate for the location estimator at the kink and a standard square-root rate for the scale estimator, with a uniform remainder bound. For finite Gaussian mixtures with distinct components and positive weights, we give a short identifiability proof up to label permutations via Fourier and Vandermonde ideas, derive two-sided Gaussian envelopes and responsibility-based gradient bounds on compact sieves, and obtain almost-sure and high-probability uniform laws with explicit constants. Using a minimum-matching distance on permutation orbits, we prove Hausdorff consistency on fixed and growing sieves. We quantify variance-collapse spikes via an explicit spike-bonus bound and show that a quadratic penalty in location and log-scale dominates this bonus, making penalized likelihood coercive; when penalties shrink but sample size times penalty diverges, penalized estimators remain consistent. All proofs are constructive, track constants, verify measurability of maximizers, and provide practical guidance for tuning sieves, penalties, and EM-style optimization.

Title:
Generalized Non-Standard Finite Difference Method for Fractional PDEs on Non-Uniform Grids
Devank Mishra, Sheerin Kayenat, Amit K. Verma
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
This paper proposes a novel Generalized Non-Standard Finite Difference (GNSFD) scheme for the numerical solution of a class of fractional partial differential equations (FrPDEs). The formulation of the method is grounded in optimization and leverages the fractional Taylor series (FrTS) expansion associated with Caputo fractional derivatives (FrDs). To discretize the time derivatives, the non-trivial denominator functions are utilized. The theoretical analysis establishes the consistency, stability, and convergence of the proposed scheme. Results are compared against existing methods to substantiate the accuracy and computational efficiency of the approach.

This article, written for undergraduate mathematics students, provides an accessible introduction to a few key problems in tiling theory: Heesch's problem, the isohedral number problem, and the existence of an aperiodic monotile. I contributed to the solution of the last of these problems in 2023, but many related questions remain open and worthy of study. My goal is to get more students excited about studying tiling theory.

History and Overview (math.HO)
Let E be a point in the plane of a convex quadrilateral ABCD. The lines from E to the vertices of the quadrilateral form four triangles. If we locate a triangle center in each of these triangles, the four triangle centers form another quadrilateral called a central quadrilateral. For each of various shaped quadrilaterals, and each of 1000 different triangle centers, and for various choices for E, we examine the shape of the central quadrilateral. Using a computer, we determine when the central quadrilateral has a special shape, such as being a rhombus or a cyclic quadrilateral. A typical result is the following. Let E be the centroid of equidiagonal quadrilateral ABCD. Let F, G, H, and I be the X(591)-points of triangles ABE, BCE, CDE, and DAE, respectively. Then FGHI is an orthodiagonal quadrilateral

SRaFTE: Super-Resolution and Future Time Extrapolation for Time-Dependent PDEs
Hardeep Bassi, Yuanran Zhu, Erika Ye, Pu Ren, Alec Dektor, Harish S. Bhat, Chao Yang
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA); Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
We present SRaFTE (Super-Resolution and Future Time Extrapolation), a two-phase learning framework that couples coarse grid solvers with neural operators to super-resolve and forecast fine grid dynamics for time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs). In our construction, Phase 1 learns a super-resolution map from coarse to fine solutions, while Phase 2 embeds this operator in a predictor-corrector loop with the coarse solver, forming an operator composition that serves as a surrogate fine grid propagator for future-time extrapolation. We benchmark SRaFTE on three canonical two-dimensional PDEs of increasing dynamical complexity: the heat equation, the wave equation, and the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Compared to well-known benchmarks, SRaFTE provides reliable super-resolution in Phase 1 and delivers consistently accurate long-term forecasts in Phase 2 across all three examples for new test data. Our results suggest that coupling a learned super-resolution operator with a coarse grid solver provides an effective and efficient means of modeling high-resolution spatiotemporal dynamics, particularly when the dynamics of the PDEs at the coarse and fine resolutions exhibit pronounced scale separation.

Title:
Transmission Conditions for the Non-Overlapping Schwarz Coupling of Full Order and Operator Inference Models
Cameron Rodriguez, Irina Tezaur, Alejandro Mota, Anthony Gruber, Eric Parish, Christopher Wentland
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
This work investigates transmission conditions for the domain decomposition-based coupling of subdomain-local models using the non-overlapping Schwarz alternating method (NO-SAM). Building on prior efforts involving overlapping SAM (O-SAM), we formulate and assess two NO-SAM variants, based on alternating Dirichlet-Neumann and Robin-Robin transmission conditions. For the subdomain-local models, we consider a mix of full order models (FOMs) and non-intrusive reduced order models (ROMs) constructed via an emerging model reduction technique known as operator inference (OpInf). Of particular novelty is the first application of NO-SAM to couple non-intrusive OpInf ROMs with each other, and with FOMs. Numerical studies on a one-dimensional linear elastic wave propagation benchmark problem demonstrate that transmission condition choice and parameter tuning significantly impact convergence rate, accuracy, and stability. Robin-Robin coupling often yields faster convergence than alternating Dirichlet-Neumann, though improper parameter selection can induce spurious oscillations at subdomain interfaces. For FOM-OpInf and OpInf-OpInf couplings, sufficient modal content in the ROM basis improves accuracy and mitigates instability, in some cases outperforming the coupled FOM-FOM reference solutions in both accuracy and efficiency. These findings highlight NO-SAM's potential for enabling flexible, non-intrusive, and efficient multi-model coupling across independently meshed subdomains, while emphasizing the need for careful interface condition design in higher-dimensional and predictive settings.

Title:
Wave Function Collapse Set Covering and the Hill Climbing Algorithm: A New, Fast Heuristic and Metaheuristic Pairing for the Minimum Set Cover Problem
David Oprea, David Perkins
Comments:
14 pages
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC); Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE)
In this paper, we present a new heuristic that focuses on the optimization problem for the Minimum Set Cover Problem. Our new heuristic involves using Wave Function Collapse and is called Wave Function Collapse Set Covering (WFC-SC). This algorithm goes through observation, propagation, and collapsing, which will be explained more later on in this paper. We optimize this algorithm to quickly find optimal coverings that are close to the minimum needed. To further optimize this algorithm, we pair it with the Hill Climbing metaheuristic to help WFC-SC find a better solution than its "local optimum." We benchmark our algorithm using the well known OR library from Brunel University against other proficient algorithms. We find that our algorithm has a better balance between both optimality and time.

Title:
Bi-fidelity Interpolative Decomposition for Multimodal Data
Murray Cutforth, Tiffany Fan, Tony Zahtila, Alireza Doostan, Eric Darve
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
Multi-fidelity simulation is a widely used strategy to reduce the computational cost of many-query numerical simulation tasks such as uncertainty quantification, design space exploration, and design optimization. The reduced basis approach based on bi-fidelity interpolative decomposition is one such approach, which identifies a reduced basis, along with an interpolation rule in that basis, from low-fidelity samples to approximate the corresponding high-fidelity samples. However, as illustrated in the present study, when the model response is multi-modal and mode occupancy is stochastic, the assumptions underpinning this approach may not hold, thus leading to inaccurate estimates. We introduce the multi-modal interpolative decomposition method using bi-fidelity data, an extension tailored for this use case. Our work is motivated by a complex engineering application: a laser-ignited methane-oxygen rocket combustor evaluated over uncertain input parameters, exhibiting a bifurcation-like phenomenon in some regions of parameter space. Unlike the standard bi-fidelity interpolative decomposition approach, the proposed method can approximate a dataset of high-fidelity simulations for 16\% of the cost, while maintaining relatively high correlation (0.70--0.90) with parameter sensitivities.

Classical Analysis and ODEs (math.CA)
In the present paper, we study the asymptotic properties of the semi-exponential Post-Widder operator. It is connected with $p(x) = x^2$. The main result is a pointwise complete asymptotic expansion valid for locally smooth functions of exponential growth. All coefficients are derived and explicitly given. As a special case we recover the complete asymptotic expansion for the classical Post-Widder operator.

A Variational Physics-Informed Neural Network Framework Using Petrov-Galerkin Method for Solving Singularly Perturbed Boundary Value Problems
Vijay Kumar, Gautam Singh
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)
This work proposes a Variational Physics-Informed Neural Network (VPINN) framework that integrates the Petrov-Galerkin formulation with deep neural networks (DNNs) for solving one-dimensional singularly perturbed boundary value problems (BVPs) and parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) involving one or two small parameters. The method adopts a nonlinear approximation in which the trial space is defined by neural network functions, while the test space is constructed from hat functions. The weak formulation is constructed using localized test functions, with interface penalty terms introduced to enhance numerical stability and accurately capture boundary layers. Dirichlet boundary conditions are imposed via hard constraints, and source terms are computed using automatic differentiation. Numerical experiments on benchmark problems demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing significantly improved accuracy in both the $L_2$ and maximum norms compared to the standard VPINN approach for one-dimensional singularly perturbed differential equations (SPDEs).

The dynamical symmetry breaking associated with the existence and non-existence of breather solutions is studied. Here, nonlinear hyperbolic evolution equations are calculated using a high-precision numerical scheme. %%% First, for clarifying the dynamical symmetry breaking, it is necessary to use a sufficiently high-precision scheme in the time-dependent framework. Second, the error of numerical calculations is generally more easily accumulated for calculating hyperbolic equations rather than parabolic equations. Third, numerical calculations become easily unstable for nonlinear cases. Our strategy for the high-precision and stable scheme is to implement the implicit Runge-Kutta method for time, and the Fourier spectral decomposition for space. %%% In this paper, focusing on the breather solutions, the relationship between the velocity, mass, and the amplitude of the perturbation is clarified. As a result, the conditions for transitioning from one state to another are clarified.

On the Diminished Sombor Index of Fixed-Order Molecular Graphs With Cyclomatic Number at Least 3
Abdulaziz Mutlaq Alotaibi, Abdulaziz M. Alanazi, Taher S. Hassan, Akbar Ali
Comments:
15 pages, 2 figures
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
For a graph $G$ with edge set $E$, let $d(u)$ denote the degree of a vertex $u$ in $G$. The diminished Sombor (DSO) index of $G$ is defined as $DSO(G)=\sum_{uv\in E}\sqrt{(d(u))^2+(d(v))^2}(d(u)+d(v))^{-1}$. The cyclomatic number of a graph is the smallest number of edges whose removal makes the graph acyclic. A connected graph of maximum degree at most $4$ is known as a molecular graph. The primary motivation of the present study comes from a conjecture concerning the minimum DSO index of fixed-order connected graphs with cyclomatic number $3$, posed in the recent paper [F. Movahedi, I. Gutman, I. Redžepović, B. Furtula, Diminished Sombor index, MATCH Commun. Comput. Chem. 95 (2026) 141--162]. The present paper gives all graphs minimizing the DSO index among all molecular graphs of order $n$ with cyclomatic number $\ell$, provided that $n\ge 2(\ell-1)\ge4$.

The Fejér-Dirichlet Lift: Entire Functions and $ζ$-Factorization Identities
Sebastian Fuchs
Comments:
58 pages, 13 figures
Subjects:
General Mathematics (math.GM)
A Fejér-Dirichlet lift is developed that turns divisor information at the integers into entire interpolants with explicit Dirichlet-series factorizations. For absolutely summable weights the lift interpolates $(a*1)(n)$ at each integer $n$ and has Dirichlet series $\zeta(s)A(s)$ on $\Re s>1$. Two applications are emphasized. First, for $q>1$ an entire function $\mathfrak F(\cdot,q)$ is constructed that vanishes at primes and is positive at composite integers; a tangent-matched variant $\mathfrak F^{\sharp}$ is shown to admit an explicit, effective threshold $P_0(q)$ such that for every odd prime $p\ge P_0(q)$ the interval $(p-1,p)$ is free of real zeros and $x=p$ is a boundary zero of multiplicity two. Second, a renormalized lift for $a=\mu*\Lambda$ produces an entire interpolant of $\Lambda(n)$ and provides a constructive viewpoint on the appearance of $\zeta'(s)/\zeta(s)$ through the FD-lift spectrum. A Polylog-Zeta factorization for the geometric-weight case links $\zeta(s)$ with $\operatorname{Li}_s(1/q)$. All prime/composite statements concern integer arguments. Scripts reproducing figures and numerical checks are provided in a public repository with an archival snapshot.

The Green's Function on Rhombic Flat Tori
A. E. D. Castillo, G. A. Lobos, V. Ramos Batista
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
We obtain the Green's function $G$ for any flat rhombic torus $T$, always with numerical values of significant digits up to the fourth decimal place (noting that $G$ is unique for $|T|=1$ and $\int_TGdA=0$). This precision is guaranteed by the strategies we adopt, which include theorems such as the Legendre Relation, properties of the Weierstraß\,P-Function, and also the algorithmic control of numerical errors. Our code uses complex integration routines developed by H. Karcher, who also introduced the symmetric P-Weierstraß\,function, and these resources simplify the computation of elliptic functions considerably.

Polynomials of small slice rank and strength

Subjects:
Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)
This paper investigates defining equations for secant varieties of the variety of reducible polynomials, which geometrically encode the notions of strength and slice rank of homogeneous polynomials. We present three main results. First, we reinterpret Ruppert's classical equations for reducible ternary forms in the language of representation theory and we extend them to an arbitrary number of variables. Second, we construct new determinantal equations for polynomials of small strength based on syzygies of their partial derivatives. Finally, we establish a reduction theorem for cubic forms, proving that slice rank two is determined by generic linear sections in $14$ variables; this gives one of the few explicit upper bounds for defining equations for the image of a polynomial map in the framework of noetherianity for polynomial functors.

Spectra of T-vertex and T-edge neighbourhood corona of Two Graphs
Indranil Mukherjee, Suvra Kanti Chakraborty, Arpita Das
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
The $T$-graph $T(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the graph whose vertices are the vertices and edges of $G$, with two vertices of $T(G)$ are adjacent if and only if the corresponding elements of $G$ are adjacent or incident. In this paper, we determine the adjacency and Laplacian spectra of $T$-vertex neighborhood corona and $T$-edge neighborhood corona of a connected regular graph with an arbitrary regular graph in terms of their eigenvalues. Moreover, applying these results we construct some non-regular $A$-cospectral and $L$-cospectral graphs.

A Riemann-Hilbert Approach to Asymptotic Analysis of Toeplitz+Hankel Determinants II
Roozbeh Gharakhloo, Alexander Its
Comments:
47 pages
Subjects:
Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Classical Analysis and ODEs (math.CA)
In this article, we continue the development of the Riemann-Hilbert formalism for studying the asymptotics of Toeplitz+Hankel determinants with non-identical symbols, which we initiated in \cite{GI}. In \cite{GI}, we showed that the Riemann-Hilbert problem we formulated admits the Deift-Zhou nonlinear steepest descent analysis, but with a special restriction on the winding numbers of the associated symbols. In particular, the most natural case, namely zero winding numbers, is not allowed. A principal goal of this paper is to develop a framework that extends the asymptotic analysis of Toeplitz+Hankel determinants to a broader range of winding-number configurations. As an application, we consider the case in which the winding numbers of the Szegő-type Toeplitz and Hankel symbols are zero and one, respectively, and compute the asymptotics of the norms of the corresponding system of orthogonal polynomials.

Blow-up exponents and a semilinear elliptic equation for the fractional Laplacian on hyperbolic spaces
Tommaso Bruno, Effie Papageorgiou
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
Let $\mathbb{H}^n$ be the $n$-dimensional real hyperbolic space, $\Delta$ its nonnegative Laplace--Beltrami operator whose bottom of the spectrum we denote by $\lambda_{0}$, and $\sigma \in (0,1)$.
The aim of this paper is twofold. On the one hand, we determine the Fujita exponent for the fractional heat equation \[\partial_{t} u + \Delta^{\sigma}u = e^{\beta t}|u|^{\gamma-1}u,\] by proving that nontrivial positive global solutions exist if and only if $\gamma\geq 1 + \beta/ \lambda_{0}^{\sigma}$. On the other hand, we prove the existence of non-negative, bounded and finite energy solutions of the semilinear fractional elliptic equation \[
\Delta^{\sigma} v - \lambda^{\sigma} v - v^{\gamma}=0 \] for $0\leq \lambda \leq \lambda_{0}$ and $1<\gamma< \frac{n+2\sigma}{n-2\sigma}$. The two problems are known to be connected and the latter, aside from its independent interest, is actually instrumental to the former.
\smallskip
At the core of our results stands a novel fractional Poincaré-type inequality expressed in terms of a new scale of $L^{2}$ fractional Sobolev spaces, which sharpens those known so far, and which holds more generally on Riemannian symmetric spaces of non-compact type. We also establish an associated Rellich--Kondrachov-like compact embedding theorem for radial functions, along with other related properties.

Toroidal Cartesian Products Where One Factor is 3-Connected
Elizabeth Badgett, Christian Millichap
Comments:
20 pages, 5 figures
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
In this paper, we provide a partial classification of Cartesian products of graphs that embed on the torus where one factor is $3$-connected. We show that if $G \square H$ embeds on the torus and $G$ is $3$-connected, then $H$ must be a path on two vertices, $P_2$, and we provide significant evidence that $G$ must be outer-cylindrical. At the same time, we show that if $G$ is outer-cylindrical, then $G \square P_2$ embeds on the torus. This all leads us to conjecture that if $G$ is $3$-connected then $G \square H$ embeds on the torus if and only if $G$ is outer-cylindrical and $H = P_2$. We also determine the genera of $K_{4} \square P_{3}$ and $H_i \square P_2$ where $H_i$ is a planar, $3$-connected, non-outer-cylindrical graph derived from a wheel graph $W_i$ via two vertex splits and one edge addition.

Jackknife Variance Estimation for Hájek-Dominated Generalized U-Statistics
Jakob R. Juergens
Subjects:
Statistics Theory (math.ST); Machine Learning (stat.ML)
We prove ratio-consistency of the jackknife variance estimator, and certain variants, for a broad class of generalized U-statistics whose variance is asymptotically dominated by their Hájek projection, with the classical fixed-order case recovered as a special instance. This Hájek projection dominance condition unifies and generalizes several criteria in the existing literature, placing the simple nonparametric jackknife on the same footing as the infinitesimal jackknife in the generalized setting. As an illustration, we apply our result to the two-scale distributional nearest-neighbor regression estimator, obtaining consistent variance estimates under substantially weaker conditions than previously required.

We study natural one-parameter families of antiholomorphic correspondences arising from univalent restrictions of Shabat polynomials, indexed by rooted dessin d'enfants. We prove that the parameter spaces are topological quadrilaterals, giving a partial description of the univalency loci for the uniformizing Shabat polynomials. We show that the escape loci of our parameter spaces are naturally (real-analytically) uniformized by disks. We proceed with designing a puzzle structure (dual to the indexing dessin) for non-renormalizable maps, yielding combinatorial rigidity in these this http URL we develop a renormalization theory for pinched (anti-)polynomial-like maps in order to describe all combinatorial Multibrot and Multicorn copies contained in our connectedness loci (a curious feature of these parameter spaces is the presence of multiple period one copies). Finally, we construct locally connected combinatorial models for the connectedness loci into which the indexing dessins naturally embed.

We give a new proof of the deletion-contraction relation on hypertoric Hitchin systems of Dansco-Mcbreen-Shende and present some refinements of it. The end result is a formula for the Poincaré polynomial of any hypertoric Hitchin system associated to a graph with first Betti number 2 along with a recipe to calculate the Poincaré polynomial of any hypertoric Hitchin system, given knowledge of a finite number of base cases.

Multiview ideals arise from the geometry of image formation in pinhole cameras, and universal multiview ideals are their analogs for unknown cameras. We prove that a natural collection of polynomials form a universal Gröbner basis for both types of ideals using a criterion introduced by Huang and Larson, and include a proof of their criterion in our setting. Symmetry reduction and induction enable the method to be deployed on an infinite family of ideals. We also give an explicit description of the matroids on which the methodology depends, in the context of multiview ideals.

Rates of convergence for multivariate SDEs driven by Lévy processes in the small-time stable domain of attraction

Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
This paper explores the rates of convergence of solutions for multivariate stochastic differential equations (SDEs) driven by Lévy processes within the small-time stable domain of attraction (DoA). Explicit bounds are derived for the uniform Wasserstein distance between solutions of two Lévy-driven SDEs, expressed in terms of driver characteristics. These bounds establish convergence rates in probability for drivers in the DoA, and yield uniform Wasserstein distance convergence for SDEs with additive noise. The methodology uses two couplings for Lévy driver jump components, leading to sharp convergence rates tied to the processes' intrinsic properties.

Data-driven balanced truncation for linear systems with quadratic outputs

Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA); Dynamical Systems (math.DS)
We develop the framework for a non-intrusive, quadrature-based method for approximate balanced truncation (QuadBT) of linear systems with quadratic outputs, thus extending the applicability of QuadBT, which was originally designed for data-driven balanced truncation of standard linear systems with linear outputs only. The new approach makes use of the time-domain and frequency-domain quadrature-based representation of the system's infinite Gramians, only implicitly. We show that by sampling solely the extended impulse responses of the original system and their derivatives (or the corresponding transfer functions), we construct a reduced-order model that mimics the approximation quality of the intrusive (projection-based) balanced truncation. We validate the proposed framework on a numerical example.

A new approach to (3+1)-dimensional TQFTs via topological modular forms

In this paper, we present a construction toward a new type of TQFTs at the crossroads of low-dimensional topology, algebraic geometry, physics, and homotopy theory. It assigns TMF-modules to closed 3-manifolds and maps of TMF-modules to 4-dimensional cobordisms. This is a mathematical proposal for one of the simplest examples in a family of ${\pi}_*({\rm TMF})$-valued invariants of 4-manifolds which are expected to arise from 6-dimensional superconformal field theories. As part of the construction, we define TMF-modules associated with symmetric bilinear forms, using (spectral) derived algebraic geometry. The invariant of unimodular bilinear forms takes values in ${\pi}_*({\rm TMF})$, conjecturally generalizing the theta function of a lattice. We discuss gluing properties of the invariants. We also demonstrate some interesting physics applications of the TMF-modules such as distinguishing phases of quantum field theories in various dimensions.

Spectra of random graphs with discrete scale invariance

Subjects:
Spectral Theory (math.SP); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
Random graphs defined by an occurrence probability that is invariant under node aggregation have been identified recently in the context of network renormalization. The invariance property requires that edges are drawn with a specific probability that, in the annealed case, depends on a necessarily infinite-mean node fitness. The diverging mean determines many properties that are uncommon in models with independent edges, but at the same time widespread in real-world networks. Here we focus on the leading eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix of the model, where the n nodes are assigned a Pareto($\alpha$)-distributed fitness with 0 < $\alpha$ < 1. We find that the leading eigenvalues are all of order square root of n, alternate in sign and are located at the intersection between the real axis and a logarithmic spiral in the complex plane, which we characterize analytically in terms of the Gamma function. We also calculate the associated eigenvectors, finding that they display complexvalued scaling exponents and log-periodicity, which are signatures of discrete scale invariance. In contrast with the typical finite-rank behaviour of random graphs with finite-mean variables, we find that a growing number of the leading eigenvalues emerges from the bulk, whose edge extends up to order square root of n and therefore reaches the same scale as that of the structural eigenvalues.

Subjects:

We formulate a cell-scale model for the degradation of the extra-cellular matrix by membrane-bound and soluble matrix degrading enzymes produced by cancer cells. Based on the microscopic model and using tools from the theory of homogenisation we propose a macroscopic model for cancer cell invasion into the extra-cellular matrix mediated by bound and soluble matrix degrading enzymes. For suitable and biologically relevant initial data we prove the macroscopic model is well-posed. We propose a finite element method for the numerical approximation of the macroscopic model and report on simulation results illustrating the role of the bound and soluble enzymes in cancer invasion processes.

Quantitative Scattering for the Energy-Critical Wave Equation on Asymptotically Flat Spacetimes
Benjamin Dodson, Shi-Zhuo Looi

Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
The scattering theory for the energy-critical wave equation on asymptotically flat spacetimes has, to date, been qualitative. While the qualitative scattering of solutions is well-understood, explicit bounds on the solution's global spacetime norms have been unavailable in this geometric setting.
This paper establishes an explicit, exponential-type global bound on the Strichartz norm $\| u\|_{L^8_{t,x}}$ for solutions to the defocusing equation $\Box_g u=u^5$, where $\Box_g$ is the d'Alembertian associated with the perturbed metric. The bound depends on the solution's energy and an \textit{a priori} $\dot H^5 \times \dot H^4$ regularity bound on the solution.
The proof develops a strategy that bypasses the need for vector-field commutators. It combines an interaction Morawetz estimate adapted to variable coefficients to control the solution's recent history with a dispersive analysis founded on integrated local energy decay to control the remote past. This strategy, in turn, necessitates the regularity and specific decay assumptions on the metric.
As a result, this work upgrades the existing qualitative scattering theory to a fully quantitative statement, which provides a concrete measure of the global behavior of solutions in this geometric setting.

Augmentations, reduced ideal point gluings and compact type degenerations of curves

Subjects:
Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)
In this note we demonstrate some unexpected properties that simple gluings of the simplest derived categories may have. We consider two special cases: the first is an augmented curve, i.e., the gluing of the derived categories of a point and a curve with the gluing bimodule given by the structure sheaf of the curve; the second is an ideal point gluing of curves, i.e., the gluing of the derived categories of two curves with the gluing bimodule given by the ideal sheaf of a point in the product of the curves. We construct unexpected exceptional objects contained in these categories and discuss their orthogonal complements.
We also show that the simplest example of compact type degeneration of curves, a flat family of curves with a smooth general fiber and a 1-nodal reducible central fiber, gives rise to a smooth and proper family of triangulated categories with the general fiber an augmented curve and the central fiber the orthogonal complement of the exotic exceptional object in the ideal point gluing of curves, called the reduced ideal point gluing of curves.

We consider the three-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in a bounded domain with Navier boundary conditions. We provide a sufficient condition for the absence of anomalous energy dissipation without making assumptions on the behaviour of the corresponding pressure near the boundary or the existence of a strong solution to the incompressible Euler equations with the same initial data. We establish our result by using our recent regularity results for the pressure corresponding to weak solutions of the incompressible Euler equations [Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal., 249 (2025), 28].

Nonlinear stability of the Larson-Penston collapse

Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
We prove nonlinear stability of the Larson-Penston family of self-similarly collapsing solutions to the isothermal Euler-Poisson system. Our result applies to radially symmetric perturbations and it is the first full nonlinear stability result for radially imploding compressible flows. At the heart of the proof is the ground state character of the Larson-Penston solution, which exhibits important global monotonicity properties used throughout the proof.
One of the key challenges is the proof of mode-stability for the non self-adjoint spectral problem which arises when linearising the dynamics around the Larson-Penston collapsing solution. To exclude the presence of complex growing modes other than the trivial one associated with time translation symmetry, we use a high-order energy method in low and high frequency regimes, for which the monotonicity properties are crucially exploited, and use rigorous computer-assisted techniques in the intermediate regime. In addition, the maximal dissipativity of the linearised operator is proven on arbitrary large backward light cones emanating from the singular point using the global monotonicity of the Larson-Penston solutions. Such a flexibility in linear analysis also facilitates nonlinear analysis and allows us to identify the exact number of derivatives necessary for the nonlinear stability statement. The proof is based on a two-tier high-order weighted energy method which ties bounds derived from the Duhamel formula to quasilinear top order estimates. To prove global existence we further use the Brouwer fixed point theorem to identify the final collapse time, which suppresses the trivial instability caused by the time-translation symmetry of the system.

Exploring the entropic region
Laszlo Csirmaz
Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT)
The paper explores three known methods, their variants and limitations, that can be used to obtain new entropy inequalities. The Copy Lemma was distilled from the original Zhang-Yeung construction which produced the first non-Shannon inequality. Its iterated version, effects of symmetrizations, and connections with polyhedral vertex enumeration are discussed. Another method, derived from the principle of maximum entropy, has the Copy Lemma as a special case. Nevertheless, none of the two presented variants is known to generate more inequalities than the iterated Copy Lemma. Finally, the Ahlswede-Körner method is shown to employ a hidden application of the Copy Lemma - the underlying lemma alone cannot generate new inequalities -, which makes this method strictly weaker than the Copy Lemma. The paper is written in a tutorial style and concludes with a list of open questions and research problems.

Szegő's theorem for Jordan arcs
Benedikt Buchecker
Subjects:
Classical Analysis and ODEs (math.CA)
The $n$-th Christoffel function for a point $z_0\in\mathbb C$ and a finite measure $\mu$ supported on a Jordan arc $\Gamma$ is \[ \lambda_n(\mu,z_0)=\inf\left\{\int_\Gamma |P|^2d\mu\mid P\text{ is a polynomial of degree at most }n\text{ and } P(z_0)=1\right\}. \] It is natural to extend this notion to $z_0=\infty$ and define $\lambda_n(\mu,\infty)$ to be the infimum of the squared $L^2(\mu)$-norm over monic polynomials of degree $n$. The classical Szegő theorem provides an asymptotic description of $\lambda_n(\mu,z_0)$ for $|z_0|>1$ and $z_0=\infty$ and arbitrary finite measures supported on the unit circle. Widom has proved a version of Szegő's theorem for measures supported on $C^{2+}$-Jordan arcs for the point $z_0=\infty$ and purely absolutely continuous measures belonging to the Szegő class. We extend this result in two directions. We prove explicit asymptotics of $\lambda_n(\mu,z_0)$ for any finite measure $\mu$ supported on a $C^{1+}$-Jordan arc $\Gamma$, and for all points $z_0\in\mathbb{C}\cup\{\infty\}\setminus\Gamma$. Moreover, if the measure is in the Szegő class, we provide explicit asymptotics for the extremal and orthogonal polynomials.

The Torelli map $t\colon \mathcal{M}^{ct}_g \to \mathcal{A}_g$ is far from an immersion for $g\geq 3$: the self-fiber product of the Torelli map for $g\geq 3$ has several components with nontrivial intersections. We give a stratification of the self-fiber product for arbitrary genus and describe how components in the fiber product intersect. In genus $4$, the Torelli fiber product is nonreduced, which we prove by analyzing the expansion of the period map near a nodal curve. We use the geometry of the Torelli fiber product to: Calculate the class of the pullback to $\mathcal{M}^{ct}_4$ of the Torelli cycle $t_*[\mathcal{M}^{ct}_4]$ on $\mathcal{A}_4$; Find the class $t_*[\overline{\mathcal{M}}_4]$ for suitable toroidal compactifications $\overline{\mathcal{A}}_4$; Calculate the class $t^*t_*[\mathcal{M}^{ct}_5]|_{\mathcal{M}_5}$. In the first appendix, we write down a calculation for finding the Chern classes of $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}$. In the second, we give a formula for a coefficient occurring in an intersection of excess dimension.

Effects of temporal variations on wave speeds of bistable traveling waves for Lotka-Volterra competition systems
Weiwei Ding, Zhanghua Liang
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
This paper investigates the bistable traveling waves for two-species Lotka-Volterra competition systems in time periodic environments. We focus especially on the influence of the temporal period, with existence results established for both small and large this http URL also show the existence of, and derive explicit formulas for, the limiting speeds as the period tends to zero or infinity, and provide estimates for the corresponding rates of convergence. Furthermore, we analyze the sign of wave speed. Assuming that both species share identical diffusion rates and intraspecific competition rates, we obtain a criterion for determining the sign of wave speed by comparing the intrinsic growth rates and interspecific competition strengths. More intriguingly, based on our explicit formulas for the limiting speeds, we construct an example in which the sign of wave speed changes with the temporal period. This example reveals that temporal variations can significantly influence competition outcomes,enabling different species to become dominant under different periods.

Bounds on bending in terms of the Schwartzian derivative and Teichmüller distance

Locally-univalent maps $f: \Delta \rightarrow \hat{\mathbb{C}}$ can be parametrized by their Schwartzian derivatives $Sf$, a quadratic differential whose norm $\|Sf\|_\infty$ measures how close $f$ is to being Möbius. In particular, by Nehari, if $\|Sf\|_\infty < 1/2$ then $f$ is univalent and if $f$ is univalent then $\|Sf\|_\infty < 3/2$. Thurston gave another parametrization associating to $f$ a bending measured lamination $\beta_f$ which has a natural norm $\|\beta_f\|_L$. In this paper, we give an explicit bound on $\|\beta_f\|_L$ as a function of $\|Sf\|_\infty$ for $\|Sf\|_\infty < 1/2$. One application is a bound on the bending measured lamination of a quasifuchsian group in terms of the Teichmuller distance between the conformal structures on the two components of the conformal boundary.

Scattering theory for Stokes flow in complex branched structures

Numerical Analysis (math.NA); Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
Slow, viscous flow in branched structures arises in many biological and engineering settings. Direct numerical simulation of flow in such complicated multi-scale geometry, however, is a computationally intensive task. We propose a scattering theory framework that dramatically reduces this cost by decomposing networks into components connected by short straight channels. Exploiting the phenomenon of rapid return to Poiseuille flow (Saint-Venant's principle in the context of elasticity), we compute a high-order accurate scattering matrix for each component via boundary integral equations. These precomputed components can then be assembled into arbitrary branched structures, and the precomputed local solutions on each component can be assembled into an accurate global solution. The method is modular, has negligible cost, and appears to be the first full-fidelity solver that makes use of the return to Poiseuille flow phenomenon. In our two-dimensional examples, it matches the accuracy of full-domain solvers while requiring only a fraction of the computational effort.

Also, denote by $\mathcal{B}$ any smallest irredundant subfamily of $\mathcal{A}_{<n/2}$ such that $b(\mathcal{B})=b(\mathcal{A}_{<n/2})$. We prove that if $\mathcal{A}$ is separating with height $h = 4 \leq n$ and $0 \leq |\mathcal{B}| \leq 2$, then the average size of a member set from $\mathcal{A}$ is at least $n/2$. We show that $h=4$ is greatest possible with respect to this result, and conclude by considering the remaining domain $3 \leq |\mathcal{B}| \leq 4$.

An efficient splitting iteration for a CDA-accelerated solver for incompressible flow problems
Victoria L. Fisher, Leo G. Rebholz, Duygu Vargun
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
We propose, analyze, and test an efficient splitting iteration for solving the incompressible, steady Navier-Stokes equations in the setting where partial solution data is known. The (possibly noisy) solution data is incorporated into a Picard-type solver via continuous data assimilation (CDA). Efficiency is gained over the usual Picard iteration through an algebraic splitting of Yosida-type that produces easier linear solves, and accuracy/consistency is shown to be maintained through the use of an incremental pressure and grad-div stabilization. We prove that CDA scales the Lipschitz constant of the associated fixed point operator by $H^{1/2}$, where $H$ is the characteristic spacing of the known solution data. This implies that CDA accelerates an already converging solver (and the more data, the more acceleration) and enables convergence of solvers in parameter regimes where the solver would fail (and the more data, the larger the parameter regime). Numerical tests illustrate the theory on several benchmark test problems and show that the proposed efficient solver gives nearly identical results in terms of number of iterations to converge; in other words, the proposed solver gives an efficiency gain with no loss in convergence rate.

In this paper, we introduce an immersed $C^0$ interior penalty method for solving two-dimensional biharmonic interface problems on unfitted meshes. To accommodate the biharmonic interface conditions, high-order immersed finite element (IFE) spaces are constructed in the least-squares sense. We establish key properties of these spaces including unisolvency and partition of unity are, and verify their optimal approximation capability. These spaces are further incorporated into a modified $C^0$ interior penalty scheme with additional penalty terms on interface segments. The well-posedness of the discrete solution is proved. Numerical experiments with various interface geometries confirm optimal convergence of the proposed method in $L^2$, $H^1$ and $H^2$ norms.

A proper coloring $\phi$ of $G$ is called a proper conflict-free coloring of $G$ if for every non-isolated vertex $v$ of $G$, there is a color $c$ such that $|\phi^{-1}(c)\cap N_G(v)|=1$. As an analogy of degree-choosability of graphs, we introduced the notion of proper conflict-free $({\rm degree}+k)$-choosability of graphs. For a non-negative integer $k$, a graph $G$ is proper conflict-free $({\rm degree}+k)$-choosable if for any list assignment $L$ of $G$ with $|L(v)|\geq d_G(v)+k$ for every vertex $v\in V(G)$, $G$ admits a proper conflict-free coloring $\phi$ such that $\phi(v)\in L(v)$ for every vertex $v\in V(G)$. In this note, we first remark if a graph $G$ is $d$-degenerate, then $G$ is proper conflict-free $({\rm degree}+d+1)$-choosable. Furthermore, when $d=1$, we can reduce the number of colors by showing that every tree is proper conflict-free $({\rm degree}+1)$-choosable. This motivates us to state a question.

Sharp lower bounds and extremal graphs for the generalized $k$-independence number

Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
A vertex set $S$ is a generalized $k$-independent set if the induced subgraph $G[S]$ contains no tree on $k$ vertices. The generalized $k$-independence number $\alpha_k(G)$ is the maximum size of such a set. For a tree $T$ with $n$ vertices, Bock et al. [J. Graph Theory 103 (2023) 661-673] and Li et al. [Taiwanese J. Math. 27 (2023) 647-683] independently showed that $\alpha_3(G)\geq \frac{2}{3}n$ and identified the extremal trees that attain this lower bound. Subsequently, Li and Zhou [Appl. Math. Comput. 484 (2025) 129018] established that $\alpha_4(T) \geq \frac{3}{4}n$ and they further characterized all trees achieving this bound. This result was recently extended by Huang, who proved that $\alpha_4(G)\geq \frac{3}{4}(n-\omega(G))$ holds for every $n$-vertex graph, where $\omega(G)$ denotes the dimension of the cycle space of $G.$ The extremal graphs attaining this lower bound were also fully characterized. Based on these findings, Huang proposed a conjecture concerning a lower bound for $\alpha_k(G)\ (k\geq2)$ together with the corresponding extremal graphs, which naturally generalizes all the aforementioned results. In this paper, we confirm this conjecture here. We further quantify strict improvements over this bound when the equality conditions fail, and we provide a linear-time algorithm that constructs a generalized \(k\)-independent set of size at least \(\left\lceil\frac{k-1}{k}\left(n-\omega(G)\right)\right\rceil\).

We develop sharp bounds on the statistical distance between high-dimensional permutation mixtures and their i.i.d. counterparts. Our approach establishes a new geometric link between the spectrum of a complex channel overlap matrix and the information geometry of the channel, yielding tight dimension-independent bounds that close gaps left by previous work. Within this geometric framework, we also derive dimension-dependent bounds that uncover phase transitions in dimensionality for Gaussian and Poisson families. Applied to compound decision problems, this refined control of permutation mixtures enables sharper mean-field analyses of permutation-invariant decision rules, yielding strong non-asymptotic equivalence results between two notions of compound regret in Gaussian and Poisson models.

Channel Estimation for Rydberg Atomic Quantum Receivers

Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT)
The advent of Rydberg atomic quantum receivers (RAQRs) offers a new solution for the evolution of wireless transceiver architecture, promising unprecedented sensitivity and immunity to thermal noise. However, RAQRs introduce a unique non-linear signal model based on biased phase retrieval, which complicates fundamental channel estimation tasks. Traditional iterative algorithms often struggle in low signal-to-noise regimes and fail to capture complex and non-ideal system characteristics. To address this, we propose a novel model-driven deep learning framework for channel estimation in RAQRs. Specifically, we propose a Transformer-based unrolling architecture, termed URformer, which is derived by unrolling a stabilized variant of the expectation-maximization Gerchberg-Saxton (EM-GS) algorithm. Specifically, each layer of the proposed URformer incorporates three trainable modules: 1) a learnable filter implemented by a neural network that replaces the fixed Bessel function ratio in the classic EM-GS algorithm; 2) a trainable gating mechanism that adaptively combines classic and model-based updates to ensure training stability; and 3) a efficient channel Transformer block that learns to correct residual errors by capturing non-local dependencies across the channel matrix. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed URformer significantly outperforms classic iterative algorithms and conventional black-box neural networks with less pilot overhead.

The Insertion Chain Complex: A Topological Approach to the Structure of Word Sets
Nataša Jonoska, Francisco Martinez-Figueroa, Masahico Saito
Comments:
37 pages and an Appendix. Code and computations at: this https URL
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO); Algebraic Topology (math.AT)
We introduce the Insertion Chain Complex, a higher-dimensional extension of insertion graphs, as a new framework for analyzing finite sets of words. We study its topological and combinatorial properties, in particular its homology groups, as measures of the complexity for word sets. After establishing its theoretical foundations, we investigate the computational and combinatorial aspects of these complexes. Among other results, we classify minimal 1-dimensional cycles and prove that every finitely generated abelian group can be realized as the homology of the insertion complex for some set of words. We also identify conditions that guarantee vanishing homology. These results provide new invariants for characterizing finite sets of words through word-based topological structures and their properties.

Randomized Feasibility-Update Algorithms for Stochastic Variational Inequality Problems
Abhishek Chakraborty, Angelia Nedić
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
This paper considers stochastic monotone variational inequalities whose feasible region is the intersection of a (possibly infinite) number of convex functional level sets. A projection-based approach or direct Lagrangian-based techniques for such problems can be computationally expensive if not impossible to implement. To deal with the problem, we consider randomized methods that avoid the projection step on the whole constraint set by employing random feasibility updates. In particular, we propose and analyze modified stochastic Korpelevich and Popov methods for solving monotone stochastic VIs. We introduce a modified dual gap function and prove the convergence rates with respect to this function. We illustrate the performance of the methods in simulations on a zero-sum matrix game.

Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
In this paper, we study the three-dimensional axisymmetric compressible Navier-Stokes equations with slip boundary conditions in a cylindrical domain excluding the axis. We establish the global existence and exponential decay of weak, strong, and classical solutions with large initial data and vacuum, under the assumption that the bulk viscosity coefficient is sufficiently large. Moreover, we demonstrate that as the bulk viscosity coefficient tends to infinity, the solutions of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations converge to those of the inhomogeneous incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.

Ill-posedness in $B^s_{p,\infty}$ of the Euler equations: Non-continuous dependence
Jinlu Li, Yanghai Yu
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
In this paper, we solve an open problem left in the monographs \cite[Bahouri-Chemin-Danchin, (2011)]{BCD}. Precisely speaking, it was obtained in \cite[Theorem 7.1 on pp293, (2011)]{BCD} the existence and uniqueness of $B^s_{p,\infty}$ solution for the Euler equations. We furthermore prove that the solution map of the Euler equation is not continuous in the Besov spaces from $B^s_{p,\infty}$ to $L_T^\infty B^s_{p,\infty}$ for $s>1+d/p$ with $1\leq p\leq \infty$ and in the Hölder spaces from $C^{k,\alpha}$ to $L_T^\infty C^{k,\alpha}$ with $k\in \mathbb{N}^+$ and $\alpha\in(0,1)$, which later covers particularly the ill-posedness of $C^{1,\alpha}$ solution in \cite[Trans. Amer. Math. Soc., (2018)]{MYtams}. Beyond purely technical aspects on the choice of initial data, a remarkable novelty of the proof is the construction of an approximate solution to the Burgers equation.

An Optimization Framework for the Time-Dependent Electric Vehicle Routing Problem with Shared Mobility: A Step Toward Smart Cities
Alireza Yazdiani, Shayan Bafandkar, Amir Elmi, Yousef Shafahi
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
This paper aims to introduce a mathematical model to solve the time-dependent electric vehicles routing problem in shared travels. Shared mobility has gained significance recently due to its contribution to the alleviation of traffic congestion and air pollution. In this study, a MIP model has been developed and solved for a toy problem using the CPLEX solver to indicate the efficiency of shared mobility compared to private mode. We have considered practical constraints, such as considering the traffic congestion throughout the day by assigning a time-dependent step function to the network's links altering travel times in the peak and off-peak hours, nonlinear charging function, vehicles' queue at charging stations, partial charging possibility, different charging infrastructures, and passengers' desired timewindows, to make the results of the model more applicable in the real world. Among the important results of this presented model according to the solved example, we can mention the reduction of mileage per vehicle in personal mode from 56.42 km to 46.83 km in shared mode while the total travel time per vehicle has only increased slightly from 84.63 min/veh to 89.32 min/veh, respectively. This suggests that the typical problems related to private travel can be offset by shared travel without losing the comfort and convenience of the former.

Tricyclic graphs for which the second largest distance eigenvalue less than $-\frac{1}{2}$
Kexin Yang, Ligong Wang
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
Let $G$ be a simple connected graph with vertex set $V(G)=\{v_{1}, v_{2}, \ldots, v_{n}\}$. The distance $d_G(v_i,v_j)$ between two vertices $v_i$ and $v_j$ of $G$ is the length of a shortest path between $v_i$ and $v_j$. The distance matrix of $G$ is defined as $D(G)=(d_G(v_i,v_j))_{n\times n}$. The second largest distance eigenvalue of \( G \) is the second largest eigenvalues of $D(G)$. Guo and Zhou [Discrete Math. 347(2024), 114082] proved that any connected graph with the second largest distance eigenvalue less than $-\frac{1}{2}$ is chordal, and characterize all bicyclic graphs and split graphs with the second largest distance eigenvalue less than $-\frac{1}{2}$. Based on this, we characterize all tricyclic graphs with the second largest distance eigenvalue less than $-\frac{1}{2}$.

Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
This paper presents an adaptive air transit network leveraging modular aerial pods and artificial intelligence (AI) to address urban mobility challenges. Passenger demand, forecasted from AI models, serves as input parameters for a Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) optimization model that dynamically adjusts pod dispatch schedules and train lengths in response to demand variations. The results reveal a complex interplay of factors, including demand levels, headway bounds, train configurations, and fleet sizes, which collectively influence network performance and service quality. The proposed system demonstrates the importance of dynamic adjustments, where modularity mitigates capacity bottlenecks and improves operational efficiency. Additionally, the framework enhances energy efficiency and optimizes resource utilization through flexible and adaptive scheduling. This framework provides a foundation for a responsive and sustainable urban air mobility solution, supporting the shift from static planning to agile, data-driven operations.

Labelled growth rates of $ω$-categorical structures and applications in choiceless set theory

Subjects:
Logic (math.LO); Combinatorics (math.CO)
We study the labelled growth rate of an $\omega$-categorical structure $\fa$, i.e., the number of orbits of $Aut(\fa)$ on $n$-tuples of distinct elements, and show that the model-theoretic property of monadic stability yields a gap in the spectrum of allowable labelled growth rates. As a further application, we obtain gap in the spectrum of allowable labelled growth rates in hereditary graph classes, with no a priori assumption of $\omega$-categoricity. We also establish a way to translate results about labelled growth rates of $\omega$-categorical structures into combinatorial statements about sets with weak finiteness properties in the absence of the axiom of choice, and derive several results from this translation.

For the finite ordered sets $A, D$, write $A^D$ for the ordered set of isotone maps $D \to A$ with the pointwise order. It was proved in earlier work that the order structure of $A^A$ determines~$A$ up to isomorphism. In this note we extend the result to higher function ordered sets such as $A^{(A^A)}$ and $(A^A)^A$. Our main theorem shows that the structure of $A^D$ determines~$A$.

Moreover, we show that several Information Theoretic perspectives on TDA can often be recovered through the lens of Finsler geometry.

Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)
In this paper, we study a latticized optimization problem with fuzzy relational inequality constraints where the feasible region is formed as the intersection of two inequality fuzzy systems and Sugeno-Weber family of t-norms is considered as fuzzy composition. Sugeno-Weber family of t-norms and t-conorms is one of the most applied one in various fuzzy modelling problems. This family of t-norms and t-conorms was suggested by Weber for modeling intersection and union of fuzzy sets. Also, the t-conorms were suggested as addition rules by Sugeno for so-called alpha-fuzzy measures. The resolution of the feasible region of the problem is firstly investigated when it is defined with max-Sugeno-Weber composition and a necessary and sufficient condition is presented for determining the feasibility. Then, based on some theoretical properties of the problem, an algorithm is presented for solving this nonlinear problem. It is proved that the algorithm can find the exact optimal solution and an example is presented to illustrate the proposed algorithm.

Various threshold effects are investigated on a discrete quasi-1D scattering system. In particular, one of these effects is to add corrections to Levinson's theorem. We explain how these corrections are due to the opening or to the closing of channels of scattering, and how these contributions can be computed as partial winding numbers on newly introduced operators. Embedded thresholds, thresholds associated with changes of spectral multiplicity, and doubly degenerate thresholds are exhibited and analyzed. Most of the investigations are of an analytical nature, but the final equalities rely on a C*-algebraic framework.

A map is bi-orientable if it admits an assignment of local orientations to its vertices such that for every edge, the local orientations at its two endpoints are opposite. Such an assignment is called a bi-orientation of the map. A bi-orientable map is bi-rotary if its automorphism group contains an arc-regular subgroup that preserves the bi-orientation. In this paper, we characterize the automorphism group structure of bi-rotary maps whose Euler characteristic is a negative prime power.

Loss-aware distributionally robust optimization via trainable optimal transport ambiguity sets

Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC); Systems and Control (eess.SY)
Optimal-Transport Distributionally Robust Optimization (OT-DRO) robustifies data-driven decision-making under uncertainty by capturing the sampling-induced statistical error via optimal transport ambiguity sets. The standard OT-DRO pipeline consists of a two-step procedure, where the ambiguity set is first designed and subsequently embedded into the downstream OT-DRO problem. However, this separation between uncertainty quantification and optimization might result in excessive conservatism. We introduce an end-to-end pipeline to automatically learn decision-focused ambiguity sets for OT-DRO problems, where the loss function informs the shape of the optimal transport ambiguity set, leading to less conservative yet distributionally robust decisions. We formulate the learning problem as a bilevel optimization program and solve it via a hypergradient-based method. By leveraging the recently introduced nonsmooth conservative implicit function theorem, we establish convergence to a critical point of the bilevel problem. We present experiments validating our method on standard portfolio optimization and linear regression tasks.

Differentiable by Design Nonlinear Optimization and its application to Model Predictive Control

Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC); Systems and Control (eess.SY)
Nonlinear optimization-based policies have seen large success in recent years, primarily due to the incredible capabilities of nonlinear Model Predictive Control (nMPC). These policies require solving computationally demanding nonlinear optimization programs (NLP) online at each time-step. The solution map of these NLPs, viewed as a function of the measured state of the system and design parameters, may not be differentiable, which poses significant challenges if the policy is designed with a policy optimization scheme. In this paper, we propose a principled way to regularize NLPs to obtain a surrogate derivative even if the NLP is not differentiable. The surrogate problem is differentiable by design and its solution map coincides with the solution of the unregularized problem. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in a free-final-time optimal control problem and a receding-horizon nonlinear MPC example.

Twisted Gabidulin codes are an extension of Gabidulin codes and have recently attracted great attention. In this paper, we study three classes of twisted Gabidulin codes with different twists. Moreover, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for them to be maximum rank distance (MRD) codes, determine the conditions under which they are not MRD codes, and construct several classes of MRD codes via twisted Gabidulin codes. In addition, considering these codes in the Hamming metric, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for them to be maximum distance separable (MDS), almost MDS, or near MDS. Finally, we investigate the covering radii and deep holes of twisted Gabidulin codes.

Deterministic polynomial factorisation modulo many primes

Designing a deterministic polynomial time algorithm for factoring univariate polynomials over finite fields remains a notorious open problem. In this paper, we present an unconditional deterministic algorithm that takes as input an irreducible polynomial $f \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$, and computes the factorisation of its reductions modulo $p$ for all primes $p$ up to a prescribed bound $N$. The \emph{average running time per prime} is polynomial in the size of the input and the degree of the splitting field of $f$ over $\mathbb{Q}$. In particular, if $f$ is Galois, we succeed in factoring in (amortised) deterministic polynomial time.

Starting from the Weierstrass elliptic function, we study the associated Frobenius structure, incorporating the perspective of derived categories, particularly that of homological mirror symmetry. Given a deformation of the Weierstrass elliptic function, we construct a primitive form normalized to be compatible with the period map for integral cycles, and obtain a Frobenius structure whose Frobenius potential is defined over the rational numbers. We also construct a Frobenius structure using elliptic Weyl group invariants (as opposed to Jacobi group invariants), and establish an isomorphism between these two Frobenius structures. We further examine the relationship between the degree of the Lyashko--Looijenga map modulo the modular group and the number of full exceptional collections up to the braid group action and translations, as well as the associated Gamma-integral structure.

Stoimenow matchings avoiding multiple Catalan patterns simultaneously
Shuzhen Lv, Sergey Kitaev
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
Motivated by Vassiliev's knot invariants, Stoimenow introduced a special class of matchings, now known as Stoimenow matchings. These matchings have since been linked to various combinatorial structures enumerated by the Fishburn numbers. In a recent paper, a problem posed by Bevan et al. was addressed concerning the identification of subsets of Stoimenow matchings counted by the Catalan numbers. Five such subsets were presented, each defined by the avoidance of a single pattern, referred to as a Catalan pattern, within Stoimenow matchings.
In the present paper, we extend this line of research by enumerating all cases of simultaneous avoidance of sets of Catalan patterns in Stoimenow matchings. This comprehensive analysis reveals connections to nine integer sequences listed in the OEIS.

A Statistical Test for Comparing the Linkage and Admixture Model Based on Central Limit Theorems
Carola Sophia Heinzel
Subjects:
Statistics Theory (math.ST)
In the Admixture Model, the probability that an individual carries a certain allele at a specific marker depends on the allele frequencies in $K$ ancestral populations and the proportion of the individual's genome originating from these populations. The markers are assumed to be independent. The Linkage Model is a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) that extends the Admixture Model by incorporating linkage between neighboring loci.
This study investigates the consistency and central limit behavior of maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) for individual ancestry in the Linkage Model, complementing earlier results by \citep{pfaff2004information, pfaffelhuber2022central, heinzel2025consistency} for the Admixture Model. These theoretical results are used to prove theoretical properties of a statistical test that allows for model selection between the Admixture Model and the Linkage Model. Finally, we demonstrate the practical relevance of our results by applying the test to real-world data from \cite{10002015global}.

We present an explicit formula for the $K$-theory of the $C^*$-algebra associated with a relative generalized Boolean dynamical system $(\CB, \CL, \theta, \CI_\af; \CJ)$. In particular, we find concrete generators for the $K_1$-group of $C^*(\CB, \CL, \theta, \CI_\af; \CJ)$. We also prove that every gauge-invariant ideal of $C^*(\CB, \CL, \theta, \CI_\af; \CJ)$ is Morita equivalent to a $C^*$-algebra of a relative generalized Boolean dynamical system.
As a structural application, we show that if the underlying Boolean dynamical system $(\CB, \CL, \theta)$ satisfies Condition (K), then the associated $C^*$-algebra is $K_0$-liftable. Furthermore, we deduce that if $C^*(\CB, \CL, \theta, \CI_\af; \CJ)$ is separable and purely infinite, then it has real rank zero.

In this paper, we establish existence and uniqueness of probabilistically strong solutions in $C(R_+, L^2[0,1])$. Our result resolves a problem from [Ann.

Due to nonlinearity, we work with first order moments, requiring precise estimates of the stochastic convolution.

Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO); Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM)
This paper presents a combinatorial study of the power contamination problem, a dynamic variant of power domination modeled on grid graphs. We resolve a conjecture posed by Ainouche and Bouroubi (2021) by proving it is false and instead establish the exact value of the power contamination number on grid graphs. Furthermore, we derive recurrence relations for this number and initiate the enumeration of optimal contamination sets. We prove that the number of optimal solutions for specific grid families corresponds to well-known integer sequences, including those counting ternary words with forbidden subwords and the large Schröder numbers. This work settles the fundamental combinatorial questions of the power contamination problem on grids and reveals its rich connections to classical combinatorics.

We study wave maps from the circle to a general compact Riemannian manifold.

As a remarkable intermediate result, we establish uniform-time global controllability between steady states, providing a partial answer to an open problem raised by Dehman, Lebeau and Zuazua (2003). Finally, we obtain quantitative exponential stability around closed geodesics with negative sectional curvature. This work highlights the rich interplay between partial differential equations, differential geometry, and control theory.

Subjects:
Functional Analysis (math.FA)
Let $X$ be a real or complex Banach space. Let $S(X)$ denote the unit sphere of $X$. For $x\in S(X)$, let $S_{x}=\{x^*\in S(X^*):x^*(x)=1\}$. A lot of Banach space geometry can be determined by the `quantum' of the state space $S_{x}$. In this paper, we mainly study the norm compactness and weak compactness of the state space in the space of Bochner integrable function and $c_{0}$-direct sums of Banach spaces. Suppose $X$ is such that $X^*$ is separable and let $\mu$ be the Lebesgue measure on $[0,1]$. For $f\in L^1(\mu,X)$, we demonstrate that if $S_{f}$ is norm compact, then $f$ is a smooth point. When $\mu$ is the discrete measure, we show that if $ (x_i) \in S(\ell^{1}(X))$ and $ \|x_{i}\|\neq 0$ for all $i\in{\mathbb{N}}$, then $ S_{(x_i)}$ is weakly compact in $ \ell^\infty(X^*) $ if and only if $ S_{\frac{x_i}{\|x_i\|}} $ is weakly compact in $X^*$ for each $i\in{\mathbb{N}}$ and $\text{diam}\left(S_{\frac{x_i}{\|x_i\|}}\right) \to 0 $. For discrete $c_{0}$-sums, we show that for $(x_{i})\in c_{0}(X)$, $S_{(x_{i})}$ is weakly compact if and only if for each $i_{0}\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\|x_{i_{0}}\|=1$, the state space $S_{x_{i_{0}}}$ is weakly compact.

We establish distortion estimates in completely solvable Lie groups, using a sublinear bilipschitz retraction constructed by Cornulier, and interpolating between two theorems of Osin. This provides new lower bounds on Dehn functions. Our second main result is the quasiisometric rigidity of $\rm{Sol}_5$ and its lattices. Together with a theorem of Peng, a key tool for the rigidity is the complete list of Dehn functions and dimensions of asymptotic cones of all simply connected solvable Lie groups of exponential growth up to dimension $5$, which we compute using Cornulier and Tessera's results.

On the $P(t)$-adic Littlewood Conjecture in Characteristics $\ell \equiv 3\pmod{4}$

Given a prime $p$, the $p$-adic Littlewood Conjecture stands as a well-known arithmetic variant of the celebrated Littlewood Conjecture in Diophantine Approximation. In the same way as the latter, it admits a natural function field analogue depending on the choice of an irreducible polynomial $P(t)$ with coefficients in a field $\mathbb{K}$. This analogue is referred to as the $P(t)$-adic Littlewood Conjecture ($P(t)$-LC for short).
$P(t)$-LC is proved to fail for any choice of irreducible polynomial $P(t)$ over any ground field $\mathbb{K}$ with characteristic $ \ell \equiv 3\pmod{4}$. The counterexample refuting it is shown to present a local arithmetic obstruction emerging from the fact that -1 is not a quadratic residue modulo a prime $\ell\equiv 3\pmod{4}$.
The theory developed elucidates and generalises all previous approaches towards refuting the conjecture. They were all based on the computer-assisted method initiated by Adiceam, Nesharim and Lunnon (2021) which has been able to establish that $P(t)$-LC fails in some small characteristics (essentially up to 11). This computer-assisted method is, however, unable to provide a general statement as it relies on ad hoc computer verifications which, provided they terminate, refute $P(t)$--LC in a given characteristic. This limitation is overcome by exhibiting an arithmetic obstruction to the validity of $P(t)$--LC in infinitely many this http URL leaves the remaining case of odd characteristics $\ell\equiv 1\pmod{4}$ dependent on their full determination.

Additional Constructions of Sequences of Alternating Sum and Difference Dominated Sets

Subjects:
Number Theory (math.NT)
A More Sums Than Differences (MSTD) set is a finite set of integers $A$ where the cardinality of its sumset, $A+A$, is greater than the cardinality of its difference set, $A-A$. We address a problem posed by Samuel Allen Alexander that asks whether there exists an infinite sequence of sets alternating between being MSTD and More Differences Than Sums (MDTS), where each set properly contains the previous. While a companion paper resolved this using `filling in' techniques, we solve the more challenging `non-filling-in' version, where any missing integer between a set's minimum and maximum elements remains missing in all subsequent sets.

Degenerate Elliptic PDEs on a Network with Kirchhoff Conditions
Guy Barles (IDP), Olivier Ley (IRMAR), Erwin Topp (IM / UFRJ)
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
In this article, we are interested in semilinear, possibly degenerate elliptic equations posed on a general network, with nonlinear Kirchhoff-type conditions for its interior vertices and Dirichlet boundary conditions for the boundary ones. The novelty here is the generality of the equations posed on each edge that is incident to a particular vertex, ranging from first-order equations to uniformly elliptic ones. Our main result is a strong comparison principle, i.e., a comparison result between discontinuous viscosity sub and supersolutions of such problems, from which we conclude the existence and uniqueness of a continuous viscosity by Perron's method. Further extensions are also discussed.

Title:
Theoretical Analysis on the Ability of Particle Swarm Optimization to Escape from Local Optimum
Haoxin Wang, Libao Shi
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
As one of the most prominent swarm intelligence algorithms, particle swarm optimization (PSO) has been extensively applied to solve global optimization problems. The theoretical analysis on the ability of PSO to escape from local optimum (LO) is deeply intertwined with its global optimization performance, making it highly significant to investigate the underlying mechanisms that enable PSO to escape from LO and achieve global optimization. In this study, a rigorous mathematical analysis is presented to explore the ability and mechanisms of PSO to escape from LO. By modelling each search agent as a Markov chain, the probability of PSO escaping from LO within a finite number of iterations is calculated, and the behavior of agents prior to escaping from LO is analyzed. Through this theoretical analysis, two necessary and sufficient conditions are proposed to ensure that PSO escapes from LO in finite iterations with a probability 1: (a) the personal best (pbest) and global best (gbest) positions stagnate around different local optima, and (b) the inertial weight in PSO is equal to one. Upon these conditions, two potential behaviors of agents, namely inertial motion and oscillation, are proposed, and a state transition chain of the agent toward the global optimum is constructed. Additionally, the theoretical analysis reveals that increasing the distance between pbest and gbest, as well as the values of the learning factors in PSO, enhances the speed at which PSO escapes from LO. Finally, the conclusions drawn from the theoretical analysis are corroborated through numerical experiments.

Timelike conjugate points in Lorentzian length spaces

Subjects:
Differential Geometry (math.DG); Metric Geometry (math.MG)
We study notions of conjugate points along timelike geodesics in the synthetic setting of Lorentzian (pre-)length spaces, inspired by earlier work for metric spaces by Shankar--Sormani. After preliminary considerations on convergence of timelike and causal geodesics, we introduce and compare one-sided, symmetric, unreachable and ultimate conjugate points along timelike geodesics. We show that all such notions are compatible with the usual one in the smooth (strongly causal) spacetime setting. As applications, we prove a timelike Rauch comparison theorem, as well as a result closely related to the recently established Lorentzian Cartan--Hadamard theorem by Erös--Gieger. In the appendix, we give a detailed treatment of the Fréchet distance on the space of non-stopping curves up to reparametrization, a technical tool used throughout the paper.

Spectral selectors on strongly orderable contact manifolds and applications

Subjects:

We prove that the spectral selectors introduced by the author for closed strongly orderable contact manifolds satisfy algebraic properties analogous to those of the spectral selectors for lens spaces constructed by Allais, Sandon and the author using Givental's nonlinear Maslov index. As applications, first we establish a contact big fiber theorem for closed strongly orderable contact manifolds as well as for lens spaces. Second, when the Reeb flow is periodic, we construct a stably unbounded conjugation invariant norm on the contactomorphism group universal cover. Moreover, when all its orbits have the same period, we show that the Reeb flow is a geodesic for the discriminant and oscillation norms of Colin-Sandon.

For $p>0$ a small parameter, let $\mathcal A \subseteq \mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ be a random subset where each positive integer is included independently with probability $p$. We show that, with high probability (as $p \to 0$), the numerical semigroup $\langle\mathcal A\rangle:=\{a_1+\cdots+a_k: k \geq 0, a_1, \ldots, a_k \in \mathcal A\}$ generated by $\mathcal A$ has Frobenius number and genus of size $\asymp p^{-1}(\log p^{-1})^2$ and embedding dimension of size $\asymp (\log p^{-1})^2$. This resolves an open problem of Bogart and the second author.

Higher Abelian Quantum Double Models

Subjects:
Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
This paper focuses on the generalized version of the quantum double model on arbitrary $N$-dimensional simplicial complexes with finite local regularity. The core of our analysis is a detailed characterization of the frustration-free ground state space $\mathrm{FG}_{\mathrm{QDM}}(\mathfrak{A})$. A central result is the construction of the algebra of logical operators $\mathfrak{A}_{\mathrm{log}} := \mathfrak{K}'/\mathfrak{J}$, where the redundancy ideal $\mathfrak{J}$ quotients out operators that act trivially on the ground state space. We prove a homeomorphism between the state space of $\mathfrak{A}_{\mathrm{log}}$ and $\mathrm{FG}_{\mathrm{QDM}}(\mathfrak{A})$, effectively classifying all frustration-free ground states. This logical algebra is shown to exhibit generalized Canonical Commutation Relations (CCR). When the relevant (co)homology groups are finite, $\mathfrak{A}_{\mathrm{log}}$ is isomorphic to $C(X_c) \otimes \mathcal{B}(\mathfrak{h}_q)$, revealing that the ground state space can encode $c$ classical bits and $q$ quantum bits (qubits), providing a precise measure of its information storage capacity.

Random attractor and SRB measure for stochastic Hopf bifurcation under discretization
Chuchu Chen, Jialin Hong, Yibo Wang
Subjects:
Dynamical Systems (math.DS)
Chaotic phases in stochastic differential equations are characterized by two essential long-time dynamical features: a random attractor capturing asymptotic geometry and a Sinai-Ruelle-Bowen (SRB) measure describing statistical information. This paper investigates whether the stochastic Hopf bifurcation under discretization could inherit both features. We establish that the stochastic Hopf bifurcation under discretization induces a discrete random dynamical system. Further, we prove that this discrete system possesses a random attractor, and then derive the existence of an SRB measure by demonstrating a strictly positive numerical Lyapunov exponent. Numerical experiments visualize the retained random attractor and SRB measure for the discrete random dynamical system, revealing structures consistent with the theoretical chaotic phase.

Trust Region Algorithm for Stochastic Minimax Problems with Decision-Dependent Distributions

Comments:

Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
Stochastic minimax optimization has drawn much attention over the past decade due to its broad applications in machine learning, signal processing and game theory. In some applications, the probability distribution of uncertainty depends on decision variables, as the environment may respond to decisions. In this paper, we propose a trust region algorithm for finding the stationary points of stochastic minimax problems with decision-dependent distributions. At each iteration, the algorithm locally learns the dependence of the random variable on the decision variable from data samples via linear regression, and updates the decision variable by solving trust-region subproblem with the learned distribution. When the objective function is nonconvex--strongly concave and the distribution map follows a regression model, we prove the almost sure convergence of the iterates to a stationary point of the primal function. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is further demonstrated through numerical experiments on both synthetic and real-world data sets.

Gaussian Mixture Model with unknown diagonal covariances via continuous sparse regularization

Subjects:
Statistics Theory (math.ST); Machine Learning (stat.ML)
This paper addresses the statistical estimation of Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) with unknown diagonal covariances from independent and identically distributed samples. We employ the Beurling-LASSO (BLASSO), a convex optimization framework that promotes sparsity in the space of measures, to simultaneously estimate the number of components and their parameters. Our main contribution extends the BLASSO methodology to multivariate GMMs with component-specific unknown diagonal covariance matrices-a significantly more flexible setting than previous approaches requiring known and identical covariances. We establish non-asymptotic recovery guarantees with nearly parametric convergence rates for component means, diagonal covariances, and weights, as well as for density prediction. A key theoretical contribution is the identification of an explicit separation condition on mixture components that enables the construction of non-degenerate dual certificates-essential tools for establishing statistical guarantees for the BLASSO. Our analysis leverages the Fisher-Rao geometry of the statistical model and introduces a novel semi-distance adapted to our framework, providing new insights into the interplay between component separation, parameter space geometry, and achievable statistical recovery.

Neural Network Localized Orthogonal Decomposition for Numerical Homogenization of Diffusion Operators with Random Coefficients
Fabian Kröpfl, Daniel Peterseim, Elisabeth Ullmann
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
This paper presents a neural network--enhanced surrogate modeling approach for diffusion problems with spatially varying random field coefficients. The method builds on numerical homogenization, which compresses fine-scale coefficients into coarse-scale surrogates without requiring periodicity. To overcome computational bottlenecks, we train a neural network to map fine-scale coefficient samples to effective coarse-scale information, enabling the construction of accurate surrogates at the target resolution. This framework allows for the fast and efficient compression of new coefficient realizations, thereby ensuring reliable coarse models and supporting scalable computations for large ensembles of random coefficients. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through systematic numerical experiments for two classes of coefficients, emphasizing the influence of coefficient contrast: (i) lognormal diffusion coefficients, a standard model for uncertain subsurface structures in geophysics, and (ii) hierarchical Gaussian random fields with random correlation lengths.

A relative trace formula and counting geodesic arcs in the hyperbolic plane

Comments:

Subjects:
Number Theory (math.NT)
We study a modification of the hyperbolic circle problem: instead of all elements of a Fuchsian group $\Gamma$, we consider the double cosets by two hyperbolic subgroups. This has a geometric interpretation in terms of the number of common perpendiculars between two closed geodesics for $\Gamma \backslash\mathbb{H}$. We prove an explicit relative trace formula, which is flexible for the counting problem. Using a large sieve inequality developed by the first author and Voskou, we prove a new bound in mean square for the error term of order $O(X^{1/2}\log X)$. We conjecture that this is the correct order of growth. Along the way we provide a new proof of the pointwise error bound $O(X^{2/3})$, originally proved by Good.

Higher Lie characters form a distinguished family of symmetric group characters, which appear in many areas of algebra and combinatorics. An old open problem of Thrall is to decompose them into irreducibles. We propose a novel asymptotic approach to this problem, showing that many families of higher Lie characters tend to be proportional to the regular character. In particular, a random higher Lie character tends, in probability, to be proportional to the regular character.

Consensus-Based Optimization Beyond Finite-Time Analysis

Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
We analyze a zeroth-order particle algorithm for the global optimization of a non-convex function, focusing on a variant of Consensus-Based Optimization (CBO) with small but fixed noise intensity. Unlike most previous studies restricted to finite horizons, we investigate its long-time behavior with fixed parameters. In the mean-field limit, a quantitative Laplace principle shows exponential convergence to a neighborhood of the minimizer x * . For finitely many particles, a block-wise analysis yields explicit error bounds: individual particles achieve long-time consistency near x * , and the global best particle converge to x * . The proof technique combines a quantitative Laplace principle with block-wise control of Wasserstein distances, avoiding the exponential blow-up typical of Gr{ö}nwall-based estimates.

Nichols algebras, tensor categories and Kazhdan-Lusztig correspondences

Quantum Algebra (math.QA); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
There is a very general picture emerging that conjecturally describes what happens to the representation theory of a vertex algebra $\mathcal{V}$ if we pass to the kernel $\mathcal{W}$ of a set of screening operators. Namely, the screening operators generate a Nichols algebra $H$ inside $\mathrm{Rep}(\mathcal{V})$ and in many cases $\mathrm{Rep}(\mathcal{W})$ coincides with the relative Drinfeld center of $\mathrm{Rep}(H)$. This vastly generalizes the construction of a quantum group as the Drinfeld double of a Nichols algebra over the Cartan part. In this example, the conjectural category equivalence has been studied since around $20$ years as logarithmic Kazhdan Lusztig correspondence.
The present survey was part of my habilitation thesis about my work in this area. I want to make it available as an introductory text, intended for readers from a pure algebra background as well as from a physics background. I motivate and explain gently and informally the different topics involved (quantum groups, Nichols algebras, vertex algebras, braided tensor categories) with a distinct categorical point of view, to the point that I can explain my general expectation. Then I explain some previous results and explain the main techniques in my recent proof of the conjectured category equivalence in case $\mathcal{V}$ is a free field theory and under technical assumptions on the analysis side.

A geometric model of synthetic filtrations via context-dependent time
Takanori Adachi
Comments:
18 pages
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
Classical filtrations in probability theory formalize the accumulation of information along a linear time axis: the past is unique and the present evolves into an uncertain future. In many contexts, however, information is neither linear nor uniquely determined by a single history. In this paper we propose a geometric model of synthetic filtrations, where the present may be formed by synthesizing multiple possible pasts. To achieve this, we introduce a new category {\Sigma}, an extension of the simplex category {\Delta}, whose objects encode context-dependent times. Synthetic filtrations are realized as contravariant functors {\Sigma} {\to} Prob, where Prob is the category of probability spaces with null-preserving maps. After seeing a general definition of synthetic filtrations, we define, as a concrete example, Dirichlet filtrations, where probability measures on simplices arise from Dirichlet distributions, highlighting the role of parameter and contextual uncertainty. Finally, we interpret Bayesian updating as a categorical update of a Dirichlet functor, showing how learning fits naturally into the synthetic filtration framework. This work combines categorical probability, simplicial geometry, and Bayesian statistics, and suggests new applications in finance, stochastic modeling, and subjective probability.

We prove consistency and derive an upper bound for the error in the $L^p$ norm, in terms of discretization and smoothening parameters $h$ and $\varepsilon$. We illustrate the applicability of the approach and the role of the parameters with several interesting numerical examples.

This paper establishes existence, uniqueness, and an L^1-comparison principle for weak solutions of a PDE system modeling phase transition reaction-diffusion in congested crowd motion. We consider a general reaction term and mixed homogeneous (Dirichlet and Neumann) boundary conditions. This model is applicable to various problems, including multi-species diffusion-segregation and pedestrian dynamics with congestion. Furthermore, our analysis of the reaction term yields sufficient conditions combining the drift with the reaction that guarantee the absence of congestion, reducing the dynamics to a constrained linear reaction-transport equation.

Numerous studies have reported two types of doubling of invariant closed curves (ICCs) in dynamical systems: (a) the creation of two disjoint ICCs such that iterations flip between them; and (b) the creation of a single ICC of double the length of the original ICC. Various methods have been proposed to analyze such bifurcations. We show that the methods proposed so far are not always adequate for analyzing and predicting these bifurcations. We propose a new method to overcome the difficulties.

Perturbation theory of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations and its application
Kazuyuki Tsuda
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
In this article, a perturbation theory of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\mathbb{R}^n$ $(n \geq 3)$ is studied to investigate decay estimate of solutions around a non-constant state. As a concrete problem, stability is considered for a perturbation system from a stationary solution $u_\omega$ belonging to the weak $L^n$ space. Decay rates of the perturbation including $L^\infty$ norm are obtained which coincide with those of the heat kernel. The proof is based on deriving suitable resolvent estimates with perturbation terms in the low frequency part having a parabolic spectral curve. Our method can be applicable to dispersive hyperbolic systems like wave equations with strong damping. Indeed, a parabolic type decay rate of a solution is obtained for a damped wave equation including variable coefficients which satisfy spatial decay conditions.

Optimal Rates for Ergodic SDEs Driven by Multiplicative $α$-Stable Processes in Wasserstein-1 distance

Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
This paper establishes the quantitative stability of invariant measures $\mu_{\alpha}$ for $\mathbb{R}^d$-valued ergodic stochastic differential equations driven by rotationally invariant multiplicative $\alpha$-stable processes with $\alpha\in(1,2]$. Under structural assumptions on the coefficients with a fixed parameter vector $\bm{\theta}$, we derive optimal convergence rates in the Wasserstein-$1$ ($\cW_{1}$) distance between the invariant measures introduced above, namely,
\item[(i)] For any interval $[\alpha_0, \vartheta_0] \subset (1,2)$, there exists $C_1 = C(\alpha_0, \vartheta_0,\bm{\theta},d) > 0$ such that
\cW_{1}(\mu_\alpha, \mu_\vartheta) \leq C_1 |\alpha - \vartheta|, \quad \forall \alpha, \vartheta \in [\alpha_0, \vartheta_0].
\item[(ii)] For any $\alpha_0\in (1,2)$, there exists $C_2 = C(\alpha_0, \bm{\theta}) > 0$ such that \begin{align*}
\cW_{1}(\mu_\alpha, \mu_2) \leq C_2\, d(2 - \alpha), \quad \forall \alpha \in [\alpha_0, 2).
The optimality of these rates is rigorously verified by explicit calculations for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck systems in \cite{Deng2023Optimal}. It is worth emphasizing that \cite{Deng2023Optimal} addressed only case (ii) under additive noise, whereas our analysis establishes results for both cases (i) and (ii) under multiplicative $\alpha$-stable noise, employing fundamentally different analytical methods.

It is well known that, given \(b\ge 0\), finding an $(a,b)$-trapping set with the minimum \(a\) in a binary linear code is NP-hard. In this paper, we demonstrate that this problem can be solved with linear complexity with respect to the code length for codes with bounded treewidth. Furthermore, suppose a tree decomposition corresponding to the treewidth of the binary linear code is known. In that case, we also provide a specific algorithm to compute the minimum \(a\) and the number of the corresponding \((a, b)\)-trapping sets for a given \(b\) with linear complexity. Simulation experiments are presented to verify the correctness of the proposed algorithm.

Strassen's theorem for biased convex order

Probability (math.PR); Mathematical Finance (q-fin.MF)
Strassen's theorem asserts that for given marginal probabilities $\mu,\nu$ there exists a martingale starting in $\mu$ and terminating in $\nu$ if and only if $\mu,\nu$ are in convex order. From a financial perspective, it guarantees the existence of market-consistent martingale pricing measures for arbitrage-free prices of European call options and thus plays a fundamental role in robust finance. Arbitrage-free prices of American options demand a stronger version of martingales which are 'biased' in a specific sense. In this paper, we derive an extension of Strassen's theorem that links them to an appropriate strengthening of the convex order. Moreover, we provide a characterization of this order through integrals with respect to compensated Poisson processes.

Finite element method for a constant time delay subdiffusion equation with Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative
Weiping Bu, Chen Nie, Weizhi Liao
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
This work considers to numerically solve a subdiffusion equation involving constant time delay $\tau$ and Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative. First, a fully discrete finite element scheme is developed for the considered problem under the symmetric graded time mesh, where the Caputo fractional derivative is approximated via the L1 formula, while the Riemann-Liouville integral is discretized using the fractional right rectangular rule. Under the assumption that the exact solution has low regularities at $t=0$ and $\tau$, the local truncation errors of both the L1 formula and the fractional right rectangular rule are analyzed. It is worth noting that, by setting the mesh parameter $r=1$, the symmetric graded time mesh will degenerate to a uniform mesh. Consequently, we proceed to discuss the stability and convergence of the proposed numerical scheme under two scenarios. For the uniform time mesh, by introducing a discrete sequence $\{P_k\}$, the unconditional stability and local time error estimate for the developed scheme is established. Conversely, on the symmetric graded time mesh, through the introduction of a discrete fractional Gronwall inequality, the stability and globally optimal time error estimate can be obtained. Finally, some numerical tests are presented to validate the theoretical results.

Finite coproducts, coregularity and coexactness for profinite interior algebras

Subjects:
Logic (math.LO); Category Theory (math.CT)
In previous articles, we showed that the category of profinite $L$-algebras (where $L$ is a normal modal logic with the finite model property) is monadic over $\textbf{Set}$. Then, we developed sequent calculi for extensions of the language of $L$ with infinitary conjunctions and disjunctions, proving completeness with respect to profinite $L$-algebras and relating syntactic properties of the calculi with regularity/exactness properties of the category opposite to profinite $L$-algebras. In this paper, we focus on the algebraic perspective: we characterize those $L$ extending $S4$ whose profinite algebras enjoy such categorical properties.

Definability of some $k$-ary Relations Over Second Order kinds of Logics
Simone Costa, Marco Dalai, Stefano Della Fiore, Anita Pasotti
Subjects:
Logic (math.LO)
We consider the exprissibility in monadic second order logic of certain relations of importance in computer science. For integers $n\geq 1$ and $k\leq b$, a $k$-tuple of sequences in $\{0,1,\ldots, b-1\}^n$ are said to be $k$-hashed if there is a coordinate where they all differ. A set $\mathcal{C}$ of sequences is said to be a $k$-hash code if any $k$ distinct elements are $k$-hashed. Testing whether a code is $k$-hashing and determining the largest size of $k$-hash codes is an important problem in computer science. The use of general purpose solvers for this problem leads to question what minimal logic is needed to represent the problem.
In this paper, we prove that the $k$-hashing relation on $k$-tuples is not definable in Monadic Second Order Logic (MSO), highlighting its limitations for this problem. Instead, the property can be expressed in extensions of the MSO that add the equi-cardinality relation.

A Dantzig-Wolfe Reformulation for Automated Aircraft Arrival Routing and Scheduling
Roghayeh Hajizadeh, Tatiana Polishchuk, Elina Rönnberg, Christiane Schmidt
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
We consider the problem of computing aircraft arrival routes in a terminal maneuvering area (TMA) together with an automated scheduling of all the arrivals within a given time interval. The arrival routes are modeled as energy-efficient continuous-descent operations, such that separation based on wake-turbulence categories is guaranteed within the TMA. We propose a new model based on a Dantzig-Wolfe reformulation of a previous model for this problem. As in the previous model, we include tree consistency across consecutive planning intervals. However, the reformulation enables us to further improve the model and also consider aircraft that remain in the TMA from the previous period, a feature critical for operational safety. In computational experiments for Stockholm Arlanda airport, the new model consistently outperforms the previous one: we obtain solutions within 5 seconds to 12.65 minutes compared to 40.9 hours with the old model for instances of half hours with high traffic. In addition, we are able to solve instances of a full hour of arriving aircraft with high traffic (33 aircraft) within 22.22 to 58.57 minutes, whereas the old model could not solve these instances at all. While we schedule all aircraft as continuous-descent arrivals, our model can be applied to any type of speed profiles for the arriving aircraft.

In this paper, we introduce the notions of dualizing complexes and balanced dualizing complexes over $\mathbb{Z}$-algebras. We prove that a noetherian connected $\mathbb{Z}$-algebra $A$ admits a balanced dualizing complex if and only if $A$ satisfies Artin-Zhang's $\chi$-condition, has finite local cohomology dimension, and possesses symmetric derived torsion as a bigraded $A$-$A$-bimodule. As an application of our study of dualizing complexes, we show that any smooth noncommutative projective scheme associated to a $\mathbb{Z}$-algebra with a balanced dualizing complex admits a Serre functor.

Birkhoff attractors for dissipative symplectic billiards
Luca Baracco, Olga Bernardi, Anna Florio, Alessandra Nardi
Subjects:
Dynamical Systems (math.DS)
The aim of the present paper is to propose and study a dissipative variant of symplectic billiards within planar strictly convex domains. The associated billiard map is dissipative, thus it admits a compact invariant set, the so-called Birkhoff attractor. Its complexity depends on the rate of the dissipation as well as on the geometry of the billiard table. We prove that (a) for strong dissipation, the Birkhoff attractor is a normally contracted graph over the zero section; (b) for mild dissipation, the Birkhoff attractor within a centrally symmetric domain is an indecomposable continuum whose restricted dynamics has positive topological entropy. We compare these results with the case of dissipative Birkhoff billiards, studied in a paper by Bernardi-Florio-Leguil

The Derived $l$-Modular Unipotent Block of $p$-adic $\mathrm{GL}_n$

Subjects:
Representation Theory (math.RT); Number Theory (math.NT)
For a non-Archimedean local field $F$ of residue cardinality $q=p^r$, we give an explicit classical generator $V$ for the bounded derived category $D_{fg}^b(\mathsf{H}_1(G))$ of finitely generated unipotent representations of $G=\mathrm{GL}_n(F)$ over an algebraically closed field of characteristic $l\neq p$. The generator $V$ has an explicit description that is much simpler than any known progenerator in the underived setting. This generalises a previous result of the author in the case where $n=2$ and $l$ is odd dividing $q+1$, and provides a triangulated equivalence between $D_{fg}^b(\mathsf{H}_1(G))$ and the category of perfect complexes over the dg algebra of dg endomorphisms of a projective resolution of $V$. This dg algebra can be thought of as a dg-enhanced Schur algebra. As an intermediate step, we also prove the analogous result for the case where $F$ is a finite field.

An involution for trivariate symmetries of vincular patterns

Comments:

Subjects:

We provide a bijective proof of the equidistribution of two pairs of vincular patterns in permutations, thereby resolving a recent open problem of Bitonti, Deb, and Sokal (arXiv:2412.10214). Since the bijection is involutive, we also confirm their conjecture on the equidistribution of triple vincular patterns. Somewhat unexpectedly, we show that this involution is closed on the set of Baxter permutations, thereby implying another trivariate symmetries of vincular patterns. The proof of this second result requires a variant of a characterization of Baxter permutations in terms of restricted Laguerre histories, first given by Viennot using the Françon-Viennot bijection.

Event-triggered robust control of linear systems: Sliding mode cone method
Bangxin Jiang, Ying Liu, Yang Liu, Jianquan Lu, Weihua Gui
Comments:
24 pages
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
In this paper, we investigate the global robust stabilization of linear time-invariant systems by using event-triggered sliding mode control (SMC). Different from the practical sliding mode band, which is commonly used in previous studies on event-triggered SMC, a new concept of ideal sliding mode cone is proposed in this paper. Specifically, we design a hybrid event-triggering mechanism that takes into account both the size and direction shift of the error state. The proposed event-triggered SMC law is shown to enforce and sustain the system state in the ideal sliding mode cone. Moreover, the state of the closed-loop system can asymptotically converge to the equilibrium point, rather than merely to a neighborhood of it, which is usually difficult to handle by using practical sliding mode band. Technically speaking, to achieve strong convergence, the triggering frequency should naturally be as high as possible due to the existence of the external disturbances, but this will also increase the communication load. Hence, to balance the asymptotic convergence and frequent triggering near the equilibrium point that is the price paid for achieving asymptotic stability, we extend the obtained results to the case of practical sliding mode cone. In addition, it is verified that the ETM is global, namely, the inter-event times are uniformly lower bounded from zero globally. Further, a practical application for the quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles is presented. Finally, three illustrative examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the obtained results.

Variational data assimilation for the wave equation in heterogeneous media: Numerical investigation of stability

In recent years, several numerical methods for solving the unique continuation problem for the wave equation in a homogeneous medium with given data on the lateral boundary of the space-time cylinder have been proposed. This problem enjoys Lipschitz stability if the geometric control condition is fulfilled, which allows devising optimally convergent numerical methods. In this article, we investigate whether these results carry over to the case in which the medium exhibits a jump discontinuity. Our numerical experiments suggest a positive answer. However, we also observe that the presence of discontinuities in the medium renders the computations far more demanding than in the homogeneous case.

New Helly-type results for discrete boxes: Quantitative colorful and $(p,q)$-variants

Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
In 2008, Halman showed that for any finite set $P\subset \mathbb R^d$ and any finite family $\mathcal{B}$ of axis-parallel boxes in $\mathbb{R}^d$, if the intersection of $P$ and any subfamily $\mathcal{B}' \subseteq\mathcal{B}$ of size at most $2d$ is non-empty, then the intersection of $P$ and $\mathcal{B}$ is also non-empty. Very recently Edwards and Soberón initiated the study of quantitative colorful version for $2d$ families, $(p,q)$-type variation for $p\geq q\geq d+1$, and other extensions of this Helly-type result by Halman.
In this paper, we study the quantitative colorful Halman problem for $2d-1$ families as well its $(p,q)$-type variation for $p\geq q\geq 2$. Specifically, our main result asserts that for any finite set $P$ and finite families of boxes $\mathcal{B}_1,\dots,\mathcal{B}_{2d-1}$ in $\mathbb R^d$, where $d\geq 2$, if every transversal $\mathcal{B}$ for the families has an intersection $\bigcap \mathcal{B}$ containing at least $n$ points of $P$, then there exist $j\in[2d-1]$ and a subset of $P$ of size at most \[ 2n+\Big\lfloor \frac{n-1}{d \cdot 2^{d-1}} \Big\rfloor, \] such that each box of $\mathcal{B}_j$ contains at least $n$ points of this subset.

Elementary differentials from multi-indices to rooted trees

Rooted trees are essential for describing numerical schemes via the so-called B-series. They have also been used extensively in rough analysis for expanding solutions of singular Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDEs). When one considers scalar-valued equations, the most efficient combinatorial set is multi-indices. In this paper, we investigate the existence of intermediate combinatorial sets that will lie between multi-indices and rooted trees. We provide a negative result stating that there is no combinatorial set encoding elementary differentials in dimension $d\neq 1$, and compatible with the rooted trees and the multi-indices aside from the rooted trees. This does not close the debate of the existence of such combinatorial sets, but it shows that it cannot be obtained via a naive and natural approach.

On the Fixed Point Property in Reflexive Banach Spaces

Comments:
35 pages, 1 fig., asm
Subjects:
Functional Analysis (math.FA); Programming Languages (cs.PL)
Fixed point theory studies conditions under which nonexpansive maps on Banach spaces have fixed points. This paper examines the open question of whether every reflexive Banach space has the fixed point property. After surveying classical results, we propose a quantitative framework based on diametral l1 pressure and weighted selection functionals, which measure how much an orbit hull of a fixed point free nonexpansive map can collapse. We prove that if either invariant is uniformly positive, then the space must contain a copy of l1 and thus cannot be reflexive. We present finite dimensional certificates, positive and negative examples, and an x86-64 routine that computes mutual coherence and a lower bound for the pressure. The paper clarifies why existing approaches fail and outlines open problems and ethical considerations.

Parities in random Latin squares
Matthew Kwan, Kalina Petrova, Mehtaab Sawhney
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR); Combinatorics (math.CO)
In a Latin square, every row can be interpreted as a permutation, and therefore has a parity (even or odd). We prove that in a uniformly random $n\times n$ Latin square, the $n$ row parities are very well approximated by a sequence of $n$ independent unbiased coin flips: for example, the total variation error of this approximation tends to zero as $n\to\infty$. This resolves a conjecture of Cameron. In fact, we prove a generalisation of Cameron's conjecture for the joint distribution of the row parities, column parities and symbol parities (the latter are defined by the symmetry between rows, columns and symbols of a Latin square).
Along the way, we introduce several general techniques for the study of random Latin squares, including a new re-randomisation technique via `stable intercalate switchings', and a new approximation theorem comparing random Latin squares with a certain independent model.

Optimal Conformal Prediction, E-values, Fuzzy Prediction Sets and Subsequent Decisions
Nick W. Koning, Sam van Meer
Subjects:
Statistics Theory (math.ST); Methodology (stat.ME); Machine Learning (stat.ML)
We make three contributions to conformal prediction. First, we propose fuzzy conformal confidence sets that offer a degree of exclusion, generalizing beyond the binary inclusion/exclusion offered by classical confidence sets. We connect fuzzy confidence sets to e-values to show this degree of exclusion is equivalent to an exclusion at different confidence levels, capturing precisely what e-values bring to conformal prediction. We show that a fuzzy confidence set is a predictive distribution with a more appropriate error guarantee. Second, we derive optimal conformal confidence sets by interpreting the minimization of the expected measure of the confidence set as an optimal testing problem against a particular alternative. We use this to characterize exactly in what sense traditional conformal prediction is optimal. Third, we generalize the inheritance of guarantees by subsequent minimax decisions from confidence sets to fuzzy confidence sets. All our results generalize beyond the exchangeable conformal setting to prediction sets for arbitrary models. In particular, we find that any valid test (e-value) for a hypothesis automatically defines a (fuzzy) prediction confidence set.

On Shrinking Ricci solitons with positive isotropic curvature in higher dimensions

Subjects:

For all dimensions $n\geq5$, let $(M,g,f)$ be a $n-$dimensional shrinking gradient Ricci soliton with strictly positive isotropic curvature (PIC). Suppose furthermore that $\nabla^2f$ is $2-$nonnegative and the curvature tensor is WPIC1 at some point $\bar{x}\in M$. Then $(M,g)$ must be a quotient of either $S^{n}$ or $S^{n-1}\times\mathbb{R}$. Our result partially extends the classification result for 4-dimensional PIC shrinking Ricci solitons established in [LNW16] to highter dimensions. Combining the pinching estimates deduced in [Chen24] we also extend the result in [CL23] to dimensions $n\geq9$. Namely that a complete ancient solution to the Ricci flow of dimension $n\geq9$ with uniformly PIC must be weakly PIC2.

We establish global existence and decay of solutions of a viscous half Klein-Gordon equation with a quadratic nonlinearity considering initial data, whose Fourier transform is small in L1 cap Linfty. Our analysis relies on the observation that nonresonant dispersive effects yield a transformation of the quadratic nonlinearity into a subcritical nonlocal quartic one, which can be controlled by the linear diffusive dynamics through a standard L1 - Linfty argument. This transformation can be realized by applying the normal form method of Shatah or, equivalently, through integration by parts in time in the associated Duhamel formula.

Cardinality-Constrained Bilevel Capacity Expansion
Lei Guo, Jiayang Li
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
As a fundamental problem in transportation and operations research, the bilevel capacity expansion problem (BCEP) has been extensively studied for decades. In practice, BCEPs are commonly addressed in two stages: first, pre-select a small set of links for expansion; then, optimize their capacities. However, this sequential and separable approach can lead to suboptimal solutions as it neglects the critical interdependence between link selection and capacity allocation. In this paper, we propose to introduce a cardinality constraint into the BCEP to limit the number of expansion locations rather than fixing such locations beforehand. This allows us to search over all possible link combinations within the prescribed limit, thereby enabling the joint optimization of both expansion locations and capacity levels. The resulting cardinality-constrained BCEP (CCBCEP) is computationally challenging due to the combination of a nonconvex equilibrium constraint and a nonconvex and discontinuous cardinality constraint. To address this challenge, we develop a penalized difference-of-convex (DC) approach that transforms the original problem into a sequence of tractable subproblems by exploiting its inherent DC structure and the special properties of the cardinality constraint. We prove that the method converges to approximate Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) solutions with arbitrarily prescribed accuracy. Numerical experiments further show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms alternative methods for identifying practically feasible expansion plans investing only a few links, both in solution quality and computational efficiency.

Fix a smooth Morse function $U\colon \mathbb{R}^{d}\to\mathbb{R}$ with finitely many critical points, and consider the solution of the stochastic differential equation \begin{equation*} d\bm{x}_{\epsilon}(t)=-\nabla U(\bm{x}_{\epsilon}(t))\,dt \,+\,\sqrt{2\epsilon}\, d\bm{w}_{t}\,, \end{equation*} where $(\bm{w}_{t})_{t\ge0}$ represents a $d$-dimensional Brownian motion, and $\epsilon>0$ a small parameter. Denote by $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^{d})$ the space of probability measures on $\bb R^d$, and by $\mathcal{I}_{\epsilon} \colon \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^{d})\to[0,\,\infty]$ the Donsker--Varadhan level two large deviations rate functional. We express $\mc I_\epsilon$ as $\mc I_\epsilon = \epsilon^{-1} \mc J^{(-1)} + \mc J^{(0)} + \sum_{1\le p\le \mf q} (1/\theta^{(p)}_\epsilon) \, \mc J^{(p)}$, where $\mc J^{(p)}\colon \mc P(\bb R^d) \to [0,+\infty]$ stand for rate functionals independent of $\epsilon$ and $\theta^{(p)}_\epsilon$ for sequences such that $\theta^{(1)}_\epsilon \to\infty$, $\theta^{(p)}_\epsilon / \theta^{(p+1)}_\epsilon \to 0$ for $1\le p< \mf q$. The speeds $\theta^{(p)}_\epsilon$ correspond to the time-scales at which the diffusion $\bm{x}_{\epsilon}(\cdot)$ exhibits a metastable behaviour, while the functional $\mc J^{(p)}$ represent the level two, large deviations rate functionals of the finite-state, continuous-time Markov chains which describe the evolution of the diffusion $\bm{x}_{\epsilon}(\cdot)$ among the wells in the time-scale $\theta^{(p)}_\epsilon$.

We develop numerical schemes and sensitivity methods for stochastic models of proton transport that couple energy loss, range straggling and angular diffusion. For the energy equation we introduce a logarithmic Milstein scheme that guarantees positivity and achieves strong order one convergence. For the angular dynamics we construct a Lie-group integrator. The combined method maintains the natural geometric invariants of the system.
We formulate dose deposition as a regularised path-dependent functional, obtaining a pathwise sensitivity estimator that is consistent and implementable. Numerical experiments confirm that the proposed schemes achieve the expected convergence rates and provide stable estimates of dose sensitivities.

We introduce a three-dimensional (3D) fully tensor train (TT)-assembled isogeometric analysis (IGA) framework, TT-IGA, for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) on complex geometries. Our method reformulates IGA discrete operators into TT format, enabling efficient compression and computation while retaining geometric flexibility and accuracy. Unlike previous low-rank approaches that typically rely on structured domains, our framework accommodates general 3D geometries through low-rank TT representations of both the geometry mapping and the PDE discretization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TT-IGA framework on the 3D Poisson equation, achieving substantial reductions in memory usage and computational cost without compromising solution quality.

In this paper, we study the finite-time blow-up for classical solutions of the 3D incompressible Euler equations with low-regularity initial vorticity. Applying the self-similar method and stability analysis of the self-similar system in critical Sobolev space, we prove that the vorticity of the axi-symmetric 3D Euler equations develops a finite-time singularity with certain scaling indices. Furthermore, we investigate the time integrability of the solutions. The proof is based on the new observations for the null structure of the transport term, and the parameter stability of the fundamental self-similar models.

Rich Vehicle Routing Problem with diverse Vertices allowing Hierarchical and Multimodal Time-Dependant Transhipment of multiple Node- Vehicle- compatible Cargo with Cascaded Time-Minimization Objective for Emergency Decision Support Systems

Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Systems and Control (eess.SY)
A rich vehicle routing problem is considered allowing multiple trips of heterogeneous vehicles stationed at distributed vehicle depots spread across diverse geographies having access to different modes of transportation. The problem arises from the real world requirement of optimizing the disaster response/preparedness time and minimizes the route duration of the vehicles to achieve the solution with the minimum highest-vehicle-route-duration. Multiple diversely-functional vertices are considered including the concept of Transhipment Ports as inter-modal resource transfer stations. Both simultaneous and split pickup and transferring of different types of delivery and pickup cargo is considered, along with Vehicle-Cargo and Transhipment Port-Cargo Compatibility. The superiority of the proposed cascaded minimization approach is shown over existing makespan minimization approaches through the developed MILP formulation. To solve the problem quickly for practical implementation within Disaster Management-specific Decision Support Systems, an extensive Heuristic Algorithm is devised. The Heuristic utilizes Decision Tree based structuring of possible routes and is able to inherently consider the compatibility issues. Preferential generation of small route elements are performed, which are integrated into route clusters; we consider multiple different logical integration approaches, as well as shuffling the logics to simultaneously produce multiple independent solutions. Finally perturbation of the different solutions are done to find better neighbouring solutions. The computational performance of the PSR-GIP Heuristic, on our created novel datasets, indicate that it is able to give good solutions swiftly for practical problems involving large integer instances which the MILP is unable to solve.

We study the structure of eigenfunctions of the Laplacian on quantum graphs, with a particular focus on Morse eigenfunctions via nodal and Neumann domains. Building on Courant-type arguments, we establish upper bounds for the number of nodal points and explore conditions under which Neumann domains of eigenfunctions correspond to minimizers to a class of spectral partition problems often known as spectral minimal partitions. The main focus will be the analysis on tree graphs, where we characterize the spectral energies of such partitions and relate them to the eigenvalues of the Laplacian under genericity assumptions. Notably, we introduce a notion analogous to Courant-sharpness for Neumann counts and demonstrate when spectral minimal partitions coincide with partitions formed by Neumann domains of eigenfunctions.

An algorithm for Aubert-Zelevinsky duality à la Mœglin-Waldspurger

Representation Theory (math.RT); Number Theory (math.NT)
Let $F$ be a locally compact non-Archimedean field of characteristic $0$, and let $G$ be either the split special orthogonal group $\mathrm{SO}_{2n+1}(F)$ or the symplectic group $\mathrm{Sp}_{2n}(F)$. The goal of this paper is to give an explicit description of the Aubert-Zelevinsky duality for $G$ in terms of Langlands parameters. We present a new algorithm, inspired by the Moeglin-Waldspurger algorithm for $\mathrm{GL}_n(F)$, which computes the dual Langlands data in a recursive and combinatorial way. Our method is simple enough to be carried out by hand and provides a practical tool for explicit computations. Interestingly, the algorithm was discovered with the help of machine learning tools, guiding us toward patterns that led to its formulation.

Investigating the Performance of EKF, UKF, and PF for Quadrotor Position Estimation in Hurricane Wind Disturbances

Subjects:
Dynamical Systems (math.DS)
Natural disasters, such as hurricanes and typhoons, pose significant challenges to public safety and infrastructure. While government agencies rely on multi million dollar UAV systems for storm data collection and disaster response, smaller drones lack the ability to autonomously adapt to rapidly changing environmental conditions, such as turbulent winds. This project investigates the implementation of advanced state estimation filters, Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF), and Particle Filter (PF), to enhance the control and adaptability of quadrotor drones in uncertain wind profiles modeled by Von Karman turbulence. While the EKF relies on linearization techniques using the Taylor series expansion, which can struggle under high nonlinearity, the UKF leverages sigma points for better performance in nonlinear systems without requiring Jacobian computations. The PF, on the other hand, addresses non-Gaussian noise and severe nonlinearities by employing a large number of particles, albeit at a high computational cost. To enhance accuracy and minimize estimation errors, a genetic algorithm (GA) was employed to optimally tune the process and measurement noise covariances (Q and R matrices) as well as UKF specific parameters alpha, beta, and kappa. This study highlights the tradeoff between accuracy, computational efficiency, and smoothing capabilities across these filters. Despite its robustness, the PF suffered from computational inefficiencies due to the high state dimensionality, while the EKF demonstrated faster computation but lower adaptability in nonlinear conditions. The UKF emerged as a balanced approach, achieving superior performance in capturing dynamic wind disturbances.

We characterize the integral Hasse principle for an infinite family of spherical stacky curves with genus $g\in [2/3,1)$ that are defined using generalized Fermat equations, extending a result of Darmon and Granville. We then apply our methods to find that a positive proportion of curves in our family satisfy the integral Hasse principle.

The Stochastic Weighted Particle Method (SWPM) of Rjasanow and Wagner is a generalization of the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo method for computing the probability density function of the velocities of a system of interacting particles for applications that include rarefied gas dynamics and plasma processing systems. Key components of a SWPM simulation are a particle grouping technique and particle reduction scheme. These are periodically applied to reduce the computational cost of simulations due to the gradual increase in the number of stochastic particles. A general framework for designing particle reduction schemes is introduced that enforces the preservation of a prescribed set of moments of the distribution through the construction and explicit solution of a system of linear equations for particle weights in terms of particle velocities and the moments to be preserved. This framework is applied to preserve all moments of the distribution up to order three. Numerical simulations are performed to verify the scheme and quantify the degree to which even higher-order moments and tail functionals are preserved. These results reveal an unexpected trade off between the preservation of these higher-order moments and tail functionals.

Forward Euler for Wasserstein Gradient Flows: Breakdown and Regularization
Yewei Xu, Qin Li
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA); Optimization and Control (math.OC)
Wasserstein gradient flows have become a central tool for optimization problems over probability measures. A natural numerical approach is forward-Euler time discretization. We show, however, that even in the simple case where the energy functional is the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence against a smooth target density, forward-Euler can fail dramatically: the scheme does not converge to the gradient flow, despite the fact that the first variation $\nabla\frac{\delta F}{\delta\rho}$ remains formally well defined at every step. We identify the root cause as a loss of regularity induced by the discretization, and prove that a suitable regularization of the functional restores the necessary smoothness, making forward-Euler a viable solver that converges in discrete time to the global minimizer.

Representation Theory (math.RT); Combinatorics (math.CO)
The study of modular representation theory of the double covering groups of the symmetric and alternating groups reveals rich and subtle combinatorial and algebraic phenomena involving their irreducible characters and the structure of their p-blocks, where p is an odd prime number. In this paper, we investigate the action of certain Galois automorphisms, those that act on p'-roots of unity by a power of p, on spin characters, with an emphasis on their interaction with perfect isometries and block theory. In particular, we prove that perfect isometries constructed by the first author and J.\,B. Gramain in \cite{BrGr3}, which were used to establish a weaker form of the Kessar--Schaps conjecture, remain preserved under this Galois action whenever certain natural compatibility conditions occur.

Spectral properties of random perturbations of non-normal Toeplitz matrices
Anirban Basak
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Spectral Theory (math.SP)
Spectral properties of Toeplitz operators and their finite truncations have long been central in operator theory. In the finite dimensional, non-normal setting, the spectrum is notoriously unstable under perturbations. Random perturbations provide a natural framework for studying this instability and identifying spectral features that emerge in typical noisy situations. This article surveys recent advances on the spectral behavior of (polynomially vanishing) random perturbations of Toeplitz matrices, focusing mostly on the limiting spectral distribution, the distribution of outliers, and localization of eigenvectors, and highlight the major techniques used to study these problems. We complement the survey with new results on the limiting spectral distribution of polynomially vanishing random perturbation of Toeplitz matrices with continuous symbols, on the limiting spectral distribution of finitely banded Toeplitz matrices under exponentially and super-exponentially vanishing random perturbations, and on the complete localization of outlier eigenvectors of randomly perturbed Jordan blocks.

We prove comparison theorems for the horizontal Laplacian of the Riemannian distance in the context of Riemannian foliations with minimal leaves.

The comparison theorems yield a Bonnet-Myers type theorem, stochastic completeness and Lipschitz regularization property for the sub-Riemannian semigroup.

De Finetti + Sanov = Bayes
Nicholas G. Polson, Daniel Zantedeschi
Comments:
20 pages
Subjects:
Statistics Theory (math.ST); Methodology (stat.ME)
We develop a framework for the operationalization of models and parameters by combining de Finetti's representation theorem with a conditional form of Sanov's theorem. This synthesis, the tilted de Finetti theorem, shows that conditioning exchangeable sequences on empirical moment constraints yields predictive laws in exponential families via the I-projection of a baseline measure. Parameters emerge as limits of empirical functionals, providing a probabilistic foundation for maximum entropy (MaxEnt) principles. This explains why exponential tilting governs likelihood methods and Bayesian updating, connecting naturally to finite-sample concentration rates that anticipate PAC-Bayes bounds. Examples include Gaussian scale mixtures, where symmetry uniquely selects location-scale families, and Jaynes' Brandeis dice problem, where partial information tilts the uniform law. Broadly, the theorem unifies exchangeability, large deviations, and entropy concentration, clarifying the ubiquity of exponential families and MaxEnt's role as the inevitable predictive limit under partial information.

Signature 0 toric varieties, wall crossings, and cross polytope-like structures
Soohyun Park
Comments:
53 pages
Subjects:
Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Combinatorics (math.CO); Geometric Topology (math.GT)
We describe the structure of simplicial locally convex fans associated to even-dimensional complete toric varieties with signature 0. They belong to the set of such toric varieties whose even degree Betti numbers yield a gamma vector equal to 0. The gamma vector is an invariant of palindromic polynomials whose nonnegativity lies between unimodality and real-rootedness. It is expected that the cases where the gamma vector is 0 form ``building blocks'' among those where it is nonnegative. This means minimality with respect to a certain restricted class of blowups. However, this equality to 0 case is currently poorly understood.
For such toric varieties, we address this situation using wall crossings. The links of the fan come from a repeated suspension of the maximal linear subspace in its realization in the ambient space of the fan. Conversely, the centers of these links containing any particular line form a cone or a repeated suspension of one. The intersection patterns between these ``anchoring'' linear subspaces come from how far certain submodularity inequalities are from equality and parity conditions on their dimensions. This involves linear dependence and containment relations between them. We obtain these relations by viewing the vanishing of certain mixed volumes from the perspective of the exponents. Finally, these wall crossings yield a simple method of generating induced 4-cycles expected to cover the minimal objects described above.

Let $G$ be a reductive algebraic group defined over a non-Archimedean local field $F$ of residue characteristic $p$. Let $\sigma$ be an automorphism of $G$ of order $\ell$ -- a prime number -- with $\ell\neq p$. Let $\Pi$ be a finite length $\overline{\mathbb{F}}_\ell$-representation of $G(F)\rtimes \langle\sigma\rangle$. We show that the Tate cohomology $\widehat{H}^i(\langle\sigma\rangle, \Pi)$ is a finite length representation of $G^\sigma(F)$. We give an application to genericity of these Tate cohomology spaces.

Attenuation of long waves through regions of irregular floating ice and bathymetry
Lloyd Dafydd, Richard Porter
Subjects:
Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn); Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
Existing theoretical results for attenuation of surface waves propagating on water of random fluctuating depth are shown to over predict the rate of decay due to the way in which ensemble averaging is performed. A revised approach is presented which corrects this and is shown to conserve energy. New theoretical predictions are supported by numerical results which use averaging of simulations of wave scattering over finite sections of random bathymetry for which transfer matrix eigenvalues are used to accurately measure decay. The model of wave propagation used in this paper is derived from a linearised long wavelength assumption whereby depth averaging leads to time harmonic waves being represented as solutions to a simple ordinary differential equation. In this paper it is shown how this can be adapted to incorporate a model of a continuous covering of the surface by fragmented floating ice. Attenuation of waves through broken ice of random thickness is then analysed in a similar manner as bed variations previously and some comparisons are made with published field data for attenuation of waves in the marginal ice zones. Key features of the data are reproduced by theory including the attenuation being proportional to a power of frequency between 2 and 4 as well as capturing the "roll-over effect" at high frequencies.

The recent work of Dafydd and Porter [2024] on the attenuation of waves propagating through floating broken ice of random thickness is extended to consider water of non-shallow depth. A theoretical model of broken floating ice is analysed using a multiple scales analysis to provide an explicit expression for the attenuation of waves as they propagate from a region of constant thickness ice into a semi-infinite region of ice whose thickness is a slowly-varying random function of distance. Theoretical predictions are shown to compare well to numerical simulations of scattering over long finite regions of ice of randomly-varying thickness computed from an approximate depth-averaged model derived under a mild-slope assumption. The theory predicts a low-frequency attenuation proportional to the eighth power of frequency and a roll-over effect at higher frequencies. The relationship between the results and field measurements are discussed.

Four-derivative heterotic supergravity (without gauge fields) reduced on a $p$-dimensional torus leads to half-maximal supergravity coupled to $p$ vector multiplets, and it is known that removing the vector multiplets is a consistent truncation of the theory. We find a new consistent truncation of four-derivative heterotic supergravity on a torus that keeps the vector multiplets and precisely reproduces the bosonic action of heterotic supergravity (with heterotic gauge fields). We show that both truncations have an $O(d+p,d)$ symmetry when reduced on a $d$-dimensional torus and demonstrate how this embeds in the $O(d+p,d+p)$ symmetry that one gets from reducing on a $(d+p)$-dimensional torus without truncation. We then use our new truncation to obtain four-derivative corrections to the Kerr-Sen solution and compute thermodynamic quantities and multipole moments. Finally, we compare the Kerr-Sen solutions of the actions corresponding to the two different choices of truncation with the Kerr solution, the Kerr-Newman solution, and each other, and show that they have distinct four-derivative multipole structures.

This paper investigates a behavioral-feedback SIR model in which the infection rate adapts dynamically based on the fractions of susceptible and infected individuals. We introduce an invariant of motion and we characterize the peak of infection. We further examine the system under a threshold constraint on the infection level. Based on this analysis, we formulate an optimal control problem to keep the infection curve below a healthcare capacity threshold while minimizing the economic cost. For this problem, we study a feasible strategy that involves applying the minimal necessary restrictions to meet the capacity constraint and characterize the corresponding cost.

New generalized unit distributions based on order statistics

Subjects:

In the present paper, the author discusses the derivation of unit distributions and the derivation of the generalized form using the order statistics. The author discusses the Kumaraswamy as the smallest order statistic of the unit power distribution derived from the inverse Weibull distribution. The author discusses the unit Rayleigh distribution and how it can be generalized using the smallest, largest, and kth order statistics. Using the order statistics to generalize a distribution differs from other techniques like the power transformation and T-X family (transformed-transformer) method. For the discussed distribution, the author demonstrates the basic functions and properties with real data analysis.

Higher-form symmetry in a tensor product Hilbert space is always emergent: the symmetry generators become genuinely topological only when the Gauss law is energetically enforced at low energies. In this paper, we present a general method for defining the 't Hooft anomaly of higher-form symmetries in lattice models built on a tensor product Hilbert space. In (2+1)D, for given Gauss law operators realized by finite-depth circuits that generate a finite 1-form $G$ symmetry, we construct an index representing a cohomology class in $H^4(B^2G, U(1))$, which characterizes the corresponding 't Hooft anomaly. This construction generalizes the Else-Nayak characterization of 0-form symmetry anomalies. More broadly, under the assumption of a specified formulation of the $p$-form $G$ symmetry action and Hilbert space structure in arbitrary $d$ spatial dimensions, we show how to characterize the 't Hooft anomaly of the symmetry action by an index valued in $H^{d+2}(B^{p+1}G, U(1))$.

We prove that $S(5) = 47,176,870$ using the Coq proof assistant. The Busy Beaver value $S(n)$ is the maximum number of steps that an $n$-state 2-symbol Turing machine can perform from the all-zero tape before halting, and $S$ was historically introduced by Tibor Radó in 1962 as one of the simplest examples of an uncomputable function. The proof enumerates $181,385,789$ Turing machines with 5 states and, for each machine, decides whether it halts or not. Our result marks the first determination of a new Busy Beaver value in over 40 years and the first Busy Beaver value ever to be formally verified, attesting to the effectiveness of massively collaborative online research (this http URL).

The maximal gauged supergravities in five spacetime dimensions with gauge groups contained in $\mathbb{R}^+ \times \textrm{E}_{6(6)}$ are described. The $\textrm{E}_{6(6)}$ factor is the duality group of ungauged maximal supergravity and $\mathbb{R}^+$ is the scaling symmetry of the five-dimensional metric, usually called the \textit{trombone} symmetry. The equations of motion and supersymmetry variations for these supergravities are given to lowest order in fermions, and the mass matrices are provided. Then, the theories with gauge groups contained in a maximal subgroup of $\mathbb{R}^+ \times \textrm{E}_{6(6)}$ are classified, and a new family of such supergravities uncovered. For a concrete theory in this class, some supersymmetric anti-de Sitter vacua are found and their mass spectra computed within the gauged supergravity. These vacua are argued to be related to superconformal phases of the M5-brane field theory.

System Reliability Estimation via Shrinkage
Beidi Qiang, Edsel Pena
Subjects:
Methodology (stat.ME); Statistics Theory (math.ST)
In a coherent reliability system composed of multiple components configured according to a specific structure function, the distribution of system time to failure, or system lifetime, is often of primary interest. Accurate estimation of system reliability is critical in a wide range of engineering and industrial applications, forming decisions in system design, maintenance planning, and risk assessment. The system lifetime distribution can be estimated directly using the observed system failure times. However, when component-level lifetime data is available, it can yield improved estimates of system reliability. In this work, we demonstrate that under nonparametric assumptions about the component time-to-failure distributions, traditional estimators such as the Product-Limit Estimator (PLE) can be further improved under specific loss functions. We propose a novel methodology that enhances the nonparametric system reliability estimation through a shrinkage transformation applied to component-level estimators. This shrinkage approach leads to improved efficiency in estimating system reliability.

Nonlocal Neural Tangent Kernels via Parameter-Space Interactions
Sriram Nagaraj, Vishakh Hari
Subjects:
Machine Learning (cs.LG); Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
The Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) framework has provided deep insights into the training dynamics of neural networks under gradient flow. However, it relies on the assumption that the network is differentiable with respect to its parameters, an assumption that breaks down when considering non-smooth target functions or parameterized models exhibiting non-differentiable behavior. In this work, we propose a Nonlocal Neural Tangent Kernel (NNTK) that replaces the local gradient with a nonlocal interaction-based approximation in parameter space. Nonlocal gradients are known to exist for a wider class of functions than the standard gradient. This allows NTK theory to be extended to nonsmooth functions, stochastic estimators, and broader families of models. We explore both fixed-kernel and attention-based formulations of this nonlocal operator. We illustrate the new formulation with numerical studies.

Finite-Agent Stochastic Differential Games on Large Graphs: II. Graph-Based Architectures

Subjects:
Machine Learning (cs.LG); Computer Science and Game Theory (cs.GT); Optimization and Control (math.OC)
We propose a novel neural network architecture, called Non-Trainable Modification (NTM), for computing Nash equilibria in stochastic differential games (SDGs) on graphs. These games model a broad class of graph-structured multi-agent systems arising in finance, robotics, energy, and social dynamics, where agents interact locally under uncertainty. The NTM architecture imposes a graph-guided sparsification on feedforward neural networks, embedding fixed, non-trainable components aligned with the underlying graph topology. This design enhances interpretability and stability, while significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters in large-scale, sparse settings. We theoretically establish a universal approximation property for NTM in static games on graphs and numerically validate its expressivity and robustness through supervised learning tasks. Building on this foundation, we incorporate NTM into two state-of-the-art game solvers, Direct Parameterization and Deep BSDE, yielding their sparse variants (NTM-DP and NTM-DBSDE). Numerical experiments on three SDGs across various graph structures demonstrate that NTM-based methods achieve performance comparable to their fully trainable counterparts, while offering improved computational efficiency.

An exact tau-leaping method

Subjects:
Molecular Networks (q-bio.MN); Probability (math.PR)
The Gillespie algorithm and its extensions are commonly used for the simulation of chemical reaction networks. A limitation of these algorithms is that they have to process and update the system after every reaction, requiring significant computation. Another class of algorithms, based on the tau-leaping method, is able to simulate multiple reactions at a time at the cost of decreased accuracy. We present a new algorithm for the exact simulation of chemical reaction networks that is capable of sampling multiple reactions at a time via a first-order approximation similarly to the tau-leaping methods. We prove that the algorithm has an improved runtime complexity compared to existing methods for the exact simulation of chemical reaction networks, and present an efficient and easy to use implementation that outperforms existing methods in practice.

In this paper, we propose a sustainable long short-term memory (LSTM)-based precoding framework for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted millimeter-wave (mmWave) MIMO systems. Instead of explicit channel state information (CSI) estimation, the framework exploits uplink pilot sequences to implicitly learn channel characteristics, reducing both pilot overhead and inference complexity. Practical hardware constraints are addressed by incorporating the phase-dependent amplitude model of RIS elements, while a multi-label training strategy improves robustness when multiple near-optimal codewords yield comparable performance. Simulations show that the proposed design achieves over 90% of the spectral efficiency of exhaustive search (ES) with only 2.2% of its computation time, cutting energy consumption by nearly two orders of magnitude. The method also demonstrates resilience under distribution mismatch and scalability to larger RIS arrays, making it a practical and energy-efficient solution for sustainable 6G wireless networks.

Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) leverage machine learning with differential equations to solve direct and inverse problems, ensuring predictions follow physical laws. Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling advances beyond classical compartmental approaches by using a mechanistic, physiology focused framework. A PBPK model is based on a system of ODEs, with each equation representing the mass balance of a drug in a compartment, such as an organ or tissue. These ODEs include parameters that reflect physiological, biochemical, and drug-specific characteristics to simulate how the drug moves through the body. In this paper, we introduce PBPK-iPINN, a method to estimate drug-specific or patient-specific parameters and drug concentration profiles in PBPK brain compartment models using inverse PINNs. We demonstrate that, for the inverse problem to converge to the correct solution, the loss function components (data loss, initial conditions loss, and residual loss) must be appropriately weighted, and parameters (including number of layers, number of neurons, activation functions, learning rate, optimizer, and collocation points) must be carefully tuned. The performance of the PBPK-iPINN approach is then compared with established traditional numerical and statistical methods.

Understanding the dynamical structure of cislunar space beyond geosynchronous orbit is critical for both lunar exploration and for high-Earth-orbiting trajectories. In this study, we investigate the role of mean-motion resonances and their associated heteroclinic connections in enabling natural semi-major axis transport in the Earth-Moon system. Working within the planar circular restricted three-body problem, we compute and analyze families of periodic orbits associated with the interior 4:1, 3:1, and 2:1 lunar resonances. These families exhibit a rich bifurcation structure, including transitions between prograde and retrograde branches and connections through collision orbits. We construct stable and unstable manifolds of the unstable resonant orbits using a perigee-based Poincaré map, and identify heteroclinic connections - both between resonant orbits and with lunar $L_1$ libration-point orbits - across a range of Jacobi constant values. Using a new generalized distance metric to quantify the closeness between trajectories, we establish operational times-of-flight for such heteroclinic-type orbit-to-orbit transfers. These connections reveal ballistic, zero-$\Delta v$ pathways that achieve major orbit changes within reasonable times-of-flight, thus defining a network of accessible semi-major axes. Our results provide a new dynamical framework for long-term spacecraft evolution and cislunar mission design, particularly in regimes where lunar gravity strongly perturbs high Earth orbits.

Power-Dominance in Estimation Theory: A Third Pathological Axis

This paper introduces a novel framework for estimation theory by introducing a second-order diagnostic for estimator design. While classical analysis focuses on the bias-variance trade-off, we present a more foundational constraint. This result is model-agnostic, domain-agnostic, and is valid for both parametric and non-parametric problems, Bayesian and frequentist frameworks. We propose to classify the estimators into three primary power regimes. We theoretically establish that any estimator operating in the `power-dominant regime' incurs an unavoidable mean-squared error penalty, making it structurally prone to sub-optimal performance. We propose a `safe-zone law' and make this diagnostic intuitive through two safe-zone maps. One map is a geometric visualization analogous to a receiver operating characteristic curve for estimators, and the other map shows that the safe-zone corresponds to a bounded optimization problem, while the forbidden `power-dominant zone' represents an unbounded optimization landscape. This framework reframes estimator design as a path optimization problem, providing new theoretical underpinnings for regularization and inspiring novel design philosophies.

Low-Altitude UAV Tracking via Sensing-Assisted Predictive Beamforming

Sensing-assisted predictive beamforming, as one of the enabling technologies for emerging integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) paradigm, shows significant promise for enhancing various future unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) applications. However, current works predominately emphasized on spectral efficiency enhancement, while the impact of such beamforming techniques on the communication reliability was largely unexplored and challenging to characterize. To fill this research gap and tackle this issue, this paper investigates outage capacity maximization for UAV tracking under the sensing-assisted predictive beamforming scheme. Specifically, a cellular-connected UAV tracking scheme is proposed leveraging extended Kalman filtering (EKF), where the predicted UAV trajectory, sensing duration ratio, and target constant received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are jointly optimized to maximize the outage capacity at each time slot. To address the implicit nature of the objective function, closed-form approximations of the outage probabilities (OPs) at both prediction and measurement stages of each time slot are proposed based on second-order Taylor expansions, providing an efficient and full characterization of outage capacity. Subsequently, an efficient algorithm is proposed based on a combination of bisection search and successive convex approximation (SCA) to address the non-convex optimization problem with guaranteed convergence. To further reduce computational complexity, a second efficient algorithm is developed based on alternating optimization (AO). Simulation results validate the accuracy of the derived OP approximations, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, and the significant outage capacity enhancement over various benchmarks, while also indicating a trade-off between decreasing path loss and enjoying wide beam coverage for outage capacity maximization.

On the model attractor in a high-dimensional neural network dynamics of reservoir computing

Subjects:

The theory of embedding and generalized synchronization in reservoir computing has recently been developed. Under ideal conditions, reservoir computing exhibits generalized synchronization during the learning process. These insights form a rigorous basis for understanding reservoir computing ability to reconstruct and predict complex dynamics. In this study, we clarified the dynamical system structures of generalized synchronization and embedding by comparing the Lyapunov exponents of a high dimensional neural network within the reservoir computing model with those in actual systems. Furthermore, we numerically calculated the Lyapunov exponents restricted to the tangent space of the inertial manifold in a high dimensional neural network. Our results demonstrate that all Lyapunov exponents of the actual dynamics, including negative ones, are successfully identified.

Myopic optimization (MO) outperforms reinforcement learning (RL) in portfolio management: RL yields lower or negative returns, higher variance, larger costs, heavier CVaR, lower profitability, and greater model risk. We model execution/liquidation frictions with mark-to-market accounting. Using Malliavin calculus (Clark-Ocone/BEL), we derive policy gradients and risk shadow price, unifying HJB and KKT. This gives dual gap and convergence results: geometric MO vs. RL floors. We quantify phantom profit in RL via Malliavin policy-gradient contamination analysis and define a control-affects-dynamics (CAD) premium of RL indicating plausibly positive.

Fast reconstruction of degenerate populations of conductance-based neuron models from spike times

Neurons communicate through spikes, and spike timing is a crucial part of neuronal processing. Spike times can be recorded experimentally both intracellularly and extracellularly, and are the main output of state-of-the-art neural probes. On the other hand, neuronal activity is controlled at the molecular level by the currents generated by many different transmembrane proteins called ion channels. Connecting spike timing to ion channel composition remains an arduous task to date. To address this challenge, we developed a method that combines deep learning with a theoretical tool called Dynamic Input Conductances (DICs), which reduce the complexity of ion channel interactions into three interpretable components describing how neurons spike. Our approach uses deep learning to infer DICs directly from spike times and then generates populations of "twin" neuron models that replicate the observed activity while capturing natural variability in membrane channel composition. The method is fast, accurate, and works using only spike recordings. We also provide open-source software with a graphical interface, making it accessible to researchers without programming expertise.

Ellipsoidal tube-based model predictive control methods effectively account for the propagation of the reachable set, typically employing linear feedback policies. In contrast, scenario-based approaches offer more flexibility in the feedback structure by considering different control actions for different branches of a scenario tree. However, they face challenges in ensuring rigorous guarantees. This work aims to integrate the strengths of both methodologies by enhancing ellipsoidal tube-based MPC with a scenario tree formulation. The uncertainty ellipsoids are partitioned by halfspaces such that each partitioned set can be controlled independently. The proposed ellipsoidal multi-stage approach is demonstrated in a human-robot system, highlighting its advantages in handling uncertainty while maintaining computational tractability.

Between proportionnality and envy-freeness: k-proportionality
Guillaume Chèze (UT)
Subjects:
Multiagent Systems (cs.MA); Computer Science and Game Theory (cs.GT); Combinatorics (math.CO)
This article deals with the cake cutting problem. In this setting, there exists two notions of fair division: proportional division (when there are n players, each player thinks to get at least 1/n of the cake) and envy-free division (each player wants to keep his or her share because he or she does not envy the portion given to another player). Some results are valid for proportional division but not for envy-free division.
Here, we introduce and study a scale between the proportional division and the envy-free division. The goal is to understand where is the gap between statements about proportional division and envy-free division. This scale comes from the notion introduced in this article: k-proportionality. When k = n this notion corresponds to the proportional division and when k = 2 it corresponds to envy-free division. With k-proportionality we can understand where some difficulties in fair division lie. First, we show that there are situations in which there is no k-proportional and equitable division of a pie with connected pieces when k $\le$ n -1. This result was known only for envy-free division, ie k = 2. Next, we prove that there are situations in which there is no Pareto-optimal k-proportional division of a cake with connected pieces when k $\le$ n -1. This result was known only for k = 2. These theorems say that we can get an impossibility result even if we do not consider an envy-free division but a weaker notion. Finally, k-proportionality allows to give a generalization with a uniform statement of theorems about strong envy-free and strong proportional divisions.

Least squares estimation of the transition density in bifurcating Markov models

Subjects:

In this article, we propose a least squares method for the estimation of the transition density in bifurcating Markov models. Unlike the kernel estimation, this method do not use the quotient which can be a source of errors. In order to study the rate of convergence for least squares estimators, we develop exponential inequalities for empirical process of bifurcating Markov chain under bracketing assumption. Unlike the classical processes, we observe that for bifurcating Markov chains, the complexity parameter depends on the ergodicity rate and as consequence, we have that the convergence rate of our estimator is a function of the ergodicity rate. We conclude with a numerical study to validate our theoretical results.

The uniqueness of purifications of quantum states on a system $A$ up to local unitary transformations on a purifying system $B$ is central to quantum information theory. We show that, if the two systems are modelled by commuting von Neumann algebras $M_A$ and $M_B$ on a Hilbert space $\mathcal H$, then uniqueness of purifications is equivalent to Haag duality $M_A = M_B'$. In particular, the uniqueness of purifications can fail in systems with infinitely many degrees of freedom -- even when $M_A$ and $M_B$ are commuting factors that jointly generate $B(\mathcal H)$ and hence allow for local tomography of all density matrices on $\mathcal H$.

Efficient Compilation of Algorithms into Compact Linear Programs

Linear Programming (LP) is widely applied in industry and is a key component of various other mathematical problem-solving techniques. Recent work introduced an LP compiler translating polynomial-time, polynomial-space algorithms into polynomial-size LPs using intuitive high-level programming languages, offering a promising alternative to manually specifying each set of constraints through Algebraic Modeling Languages (AMLs). However, the resulting LPs, while polynomial in size, are often extremely large, posing challenges for existing LP solvers. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for generating substantially smaller LPs from algorithms. Our goal is to establish minimum-size compact LP formulations for problems in P having natural formulations with exponential extension complexities. Our broader vision is to enable the systematic generation of Compact Integer Programming (CIP) formulations for problems with exponential-size IPs having polynomial-time separation oracles. To this end, we introduce a hierarchical linear pipelining technique that decomposes nested program structures into synchronized regions with well-defined execution transitions -- functions of compile-time parameters. This decomposition allows us to localize LP constraints and variables within each region, significantly reducing LP size without the loss of generality, ensuring the resulting LP remains valid for all inputs of size $n$. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on two benchmark problems -- the makespan problem, which has exponential extension complexity, and the weighted minimum spanning tree problem -- both of which have exponential-size natural LPs. Our results show up to a $25$-fold reduction in LP size and substantial improvements in solver performance across both commercial and non-commercial LP solvers.

Strong functors and monads are ubiquitous in Computer Science. More recently, comonads have demonstrated their use in structuring context-dependent notions of computation. However, the dualisation of ``being strong'' property passed somehow unobserved so far. We argue that ``being costrong'' gives a different understanding of how functors can interact with monoidal structures. This work in progress aims to explore costrong functors and their natural properties, with an eye towards the semantics of computations.

Optimal Annuitization with stochastic mortality: Piecewise Deterministic Mortality Force

This paper addresses the problem of determining the optimal time for an individual to convert retirement savings into a lifetime annuity. The individual invests their wealth into a dividend-paying fund that follows the dynamics of a geometric Brownian motion, exposing them to market risk. At the same time, they face an uncertain lifespan influenced by a stochastic mortality force. The latter is modelled as a piecewise deterministic Markov process (PDMP), which captures sudden and unpredictable changes in the individual's mortality force. The individual aims to maximise expected lifetime linear utility from consumption and bequest, balancing market risk and longevity risk under an irreversible, all-or-nothing annuitization decision. The problem is formulated as a three-dimensional optimal stopping problem and, by exploiting the PDMP structure, it is reduced to a sequence of nested one-dimensional problems. We solve the optimal stopping problem and find a rich structure for the optimal annuitization rule, which cover all parameter specifications. Our theoretical analysis is complemented by a numerical example illustrating the impact of a single health shock on annuitization timing, along with a sensitivity analysis of key model parameters.

An elementary proof that linking problems are hard

We give a new, elementary proof of what we believe is the simplest known example of a ``natural'' problem in computational 3-dimensional topology that is $\mathsf{NP}$-hard -- namely, the \emph{Trivial Sublink Problem}: given a diagram $L$ of a link in $S^3$ and a positive integer $k$, decide if $L$ contains a $k$ component sublink that is trivial. This problem was previously shown to be $\mathsf{NP}$-hard in independent works of Koenig-Tsvietkova and de Mesmay-Rieck-Sedgwick-Tancer, both of which used reductions from $\mathsf{3SAT}$. The reduction we describe instead starts with the Independent Set Problem, and allows us to avoid the use of Brunnian links such as the Borromean rings. On the technical level, this entails a new conceptual insight: the Trivial Sublink Problem is hard entirely due to mod 2 pairwise linking, with no need for integral or higher order linking. On the pedagogical level, the reduction we describe is entirely elementary, and thus suitable for introducing undergraduates and non-experts to complexity-theoretic low-dimensional topology. To drive this point home, in this work we assume no familiarity with low-dimensional topology, and -- other than Reidemeister's Theorem and Karp's result that the Clique Problem is $\mathsf{NP}$-hard -- we provide more-or-less complete definitions and proofs. We have also constructed a web app that accompanies this work and allows a user to visualize the new reduction interactively.

Asymptotic velocity domination (AVD) posits that when back-propagated to the Big Bang generic cosmological spacetimes solve a drastically simplified version of the Einstein field equations, where all dynamical spatial gradients are absent (similar as in the Belinski-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz scenario). Conversely, a solution can in principle be reconstructed from its behavior near the Big Bang. This property has been rigorously proven for the Gowdy class of cosmologies, both polarized and unpolarized. Here we establish for the polarized case a quantum version of the AVD property formulated in terms of two-point functions of (the integrands of) Dirac observables: these correlators approach their much simpler velocity dominated counterparts when the time support is back-propagated to the Big Bang. Conversely, the full correlators can be expressed as a uniformly convergent series in averaged spatial gradients of the velocity dominated ones.

Concentration inequalities for semidefinite least squares based on data

We study data-driven least squares (LS) problems with semidefinite (SD) constraints and derive finite-sample guarantees on the spectrum of their optimal solutions when these constraints are relaxed. In particular, we provide a high confidence bound allowing one to solve a simpler program in place of the full SDLS problem, while ensuring that the eigenvalues of the resulting solution are $\varepsilon$-close of those enforced by the SD constraints. The developed certificate, which consistently shrinks as the number of data increases, turns out to be easy-to-compute, distribution-free, and only requires independent and identically distributed samples. Moreover, when the SDLS is used to learn an unknown quadratic function, we establish bounds on the error between a gradient descent iterate minimizing the surrogate cost obtained with no SD constraints and the true minimizer.

Semiparametric Causal Inference for Right-Censored Outcomes with Many Weak Invalid Instruments

Subjects:
Methodology (stat.ME); Statistics Theory (math.ST)
We propose a semiparametric framework for causal inference with right-censored survival outcomes and many weak invalid instruments, motivated by Mendelian randomization in biobank studies where classical methods may fail. We adopt an accelerated failure time model and construct a moment condition based on augmented inverse probability of censoring weighting, incorporating both uncensored and censored observations. Under a heteroscedasticity-based condition on the treatment model, we establish point identification of the causal effect despite censoring and invalid instruments. We propose GEL-NOW (Generalized Empirical Likelihood with Non-Orthogonal and Weak moments) for valid inference under these conditions. A divergent number of Neyman orthogonal nuisance functions is estimated using deep neural networks. A key challenge is that the conditional censoring distribution is a non-Neyman orthogonal nuisance, contributing to the first-order asymptotics of the estimator for the target causal effect parameter. We derive the asymptotic distribution and explicitly incorporate this additional uncertainty into the asymptotic variance formula. We also introduce a censoring-adjusted over-identification test that accounts for this variance component. Simulation studies and UK Biobank applications demonstrate the method's robustness and practical utility.

We extend the recent proof of the Generalized Quantum Stein's Lemma by Hayashi and Yamasaki [arXiv:2408.02722] to classical-quantum (c-q) channels. We analyze the composite hypothesis testing problem of testing a c-q channel $\mathcal{E}^{\otimes n}$ against a sequence of sets of c-q channels $(\mathcal{S}_n)_n$ (satisfying certain natural assumptions), under parallel strategies. We prove that the optimal asymptotic asymmetric error exponent is given by the regularization of Umegaki channel divergence, minimized over $\mathcal{S}_n$. This allows us to prove the reversibility of resource theories of classical-quantum channels in a natural framework, where the distance between channels (and hence also the notion of approximate interconvertibility of channels) is measured in diamond norm, and the set of free operations is the set of all asymptotically resource non-generating superchannels. The results we obtain are similar to the ones in the concurrent and independent work by Hayashi and Yamasaki [arXiv:2509.07271]. However the proof of the direct part of the GQSL uses different arguments and techniques to deal with the challenges that arise from dealing with c-q channels.

A formal axiomatic mathematical framework for Boolos' Hardest Logic Puzzle Ever is presented and two theorems about its solvability are proved. By strictly following Boolos' instructions (in particular, the requirement that all gods are always obliged to answer), the novel concept of \textit{admissible questions} for the puzzle is introduced. It is then rigorously proved that Boolos' original puzzle can be solved, in an absolute deterministic way, in no less than three yes-no admissible questions. However, this does not mean that one could solve it in less than three admissible questions by just pure \emph{chance}. Hence, such probabilities are computed here as well.

Reflections from hypersurfaces act by symplectomorphisms on the space of oriented lines with respect to the canonical symplectic form. We consider an arbitrary $C^{\infty}$-smooth hypersurface $\gamma\subset\mathbb R^{n+1}$ that is either a global strictly convex closed hypersurface, or a germ of hypersurface. We deal with the pseudogroup generated by compositional ratios of reflections from $\gamma$ and of reflections from its small deformations. In the case, when $\gamma$ is a global convex hypersurface, we show that the latter pseudogroup is dense in the pseudogroup of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms between subdomains of the phase cylinder: the space of oriented lines intersecting $\gamma$ transversally. We prove an analogous local result in the case, when $\gamma$ is a germ. The derivatives of the above compositional differences in the deformation parameter are Hamiltonian vector fields calculated by Ron Perline. To prove the main results, we find the Lie algebra generated by them and prove its $C^{\infty}$-density in the Lie algebra of Hamiltonian vector fields. We also prove analogues of the above results for hypersurfaces in Riemannian manifolds.

This is a quasisymmetric analogue of the extensively studied problem of finding conditions on a pair of skew shapes that determine when the difference of their skew Schur functions is Schur-positive. We determine necessary conditions and separate sufficient conditions for $F$-positivity, and show that a broad operation for combining posets preserves positivity properties. We conclude with classes of posets for which we have conditions that are both necessary and sufficient.

Differential Geometry (math.DG)
We initiate a systematic study of cohomogeneity-one solitons in Bryant's Laplacian flow of closed G_2-structures on a 7-manifold, motivated by the problem of understanding finite-time singularities of that flow. Here we focus on solitons with symmetry groups Sp(2) and SU(3); in both cases we prove the existence of continuous families of local cohomogeneity-one gradient Laplacian solitons and characterise which of these local solutions extend smoothly over their unique singular orbits. The main questions are then to determine which of these smoothly-closing solutions extend to complete solitons and furthermore to understand the asymptotic geometry of these complete solitons.
We provide complete answers to both questions in the case of steady solitons. Up to the actions of scaling and discrete symmetries, we show that the set of all smoothly-closing SU(3)-invariant steady Laplacian solitons defined on a neighbourhood of the zero-section of the anti-self-dual bundle of CP^2 is parametrised by the set of nonnegative reals. An open interval I=(0,c) corresponds to complete nontrivial gradient solitons that are asymptotic to the unique SU(3)-invariant torsion-free G_2 cone. The boundary point 0 of I corresponds to the well-known Bryant--Salamon asymptotically conical G_2-manifold, while the other boundary point c corresponds to an explicit complete gradient steady soliton with exponential volume growth and novel asymptotic geometry. The open interval (c, oo) consists entirely of incomplete solutions.
In addition, we find an explicit complete gradient shrinking soliton on the anti-self-dual bundle of S^4 and CP^2. Both these shrinkers are asymptotic to closed but non-torsion-free G_2 cones. Like the nontrivial AC gradient steady solitons on the anti-self-dual bundle of CP^2, these shrinkers appear to be potential singularity models for finite-time singularities of Laplacian flow.

Global existence and pointwise decay for nonlinear waves under the null condition

Comments:

Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
This paper proves global existence and sharp pointwise decay for solutions to nonlinear wave equations satisfying the semilinear null condition, on a class of three-dimensional, asymptotically flat, and notably, non-stationary spacetimes. We consider nonlinearities satisfying a generalized null condition which does not necessarily retain its structure when commuted with vector fields. For sufficiently small initial data, and under the assumption that the underlying linear operator satisfies an integrated local energy decay estimate, we prove that solutions exist for all time and we establish sharp pointwise decay estimates for the solution $\phi$ and its vector-fields. The solution itself decays as $|\phi(t,x)| \lesssim \langle t+r \rangle^{-1} \langle t-r \rangle^{-1}$. This rate matches that of the linear equation on a flat background. This rate is sharp, as this behavior holds already for certain time-dependent perturbations of the classical null form on Minkowski space, which we specify.

Punctured tubular neighborhoods and stable homotopy at infinity

Comments:
Revised version. Comments welcome !
Subjects:
Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Algebraic Topology (math.AT)
In this revised version (August 2025), we add a survey of \infty-categorical (co)limits and a replacement lemma for higher functoriality (Lem. 1.4.5), a framework for explicit models of punctured tubular neighborhoods (§3.4), and a new theory of orientation classes for line bundles and Thom spaces of virtual bundles over singular curves (§5.1, 5.2). Building on this, we make explicit the normalization of the resulting isomorphisms, reformulate our main theorem (Th. 5.3.3) to incorporate orientation classes, and show how these choices yield quadratic Mumford matrices computed via Smith form over the Grothendieck-Witt ring of the base field. The appendices are expanded to give a better account of the notion of orientation classes, and to describe trace computations on Chow-Witt groups over possibly non-perfect fields. We warmly thank the referee for insightful comments that motivated us to make our approach much more precise and comprehensive.

We define essential commutative Cartan pairs of $C^*$-algebras generalising the definition of Renault and show that such pairs are given by essential twisted groupoid $C^*$-algebras as defined by Kwaśniewski and Meyer. We show that the underlying twisted groupoid is effective, and is unique up to isomorphism among twists over effective groupoids giving rise to the essential commutative Cartan pair. We also show that for twists over effective groupoids giving rise to such pairs, the automorphism group of the twist is isomorphic to the automorphism group of the induced essential Cartan pair via explicit constructions.

We demonstrate the existence of a piecewise linear homeomorphism $f$ of $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ which maps rationals to rationals, whose slopes are powers of $\frac{2}{3}$, and whose rotation number is $\sqrt{2}-1$. This is achieved by showing that a renormalization procedure becomes periodic when applied to $f$. Our construction gives a negative answer to a question of D. Calegari. When combined with work of the 2nd and 3rd authors, our result also shows that $F_{\frac{2}{3}}$ does not embed into $F$, where $F_{\frac{2}{3}}$ is the subgroup of the Stein-Thompson group $F_{2,3}$ consisting of those elements whose slopes are powers of $\frac{2}{3}$. Finally, we produce some evidence suggesting a positive answer to a variation of Calegari's question and record a number of computational observations.

Witsenhausen's problem asks for the maximum fraction $\alpha_n$ of the $n$-dimensional unit sphere that can be covered by a measurable set containing no pairs of orthogonal points. The best upper bounds for $\alpha_n$ are given by extensions of the Lovász theta number. In this paper, optimization hierarchies based on the Lovász theta number, like the Lasserre hierarchy, are extended to Witsenhausen's problem and similar problems. These hierarchies are shown to converge and are used to compute the best upper bounds for $\alpha_n$ in low dimensions.

Merging Rate of Opinions via Optimal Transport on Random Measures

Random measures provide flexible parameters for Bayesian nonparametric models. Given two different priors for a random measure, we develop a natural framework to investigate the rate at which the corresponding posteriors merge, as the sample size increases. We define a new distance between the laws of random measures that is built as a Wasserstein distance on the ground space of unbalanced measures, endowed with the bounded Lipschitz metric. We develop tight analytical bounds for its specification to completely random measures, including the special case of Poisson and gamma random measures. The bounds are interpreted in terms of an adapted extended Wasserstein distance between the Lévy measures and are used to investigate the merging between the posteriors of normalized gamma and generalized gamma priors. After a careful study on the identifiability of the law of the random measure, interesting asymptotic and finite-sample insights are derived without putting any assumption on the true data generating process.

An Inexact Proximal Linearized DC Algorithm with Provably Terminating Inner Loop

Standard approaches to difference-of-convex (DC) programs require exact solution to a convex subproblem at each iteration, which generally requires noiseless computation and infinite iterations of an inner iterative algorithm. To tackle these difficulties, inexact DC algorithms have been proposed, mostly by relaxing the convex subproblem to an approximate monotone inclusion problem. However, there is no guarantee that such relaxation can lead to a finitely terminating inner loop. In this paper, we point out the termination issue of existing inexact DC algorithms by presenting concrete counterexamples. Exploiting the notion of $\epsilon$-subdifferential, we propose a novel inexact proximal linearized DC algorithm termed tPLDCA. Despite permission to a great extent of inexactness in computation, tPLDCA enjoys the same convergence guarantees as exact DC algorithms. Most noticeably, the inner loop of tPLDCA is guaranteed to terminate in finite iterations as long as the inner iterative algorithm converges to a solution of the proximal point subproblem, which makes an essential difference from prior arts. In addition, by assuming the first convex component of the DC function to be pointwise maximum of finitely many convex smooth functions, we propose a computational friendly surrogate of $\epsilon$-subdifferential, whereby we develop a feasible implementation of tPLDCA. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed implementation of tPLDCA.

Prosaic Abelian Varieties Bad at One Prime

We say that an abelian variety $A_{/\mathbf Q}$ of dimension $g$ is {\em prosaic} if it is semistable, with good reduction at 2 and its points of order $2$ generate a $2$-extension of ${\mathbf Q}$.
For $p \equiv 1 \bmod{8}$, let $M_u$ be the maximal 2-primary unramified abelian extension of $K = {\mathbf Q}(\sqrt{-p})$ and let $h_2 =[M_u:K]$. We construct an indecomposable group scheme $\Xi_p$ over ${\mathbf Z}[\frac{1}{p}]$ of exponent 2 with field of points $M_u$.
Assume that $A$ is prosaic, with bad reduction at only one prime $p$. Then $p \equiv 1 \bmod{8}$ and $A$ is totally toroidal at $p$. We prove that if End $A={\mathbf Z}$, then there is a ${\mathbf Q}$-isogenous abelian variety $B$ such that $B[2]$ is a subquotient of $\Xi_p$. We thereby show that $2g+2 \le h_2$ and $p$ has the form $a^2+16b^2$, with $a+4b \equiv \pm 1 \bmod{8}$. Moreover, if $2g + 4 \le h_2$, then $p$ has the form $a^2+64b^2$, with $a \equiv \pm 1 \bmod{8}$.

Following Bright and Newton, we give some necessaries conditions on the ramification index that the prime ideal of the number field should satisfy in order to be involved in the Brauer--Manin obstruction to weak approximation. To support the results, many examples of transcendental Brauer--Manin obstruction to weak approximation on K3 surfaces are given.

Several new classes of MDS symbol-pair codes derived from matrix-product codes

Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT)
In order to correct the pair-errors generated during the transmission of modern high-density data storage that the outputs of the channels consist of overlapping pairs of symbols, a new coding scheme named symbol-pair code is proposed. The error-correcting capability of the symbol-pair code is determined by its minimum symbol-pair distance. For such codes, the larger the minimum symbol-pair distance, the better. It is a challenging task to construct symbol-pair codes with optimal parameters, especially, maximum-distance-separable (MDS) symbol-pair codes. In this paper, the permutation equivalence codes of matrix-product codes with underlying matrices of orders $3$ and $4$ are used to extend the minimum symbol-pair distance, four new classes of MDS symbol-pair codes and a new class of AMDS symbol-pair codes are derived.

This lets us transfer measure convergence between the two systems, allowing us to pull back results from Teichm{ü}ller dynamics to deduce analogous statements for the earthquake flow.

We study a form of dévissage for generation in derived categories of Noetherian schemes. First, we extend a result of Takahashi from the affine context to the global setting, showing that the bounded derived category is classically generated by a perfect complex together with structure sheaves of closed subschemes supported on the singular locus. Second, we make an observation for how generation behaves under the derived pushforward of a proper surjective morphism between Noetherian schemes. These results enable us to explicitly identify strong generators for projective schemes with isolated singularities and for singular varieties over a perfect field.

We use the framework of operational calculus to derive the operators associated with the spherical mean and related means of a function in $n$-dimensional space. These operators are then used to simplify the treatment and discussion of the means, i.\,e., to determine their power series expansion, to find the series solution to the corresponding inversion problem, to derive the associated differential equations that the means satisfy, or give meaning to fractional spherical means. Finally, we use the framework to derive the inversion formula of the X-ray transform in an operational manner.

Chernoff Information as a Privacy Constraint for Adversarial Classification and Membership Advantage
Ayşe Ünsal, Melek Önen
Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT)
This work inspects a privacy metric based on Chernoff information, namely Chernoff differential privacy, due to its significance in characterization of the optimal classifier's performance. Adversarial classification, as any other classification problem is built around minimization of the (average or correct detection) probability of error in deciding on either of the classes in the case of binary classification. Unlike the classical hypothesis testing problem, where the false alarm and mis-detection probabilities are handled separately resulting in an asymmetric behavior of the best error exponent, in this work, we characterize the relationship between $\varepsilon\textrm{-}$differential privacy, the best error exponent of one of the errors (when the other is fixed) and the best average error exponent. Accordingly, we re-derive Chernoff differential privacy in connection with $\varepsilon\textrm{-}$differential privacy using the Radon-Nikodym derivative, and prove its relation with Kullback-Leibler (KL) differential privacy. Subsequently, we present numerical evaluation results, which demonstrates that Chernoff information outperforms Kullback-Leibler divergence as a function of the privacy parameter $\varepsilon$ and the impact of the adversary's attack in Laplace mechanisms. Lastly, we introduce a new upper bound on adversary's membership advantage in membership inference attacks using Chernoff DP and numerically compare its performance with existing alternatives based on $(\varepsilon, \delta)\textrm{-}$differential privacy in the literature.

Subjects:

We provide an explicit computation of the cohomology groups (with untwisted coefficients) of semidirect products of the form $\mathbb{Z}^n\rtimes \mathbb{Z}/m$ with $m$ free of squares, by means of formulas that only depend on $n$, $m$ and the action of $\mathbb{Z}/m$ on $\mathbb{Z}^n$. We want to highlight the fact that we are not impossing any conditions on the $\mathbb{Z}/m$-action on $\mathbb{Z}^n$, and as far as we know our formulas are the first in the literature in this generality. This generalizes previous computations of Lück-Davis and Adem-Ge-Pan-Petrosyan. In order to show that our formulas are usable, we develop a concrete example of the form $\mathbb{Z}^5\rtimes \mathbb{Z}/6$ where its cohomology groups are described in full detail.

We study the modularity of the functions of the form $r(\tau)^ar(2\tau)^b$, where $a$ and $b$ are integers with $(a,b)\neq (0,0)$ and $r(\tau)$ is the Rogers-Ramanujan continued fraction, which may be considered as companions to the Ramanujan's function $k(\tau)=r(\tau)r(2\tau)^2$. In particular, we show that under some condition on $a$ and $b$, there are finitely many such functions generating the field of all modular functions on the congruence subgroup $\Gamma_1(10)$. Furthermore, we establish certain arithmetic properties of the function $l(\tau)=r(2\tau)/r(\tau)^2$, which can be used to evaluate these products. We employ the methods of Lee and Park, and some properties of $\eta$-quotients and generalized $\eta$-quotients to prove our results.

Conditional uncorrelation equals independence
Dawid Tarłowski
Subjects:
Statistics Theory (math.ST); Probability (math.PR)
We show that the stochastic independence of real-valued random variables is equivalent to the conditional uncorrelation, where the conditioning takes place over the Cartesian products of intervals. Next, we express the mutual independence in terms of the conditional correlation matrix. Our results extend the results of Jaworski et al. (Electron. J. Stat., 18(1), 653-673, 2024), which are based on the copula functions and assume the existence of the joint density of the variables. We relax this assumption and show that the independence characterization via conditional uncorrelation is valid in full generality - that is, for all kinds of random variables and any dependencies between them. Additionally, we analyse the assumptions under which the independence is determined by the local uncorrelation. The measure-theoretic methodology we present uses the Radon-Nikodym derivative to reduce the multidimensional characterization problem to the simple one-dimensional conditioning. To demonstrate the potential usefulness of the presented results, various numerical examples are presented.

Circuit-partition of infinite matroids
Nathan Bowler, Attila Joó
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
Komjáth, Milner, and Polat investigated when a finitary matroid admits a partition into circuits. They defined the class of ``finite matching extendable'' matroids and showed in their compactness theorem that those matroids always admit such a partition. Their proof is based on Shelah's singular compactness technique and a careful analysis of certain $\triangle$-systems.
We provide a short, simple proof of their theorem. Then we show that a finitary binary oriented matroid can be partitioned into directed circuits if and only if, in every cocircuit, the cardinality of the negative and positive edges is the same. This generalizes an earlier conjecture of Thomassen, settled affirmatively by the second author, about partitioning the edges of an infinite directed graph into directed cycles. As side results, a Laviolette theorem for finitary matroids and a Farkas lemma for finitary binary oriented matroids are proven. An example is given to show that, in contrast to finite oriented matroids, `binary' is essential in the latter result.

In this article we study generalised Dirac-Schrödinger operators in arbitrary signatures (with or without gradings), providing a general KK-theoretic framework for the study of index pairings and spectral flow. We provide a general Callias Theorem, which shows that the index (or the spectral flow, or abstractly the K-theory class) of Dirac-Schrödinger operators can be computed on a suitable compact hypersurface. Furthermore, if the zero eigenvalue is isolated in the spectrum of the Dirac operator, we relate the index (or spectral flow) of Dirac--Schrödinger operators to the index (or spectral flow) of corresponding Toeplitz operators. Combining both results, we obtain an index (or spectral flow) equality relating Toeplitz operators on the noncompact manifold to Toeplitz operators on the compact hypersurface. Our results generalise various known results from the literature, while presenting these results in a common unified framework.

Nonlinear Derivative-free Constrained Optimization with a Mixed Penalty-Logarithmic Barrier Approach and Direct Search

Comments:

Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
In this work, we propose the joint use of a mixed penalty-interior point method and direct search, for addressing nonlinearly constrained derivative-free optimization problems. A merit function is considered, wherein the set of nonlinear inequality constraints is divided into two groups: one treated with a logarithmic barrier approach, and another, along with the equality constraints, addressed using a penalization term. This strategy, is adapted and incorporated into a direct search method, enabling the effective handling of general nonlinear constraints. Convergence to KKT-stationary points is established under continuous differentiability assumptions, without requiring any kind of convexity. Using CUTEst test problems, numerical experiments demonstrate the robustness, efficiency, and overall effectiveness of the proposed method, when compared with state-of-the-art solvers.

We prove several results of this form and demonstrate that no estimate can hold before that time. As an example application, we construct solutions to graphical curve shortening flow starting with initial data that is merely an $L^1$ function.

Approximate independence of permutation mixtures

We prove bounds on statistical distances between high-dimensional exchangeable mixture distributions (which we call \emph{permutation mixtures}) and their i.i.d. counterparts. Our results are based on a novel method for controlling $\chi^2$ divergences between exchangeable mixtures, which is tighter than the existing methods of moments or cumulants. At a technical level, a key innovation in our proofs is a new Maclaurin-type inequality for elementary symmetric polynomials of variables that sum to zero and an upper bound on permanents of doubly-stochastic positive semidefinite matrices. We obtain as a corollary a new de Finetti-style theorem (in the language of Diaconis and Freedman, 1987), as well as several new statistical results, including a differential privacy guarantee for the ``shuffled privacy model'' with Gaussian noise and improved generic consistency guarantees for empirical Bayes procedures in compound decision problems.

The main purpose of this article is to establish the Runge-type approximation in $L^2(0,T;\widetilde{H}^s(\Omega))$ for solutions of linear nonlocal wave equations. To achieve this, we extend the theory of very weak solutions for classical wave equations to our nonlocal framework. This strengthened Runge approximation property allows us to extend the existing uniqueness results for Calderón problems of linear and nonlinear nonlocal wave equations in our earlier works. Furthermore, we prove unique determination results for the Calderón problem of nonlocal wave equations with polyhomogeneous nonlinearities.

Besov spaces and Schatten class Hankel operators for Hardy and Paley--Wiener spaces in higher dimensions

Comments:
This article supersedes a previous preprint of the authors. The main results now characterize the Schatten class Hankel operators on the product Hardy space as well as for the Paley Wiener space associated with any bounded strongly convex set in Rn. The results apply for all parameters of the weights, and for all p between 1 and infinity. More general results are also presented

We consider Schatten class membership of Hankel operators on Paley--Wiener spaces of convex $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, both for bounded and unbounded domains. In particular, the classical product Hardy spaces fit within our theory. For admissible domains, we develop a framework and theory of Besov spaces of Paley--Wiener type, and prove that a Hankel operator belongs to the Schatten class $S^p$ if and only if its symbol belongs to a corresponding Besov space, for $1 \leq p \leq 2$. We extend this result to all $1 \leq p < \infty$ for the classical product Hardy spaces and for the Paley--Wiener space of a bounded smooth domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ of strictly positive curvature.

Cornell University Uses Integer Programming to Optimize Final Exam Scheduling
Tinghan Ye, Adam S. Jovine, Willem van Osselaer, Qihan Zhu, David B. Shmoys
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
This paper presents an integer programming-based optimization framework designed to effectively address the complex final exam scheduling challenges encountered at Cornell University. With high flexibility, the framework is specifically tailored to accommodate a variety of different constraints, including the front-loading of large courses and the exclusion of specific time slots during the exam period. By generating multiple scheduling model variants and incorporating heuristic approaches, our framework enables comprehensive comparisons of different schedules. This empowers the University Registrar to make informed decisions, considering trade-offs in terms of schedule comfort measured by different levels of exam conflicts. Our results demonstrate significant advantage over the historical lecture time-based approach, providing time and effort savings for the university administration while enhancing student and faculty satisfaction.

The Immersed Skeletal Finite Element Method for Elliptic Interface Problems
Lin Yang, Qilong Zhai
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
In this paper, we present a new immersed finite element scheme for solving elliptic interface problems on unfitted meshes by combining the skeletal finite element method (FEM) with the standard FEM. The skeletal FEM is used for the interface elements. In other words, we take piecewise functions as the unknowns inside the interface element and on its boundary. We employ the immersed finite element functions as interior functions that precisely satisfy the interface conditions. On the interface edges, we define two boundary functions to capture the discontinuity. The Lagrange element is used for the non-interface elements. The proposed scheme is simple and flexible. We prove that this scheme achieves optimal convergence orders in both the $H^1$ norm and $L^2$ norm. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method.

Cusp types of arithmetic hyperbolic manifolds

Comments:

Subjects:
Geometric Topology (math.GT)
We establish necessary and sufficient conditions for determining when a flat manifold can occur as a cusp cross-section within a given commensurability class of cusped arithmetic hyperbolic manifolds. This reduces the problem of identifying which commensurability classes of arithmetic hyperbolic manifolds can contain a specific flat manifold as a cusp cross-section to a question involving rational representations of the flat manifold's holonomy group. More generally we show that the holonomy representation provides an obstruction on the quasi-arithmetic manifolds containing a given flat manifold as a cusp cross-section. As applications, we prove that a flat manifold $M$ with a holonomy group of odd order appears as a cusp cross-section in every commensurability class of arithmetic hyperbolic manifolds if and only if $b_1(M)\geq 3$. We also provide examples of flat manifolds that arise as cusp cross-sections in a unique commensurability class of arithmetic hyperbolic manifolds and exhibit examples of pairs of flat manifolds that can never appear as cusp cross-sections in the same quasi-arithmetic hyperbolic manifold.

The Ground State of a Cubic-quintic Nonlinear Schrödinger Equation with Radial Potential in the Thomas-Fermi Limit
Deke Li, Qingxuan Wang
Comments:

Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
We focus on the ground state of the cubic-quintic nonlinear Schrödinger energy functional \begin{gather*}
\begin{aligned}
{E}(\varphi)=\frac{1}{2}\int_{\mathbb{R}^d}\left(|\nabla \varphi|^2+V(x)|\varphi|^2\right)\,dx
\pm\frac{1}{4}\int_{\mathbb{R}^d}|\varphi|^4\,dx
+\frac{1}{6}\int_{\mathbb{R}^d}|\varphi|^6\,dx, (d=1,2,3)
\end{aligned} \end{gather*}
under the mass constraint $\int_{\mathbb{R}^d}|\varphi|^2\,dx=N$, where $N$ can be viewed as particle number, and $V(x)$ behaves like $C|x|^p (p\geq 2)$ as $|x|\rightarrow +\infty$, including the harmonic potential. When $N\rightarrow +\infty$, we show that up to a suitable scaling the ground state $\varphi_N$ would convergence strongly in some $L^q(\mathbb{R}^d)$ space to a Thomas-Fermi minimizer, this limit can be referred to as the \emph{Thomas-Fermi limit}. The limit Thomas-Fermi profile has compact support, given by $u^{TF}(x)=\left[\mu^{TF}-C_0|x|^p\right]^{\frac{1}{4}}_{+}$, where $\mu^{TF}$ is a suitable Lagrange multiplier with exact value. We find that, similar to the asymptotic analysis in [J. Funct. Anal. 260 (2011), 2387-2406.] and [Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal. 217 (2015), 439-523.] for Gross-Pitaevskii energy in the Thomas-Fermi limit where a small parameter $\varepsilon$ tends to 0, there also has a steep \emph{corner layer} near the boundary of compact support of $u^{TF}(x)$, in which the ground state has irregular behavior as $N\rightarrow +\infty$. Finally, we establish a new energy method to obtain the $L^\infty$-convergence rates of ground states $\varphi_N$ inside the corner layer and outside corner layer respectively, this method may be applicable to other general nonlinearities.

The category $\bcalNT$ was introduced in \cite{Lobos2} in order to provide a structural setting to the study of the many Gelfand-Tsetlin subalgebras appearing in the context of the diagrammatic Soergel category of Elias and Williamson \cite{EW}. The category $\bcalNT$ have as objects, all that we called \emph{nil graded algebras associated to a triangular matrix} and as morphisms, all the \emph{preserving degree} homomorphisms of graded algebras between them. In this article we develop a series of \emph{isomorphism criteria} on $\bcalNT$ that we used later to find out relevant information on the Gelfand-Tsetlin subalgebras of the diagrammatic Soergel category.

The robust isolated calmness of spectral norm regularized convex matrix optimization problems
Ziran Yin, Xiaoyu Chen, Jihong Zhang
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
This paper aims to provide a series of characterizations of the robust isolated calmness of the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) mapping for spectral norm regularized convex optimization problems. By establishing the variational properties of the spectral norm function, we directly prove that the KKT mapping is isolated calm if and only if the strict Robinson constraint qualification (SRCQ) and the second order sufficient condition (SOSC) hold. Furthermore, we obtain the crucial result that the SRCQ for the primal problem and the SOSC for the dual problem are equivalent. The obtained results can derive more equivalent or sufficient conditions of the robust isolated calmness of the KKT mapping, thereby enriching the stability theory of spectral norm regularized optimization problems and enhancing the usability of isolated calmness in algorithm applications.

Topological vortex identification for two-dimensional turbulent flows in doubly periodic domains

The dynamics and statistical properties of two-dimensional (2D) turbulence are often investigated through numerical simulations of incompressible, viscous fluids in doubly periodic domains. A key challenge in 2D turbulence research is accurately identifying and describing statistical properties of its coherent vortex structures within complex flow patterns. This paper addresses this challenge by providing a classification theory for the topological structure of particle orbits generated by instantaneous Hamiltonian flows on the torus $\mathbb{T}^2$, which serves as a mathematical model for 2D incompressible flows. Based on this theory, we show that the global orbit structure of any Hamiltonian flow can be converted into a planar tree, named a partially Cyclically-Ordered rooted Tree (COT), and its corresponding string expression (COT representation). We apply this conversion algorithm to 2D energy and enstrophy cascade turbulence. The results show that the complex topological structure of turbulent flow patterns can be effectively represented by simple trees and sequences of letters, thereby successfully extracting coherent vortex structures and investigating their statistical properties from a topological perspective.

Large cardinals, structural reflection, and the HOD Conjecture
Juan P. Aguilera, Joan Bagaria, Philipp Lücke
Comments:
42 pages. Updated version
Subjects:
Logic (math.LO)
We introduce exacting cardinals and a strengthening of these, ultraexacting cardinals. These are natural large cardinals defined equivalently as weak forms of rank-Berkeley cardinals, strong forms of Jónsson cardinals, or in terms of principles of structural reflection. However, they challenge commonly held intuition on strong axioms of infinity. We prove that ultraexacting cardinals are consistent with Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory with the Axiom of Choice (ZFC) relative to the existence of an I0 embedding. However, the existence of an ultraexacting cardinal below a measurable cardinal implies the consistency of ZFC with a proper class of I0 embeddings, thus challenging the linear--incremental picture of the large cardinal hierarchy. We show that the existence of an exacting cardinal implies that V is not equal to HOD (Gödel's universe of Hereditarily Ordinal Definable sets), showing that these cardinals surpass the current hierarchy of large cardinals consistent with ZFC. Moreover, we prove that the existence of an exacting cardinal above an extendible cardinal implies the "V is far from HOD" alternative of Woodin's HOD Dichotomy. In particular, it follows that the consistency of ZFC with an exacting cardinal above an extendible cardinal would refute Woodin's HOD Conjecture and Ultimate-L Conjecture. Finally, we show that the consistency of ZF with certain large cardinals beyond choice implies the consistency of ZFC with the existence of an exacting cardinal above an extendible cardinal.

Equitable coloring of sparse graphs

Comments:

Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO); Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM)
An equitable coloring of a graph is a proper coloring where the sizes of any two distinct color classes differ by at most one. The celebrated Chen-Lih-Wu Conjecture (CLWC for short) states that every connected graph $G$ that is neither an odd cycle, a $K_r$, nor a $K_{2m+1,2m+1}$ has an equitable $\Delta(G)$-coloring. A graph $G$ is in $\mathcal{G}_{m_1,m_2}$ if for all $H\subseteq G$, $\lVert H \rVert\leq m_1|H|$, and if $H$ is bipartite, then $\lVert H \rVert\leq m_2|H|$. In this paper, we confirm CLWC for all graphs $G$ in $\mathcal{G}_{m_1, m_2}$ provided that $m_1\leq 1.8m_2$ and $\Delta(G)\geq \frac{2m_1}{1-\beta}$, where $\beta$ is a real root of $2m_2(1-x)(1+x)^2-m_1x(2+x)$. By specializing to the case $m_1 = m_2 = d$, we deduce that every $d$-degenerate graph $G$ with $\Delta(G) \geq 6.21d$ admits an equitable $r$-coloring for all $r \geq \Delta(G)$, thereby improving the previous best-known lower bound of $10d$ on $\Delta(G)$ established by Kostochka and Nakprasit in 2005. A graph is $k$-planar if it can be drawn in the plane so that each edge is crossed at most $k$ times. CLWC had been confirmed for planar graphs $G$ with $\Delta(G) \geq 8$ (Kostochka, Lin, and Xiang, 2024) and for $1$-planar graphs $G$ with $\Delta(G) \geq 13$ (Cranston and Mahmoud, 2025). As an immediate application of our main result, we extend this confirmation to all $k$-planar graphs $G$ with $k \geq 2$ and $\Delta(G) \geq \sqrt{383k}$.

Online Allocation of Throughput-Constrained Resources Using Proxy Assignments
Chamsi Hssaine, Huseyin Topaloglu, Garrett van Ryzin
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
We study a variation of the canonical online resource allocation problem in which resources are throughput, rather than budget, constrained. As in the classical setting, the decision-maker must assign sequentially arriving jobs to one of multiple available resources. However, in addition to the assignment costs incurred from these decisions, the decision-maker is also penalized for deviating from exogenous, time-varying target assignment rates for each resource, which represent the resources' respective throughput capacities throughout the horizon. The goal is to minimize the total expected assignment and deviation penalty costs incurred throughout the horizon when the distribution of assignment costs is unknown. We first show that naive extensions of state-of-the-art algorithms for classical budget-constrained resource allocation problems can fail dramatically when applied to throughput-constrained resource allocation. We then propose a novel ``proxy assignment" primal-dual algorithm that uses current arrivals to simulate the effect of future arrivals. We prove that our algorithm achieves the optimal $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound when the assignment costs of the arriving jobs are drawn i.i.d. from a fixed distribution. We demonstrate the practical performance of our approach by conducting numerical experiments on synthetic datasets, as well as real-world datasets from retail fulfillment operations.

A locally-conservative proximal Galerkin method for pointwise bound constraints
Guosheng Fu, Brendan Keith, Rami Masri
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
We introduce the first-order system proximal Galerkin (FOSPG) method, a locally mass-conserving, hybridizable finite element method for solving heterogeneous anisotropic diffusion and obstacle problems. Like other proximal Galerkin methods, FOSPG finds solutions by solving a recursive sequence of smooth, discretized, nonlinear subproblems. We establish the well-posedness and convergence of these nonlinear subproblems along with stability and error estimates under low regularity assumptions for the linearized equations obtained by solving each subproblem using Newton's method. The FOSPG method exhibits several advantages, including high-order accuracy, discrete maximum principle or bound-preserving discrete solutions, and local mass conservation. It also achieves prescribed solution accuracy within asymptotically mesh-independent numbers of subproblems and linear solves per subproblem iteration. Numerical experiments on benchmarks for anisotropic diffusion and obstacle problems confirm these attributes. Furthermore, an open-source implementation of the method is provided to facilitate broader adoption and reproducibility.

Well-posedness of quadratic RBSDEs and BSDEs with one-sided growth restrictions
Shiqiu Zheng
Comments:

Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
In this paper, we investigate the well-posedness of bounded and unbounded solutions for reflected backward stochastic differential equations (RBSDEs) and backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs). The generators of these equations satisfy a one-sided growth restriction on the variable $y$ and have a general quadratic growth in the variable $z$. The solutions $Y_t$ (and the obstacles of RBSDEs) take values in either $\mathbf{R}$ or $(0, \infty)$. We obtain the existence of solutions primarily by using the methods from Essaky and Hassani (2011) and Bahlali et al. (2017). For the uniqueness of solutions, we provide a method applicable when the generators are convex in $(y,z)$ or are (locally) Lipschitz in $y$ and convex in $z$. Our method relies on the $\theta$-difference technique introduced by Briand and Hu (2008), and some innovative comparison arguments based on RBSDEs. We also establish some general comparison theorems for such RBSDEs and BSDEs.

A Stable Measure for Conditional Periodicity of Time Series using Persistent Homology
Bala Krishnamoorthy, Elizabeth P. Thompson
Subjects:
Algebraic Topology (math.AT); Statistics Theory (math.ST); Machine Learning (stat.ML)
Given a pair of time series, we study how the periodicity of one influences the periodicity of the other. There are several known methods to measure the similarity between a pair of time series, but we have yet to find any measures with theoretical stability results. Persistence homology has been utilized to construct a scoring function with theoretical guarantees of stability that quantifies the periodicity of a single univariate time series f1, denoted score(f1). Building on this concept, we propose a conditional periodicity score that quantifies the periodicity similarity of two univariate time series, denoted score(f1|f2), and derive theoretical stability results for the same. We prove stability of score(f1|f2) under orthogonal projection of the time series embeddings onto their first K principal components. We show that the change in our score is bounded by a function of the eigenvalues corresponding to the remaining (unused) N-K principal components and hence is small when the first K principal components capture most of the variation in the time series embeddings. We derive a lower bound on the embedding dimension to use in our pipeline which guarantees that any two such embeddings produce scores that are linearly within epsilon of each other. We present a procedure for computing conditional periodicity scores and implement it on several types of synthetic signals. We experimentally compare our similarity measure to the most-similar statistical measure of percent determinism (%DET) and show greater stability of score(f1|f2). We also compare both measures on several pairs of real time series describing monthly proportions of incoming calls to a police agency and highlight the decreased stability of %DET on the same.

Given an open subset $U$ of a complex Banach space $E$, a weight $v$ on $U$, and a complex Banach space $F$, let $\Hv(U,F)$ denote the Banach space of all weighted holomorphic mappings $f\colon U\to F$, under the weighted supremum norm $\left\|f\right\|_v:=\sup\left\{v(x)\left\|f(x)\right\|\colon x\in U\right\}$. In this paper, we introduce and study the class $\Pi_p^{\Hv}(U,F)$ of $p$-summing weighted holomorphic mappings. We prove that it is an injective Banach ideal of weighted holomorphic mappings. Variants for weighted holomorphic mappings of Pietsch Domination Theorem, Pietsch Factorization Theorem and Maurey Extrapolation Theorem are presented. We also identify the spaces of $p$-summing weighted holomorphic mappings from $U$ into $F^*$ under the norm $\pi^{\Hv}_p$ with the duals of $F$-valued $\Hv$-molecules on $U$ under a suitable version $d^{\Hv}_{p^*}$ of the Chevet--Saphar tensor norms.

We define special objects, Ulrich objects, on a derived category of polarized smooth projective variety as a generalization of Ulrich bundles to the derived category. These are defined by the cohomological conditions that are the same form as a cohomological criterion determining Ulrichness for sheaves. This paper gives a characterization of the Ulrich object similar to the one in [ES03]. As an application, we have provided a new approach to the Eisenbud-Schreyer question by using the notions of the generator of the derived category. We also have given an example of Ulrich objects that are not sheaf by Yoneda extensions.

A Closed-Form Transition Density Expansion for Elliptic and Hypo-Elliptic SDEs
Yuga Iguchi, Alexandros Beskos
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA); Statistics Theory (math.ST)
We introduce a closed-form expansion for the transition density of elliptic and hypo-elliptic multivariate Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs), over a period $\Delta\in (0,1)$, in terms of powers of $\Delta^{j/2}$, $j\ge 0$. Our methodology provides approximations of the transition density, easily evaluated via any software that performs symbolic calculations. A major part of the paper is devoted to an analytical control of the remainder in our expansion for fixed $\Delta\in(0,1)$. The obtained error bounds validate theoretically the methodology, by characterising the size of the distance from the true value. It is the first time that such a closed-form expansion becomes available for the important class of hypo-elliptic SDEs, to the best of our knowledge. For elliptic SDEs, closed-form expansions are available, with some works identifying the size of the error for fixed $\Delta$, as per our contribution. Our methodology allows for a uniform treatment of elliptic and hypo-elliptic SDEs, when earlier works are intrinsically restricted to an elliptic setting. We show numerical applications highlighting the effectiveness of our method, by carrying out parameter inference for hypo-elliptic SDEs that do not satisfy stated conditions. The latter are sufficient for controlling the remainder terms, but the closed-form expansion itself is applicable in general settings.

This paper provides an iterative procedure for constructing hyperbolic Coxeter groups that virtually fiber over $\mathbb{Z}$ that is flexible enough to yield infinitely many isomorphism classes in each virtual cohomological dimension (vcd) $n\geq 2$. Our procedure combines results of Jankiewicz, Norin, and Wise with a generalization of a construction due to Osajda involving a new simplicial thickening process. We also give a topological argument showing that the vcd of the right-angled Coxeter groups produced by our construction increases by exactly one with each iteration, guaranteeing that our process produces examples of every vcd.

Subjects:

By revisiting the end-cut preference (ECP) phenomenon associated with a single CART (Breiman et al. (1984)), we introduce MinimaxSplit decision trees, a robust alternative to CART that selects splits by minimizing the worst-case child risk rather than the average risk. For regression, we minimize the maximum within-child squared error; for classification, we minimize the maximum child entropy, yielding a C4.5-compatible criterion. We also study a cyclic variant that deterministically cycles coordinates, leading to our main method of cyclic MinimaxSplit decision trees. We prove oracle inequalities that cover both regression and classification, under mild marginal non-atomicity conditions. The bounds control the tree's global excess risk by local worst-case impurities and yield fast convergence rates compared to CART. We extend the analysis to ensembles that subsample coordinates per node. Empirically, (cyclic) MinimaxSplit trees and their forests improve on structured heterogeneity data such as EEG amplitude regression over fixed time horizons, seasonal air quality forecasting, and image denoising framed as non-parametric regression on spatial coordinates.

Our results extend previous analyses-which were limited to reversible cases-to the nonreversible setting. To facilitate this generalization, we introduce novel concepts, termed the back-and-forth path and the pivot node, which serve as effective alternatives to traditional techniques that require reversibility. Moreover, we apply our approach to Cayley graphs and random geometric graphs to estimate the LQ cost without the reversibility assumption. The proposed approach provides a framework that can be adapted to other contexts where reversibility is typically assumed.

Title:
The dimension and Bose distance of certain primitive BCH codes
Run Zheng, Nung-Sing Sze, Zejun Huang
Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT)
BCH codes are a significant class of cyclic codes that play an important role in both theoretical research and practical applications. Their strong error-correcting abilities and efficient encoding and decoding methods make BCH codes widely applicable in various areas, including communication systems, data storage devices, and consumer electronics. Although BCH codes have been extensively studied, the parameters of BCH codes are not known in general.
Let $q$ be a prime power and $m$ be a positive integer. Denote by $\mathcal{C}_{\left(q,m,\delta)\right)}$ the narrow-sense primitive BCH code with length $q^m-1$ and designed distance $\delta$. As of now, the dimensions of
$\mathcal{C}_{(q,m,\delta)}$ are fully understood only for $m \leq 2$. For $m \geq 4$, the dimensions of $\mathcal{C}_{(q,m,\delta)}$ are known only for
the range $2 \leq \delta \leq q^{\lfloor (m+1)/2 \rfloor +1}$ and for a limited number of special cases. In this paper, we determined the dimension and Bose distance of $\mathcal{C}_{(q,m,\delta)}$ for $m\geq 4$ and
$\delta\in [2, q^{\lfloor ( 2m-1)/{3}\rfloor+1}]. $ Additionally, we have also extended our results to some primitive BCH codes that are not necessarily narrow-sense.

Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
We present a structure-preserving and thermodynamically consistent numerical scheme for classical magnetohydrodynamics, incorporating viscosity, magnetic resistivity, heat transfer, and thermoelectric effect. The governing equations are shown to be derived from a generalized Hamilton's principle, with the resulting weak formulation being mimicked at the discrete level. The resulting numerical method conserves mass and energy, satisfies Gauss' magnetic law and magnetic helicity balance, and adheres to the Second Law of Thermodynamics, all at the fully discrete level. It is shown to perform well on magnetic Rayleigh-Bénard convection.

On arborealization, Maslov data, and lack thereof
Daniel Alvarez-Gavela, Tim Large, Abigail Ward
Comments:
v2:a few typos and minor errors fixed
Subjects:
Symplectic Geometry (math.SG); Algebraic Topology (math.AT)
For a Weinstein manifold, we compare and contrast the properties of admitting an arboreal skeleton and admitting Maslov data. Both properties are implied by the existence of a polarization, for which a basic obstruction is that the odd Chern classes are 2-torsion. In a similar spirit we establish cohomological obstructions to the existence of arboreal skeleta and to the existence of Maslov data, exhibiting concrete examples to illustrate their failure. For instance, we show that complements of smooth anti-canonical divisors in complex projective space may fail to admit either arboreal skeleta or Maslov data. We also exhibit an example of a Weinstein manifold which admits Maslov data but does not admit an arboreal skeleton.

Geometric realizations of $ν$-associahedra via brick polyhedra

Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
Brick polytopes constitute a remarkable family of polytopes associated to the spherical subword complexes of Knutson and Miller. They were introduced for finite Coxeter groups by Pilaud and Stump, who used them to produce geometric realizations of generalized associahedra arising from the theory of cluster algebras of finite types. In this paper, we present an application of the vast generalization of brick polyhedra for general subword complexes (not necessarily spherical) recently introduced by Jahn and Stump.
More precisely, we show that the $\nu$-associahedron, a polytopal complex whose edge graph is the Hasse diagram of the $\nu$-Tamari lattice introduced by Préville-Ratelle and Viennot, can be geometrically realized as the complex of bounded faces of the brick polyhedron of a well chosen subword complex. We also present a suitable projection to the appropriate dimension, which leads to an elegant vertex-coordinate description.

Does $14$ have a friend? Until now, this has been an open question. In this note, we prove that a potential friend $F$ of $14$ is an odd, non-square positive integer. $7$ appears in the prime factorization of $F$ with an even exponent while at most two prime divisors of $F$ can have odd exponents in the prime factorization of $F$. If $p\mid F$ such that $p$ is congruent to $7$ modulo $8$, then $p^{2a}\mid\mid F$, for some positive integer $a$. Further, no prime divisor of $F$ has an exponent congruent to $7$ modulo $8$ and no prime divisor can exceed $1.4\sqrt{F}$. The primes $3,5$ cannot appear simultaneously in the prime factorization of $F$. If $(3,F)>1$ or $(5,F)>1$, then $\omega(F)\geq4$, otherwise $\omega(F)\geq8$.

Two Innovations in Inexact Augmented Lagrangian Methods for Convex Optimization
Jonathan Eckstein, Chang Yu
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
This paper presents two new techniques relating to inexact solution of subproblems in augmented Lagrangian methods for convex programming. The first involves combining a relative error criterion for solution of the subproblems with over- or under-relaxation of the multiplier update step. This analysis enables a new kind of inexact augmented Lagrangian method that adapts the amount of multiplier step relaxation to the accuracy of the subproblem, subject to a viability test employing the discriminant of a certain quadratic function. The second innovation involves solution of augmented Lagrangian subproblems for problems posed in standard Fenchel-Rockafellar form. We show that applying alternating minimization to this subproblem, as in the first two steps of the ADMM, is equivalent to executing the classical proximal gradient method on a dual formulation of the subproblem. By substituting more sophisticated variants of the proximal gradient method for the classical one, it is possible to construct new ADMM-like methods with better empirical performance than using ordinary alternating minimization within an inexact augmented Lagrangian framework. The paper concludes by describing some computational experiments exploring using these two innovations, both separately and jointly, to solve LASSO problems.

On walk domination: Between different types of walks and $m_3$-path
Hangdi Chen, Yuhan Ma, Qingjie Ye
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
Given two non-adjacent vertices \( u \) and \( v \), we say a $uv$-walk \( W \) dominates a $uv$-walk \( W' \) if every internal vertex of \( W' \) is adjacent to some internal vertex of \( W \) or belongs to \( W \). A class of walks \(\mathbf{A}\) dominates a class of walks \(\mathbf{B}\) if for every pair of non-adjacent vertices $u,v$ in the graph, every $uv$-walk in \(\mathbf{A}\) dominates every $uv$-walk in \(\mathbf{B}\). This paper investigates the domination relationships among various types of walks connecting two non-adjacent vertices in a graph. In particular, we focus on the problem which is proposed in [S. B. Tondato, Graphs Combin. 40 (2024)]. We study the domination between different walk types (shortest paths, toll walks, weakly toll walks, $l_k$-paths for $k\in \left\{2,3\right\}$) and $m_3$-paths. And we show how these relationships give rise to characterizations of graph classes.

Uniqueness in determining multidimensional domains with unknown initial data

Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
This paper addresses several geometric inverse problems for some linear parabolic systems where the initial data (and sometimes also the coefficients of the equations) are unknown.
The goal is to identify a subdomain within a multidimensional set.
The non-homogeneous part of the equation is expressed as a function satisfying some specific assumptions near a positive time.
We establish uniqueness results by incorporating observations that can be on a part of the boundary or in an interior (small) domain.
Through this process, we also derive information about the initial data.
The main tools required for the proofs include semigroup theory, unique continuation and time analyticity results

Improved Decoding Algorithm of BD-LRPC Codes
Hermann Tchatchiem Kamche
Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT)
A Bounded-Degree Low-Rank Parity-Check (BD-LRPC) code is a rank-metric code that admits a parity-check matrix whose support is generated by a set of powers of an element. This specific structure of the parity-check matrix was employed to enhance the first phase of the decoding algorithm through the expansion of the syndrome support. However, this expansion decreases the probability of recovering the error support in the second phase of the decoding algorithm. This paper introduces a novel method based on successive intersections to recover the error support. This method offers two key advantages: it increases the probability of successful decoding and enables the decoding of a greater number of errors.

A constructive approach to strengthen algebraic descriptions of function and operator classes
Anne Rubbens, Julien M. Hendrickx, Adrien Taylor
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
It is well known that functions (resp. operators) satisfying a property~$p$ on a subset $Q\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ cannot necessarily be extended to a function (resp. operator) satisfying~$p$ on the whole of~$\mathbb{R}^d$. Given $Q \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$, this work considers the problem of obtaining necessary and ideally sufficient conditions to be satisfied by a function (resp. operator) on $Q$, ensuring the existence of an extension of this function (resp. operator) satisfying $p$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$.
More precisely, given some property $p$, we present a refinement procedure to obtain stronger necessary conditions to be imposed on $Q$. This procedure can be applied iteratively until the stronger conditions are also sufficient. We illustrate the procedure on a few examples, including the strengthening of existing descriptions for the classes of smooth functions satisfying a Łojasiewicz condition, convex blockwise smooth functions, Lipschitz monotone operators, strongly monotone cocoercive operators, and uniformly convex functions.
In most cases, these strengthened descriptions can be represented, or relaxed, to semi-definite constraints, which can be used to formulate tractable optimization problems on functions (resp. operators) within those classes.

Subjects:

This paper extends sliding-mode control theory to nonlinear systems evolving on smooth manifolds. Building on differential geometric methods, we reformulate Filippov's notion of solutions, characterize well-defined vector fields on quotient spaces, and provide a consistent geometric definition of higher-order sliding modes. We generalize the regular form to non-Euclidean settings and design explicit first- and second-order sliding-mode controllers that respect the manifold structure. Particular attention is given to the role of topological obstructions, which are illustrated through examples on the cylinder, Möbius bundle, and 2-sphere. Our results highlight how geometric and topological properties fundamentally influence sliding dynamics and suggest new directions for robust control in nonlinear spaces.

Algebraic structures arising from the finite condensation on linear orders
Jennifer Brown, Ricardo Suárez
Comments:
terminology corrected -- left regular (not rectangular) band
Subjects:
Logic (math.LO)
The finite condensation $\sim_F$ is an equivalence relation defined on a linear order $L$ by $x \sim_F y$ if and only if the set of points lying between $x$ and $y$ is finite. We define an operation $\cdot_F$ on linear orders $L$ and $M$ by $L \cdot_F M = \operatorname{o.t.}\left((LM)/\!\sim_F\right)$; that is, $L \cdot_F M$ is the order type of the lexicographic product of $L$ and $M$ modulo the finite condensation. The infinite order types $L$ such that $L / \! \sim_F\, \cong 1$ are $\omega, \omega^*,$ and $\zeta$ (where $\omega^*$ is the reverse ordering of $\omega$, and $\zeta$ is the order type of $\mathbb{Z}$). We show that under the operation $\cdot_F$, the set $R=\{1, \omega, \omega^*, \zeta\}$ forms a left regular band. Further, each of the ordinal elements of $R$ defines, via left or right multiplication modulo the finite condensation, a weakly order-preserving map on the class of ordinals. We study these maps' effect on the ordinals of finite degree in Cantor normal form. In particular, we examine the extent to which one of these maps, sending $\alpha$ to the order type of $\alpha$ modulo the finite condensation, behaves similarly to a derivative operator on the ordinals of finite degree in Cantor normal form.

Chordality and Shellability of Higher Independence Complexes

Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO); Commutative Algebra (math.AC)
This paper investigates the $r$-independence complex $\mathcal{I}_r(G)$ and its associated hypergraph $\mathcal{C}_r(G)$ from combinatorial and algebraic perspectives. We demonstrate that contrary to previous claims, $\mathcal{C}_r(G)$ need not be chordal even when $G$ is a tree, providing explicit counterexamples. Our results establish precise conditions for chordality across several graph classes: for cycles $C_n$, $\mathcal{C}_r(G)$ is chordal exactly when $n-2 \leq r \leq n-1$; for forests, chordality holds when $r \geq n-5$; and for block graphs, $\mathcal{C}_2(G)$ is always chordal. Furthermore, we show that $\mathcal{C}_r(G)$ remains chordal for all $r \geq 2$ in graphs with diameter constraints. The shellability of $\mathcal{I}_r(G)$ is proved through three fundamental constructions: star-clique attachments to vertex covers, generalized whiskering operations that preserve shellability under size constraints, and cyclic clique arrangements where shellability depends critically on attachment sizes. These results collectively generalize existing work on shellable independence complexes to the broader setting of higher independence complexes, revealing new connections between graph structure, hypergraph chordality, and algebraic properties of associated ideals.

Complete quasimaps to $\mathsf{Bl}_{\mathbb{P}^s}(\mathbb{P}^r)$

Comments:
Comments welcome
Subjects:
Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)
We introduce a moduli space of ``complete quasimaps'' to $\mathsf{Bl}_{\mathbb{P}^s}(\mathbb{P}^r)$. The construction, following previous work for curves on projective spaces, essentially proceeds by blowing up Ciocan-Fontanine--Kim's space of quasimaps at loci where sections of line bundles are linearly dependent. We conjecture that tautological intersection numbers on these moduli spaces give enumerative counts of curves of fixed complex structure on $X$ subject to general incidence conditions, in contrast with traditional compactifications of the moduli spaces of maps. A result of Farkas guarantees that these spaces are pure of expected dimension. The conjecture is proven in dimension 2, where the main input is a Brill-Noether theorem for general curves on toric surfaces.

The study of sums of finite sets of integers has mostly concentrated on sets with small sumsets (Freiman's theorem and related work) and on sets with large sumsets (Sidon sets and $B_h$-sets). This paper considers the sets ${\mathcal R}_{\mathbf Z}(h,k)$ and ${\mathcal R}_{{\mathbf Z}^n}(h,k)$ of \emph{all} sizes of $h$-fold sums of sets of $k$ integers or of $k$ lattice points, and the geometric and computational complexity of the sets ${\mathcal R}_{\mathbf Z}(h,k)$ and ${\mathcal R}_{{\mathbf Z}^n}(h,k)$. For sumsets $hA$ with large diameter, there is a compression algorithm to construct sets $A'$ with $|hA'| = |hA|$ and small diameter.

We show that the Word Problem in finitely generated subgroups of $\textsf{GL}_d(\mathbb{Z})$ can be solved in linear average-case complexity. This is done under the bit-complexity model, which accounts for the fact that large integers are handled, and under the assumption that the input words are chosen uniformly at random among the words of a given length. Our result generalizes to matrices in $\textsf{GL}_d(R)$, where $R$ is a subring of $\mathbb{C}$, of finite rank over $\mathbb{Z}$.

The notion of weak tiling played a key role in the proof of Fuglede's spectral set conjecture for convex domains, due to the fact that every spectral set must weakly tile its complement. In this paper, we revisit the notion of weak tiling and establish some geometric properties of sets that weakly tile their complement. If $A \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ is a convex polytope, we give a direct and self-contained proof that $A$ must be symmetric and have symmetric facets. If $A \subset \mathbb{R}$ is a finite union of intervals, we give a necessary condition on the lengths of the gaps between the intervals.

Optimal Sets and Quantization Errors under Geometric Constraints for Discrete Distributions

Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
This paper presents a detailed study of constrained quantization for both finite and infinite discrete probability distributions supported on subsets of the real line. Under specific geometric constraints - namely, a semicircular arc and the union of two sides of an equilateral triangle - we compute constrained optimal sets of $n$-points and the corresponding $n$th constrained quantization errors. For finite discrete distributions, we consider both uniform and nonuniform cases with support on $\{-3, -2, \dots, 3\}$. For infinite discrete distributions, two cases are analyzed: one supported on $\left\{ \frac{1}{n} : n \in \mathbb{N} \right\}$ and the other on the set of natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$. Explicit constructions and numerical computations of optimal quantizers and errors are provided. Furthermore, for the infinite discrete distribution supported on $\mathbb{N}$, we develop a general framework for constrained quantization under the linear constraint $y = mx + c$ and prove that the constrained quantization dimension in this setting is zero. Our results highlight how geometric constraints influence the structure and existence of optimal quantizers and pave the way for further investigations into constrained quantization theory.

Stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs), which integrate multiple programmable metasurface layers, have recently emerged as a promising technology for advanced wave-domain signal processing. SIMs benefit from flexible spatial degree-of-freedom (DoF) while reducing the requirement for costly radio-frequency (RF) chains. However, current state-of-the-art SIM designs face challenges such as complex phase shift optimization and energy attenuation from multiple layers. To address these aspects, we propose incorporating meta-fibers into SIMs, with the aim of reducing the number of layers and enhancing the energy efficiency. First, we introduce a meta-fiber-connected 2-layer SIM that exhibits the same flexible signal processing capabilities as conventional multi-layer structures, and explains the operating principle. Subsequently, we formulate and solve the optimization problem of minimizing the mean square error (MSE) between the SIM channel and the desired channel matrices. Specifically, by designing the phase shifts of the meta-atoms associated with the transmitting-SIM and receiving-SIM, a non-interference system with parallel subchannels is established. In order to reduce the computational complexity, a closed-form expression for each phase shift at each iteration of an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is proposed. We show that the proposed algorithm is applicable to conventional multi-layer SIMs. The channel capacity bound and computational complexity are analyzed to provide design insights. Finally, numerical results are illustrated, demonstrating that the proposed two-layer SIM with meta-fiber achieves over a 25% improvement in channel capacity while reducing the total number of meta-atoms by 59% as compared with a conventional seven-layer SIM.

We consider the construction of quantum-integrable spin chains with q-deformed long-range interactions by `freezing' integrable quantum many-body systems with spins. The input is a (quantum) spin-Ruijsenaars system along with an equilibrium configuration of the underlying spinless classical Ruijsenaars-Schneider system. For a distinguished choice of equilibrium, the resulting long-range spin chain has a real spectrum and admits a short-range limit, providing an integrable interpolation from nearest-neighbour to long-range interacting spins. We focus on the elliptic case. We first define an action of the modular group on the spinless elliptic Ruijsenaars-Schneider system to show that, for a fixed elliptic parameter, it has a whole modular family of classical equilibrium configurations. These typically have constant but nonzero momenta. Then we use the setting of deformation quantisation to provide a uniform framework for freezing elliptic spin-Ruijsenaars systems at any classical equilibrium whilst preserving quantum integrability. As we showed in previous work, the results include the Heisenberg, Inozemtsev and Haldane-Shastry chains along with their xxz-like q-deformations (face-type), or the antiperiodic Haldane-Shastry chain of Fukui-Kawakami, its elliptic generalisation of Sechin-Zotov, and their completely anisotropic q-deformations due to Matushko-Zotov (vertex type). Finally, we show how freezing fits in the setting of 'hybrid' integrable systems.

Pass-efficient Randomized Algorithms for Low-rank Approximation of Quaternion Matrices

Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
Randomized algorithms for low-rank approximation of quaternion matrices have gained increasing attention in recent years. However, existing methods overlook pass efficiency, the ability to limit the number of passes over the input matrix-which is critical in modern computing environments dominated by communication costs. We address this gap by proposing a suite of pass-efficient randomized algorithms that let users directly trade pass budget for approximation accuracy. Our contributions include: (i) a family of arbitrary-pass randomized algorithms for low-rank approximation of quaternion matrices that operate under a user-specified number of matrix views, and (ii) a pass-efficient extension of block Krylov subspace methods that accelerates convergence for matrices with slowly decaying spectra. Furthermore, we establish spectral norm error bounds showing that the expected approximation error decays exponentially with the number of passes. Finally, we validate our framework through extensive numerical experiments and demonstrate its practical relevance across multiple applications, including quaternionic data compression, matrix completion, image super-resolution, and deep learning.

Let G be a connected reductive algebraic group over a perfect field. We study the representability of the equivariant automorphism group of G-varieties. For a broad class of complexity-one G-varieties, we show that this group is representable by a group scheme locally of finite type when the base field has characteristic zero. We also establish representability by a linear algebraic group in the case of almost homogeneous G-varieties of arbitrary complexity. Finally, using an exact sequence description of the equivariant automorphism group, we deduce that complexity-one G-varieties with representable equivariant automorphism group admit only finitely many real forms.

Deformations of Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces on Homogeneous Subvarieties of the Unit Ball

Comments:
This paper is based on the research thesis entitled "Deformations of Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces on Homogeneous Varieties". 48 pages
Subjects:
Functional Analysis (math.FA); Operator Algebras (math.OA)
We study the relationships between a subvariety of the open unit ball in the complex $d$-dimensional space $\mathbb{C}^{d}$, the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) obtained by restricting the Drury-Arveson space to the variety, and its multiplier algebra.
We show that when two such RKHSs are almost isometrically isomorphic as RKHSs, their multiplier algebras are likewise almost completely isometrically isomorphic as multiplier algebras. In such cases, the underlying varieties are almost automorphically equivalent. For tractable homogeneous varieties, we further show that if the corresponding multiplier algebras are almost completely isometrically isomorphic as multiplier algebras or one variety is almost the image of the other under a unitary transformation, then the associated RKHSs are almost isometrically isomorphic as RKHSs.

Homotopies for Lagrangian field theory

Subjects:

Consider the variational bicomplex for $\mathcal{E}$ the space of sections of a graded, affine bundle. Local functionals $\mathcal{F}$ are defined as an equivalence class of density-valued functionals, which represent Lagrangian densities. A choice of a $k$-symplectic local form $\omega$ on $\mathcal{E}$ induces a Lie$[k]$ algebra structure on (Hamiltonian) local functionals $(\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{ham}},\{\cdot,\cdot\}_{\mathrm{ham}})$. For any $\omega$ and any choice of a cohomological vector field $Q$ compatible with $\omega$, we build three explicit $L_\infty$ algebras on a resolution of $\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{ham}}$, which are all $L_\infty$ quasi-isomorphic to a dgL$[k]$a $(\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{ham}},d_{\mathrm{ham}},\{\cdot,\cdot\}_{\mathrm{ham}})$. In particular, one of our equivalent $L_\infty$ algebras is a dgL$[k]$ algebra. In the case $k=-1$, this provides an explicit lift of the standard Batalin--Vilkovisky framework to local forms enriched by the $L_\infty$ structure, in terms of local homotopies, which interprets the modified classical master equation as a Maurer--Cartan equation for the distinguished dgL$[k]$a we construct. We further provide a multisymplectic interpretation of the resulting data.

Sum Capacity Characterization of Pinching Antennas-assisted Multiple Access Channels
Guangji Chen, Qingqing Wu, Kangda Zhi, Xidong Mu, Yuanwei Liu
Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT)
Pinching antenna system (PASS) has recently shown its promising ability to flexibly reconfigure wireless channels via dynamically adjusting the positions of pinching antennas over a dielectric waveguide, termed as pinching beamforming. This paper studies the fundamental limit of the sum rate for a PASS-assisted multiple access channel, where multiple users transmit individual messages to a base station under the average power constraint. To this end, a dynamic pinching beamforming setup is conceived, where multiple pinching beamforming vectors are employed in a transmission period and the capacity-achieving non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) based scheme is considered. For the ideal case with an asymptotically large number of pinching beamforming vectors, the optimal transmission scheme is unveiled to carry out alternating transmission among each user whose channel power gain is maximized with the tailored pinching beamforming. This implies that NOMA is not needed for achieving the sum capacity and the required optimal number of pinching beamforming vectors is equal to the number of users. With this insight, the corresponding sum rate is derived in closed-form expression, which serves as the upper bound of the sum rate. Inspired by this result, a lower bound of the sum rate under an arbitrarily finite number of pinching beamforming vectors is obtained. Numerical results validate our theoretical findings and also illustrate the practical significance of using dynamic pinching beamforming to improve the sum rate.

Bang-Ride Optimal Control: Monotonicity, External Positivity, and Fast Battery Charging

Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC); Systems and Control (eess.SY)
This work studies a class of optimal control problems with scalar inputs and general constraints, whose solutions follow a bang-ride pattern that always activates a constraint and enables efficient numerical computation. As a motivating example, fast battery charging leads to computationally demanding optimal control problems when detailed electrochemical models are used. Recently proposed optimization-free heuristics reduce this computational cost while producing input profiles observed in practice, following a bang-ride pattern and applying the maximum feasible input. We investigate when such heuristics satisfy necessary optimality conditions. By leveraging Pontryagin's maximum principle, we unify and formalize existing insights on the bang-ride structure and on the optimal control attaining the maximum feasible input under monotonicity. We further establish a novel connection between the structured optimal control and the external positivity of the costate dynamics. These results provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for heuristic charging strategies and explain the efficiency of optimization-free algorithms.

We obtain an upper bound on the heat kernel of the Keller-Segel finite particle system that exhibits blow up effects. The proof exploits a connection between Keller-Segel finite particles and certain non-local operators. The latter allows to address some aspects of the critical behaviour of the Keller-Segel system resulting from its two-dimensionality.

Cohomologically Calibrated Affine Connections and Forced Irreducibility

Subjects:

We establish a principle of forced geometric irreducibility on product manifolds. We prove that for any product manifold $M=M_1\times M_2$, a cohomologically calibrated affine connection, $\nabla^{\mathcal{C}}$, is necessarily holonomically irreducible, provided its calibration class $[\omega] \in H^3(M;\mathbb{R})$ is mixed. The core of the proof relies on Hodge theory; we show that the algebraic structure of the harmonic part of the torsion generates non-zero off-diagonal components in the full Riemann curvature tensor, which cannot be globally cancelled. This non-cancellation is formally proven via an integral argument. We illustrate the main theorem with explicit constructions on $S^2\times \Sigma_g$, showing that this result holds even in special cases where the Ricci tensor is diagonal, such as the Einstein-calibrated connection. Finally, we briefly discuss speculative analogies between forced irreducibility and quantum entanglement.

AirBreath Sensing: Protecting Over-the-Air Distributed Sensing Against Interference
Zhanwei Wang, Mingyao Cui, Huiling Yang, Qunsong Zeng, Min Sheng, Kaibin Huang
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
A distinctive function of sixth-generation (6G) networks is the integration of distributed sensing and edge artificial intelligence (AI) to enable intelligent perception of the physical world. This resultant platform, termed integrated sensing and edge AI (ISEA), is envisioned to enable a broad spectrum of Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, including remote surgery, autonomous driving, and holographic telepresence. Recently, the communication bottleneck confronting the implementation of an ISEA system is overcome by the development of over-the-air computing (AirComp) techniques, which facilitate simultaneous access through over-the-air data feature fusion. Despite its advantages, AirComp with uncoded transmission remains vulnerable to interference. To tackle this challenge, we propose AirBreath sensing, a spectrum-efficient framework that cascades feature compression and spread spectrum to mitigate interference without bandwidth expansion. This work reveals a fundamental tradeoff between these two operations under a fixed bandwidth constraint: increasing the compression ratio may reduce sensing accuracy but allows for more aggressive interference suppression via spread spectrum, and vice versa. This tradeoff is regulated by a key variable called breathing depth, defined as the feature subspace dimension that matches the processing gain in spread spectrum. To optimally control the breathing depth, we mathematically characterize and optimize this aforementioned tradeoff by designing a tractable surrogate for sensing accuracy, measured by classification discriminant gain (DG). Experimental results on real datasets demonstrate that AirBreath sensing effectively mitigates interference in ISEA systems, and the proposed control algorithm achieves near-optimal performance as benchmarked with a brute-force search.

Exponentiable virtual double categories and presheaves for double categories
Nathanael Arkor
Comments:
37 pages; v2: minor clarifications
Subjects:
Category Theory (math.CT)
Given a pair of pseudo double categories $\mathbb A$ and $\mathbb B$, the lax functors from $\mathbb A$ to $\mathbb B$, along with their transformations, modules, and multimodulations, assemble into a virtual double category $\mathbf{\mathbb Lax}(\mathbb A, \mathbb B)$. We exhibit a universal property of this construction by observing that it arises naturally from the consideration of exponentiability for virtual double categories. In particular, we show that every pseudo double category is exponentiable as a virtual double category, whereby the virtual double category $\mathbf{\mathbb Lax}(\mathbb A, \mathbb B)$ of lax functors arises as the virtual double category $\mathbf{\mathbb Mod}(\mathbb B^{\mathbb A})$ of monads and modules in the exponential $\mathbb B^{\mathbb A}$. We explore some consequences of this characterisation, demonstrating that it facilitates simple proofs of statements that heretofore required unwieldy computations. For instance, we deduce that the 2-category of pseudo double categories and lax functors is enriched in the 2-category of normal virtual double categories, and demonstrate that several aspects of the Yoneda theory of pseudo double categories - such as the correspondence between presheaves and discrete fibrations - are substantially simplified by this perspective.

Critical fluctuations of last passage percolation with thick boundaries

Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
We consider the exponential last passage percolation (LPP) with thick two-sided boundary that consists of a few inhomogeneous columns and rows. Ben Arous and Corwin previously studied the limit fluctuations in this model except in a critical regime, for which they predicted that the limit distribution exists and depends only on the most dominant columns and rows. In this article, we prove their conjecture and identify the limit distribution explicitly in terms of a Fredholm determinant of a $2 \times 2$ matrix kernel. This result leads in particular to an explicit variational formula for the one-point marginal of the KPZ fixed point for a new class of initial conditions. Our limit distribution is also a novel generalization of and provides a new numerically efficient representation for the Baik--Rains distribution.

Law of the iterated logarithm for supercritical non-local spatial branching processes
Haojie Hou, Ting Yang
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
Suppose that $X=(X_{t})_{t\ge 0}$ is either a general supercritical non-local branching Markov process, or a general supercritical non-local superprocess, on a Luzin space. Here, by ``supercritical" we mean that the mean semigroup of $X$ exhibits a Perron-Frobenius type behaviour with a positive principal eigenvalue. In this paper, we study the almost sure behaviour of a family of martingales naturally associated with the real or complex-valued eigenpairs of the mean semigroup. Under a fourth-moment condition, we establish limit theorems of the iterated logarithm type for these martingales. In particular, we discover three regimes, each resulting in different scaling factors and limits. Furthermore, we obtain a law of the iterated logarithm for the linear functional $\langle \mathrm{Re}(f),X_{t}\rangle$ where $f$ is a sum of finite terms of eigenfunctions and $\mathrm{Re}(f)$ denotes its real part. In the context of branching Markov processes, our results improve on existing literature by complementing the known results for multitype branching processes in Asmussen [Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 231 (1) (1977) 233--248] and generalizing the recent work of Hou, Ren and Song [arXiv: 2505.12691] to allow for non-local branching mechanism and non-symmetric spatial motion. For superprocesses, as far as we know, our results are new.

This paper presents the concept of representations for matched pairs of Poisson algebras and constructs corresponding cohomology theories. The application of these cohomology groups within the framework of matched pairs is also examined. We begin by employing cohomology to study infinitesimal deformations and abelian extensions of such matched pairs. Subsequently, given an abelian extension along with a representation, we analyze the inducibility conditions for pairs of automorphisms, establishing both necessary and sufficient criteria. Finally, the Wells exact sequences for matched pairs of Poisson algebras are constructed, which provide a deeper characterization of the inducibility problem.

How to build a Hopf algebra

Comments:
74 pages
Subjects:
Category Theory (math.CT); Algebraic Topology (math.AT); Quantum Algebra (math.QA)
We construct a functor that inputs a retract in an $(\infty,3)$-category satisfying some adjunctibility conditions and outputs a Hopf algebra in a braided monoidal $(\infty,1)$-category. Provided the braided monoidal category is presentable, any Hopf algebra can be obtained in this way. Our functor specializes to - and provides a higher-categorical explanation for - the Tannakian reconstruction of a Hopf algebra from a monoidal category with duals and a fiber functor. Towards this end, we review and develop the lax (aka Gray) tensor product $\otimes$ of $(\infty,\infty)$-categories, and we analyze the "lax smash product" of pointed $(\infty,\infty)$-categories. We compute the lax-$\wedge$-square of the "walking adjunction" and show that its $3$-localization corepresents retracts with some adjunctibilty conditions, whereas the $3$-localization of the lax-$\wedge$-square of the "walking monad" corepresents bialgebras. In these terms, our functor is restriction along the lax-$\wedge$-square of the inclusion $\{\text{walking monad}\} \to \{\text{walking adjunction}\}$. After $3$-localization, we show that this restriction inverts a certain shear map, proving the existence of an antipode. We discuss generalizations of this construction to Hopf monads, analyze additional adjunctibility conditions and their interplay with integrals and cointegrals, and finally explain how variants of classical Tannakian reconstruction fit into our scheme.

In contrast to their work, in \cite{GanLiVianaYang2021}, they provided an example of a non-invertible embedding in the case $\dim(E^{cs}) = 2$. The inverse map of the DA we constructed has a mostly expanding center (\cite{AnderssonVasquez2018}). Using a similar approach, we can also construct a (nontrivial) mixed center (\cite{MiCaoYang2017, MiCao2021}).

A group is called an involutive Yang-Baxter group (IYB-group) if it is isomorphic to the permutation group of an involutive, non-degenerate set-theoretic solution of the Yang-Baxter equation. This paper investigates finite soluble groups whose Sylow subgroups have nilpotency class at most two, addressing Cedó and Okniński's question~\cite{CedoOkninski2025} of whether such groups are IYB-groups. We establish that a finite soluble group with Sylow subgroups of class at most two is an IYB-group if its nilpotent residual is $\Q_8$-free. We also prove that a finite soluble group with Sylow subgroups of class at most two and Sylow $2$-subgroups isomorphic to $Q_8$ is an IYB-group.

A Monte Carlo Approach for Nonsmooth Convex Optimization via Proximal Splitting Algorithms

Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
Operator splitting algorithms are a cornerstone of modern first-order optimization, relying critically on proximal operators as their fundamental building blocks. However, explicit formulas for proximal operators are available only for limited classes of functions, restricting the applicability of these methods. Recent work introduced HJ-Prox, a zeroth-order Monte Carlo approximation of the proximal operator derived from Hamilton-Jacobi PDEs, which circumvents the need for closed-form solutions. In this work, we extend the scope of HJ-Prox by establishing that it can be seamlessly incorporated into operator splitting schemes while preserving convergence guarantees. In particular, we show that replacing exact proximal steps with HJ-Prox approximations in algorithms such as proximal gradient descent, Douglas-Rachford splitting, Davis-Yin splitting, and the primal-dual hybrid gradient method still ensures convergence under mild conditions.

We prove that the product of any two infinite countable groups has fixed price one. This resolves a problem posed by Gaboriau. The proof uses the propagation method to construct a Poisson horoball process as a weak factor of i.i.d. Then, a low-cost graphing of this process is constructed by connecting the points of each horoball first, and then adding a percolation with small intensity. The connectedness of this graphing is ensured by proving that the resulting horoballs have the infinite touching property almost surely, if the metric and the other parameters of the construction are chosen carefully.

Let $\mathscr A$ be the Steenrod algebra over the field of characteristic two, $\mathbb F_2.$ Denote by $GL(q)$ the general linear group of rank $q$ over $\mathbb F_2.$ The algebraic transfer, introduced by W. Singer [Math. Z. 202 (1989), 493-523], is a rather effective tool for unraveling the intricate structure of the (mod-2) cohomology of the Steenrod algebra, ${\rm Ext}_{\mathscr A}^{q,*}(\mathbb F_2, \mathbb F_2).$ The Kameko homomorphism is one of the useful tools to study the dimension of the domain of the Singer transfer. Singer conjectured that the algebraic transfer is always a monomorphism, but this remains open for all homology degrees $q\geq 5.$ In this paper, by constructing a novel algorithm implemented in the computer algebra system OSCAR for computing $GL(q)$-invariants of the kernel of the Kameko homomorphism, we disprove Singer's conjecture for bidegree $(6, 6+36).$

Spare Strategy Analysis and Design for Large-Scale Satellite Constellation Using Markov Chain

Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
This paper presents a method for analyzing and designing an optimal spare-management policy in large-scale satellite constellations using a Markov chain model. To capture the stochastic nature of satellite failures and launch vehicle lead times, we adopt Markov chains to model both failure and replenishment processes. We reinvestigate an indirect spare strategy, modeled as a multi-echelon periodic-review reorder-point/order-quantity policy, in which spares are first delivered to parking orbits and then transferred to constellation planes. The stock levels in constellation and parking orbits are each modeled as independent Markov chains, and a fixed-point iteration yields a consistent joint stationary solution that describes the strategy's average behavior. This approach accurately captures the stochastic interplay within a multi-echelon model driven by orbital mechanics, avoiding the aggregation assumptions of prior works and remaining valid across a wider operating domain. Building on this fast, accurate analysis, we formulate an optimization problem and solve it via a genetic algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate the practical value of both the analysis method and the optimization framework in a real-world mega-constellation case study.

General Mathematics (math.GM)
We present an equivalent form of Vizing's conjecture gamma(G square H) >= gamma(G)gamma(H) using a simple domination-density lens. Defining rho_G = gamma(G)/|V(G)|, the conjecture becomes rho_{G square H} >= rho_G rho_H, that is, the domination density of the Cartesian product is equal to or larger than the product of the domination densities of the original graphs. Selecting valid upper bounds such that rho_G <= rho tilde G, rho_H <= rho tilde H and a product lower bound such that rho_{G square H} >= rho tilde {G square H}, we obtain the simple test rho tilde {G square H} >= rho tilde G rho tilde H which certifies Vizing's conjecture whenever it holds. Examples include: (i) bipartite graph pairs whose bipartitions are sufficiently uneven compared to the maximum degree, yielding infinite nontrivial families, and (ii) the Arnautov-Payan bound, which shows the conjecture holds for all k-regular pairs with k >= 32. The framework is modular and the included bounds are general. Implementing increasingly sharp family-specific bounds can further expand the certified parameter regimes for which Vizing's conjecture holds.

We give a sufficient condition for an $\mathbb{S}^1$-bundle over a $3$-manifold to admit an immersion (or embedding) into $\mathbb{C}^3$ so that its complex tangencies define an Engel structure. In particular, every oriented $\mathbb{S}^1$-bundle over a closed, oriented $3$-manifold admits such an immersion. If the bundle is trivial, this immersion can be chosen to be an embedding and, moreover, infinitely many pairwise smoothly non-isotopic embeddings of this type can be constructed. These are the first examples of compact submanifolds of $\mathbb{C}^3$ whose complex tangencies are Engel, answering a question of Y. Eliashberg.

For a natural number $k>1$, let $f_k(n)$ denote the number of distinct representations of a natural number $n$ of the form $p^k+q^k$ for primes $p,q$. We prove that, for all $k>1$,
$$\limsup_{n\to\infty}f_k(n)=\infty.$$
This positively answers a conjecture of Erdos, which asks if there are natural numbers $n$ with arbitrarily many distinct representations of the form $p_1^k+p_2^k+\dots+p_k^k$ for primes $p_1,p_2,\dots,p_k$.

Quantum instruments are mathematical devices introduced to describe the conditional state change during a quantum process. They are completely positive map valued measures on measurable spaces. We may also view them as non-commutative analogues of joint probability measures. We analyze the $C^*$-convexity structure of spaces of quantum instruments. A complete description of the $C^*$-extreme instruments in finite dimensions has been established. Further, the implications of $C^*$-extremity between quantum instruments and their marginals has been explored.

Non-split sharply 2-transitive groups of bounded exponent

Subjects:
Group Theory (math.GR)
We construct here the first known examples of non-split sharply 2-transitive groups of bounded exponent in odd positive characteristic for every large enough prime $p \equiv 3 \pmod{4}$. In fact, we show that there are countably many pairwise non-isomorphic countable non-split sharply 2-transitive groups of characteristic $p$ for each such $p$. Furthermore, we construct non-periodic non-split sharply 2-transitive groups (of these same characteristics) with centralizers of involutions of bounded exponent. As a consequence of these results, we answer two open questions about sharply 2-transitive and 2-transitive permutation groups. The constructions of groups as announced rely on iteratively applying (geometric) small cancellation methods in the presence of involutions. To that end, we develop a method to control some small cancellation parameters in the presence of even-order torsion.

Title:
A Two-fold Randomization Framework for Impulse Control Problems
Haoyang Cao, Yuchao Dong, Zhouhao Yang
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
We propose and analyze a randomization scheme for a general class of impulse control problems. The solution to this randomized problem is characterized as the fixed point of a compound operator which consists of a regularized nonlocal operator and a regularized stopping operator. This approach allows us to derive a semi-linear Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. Through an equivalent randomization scheme with a Poisson compound measure, we establish a verification theorem that implies the uniqueness of the solution. Via an iterative approach, we prove the existence of the solution. The existence-and-uniqueness result ensures the randomized problem is well-defined. We then demonstrate that our randomized impulse control problem converges to its classical counterpart as the randomization parameter $\pmb \lambda$ vanishes. This convergence, combined with the value function's $C^{2,\alpha}_{loc}$ regularity, confirms our framework provides a robust approximation and a foundation for developing learning algorithms. Under this framework, we propose an offline reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm. Its policy improvement step is naturally derived from the iterative approach from the existence proof, which enjoys a geometric convergence rate. We implement a model-free version of the algorithm and numerically demonstrate its effectiveness using a widely-studied example. The results show that our RL algorithm can learn the randomized solution, which accurately approximates its classical counterpart. A sensitivity analysis with respect to the volatility parameter $\sigma$ in the state process effectively demonstrates the exploration-exploitation tradeoff.

Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
We analyze the dynamics of concentrated polymer solutions modeled by a 2D Smoluchowski equation. We describe the long time behavior of the polymer suspensions in a fluid.
When the flow influence is neglected the equation has a gradient structure. The presence of a simple flow introduces significant structural changes in the dynamics. We study the case of an externally imposed flow with homogeneous gradient. We show that the equation is still dissipative but new phenomena this http URL dynamics depend on both the concentration intensity and the structure of the flow.
In certain limit cases the equation has a gradient structure, in an appropriate reference frame, and the solutions evolve to either a steady state or a tumbling wave. For small perturbations of the gradient structure we show that for small concentrations the solutions evolve in the long time limit to a steady state. However for high concentrations there is a rigidity phenomenon for the tumbling wave.

We consider a class of optimal liquidation problems where the agent's transactions create transient price impact driven by a Volterra-type propagator along with temporary price impact. We formulate these problems as maximization of a revenue-risk functionals, where the agent also exploits available information on a progressively measurable price predicting signal. By using an infinite dimensional stochastic control approach, we characterize the value function in terms of a solution to a free-boundary $L^2$-valued backward stochastic differential equation and an operator-valued Riccati equation. We then derive analytic solutions to these equations which yields an explicit expression for the optimal trading strategy. We show that our formulas can be implemented in a straightforward and efficient way for a large class of price impact kernels with possible singularities such as the power-law kernel.

Composite Classical and Quantum Channel Discrimination

Subjects:
Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
We study the problem of binary composite channel discrimination in the asymmetric setting, where the hypotheses are given by fairly arbitrary sets of channels, and samples do not have to be identically distributed. In the case of quantum channels we prove: (i) a characterization of the Stein exponent for parallel channel discrimination strategies and (ii) an upper bound on the Stein exponent for adaptive channel discrimination strategies. We further show that already for classical channels this upper bound can sometimes be achieved and be strictly larger than what is possible with parallel strategies. Hence, there can be an advantage of adaptive channel discrimination strategies with composite hypotheses for classical channels, unlike in the case of simple hypotheses. Moreover, we show that classically this advantage can only exist if the sets of channels corresponding to the hypotheses are non-convex. As a consequence of our more general treatment, which is not limited to the composite i.i.d. setting, we also obtain a generalization of previous composite state discrimination results.

Tracially embeddable strategies: Lifting MIP* tricks to MIPco

Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Operator Algebras (math.OA)
We prove that any two-party correlation in the commuting operator model can be approximated using a tracially embeddable strategy, a class of strategies defined on a finite tracial von Neumann algebra, which we define in this paper. Using this characterization, we show that any approximately synchronous correlation can be approximated to the average of a collection of synchronous correlations in the commuting operator model. This generalizes the result from Vidick [JMP 2022] which only applies to finite-dimensional quantum correlations. As a corollary, we show that the quantum tensor code test from Ji et al. [FOCS 2022] follows the soundness property even under the general commuting operator model.
Furthermore, we extend the state-dependent norm variant of the Gowers-Hatami theorem to finite von Neumann algebras. Combined with the aforementioned characterization, this enables us to lift many known results about robust self-testing for non-local games to the commuting operator model, including a sample efficient finite-dimensional EPR testing for the commuting operator strategies. We believe that, in addition to the contribution from this paper, this class of strategies can be helpful for further understanding non-local games in the infinite-dimensional setting.

Blumer et al. (1987, 1989) showed that any concept class that is learnable by Occam algorithms is PAC learnable. Board and Pitt (1990) showed a partial converse of this theorem: for concept classes that are closed under exception lists, any class that is PAC learnable is learnable by an Occam algorithm. However, their Occam algorithm outputs a hypothesis whose complexity is $\delta$-dependent, which is an important limitation. In this paper, we show that their partial converse applies to Occam algorithms with $\delta$-independent complexities as well. Thus, we provide a posteriori justification of various theoretical results and algorithm design methods which use the partial converse as a basis for their work.

Asymptotic Theory of the Best-Choice Rerandomization using the Mahalanobis Distance
Yuhao Wang, Xinran Li
Subjects:
Methodology (stat.ME); Statistics Theory (math.ST)
Rerandomization, a design that utilizes pretreatment covariates and improves their balance between different treatment groups, has received attention recently in both theory and practice. From a survey by Bruhn and McKenzie (2009), there are at least two types of rerandomization that are used in practice: the first rerandomizes the treatment assignment until covariate imbalance is below a prespecified threshold; the second randomizes the treatment assignment multiple times and chooses the one with the best covariate balance. In this paper we will consider the second type of rerandomization, namely the best-choice rerandomization, whose theory and inference are still lacking in the literature. In particular, we will focus on the best-choice rerandomization that uses the Mahalanobis distance to measure covariate imbalance, which is one of the most commonly used imbalance measure for multivariate covariates and is invariant to affine transformations of covariates. We will study the large-sample repeatedly sampling properties of the best-choice rerandomization, allowing both the number of covariates and the number of tried complete randomizations to increase with the sample size. We show that the asymptotic distribution of the difference-in-means estimator is more concentrated around the true average treatment effect under rerandomization than under the complete randomization, and propose large-sample accurate confidence intervals for rerandomization that are shorter than that for the completely randomized experiment. We further demonstrate that, with moderate number of covariates and with the number of tried randomizations increasing polynomially with the sample size, the best-choice rerandomization can achieve the ideally optimal precision that one can expect even with perfectly balanced covariates. The developed theory and methods are also illustrated using real field experiments.

Belnap-Dunn logic, also knows as the logic of First-Degree Entailment, is a logic that can serve as the underlying logic of theories that are inconsistent or incomplete. For various reasons, different expansions of Belnap-Dunn logic with non-classical connectives have been studied. This paper investigates the question whether those expansions are interdefinable with an expansion whose connectives include only classical connectives. Surprisingly, this relevant question is not addressed anywhere in the published studies. The notion of interdefinability of logics used is based on a general notion of definability of a connective in a logic that seems to have been forgotten. Attention is also paid to the extent to which the expansion whose connectives include only classical connectives is related to the version of classical logic with the same connectives.

The standard approach to universal fault-tolerant quantum computing is to develop a general purpose quantum error correction mechanism that can implement a universal set of logical gates fault-tolerantly. Given such a scheme, any quantum algorithm can be realized fault-tolerantly by composing the relevant logical gates from this set. However, we know that quantum computers provide a significant quantum advantage only for specific quantum algorithms. Hence, a universal quantum computer can likely gain from compiling such specific algorithms using tailored quantum error correction schemes. In this work, we take the first steps towards such algorithm-tailored quantum fault-tolerance. We consider Trotter circuits in quantum simulation, which is an important application of quantum computing. We develop a solve-and-stitch algorithm to systematically synthesize physical realizations of Clifford Trotter circuits on the well-known $\llbr n,n-2,2 \rrbr$ error-detecting code family. Our analysis shows that this family implements Trotter circuits with essentially optimal depth under reasonable assumptions, thereby serving as an illuminating example of tailored quantum error correction. We achieve fault-tolerance for these circuits using flag gadgets, which add minimal overhead. Importantly, the solve-and-stitch algorithm has the potential to scale beyond this specific example, as illustrated by a generalization to the four-qubit logical Clifford Trotter circuit on the $\llbr 20,4,2 \rrbr$ hypergraph product code, thereby providing a principled approach to tailored fault-tolerance in quantum computing.

Solving Truly Massive Budgeted Monotonic POMDPs with Oracle-Guided Meta-Reinforcement Learning

Machine Learning (cs.LG); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Optimization and Control (math.OC)
Monotonic Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), where the system state progressively decreases until a restorative action is performed, can be used to model sequential repair problems effectively. This paper considers the problem of solving budget-constrained multi-component monotonic POMDPs, where a finite budget limits the maximal number of restorative actions. For a large number of components, solving such a POMDP using current methods is computationally intractable due to the exponential growth in the state space with an increasing number of components. To address this challenge, we propose a two-step approach. Since the individual components of a budget-constrained multi-component monotonic POMDP are only connected via the shared budget, we first approximate the optimal budget allocation among these components using an approximation of each component POMDP's optimal value function which is obtained through a random forest model. Subsequently, we introduce an oracle-guided meta-trained Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to solve each of the independent budget-constrained single-component monotonic POMDPs. The oracle policy is obtained by performing value iteration on the corresponding monotonic Markov Decision Process (MDP). This two-step method provides scalability in solving truly massive multi-component monotonic POMDPs. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, we consider a real-world maintenance scenario that involves inspection and repair of an administrative building by a team of agents within a maintenance budget. Finally, we perform a computational complexity analysis for a varying number of components to show the scalability of the proposed approach.

The Converse of the Real Orthogonal Holant Theorem

Subjects:

The Holant theorem is a powerful tool for studying the computational complexity of counting problems in the Holant framework. Due to the great expressiveness of the Holant framework, a converse to the Holant theorem would itself be a very powerful counting indistinguishability theorem. The most general converse does not hold, but we prove the following, still highly general, version: if any two sets of real-valued signatures are Holant-indistinguishable, then they are equivalent up to an orthogonal transformation. This resolves a partially open conjecture of Xia (2010). Consequences of this theorem include the well-known result that homomorphism counts from all graphs determine a graph up to isomorphism, the classical sufficient condition for simultaneous orthogonal similarity of sets of real matrices, and a combinatorial characterization of simultaneosly orthogonally decomposable (odeco) sets of symmetric tensors.

A Statistical Analysis of Deep Federated Learning for Intrinsically Low-dimensional Data

Despite significant research on the optimization aspects of federated learning, the exploration of generalization error, especially in the realm of heterogeneous federated learning, remains an area that has been insufficiently investigated, primarily limited to developments in the parametric regime. This paper delves into the generalization properties of deep federated regression within a two-stage sampling model. Our findings reveal that the intrinsic dimension, characterized by the entropic dimension, plays a pivotal role in determining the convergence rates for deep learners when appropriately chosen network sizes are employed. Specifically, when the true relationship between the response and explanatory variables is described by a $\beta$-Hölder function and one has access to $n$ independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) samples from $m$ participating clients, for participating clients, the error rate scales at most as $\Tilde{O}((mn)^{-2\beta/(2\beta + \bar{d}_{2\beta}(\lambda))})$, whereas for non-participating clients, it scales as $\Tilde{O}(\Delta \cdot m^{-2\beta/(2\beta + \bar{d}_{2\beta}(\lambda))} + (mn)^{-2\beta/(2\beta + \bar{d}_{2\beta}(\lambda))})$. Here $\bar{d}_{2\beta}(\lambda)$ denotes the corresponding $2\beta$-entropic dimension of $\lambda$, the marginal distribution of the explanatory variables. The dependence between the two stages of the sampling scheme is characterized by $\Delta$. Consequently, our findings not only explicitly incorporate the ``heterogeneity" of the clients, but also highlight that the convergence rates of errors of deep federated learners are not contingent on the nominal high dimensionality of the data but rather on its intrinsic dimension.

Quantum many-body scars through the lens of correlation matrix

Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) -- rare eigenstates that evade thermalization -- are typically characterized by their low entanglement entropies compared to surrounding thermal eigenstates. However, due to finite-size effects in systems accessible via exact diagonalization, this measure can be ambiguous. To address this limitation, we propose using the correlation matrix spectrum as an alternative probe to identify QMBS. In cases of exact QMBS that either have known analytic expressions or are captured by various frameworks of QMBS, we find that the dimensionality of the null space of the correlation matrix -- an integer value, and thus immune to finite-size effects -- can qualitatively identify QMBS. Beyond serving as a diagnostic tool, the correlation matrix method enables the manipulation of the QMBS subspace. For approximate QMBS, such as those in the PXP model, we observe that the correlation matrix spectrum features numerous approximate zero eigenvalues, thereby distinguishing these states. We demonstrate the effectiveness and utility of this method with several paradigmatic QMBS examples.

We investigate unitary and state $t$-designs from a computational complexity perspective. First, we address the problems of computing frame potentials that characterize (approximate) $t$-designs. We present a quantum algorithm for computing frame potentials and establish the following: (1) exact computation can be achieved by a single query to a $\# \textsf{P}$-oracle and is $\# \textsf{P}$-hard; (2) for state vectors, deciding whether the frame potential is larger than or smaller than certain values is $\textsf{BQP}$-complete, provided the promise gap between the two values is inverse-polynomial in the number of qubits; and (3) for both state vectors and unitaries, this promise problem is $\textsf{PP}$-complete if the promise gap is exponentially small. Second, we address the promise problem of deciding whether or not a given set is a good approximation to a design. Given a certain promise gap that could be constant, we show that this problem is $\textsf{PP}$-hard, highlighting the inherent computational difficulty of determining properties of unitary and state designs. We further identify the implications of our results across diverse areas, including variational methods for constructing designs, diagnosing quantum chaos through out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs), and exploring emergent designs in Hamiltonian systems.

This paper examines reinforcement learning (RL) in infinite-horizon decision processes with almost-sure safety constraints, crucial for applications like autonomous systems, finance, and resource management. We propose a doubly-regularized RL framework combining reward and parameter regularization to address safety constraints in continuous state-action spaces. The problem is formulated as a convex regularized objective with parametrized policies in the mean-field regime. Leveraging mean-field theory and Wasserstein gradient flows, policies are modeled on an infinite-dimensional statistical manifold, with updates governed by parameter distribution gradient flows. Key contributions include solvability conditions for safety-constrained problems, smooth bounded approximations for gradient flows, and exponential convergence guarantees under sufficient regularization. General regularization conditions, including entropy regularization, support practical particle method implementations. This framework provides robust theoretical insights and guarantees for safe RL in complex, high-dimensional settings.

We examine the role of unitary transformations in enhancing violations of the Bell-CHSH inequality in relativistic quantum field theory. In quantum systems, all relevant observables can be expressed via unitary rotations of reference operators. We extend this perspective to a real massive free scalar field and to the Proca vector field in $(1+1)$ Minkowski spacetime. In two dimensions, the Proca theory carries only one degree of freedom and is known to be equivalent to the scalar theory, implying that both yield identical Bell-CHSH violations. After introducing suitable Hermitian operators, we employ Tomita-Takesaki modular theory to construct spacelike separated observables in the vacuum. We demonstrate that unitary deformations significantly increase the Bell-CHSH violation, approaching the Tsirelson bound, and we report the first explicit evaluation of such violation in a vector-field vacuum.

Understanding Generalization in Physics Informed Models through Affine Variety Dimensions

Physics-informed machine learning is gaining significant traction for enhancing statistical performance and sample efficiency through the integration of physical knowledge. However, current theoretical analyses often presume complete prior knowledge in non-hybrid settings, overlooking the crucial integration of observational data, and are frequently limited to linear systems, unlike the prevalent nonlinear nature of many real-world applications. To address these limitations, we introduce a unified residual form that unifies collocation and variational methods, enabling the incorporation of incomplete and complex physical constraints in hybrid learning settings. Within this formulation, we establish that the generalization performance of physics-informed regression in such hybrid settings is governed by the dimension of the affine variety associated with the physical constraint, rather than by the number of parameters. This enables a unified analysis that is applicable to both linear and nonlinear equations. We also present a method to approximate this dimension and provide experimental validation of our theoretical findings.

Given a static vertex-selection problem (e.g. independent set, dominating set) on a graph, we can define a corresponding temporally satisfying reconfiguration problem on a temporal graph which asks for a sequence of solutions to the vertex-selection problem at each time such that we can reconfigure from one solution to the next. We can think of each solution in the sequence as a set of vertices with tokens placed on them; our reconfiguration model allows us to slide tokens along active edges of a temporal graph at each time-step.
We show that it is possible to efficiently check whether one solution can be reconfigured to another, and show that approximation results on the static vertex-selection problem can be adapted with a lifetime factor to the reconfiguration version. Our main contributions are fixed-parameter tractable algorithms with respect to: enumeration time of the related static problem; the combination of temporal neighbourhood diversity and lifetime of the input temporal graph; and the combination of lifetime and treewidth of the footprint graph.

Multimodal recommender systems improve the performance of canonical recommender systems with no item features by utilizing diverse content types such as text, images, and videos, while alleviating inherent sparsity of user-item interactions and accelerating user engagement. However, current neural network-based models often incur significant computational overhead due to the complex training process required to learn and integrate information from multiple modalities. To address this challenge,we propose MultiModal-Graph Filtering (MM-GF), a training-free method grounded in graph filtering (GF) for efficient and accurate multimodal recommendations. Specifically, MM-GF first constructs multiple similarity graphs for two distinct modalities as well as user-item interaction data. Then, MM-GF optimally fuses these multimodal signals using a polynomial graph filter that allows for precise control of the frequency response by adjusting frequency bounds. Furthermore, the filter coefficients are treated as hyperparameters, enabling flexible and data-driven adaptation. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that MM-GF not only improves recommendation accuracy by up to 22.25% compared to the best competitor but also dramatically reduces computational costs by achieving the runtime of less than 10 seconds.

Matrix Product States (MPS) and Tensor Networks provide a general framework for the construction of solvable models. The best-known example is the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) model, which is the ground state of a 2-body nearest-neighbor parent Hamiltonian. We show that such simple parent Hamiltonians for MPS models are, in fact, much more prevalent than hitherto known: The existence of a single example with a simple Hamiltonian for a given choice of dimensions already implies that any generic MPS with those dimensions possesses an equally simple Hamiltonian. We illustrate our finding by discussing a number of models with nearest-neighbor parent Hamiltonians, which generalize the AKLT model on various levels.

Despite their groundbreaking performance, state-of-the-art autonomous agents can misbehave when training and environmental conditions become inconsistent, with minor mismatches leading to undesirable behaviors or even catastrophic failures. Robustness towards these training/environment ambiguities is a core requirement for intelligent agents and its fulfillment is a long-standing challenge when deploying agents in the real world. Here, we introduce a Distributionally Robust Free Energy model (DR-FREE) that instills this core property by design. It directly wires robustness into the agent decision-making mechanisms via free energy minimization. By combining a robust extension of the free energy principle with a novel resolution engine, DR-FREE returns a policy that is optimal-yet-robust against ambiguity. The policy has an explicit, soft-max, structure that reveals the mechanistic role of ambiguity on optimal decisions and requisite Bayesian belief updating. We evaluate DR-FREE on an experimental testbed involving real rovers navigating an ambiguous environment filled with obstacles. Across all the experiments, DR-FREE enables robots to successfully navigate towards their goal even when, in contrast, state-of-the-art free energy models fail. In short, DR-FREE can tackle scenarios that elude previous methods: this milestone may inspire both deployment in multi-agent settings and, at a perhaps deeper level, the quest for a biologically plausible explanation of how natural agents -- with little or no training -- survive in capricious environments.

On the consistency of stronger lower bounds for NEXP

It was recently shown by Atserias, Buss and Mueller that the standard complexity-theoretic conjecture NEXP not in P / poly is consistent with the relatively strong bounded arithmetic theory V^0_2, which can prove a substantial part of complexity theory. We observe that their approach can be extended to show that the stronger conjectures NEXP not in EXP / poly and NEXP not in coNEXP are consistent with a stronger theory, which includes every true universal number-sort sentence.

Branch-and-Bound Algorithms as Polynomial-time Approximation Schemes

Branch-and-bound algorithms (B&B) and polynomial-time approximation schemes (PTAS) are two seemingly distant areas of combinatorial optimization. We intend to (partially) bridge the gap between them while expanding the boundary of theoretical knowledge on the B\&B framework. Branch-and-bound algorithms typically guarantee that an optimal solution is eventually found. However, we show that the standard implementation of branch-and-bound for certain knapsack and scheduling problems also exhibits PTAS-like behavior, yielding increasingly better solutions within polynomial time. Our findings are supported by computational experiments and comparisons with benchmark methods. This paper is an extended version of a paper accepted at ICALP 2025

Revisiting the relaxation of constraints in gauge theories

Recently, there were works claiming that path integral quantisation of gauge theories necessarily requires relaxation of Lagrangian constraints. As has also been noted in the literature, it is of course wrong since there perfectly exist gauge field quantisations respecting the constraints, and at the same time the very idea of changing the classical theory in this way has many times appeared in other works. On the other hand, what was done in the path integral approach is fixing a gauge in terms of zero-momentum variables. We would like to show that this relaxation is what normally happens when one fixes such a gauge at the level of action principle in a Lagrangian theory. Moreover, there is an interesting analogy to be drawn. Namely, one of the ways to quantise a gauge theory is to build an extended Hamiltonian and then add new conditions by hand such as to make it a second class system. The constraints' relaxation occurs when one does the same at the level of the total Hamiltonian, i.e. a second class system with the primary constraints only.

Subsystem Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases from Subsystem SymTFT of 2-Foliated Exotic Tensor Gauge Theory

Symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT), or topological holography, posits a correspondence between symmetries in a $d$-dimensional theory and topological order in a $(d+1)$-dimensional theory. In this work, we extend this framework to subsystem symmetries and develop subsystem SymTFT as a systematic tool to characterize and classify subsystem symmetry-protected topological (SSPT) phases. For $(2+1)$D gapped phases, we introduce a 2-foliated $(3+1)$D exotic tensor gauge theory (which is equivalent to 2-foliated $(3+1)$D BF theory via exotic duality) as the subsystem SymTFT and systematically analyze its topological boundary conditions and linearly rigid subsystem symmetries. Taking subsystem symmetry groups $G = \mathbb{Z}_N$ and $G=\mathbb{Z}_N \times \mathbb{Z}_M$ as examples, we demonstrate how to recover the classification scheme $\mathcal{C}[G] = H^{2}(G^{\times 2}, U(1)) / \left( H^2(G, U(1)) \right)^3$, which was previously derived by examining topological invariant under linear subsystem-symmetric local unitary transformations in the lattice Hamiltonian formalism. To illustrate the correspondence between field-theoretic and lattice descriptions, we further analyze $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\mathbb{Z}_N \times \mathbb{Z}_M$ cluster state models as concrete examples.

Concrete heterogeneity originates from its production process, which involves bonding aggregates with a binder matrix. This study presents a mesoscale finite element model (MFEM) that offers detailed insights into the fracture process at the aggregate--cement matrix interface, focusing on one of concrete's key properties: its mechanical response. Unlike discrete models, which often average out critical stress concentrations within the mesostructure, the MFEM approach captures detailed stress distributions, revealing localized effects crucial for understanding damage evolution.
Although computationally more demanding, the MFEM leverages modern high-performance computing (HPC) to provide a detailed description of the stress field and material damage across different phases and interfaces. The proposed modeling framework integrates a collision-checked aggregate generation procedure, Voronoi-based mesostructure construction, and adaptive 3D meshing, forming a reusable methodology for stress analysis in heterogeneous composites. This approach offers transparent, physically interpretable parameterization of phase properties in contrast to black-box discrete models.
Another methodological contribution is the statistical post-processing of stress data using histogram-based analysis across cross-sectional planes. This enables quantitative evaluation of stress concentration distributions, providing valuable insights into the mesoscale mechanical response and serving as a useful visualization tool for researchers working on heterogeneous material modeling. Various matrix-to-aggregate stiffness ratios are considered to evaluate the influence of material heterogeneity on the stress field.

Quasibound states of massive charged scalars around dilaton black holes in $2+1$ dimensions: Exact frequencies
H. S. Vieira
Comments:
9 pages, 3 figures, updated version
Subjects:

In this work, we investigate massive charged scalar perturbations in the background of three-dimensional dilaton black holes with a cosmological constant. We demonstrate that the wave equations governing the dynamics of these perturbations are exactly solvable, with the radial part expressible in terms of confluent Heun functions. The quasibound state frequencies are computed analytically, and we examine their dependence on the scalar field's mass and charge, as well as on the black hole's mass and electric charge. Our analysis also underscores the crucial role played by the cosmological constant in shaping the behavior of these perturbations. This specific black hole metric arises as a solution to the low-energy effective action of string theory in $2+1$ dimensions, and it holds potential for experimental realization in analog gravity systems due to the similarity between its surface gravity and that of acoustic analogs. Moreover, the analytic tractability of this system offers a valuable testing ground for exploring aspects of black hole spectroscopy, stability, and quantum field theory in curved spacetime. The exact solvability facilitates deeper insights into the interplay between geometry and matter fields in lower-dimensional gravity, where quantum gravitational effects can be more pronounced. Such studies not only enrich our understanding of dilaton gravity and its string-theoretic implications but also pave the way for potential applications in simulating black hole phenomena in laboratory settings using analog models.

Stochastic Optimal Control via Measure Relaxations

The optimal control problem of stochastic systems is commonly solved via robust or scenario-based optimization methods, which are both challenging to scale to long optimization horizons. We cast the optimal control problem of a stochastic system as a convex optimization problem over occupation measures. We demonstrate our method on a set of synthetic and real-world scenarios, learning cost functions from data via Christoffel polynomials. The code for our experiments is available at this https URL.

Quantifying The Limits of AI Reasoning: Systematic Neural Network Representations of Algorithms

A main open question in contemporary AI research is quantifying the forms of reasoning neural networks can perform when perfectly trained. This paper answers this by interpreting reasoning tasks as circuit emulation, where the gates define the type of reasoning; e.g. Boolean gates for predicate logic, tropical circuits for dynamic programming, arithmetic and analytic gates for symbolic mathematical representation, and hybrids thereof for deeper reasoning; e.g. higher-order logic.
We present a systematic meta-algorithm that converts essentially any circuit into a feedforward neural network (NN) with ReLU activations by iteratively replacing each gate with a canonical ReLU MLP emulator. We show that, on any digital computer, our construction emulates the circuit exactly--no approximation, no rounding, modular overflow included--demonstrating that no reasoning task lies beyond the reach of neural networks. The number of neurons in the resulting network (parametric complexity) scales with the circuit's complexity, and the network's computational graph (structure) mirrors that of the emulated circuit. This formalizes the folklore that NNs networks trade algorithmic run-time (circuit runtime) for space complexity (number of neurons).
We derive a range of applications of our main result, from emulating shortest-path algorithms on graphs with cubic--size NNs, to simulating stopped Turing machines with roughly quadratically--large NNs, and even the emulation of randomized Boolean circuits. Lastly, we demonstrate that our result is strictly more powerful than a classical universal approximation theorem: any universal function approximator can be encoded as a circuit and directly emulated by a NN.

Network connectivity analysis via shortest paths

Comments:
17 pages, 4 figures

Complex systems of interacting components often can be modeled by a simple graph $\mathcal{G}$ that consists of a set of $n$ nodes and a set of $m$ edges. Such a graph can be represented by an adjacency matrix $A\in\R^{n\times n}$, whose $(ij)$th entry is one if there is an edge pointing from node $i$ to node $j$, and is zero otherwise. The matrix $A$ and its positive integer powers reveal important properties of the graph and allow the construction of the path length matrix $L$ for the graph. The $(ij)$th entry of $L$ is the length of the shortest path from node $i$ to node $j$; if there is no path between these nodes, then the value of the entry is set to $\infty$. We are interested in how well information flows via shortest paths of the graph. This can be studied with the aid of the path length matrix. The path length matrix allows the definition of several measures of communication in the network defined by the graph such as the global $K$-efficiency, which considers shortest paths that are made up of at most $K$ edges for some $K<n$, as well as the number of such shortest paths. Novel notions of connectivity introduced in this paper help us understand the importance of specific edges for the flow of information through the graph. This is of interest when seeking to simplify a network by removing selected edges or trying to assess the sensitivity of the flow of information to changes due to exterior causes such as a traffic stoppage on a road network.

Minimax optimal transfer learning for high-dimensional additive regression

This paper studies high-dimensional additive regression under the transfer learning framework, where one observes samples from a target population together with auxiliary samples from different but potentially related regression models. We first introduce a target-only estimation procedure based on the smooth backfitting estimator with local linear smoothing. In contrast to previous work, we establish general error bounds under sub-Weibull($\alpha$) noise, thereby accommodating heavy-tailed error distributions. In the sub-exponential case ($\alpha=1$), we show that the estimator attains the minimax lower bound under regularity conditions, which requires a substantial departure from existing proof strategies. We then develop a novel two-stage estimation method within a transfer learning framework, and provide theoretical guarantees at both the population and empirical levels. Error bounds are derived for each stage under general tail conditions, and we further demonstrate that the minimax optimal rate is achieved when the auxiliary and target distributions are sufficiently close. All theoretical results are supported by simulation studies and real data analysis.

Agentic DDQN-Based Scheduling for Licensed and Unlicensed Band Allocation in Sidelink Networks

In this paper, we present an agentic double deep Q-network (DDQN) scheduler for licensed/unlicensed band allocation in New Radio (NR) sidelink (SL) networks. Beyond conventional reward-seeking reinforcement learning (RL), the agent perceives and reasons over a multi-dimensional context that jointly captures queueing delay, link quality, coexistence intensity, and switching stability. A capacity-aware, quality of service (QoS)-constrained reward aligns the agent with goal-oriented scheduling rather than static thresholding. Under constrained licensed bandwidth, the proposed design reduces blocking by up to 87.5% versus threshold policies while preserving throughput, highlighting the value of context-driven decisions in coexistence-limited NR SL systems.

Efficient Defection: Overage-Proportional Rationing Attains the Cooperative Frontier

Subjects:

We study a noncooperative $n$-player game of slack allocation in which each player $j$ has entitlement $L_j>0$ and chooses a claim $C_j\ge0$. Let $v_j=(C_j-L_j)_+$ (overage) and $s_j=(L_j-C_j)_+$ (slack); set $X=\sum_j v_j$ and $I=\sum_j s_j$. At the end of the period an overage-proportional clearing rule allocates cooperative surplus $I$ to defectors in proportion to $v_j$; cooperators receive $C_j$. We show: (i) the selfish outcome reproduces the cooperative payoff vector $(L_1,\dots,L_n)$; (ii) with bounded actions, defection is a weakly dominant strategy; (iii) within the $\alpha$-power family, the linear rule ($\alpha=1$) is the unique boundary-continuous member; and (iv) the dominant-strategy outcome is Strong Nash under transferable utility and hence coalition-proof (Bernheim et al., 1987). We give a policy interpretation for carbon rationing with a penalty collar.

Vendi Information Gain for Active Learning and its Application to Ecology
Quan Nguyen, Adji Bousso Dieng
Subjects:
Machine Learning (cs.LG); Information Theory (cs.IT); Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE)
While monitoring biodiversity through camera traps has become an important endeavor for ecological research, identifying species in the captured image data remains a major bottleneck due to limited labeling resources. Active learning -- a machine learning paradigm that selects the most informative data to label and train a predictive model -- offers a promising solution, but typically focuses on uncertainty in the individual predictions without considering uncertainty across the entire dataset. We introduce a new active learning policy, Vendi information gain (VIG), that selects images based on their impact on dataset-wide prediction uncertainty, capturing both informativeness and diversity. We applied VIG to the Snapshot Serengeti dataset and compared it against common active learning methods. VIG needs only 3% of the available data to reach 75% accuracy, a level that baselines require more than 10% of the data to achieve. With 10% of the data, VIG attains 88% predictive accuracy, 12% higher than the best of the baselines. This improvement in performance is consistent across metrics and batch sizes, and we show that VIG also collects more diverse data in the feature space. VIG has broad applicability beyond ecology, and our results highlight its value for biodiversity monitoring in data-limited environments.

Subjects:
Classical Physics (physics.class-ph); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
This paper examines the intuitive meaning of the Saint--Venant compatibility equation known from the linear theory of deformations. The linearized theory is typically obtained from the relations of finite deformation theory by neglecting higher-order terms. We show how to formulate the compatibility conditions for finite deformations and how the well-known equation for small deformations follows from this formulation.

Topological Big Bangs: Reflection, Itty-Bitty Blenders, and Eternal Trumpets
Hubert Bray, James Wheeler
Comments:
16 pages, 6 figures
Subjects:
General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
We discuss and formalize a topological means by which the initial singularity might be mollified, at the level of the spacetime manifold's structure, in classical cosmological models of a homogeneous expanding universe. The construction, dubbed a "reflective" topological big bang, generalizes Schrodinger's elliptic de Sitter space and is built to be compatible with the standard Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) picture of the large-scale universe, only minimally modifying it via some nontrivial topology at an earliest "moment" in the universe's history. We establish a mathematical characterization of the admissible topological structures of reflective topological big bangs, and we discuss implications for a standard concern in cosmology, the horizon problem. We present a nonreflective example that we've christened the Itty-Bitty Blender spacetime: this spacetime and its universal cover, the Eternal Trumpet spacetime, exhibit interesting potential structures of spacetimes avoiding the Hawking and Penrose singularity theorems.
