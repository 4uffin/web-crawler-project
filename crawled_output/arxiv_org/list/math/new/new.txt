Title:
Zeroes of Eigenfunctions of Schrödinger Operators after Schwartzman
Willie Wai-Yeung Wong
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
Consider a complete, connected, smooth, oriented Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ with boundary, such that the first Betti number vanishes. Sol Schwartzman proved that for Schrödinger operators of the form $-\Delta_g + V$ where $\Im(V)$ is signed, if $f: M\to\mathbb{C}$ is a non-vanishing element of its kernel, then $f$ has constant phase. The proof relied on dynamical systems methods applied to the gradient flow of the phase of $f$. In this manuscript we provide a more direct PDE argument that proves strengthened versions of the same facts.

A New Primes-Generating Sequence
Mohammed Bouras
Comments:
5 pages
Subjects:
General Mathematics (math.GM)
For the sequence defined by \[ a(n) = \frac{n^2 - n - 1}{\gcd\big(n^2 - n - 1,\, b(n-3) + n\,b(n-4)\big)} \] Where $b(n) = (n+2)\big(b(n-1) - b(n-2)\big),$ with initial conditions $b(-1) = 0$ and $b(0) = 1$, we find that $a(n)$ contains only $1$'s and primes, and can be represented as a finite continued fraction. It is more efficient for generating prime numbers than the Rowland sequence.

Title:
Index theory for non-compact quantum graphs
Daniele Garrisi, Alessandro Portaluri, Li Wu
Comments:
35 pages, 3 figures
Subjects:
Functional Analysis (math.FA); Classical Analysis and ODEs (math.CA); Dynamical Systems (math.DS); Symplectic Geometry (math.SG); Spectral Theory (math.SP)
We develop an index theory for variational problems on noncompact quantum graphs. The main results are a spectral flow formula, relating the net change of eigenvalues to the Maslov index of boundary data, and a Morse index theorem, equating the negative directions of the Lagrangian action with the total multiplicity of conjugate instants along the edges.
These results extend classical tools in global analysis and symplectic geometry to graph based models, with applications to nonlinear wave equations such as the nonlinear Schroedinger equation. The spectral flow formula is proved by constructing a Lagrangian intersection theory in the Gelfand-Robbin quotients of the second variation of the action. This approach also recovers, in a unified way, the known formulas for heteroclinic, halfclinic, homoclinic, and bounded orbits of (non)autonomous Lagrangian systems.

General Mathematics (math.GM)
In the note, the authors give a unified proof of Identities~67, 84, and~85 in the monograph "M. Z. Spivey, The Art of Proving Binomial Identities, Discrete Mathematics and its Applications, CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL, 2019; available online at this https URL and connect these three identities with a computing formula for the Stirling numbers of the second kind. Moreover, in terms of the notion of Qi's normalized remainders of the exponential and logarithmic functions, the authors reformulate the definitions of the Stirling numbers of the first and second kind and their generalizations by Howard in 1967 and 1980, Carlitz in 1980, and Broder in 1984.

Subjects:
Number Theory (math.NT)
In this paper, we investigate large values of Dirichlet polynomials with multiplicative coefficients $\sum_{n\le N}f(n)n^{it}$, where $1\ll t\le T$ for large $T$. We prove an improved Omega result in the region $\exp((\log T)^{\frac12+\varepsilon})\le N\le\sqrt T$, where $T$ is large. We also show an Omega result when $\log N$ is around $\sqrt{\log T\log_2T}$.

Local uniqueness and non-degeneracy of blowup solutions for regular Liouville systems
Zetao Cheng, Haoyu Li, Lei Zhang
Comments:
53 pages, one figure
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
We study the following Liouville system defined on a compact Riemann surface $M$, \begin{equation}
-\Delta u_i=\sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij}\rho_j\Big(\frac{h_j e^{u_j}}{\int_\Omega h_j e^{u_j}}-1\Big)\mbox{ in }M\mbox{ for }i=1,\cdots,n,\nonumber \end{equation} where the coefficient matrix $A=(a_{ij})_{n\times n}$ is nonnegative, $h_1, \ldots, h_n$ are positive smooth functions, and $\rho_1, \ldots, \rho_n$ are positive constants. For the blowup solutions, we establish their uniqueness and non-degeneracy based on natural assumptions. The main results significantly generalize corresponding results for single Liouville equations \cite{BartJevLeeYang2019,BartYangZhang20241,BartYangZhang20242}. To overcome several substantial difficulties, we develop certain tools and extend them into a more general framework applicable to similar situations. Notably, to address the considerable challenge of a continuum of standard bubbles, we refine the techniques from Huang-Zhang \cite{HuangZhang2022} and Zhang \cite{Zhang2006,Zhang2009} to achieve extremely precise pointwise estimates. Additionally, to address the limited information provided by the Pohozaev identity, we develop a useful Fredholm theory to discern the exact role that the Pohozaev identity plays for systems. The considerable difference between systems and a single equation is also reflected in the location of blowup points, where the uncertainty of the energy type of the blowup point makes it difficult to determine the sufficiency of pointwise estimates. In this regard, we extend our highly precise pointwise estimates to any finite order. This aspect is drastically distinct from analyses of single equations.

Title:
Embeddings into highly transitive and mixed identity free groups
James Hyde, Yash Lodha
Subjects:
Group Theory (math.GR)
Given a countable group $G$, we develop a method to construct an overgroup $H$ that is finitely generated, highly transitive and mixed identity free. Our construction can be controlled to ensure that some fundamental group theoretic properties of $G$ are inherited by $H$, such as amenability or the property of not containing a nonabelian free group. The former provides a strong solution to a question of Hull and Osin, and the latter provides the first examples of nonamenable groups without free subgroups that are highly transitive and mixed identity free. Our examples also have a nontrivial amenable radical, answering a question of Arzhantseva.

Title:
Sparse Polyak: an adaptive step size rule for high-dimensional M-estimation
Tianqi Qiao, Marie Maros
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC); Machine Learning (cs.LG); Machine Learning (stat.ML)
We propose and study Sparse Polyak, a variant of Polyak's adaptive step size, designed to solve high-dimensional statistical estimation problems where the problem dimension is allowed to grow much faster than the sample size. In such settings, the standard Polyak step size performs poorly, requiring an increasing number of iterations to achieve optimal statistical precision-even when, the problem remains well conditioned and/or the achievable precision itself does not degrade with problem size. We trace this limitation to a mismatch in how smoothness is measured: in high dimensions, it is no longer effective to estimate the Lipschitz smoothness constant. Instead, it is more appropriate to estimate the smoothness restricted to specific directions relevant to the problem (restricted Lipschitz smoothness constant). Sparse Polyak overcomes this issue by modifying the step size to estimate the restricted Lipschitz smoothness constant. We support our approach with both theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, demonstrating its improved performance.

Title:
Quantitative Linear Stability Analysis of Elliptic Relative Equilibria in the Planar N-Body Problem
Xijun Hu, Yuwei Ou, Jiexin Sun
Subjects:
Dynamical Systems (math.DS)
An elliptic relative equilibrium (ERE) is a special solution of the planar $N$-body problem generated by a central configuration. Its linear stability depends on the eccentricity $e$ and the masses of the bodies. However, for $e>0$, the variational equations become non-autonomous and highly complex, particularly near $e=1$, where the system exhibits a singularity. This complicates the stability analysis as $e$ approaches one, making it challenging to derive a rigorous quantitative estimate for the stable region across $e\in[0,1)$. In this work, we address this problem. Using trace formulas for the non-degenerate Hamiltonian system of EREs, we establish an upper bound ensuring non-degeneracy for all $e\in[0,1)$. As key applications, we provide explicit stability estimates for the Lagrange, Euler, and regular $(1+n)$-gon EREs over the full range of eccentricity.

Title:
Asymptotics of Jack measures with homogeneous specializations
Evgeni Dimitrov, Xiaohan Gao, Andy Gu, Ryan Niedernhofer
Comments:
45 pages
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
We consider Jack measures on partitions with homogeneous defining specializations. For each of the six distinct classes of measures obtained this way we prove a global law of large numbers with an explicit limiting particle density. We also demonstrate for one of these classes how to obtain a global central limit theorem, global and edge large deviation principles, and edge universality using the results of the paper. Our argument is based on explicitly evaluating Jack symmetric functions at homogeneous specializations, relating the Jack measures to the discrete $\beta$-ensembles from (Publications math{\' e}matiques de l'IH{\' E}S 125, 1-78, 2017) and using the discrete loop equations to substantially reduce computations.

Title:
Solution of Stochastic Facility Location Problems with Combinatorially many Decision-Dependent Distributions
Giovanni Pantuso
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
This article describes a model and an exact solution method for facility location problems with decision-dependent uncertainties. The model allows characterizing the probability distribution of the random elements as a function of the choice of open facilities. This, in turn, generates a combinatorial number of potential distributions of the random elements. Though general in the relationship between location decisions and distributions, the proposed model is, however, exponential in size. We show that the problem can be solved efficiently by a recent finitely convergent method for stochastic programs with decision-dependent uncertainty, for which we tight prove cutting planes and efficient valid inequalities. Extensive tests show that facility location problems with up to $2^{17}$ potential distributions and hundreds of thousand scenarios are solved within minutes. These results indentify a promising solution strategy for other combinatorial optimization problems characterized by decision-dependent uncertanty.

Strong and weak solutions to a structural acoustic model with a $C^1$ source term on the plate
Andrew R. Becklin (Drake University), Yanqiu Guo (Florida International University)
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
In this manuscript, we consider a structural acoustic model consisting of a wave equation defined in a bounded domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^3$, strongly coupled with a Berger plate equation acting on the flat portion of the boundary of $\Omega$. The system is influenced by an arbitrary $C^1$ nonlinear source term in the plate equation. Using nonlinear semigroup theory and monotone operator theory, we establish the well-posedness of both local strong and weak solutions, along with conditions for global existence. With additional assumptions on the source term, we examine the Nehari manifold and establish the global existence of potential well solutions. Our primary objective is to characterize regimes in which the system remains globally well-posed despite arbitrary growth of the source term and the absence of damping mechanisms to stabilize the dynamics.

Counting Homogeneous Einstein Metrics
Renato G. Bettiol, Hannah Friedman
Comments:
LaTeX2e, 29 pages, 1 figure, 7 tables
Subjects:
Differential Geometry (math.DG); Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Combinatorics (math.CO)
We present an explicit upper bound on the number of isolated homogeneous Einstein metrics on compact homogeneous spaces whose isotropy representations consist of pairwise inequivalent irreducibles. This is the BKK bound of the corresponding system of Laurent polynomials and is found combinatorially by computing the volume of a polytope. Inspired by a connection with algebraic statistics, we describe this system's BKK discriminant in terms of the principal $A$-determinant of scalar curvature. As a consequence, we confirm the Finiteness Conjecture of Böhm--Wang--Ziller in special cases. In particular, we give a unified proof that it holds on all generalized Wallach spaces. Finally, using numerical algebraic geometry, we compute $G$-invariant Einstein metrics on low-dimensional full flag manifolds $G/T$, where $G$ is a compact simple Lie group and $T$ is a maximal torus.

On the edge expansion of random polytopes
Asaf Ferber, Michael Krivelevich, Marcelo Sales, Wojciech Samotij
Comments:
16 pages, 4 figures
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO); Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM)
A $0/1$-polytope in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is the convex hull of a subset of $\{0,1\}^n$. The graph of a polytope $P$ is the graph whose vertices are the zero-dimensional faces of $P$ and whose edges are the one-dimensional faces of $P$. A conjecture of Mihail and Vazirani states that the edge expansion of the graph of every $0/1$-polytope is at least one. We study a random version of the problem, where the polytope is generated by selecting vertices of $\{0,1\}^n$ independently at random with probability $p\in (0,1)$. Improving earlier results, we show that, for any $p\in (0,1)$, with high probability the edge expansion of the random $0/1$-polytope is bounded from below by an absolute constant.

Three more proofs of two congruences for Merca's partition function
Fabrizio Zanello
Comments:
3 pages
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO); Commutative Algebra (math.AC); Number Theory (math.NT)
In this note, we provide three new, very short proofs of two interesting congruences for Merca's partition function $a(n)$, which enumerates integer partitions where the odd parts have multiplicity at most 2. These modulo 2 congruences were first shown elementarily by Sellers. We then frame $a(n)$ into the much broader context of eta-quotients, and suggest how to comprehensively describe its parity behavior. In particular, extensive computations suggest that $a(n)$ is odd precisely 25\% of the time.

Title:
A risk-sensitive ergodic singular stochastic control problem
Justin Gwee, Mihail Zervos
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC); Probability (math.PR)
We consider a two-sided singular stochastic control problem with a risk-sensitive ergodic criterion. In particular, we consider a stochastic system whose uncontrolled dynamics are modelled by a linear diffusion. The control that can be applied to the system is modelled by an additive finite variation process. The objective of the control problem is to minimise a risk-sensitive long-term average criterion that penalises deviations of the controlled process from a given interval, as well as the expenditure of control effort. The stochastic control problem has been partly motivated by the problem faced by a central bank who wish to control the exchange rate between its domestic currency and a foreign currency so that this fluctuates within a suitable target zone. We derive the complete solution to the problem under general assumptions by deriving a C2 solution to its HJB equation. To this end, we use the solutions to a suitable family of Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue problems.

On Dold condition and fail factor of linear recurrent sequences
Mateusz Rajs
Comments:

Subjects:
Number Theory (math.NT)
A sequence $\mathbf{A}$ is said to be realizable if satisfies so called sign and Dold conditions. We will say that a sequence almost satisfies the Dold condition if there exists a constant $c\in\mathbb{N}_+$ such that $(cA_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}_+}$ satisfies the Dold condition. In this paper we give characterisation of sequences defined by linear recursion of any order that almost satisfy the Dold condition. We also give an upper bound on the value of $c$.

On some algebraic and analytic properties of the finitely generated simple left orderable groups $G_ρ$
Pawel Aleksander Fedorynski, Yash Lodha
Subjects:
Group Theory (math.GR)
In $2019$ Hyde and the second author constructed the first family of finitely generated, simple, left orderable groups. We prove that these groups are not finitely presentable, non-inner amenable, don't have Kazhdan's property $(T)$ (yet have property FA), and that their first $l^2$-Betti number vanishes. We also show that these groups are uniformly simple, providing examples of uniformly simple finitely generated left orderable groups. Finally, we also describe the structure of the groups $G_{\rho}$ where $\rho$ is a periodic labeling.

The high-order Hermite discrete correction function method for surface-driven electromagnetic problems
Yann-Meing Law
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
The Hermite-Taylor method evolves all the variables and their derivatives through order $m$ in time to achieve a $2m+1$ order rate of convergence. The data required at each node of the staggered Cartesian meshes used by this method makes the enforcement of boundary and interface conditions challenging. In this work, we propose a novel correction function method, referred to as the discrete correction function method, which provides all the data required by the Hermite method near the surface where a condition is enforced. The flexibility of the resulting Hermite-Taylor discrete correction function method is demonstrated by considering a wide range of problems, including those with variable coefficients, discontinuous solutions at the interface, and generalized sheet transition conditions. Although the focus of this work is on Maxwell's equations, this high-order method can be adapted to other linear wave systems. Several numerical examples in two space dimensions are performed to verify the properties of the proposed method, including long-time simulations.

Motivic classes of stacks in finite characteristic and applications to stacks of Higgs bundles
Ruoxi Li
Subjects:
Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)
We define a ring of motivic classes of stacks suitable for symmetric powers in finite characteristic. Let $X$ be a smooth projective curve over a field of arbitrary characteristic. We calculate the motivic classes of the moduli stacks of semistable Higgs bundles on $X$. This recovers results of Fedorov, A. Soibelman and Y. Soibelman in characteristic zero, as well as those of Mozgovoy and Schiffmann for finite fields. We also obtain a simpler formula for the motivic classes of Higgs bundles in the universal $\lambda$-ring quotient using Mellit's results.

On the fully analytical cumulative distribution of product of correlated Gaussian random Variables with zero means
Erdinc Akyildirim, Alper Hekimoglu
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
We derive a fully analytical, one-line closed-form expression for the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the product of two correlated zero-mean normal random variables, avoiding any series representation. This result complements the well-known compact density formula with an equally compact and computationally practical CDF representation. Our main formula expresses the CDF in terms of Humbert's confluent hypergeometric function $\Phi_1$ and modified Bessel functions $K_\nu$, offering both theoretical elegance and computational efficiency. High-precision numerical experiments confirm pointwise agreement with Monte Carlo simulations and other benchmarks to machine accuracy. The resulting representation provides a tractable tool for applications in wireless fading channel modeling, nonlinear signal processing, statistics, finance, and applied probability.

Homogenization of rate-independent elastoplastic spring network models with non-local random fields
Simone Hermann
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
We investigate the time-evolution of elastoplastic materials reinforced by randomly distributed long-range interactions. Starting from a rate-independent system on a discrete spring lattice that combines local linearized elasticity, gradient-regularized plasticity and stochastic non-local links modeling stiff fibers, we establish a discrete-to-continuum limit in the energetic formulation. We prove that as the lattice spacing tends to zero, an evolutionary solution of the discrete system converges to the unique energetic solution of a continuum limit problem. The limiting continuum model couples classical elastoplasticity with a non-local energy featuring fractional-order interactions that capture the homogenized influence of random long-range reinforcements. These results extend previous static homogenization studies by rigorously treating path-dependent dissipation and showing existence, uniqueness and Lipschitz continuity of the evolving solutions. The work therefore provides a mathematical foundation for simulating time-dependent mechanical response of fiber-reinforced composites with random architecture.

On a finite-volume hyperbolic $3$-manifold, we establish an upper bound on the area of closed embedded surfaces with constant mean curvature at least one, depending on the mean curvature and the genus bounds. This area bound implies compactness for such surfaces. In particular, for Bryant surfaces with constant mean curvature equal to one, the area is bounded proportionally to the genus.

Induced structures of averaging commutative and cocommutative infinitesimal bialgebras via a new splitting of perm algebras
Chengming Bai, Li Guo, Guilai Liu, Quan Zhao

Subjects:
Rings and Algebras (math.RA); Quantum Algebra (math.QA); Representation Theory (math.RT)
It is well-known that an averaging operator on a commutative associative algebra gives rise to a perm algebra. This paper lifts this process to the level of bialgebras. For this purpose, we first give an infinitesimal bialgebra structure for averaging commutative associative algebras and characterize it by double constructions of averaging Frobenius commutative algebras. To find the bialgebra counterpart of perm algebras that is induced by such averaging bialgebras, we need a new two-part splitting of the multiplication in a perm algebra, which differs from the usual splitting of the perm algebra (into the pre-perm algebra) by the characterized representation. This gives rise to the notion of an averaging-pre-perm algebra, or simply an apre-perm algebra. Furthermore, the notion of special apre-perm algebras which are apre-perm algebras with the second multiplications being commutative is introduced as the underlying algebra structure of perm algebras with nondegenerate symmetric left-invariant bilinear forms. The latter are also the induced structures of symmetric Frobenius commutative algebras with averaging operators. Consequently, a double construction of averaging Frobenius commutative algebra gives rise to a Manin triple of special apre-perm algebras. In terms of bialgebra structures, this means that an averaging commutative and cocommutative infinitesimal bialgebra gives rise to a special apre-perm bialgebra.

Hickman and Wright proved an $L^2$ restriction estimate for the parabola $\Sigma$ in $\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}$ of the form
$$\left(\frac{1}{|\Sigma|}\sum\limits_{m\in\Sigma}|\widehat{f}(m)|^2 \right)^{\frac{1}{2}}\leq C_\epsilon N^\epsilon\cdot N^{-1}\left(\sum\limits_{x\in (\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z})^2}|f(x)|^\frac{6}{5}\right)^\frac{5}{6}$$
for all functions $f:(\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z})^2\rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ and any $\epsilon>0$, and that this bound is sharp when $N$ has a large square factor, and especially for $N = p^2$ for $p$ a prime. In contrast, Mockenhaupt and Tao proved in the special case $N = p$ the stronger estimate
$$\left(\frac{1}{|\Sigma|}\sum\limits_{m\in\Sigma}|\widehat{f}(m)|^2 \right)^{\frac{1}{2}}\leq C N^{-1}\left(\sum\limits_{x\in (\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z})^2}|f(x)|^\frac{4}{3}\right)^\frac{3}{4}.$$
We extend the Mockenhaupt-Tao bound to the case of squarefree $N$, proving
$$\left(\frac{1}{|\Sigma|}\sum\limits_{m\in\Sigma}|\widehat{f}(m)|^2 \right)^{\frac{1}{2}}\leq C_\epsilon N^\epsilon\cdot N^{-1}\left(\sum\limits_{x\in (\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z})^2}|f(x)|^\frac{4}{3}\right)^\frac{3}{4},$$

The 3D index and Dehn filling

Subjects:
Geometric Topology (math.GT); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Number Theory (math.NT)
We provide a rigorous proof of the Gang-Yonekura formula describing the transformation of the 3D index under Dehn filling a cusp in an orientable 3-manifold. The 3D index, originally introduced by Dimofte, Gaiotto and Gukov, is a physically inspired q-series that encodes deep topological and geometric information about cusped 3-manifolds. Building on the interpretation of the 3D index as a generating function over Q-normal surfaces, we introduce a relative version of the index for ideal triangulations with exposed boundary. This notion allows us to formulate a relative Gang-Yonekura formula, which we prove by developing a gluing principle for relative indices and establishing an inductive framework in the case of layered solid tori. Our approach makes use of Garoufalidis-Kashaev's meromorphic extension of the index, along with new identities involving q-hypergeometric functions. As an application, we study the limiting behaviour of the index for large fillings. We also develop code to perform certified computations of the index, guaranteeing correctness up to a specified accuracy. Our extensive computations support the topological invariance of the 3D index and suggest a well-defined extension to closed manifolds.

Data-driven approximation of transfer operators for mean-field stochastic differential equations
Eirini Ioannou, Stefan Klus, Gonçalo dos Reis
Subjects:
Dynamical Systems (math.DS); Numerical Analysis (math.NA); Probability (math.PR); Machine Learning (stat.ML)
Mean-field stochastic differential equations, also called McKean--Vlasov equations, are the limiting equations of interacting particle systems with fully symmetric interaction potential. Such systems play an important role in a variety of fields ranging from biology and physics to sociology and economics. Global information about the behavior of complex dynamical systems can be obtained by analyzing the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of associated transfer operators such as the Perron--Frobenius operator and the Koopman operator. In this paper, we extend transfer operator theory to McKean--Vlasov equations and show how extended dynamic mode decomposition and the Galerkin projection methodology can be used to compute finite-dimensional approximations of these operators, which allows us to compute spectral properties and thus to identify slowly evolving spatiotemporal patterns or to detect metastable sets. The results will be illustrated with the aid of several guiding examples and benchmark problems including the Cormier model, the Kuramoto model, and a three-dimensional generalization of the Kuramoto model.

Tree-width of a graph excluding an apex-forest or a wheel as a minor
Chun-Hung Liu, Youngho Yoo
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
The Grid Minor Theorem states that for every planar graph $H$, there exists a smallest integer $f(H)$ such that every graph with tree-width at least $f(H)$ contains $H$ as a minor. The only known lower bounds on $f(H)$ beyond the trivial bound $f(H)\geq |V(H)|-1$ come from the maximum number of disjoint cycles in $H$. In this paper, we study $f(H)$ for planar graphs $H$ with no two disjoint cycles. We prove that $f(H)=|V(H)|-1$ for every apex-forest $H$. This result improves a bound of Leaf and Seymour and contains all known large graphs $H$ meeting the trivial lower bound to our knowledge. We also prove that $f(H)\leq \max\{\tfrac32|V(H)|-\tfrac92,|V(H)|-1\}$ for every wheel $H$.

We propose an efficient algorithm for tensor PCA based on counting a specific family of weighted hypergraphs. For the order-$p$ tensor PCA problem where $p \geq 3$ is a fixed integer, we show that when the signal-to-noise ratio is $\lambda n^{-\frac{p}{4}}$ where $\lambda=\Omega(1)$, our algorithm succeeds and runs in time $n^{C+o(1)}$ where $C=C(\lambda)$ is a constant depending on $\lambda$. This algorithm improves a poly-logarithmic factor compared to previous algorithms based on the Sum-of-Squares hierarchy \cite{HSS15} or based on the Kikuchi hierarchy in statistical physics \cite{WEM19}. Furthermore, our result shows a smooth tradeoff between the signal-to-noise ratio and the computational cost in this problem, thereby confirming a conjecture posed in \cite{KWB22}.

Title:
Further constructions of square integer relative Heffter arrays

Comments:
12 pages, 2 figures
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
A square integer relative Heffter array is an $n \times n$ array whose rows and columns sum to zero, each row and each column has exactly $k$ entries and either $x$ or $-x$ appears in the array for every $x \in \mathbb{Z}_{2nk+t}\setminus J$, where $J$ is a subgroup of size $t$. There are many open problems regarding the existence of these arrays. In this paper we construct two new infinite families of these arrays with the additional property that they are strippable. These constructions complete the existence theory for square integer relative Heffter arrays in the case where $k=3$ and $n$ is prime.

Exponential mixing of measures of maximal entropy for certain skew products

Dynamical Systems (math.DS)
We establish a relation between the continuity of the fiber entropy and the continuity of the fiber Lyapunov exponents for skew products with 2-dimensional fibers. This result extends the theorem for surfaces proved by Buzzi-Crovisier-Sarig. As a consequence, we are able to obtain classes of skew products that satisfies the strong positive recurrence (SPR) property, in particular it has finite number of measures of maximal entropy, all exponentially mixing with good statistical properties.

A streamline upwind/Petrov-Galerkin method for the magnetic advection-diffusion problem
Haochen Li, Yangfan Luo, Jindong Wang, Shuonan Wu
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
This paper presents the development and analysis of a streamline upwind/Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) method for the magnetic advection-diffusion problem. A key feature of the method is an SUPG-type stabilization term based on the residuals and weighted advection terms of the test function. By introducing a lifting operator to characterize the jumps of finite element functions across element interfaces, we define a discrete magnetic advection operator, which subsequently enables the formulation of the desired SUPG method. Under mild assumptions, we establish the stability of the scheme and derive optimal error estimates. Furthermore, by introducing a stabilization term that depends on the residual, we propose a nonlinear extension aimed at more effectively reducing numerical oscillations in sharp layers. Numerical examples in both two and three dimensions are provided to demonstrate the theoretical convergence and stabilization properties of the proposed method.

Let $f$ be a rational map with an infinitely-connected fixed parabolic Fatou domain $U$. We prove that there exists a rational map $g$ with a completely invariant parabolic Fatou domain $V$, such that $(f,U)$ and $(g,V)$ are conformally conjugate, and each non-singleton Julia component of $g$ is a Jordan curve which bounds a superattracting Fatou domain of $g$ containing at most one postcritical point. Furthermore, we show that if the Julia set of $f$ is a Cantor set, then the parabolic Fatou domain can be perturbed into an attracting one without affecting the topology of the Julia set.

Patterson-Sullivan construction of equilibrium states and weighted counting in nonpositive curvature
Weisheng Wu
Subjects:
Dynamical Systems (math.DS)
Consider the geodesic flow on a closed rank one manifold of nonpositive curvature. For certain Hölder continuous potential, there exists a unique equilibrium state by \cite{BCFT}. In this paper, we introduce the notions of core limit set, regular radial limit set and uniformly recurrent and regular vectors, and then construct a family of Patterson-Sullivan measures on the boundary at infinity in two separate settings. Then we give an explicit construction of the above unique equilibrium state using Patterson-Sullivan measures. This enables us to prove the Bernoulli property of the equilibrium states. Using the Patterson-Sullivan construction and mixing properties of equilibrium states, we count the number of free homotopy classes with weights in nonpositive curvature.

A sharp lower bound on the generalized 4-independence number
Jing Huang
Comments:

Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
For a graph $G$, a vertex subset $S$ is called a maximum generalized $k$-independent set if the induced subgraph $G[S]$ does not contain a $k$-tree as its subgraph, and the subset has maximum cardinality. The generalized $k$-independence number of $G$, denoted as $\alpha_k(G)$, is the number of vertices in a maximum generalized $k$-independent set of $G$. For a graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, $m$ edges, $c$ connected components, and $c_1$ induced cycles of length 1 modulo 3, Bock et al. [J. Graph Theory 103 (2023) 661-673] showed that $\alpha_3(G)\geq n-\frac{1}{3}(m+c+c_1)$ and identified the extremal graphs in which every two cycles are vertex-disjoint. Li and Zhou [Appl. Math. Comput. 484 (2025) 129018] proved that if $G$ is a tree with $n$ vertices, then $\alpha_4(G) \geq \frac{3}{4}n$. They also presented all the corresponding extremal trees. In this paper, for a general graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, it is proved that $\alpha_4(G)\geq \frac{3}{4}(n-\omega(G))$ by using a different approach, where $\omega(G)$ denotes the dimension of the cycle space of $G$. The graphs whose generalized $4$-independence number attains the lower bound are characterized completely. This represents a logical continuation of the work by Bock et al. and serves as a natural extension of the result by Li and Zhou.

Random Nonlinear Fusion Frames from Averaged Operator Iterations
James Tian
Subjects:
Functional Analysis (math.FA)
We study random iterations of averaged operators in Hilbert spaces and prove that the associated residuals converge exponentially fast, both in expectation and almost surely. Our results provide quantitative bounds in terms of a single geometric parameter, giving sharp control of convergence rates under minimal assumptions. As an application, we introduce the concept of random nonlinear fusion frames. Here the atoms are generated dynamically from the residuals of the iteration and yield exact synthesis with frame-like stability in expectation. We show that these frames achieve exponential sampling complexity and encompass important special cases such as random projections and randomized Kaczmarz methods. This reveals a link between stochastic operator theory, frame theory, and randomized algorithms, and establishes a structural tool for constructing nonlinear frame-like systems with strong stability and convergence guarantees.

We prove that for any fixed integer \( n \geq 3 \) and nonzero integer \( m \), the proportion of integral binary forms of degree \( n \) that represent \( m \) tends to zero as the height tends to infinity. In fact, almost all such forms fail to represent \( m \). Our method uses lattice point counting and geometric methods, including Davenport's lemma and estimates for volumes of hyperplane sections of cubes, together with an analysis of the distribution of rational points on such hyperplanes. The result also holds when restricted to irreducible forms.

This paper systematically develops a notion of regular sequences in the context of $R$-linear triangulated categories for a graded-commutative ring $R$. The notion has equivalent characterizations involving Koszul objects and local cohomology. The main examples are in the context of the Hochschild cohomology ring or the group cohomology ring acting on derived or stable categories. As applications, lengths of regular sequences provide lower bounds for level and Rouquier dimension.

This paper focuses on the fractal characteristics of the absolutely continuous spectral measure of the subcritical almost Mathieu operator (AMO) and Diophantine frequency. In particular, we give a complete description of the (classical) multifractal spectrum and a finer description in the logarithmic gauge. The proof combines continued$-$fraction$/$metric Diophantine techniques and refined covering arguments. These results rigorously substantiate (and quantify in a refined gauge) the physicists' intuition that the absolutely continuous component of the spectrum is dominated by energies with trivial scaling index, while also exhibiting nontrivial exceptional sets which are negligible for classical Hausdorff measure but large at the logarithmic scale.

Several new classes of optimal p-ary cyclic codes

Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT)
Cyclic codes, as a crucial subclass of linear codes, exhibit broad applications in communication systems, data storage systems, and consumer electronics, primarily attributed to their well-structured algebraic properties. Let $p$ denote an odd prime with $p\geq5$, and let $m$ be a positive integer. The primary objective of this paper is to construct three novel classes of optimal $p$-ary cyclic codes, denoted as ${\mathcal{C}_p}(0,s,t)$, which possess the parameters $[{p^m} - 1,{p^m} - 2m - 2,4]$. Here, $s$ is defined as $s = \frac{{{p^m}+1}}{2}$, and $t$ satisfies the condition $2 \le t \le {p^m} - 2$. Notably, one of the constructed classes includes certain known optimal quinary cyclic codes as special cases. Furthermore, for the specific case when $p=5$, this paper additionally presents four new classes of optimal cyclic codes ${\mathcal{C}_5}(0,s,t)$.

Analysis and Design of Spare Strategy for Large-Scale Satellite Constellation Using Markov Chain

Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
This paper presents a method for analyzing and designing an optimal spare-management policy in large-scale satellite constellations using a Markov chain model. To capture the stochastic nature of satellite failures and launch vehicle lead times, we adopt Markov chains to model both failure and replenishment processes. We reinvestigate an indirect spare strategy, modeled as a multi-echelon periodic-review reorder-point/order-quantity policy, in which spares are first delivered to parking orbits and then transferred to constellation planes. The stock levels in constellation and parking orbits are each modeled as independent Markov chains, and a fixed-point iteration yields a consistent joint stationary solution that describes the strategy's average behavior. This approach accurately captures the stochastic interplay within a multi-echelon model driven by orbital mechanics, avoiding the aggregation assumptions of prior works and remaining valid across a wider operating domain. Building on this fast, accurate analysis, we formulate an optimization problem and solve it via a genetic algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate the practical value of both the analysis method and the optimization framework in a real-world mega-constellation case study.

Let $X$ be a matrix of indeterminates, $t$ an integer, and $P_t(X)$ define the ideal generated by the permanents of all $t\times t$ submatrix of $X$. $P_t(X)$ is called a permanental ideal. In this article, we study the algebras $\Bbbk[X]/P_t(X)$ where $X$ is a generic, symmetric, or a Hankel matrix of indeterminates. When $\operatorname{char}\Bbbk = 2$, $P_t(X)$ is also known as a determinantal ideal, a popular class in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry, and thus many properties of $P_t(X)$ are known in this case. We prove that, if $X$ is an $n\times n$ matrix and $\operatorname{char} \Bbbk>2$, the algebra $\Bbbk[X]/P_n(X)$ is $F$-regular, just like when $\operatorname{char} \Bbbk = 2$. On the other hand, we obtain a full characterization of when $\Bbbk[X]/P_2(X)$ is $F$-pure or $F$-regular, when $\operatorname{char} \Bbbk >2$, and the answer is different than that in even characteristic.

Hopf formulae for cocommutative Hopf algebras

Comments:

Subjects:

The adjunction between coalgebras and Hopf algebras, first described by Takeuchi, allows one to prove that the semi-abelian category of cocommutative Hopf algebras has enough $\mathcal E$-projective objects with respect to the class $\mathcal{E}$ of cleft extensions. One then proves that, for any cocommutative Hopf algebra, there exists a weak $\mathcal{E}$-universal normal (=central) extension. This fact allows one to apply the methods of categorical Galois theory to classify normal $\mathcal{E}$-extensions and to provide an explicit description of the fundamental group of a cocommutative Hopf algebra in terms of a generalized Hopf formula. Moreover, with any cleft extension, we associate a 5-term exact sequence in homology that can be seen as a Hopf-theoretic analogue of the classical Stallings-Stammbach exact sequence in group theory.

We study families of spherical metrics on the flat torus $E_{\tau}$ $=$ $\mathbb{C}/\Lambda_{\tau}$ with blow-up behavior at prescribed conical singularities at $0$ and $\pm p$, where the cone angle at $0$ is $6\pi$, and at $\pm p$ is $4\pi$. We prove that the existence of such a necessarily unique, even family of spherical metrics is completely determined by the geometry of the torus: such a family exists if and only if\textbf{ }the Green function $G(z;\tau)$ admits a pair of nontrivial critical points $\pm a$. In this case, the cone point $p$ must equal $a$, and the corresponding monodromy data is $\left( 2r,2s\right) $, where $a=r+s\tau.$
An explicit transformation relating this family to the one with a single conical singularity of angle $6\pi$ at the origin is established in Theorem 1.4. A rigidity result for rhombic tori is proved in Theorem 1.5.

The game of cops and robber is a pursuit-evasion game played on graphs that has been extensively studied. Traditionally the game is played with one or more cops and only one robber, but in this paper we consider the game played with multiple robbers, with rules allowing for consecutive capture of the robbers. While the cop number remains the same, the capture time can differ drastically compared to the game played with one robber. In this paper we present general upper bounds for the capture time of cop-win graphs in the game with multiple robbers and show that they are the best possible for some families of graphs. Moreover, we explore how the capture time behaves with an increasing number of robbers and prove a surprising relation between this behavior and the 0-visibility cop number.

Recently, Schlosser and Zhou proposed many conjectures on sign patterns of the coefficients appearing in the $q$-series expansions of the infinite Borwein product and other infinite products raised to a real power. In this paper, we will study several of these conjectures. Let \[ G(q):=\prod_{i=1}^{I}\left(\prod_{k=0}^{\infty}(1-q^{m_{i}+kn_{i}})(1-q^{-m_{i}+(k+1)n_{i}})\right)^{u_{i}} \] where $I$ is a positive integer, $1\leq m_{i}<n_{i}$ and $u_{i}\neq0$ for $1\leq i\leq I$ and $|q|<1.$ We will establish an asymptotic formula for the coefficients of $G(q)^{\delta}$ with $\delta$ being a positive real number by using the Hardy--Ramanujan--Rademacher circle method. As applications, we apply the asymptotic formula to confirm some of the conjectures of Schlosser and Zhou.

In this paper, we study the probability that some weighted partial sums of a random multiplicative function $f$ are positive. Applying the characteristic decomposition, we obtain that if $S$ is a non-empty subset of the multiplicative residue class group $(\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z})^{\times}$ with $m$ being a fixed positive integer and $A=\{a+mn\mid n=0,1,2,3,\cdots\}$ with $a\in S,$ then there exists a positive number $\delta$ independent of $x$, such that \[ \mathbb{P}\left(\sum_{A\cap[1,x)}\frac{f(n)}{n}<0\right)>\delta \] unless the coefficients of the real characters in the expansion of the characteristic function of $S$ according to the characters of $(\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z})^{\times}$ are all non-negative, and the coefficients of the complex characters are all zero, in which case we have \[ \mathbb{P}\left(\sum_{A\cap[1,x)}\frac{f(n)}{n}<0\right)=O\left(\exp\left(-\exp\left(\frac{\ln x}{C\ln_{2}x}\right)\right)\right) \] for a positive constant $C.$ This includes as a special case a result of Angelo and Xu. We also extend the result to the cyclotomic field $K_{n}=\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_{n})$ with $\zeta_{n}=e^{2\pi i/n}$ and study the probability that these generalized weighted sums are positive. In addition, we deal with the positivity problem of certain partial sums related to the celebrated Ramanujan tau function $\tau(n)$ and the Ramanujan modular form $\Delta(q),$ and obtain an upper bound for the probability that these partial sums are negative in a more general situation.

A lower bound for the number of Egyptian fractions

Subjects:

An Egyptian fraction is a sum of the form $1/n_1 + \cdots + 1/n_r$ where $n_1, \dots, n_k$ are distinct positive integers. We prove explicit lower bounds for the cardinality of the set $E_N$ of rational numbers that can be represented by Egyptian fractions with denominators not exceeding $N$. More precisely, we show that for every integer $k \geq 4$ such that $\ln_k N \geq 3/2$ it holds $$ \frac{\ln(|E_N|)}{\ln 2} \geq \Big(2 - \frac{3}{\ln_k N}\Big)\frac{N}{\ln N}\prod_{j=3}^{k} \ln_j N , $$ where $\ln_k$ denotes the $k$-th iterate of the natural logarithm. This improves on a previous result of Bleicher and Erdős who established a similar bound but under the more stringent condition $\ln_k N\geq k$ and with a leading constant of $1$. Furthermore, we provide some methods to compute the exact values of $|E_N|$ for large positive integers $N$, and we give a table of $|E_N|$ for $N$ up to $154$.

The Solomon-Terao bi-polynomial was introduced by Solomon and Terao which degenerates to the characteristic polynomial of hyperplane arrangements. Also, it was proved recently that the other specialization of the Solomon-Terao bi-polynomial, we call the Solomon-Terao polynomial, coincides with the Poinraré polynomial of the regular nilpotent Hessenberg variety when the arrangement and the variety comes from the same lower ideal in the positive system. Moreover, there are recent developments with superspace coinvariants and Fields conjecture, thus these polynomials are becoming more and more important. However, the research of them has been very hard, and even the top degree of the Solomon-Terao polynomial has not yet been known, which we solve in this article, by using the Castelnouvo-Mumford regularity of the logarithmic derivation modules.

Semantic Rate-Distortion Theory with Applications

Information Theory (cs.IT); Signal Processing (eess.SP)
Artificial intelligence (AI) is ushering in a new era for communication. As a result, the establishment of a semantic communication framework is putting on the agenda. Based on a realistic semantic communication model, this paper develops a rate-distortion framework for semantic compression. Different from the existing works primarily focusing on decoder-side estimation of intrinsic meaning and ignoring its inherent issues, such as ambiguity and polysemy, we exploit a constraint of conditional semantic probability distortion to effectively capture the essential features of practical semantic exchanges in an AI-assisted communication system. With the help of the methods in rate-distortion-perception theory, we establish a theorem specifying the minimum achievable rate under this semantic constraint and a traditional symbolic constraint and obtain its closed-form limit for a particular semantic scenario. From the experiments in this paper, bounding conditional semantic probability distortion can effectively improve both semantic transmission accuracy and bit-rate efficiency. Our framework bridges information theory and AI, enabling potential applications in bandwidth-efficient semantic-aware networks, enhanced transceiver understanding, and optimized semantic transmission for AI-driven systems.

Perfectly transparent boundary conditions and wave propagation in lattice Boltzmann schemes
Thomas Bellotti (EM2C)
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA); Classical Analysis and ODEs (math.CA)
Systems of N = 1, 2, . . . first-order hyperbolic conservation laws feature N undamped waves propagating at finite speeds. On their own hand, multi-step Finite Difference and lattice Boltzmann schemes with q = N + 1, N + 2, . . . unknowns involve N ''physical'' waves, which are aimed at being as closely-looking as possible to the ones of the PDEs, and q-N ''numerical-spurious-parasitic'' waves, which are subject to their own speed of propagation, and either damped or undamped. The whole picture is even more complicated in the discrete setting-as numerical schemes act as dispersive media, thus propagate different harmonics at different phase (and group) velocities. For compelling practical reasons, simulations must always be conducted on bounded domains, even when the target problem is unbounded in space. The importance of transparent boundary conditions, preventing artificial boundaries from acting as mirrors producing polluting ricochets, naturally follows. This work presents, building on Besse, Coulombel, and Noble [ESAIM: M2AN, 55 (2021)], a systematic way of developing perfectly transparent boundary conditions for lattice Boltzmann schemes tackling linear problems in one and two space dimensions. Our boundary conditions are ''perfectly'' transparent, at least for 1D problems, as they absorb both physical and spurious waves regardless of their frequency. After presenting, in a simple framework, several approaches to handle the fact that q > N , we elect the so-called ''scalar'' approach (which despite its name, also works when N > 1) as method of choice for more involved problems. This method solely relies on computing the coefficients of the Laurent series at infinity of the roots of the dispersion relation of the bulk scheme. We insist on asymptotics for these coefficients in the spirit of analytic combinatorics. The reason is two-fold: asymptotics guide truncation of boundary conditions to make them depending on a fixed number of past time-steps, and make it clearduring the process of computing coefficients-whether intermediate quantities can be safely stored using floating-point arithmetic or not. Numerous numerical investigations in 1D and 2D with N = 1 and 2 are carried out, and show the effectiveness of the proposed boundary conditions.

Representation Theory (math.RT); Combinatorics (math.CO)
We construct an explicit field-independent SL$_2$-equivariant isomorphism between an invariant space of tensors and a plethysm space. The existence of such an isomorphism was only known in characteristic 0, and only indirectly via character theory. Our isomorphism naturally extends the web of field-independent isomorphisms given by Hermite reciprocity, Hodge duality, and the Wronskian isomorphism. This is a characteristic free generalization of a classical situation in characteristic zero: certain rectangular Kronecker coefficients coincide with certain plethysm coefficients, and their non-negativiy proves the unimodality of the $q$-binomial coefficient.
We also give a short combinatorial field-independent proof that the Hermite reciprocity map over the standard basis is a triangular matrix with 1s on the main diagonal.

We provide two robust examples of globally partially hyperbolic systems with a multi one-dimensional center splitting, for which all Gibbs u-states are hyperbolic and the number of physical measures is fixed. In the second example, the physical measures have different unstable indices, and the supports of those with index at least 2 can be adjusted to lie on a non-uniformly hyperbolic set using the techniques developed for the first example. Such partially hyperbolic systems were previously studied in \cite{MC25, Bur25}, where the existence and finiteness of physical measures were established under the assumption of hyperbolicity of the Gibbs $u$-states or the SRB measures, respectively.

The Bin Packing Problem with Setups: Formulation, Structural Properties and Computational Insights
Roberto Baldacci, Fabio Ciccarelli, Stefano Conglio, Valerio Dose, Fabio Furini
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
We introduce and study a novel generalization of the classical Bin Packing Problem (BPP), called the Bin Packing Problem with Setups (BPPS). In this problem, which has many practical applications in production planning and logistics, the items are partitioned into classes and, whenever an item from a given class is packed into a bin, a setup weight and cost are incurred. We present a natural Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation for the BPPS and analyze the structural properties of its Linear Programming relaxation. We show that the lower bound provided by the relaxation can be arbitrarily poor in the worst case. We introduce the Minimum Classes Inequalities (MCIs), which strengthen the relaxation and restore a worst-case performance guarantee of 1/2, matching that of the classical BPP. In addition, we derive the Minimum Bins Inequality (MBI) to further reinforce the relaxation, together with an upper bound on the number of bins in any optimal BPPS solution, which leads to a significant reduction in the number of variables and constraints of the ILP formulation. Finally, we establish a comprehensive benchmark of 480 BPPS instances and conduct extensive computational experiments. The results show that the integration of MCIs, the MBI, and the upper bound on the number of bins substantially improves the performance of the ILP formulation in terms of solution time and number of instances solved to optimality.

From the Klein-Gordon Equation to the Relativistic Quantum Hydrodynamic System: Local Well-posedness
Ben Duan, Jun Li, Bin Guo, Rongrong Yan
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
In the Klein-Gordon equation, the quantum and relativistic parameters are intricately coupled, which complicates the direct consideration of quantum fluctuations. In this paper, the so-called Relativistic Quantum Hydrodynamics System is derived from the Klein-Gordon equation with Poisson effects via the Madelung transformation, providing a fresh perspective for analyzing the singular limits, such as the semi-classical limits and non-relativistic limits. The Relativistic Quantum Hydrodynamics System, when the semiclassical limit is taken, formally reduces to the Relativistic Hydrodynamics System. When the relativistic limit is taken, it formally reduces to the Quantum Hydrodynamics System. Additionally, we establish the local classical solutions for the Cauchy problem associated with the Relativistic Quantum Hydrodynamic System. The initial density value is assumed to be a small perturbation of some constant state, but the other initial values do not require this restriction. The key point is that the Relativistic Quantum Hydrodynamic System is reformulated as a hyperbolic-elliptic coupled system.

A Spectral Localization Method for Time-Fractional Integro-Differential Equations with Nonsmooth Data
Lijing Zhao, Rui Zhao, Wenyi Tian, Yufeng Nie
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA); Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
In this work, we develop a localized numerical scheme with low regularity requirements for solving time-fractional integro-differential equations. First, a fully discrete numerical scheme is constructed. Specifically, for temporal discretization, we employ the contour integral method (CIM) with parameterized hyperbolic contours to approximate the nonlocal operators. For spatial discretization, the standard piecewise linear Galerkin finite element method (FEM) is used. We then provide a rigorous error analysis, demonstrating that the proposed scheme achieves high accuracy even for problems with nonsmooth/vanishing initial values or low-regularity solutions, featuring spectral accuracy in time and second-order convergence in space. Finally, a series of numerical experiments in both 1-D and 2-D validate the theoretical findings and confirm that the algorithm combines the advantages of spectral accuracy, low computational cost, and efficient memory usage.

Neural network-based singularity detection and applications

Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
We present a method for constructing a special type of shallow neural network that learns univariate meromorphic functions with pole-type singularities. Our method is based on using a finite set of Laurent coefficients as input information, which we compute by FFT, employing values of the investigated function on some contour $\Gamma$ in the complex plane. The primary components of our methodology are the following: (1) the adaptive construction of rational polynomial activation functions, (2) a novel backpropagation-free method for determining the weights and biases of the hidden layer, and (3) the computation of the weights and biases of the output layer through least-squares fitting. Breaking with the idea of "safe" rational activation functions, we introduce a rational activation function as a meromorphic function with a single pole situated within the domain of investigation. Employing the weights and biases of the hidden layer, we then scale and shift the pole of the activation function to find the estimated locations of the singularities; this implies that the number of neurons in the hidden layer is determined by the number of singularities of the function that is being approximated. While the weights and biases of the hidden layer are tuned so as to capture the singularities, the least-squares fitting for the computation of weights and biases of the output layer ensures approximation of the function in the rest of the domain. Through the use of Laurent-Padé rational approximation concepts, we prove locally uniform convergence of our method. We illustrate the effectiveness of our method through numerical experiments, including the construction of extensions of the time-dependent solutions of nonlinear autonomous PDEs into the complex plane, and study the dynamics of their singularities.

Resolving subcategories for gentle algebras II: Resolving subcategories for gentle trees
Benjamin Dequêne, Michaël Schoonheere
Subjects:
Representation Theory (math.RT); Combinatorics (math.CO)
This paper is the second part of a series that intends to study the resolving subcategories for gentle algebras over an algebraically closed field $\mathbb{K}$. As in the first part, we continue to focus on gentle quivers $(Q,R)$, where $Q$ is a directed tree, known as gentle trees. In our previous work, via a modified surface model for gentle algebras with finite global dimension, we studied the join-irreducible elements of the lattice of resolving subcategories of $\mathbb{K}Q/\langle R \rangle - \text{mod}$, which happen to be those generated by a non-projective indecomposable object. In this paper, we notice that this lattice is not semidistributive in general and, accordingly, introduce a so-called upper join-decomposition, replacing the canonical one. Together with the techniques we develop in our geometric model, it allows us to describe the resolving subcategories of any gentle tree. These same techniques let us explicitly construct the resolving subcategory generated by any collection of indecomposable $\mathbb{K}Q/\langle R\rangle$-modules.

We say that a formal deformation from an algebra $N$ to algebra $A$ is strongly flat if for every real number $e $ there is a real number $0<s<e$ such that this deformation specialised at $t=s$ gives an algebra isomorphic to $A$.
We show that every strongly flat deformation from a finite-dimensional $C$-algebra $N$ to a semisimple $C$-algebra $A$
specialised at $t=s$ for all sufficiently small real numbers $s>0$ gives an algebra isomorphic to $A$.
We also give a characterisation of semisimple algebras $A$ to which a given algebra $N$ cannot be deformed to. This gives a partial answer to a question of Michael Wemyss on Acons [14]. We also give a partial answer to question 6.5 from [1].

Analog Over-the-Air Federated Learning with Interference-Based Energy Harvesting

6 pages, accepted by Globecom 2025 workshop
Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT); Emerging Technologies (cs.ET)
We consider analog over-the-air federated learning, where devices harvest energy from in-band and out-band radio frequency signals, with the former also causing co-channel interference (CCI). To mitigate the aggregation error, we propose an effective denoising policy that does not require channel state information (CSI). We also propose an adaptive scheduling algorithm that dynamically adjusts the number of local training epochs based on available energy, enhancing device participation and learning performance while reducing energy consumption. Simulation results and convergence analysis confirm the robust performance of the algorithm compared to conventional methods. It is shown that the performance of the proposed denoising method is comparable to that of conventional CSI-based methods. It is observed that high-power CCI severely degrades the learning performance, which can be mitigated by increasing the number of active devices, achievable via the adaptive algorithm.

More birational involutions

Subjects:
Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)
For $S$ a very general polarized K3 surface of degree $8n-6$, we describe in geometrical terms a birational involution of the Hilbert scheme $S^{[n]}$ of $n$ points on the surface, whose existence was established from lattice theoretical considerations. In a previous work we studied this involution for $n=3$, with the help of the exceptional Lie group $G_2$, since the Mukai model of $S$ is embedded in its projectivized Lie algebra. Here we use different, more general arguments to show that some important features of the birational involution persist for $n\ge 4$. In particular, we describe the indeterminacy locus of the involution in terms of a Mori contraction, and deduce that it is birational to a $\mathbb{P}^2$-fibration over a moduli space of sheaves on $S$, that also admits a degree two nef and big line bundle and an induced birational involution.

The low-rank tensor-train finite difference method for three-dimensional parabolic equations
Gianmarco Manzini, Tommaso Sorgente
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
This paper presents a numerical framework for the low-rank approximation of the solution to three-dimensional parabolic problems. The key contribution of this work is the tensorization process based on a tensor-train reformulation of the second-order accurate finite difference method. We advance the solution in time by combining the finite difference method with an explicit and implicit Euler method and with the Crank-Nicolson method. We solve the linear system arising at each time step from the implicit and semi-implicit time-marching schemes through a matrix-free preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) method, appositely designed to exploit the separation of variables induced by the tensor-train format. We assess the performance of our method through extensive numerical experimentation, demonstrating that the tensor-train design offers a robust and highly efficient alternative to the traditional approach. Indeed, the usage of this type of representation leads to massive time and memory savings while guaranteeing almost identical accuracy with respect to the traditional one. These features make the method particularly suitable to tackle challenging high-dimensional problems.

We study the problem of determining when the blowup $X \to \mathbb{P}^3$ along a smooth space curve $C$ is a Mori Dream Space. We obtain sufficient conditions, as well obstructions to the Mori dreamness of $X$ based on the external geometry of $C$. We furthermore find infinitely many pairs $(g,d)$ such that the corresponding Hilbert schemes $H_{g,d}^S$ admit components whose general element has these obstructions. As a consequence we show that Mori dreamness is not an open property in flat families and exhibit various degenerational pathologies.

On the Linearization of Certain Singularities of Nijenhuis Operators

We consider a linearization problem for Nijenhuis operators in dimension two around a point of scalar type in analytic category. The problem was almost completely solved in arXiv:1903.06411. One case, however, namely the case of left-symmetric algebra $\mathfrak b_{1, \alpha}$, proved to be difficult. Here we solve it and, thus, complete the solution of the linearization problem for Nijenhuis operators in dimension two. The problem turns out to be related to classical results on the linearization of vector fields and their monodromy mappings.

On the threshold for triangulations inside convex polygons
Brett Kolesnik, Georgii Zakharov, Maksim Zhukovskii
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR); Combinatorics (math.CO)
Start with a large convex polygon and add all other edges inside independently with probability $p$. At what critical threshold $p_c$ do triangulations of the polygon begin to appear?
The first author and Gravner asked this question, and observed that $p_c=\Theta(1)$, using the relationship with the Catalan numbers and a coupling with oriented site percolation on ${\mathbb Z}^2$. More recently, Archer, Hartarsky, the first author, Olesker-Taylor, Schapira and Valesin proved that $1/4<p_c<p_c^o$, where $1/4$ is the Catalan exponential growth rate and $p_c^o$ is the critical threshold for oriented percolation. The upper bound is strict, but non-quantitative, and follows by a renormalization argument.
We show that $p_c<1/2$ using a simple ear clipping algorithm, which can be analyzed using the gambler's ruin problem. This bound is closer to the truth (perhaps near $0.4$) and shows that most configurations of edges inside large convex polygons contain triangulations.

The unified gas kinetic wave-particle method for the neutron transport equation

Subjects:

The unified gas-kinetic wave-particle (UGKWP) method is proposed for the neutron transport equation, addressing the inherent multiscale nature of neutron propagation in both optically thin and thick regimes. UGKWP couples macroscopic diffusion and microscopic transport processes within a unified time-dependent framework, allowing a smooth transition between the free transport and diffusion regimes. This method is readily extended to multi-group neutron transport models and is applicable to both steady-state and eigenvalue problems. Several numerical examples, including the 1D and 3D single-group and 3D multi-group problems, are studied, indicating UGKWP a promising framework for scalable and accurate simulation of multigroup neutron transport in complex geometries.

Convergence to equilibrium for fully discretizations of nonlocal Cahn-Hilliard equation
Danni Zhang, Dongling Wang
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
The study of long-term dynamics for numerical solutions of nonlinear evolution equations, particularly phase field models, has consistently garnered considerable attention. The Cahn-Hilliard (CH) equation is one of the most important phase field models and is widely applied in materials science. In order to more accurately describe the practical phenomena in material microstructural phase transitions, the Nonlocal Cahn-Hilliard (N-CH) equation incorporates a finite range of spatial nonlocal interactions is introduced, which is a generalization of the classic CH equation. However, compared to its classic counterpart, it is very challenging to investigate the long-term asymptotic behavior of solution to the N-CH equation due to the complexity of the nonlocal integral term and the lack of high-order diffusion term. In this paper, we consider first-order and second-order temporal discretization methods for the N-CH equation, respectively, while utilizing a second-order finite difference method for spatial approximation to construct the energy stable fully discrete numerical schemes. Based on energy stability and the Łojasiewicz inequality, we rigorously prove that the numerical solutions of these fully discrete numerical schemes converge to equilibrium as time goes to infinity.

New Approaches to the Fixed Point Property in L^1 Spaces
Faruk Alpay, Hamdi Alakkad
Comments:
10 pages
Subjects:
Functional Analysis (math.FA)
This paper presents new approaches to the fixed point property for nonexpansive mappings in L^1 spaces. While it is well-known that L^1 fails the fixed point property in general, we provide a complete and self-contained proof that measure-compactness of a convex set is a sufficient condition. Our exposition makes all compactness and uniform integrability arguments explicit, offering a clear path from measure-theoretic compactness to weak compactness, normal structure, and ultimately fixed points via Kirk's theorem.
Beyond this geometric approach, we contextualize this result within broader structural strategies for obtaining fixed points in L^1 and related spaces. We discuss the roles of ultraproducts, equivalent renormings that induce uniform convexity on l^1, and the fixed point property in non-reflexive spaces like Lorentz sequence spaces. This work unifies these perspectives, demonstrating that the obstruction to fixed points in L^1 is not the space itself but specific geometric or structural properties of its subsets. The results clarify the landscape of fixed point theory in non-reflexive Banach spaces.

We study the isoperimetric problem for capillary hypersurfaces with a general contact angle $\theta \in (0, \pi)$, outside arbitrary convex sets. We prove that the capillary energy of any surface supported on any such convex set is larger than that of a spherical cap with the same volume and the same contact angle on a flat support, and we characterize the equality cases. This provides a complete solution to the isoperimetric problem for capillary surfaces outside convex sets at arbitrary contact angles, generalizing the well-known Choe-Ghomi-Ritoré inequality, which corresponds to the case $\theta=\frac\pi2$.

A Categorical Approach to Finiteness Conditions
David Forsman
Comments:
24 pages, 35 diagrams
Subjects:
Category Theory (math.CT)
We introduce a general categorical framework for finiteness conditions that unifies classical notions such as Noetherianness, Artinianness, and various forms of topological compactness. This is achieved through the concept of \textbf{$\tau$-compactness}, defined relative to a \textbf{coverage} $\tau$. A coverage on a category $C$ is a specified class of covering diagrams, which are functors $F\colon I \to C/c$ of a specified variance, where the indexing category $I$ is equipped with a set of 'designated small objects'. An object $c$ is $\tau$-compact if every such covering diagram over it stabilizes at some designated small object. As we permit functors of mixed variance, our framework simultaneously models ascending chain conditions (such as Noetherianness) and descending chain conditions (such as Artinianness, topological compactness via closed sets).
The role of protomodularity of the ambient category emerges as a crucial property for proving strong closure results. Under suitable compatibility assumptions on the coverage, we show that in a protomodular category, the class of $\tau$-compact objects is closed under quotients and extensions. In a pointed context, this implies closure under finite products, generalizing the classical theorem that a finitely generated module over a Noetherian ring is itself Noetherian. We also leverage protomodularity to establish a categorical Hopfian property for Noetherian objects.
Our main application shows that in any regular protomodular category with an initial object, the classes of Noetherian and Artinian objects are closed under subobjects, regular quotients, and extensions. As a consequence, in any abelian category, these classes of objects form exact subcategories.

Probability (math.PR); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
In this work we rigorously establish a number of properties of "turbulent" solutions to the stochastic transport and the stochastic continuity equations constructed by Le Jan and Raimond in [Ann. Probab. 30(2): 826-873, 2002]. The advecting velocity field, not necessarily incompressible, is Gaussian and white-in-time, space-homogeneous and isotropic, with $\alpha$-Hölder regularity in space, $\alpha\in (0,1)$. We cover the full range of compressibility ratios giving spontaneous stochasticity of particle trajectories. For the stochastic transport equation, we prove that generic $L^2_x$ data experience anomalous dissipation of the mean energy, and study basic properties of the resulting anomalous dissipation measure. Moreover, we show that starting from such irregular data, the solution immediately gains regularity and enters into a fractional Sobolev space $H^{1-\alpha-}_x$. The proof of the latter is obtained as a consequence of a new sharp regularity result for the degenerate parabolic PDE satisfied by the associated two-point self-correlation function, which is of independent interest. In the incompressible case, a Duchon-Robert-type formula for the anomalous dissipation measure is derived, making a precise connection between this self-regularizing effect and a limit on the flux of energy in the turbulent cascade. Finally, for the stochastic continuity equation, we prove that solutions starting from a Dirac delta initial condition undergo an average squared dispersion growing with respect to time as $t^{1/(1-\alpha)}$, rigorously establishing the analogue of Richardson's law of particle separations in fluid dynamics.

Phase Transitions for Elephant Random Walks with Two memory Channels

Subjects:
Probability (math.PR); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)
Elephant random walk, introduced to study the effect of memory on random walks, is a novel type of walk that incorporates the information of one randomly chosen past step to determine the future step. However, memory of a process can be multifaceted and can arise due to interactions of more than one underlying phenomena. To model this, random walks with multiple memory channels were introduced in the statistical physics literature by Saha (2022) - here the information on a bunch of independently chosen past steps is needed to decide the future step. With the help of variance heuristics, this work analyzed the two-channel case and predicted a double phase transition: from diffusive to superdiffusive and from superdiffusive to ballistic regimes. We prove these conjectures rigorously (with some corrections), discover a mildly superdiffusive regime at one of the conjectured transition boundaries, and observe a new second-order phase transition. We also carry out a detailed investigation of the asymptotic behavior of the walk at different regimes.

This study presents novel strategies for improving the node-level performance of matrix-free evaluation of continuous and discontinuous Galerkin spatial discretizations on unstructured tetrahedral grids. In our approach the underlying integrals of a generic finite-element operator are computed cell-by-cell through numerical quadrature using tabulated dense local matrices of shape functions, achieving high throughput for low to moderate-order polynomial degrees. By employing dense matrix-matrix products instead of matrix-vector products for the cell-wise interpolation, the method reaches over $60\%$ of peak performance. The optimization strategies exploit explicit data parallelism to enhance computational efficiency, complemented by a hierarchical mesh reordering algorithm that improves data locality. The matrix-free implementation achieves up to a $6\times$ speedup compared to a global sparse matrix-based approach at a polynomial degree of three. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through numerical experiments on the Poisson and Navier--Stokes equations. The Poisson operator is preconditioned by a hybrid multigrid scheme that combines auxiliary continuous finite-element spaces, polynomial and geometric coarsening where possible while employing algebraic multigrid on the coarse mesh. Within the preconditioner, the implementation transitions between the matrix-free and matrix-based strategies for optimal efficiency. Finally, we analyze the strong scaling behavior of the Poisson and Helmholtz operators, demonstrating the method's potential to solve large real-world problems.

A case of the dijoin conjecture on inverting oriented graphs

Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
For an oriented graph $D$, the inversion of $X\subseteq V(D)$ in $D$ is the graph obtained by reversing the orientation of all arcs with both ends in $X$. The inversion number $\mathrm{inv}(D)$ is the minimum number of inversions needed to obtain an acyclic oriented graph.
We show that the dijoin conjecture of Bang-Jensen, da Silva and Havet, that $\mathrm{inv}(D_1\rightarrow D_2)=\mathrm{inv}(D_1)+\mathrm{inv}(D_2)$, is true in the case where $\mathrm{inv}(D_1)=2$ and $\mathrm{inv}(D_2)$ is even. We also characterise the cases $\mathrm{inv}(D_1)=2$ and $\mathrm{inv}(D_2)$ odd, for which the conjecture does and does not hold. We then go on to show a similar result for n-joins, in doing so we prove a conjecture of Alon, Powierski, Savery, Scott and Wilmer. Our proofs build on the idea of tournament minimum rank, introduced by Behague, Johnston, Morrison and Ogden.

In the upcoming 6G networks, integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) will be able to provide a performance boost in both perception and wireless connectivity. This paper considers a multiple base station (BS) architecture to support the comprehensive services of data transmission and multi-target sensing. In this context, a cooperative BS assignment and resource allocation (CBARA) strategy is proposed in this paper, aiming at jointly optimizing the communication and sensing (C&S) performance. The posterior Cramer-Rao lower bound and the achievable rate with respect to transmit power and bandwidth are derived and utilized as optimization criteria for the CBARA scheme. We develop a heuristic alternating optimization algorithm to obtain an effective sub-optimal solution for the non-convex optimization problem caused by multiple coupled variables. Numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed solution, which achieves a performance improvement of 117% in communication rate and 40% in sensing accuracy, compared to the classic scheme.

Dynamical Systems (math.DS); Classical Analysis and ODEs (math.CA)
We study the dynamics of a delayed predator-prey system with Holling type II functional response, focusing on the interplay between time delay and carrying capacity. Using local and global Hopf bifurcation theory, we establish the existence of sequences of bifurcations as the delay parameter varies, and prove that the connected components of global Hopf branches are nested under suitable conditions. A novel contribution is to show that the classical limit cycle of the non-delayed system belongs to a connected component of the global Hopf bifurcation in Fuller's space. Our analysis combines rigorous functional differential equation theory with continuation methods to characterize the structure and boundedness of bifurcation branches. We further demonstrate that delays can induce oscillatory coexistence at lower carrying capacities than in the corresponding ODE model, yielding counterintuitive biological insights. The results contribute to the broader theory of global bifurcations in delay differential equations while providing new perspectives on nonlinear population dynamics.

Exacting and ultraexacting cardinals are large cardinal numbers compatible with the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms of set theory, including the Axiom of Choice. In contrast with standard large cardinal notions, their existence implies that the set-theoretic universe V is not equal to Gödel's subuniverse of Hereditarily Ordinal Definable (HOD) sets. We prove that the existence of an ultraexacting cardinal is equiconsistent with the well-known axiom I0; moreover, the existence of ultraexacting cardinals together with other standard large cardinals is equiconsistent with generalizations of I0 for fine-structural models of set theory extending $L(V_{\lambda+1})$. We prove tight bounds on the strength of exacting cardinals, placing them strictly between the axioms I3 and I2. The argument extends to show that I2 implies the consistency of Vopěnka's Principle together with an exacting cardinal and the HOD Hypothesis. In particular, we obtain the following result: the existence of an extendible cardinal above an exacting cardinal does not refute the HOD Hypothesis. We also give several new characterizations of exacting and ultraexacting cardinals; first in terms of strengthenings of the axioms I3 and I1 with the addition of Ordinal Definable predicates, and finally also in terms of principles of Structural Reflection which characterize exacting and ultraexacting cardinals as natural two-cardinal forms of strong unfoldability.

Combinatorics (math.CO)
In this paper, we provide a complete classification of Cartesian products of graphs that embed in the projective plane. Our work requires us to determine minimal Cartesian products that are nonprojective planar, organize their essential properties to be used as constraints for projective planar embeddings, and explicitly construct projective planar embeddings for Cartesian products that satisfy these constraints. A corollary of our work shows that only six of the 35 forbidden minors for the projective plane are sufficient to classify projective planar Cartesian products.

Towards a category-theoretic foundation of Classical and Quantum Information Geometry

Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
We introduce the category $\mathsf{NCP}$, whose objects are pairs of W$^\ast$-algebras and normal states and whose morphisms are state-preserving unital completely positive (CPU) maps, as a common stage for classical and quantum information geometry, and we formulate two results that will appear in forthcoming works.
First, we recast the problem of classifying admissible Riemannian geometries on classical and quantum statistical models in terms of functors $\mathfrak{C}:\mathsf{NCP}\to\mathsf{Hilb}$.These functors provide a generalization of classical statistical covariance, and we call them fields of covariances. A prominent example being the so-called GNS functor arising from the Gelfand-Naimark-Segal (GNS) construction. The classification of fields of covariances on $\mathsf{NCP}$ entails both Čencov's uniqueness of the Fisher-Rao metric tensor and Petz's classification of monotone quantum metric tensors as particular cases.
Then, we show how classical and quantum statistical models can be realized as subcategories of $\mathsf{NCP}$ in a way that takes into account symmetries. In this setting, the fields of covariances determine Riemannian metric tensors on the model that reduce to the Fisher-Rao, Fubini-Study, and Bures-Helstrom metric tensor in particular cases.

New complexity bounds for primal--dual interior-point algorithms in conic optimization

Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
We provide improved complexity results for symmetric primal--dual interior-point algorithms in conic optimization. The results follow from new uniform bounds on a key complexity measure for primal--dual metrics at pairs of primal and dual points. The complexity measure is defined as the largest eigenvalue of the product of the Hessians of the primal and dual barrier functions, normalized by the proximity of the points to the central path. For algorithms based on self-scaled barriers for symmetric cones, we determine the exact value of the complexity measure. In the significantly more general case of self-concordant barriers with negative curvature, we provide the asymptotically tight upper bound of 4/3. This result implies $O(\vartheta^{1/2}\ln(1/\epsilon))$ iteration complexity for a variety of symmetric (and some nonsymmetric) primal--dual interior-point algorithms. Finally, in the case of general self-concordant barriers, we give improved bounds for some variants of the complexity measure.

Persistence probabilities for fractionally integrated fractional Brownian noise

23 pages
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
The main object the study is fractionally integrated fractional Brownian noise, I(t/a,H) where a>0 is the multiplicity(not necessarily an integer) of integration, and H is the Hurst parameter . The subject of the analysis is the persistence exponent e(a,H) that determines the power-law asymptotic of probability that the process will not exceed a fixit positive level in a growing time interval (0,T). In the important cases (a=1,H) and (a=2,H=1/2) these exponents are well known. To understand the problematic exponents e(2,H), we consider the (a,H) parameters from the maximum (for the task) area G= (a+H>1,a>0,0<H<1) ) . We prove the decrease of the exponents with increasing a and describe their behavior near the boundary of G, including infinity. The discovered identity of the exponents with the parameters (a,H) and (a+2H-1,1-H) actually refutes the long-standing hypothesis that e(2,H)=H(1-H). Our results are based on well known the continuity lemma for the persistence exponents and on a generalization of Slepian's lemma for a family of Gaussian processes smoothly dependent on a parameter.

We suggest a dependence coefficient between a categorical variable and some general variable taking values in a metric space. We derive important theoretical properties and study the large sample behaviour of our suggested estimator. Moreover, we develop an independence test which has an asymptotic $\chi^2$-distribution if the variables are independent and prove that this test is consistent against any violation of independence. We discuss some extensions, including a variant of the coefficient for measuring conditional dependence.

Large-scale Aerial Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface-aided Robust Anti-jamming Transmission

Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT)
Aerial reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (ARIS), deployed on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), could enhance anti-jamming communication performance by dynamically configuring channel conditions and establishing reliable air-ground links. However, large-scale ARIS faces critical deployment challenges due to the prohibitive computational complexity of conventional discrete optimization methods and sophisticated jamming threats. In this paper, we introduce a mean field modeling approach to design the spatial configuration of ARIS by a continuous density function, thus bypassing high-dimensional combinatorial optimization. We consider an adaptive jammer which adjusts its position and beamforming to minimize the sum-rate. A key finding reveals that the jammer's optimal strategy is governed by a proximity-directivity trade-off between reducing path loss and enhancing spatial focusing. To combat the jamming, we propose a robust anti-jamming transmission framework that jointly optimizes the BS beamforming, the ARIS reflection, and the ARIS spatial distribution to maximize the worst-case sum-rate. By leveraging variational optimization and Riemannian manifold methods, we efficiently solve the functional optimization problems. Our analysis further unveils that the optimal ARIS deployment follows a spatial water-filling principle, concentrating resources in high-gain regions while avoiding interference-prone areas. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework remarkably improves the sum-rate. Furthermore, the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is independent of the number of UAVs, validating its effectiveness for scalable ARIS-assisted anti-jamming communications.

This paper explores the energy efficiency (EE) of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems employing massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) techniques to leverage spatial beamforming gains for both communication and sensing. We focus on an mMIMO-ISAC system operating in an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing setting with a uniform planar array, zero-forcing downlink transmission, and mono-static radar sensing to exploit multi-carrier channel diversity. By deriving closed-form expressions for the achievable communication rate and Cramér-Rao bounds (CRBs), we are able to determine the overall EE in closed-form. A power allocation problem is then formulated to maximize the system's EE by balancing communication and sensing efficiency while satisfying communication rate requirements and CRB constraints. Through a detailed analysis of CRB properties, we reformulate the problem into a more manageable form and leverage Dinkelbach's and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques to develop an efficient iterative algorithm. A novel initialization strategy is also proposed to ensure high-quality feasible starting points for the iterative optimization process. Extensive simulations demonstrate the significant performance improvement of the proposed approach over baseline approaches. Results further reveal that as communication spectral efficiency rises, the influence of sensing EE on the overall system EE becomes more pronounced, even in sensing-dominated scenarios. Specifically, in the high $\omega$ regime of $2 \times 10^{-3}$, we observe a 16.7\% reduction in overall EE when spectral efficiency increases from $4$ to $8$ bps/Hz, despite the system being sensing-dominated.

Saturation for Sums of Posets and Antichains
Maria-Romina Ivan, Sean Jaffe
Comments:
16 pages, 4 figures
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
Given a finite poset $\mathcal P$, we say that a family $\mathcal F$ of subsets of $[n]$ is $\mathcal P$-saturated if $\mathcal F$ does not contain an induced copy of $\mathcal P$, but adding any other set to $\mathcal F$ creates an induced copy of $\mathcal P$. The saturation number of $\mathcal P$ is the size of the smallest $\mathcal P$-saturated family with ground set $[n]$.
The saturation numbers have been shown to exhibit a dichotomy: for any poset, the saturation number is either bounded, or at least $2\sqrt n$. The general conjecture is that in fact, the saturation number for any poset is either bounded, or at least linear.
The linear sum of two posets $\mathcal P_1$ and $\mathcal P_2$, dented by $\mathcal P_1*\mathcal P_2$, is defined as the poset obtained from a copy of $\mathcal P_1$ placed completely on top of a copy of $\mathcal P_2$. In this paper we show that the saturation number of $\mathcal P_1*\mathcal A_k*\mathcal P_2$ is always at least linear, for any $\mathcal P_1$, $\mathcal P_2$ and $k\geq2$, where $\mathcal A_k$ is the antichain of size $k$. This is a generalisation of the recent result that the saturation number for the diamond is linear (in that case $\mathcal P_1$ and $\mathcal P_2$ are both the single point poset, and $k=2$). We also show that, with the exception of chains which are known to have bounded saturation number, the saturation number for all complete multipartite posets is linear.

Near-Optimal Recovery Performance of PhaseLift for Phase Retrieval from Coded Diffraction Patterns
Meng Huang, Jinming Wen, Ran Zhang
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA); Information Theory (cs.IT)
The PhaseLift algorithm is an effective convex method for solving the phase retrieval problem from Fourier measurements with coded diffraction patterns (CDP). While exact reconstruction guarantees are well-established in the noiseless case, the stability of recovery under noise remains less well understood. In particular, when the measurements are corrupted by an additive noise vector $\mathbf{w} \in \mathbb{R}^m$, existing recovery bounds scale on the order of $\|\mathbf{w}\|_2$, which is conjectured to be suboptimal. More recently, Soltanolkotabi conjectured that the optimal PhaseLift recovery bound should scale with the average noise magnitude, that is, on the order of $\|\mathbf{w}\|_2/\sqrt m$. However, establishing this theoretically is considerably more challenging and has remained an open problem. In this paper, we focus on this conjecture and provide a nearly optimal recovery bound for it. We prove that under adversarial noise, the recovery error of PhaseLift is bounded by $O(\log n \cdot \|\mathbf{w}\|_2/\sqrt m)$, and further show that there exists a noise vector for which the error lower bound exceeds $O\bigl(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\log n}} \cdot \frac{\|\mathbf{w}\|_2}{\sqrt m}\bigr)$. Here, $n$ is the dimension of the signals we aim to recover. Moreover, for mean-zero sub-Gaussian noise vector $\mathbf{w} \in \mathbb R^m$ with sub-Gaussian norm $\sigma$, we establish a bound of order $O\bigl(\sigma \sqrt{\frac{n \log^4 n}{m}}\bigr)$, and also provide a corresponding minimax lower bound. Our results affirm Soltanolkotabi's conjecture up to logarithmic factors, providing a new insight into the stability of PhaseLift under noisy CDP measurements.

Long-time behavior of a nonlocal Cahn-Hilliard equation with nonlocal dynamic boundary condition and singular potentials

Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
We investigate the long-time behavior of a nonlocal Cahn--Hilliard equation in a bounded domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^d$ $(d=2,3)$, subject to a kinetic rate dependent nonlocal dynamic boundary condition. The kinetic rate $1/L$, with $L\in[0,+\infty)$, distinguishes different types of bulk-surface interactions. When $L\in[0,+\infty)$, for a general class of singular potentials including the physically relevant logarithmic potential, we establish the existence of a global attractor $\mathcal{A}_m^L$ in a suitable complete metric space. Moreover, we verify that the global attractor $\mathcal{A}_m^0$ is stable with respect to perturbations $\mathcal{A}_m^L$ for small $L>0$. For the case $L\in(0,+\infty)$, based on the strict separation property of solutions, we prove the existence of exponential attractors through a short trajectory type technique, which also yields that the global attractor has finite fractal dimension. Finally, when $L\in(0,+\infty)$, by usage of a generalized Łojasiewicz-Simon inequality and an Alikakos-Moser type iteration, we show that every global weak solution converges to a single equilibrium in $\mathcal{L}^\infty$ as time tends to infinity.

Starting with the pioneering computations of Stokes in 1847, the search of traveling waves in fluid mechanics has always been a fundamental topic, since they can be seen as building blocks to determine the long time dynamics (which is a widely open problem). In this paper we prove the existence of time quasi-periodic traveling wave solutions for three-dimensional pure gravity water waves in finite depth, on flat tori, with an arbitrary number of speeds of propagation. These solutions are global in time, they do not reduce to stationary solutions in any moving reference frame and they are approximately given by finite sums of Stokes waves traveling with rationally independent speeds of propagation. This is a very hard small divisors problem for Partial Differential Equations due to the fact that one deals with a dispersive quasi-linear PDE in higher dimension with a very complicated geometry of the resonances. Our result is the first KAM (Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser) result for an autonomous, dispersive, quasi-linear PDE in dimension greater than one and it is the first example of global solutions, which do not reduce to steady ones in any moving reference frame, for 3D water waves equations on compact domains.

Numerical analysis of the large deviation regime of a kinetic equation with a nonlocal Hamilton-Jacobi limit
Hélène Hivert, Tino Laidin
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
We develop and study an asymptotic-preserving (AP) numerical scheme for a linear kinetic equation in a large deviation regime. After applying a Hopf-Cole transform to the distribution function, the system exhibits the behavior of rare events, which in the limit is governed by a non-standard, nonlocal Hamilton-Jacobi equation, as identified in [E. Bouin et al., J. Lond. Math. Soc., II. Ser., 2023].
The proposed scheme efficiently handles the stiffness introduced by scaling, with a computational cost that remains uniform with respect to the small parameter. It takes advantage of the conservation properties of the original kinetic model to overcome the numerical challenges posed by stiffness. The scheme satisfies a discrete maximum principle, preserves equilibrium states, and correctly captures the asymptotic limit, recovering the viscosity solution of the limit nonlocal Hamilton-Jacobi equation.
As the limit problem is non-standard, convergence results from the literature are not directly applicable. We introduce new analytical tools based on a discrete representation formula that links the numerical scheme with the continuous setting. This allows us to prove the convergence and establish key structural properties of the method. Numerical tests support the analysis and illustrate the robustness of the scheme and the original behavior of the limit system.

Equivalence between solvability of the Dirichlet and Regularity problem under an $L^1$ Carleson condition on $\partial_t A$
Martin Ulmer
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
We study an elliptic operator $L:=\mathrm{div}(A\nabla \cdot)$ on the upper half space. It is known that solvability of the Regularity problem in $\dot{W}^{1,p}$ implies solvability of the adjoint Dirichlet problem in $L^{p'}$. Previously, Shen (2007) established a partial reverse result. In our work, we show that if we assume an $L^1$-Carleson condition on only $|\partial_t A|$ the full reverse direction holds. As a result, we obtain equivalence between solvability of the Dirichlet problem $(D)^*_{p'}$ and the Regularity problem $(R)_p$ under this condition.
As a further consequence, we can extend the class of operators for which the $L^p$ Regularity problem is solvable by operators satisfying the mixed $L^1-L^\infty$ condition. Additionally in the case of the upper half plane, this class includes operators satisfying this $L^1$-Carleson condition on $|\partial_t A|$.

Let $\mathcal{M}_g$ be the moduli space of hyperbolic surfaces of genus g endowed with the Weil-Petersson metric. In this paper, we introduce a function $L(g)$ of genus $g$ and call the geodesics whose length less than $L(g)$ short geodesics. We compute the growth rate on the volume of the subset of hyperbolic surfaces with short geodesics. In particular, when $g$ approaches infinity, if $L(g)$ also approaches infinity, then the volume of surfaces characterized by short geodesics is equal to $V_g$ almost surely.

The rank distribution of matrices representing graphs with a long induced path over the field of two elements

Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
A square matrix $M$ represents a graph $\Gamma$ if its nonzero off-diagonal entries encode the adjacencies of $\Gamma$, subject to a fixed ordering of the vertices. Over the field of two elements, we investigate the distribution of ranks in the affine space consisting of all matrices representing a given $\Gamma$. In particular, we consider which graphs of order $n$ are represented by more matrices of rank $n-1$ than of rank $n$. This property reflects an exceptional feature of the space $M_n(\mathbb{F}_2)$ of all $n\times n$ matrices over $\mathbb{F}_2$, namely that its most frequently occurring rank is not $n$ but $n-1$. Our analysis focuses on the class of connected graphs with an induced path on all but one vertex. The main result is a characterisation of all such graphs that are represented by more matrices of rank $n-1$ than of rank $n$ over $\mathbb{F}_2$.

Mathematical and numerical study of symmetry and positivity of the tensor-valued spring constant defined from P1-FEM for two- and three-dimensional linear elasticity

Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
In this study, we consider a spring-block system that approximates a $d$-dimensional linear elastic body, where $d=2$ or $d=3$. We derive a $d\times d$ matrix as the spring constant using the P1 finite element method with a triangular mesh for the linear elasticity equations. We mathematically analyze the symmetry and positive-definiteness of the spring constant. Even if we assume full symmetry of the elasticity tensor, the symmetry of the matrix obtained as the spring constant is not trivial. However, we have succeeded in proving this in a unified manner for both 2D and 3D cases. This is an alternative proof for the 2D case in Notsu-Kimura (2014) and is a new result for the 3D case. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the spring constant to be positive-definite in the case of an isotropic elasticity tensor, along with a sufficient condition in terms of mesh regularity and the Poisson ratio. These theoretical results are supported by several numerical experiments. The positive-definiteness of the spring constant derived from the finite element method plays a vital role in fracture simulations of elastic bodies using the spring-block system.

Solutions to Differential Algebraic Inequalities with Composite Bernstein Polynomials

Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
The Bernstein polynomial basis sees significant use owing to its unique properties, particularly in the field of optimal control. However, the basis is known to have a slow rate of convergence to the function it approximates. With this in mind, we introduce two collocation methods for solving general ordinary differential equations using composite Bernstein polynomials to preserve the basis properties while improving convergence. Of particular note is the integration based method which uses a minimal number of variables to describe the resulting composite polynomial, reducing computational effort. In addition, we exploit the convex hull property of the Bernstein polynomial basis in order to enforce inequality constraints in differential algebraic inequalities, highlighting the benefits of the basis in function approximation. Solutions to six numerical examples are provided as well as discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed solution methodologies.

We study orthogonal polynomials on a fully symmetric planar domain $\Omega$ that is generated by a certain triangle in the first quadrant. For a family of weight functions on $\Omega$, we show that orthogonal polynomials that are even in the second variable on $\Omega$ can be identified with orthogonal polynomials on the unit disk composed with a quadratic map, and the same phenomenon can be extended to the domain generated by the rotation of $\Omega$ in higher dimensions. The connection allows an immediate deduction of results for approximation and Fourier orthogonal expansions on these fully symmetric domains. It applies, for example, to analysis on a double cone or a double hyperboloid.

Probability (math.PR); Functional Analysis (math.FA)
We study regression of $1$-Lipschitz functions under a log-concave measure $\mu$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$. We focus on the high-dimensional regime where the sample size $n$ is subexponential in $d$, in which distribution-free estimators are ineffective. We analyze two polynomial-based procedures: the projection estimator, which relies on knowledge of an orthogonal polynomial basis of $\mu$, and the least-squares estimator over low-degree polynomials, which requires no knowledge of $\mu$ whatsoever. Their risk is governed by the rate of polynomial approximation of Lipschitz functions in $L^2(\mu)$. When this rate matches the Gaussian one, we show that both estimators achieve minimax bounds over a wide range of parameters. A key ingredient is sharp entropy estimates for the class of $1$-Lipschitz functions in $L^2(\mu)$, which are new even in the Gaussian setting.

Constrained Variational Inference via Safe Particle Flow
Yinzhuang Yi, Jorge Cortés, Nikolay Atanasov
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC); Systems and Control (eess.SY)
We propose a control barrier function (CBF) formulation for enforcing equality and inequality constraints in variational inference. The key idea is to define a barrier functional on the space of probability density functions that encode the desired constraints imposed on the variational density. By leveraging the Liouville equation, we establish a connection between the time derivative of the variational density and the particle drift, which enables the systematic construction of corresponding CBFs associated to the particle drift. Enforcing these CBFs gives rise to the safe particle flow and ensures that the variational density satisfies the original constraints imposed by the barrier functional. This formulation provides a principled and computationally tractable solution to constrained variational inference, with theoretical guarantees of constraint satisfaction. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through numerical simulations.

Given an orthogonally invariant probability measure on $GL(d,\mathbb{R})$, Mike Shub asked whether the average product of the $k$ top eigenvalues in the ensemble can be lower bounded by the average distortion along $k$ dimensional Grassmanians. Recently, Armentano, Chinta, Sahi, and Shub provided partial progress, however they attach a constant $c_{d,k} \to 0 as d \to \infty$. In this paper, by invoking the Single Ring Theorem and sequels, we show the conjecture asymptotically for the spectral radius, in particular, $c_{d,k} \to 1$ as $d \to \infty$, and $k = 1$.

Recently, the first author with A. Ardehali, M. Lemos, and L. Rastelli introduced the notion of graded unitarity for vertex algebras. This generalization of unitarity is motivated by the SCFT/VOA correspondence and introduces a novel Hilbert space structure on the state space of a large class of vertex algebras that are not unitary in the conventional sense. In this paper, we study the relative semi-infinite cohomology of graded-unitary vertex algebras that admit a chiral quantum moment map for an affine current algebra at twice the critical level. We show that the relative semi-infinite chain complex for such a graded-unitary vertex algebra has a structure analogous to that of differential forms on a compact Kähler manifold, generalizing a strong form of the classic construction of Banks--Peskin and Frenkel--Garland--Zuckerman. We deduce that the relative semi-infinite cohomology is itself graded-unitary, which establishes graded unitarity for a large class of vertex operator algebras arising from three- and four-dimensional supersymmetric quantum field theories. We further establish an outer USp$(2)$ action on the semi-infinite cohomology (which does not respect cohomological grading), analogous to the Lefschetz $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$ in Kähler geometry. We also show that the semi-infinite chain complex is quasi-isomorphic as a differential graded vertex algebra to its cohomology, in analogy to the formality result of Deligne--Griffiths--Morgan--Sullivan for the de Rham cohomology of compact Kähler manifolds. We conclude by observing consequences of these results to the associated Poisson vertex algebras and related finite-type derived Poisson reductions.

Dominic Blanco, Matthieu Cadiot
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
In this article, we extend the framework developed previously to allow for rigorous proofs of existence of smooth, localized solutions in semi-linear partial differential equations possessing both space and non-space group symmetries. We demonstrate our approach on the Swift-Hohenberg model. In particular, for a given symmetry group $\mathcal{G}$, we construct a natural Hilbert space $H^l_{\mathcal{G}}$ containing only functions with $\mathcal{G}$-symmetry. In this space, products and differential operators are well-defined allowing for the study of autonomous semi-linear PDEs. Depending on the properties of $\mathcal{G}$, we derive a Newton-Kantorovich approach based on the construction of an approximate inverse around an approximate solution, $u_0$. More specifically, combining a meticulous analysis and computer-assisted techniques, the Newton-Kantorovich approach is validated thanks to the computation of some explicit bounds. The strategy for constructing $u_0$, the approximate inverse, and the computation of these bounds will depend on the properties of $\mathcal{G}$. We demonstrate the methodology on the 2D Swift-Hohenberg PDE by proving the existence of various dihedral localized patterns. The algorithmic details to perform the computer-assisted proofs can be found on Github.

A Fibonacci-Based Gödel Numbering: $Δ_0$ Semantics Without Exponentiation
Milan Rosko
Comments:
15 pages. Theoretical paper in mathematical logic and bounded arithmetic
Subjects:
Logic (math.LO)
We introduce a more efficient Gödel encoding scheme based on Zeckendorf representations of natural numbers, avoiding the use of unbounded exponentiation and without appealing to the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. The resulting encoding is injective, primitive recursive, and $\Delta_0$-definable in weak arithmetical theories such as $I\Delta_0 + \Omega_1$. This allows for the construction of fixed points and the formalization of incompleteness theorems entirely within bounded arithmetic. Compared to traditional prime-exponent $\Pi$ codings, the Zeckendorf approach yields longer codes but supports simpler substitution mechanisms and more transparent definability properties.

Gromov hyperbolicity III: improved geometric characterization in Euclidean spaces and beyond

Complex Variables (math.CV); Metric Geometry (math.MG)
This is the third article of a series of our recent works, addressing an open question of Bonk-Heinonen-Koskela [3], to study the relationship between (inner) uniformality and Gromov hyperbolicity in infinite dimensional spaces. Our main focus of this paper is to establish improved geometric characterization of Gromov hyperbolicity.
More precisely, we develop an elementary measure-independent approach to establish the geometric characterization of Gromov hyperbolicity for general proper Euclidean subdomains, which addresses a conjecture of Bonk-Heinonen-Koskela [Asterisque 2001] for unbounded Euclidean subdomains. Our main results not only improve the corresponding result of Balogh-Buckley [Invent. Math. 2003], but also clean up the relationship between the two geometric conditions, ball separation condition and Gehring-Hayman inequality, that used to characterize Gromov hyperbolicity. We also provide a negative answer to an open problem of Balogh-Buckley by constructing an Euclidean domain with ball separation property but fails to satisfy the Gehring-Hayman inequality. Furthermore, we prove that ball separation condition, together with an LLC-2 condition, implies inner uniformality and thus the Gehring-Hayman inequality.
As a consequence of our new approach, we are able to prove such a geometric characterization of Gromov hyperbolicity in the fairly general setting of metric spaces (without measures), which substantially improves the main result of Koskela-Lammi-Manojlović [Ann. Sci. Éc. Norm. Supér. 2014]. In particular, we not only provide a new purely metric proof of the main reuslt of Balogh-Buckley and Koskela-Lammi-Manojlović, but also derive explicit dependence of various involved constants, which improves all the previous known results.

We use elementary methods to establish three key recurrence relations: one for derangement numbers, a second for harmonic numbers, and a third for degenerate harmonic numbers. Our results not only contribute to the understanding of the underlying structure of these numbers but also highlight the effectiveness of elementary techniques in discovering new mathematical properties. The findings have potential applications in various fields where these numbers appear, including combinatorics, probability, and computer science.

Multiscaling in Wasserstein Spaces
Wael Mattar, Nir Sharon
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
We present a novel multiscale framework for analyzing sequences of probability measures in Wasserstein spaces over Euclidean domains. Exploiting the intrinsic geometry of optimal transport, we construct a multiscale transform applicable to both absolutely continuous and discrete measures. Central to our approach is a refinement operator based on McCann's interpolants, which preserves the geodesic structure of measure flows and serves as an upsampling mechanism. Building on this, we introduce the optimality number, a scalar that quantifies deviations of a sequence from Wasserstein geodesicity across scales, enabling the detection of irregular dynamics and anomalies. We establish key theoretical guarantees, including stability of the transform and geometric decay of coefficients, ensuring robustness and interpretability of the multiscale representation. Finally, we demonstrate the versatility of our methodology through numerical experiments: denoising and anomaly detection in Gaussian flows, analysis of point cloud dynamics under vector fields, and the multiscale characterization of neural network learning trajectories.

Witt Groups and Bulk-Boundary Correspondence for Stabilizer States

Subjects:

We establish a bulk--boundary correspondence for translation-invariant stabilizer states in arbitrary spatial dimension, formulated in the framework of modules over Laurent polynomial rings. To each stabilizer state restricted to half-space geometry we associate a boundary operator module. Boundary operator modules provide examples of quasi-symplectic modules, which are objects of independent mathematical interest. In their study, we use ideas from algebraic L-theory in a setting involving non-projective modules and non-unimodular forms. Our results about quasi-symplectic modules in one spatial dimension allow us to resolve the conjecture that every stabilizer state in two dimensions is characterized by a corresponding abelian anyon model with gappable boundary. Our techniques are also applicable beyond two dimensions, such as in the study of fractons.

A study of ferronematic thin films including a stray field energy

Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
Ferronematic materials are colloidal suspensions of magnetic particles in liquid crystals. They are complex materials with potential applications in display technologies, sensors, microfluidics devices, etc. We consider a model for ferronematics in a 2D domain with a variational approach. The proposed free energy of the ferronematic system depends on the Landau-de Gennes (LdG) order parameter $\mathbf{Q}$ and the magnetization $\mathbf{M}$, and incorporates the complex interaction between the liquid crystal molecules and the magnetic particles in the presence of an external magnetic field $\mathbf{H}_{ext}$. The energy functional combines the Landau-de Gennes nematic energy density and energy densities from the theory of micromagnetics including (an approximation of) the stray field energy and energetic contributions from an external magnetic field. For the proposed ferronematic energy, we first prove the existence of an energy minimizer and then the uniqueness of the minimizer in certain parameter regimes. Secondly, we numerically compute stable ferronematic equilibria by solving the gradient flow equations associated with the proposed ferronematic energy. The numerical results show that the stray field influences the localization of the interior nematic defects and magnetic vortices.

We introduce the notion of r-defectivity for a vector bundle on a quasi-projective variety. Using this tool, we prove several previously unknown cases of Fröberg's conjecture and also of the postulation problem for fat point schemes. Our techniques also allow us to study r-nondefectivity for joins and secants of reducible varieties. As a consequence, we derive results for mixture distributions and partition ranks.

We derive expressions for the Virasoro OPE and four-point conformal blocks on the sphere via the resolution of identity recently determined in [Phys. Rev. D 111, 085010 (2025), arXiv:2409.12224]. Even though the resolution of the identity depends on Virasoro singular vectors, our expression for the blocks does not depend on their precise form, but just on their well-known conformal weights. We verify that our expression is compatible with -- but differs from -- Zamolodchikov's $h$-recursion relation and we also examine the impact of various large central charge limits in our formula. A Mathematica notebook with a simple implementation of our expression for the Virasoro conformal blocks is provided as an ancillary file.

When an optimal treatment regime (OTR) is considered, we need to evaluate the OTR in a valid and efficient way. The classical inference applied to the mean outcome under OTR, assuming the OTR is the same as the estimated OTR, might be biased when the regularity assumption that OTR is unique is violated. Although several methods have been proposed to allow nonregularity in such inference, its optimality is unclear due to challenges in deriving semiparametric efficiency bounds under potential nonregularity. In this paper, we address the bias issue via adaptive smoothing over the estimated OTR and develop a valid inference procedure on the mean outcome under OTR regardless of whether regularity is satisfied. We establish the optimality of the proposed method by deriving a lower bound of the asymptotic variance for the robust asymptotically linear unbiased estimator to the mean outcome under OTR and showing that our proposed estimator achieves the variance lower bound. The considered estimator class is general and the derived variance lower bound paves a novel way to establish efficiency optimality theories for OTR in a more general scenario allowing nonregularity. The merit of the proposed method is demonstrated by re-analyzing the ACTG 175 trial.

A scenario is considered wherein a stationary, turn constrained agent (Turret) and a mobile agent (Defender) cooperate to protect the former from an adversarial mobile agent (Attacker). The Attacker wishes to reach the Turret prior to getting captured by either the Defender or Turret, if possible. Meanwhile, the Defender and Turret seek to capture the Attacker as far from the Turret as possible. This scenario is formulated as a differential game and solved using a geometric approach. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the Turret-Defender team winning and the Attacker winning are given. In the case of the Turret-Defender team winning equilibrium strategies for the min max terminal distance of the Attacker to the Turret are given. Three cases arise corresponding to solo capture by the Defender, solo capture by the Turret, and capture simultaneously by both Turret and Defender.

Locally Permuted Low Rank Column-wise Sensing

Subjects:

We precisely formulate, and provide a solution for, the Low Rank Columnwise Sensing (LRCS) problem when some of the observed data is scrambled/permuted/unlabeled. This problem, which we refer to as permuted LRCS, lies at the intersection of two distinct topics of recent research: unlabeled sensing and low rank column-wise (matrix) sensing. We introduce a novel generalization of the recently developed Alternating Gradient Descent and Minimization (AltGDMin) algorithm to solve this problem. We also develop an alternating minimization (AltMin) solution. We show, using simulation experiments, that both converge but PermutedAltGDmin is much faster than Permuted-AltMin.

SciML Agents: Write the Solver, Not the Solution

Machine Learning (cs.LG); Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
Recent work in scientific machine learning aims to tackle scientific tasks directly by predicting target values with neural networks (e.g., physics-informed neural networks, neural ODEs, neural operators, etc.), but attaining high accuracy and robustness has been challenging. We explore an alternative view: use LLMs to write code that leverages decades of numerical algorithms. This shifts the burden from learning a solution function to making domain-aware numerical choices. We ask whether LLMs can act as SciML agents that, given a natural-language ODE description, generate runnable code that is scientifically appropriate, selecting suitable solvers (stiff vs. non-stiff), and enforcing stability checks. There is currently no benchmark to measure this kind of capability for scientific computing tasks. As such, we first introduce two new datasets: a diagnostic dataset of adversarial "misleading" problems; and a large-scale benchmark of 1,000 diverse ODE tasks. The diagnostic set contains problems whose superficial appearance suggests stiffness, and that require algebraic simplification to demonstrate non-stiffness; and the large-scale benchmark spans stiff and non-stiff ODE regimes. We evaluate open- and closed-source LLM models along two axes: (i) unguided versus guided prompting with domain-specific knowledge; and (ii) off-the-shelf versus fine-tuned variants. Our evaluation measures both executability and numerical validity against reference solutions. We find that with sufficient context and guided prompts, newer instruction-following models achieve high accuracy on both criteria. In many cases, recent open-source systems perform strongly without fine-tuning, while older or smaller models still benefit from fine-tuning. Overall, our preliminary results indicate that careful prompting and fine-tuning can yield a specialized LLM agent capable of reliably solving simple ODE problems.

This paper is motivated by the following problem. Define a quantum walk on a positively weighted path (linear chain). Can the weights be tuned so that perfect state transfer occurs between the first vertex and any other position? We do not fully answer this question - in fact, we show that a particular case of this problem is equivalent to a solution of a particular case of the well known Prouhet-Tarry-Escott problem, deeming our original task certainly harder than anticipated. In our journey, we prove new results about sequences of orthogonal polynomials satisfying three-term recurrences. In particular, we provide a full characterization of when two polynomials belong to such a sequence, which (as far as we were able to ascertain) was known only for when their degrees differ by one.

Confidence Intervals for Extinction Risk: Validating Population Viability Analysis with Limited Data

Subjects:
Methodology (stat.ME); Statistics Theory (math.ST)
Quantitative assessment of extinction risk requires not only point estimates but also confidence intervals (CIs) that remain informative with limited data. Their reliability has been debated, as short observation spans can inflate uncertainty and reduce usefulness. I derive new CIs for extinction probability $G$ under the Wiener process with drift, a canonical model of population viability analysis. The method uses correlated noncentral-$t$ distributions for the transformed statistics $\widehat{w}$ and $\widehat{z}$, derived from drift and variance estimators, and constructs CIs of the extinction probability by exploiting the geometric properties of $G(\widehat{w},\widehat{z})$ in parameter space. Monte Carlo experiments show that the proposed intervals attain nominal coverage with narrower widths than common approximate methods, including the delta method, moment-based approaches, and bootstrap. A key result is that even with short time series, extinction probabilities that are very small or very large can be estimated reliably. This resolves a long-standing concern that population viability analysis fails under data scarcity. Applied to three 64-year catch series for Japanese eel (Anguilla japonica), the analysis indicates extinction risk well below the IUCN Criterion E thresholds for Critically Endangered and Endangered, with narrow CIs. These findings demonstrate that extinction-risk CIs can be both statistically rigorous and practical for Red List evaluations, even when data are limited.

Intrinsic Dimension Estimating Autoencoder (IDEA) Using CancelOut Layer and a Projected Loss

Subjects:
Machine Learning (cs.LG); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
This paper introduces the Intrinsic Dimension Estimating Autoencoder (IDEA), which identifies the underlying intrinsic dimension of a wide range of datasets whose samples lie on either linear or nonlinear manifolds. Beyond estimating the intrinsic dimension, IDEA is also able to reconstruct the original dataset after projecting it onto the corresponding latent space, which is structured using re-weighted double CancelOut layers. Our key contribution is the introduction of the projected reconstruction loss term, guiding the training of the model by continuously assessing the reconstruction quality under the removal of an additional latent dimension. We first assess the performance of IDEA on a series of theoretical benchmarks to validate its robustness. These experiments allow us to test its reconstruction ability and compare its performance with state-of-the-art intrinsic dimension estimators. The benchmarks show good accuracy and high versatility of our approach. Subsequently, we apply our model to data generated from the numerical solution of a vertically resolved one-dimensional free-surface flow, following a pointwise discretization of the vertical velocity profile in the horizontal direction, vertical direction, and time. IDEA succeeds in estimating the dataset's intrinsic dimension and then reconstructs the original solution by working directly within the projection space identified by the network.

A Note on Constructive Canonical Splitter Strategies in Nowhere Dense Graph Classes

Subjects:
Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO); Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM); Logic (math.LO)
The radius-$r$ splitter game is played on a graph $G$ between two players: Splitter and Connector. In each round, Connector selects a vertex $v$, and the current game arena is restricted to the radius-$r$ neighborhood of $v$. Then Splitter removes a vertex from this restricted subgraph. The game ends, and Splitter wins, when the arena becomes empty. Splitter aims to end the game as quickly as possible, while Connector tries to prolong it for as long as possible. The splitter game was introduced by Grohe, Kreutzer and Siebertz to characterize nowhere dense graph classes. They showed that a class $\mathscr{C}$ of graphs is nowhere dense if and only if for every radius $r$ there exists a number $\ell$ such that Splitter has a strategy on every $G\in \mathscr{C}$ to win the radius-$r$ splitter game in at most $\ell$ rounds. It was recently proved by Ohlmann et al. that there are only a bounded number of possible Splitter moves that are progressing, that is, moves that lead to an arena where Splitter can win in one less round. The proof of Ohlmann et al. is based on the compactness theorem and does not give a constructive bound on the number of progressing moves. In this work, we give a simple constructive proof, showing that if Splitter can force a win in the radius-$r$ game in $k$ rounds, then there are at most $(2r+1)^{\,2^{k-1}-1}$ progressing moves.

Toward Minimum Graphic Parity Networks

Quantum circuits composed of CNOT and $R_z$ are fundamental building blocks of many quantum algorithms, so optimizing the synthesis of such quantum circuits is crucial. We address this problem from a theoretical perspective by studying the graphic parity network synthesis problem. A graphic parity network for a graph $G$ is a quantum circuit composed solely of CNOT gates where each edge of $G$ is represented in the circuit, and the final state of the wires matches the original input. We aim to synthesize graphic parity networks with the minimum number of gates, specifically for quantum algorithms addressing combinatorial optimization problems with Ising formulations. We demonstrate that a graphic parity network for a connected graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges requires at least $m+n-1$ gates. This lower bound can be improved to $m+\Omega(m) = m+\Omega(n^{1.5})$ when the shortest cycle in the graph has a length of at least five. We complement this result with a simple randomized algorithm that synthesizes a graphic parity network with expected $m + O(n^{1.5}\sqrt{\log n})$ gates. Additionally, we begin exploring connected graphs that allow for graphic parity networks with exactly $m+n-1$ gates. We conjecture that all such graphs belong to a newly defined graph class. Furthermore, we present a linear-time algorithm for synthesizing minimum graphic parity networks for graphs within this class. However, this graph class is not closed under taking induced subgraphs, and we show that recognizing it is $\textsf{NP}$-complete, which is complemented with a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm parameterized by the treewidth.

We are surrounded by spatio-temporal patterns resulting from the interaction of the numerous basic units constituting natural or human-made systems. In presence of diffusive-like coupling, Turing theory has been largely applied to explain the formation of such self-organized motifs both on continuous domains or networked systems, where reactions occur in the nodes and the available links are used for species to diffuse. In many relevant applications, those links are not static, as very often assumed, but evolve in time and more importantly they adapt their weights to the states of the nodes. In this work, we make one step forward and we provide a general theory to prove the validity of Turing idea in the case of adaptive symmetric networks with positive weights. The conditions for the emergence of Turing instability rely on the spectral property of the Laplace matrix and the model parameters, thus strengthening the interplay between dynamics and network topology. A rich variety of patterns are presented by using two prototype models of nonlinear dynamical systems, the Brusselator and the FitzHugh-Nagumo model. Because many empirical networks adapt to changes in the system states, our results pave the way for a thorough understanding of self-organization in real-world systems.

Federated Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Privacy-Preserving and Energy-Aware Resource Management in 6G Edge Networks
Francisco Javier Esono Nkulu Andong, Qi Min
Subjects:
Machine Learning (cs.LG); Information Theory (cs.IT)
As sixth-generation (6G) networks move toward ultra-dense, intelligent edge environments, efficient resource management under stringent privacy, mobility, and energy constraints becomes critical. This paper introduces a novel Federated Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (Fed-MARL) framework that incorporates cross-layer orchestration of both the MAC layer and application layer for energy-efficient, privacy-preserving, and real-time resource management across heterogeneous edge devices. Each agent uses a Deep Recurrent Q-Network (DRQN) to learn decentralized policies for task offloading, spectrum access, and CPU energy adaptation based on local observations (e.g., queue length, energy, CPU usage, and mobility). To protect privacy, we introduce a secure aggregation protocol based on elliptic curve Diffie Hellman key exchange, which ensures accurate model updates without exposing raw data to semi-honest adversaries. We formulate the resource management problem as a partially observable multi-agent Markov decision process (POMMDP) with a multi-objective reward function that jointly optimizes latency, energy efficiency, spectral efficiency, fairness, and reliability under 6G-specific service requirements such as URLLC, eMBB, and mMTC. Simulation results demonstrate that Fed-MARL outperforms centralized MARL and heuristic baselines in task success rate, latency, energy efficiency, and fairness, while ensuring robust privacy protection and scalability in dynamic, resource-constrained 6G edge networks.

Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Information Theory (cs.IT)
We construct good GKP (Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill) codes (in the sense of Conrad, Eisert and Seifert proposed) from standard short integer solution lattices (SIS) as well as from ring SIS and module SIS lattices, R-SIS and M-SIS lattices, respectively. These lattice are crucial for lattice-based cryptography. Our construction yields GKP codes with distance $\sqrt{n/\pi e}$. This compares favorably with the NTRU-based construction by Conrad et al. that achieves distance $\Omega(\sqrt{n/q}),$ with $n\le q^2/0.28$. Unlike their codes, our codes do not have secret keys that can be used to speed-up the decoding. However, we present a simple decoding algorithm that, for many parameter choices, experimentally yields decoding results similar to the ones for NTRU-based codes. Using the R-SIS and M-SIS construction, our simple decoding algorithm runs in nearly linear time. Following Conrad, Eisert and Seifert's work, our construction of GKP codes follows directly from an explicit, randomized construction of symplectic lattices with (up to constants $\approx 1$) minimal distance $(1/\sigma_{2n})^{1/2n}\approx \sqrt{\frac{n}{\pi e}}$, where $\sigma_{2n}$ is the volume of the 2n-dimensional unit ball. Before this result, Buser and Sarnak gave a non-constructive proof for the existence of such symplectic lattices.

Physics-informed sensor coverage through structure preserving machine learning

Subjects:
Machine Learning (cs.LG); Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
We present a machine learning framework for adaptive source localization in which agents use a structure-preserving digital twin of a coupled hydrodynamic-transport system for real-time trajectory planning and data assimilation. The twin is constructed with conditional neural Whitney forms (CNWF), coupling the numerical guarantees of finite element exterior calculus (FEEC) with transformer-based operator learning. The resulting model preserves discrete conservation, and adapts in real time to streaming sensor data. It employs a conditional attention mechanism to identify: a reduced Whitney-form basis; reduced integral balance equations; and a source field, each compatible with given sensor measurements. The induced reduced-order environmental model retains the stability and consistency of standard finite-element simulation, yielding a physically realizable, regular mapping from sensor data to the source field. We propose a staggered scheme that alternates between evaluating the digital twin and applying Lloyd's algorithm to guide sensor placement, with analysis providing conditions for monotone improvement of a coverage functional. Using the predicted source field as an importance function within an optimal-recovery scheme, we demonstrate recovery of point sources under continuity assumptions, highlighting the role of regularity as a sufficient condition for localization. Experimental comparisons with physics-agnostic transformer architectures show improved accuracy in complex geometries when physical constraints are enforced, indicating that structure preservation provides an effective inductive bias for source identification.

Vendi Information Gain for Active Learning and its Application to Ecology

Machine Learning (cs.LG); Information Theory (cs.IT); Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE)
While monitoring biodiversity through camera traps has become an important endeavor for ecological research, identifying species in the captured image data remains a major bottleneck due to limited labeling resources. Active learning -- a machine learning paradigm that selects the most informative data to label and train a predictive model -- offers a promising solution, but typically focuses on uncertainty in the individual predictions without considering uncertainty across the entire dataset. We introduce a new active learning policy, Vendi information gain (VIG), that selects images based on their impact on dataset-wide prediction uncertainty, capturing both informativeness and diversity. Applied to the Snapshot Serengeti dataset, VIG achieves impressive predictive accuracy close to full supervision using less than 10% of the labels. It consistently outperforms standard baselines across metrics and batch sizes, collecting more diverse data in the feature space. VIG has broad applicability beyond ecology, and our results highlight its value for biodiversity monitoring in data-limited environments.

Neural mass models describe the mean-field dynamics of populations of neurons. In this work we illustrate how fundamental ideas of physics, such as energy and conserved quantities, can be explored for such models. We show that time-rescaling renders recent next-generation neural mass models Hamiltonian in the limit of a homogeneous population or strong coupling. The corresponding energy-like quantity provides considerable insight into the model dynamics even in the case of heterogeneity, and explain for example why orbits are near-ellipsoidal and predict spike amplitude during bursting dynamics. We illustrate how these energy considerations provide a possible link between neuronal population behavior and energy landscape theory, which has been used to analyze data from brain recordings.

Title:
Understanding Outer Optimizers in Local SGD: Learning Rates, Momentum, and Acceleration
Ahmed Khaled, Satyen Kale, Arthur Douillard, Chi Jin, Rob Fergus, Manzil Zaheer
Subjects:
Machine Learning (cs.LG); Optimization and Control (math.OC); Machine Learning (stat.ML)
Modern machine learning often requires training with large batch size, distributed data, and massively parallel compute hardware (like mobile and other edge devices or distributed data centers). Communication becomes a major bottleneck in such settings but methods like Local Stochastic Gradient Descent (Local SGD) show great promise in reducing this additional communication overhead. Local SGD consists of three parts: a local optimization process, an aggregation mechanism, and an outer optimizer that uses the aggregated updates from the nodes to produce a new model. While there exists an extensive literature on understanding the impact of hyperparameters in the local optimization process, the choice of outer optimizer and its hyperparameters is less clear. We study the role of the outer optimizer in Local SGD, and prove new convergence guarantees for the algorithm. In particular, we show that tuning the outer learning rate allows us to (a) trade off between optimization error and stochastic gradient noise variance, and (b) make up for ill-tuning of the inner learning rate. Our theory suggests that the outer learning rate should sometimes be set to values greater than $1$. We extend our results to settings where we use momentum in the outer optimizer, and we show a similar role for the momentum-adjusted outer learning rate. We also study acceleration in the outer optimizer and show that it improves the convergence rate as a function of the number of communication rounds, improving upon the convergence rate of prior algorithms that apply acceleration locally. Finally, we also introduce a novel data-dependent analysis of Local SGD that yields further insights on outer learning rate tuning. We conduct comprehensive experiments with standard language models and various outer optimizers to validate our theory.

Title:
A linear-time algorithm for Chow decompositions
Alexander Taveira Blomenhofer, Benjamin Lovitz
Comments:
21 pages. Comments welcome
Subjects:
Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS); Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
We propose a linear-time algorithm to compute low-rank Chow decompositions. Our algorithm can decompose concise symmetric 3-tensors in n variables of Chow rank n/3. The algorithm is pencil based, hence it relies on generalized eigenvalue computations. We also develop sub-quadratic time algorithms for higher order Chow decompositions, and Chow decompositions of 3-tensors into products of linear forms which do not lie on the generic orbit. In particular, we obtain a sub-quadratic-time algorithm for decomposing a symmetric 3-tensor into a linear combination of W-tensors.

Matricial Closure

We study a closure operator derived from the matrix endofunctor on the category of rings with unity. We investigate the invariance of various ring-theoretic properties under this operator. A key finding is the decisive nature of this operator: a property is either preserved for all rings or fails for all rings. This work provides a comprehensive analysis of the behavior of ring properties under matricial closure, including chain conditions, radical-theoretic properties, and other structural characteristics.

Representation Theory (math.RT)
Let G be a connected reductive group defined over a non-archimedean local field of characteristic 0. We assume G is quasi-split, adjoint and absolutly simple. Let g be the Lie algebra of G. We consider the space of the invariant distributions on g(F), which are stable and supported by the set of nilpotent elements of g(F). Magdy Assem has stated several conjectures which describe this space. We prove some of these conjectures, assuming that the residual characteristic of F is ''very large'' relatively to G.

Spinorial methods have proven to be a powerful tool to study geometric properties of spin manifolds. Our aim is to continue the spinorial study of manifolds that are not necessarily spin. We introduce and study the notion of $G$-invariance of spin$^r$ structures on a manifold $M$ equipped with an action of a Lie group $G$. For the case when $M$ is a homogeneous $G$-space, we prove a classification result of these invariant structures in terms of the isotropy representation. As an example, we study the invariant spin$^r$ structures for all the homogeneous realisations of the spheres.

We study the asymptotic behavior of the solutions of the time-delayed higher-order dispersive nonlinear differential equation \begin{equation*} u_t(x,t)+Au(x,t) +\lambda_0(x) u(x,t)+\lambda(x) u(x,t-\tau )=0 \end{equation*} where \begin{equation*} Au=(-1)^{j+1}\partial_x^{2j+1}u+(-1)^m\partial_x^{2m}u+ \frac{1}{p+1}\partial_xu^{p+1} \end{equation*} with $m\le j$ and $1\le p<2j$. Under suitable assumptions on the time delay coefficients, we prove that the system is exponentially stable if the coefficient of the delay term is bounded from below by a suitable positive constant, without any assumption on the sign of the coefficient of the undelayed feedback. Additionally, in the absence of delay, general results of stabilization are established in $H^s(\mathbb{R})$ for $s\in[0,2j+1]$. Our results generalize several previous theorems for the Korteweg-de Vries type delayed systems in the literature.

Backward Filtering Forward Guiding (BFFG) is a bidirectional algorithm proposed in Mider et al. [2021] and studied more in depth in a general setting in Van der Meulen and Schauer [2022]. In category theory, optics have been proposed for modelling systems with bidirectional data flow. We connect BFFG with optics by demonstrating that the forward and backwards map together define a functor from a category of Markov kernels into a category of optics, which is furthermore lax monoidal in the case when the guiding kernels coincide with the generative dynamics

Multigraded linear series generalize the classical morphism to the linear series of a basepoint-free line bundle on a scheme. We investigate the collection of the natural cornering morphisms into elementary bigraded linear series obtained from direct summands of the original globally generated vector bundle. Our main result is a condition on the injectivity of the product morphism. We apply our result in three examples: modules over the reconstruction algebra, equivariant Hilbert and Quot schemes of quotient stacks and Kapranov's tilting bundle over the Grassmannian.

Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Combinatorics (math.CO)
The moduli space of stable rational curves with marked points has two distinguished families of maps: the forgetful maps, given by forgetting some of the markings, and the Kapranov maps, given by complete linear series of $\psi$-classes. The collection of all these maps embeds the moduli space into a product of projective spaces. We call the multidegrees of this embedding ``Kapranov degrees,'' which include as special cases the work of Witten, Silversmith, Gallet--Grasegger--Schicho, Castravet--Tevelev, Postnikov, Cavalieri--Gillespie--Monin, and Gillespie--Griffins--Levinson. We establish, in terms of a combinatorial matching condition, upper bounds for Kapranov degrees and a characterization of their positivity. The positivity characterization answers a question of Silversmith and gives a new proof of Laman's theorem characterizing generically rigid graphs in the plane. We achieve this by proving a recursive formula for Kapranov degrees and by using tools from the theory of error correcting codes.

Our proof crucially uses the notion of prismatic F-gauges introduced by Drinfeld and Bhatt--Lurie and its relative version, and we give a self-contained treatment without using the stacky formulation.

We prove quantitative homogenization results for harmonic functions on supercritical continuum percolation clusters--that is, Poisson point clouds with edges connecting points which are closer than some fixed distance. We show that, on large scales, harmonic functions resemble harmonic functions in Euclidean space with sharp quantitative bounds on their difference. In particular, for every point cloud which is supercritical (meaning that the intensity of the Poisson process is larger than the critical parameter which guarantees the existence of an infinite connected component), we obtain optimal corrector bounds, homogenization error estimates and large-scale regularity results.

Extensions of Schoen--Simon--Yau and Schoen--Simon theorems via iteration à la De Giorgi

Journal-ref:
Inventiones Mathematicae vol. 240, n. 1 (2025)
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Differential Geometry (math.DG)
We give an alternative proof of the Schoen--Simon--Yau curvature estimates and associated Bernstein-type theorems (1975), and extend the original result by including the case of $6$-dimensional (stable minimal) immersions. The key step is an $\epsilon$-regularity theorem, that assumes smallness of the scale-invariant $L^2$ norm of the second fundamental form.
Further, we obtain a graph description, in the Lipschitz multi-valued sense, for any stable minimal immersion of dimension $n\geq 2$, that may have a singular set $\Sigma$ of locally finite $\mathcal{H}^{n-2}$-measure, and that is weakly close to a hyperplane. (In fact, if $\mathcal{H}^{n-2}(\Sigma)=0$, the conclusion is strengthened to a union of smooth graphs.) This follows directly from an $\epsilon$-regularity theorem, that assumes smallness of the scale-invariant $L^2$ tilt-excess (verified when the hypersurface is weakly close to a hyperplane). Specialising the multi-valued decomposition to the case of embeddings, we recover the Schoen--Simon theorem (1981).
In both $\epsilon$-regularity theorems the relevant quantity (respectively, length of the second fundamental form and tilt function) solves a non-linear PDE on the immersed minimal hypersurface. The proof is carried out intrinsically (without linearising the PDE) by implementing an iteration method à la De Giorgi (from the linear De Giorgi--Nash--Moser theory). Stability implies estimates (intrinsic weak Caccioppoli inequalities) that make the iteration effective despite the non-linear framework. (In both $\epsilon$-regularity theorems the method gives explicit constants that quantify the required smallness.)

The Duistermaat index and eigenvalue interlacing for self-adjoint extensions of a symmetric operator

Comments:
35 pages, 3 figures; added another application of the main results, streamlined some proofs, fixed typos; clarified monotonicity of general Cauchy data spaces
Subjects:
Spectral Theory (math.SP); Symplectic Geometry (math.SG)
Eigenvalue interlacing is a useful tool in linear algebra and spectral analysis. In its simplest form, the interlacing inequality states that a rank-one positive perturbation shifts each eigenvalue up, but not further than the next unperturbed eigenvalue. For different types of perturbations, this idea is known as Weyl interlacing, Cauchy interlacing, Dirichlet--Neumann bracketing and so on.
We prove a sharp version of the interlacing inequalities for ``finite-dimensional perturbations in boundary conditions'', expressed as bounds on the spectral shift between two self-adjoint extensions of a fixed symmetric operator with finite and equal defect numbers. The bounds are given in terms of the Duistermaat index, a topological invariant describing the relative position of three Lagrangian planes in a symplectic space. Two of the Lagrangian planes describe the self-adjoint extensions being compared, while the third corresponds to the Friedrichs extension, which acts as a reference point.
Along the way several auxiliary results are established, including one-sided continuity properties of the Duistermaat triple index, smoothness of the (abstract) Cauchy data space without unique continuation-type assumptions, and a formula for the Morse index of an extension of a non-negative symmetric operator.

Two-phase flows through porous media described by a Cahn--Hilliard--Brinkman model with dynamic boundary conditions

Journal-ref:
J. Evol. Equ., 24:85, 55 pp. (2024)
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
We investigate a new diffuse-interface model that describes creeping two-phase flows (i.e., flows exhibiting a low Reynolds number), especially flows that permeate a porous medium. The system of equations consists of a Brinkman equation for the volume averaged velocity field as well as a convective Cahn--Hilliard equation with dynamic boundary conditions for the phase-field, which describes the location of the two fluids within the domain. The dynamic boundary conditions are incorporated to model the interaction of the fluids with the wall of the container more precisely. In particular, they allow for a dynamic evolution of the contact angle between the interface separating the fluids and the boundary, and also for a convection-induced motion of the corresponding contact line. For our model, we first prove the existence of global-in-time weak solutions in the case where regular potentials are used in the Cahn--Hilliard subsystem. In this case, we can further show the uniqueness of the weak solution under suitable additional assumptions. Moreover, we further prove the existence of weak solutions in the case of singular potentials. Therefore, we regularize such singular potentials by a Yosida approximation, such that the results for regular potentials can be applied, and eventually pass to the limit in this approximation scheme.

We show, for all $n\ge 2$ even and $d\ge 2+\frac{4}{n}$, that the moduli of smooth degree $d$ hypersurfaces of $\mathbb{P}^{n+1}$ contains infinitely many different Hodge loci whose Zariski tangent space has the same codimension as the Hodge locus of linear cycles. We construct the Hodge cycles determining those Hodge loci as joins of $0$-dimensional cycles inside hypersurfaces of $\mathbb{P}^1$ with all their closed points defined over $\mathbb{Q}$. In order to analyze the cycle classes of these algebraic cycles, we establish a general formula for the cycle class of the join of any two algebraic cycles inside smooth hypersurfaces, expressed in terms of their periods. Furthermore, we prove that an algebraic cycle is a join of algebraic cycles, if and only if, its associated Artin Gorenstein algebra is the tensor product of the Artin Gorenstein algebras associated to each generating cycle.

Holomorphic Curves in Moduli Spaces Are Quasi-Isometrically Immersed

Geometric Topology (math.GT); Metric Geometry (math.MG)
A holomorphic curve in moduli spaces is the image of a non-constant holomorphic map from a hyperbolic surface $B$ of type $(g,n)$ to the moduli space $\mathcal{M}_h$ of closed Riemann surfaces of genus $h$. We show that, when all peripheral monodromies are of infinite order, the holomorphic map is a quasi-isometric immersion with parameters depending only on $g$, $n$, $h$ and the systole of $B$. When peripheral monodromies also satisfy an additional condition, we find a lift quasi-isometrically embedding a fundamental polygon of the hyperbolic surface $B$ into the Teichmüller space. We further improve the Parshin-Arakelov finiteness theorem, by proving that there are only finitely many monodromy homomorphisms induced by holomorphic curves of type $(g,n)$ in $\mathcal{M}_h$ where systole is bounded away from $0$, up to equivalence.

Thermo-Elasticity Problems with Evolving Microstructures
Michael Eden, Adrian Muntean
Comments:
31 pages
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
We consider the mathematical analysis and homogenization of a moving boundary problem posed for a highly heterogeneous, periodically perforated domain. More specifically, we are looking at a one-phase thermo-elasticity system with phase transformations where small inclusions, initially periodically distributed, are growing or shrinking based on a kinetic under-cooling-type law and where surface stresses are created based on the curvature of the phase interface. This growth is assumed to be uniform in each individual cell of the the perforated domain. After transforming to the initial reference configuration (utilizing the Hanzawa transformation), we use the contraction mapping principle to show the existence of a unique solution for a possibly small but $\varespilon$-independent time interval ($\varespilon$ is here the scale of heterogeneity). In the homogenization limit, we discover a macroscopic thermo-elasticity problem which is strongly non-linearly coupled (via an internal parameter called height function) to local changes in geometry. As a direct byproduct of the mathematical analysis work, we present an alternative equivalent formulation which lends itself to an effective precomputing strategy that is very much needed as the limit problem is computationally expensive.

First, we consider the case when the points lie on a curve of degree $d\le 3$, and the case when $r\le 8$. We then assume that the points are very general and show that $\varepsilon(X_r)\geq \frac{1}{2}$ if the Strong SHGH conjecture is true.

A symmetric ideal is an ideal in a polynomial ring which is stable under all permutations of the variables. In this paper we initiate a global study of zero-dimensional symmetric ideals. By this we mean a geometric study of the invariant Hilbert schemes $\mathrm{Hilb}_{\rho}^{S_n}(\mathbb{C}^n)$ parametrizing symmetric subschemes of $\mathbb{C}^n$ whose coordinate rings, as $S_n$-modules, are isomorphic to a given representation $\rho$. In the case that $\rho = M^\lambda$ is a permutation module corresponding to certain special types of partitions $\lambda$ of $n$, we prove that $\mathrm{Hilb}_{\rho}^{S_n}(\mathbb{C}^n)$ is irreducible or even smooth. We also prove irreducibility whenever $\dim \rho \leq 2n$ and the invariant Hilbert scheme is non-empty. In this same range, we classify all homogeneous symmetric ideals and decide which of these define singular points of $\mathrm{Hilb}_{\rho}^{S_n}(\mathbb{C}^n)$. A central tool is the combinatorial theory of higher Specht polynomials.

We characterize the simplicity of Pimsner algebras for non-proper C*-correspondences. With the aid of this criterion, we give a systematic strategy to produce outer actions of unitary tensor categories on Kirchberg algebras. In particular, every countable unitary tensor category admits an outer action on the Cuntz algebra $\mathcal{O}_2$. We also study the realizability of modules over fusion rings as K-groups of Kirchberg algebras acted on by unitary tensor categories, which turns out to be generically true for every unitary fusion category. Several new examples are provided, among which actions on Cuntz algebras of 3-cocycle twists of cyclic groups are constructed for all possible 3-cohomological classes, thereby answering a question asked by Izumi.

Can one condition a killed random walk to survive?
Lucas Rey, Augusto Teixeira
Comments:
37 pages, 2 figures
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
We consider the simple random walk on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ killed with probability $p(|x|)$ at site $x$ for a function $p$ decaying at infinity. Due to recurrence in dimension $d=2$, the killed random walk (KRW) dies almost surely if $p$ is positive, while in dimension $d \geq 3$ it is known that the KRW dies almost surely if and only if $\int_0^{\infty}rp(r)dr = \infty$, under mild technical assumptions on $p$. In this paper we consider, for any $d \geq 2$, functions $p$ for which the KRW dies almost surely and we ask ourselves if the KRW conditioned to survive is well-defined. More precisely, given an exhaustion $(\Lambda_R)_{R \in \mathbb{N}}$ of $\mathbb{Z}^d$, does the KRW conditioned to leave $\Lambda_R$ before dying converges in distribution towards a limit which does not depend on the exhaustion? We first prove that this conditioning is well-defined for $p(r) = o(r^{-2})$, and that it is not for $p(r) = \min(1, r^{-\alpha})$ for $\alpha \in (14/9,2)$. This question is connected to branching random walks and the infinite snake. More precisely, in dimension $d=4$, the infinite snake is related to the KRW with $p(r) \asymp (r^2\log(r))^{-1}$, therefore our results imply that the infinite snake conditioned to avoid the origin in four dimensions is well-defined.

The Feigin-Frenkel homomorphism underpinning the Wakimoto construction realises an affine Lie algebra at critical level in terms of the $\beta\gamma$-system of free fields. It was recently shown that much of the construction also goes through for double loop algebras. However, certain divergent sums appear. In this paper, we show that, suggestively, these sums vanish when one performs $\zeta$-function regularisation.

Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
Using the original advanced version of the direct method, we efficiently compute the equivalence groupoids and equivalence groups of two peculiar classes of Kolmogorov backward equations with power diffusivity and solve the problems of their complete group classifications. The results on the equivalence groups are double-checked with the algebraic method. Within these classes, the remarkable Fokker-Planck and the fine Kolmogorov backward equations are distinguished by their exceptional symmetry properties. We extend the known results on these two equations to their counterparts with respect to a nontrivial discrete equivalence transformation. Additionally, we carry out Lie reductions of the equations under consideration up to the point equivalence, exhaustively study their hidden Lie symmetries and generate wider families of their new exact solutions via acting by their recursion operators on constructed Lie-invariant solutions. This analysis reveals eight powers of the space variable with exponents -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 as values of the diffusion coefficient that are prominent due to symmetry properties of the corresponding equations.

Characterization of Equimatchable Even-Regular Graphs

Combinatorics (math.CO)
A graph is called equimatchable if all of its maximal matchings have the same size. Due to Eiben and Kotrbčík,, any connected graph with odd order and independence number $\alpha(G)$ at most $2$ is equimatchable. Akbari et al. showed that for any odd number $r$, a connected equimatchable $r$-regular graph must be either the complete graph $K_{r+1}$ or the complete bipartite graph $K_{r,r}$. They also determined all connected equimatchable $4$-regular graphs and proved that for any even $r$, any connected equimatchable $r$-regular graph is either $K_{r,r}$ or factor-critical. In this paper, we confirm that for any even $r\ge 6$, there exists a unique connected equimatchable $r$-regular graph $G$ with $\alpha(G)\geq 3$ and odd order.

Detachable pairs in $3$-connected matroids and simple $3$-connected graphs
Nick Brettell, Charles Semple, Gerry Toft
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
Let $M$ be a $3$-connected matroid. A pair $\{e,f\}$ in $M$ is detachable if $M \backslash e \backslash f$ or $M / e / f$ is $3$-connected. Williams (2015) proved that if $M$ has at least 13 elements, then at least one of the following holds: $M$ has a detachable pair, $M$ has a $3$-element circuit or cocircuit, or $M$ is a spike. We address the case where $M$ has a $3$-element circuit or cocircuit, to obtain a characterisation of when a matroid with at least 13 elements has a detachable pair. As a consequence, we characterise when a simple $3$-connected graph $G$ with $|E(G)| \ge 13$ has a pair of edges $\{e,f\}$ such that $G/e/f$ or $G \backslash e\backslash f$ is simple and $3$-connected.

Title:
Persistent Khovanov homology of tangles
Jian Liu, Li Shen, Guo-Wei Wei
Subjects:
Geometric Topology (math.GT)
Knot data analysis (KDA), which studies data with curve-type structures such as knots, links, and tangles, has emerging as a promising geometric topology approach in data science. While evolutionary Khovanov homology has been developed to analyze the global persistent topological features of links, it has limitations in capturing the local topological characteristics of knots and links. To address this challenge, we introduce the persistent Khovanov homology of tangles, providing a new mathematical framework for characterizing local features in curve-type data. While tangle homology is inherently abstract, we provide a concrete functor which maps the category of tangles to the category of modules, enabling the computation of tangle homology. Additionally, we employ planar algebra to construct a category of tangles without invoking fixed boundaries, thereby giving rise to a persistent Khovanov homology functor that enables practical applications. This framework provides a theoretical foundation and practical strategies for the topological analysis of curve-type data.

A Power Method for Computing Singular Value Decomposition
Doulaye Dembele
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
The singular value decomposition (SVD) allows to write a matrix as a product of a left singular vectors matrix, a nonnegative singular values diagonal matrix and a right singular vectors matrix. Among the applications of the SVD are the principal component analysis, the low-rank matrix approximation and the solving of a linear system of equations. The methods used for computing this decomposition allow to get the complete or partial result. For very large size matrix, the probabilistic methods allow to get partial result by using less computational load. A power method is proposed in this paper for computing all or the $k$ first largest SVD subspaces for a real-valued matrix. The $k$ first right singular vectors of this method are the $k$ columns of a neural network encoder weight matrix. The accuracy of this iterative search method depends on the behavior of the singular values and the settings of the gradient search optimizer used. A R package implementing the proposed method is available at this https URL.

In the decimal numeral system, we prove that the well-known Graham's number, $G := \! ^{n}3$ (i.e., $3^{3^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot^{3}}}}}$ ($n$ times)), and any base $3$ tetration whose hyperexponent is larger than $n$ share the same $\operatorname{slog}_3(G) - 1$ rightmost digits (where $\operatorname{slog}$ indicates the integer super-logarithm). This is an exact result since the $\operatorname{slog}_3(G)$-th rightmost digit of $G$ differs from the $\operatorname{slog}_3(G)$-th rightmost digit of $^{n+1}3$. Furthermore, we show that the $\operatorname{slog}_3(^{n}3)$-th least significant digit of the difference between Graham's number and any base $3$ tetration whose integer hyperexponent exceeds $n$ is $4$.

Coven and Meyerowitz formulated two conditions which have since been conjectured to characterize all finite sets that tile the integers by translation. By periodicity, this conjecture is reduced to sets which tile a finite cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}_M$. In this paper we consider a natural relaxation of this problem, where we replace sets with nonnegative functions $f,g$, such that $f(0)=g(0)=1$, $f\ast g=\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Z}_M}$ is a functional tiling, and $f, g$ satisfy certain further natural properties associated with tilings. We show that the Coven-Meyerowitz tiling conditions do not necessarily hold in such generality. Such examples of functional tilings carry the potential to lead to proper tiling counterexamples to the Coven-Meyerowitz conjecture in the future.

Enumeration of pattern-avoiding alternating sign matrices: An asymptotic dichotomy

Comments:

Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
We completely classify the asymptotic behavior of the number of alternating sign matrices classically avoiding a single permutation pattern, in the sense of [Johansson and Linusson 2007]. In particular, we give a uniform proof of an exponential upper bound for the number of alternating sign matrices classically avoiding one of eleven particular patterns, and a super-exponential lower bound for all other single-pattern avoidance classes. We also show that for any fixed integer $k$, there is an exponential upper bound for the number of alternating sign matrices that classically avoid any single permutation pattern and contain precisely $k$ negative ones. Finally, we prove that there must be at most $3$ negative ones in an alternating sign matrix which classically avoids both $2143$ and $3412$, and we exactly enumerate the number of them with precisely $3$ negative ones.

We removed the incorrect dependence on $d$ in Lemma 5.10. We clarified where the correct constant in Lemma 5.10 comes from by more clearly stating the constant in Proposition 5.8

In this paper we prove a reverse Hölder inequality for the variable exponent Muckenhoupt weights $\mathcal{A}_{p(\cdot)}$, introduced by the first author, Fiorenza, and Neugeabauer. All of our estimates are quantitative, showing the dependence of the exponent function on the $\mathcal{A}_{p(\cdot)}$ characteristic. As an application, we use the reverse Hölder inequality to prove that the matrix $\mathcal{A}_{p(\cdot)}$ weights, introduced in our previous paper, have both a right and left-openness property. This result is new even in the scalar case.

Scaling limit of first passage percolation geodesics on planar maps

Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
We establish the scaling limit of the geodesics to the root for the first passage percolation distance on random planar maps. We first describe the scaling limit of the number of faces along the geodesics. This result enables us to compare the metric balls for the first passage percolation and the dual graph distance. It also enables us to give an upper bound for the diameter of large random maps. Then, we describe the scaling limit of the tree of first passage percolation geodesics to the root via a stochastic coalescing flow of pure jump diffusions. Using this stochastic flow, we also construct some random metric spaces which we conjecture to be the scaling limits of random planar maps with high degrees. The main tool in this work is a time-reversal of the uniform peeling exploration.

Relaxation methods for pessimistic bilevel optimization

Comments:

Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
We consider a smooth pessimistic bilevel optimization problem, where the lower-level problem is convex and satisfies the Slater constraint qualification. These assumptions ensure that the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) reformulation of our problem is well-defined. We then introduce and study the (i) Scholtes, (ii) Lin and Fukushima, (iii) Kadrani, Dussault and Benchakroun, (iv) Steffensen and Ulbrich, and (v) Kanzow and Schwartz relaxation methods for the KKT reformulation of our pessimistic bilevel program. These relaxations have been extensively studied and compared for mathematical programs with complementatrity constraints (MPCCs). To the best of our knowledge, such a study has not been conducted for the pessimistic bilevel optimization problem, which is completely different from an MPCC, as the complemetatrity conditions are part of the objective function, and not in the feasible set of the problem. After introducing these relaxations, we provide convergence results for global and local optimal solutions, as well as suitable versions of the C- and M-stationarity points of our pessimistic bilevel optimization problem. Numerical results are also provided to illustrate the practical implementation of these relaxation algorithms, as well as some preliminary comparisons.

Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
Classical $(r,\delta)$-locally recoverable codes are designed for avoiding loss of information in large scale distributed and cloud storage systems. We introduce the quantum counterpart of those codes by defining quantum $(r,\delta)$-locally recoverable codes which are quantum error-correcting codes capable of correcting $\delta -1$ qudit erasures from sets of at most $r+ \delta -1$ qudits.
We give a necessary and sufficient condition for a quantum stabilizer code $Q(C)$ to be $(r,\delta)$-locally recoverable. Our condition depends only on the puncturing and shortening at suitable sets of both the symplectic self-orthogonal code $C$ used for constructing $Q(C)$ and its symplectic dual $C^{\perp_s}$. When $Q(C)$ comes from a Hermitian or Euclidean dual-containing code, and under an extra condition, we show that there is an equivalence between the classical and quantum concepts of $(r,\delta)$-local recoverability. A Singleton-like bound is stated in this case and examples attaining the bound are given.

If $G$ is a linearly reductive group acting rationally on a polynomial ring $S$, then the inclusion $S^{G} \hookrightarrow S$ possesses a unique $G$-equivariant splitting, called the Reynolds operator. We describe algorithms for computing the Reynolds operator for the classical actions as in Weyl's book. The groups are the general linear group, the special linear group, the orthogonal group, and the symplectic group, with their classical representations: direct sums of copies of the standard representation and copies of the dual representation.

A diffusion limit for Markov chains with log-linear interaction on a graph

Comments:
Minor revision. Title changed
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
In this paper we establish a diffusion limit for a multivariate continuous time Markov chain whose components are indexed by vertices of a finite graph. The components take values in a common finite set of non-negative integers and evolve subject to a graph based log-linear interaction. We show that if the set of common values of the components expands to the set of all non-negative integers, then a time-scaled and normalised version of the Markov chain converges to a system of interacting Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes reflected at the origin. This limit is akin to heavy traffic limits in queueing (and our model can be naturally interpreted as a queueing model). Our proof draws on developments in queueing theory and relies on martingale methods.

Channel Coding for Gaussian Channels with Mean and Variance Constraints
Adeel Mahmood, Aaron B. Wagner
Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT)
We consider channel coding for Gaussian channels with the recently introduced mean and variance cost constraints. Through matching converse and achievability bounds, we characterize the optimal first- and second-order performance. The main technical contribution of this paper is an achievability scheme which uses random codewords drawn from a mixture of three uniform distributions on $(n-1)$-spheres of radii $R_1, R_2$ and $R_3$, where $R_i = O(\sqrt{n})$ and $|R_i - R_j| = O(1)$. To analyze such a mixture distribution, we prove a lemma giving a uniform $O(\log n)$ bound, which holds with high probability, on the log ratio of the output distributions $Q_i^{cc}$ and $Q_j^{cc}$, where $Q_i^{cc}$ is induced by a random channel input uniformly distributed on an $(n-1)$-sphere of radius $R_i$. To facilitate the application of the usual central limit theorem, we also give a uniform $O(\log n)$ bound, which holds with high probability, on the log ratio of the output distributions $Q_i^{cc}$ and $Q^*_i$, where $Q_i^*$ is induced by a random channel input with i.i.d. components.

Geometric Topology (math.GT)
This paper proves the following two main results. First, we classify the isotopy classes of embeddings of $\Sigma$ in $\Sigma\times S^2$ that are geometrically dual to $\{\mbox{pt}\}\times S^2$, where $\Sigma$ is a closed oriented surface with a positive genus, and show that there exist infinitely many such embeddings that are homotopic to each other but mutually non-isotopic. This answers a question of Gabai. Second, we show that the space of symplectic forms on an irrational ruled surface homologous to a fixed symplectic form has infinitely many connected components. This gives the first such example among closed $4$--manifolds and answers Problem 2(a) in McDuff--Salamon's problem list. The proofs are based on a generalization of the Dax invariant to embedded closed surfaces. In the proof, we also establish several properties of the smooth mapping class group of $\Sigma\times S^2$, which may be of independent interest. For example, we show that there exists a surjective homomorphism from $\operatorname{MCG}(\Sigma\times S^2)$ to $\mathbb{Z}^\infty$, such that its restriction to the subgroup of elements pseudo-isotopic to the identity is also of infinite rank.

We examine pairs of closed plane curves that have the same closing property as two conic sections in Poncelet's porism. We show how the vertex curve can be computed for a given envelope and vice versa. Our formulas are universal in the sense that they produce all possible sufficiently regular pairs of such Poncelet curves. We arrive at similar results for sets of curves, analogous to the pencil of conic sections in the full Poncelet theorem. We also study the case of Poncelet curves that carry Poncelet polygons which are equiangular or even congruent.

A hybrid heuristic algorithm for the resource-constrained project scheduling problem
Evgenii Goncharov
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
This study presents a hybrid metaheuristic for the resource-constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP), which integrates a genetic algorithm (GA) and a neighborhood search strategy (NS). The RCPSP consists of a set of activities that follow precedence relationship and consume resources. The resources are renewable, and the amount of the resources is limited. The objective of RCPSP is to find a schedule of the activities to minimize the project makespan. The algorithm uses two crossovers in the GA and two neighborhoods in the NS, as well as a resource ranking heuristic. The computational results with instances from the PCPLIB library validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. We have obtained some of the best average deviations of the solutions from the critical path lower bound. The best heuristic solutions have been updated for some instances from PCPLIB.

A study of the Antlion Random Walk

Subjects:
Probability (math.PR); Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO)
Random walks (RWs) are fundamental stochastic processes with applications across physics, computer science, and information processing. A recent extension, the laser chaos decision-maker, employs chaotic time series from semiconductor lasers to solve multi-armed bandit (MAB) problems at ultrafast speeds, and its threshold adjustment mechanism has been modeled as an RW. However, previous analyses assumed complete memory preservation ($\alpha = 1$), overlooking the role of partial memory in balancing exploration and exploitation. In this paper, we introduce the Antlion Random Walk (ARW), defined by $X_t = \alpha X_{t-1} + \xi_t$ with $\alpha \in [0,1]$ and Rademacher-distributed increments $(\xi_t)$, which describes a walker pulled back toward the origin before each step. We show that varying $\alpha$ significantly alters ARW dynamics, yielding distributions that range from uniform-like to normal-like. Through mathematical and numerical analyses, we investigate expectation, variance, reachability, positive-side residence time, and distributional similarity. Our results place ARWs within the framework of autoregressive (AR(1)) processes while highlighting distinct non-Gaussian features, thereby offering new theoretical insights into memory-aware stochastic modeling of decision-making systems.

We discuss a model for phase transitions in which a double-well potential is singularly perturbed by possibly several terms involving different, arbitrarily high orders of derivation. We study by $\Gamma$-convergence the asymptotic behaviour as $\varepsilon\to 0$ of the functionals \begin{equation*}
F_\varepsilon(u):=\int_\Omega \Bigl[\frac{1}{\varepsilon}W(u)+\sum_{\ell=1}^{k}q_\ell\varepsilon^{2\ell-1}|\nabla^{(\ell)}u|_\ell^2\Bigr]\,dx, \qquad u\in H^k(\Omega), \end{equation*} for fixed $k>1$ integer, addressing also to the case in which the coefficients $q_1,...,q_{k-1}$ are negative and $|\cdot|_\ell$ is any norm on the space of symmetric $\ell$-tensors for each $\ell\in\{1,...,k\}$. The negativity of the coefficients leads to the lack of a priori bounds on the functionals; such issue is overcome by proving a nonlinear interpolation inequality. With this inequality at our disposal, a compactness result is achieved by resorting to the recent paper [10]. A further difficulty is the presence of general tensor norms which carry anisotropies, making standard slicing arguments not suitable. We prove that the $\Gamma$-limit is finite only on sharp interfaces and that it equals an anisotropic perimeter, with a surface energy density described by a cell formula.

Let $ (\Theta,T,\mu) $ be an ergodic topological dynamical system. The fibered rotation number for cocycles in $ \Theta\times \mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R}) $, acting on $ \Theta\times \mathbb{R}\mathbb{P}^1
$ is well-defined and has wide applications in the study of the spectral theory of Schrödinger operators. In this paper, we will provide its natural generalization for higher dimensional cocycles in $ \Theta\times\mathrm{SP}(2m,\mathbb{R}) $ or $ \Theta\times \mathrm{HSP}(2m,\mathbb{C}) $, where $ \mathrm{SP}(2m,\mathbb{R}) $ and $ \mathrm{HSP}(2m,\mathbb{C}) $ respectively refer to the $ 2m $-dimensional symplectic or Hermitian-symplectic matrices. As a corollary, we establish the equivalence between the integrated density of states for generalized Schrödinger operators and the fibered rotation number; and the Gap Labelling Theorem via the Schwartzman group, as expected from the one dimensional case [AS1983, JM1982].

In this text, we provide a positive answer to their question, that is, every $(p,t,a)$-inertial group is the finite monodromy group of an abelian variety in dimension $t+a$. To prove this, we show a structure theorem on the rational group algebra $\mathbf{Q}[G]$ of ramification groups, refining a theorem of Serre and generalizing results on $p$-groups of Roquette and Ford.

Stable fully discrete finite element methods with BGN tangential motion for Willmore flow of planar curves

Subjects:

We propose and analyze stable finite element approximations for Willmore flow of planar curves. The presented schemes are based on a novel weak formulation which combines an evolution equation for curvature with the curvature formulation originally proposed by Barrett, Garcke and Nürnberg (BGN) in \cite{BGN07}. Under discretization in space with piecewise linear elements this leads to a stable continuous-in-time semidiscrete scheme, which retains the equidistribution property from the BGN methods. Furthermore, two fully discrete schemes can be shown to satisfy unconditional energy stability estimates. Numerical examples are presented to showcase the good properties of the introduced schemes, including an asymptotic equidistribution of vertices.

We axiomatically derive a family of wavelets for an orientation score, lifting from position space $\mathbb{R}^2$ to position and orientation space $\mathbb{R}^2\times S^1$, with fast reconstruction property, that minimise position-orientation uncertainty. We subsequently show that these minimum uncertainty states are well-approximated by cake wavelets: for standard parameters, the uncertainty gap of cake wavelets is less than 1.1, and in the limit, we prove the uncertainty gap tends to the minimum of 1. Next, we complete a previous theoretical argument that one does not have to train the lifting layer in (PDE-)G-CNNs, but can instead use cake wavelets. Finally, we show experimentally that in this way we can reduce the network complexity and improve the interpretability of (PDE-)G-CNNs, with only a slight impact on the model's performance.

We design a recursive algorithm to compute the partition function of the Ising model, summed over cubic maps with fixed size and genus. The algorithm runs in polynomial time, which is much faster than methods based on a Tutte-like, or topological, recursion.
We construct this algorithm out of a partial differential equation that we derive from the first equation of the KP hierarchy satisfied by the generating function of bipartite maps. This series is indeed related to the Ising partition function by a change of variables. We also obtain inequalities on the coefficients of this partition function, which should be useful for a probabilistic study of cubic Ising maps whose genus grows linearly with their size.

We show how Langevin diffusions can be interpreted in the context of stochastic Hamiltonian systems with structure-preserving noise and dissipation on reductive Lie groups. Reductive Lie groups provide the setting in which the Lie group structure is compatible with Riemannian structures, via the existence of bi-invariant metrics. This structure allows for the explicit construction of Riemannian Brownian motion via symplectic techniques, which permits the study of Langevin diffusions with noise in the position coordinate as well as Langevin diffusions with noise in both momentum and position.

Cutoff for East models

Version with minor corrections, accepted for publication in Electronic Communications in Probability
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
We consider the East model in $\mathbb Z^d$, an example of a kinetically constrained interacting particle system with oriented constraints, together with one of its natural variant. Under any ergodic boundary condition it is known that the mixing time of the chain in a box of side $L$ is $\Theta(L)$ for any $d\ge 1$. Moreover, with minimal boundary conditions and at low temperature, i.e. low equilibrium density of the facilitating vertices, the chain exhibits cutoff around the mixing time of the $d=1$ case. Here we extend this result to high equilibrium density of the facilitating vertices. As in the low density case, the key tool is to prove that the speed of infection propagation in the $(1,1,\dots,1)$ direction is larger than $d$ $\times$ the same speed along a coordinate direction. By borrowing a technique from first passage percolation, the proof links the result to the precise value of the critical probability of oriented (bond or site) percolation in $\mathbb Z^d$.

It is well known that the spectral radius $\rho(T)$ of a tree $T$ with at least $3$ vertices has the property that $\frac 14\rho(T)^2+1<\Delta(T)\le \rho(T)^2$, where $\Delta(T)$ is the maximum degree of $T$. Let $\mathbb{P}$ denote the set of spectral radii of all non-trivial trees. In this article, we study the inverse problem that for any $\alpha\in \mathbb{P}$ and integer $r$ satisfying the condition $\frac 14\alpha^2+1<r\le \alpha^2$, is there a tree $T$ such that $\Delta(T)=r$ and $\rho(T)=\alpha$?
For any positive integer $r$ and positive number $\alpha$, let ${\mathscr W}_r(\alpha)$ denote a set of non-negative real numbers defined as follows: $\alpha\in {\mathscr W}_r(\alpha)$, and for any multi-set $\{q_i\in {\mathscr W}_r(\alpha): q_i>0, 1\le i\le s\}$, if $\beta:=\alpha-\sum\limits_{i=1}^sq_i^{-1}\ge 0$ and $s\le r-\left \lceil \frac{\beta}{\beta+1}\right\rceil$, then $\beta \in {\mathscr W}_r(\alpha)$. We first show that $0\in {\mathscr W}_r(\alpha)$ if and only if there exists a tree $T$ with $\Delta(T)\le r$ and $\rho(T)=\alpha$. It follows directly that $\mathbb{P}$ is exactly the set of positive numbers $\alpha$ such that $0\in {\mathscr W}_{\lfloor\alpha^2\rfloor}(\alpha)$. Applying this conclusion, we prove that for any two positive integers $r\ge 2$ and $k$, there exists a tree $T$ with $\Delta(T)=r$ and $\rho(T)=\sqrt k$ if and only if $\frac 14 k+1<r\le k$.

Transport alpha divergences

Comments:

Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
We derive a class of divergences measuring the difference between probability density functions on a one-dimensional sample space. This divergence is a one-parameter variation of the {Itakura--Saito} divergence between quantile density functions. We prove that the proposed divergence is one-parameter variation of transport Kullback-Leibler divergence and Hessian distance of negative Boltzmann entropy with respect to Wasserstein-2 metric. From Taylor expansions, we also formulate the $3$-symmetric tensor in Wasserstein space, which is given by an iterative Gamma three operators. The alpha-geodesic on Wasserstein space is also derived. From these properties, we name the proposed information measures transport alpha divergences. We provide several examples of transport alpha divergences for generative models in machine learning applications.

The e-Partitioning Principle of False Discovery Rate Control

Subjects:
Statistics Theory (math.ST)
We present a novel necessary and sufficient principle for False Discovery Rate (FDR) control. This e-Partitioning Principle says that a procedure controls FDR if and only if it is a special case of a general e-Partitioning procedure. By writing existing methods as special cases of this procedure, we can achieve uniform improvements of these methods, and we show this in particular for the eBH, BY and Su methods. We also show that methods developed using the $e$-Partitioning Principle have several valuable properties. They generally control FDR not just for one rejected set, but simultaneously over many, allowing post hoc flexibility for the researcher in the final choice of the rejected hypotheses. Under some conditions, they also allow for post hoc adjustment of the error rate, choosing the FDR level $\alpha$ post hoc, or switching to familywise error control after seeing the data. In addition, e-Partitioning allows FDR control methods to exploit logical relationships between hypotheses to gain power.

Removable sets for pseudoconvexity for weakly smooth boundaries
Quang Dieu Nguyen, Pascal J. Thomas
Comments:
Simplified proof of the result by Grauert & Remmert; various small corrections; 16 pages
Subjects:
Complex Variables (math.CV); Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
We show that for bounded domains in $\mathbb C^n$ with $\mathcal C^{1,1}$ smooth boundary, if there is a closed set $F$ of $2n-1$-Lebesgue measure $0$ such that $\partial \Omega \setminus F$ is $\mathcal C^{2}$-smooth and locally pseudoconvex at every point, then $\Omega$ is globally pseudoconvex. Unlike in the globally $\mathcal C^{2}$-smooth case, the condition ``$F$ of (relative) empty interior'' is not enough to obtain such a result. We also give some results under peak-set type hypotheses, which in particular provide a new proof of an old result of Grauert and Remmert about removable sets for pseudoconvexity under minimal hypotheses of boundary regularity.

On The Relative Cohomology For Algebraic Groups
Gabriel T. Loos
Subjects:
Group Theory (math.GR); Representation Theory (math.RT)
Let $G$ be an algebraic group over a field $k$, and $M$ and $N$ be $G$-modules. In 1961, Hochschild showed how one can define the cohomology groups $\text{Ext}_{G}^{i}(M,N)$. Kimura, in 1965, showed that one can generalize this to get relative cohomology for algebraic groups. The original cohomology groups play an important role in understanding the representation theory of $G$, but the role of relative cohomology is still not well understood.
In this paper the author expands upon the work of Kimura to prove foundational results about the relative cohomology. The author starts by giving the definitions of relative exact sequences and relative injective modules and proves a variety of basic properties for each that will be essential to define relative cohomology and obtain a relative Grothendieck spectral sequence. In particular, the induction functor will play an important role when studying the relative injective modules. Once the necessary ground work is laid, the definition of relative cohomology is given. Finally, it is stated when there is a relative Grothendieck spectral sequence, and many consequences and examples are provided.

The $k$th Order Preserving Sets and Isoperimetric Type Inequalities for Planar Ovals
Maksymilian Filip Safarewicz, Michał Zwierzyński
Comments:
28 pages, 9 figures
Subjects:
Differential Geometry (math.DG)
In this work, we introduce and investigate a new class of sets, the \textit{$k$th Order Preserving Sets}, arising naturally from the Fourier analysis of support functions associated with hedgehogs. Specifically, we focus on sets whose support functions possess a Fourier series that preserves only terms with positive indices divisible by a fixed $k$.
We explore the geometry of the \textit{$k$th Order Midpoint Set}, defined as the set of centroids of all equiangular $k$-gons circumscribed about a given hedgehog. This set captures essential structural and symmetry-related features of the underlying geometric configuration.
We study the geometric properties of such sets and, in particular, establish an isoperimetric-type inequality relating the perimeter and area of a region bounded by a simple smooth convex closed curve (an oval) $\mathcal{O}$: \[ L_{\mathcal{O}}^2 - 4\pi A_{\mathcal{O}} \geqslant 4\pi |A_{\mathcal{P}_k}| + 2\pi |A_{\Omega_{\mathcal{O},k}}|, \] where $L_{\mathcal{O}}$ denotes the length (perimeter) of $\mathcal{O}$, $A_{\mathcal{O}}$ is the area of the region enclosed by $\mathcal{O}$, $A_{\mathcal{P}_k}$ is the oriented area of the associated $k$th Order Preserving Set $\mathcal{P}_k$, and $A_{\Omega_{\mathcal{O},k}}$ is the oriented area of the associated $k$th Order Midpoint Set $\Omega_{\mathcal{O},k}$. Moreover, we characterize the equality case: the inequality becomes an equality if and only if every equiangular circumscribed $k$-gon around $\mathcal{O}$ is a~regular $k$-gon with its center of mass located at the Steiner point of $\mathcal{O}$.

This paper reformulates Goodwillie calculus of $\infty$-categories including non-presentable $\infty$-categories. In the case of presentable $\infty$-categories our definition is equivalent to Heuts's~\cite{Heuts2018} work.
As an application of this work, we prove that, for any perfectoid algebra, the tilting functor induces a weak equivalence of the left Kan extensions algebraic cobordisms on the category of non-unital algebras.
Furthermore, we give a theory of approximation of functors along given natural transformation of them, and applications to the algebraic cobordism to the $K$-theory.

On Isotropy Groups of Quantum Plane

Subjects:
Rings and Algebras (math.RA)
This paper investigates the isotropy groups of derivations on the Quantum Plane $\Bbbk_q[x, y]$, defined by the relation $yx = qxy$, where $q \in \Bbbk^*$, with $q^2\neq 1$. The main goal is to determine the automorphisms of the Quantum Plane that commutes with a fixed derivation $\delta$. We describe conditions under which the isotropy group $\text{Aut}_\delta(A)$ is trivial, finite, or infinite, depending on the structure of $\delta$ and whether $q$ is a root of unity: additionally, we present the structure of the group in the finite case. A key tool is the analysis of polynomial equations of the form $\mu_1^a \mu_2^b = 1$, arising from monomials in the inner part of $\delta$. We also make explicit which finite subgroups of $Aut(\Bbbk_q[x, y])$ are isotropy groups of some derivation: either $q$ root of unity or not. Techniques from algebraic geometry, such as intersection multiplicity, are also employed in the classification of the finite case.

A Modern Theory of Cross-Validation through the Lens of Stability
Jing Lei
Comments:
130 pages, 1 figure
Subjects:
Statistics Theory (math.ST)
Modern data analysis and statistical learning are marked by complex data structures and black-box algorithms. Data complexity stems from technologies like imaging, remote sensing, wearables, and genomic sequencing. Simultaneously, black-box models -- especially deep neural networks -- have achieved impressive results. This combination raises new challenges for uncertainty quantification and statistical inference, which we term "black-box inference."
Black-box inference is difficult due to the lack of traditional modeling assumptions and the opaque behavior of modern estimators. These make it hard to characterize the distribution of estimation errors. A popular solution is post-hoc randomization, which, under mild assumptions like exchangeability, can yield valid uncertainty quantification. Such methods range from classical techniques like permutation tests, jackknife, and bootstrap, to recent innovations like conformal inference. These approaches typically need little knowledge of data distributions or the internal working of estimators. Many rely on the idea that estimators behave similarly under small data changes -- a concept formalized as stability. Over time, stability has become a key principle in data science, influencing generalization error, privacy, and adaptive inference.
This article investigates cross-validation (CV) -- a widely used resampling method -- through the lens of stability. We first review recent theoretical results on CV for estimating generalization error and model selection under stability. We then examine uncertainty quantification for CV-based risk estimates. Together, these insights yield new theory and tools, which we apply to topics like model selection, selective inference, and conformal prediction.

Efficient Quadratic Corrections for Frank-Wolfe Algorithms
Jannis Halbey, Seta Rakotomandimby, Mathieu Besançon, Sébastien Designolle, Sebastian Pokutta
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
We develop a Frank-Wolfe algorithm with corrective steps, generalizing previous algorithms including blended conditional gradients, blended pairwise conditional gradients, and fully-corrective Frank-Wolfe. For this, we prove tight convergence guarantees together with an optimal face identification property. Furthermore, we propose two highly efficient corrective steps for convex quadratic objectives based on linear optimization or linear system solving, akin to Wolfe's minimum-norm point, and show that they converge in finite time under suitable conditions. Beyond optimization problems that are directly quadratic, we revisit two algorithms - split conditional gradient and second-order conditional gradient sliding - which can leverage quadratic corrections to accelerate their quadratic subproblems. We demonstrate improved convergence rates for the first and broader applicability for the second, which may be of independent interest. Finally, we show substantial computational speedups for Frank-Wolfe-based algorithms with quadratic corrections across the considered problem classes.

This survey synthesizes the principal descriptive set-theoretic perspectives on deterministic Cantor sets on the real line and charts directions for future study. After recounting their historical genesis and compiling an up-to-date taxonomy, we review the Borel hierarchy and four hierarchically ordered representations-general, nested, iterated-function-system (IFS), and q-ary expansion-presented from the most general to the most specific set-theoretic description of deterministic Cantor sets. We then present explicit and recursive descriptions for two thin families of measure-zero Cantor sets and an augmented "tick" family of positive measure, respectively, showing that the classical middle-third set lies in the intersection of all three families of after-mentioned Cantor sets. The survey closes by isolating several open problems in four directions, aiming to provide mathematicians with a coherent platform for further descriptive set-theoretic investigations into Cantor-type sets on the real line.

Stochastic Processes and Diffusion Equations
Helder Rojas
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
In these lecture notes, we explore the mathematical preliminaries and foundational concepts that connect stochastic processes with partial differential equations. We begin by investigating Brownian motion, which serves as a model for random fluctuations and is deeply connected to the heat equation. This connection forms the basis for understanding diffusion phenomena, where the probability distribution of Brownian motion evolves according to the heat equation over time. To extend this classical result to more general stochastic systems, we introduce the Itô calculus, a powerful framework that allows us to analyze processes driven by both deterministic drift and stochastic fluctuations. This mathematical tool is essential for understanding the dynamics of more complex diffusion processes, where randomness is no longer purely Brownian, but also depends on the underlying system's state. Building on these concepts, we turn to the study of diffusion processes, which generalize Brownian motion by incorporating the Fokker-Planck equation. This equation describes how the probability density of a diffusion process evolves over time and serves as an extension of the heat equation to more complex stochastic systems. By using Itô calculus, we can rigorously study how these processes behave and connect the microscopic randomness of individual particles to their macroscopic description via partial differential equations.

The classical Floquet theory allows to map a time-periodic system of linear differential equations into an autonomous one. By looking at it in a geometrical way, we extend the theory to a class of non-autonomous non-periodic equations. This is obtained by considering a change of variables which depends on time in a non-trivial way, i.e. introducing gauge transformations, well known in fundamental Physics and Field Theory -- but which seems to have received little attention in this context.

Exact worst-case convergence rates for Douglas--Rachford and Davis--Yin splitting methods

Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
In this work, we aim to establish the exact worst-case convergence rates of Douglas--Rachford splitting (DRS) and Davis--Yin splitting (DYS) when applied to convex optimization problems. Both DRS and DYS have two variants as swapping the roles of the two nonsmooth convex functions in both algorithms yields different sequences of iterates. For both variants of DRS and one variant of DYS, we establish the exact worst-case convergence rates, including the constant factor, using the primal--dual gap function as the performance metric. We provide worst-case examples to verify the tightness of these rates. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result that establishes the exact worst-case convergence rates for DRS and DYS that include the constant factor. For the other variant of DYS, we establish the best-known convergence rate and provide a concrete example indicating a discrepancy between the convergence rates of the two DYS variants.

Physical Space Proof of Bilinear Estimates and Applications to Nonlinear Dispersive Equations (II)

Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
The work by Kenig-Ponce-Vega [15] initiated the use of Bourgain spaces to study the low-regularity well-posedness of semilinear dispersive equations. Since then, the Bourgain space method has become the dominant, and almost the only method to deal with this problem. The goal of this series of papers is to propose an alternative approach for this problem that does not rely on Bourgain spaces. Our method is based on a bilinear estimate, which is proved in a physical space approach by a new div-curl type lemma introduced by the third author. Combining these ingredients with a Strichartz estimate of mixed spatial integrability, we will illustrate our method in the present paper by reproducing best known local well-posedness results for the 2d and 3d Zakharov system from Bejenaru-Herr-Holmer-Tataru [2] and Bejenaru-Herr [1].

Enhanced noise sensitivity, 2D directed polymers and Stochastic Heat Flow

Comments:

Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
We investigate noise sensitivity beyond the classical setting of binary random variables, extending the celebrated result by Benjamini, Kalai, and Schramm to a wide class of functions of general random variables. Our approach yields improved bounds with optimal rates. We also consider an enhanced form of noise sensitivity which yields asymptotic independence, rather than mere decorrelation.
We apply these result to establish enhanced noise sensitivity for the partition functions of 2D directed polymers, in the critical regime where they converge to the critical 2D Stochastic Heat Flow. As a consequence, we prove that the Stochastic Heat Flow is independent of the white noise arising from the disorder.

Primes in Arithmetic Progressions to Large Moduli and Siegel Zeroes

Let $\chi$ be a Dirichlet character mod $D$ with $L(s,\chi)$ its associated $L$-function, and let $\psi(x,q,a)$ be Chebyshev's prime-counting function for primes congruent to $a$ modulo $q$. We show that under the assumption of an exceptional character $\chi$ with $L(1,\chi)=o\left((\log D)^{-5}\right)$, for any $q<x^{\frac 23-\varepsilon}$, the asymptotic $$\psi(x,q,a)=\frac{\psi(x)}{\phi(q)}\left(1-\chi\left(\frac{aD}{(D,q)}\right)+o(1)\right)$$ holds for almost all $a$ with $(a,q)=1$. We also find that for any fixed $a$, the above holds for almost all $q<x^{\frac 23-\varepsilon}$ with $(a,q)=1$. Previous prime equidistribution results under the assumption of Siegel zeroes (by Friedlander-Iwaniec and the current author) have found that the above asymptotic holds either for all $a$ and $q$ or on average over a range of $q$ (i.e. for the Elliott-Halberstam conjecture), but only under the assumption that $q<x^{\theta}$ where $\theta=\frac{30}{59}$ or $\frac{16}{31}$, respectively.

Electricity Price-Aware Scheduling of Data Center Cooling
Arash Khojaste, Jonathan Pearce, Golbon Zakeri, Yuanrui Sang
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
Data centers are becoming a major consumer of electricity on the grid, with cooling accounting for about 40\% of that energy. As electricity prices vary throughout the day and year, there is a need for cooling strategies that adapt to these fluctuations to reduce data center cooling costs. In this paper, we present a model for electricity price-aware cooling scheduling using a Markov Decision Process(MDP) framework to reliably estimate the cooling system operational costs and facilitate investment-phase decision-making. We utilize Quantile Fourier Regression (QFR) fits to classify electricity prices into different regimes while capturing both daily and seasonal patterns. We simulate 14 years of operation using historical electricity price and outdoor temperature data, and compare our model against heuristic baselines. The results demonstrate that our approach consistently achieves lower cooling costs. This model is useful for grid operators interested in demand response programs and data center investors looking to make investment decisions.

We study $L^2$ to $L^p$ operator norms of spectral projectors for the Euclidean Laplacian on the torus in the case where the spectral window is narrow. With a window of constant size this is a classical result of Sogge; in the small-window limit we are left with $L^p$ norms of eigenfunctions of the Laplacian, as considered for instance by Bourgain. For the three-dimensional torus we prove new cases of a previous conjecture of the first two authors concerning the size of these norms; we also refine certain prior results to remove $\epsilon$-losses in all dimensions. We use methods from number theory: the geometry of numbers, the circle method and exponential sum bounds due to Guo. We complement these techniques with height splitting and a bilinear argument to prove sharp results.
We exposit on the various techniques used and their limitations.

Numerical Analysis (math.NA); Signal Processing (eess.SP)
Precoding matrix construction is a key element of the wireless signal processing using the multiple-input and multiple-output model. It is established that the problem of global throughput optimization under per-antenna power constraints belongs, in general, to the class of monotonic optimization problems, and is unsolvable in real-time. The most widely used real-time baseline is the suboptimal solution of Zero-Forcing, which achieves a cubic complexity by discarding the background noise coefficients. This baseline, however, is not readily adapted to per-antenna power constraints, and performs poorly if background noise coefficients are not negligible. In this paper, we are going to present a computational algorithm which constructs a precoder that is SINR multiobjective Pareto-optimal under per-antenna power constraints - with a complexity that differs from that of Zero-Forcing only by a constant factor. The algorithm has a set of input parameters, changing which skews the importance of particular user throughputs: these parameters make up an efficient parameterization of the entire Pareto boundary.

Sensitivity of Filter Kernels and Robustness Bounds to Transition and Measurement Kernel Perturbations in Partially Observable Stochastic Control
Yunus Emre Demirci, Ali Devran Kara, Serdar Yüksel
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
Studying the stability of partially observed Markov decision processes (POMDPs) with respect to perturbations in either transition or observation kernels is a significant problem. While asymptotic robustness/stability results as approximate transition kernels and/or measurement kernels converge to the true ones have been previously reported, studies on explicit bounds on value differences and mismatch costs have been limited in scope for POMDPs. In this paper, we provide such explicit bounds under both discounted and average cost criteria. To this end, and also as an independent contribution, we first study the perturbations induced on the filter kernels (that is, the kernels of the belief-MDP reduction of POMDPs) as the transition and measurement kernels are perturbed. The bounds are given in terms of Wasserstein and total variation distances between the original and approximate transition and observation kernels. We then show that control policies optimized for approximate models yield performance guarantees when applied to the true model with explicit bounds. As a particular application, we consider the case where the state space and the measurement spaces are quantized to obtain finite models, and we obtain explicit error bounds which decay to zero as the approximations get finer. This provides explicit performance guarantees for model reduction in POMDPs.

An Explicit Cohen-Style Threefield Identity
Lucas Perryman-Deskins
Subjects:
Number Theory (math.NT)
In 1988, Andrews, Dyson, and Hickerson showed that a $q$-series $\sigma$ found in Ramanujan's lost notebook and related to partitions could be interpreted as counting ideals in $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{6})$, and found similar formulas for $\sigma$ in terms of ideals of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})$ and $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3})$. Cohen followed this by showing more generally that for certain triples of quadratic fields, there is abelian extension and conductor so that the ray class character theta series for all three fields coincide. In the intervening years, several $q$-series counting ideals in quadratic fields have been explored, nearly all relating to the fields explored by Andrews et al. In this paper we give an example of a ray class character theta series which stems from $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-6})$, $\mathbb{Q}(i)$, and $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{6})$. We use recent work of Okano to give explicit formulas via quadratic form theta series with congruence conditions stemming from each field. We isolate an analogue of $\sigma$ for this series and show that it has coefficients also given by a partition generating function.

Combinatorial and Gaussian Foundations of Rational Nth Root Approximations: Theorems and Conjectures
Isaac Wolford
Comments:
Pages: 25
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
We present an approach (the biroot method) for nth root approximation that yields closed-form rational functions with coefficients derived from binomial structures, Gaussian functions, or qualifying DAG structures. The method emerges from an analysis of Newton's method applied to root extraction, revealing that successive iterations generate coefficients following rows of Pascal's triangle in an alternating numerator-denominator pattern. After further exploration of these patterns, we formulate three main conjectures: (1) the Binomial Biroot Conjecture establishing the fundamental alternating coefficient structure to approximate nth roots (for which we prove the square root case and optimal parameter conditions), (2) the Gaussian Biroot Conjecture, and (3) the General DAG Biroot Conjecture showing a structural invariance to nth root approximation using arbitrary linearly-constructed directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Computational evidence demonstrates superior convergence properties when compared to Taylor series and Padé approximations, especially considering the more direct and less computationally intensive approach to the biroot function construction. A computational framework has been developed to support systematic exploration of the biroot method's parameter space and to enable extensive numerical and symbolic analysis. The method provides both theoretical insights and computational significance by connecting combinatorial structures to nth root rational approximation theory.

Nontrivial Solutions to a Cubic Identity and the Factorization of $n^2+n+1$
Hajrudin Fejzić
Subjects:
General Mathematics (math.GM)
We investigate a variation of Nicomachus's identity in which one term in the cubic sum is replaced by a different cube. Specifically, we study the Diophantine identity \[ \sum_{j=1}^{n} j^3 + x^3 - k^3 = \left( \sum_{j=1}^{n} j + x - k \right)^2 \] and classify all integer solutions $(k,x,n)$. A full parametric family of nontrivial solutions was introduced in a 2005 paper, along with a conjectural condition for when such solutions exist. We provide a complete proof of this characterization and show it is equivalent to a structural condition on the prime factorization of $ n^2 + n + 1 $.
Our argument connects this identity to classical results in the theory of binary quadratic forms. In particular, we analyze the equation $a^2 + ab + b^2 = n^2 + n + 1$, interpreting it as a norm in the ring of Eisenstein integers $\mathbb{Z}[\omega]$, where $\omega = \frac{1 + \sqrt{-3}}{2}$. This yields a surprising connection between a modified combinatorial identity and the arithmetic of algebraic number fields.

Comparing Left and Right Quotient Sets in Groups

For a finite subset $A$ of a group $G$, we define the right quotient set and the left quotient set of $A$, respectively, as $AA^{-1} := \{a_1a_2^{-1}:a_1,a_2\in A\}$, $A^{-1}A := \{a_1^{-1}a_2:a_1,a_2\in A\}$. While the right and left quotient sets are equal if $G$ is abelian, subtleties arise when $G$ is a nonabelian group, where the cardinality difference $|AA^{-1}| - |A^{-1}A|$ may be take on arbitrarily large values. Using the results of Martin and O'Bryant on the cardinality differences of sum sets and difference sets in $\mathbb{Z}$, we prove in the infinite dihedral group, $D_\infty \cong \mathbb{Z} \rtimes \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$, every integer difference is achievable. Further, we prove that in $F_2$, the free group on $2$ generators, an integer difference is achievable if and only if that integer is even, and we explicitly construct subsets of $F_2$ that achieve every even integer. We further determine the minimum cardinality of $A \subset G$ so that the difference between the cardinalities of the left and right quotient sets is nonzero, depending on the existence of order $2$ elements in $G$. To prove these results, we construct difference graphs $D_A$ and $D_{A^{-1}}$ which encode equality, respectively, in the right and left quotient sets. We observe a bijection from edges in $D_A$ to edges in $D_{A^{-1}}$ and count connected components in order to obtain our results on cardinality differences $|AA^{-1}| - |A^{-1}A|$.

Recognizing flag varieties and reductive groups

Subjects:
Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)
Fix a flat and projective morphism $X\rightarrow\Sigma$ of schemes. We show, first, that any set of $\mathbb{P}^1$-fibrations on $X$ defines a set of simple roots, a set of simple coroots and a Cartan matrix $C$. Second, $X$ is an étale $F$-bundle over some projective $\Sigma$-scheme, where $F$ is the flag variety of the adjoint Chevalley group over the integers defined by $C$. In particular, if the simple roots generate the Néron--Severi group of $X$ relative to $\Sigma$ and $X$ is cohomologically flat in degree zero over $\Sigma$ then $X$ is a form of $F$. When $X$ is a smooth Fano variety over the complex numbers all of whose extremal rays are accounted for by these fibrations this is due to Occhetta, Solá-Conde, Watanabe and Wiśniewski. Third, we recover, in a uniform way, the isomorphism and isogeny theorems of Chevalley and Demazure: over any base a pinned reductive group is determined by its pinned root datum, and a $p$-morphism of pinned root data determines a unique homomorphism of the corresponding groups.

Quadrature Domains and the Faber Transform

We present a framework for reconstructing any simply connected, bounded or unbounded, quadrature domain $\Omega$ from its quadrature function $h$. Using the Faber transform, we derive formulae directly relating $h$ to the Riemann map for $\Omega$. Through this approach, we obtain a complete classification of one point quadrature domains with complex charge. We proceed to develop a theory of weighted quadrature domains with respect to weights of the form $\rho_a(w)=|w|^{2(a-1)}$ when $a > 0$ ("power-weighted" quadrature domains) and the limiting case of when $a=0$ ("log-weighted" quadrature domains). Furthermore, we obtain Faber transform formulae for reconstructing weighted quadrature domains from their respective quadrature functions. Several examples are presented throughout to illustrate this approach both in the simply connected setting and in the presence of rotational symmetry.

We study jet schemes of Newton non-degenerate plane curve singularities. We identify a subgraph of the graph of jet components and show that it can be constructed from walks on the lattice points in the first quadrant of the Cartesian plane. In particular, we determine all the irreducible components of the jet schemes. Furthermore, we prove that this subgraph encodes the embedded topological type of the curve singularity in the plane. Finally, we introduce a generating series defined in terms of the irreducible components of the jet schemes and their (co-)dimensions, and we prove that this series is rational and explicitly determine its poles.

Diffusion-Shock PDEs for Deep Learning on Position-Orientation Space

Invited to the Journal of Mathematical Imaging and Vision Special Issue on Scale Space and Variational Methods in Computer Vision 2025 (SSVM)
Subjects:
Differential Geometry (math.DG)
We extend Regularised Diffusion-Shock (RDS) filtering from Euclidean space R2 [1] to position-orientation space $\mathbb{M}_2 \cong \mathbb{R}^2 \times S^1$. This has numerous advantages, e.g. making it possible to enhance and inpaint crossing structures, since they become disentangled when lifted to $\mathbb{M}_2$. We create a version of the algorithm using gauge frames to mitigate issues caused by lifting to a finite number of orientations. This leads us to study generalisations of diffusion, since the gauge frame diffusion is not generated by the Laplace-Beltrami operator. RDS filtering compares favourably to existing techniques such as Total Roto-Translational Variation (TR-TV) flow, NLM, and BM3D when denoising images with crossing structures, particularly if they are segmented. Furthermore, we see that $\mathbb{M}_2$ RDS inpainting is indeed able to restore crossing structures, unlike $\mathbb{R}^2$ RDS inpainting. In addition to the contributions of our SSVM submission "Diffusion-Shock Filtering on the Space of Positions and Orientations", in this extended work we provide new theorical results and automate RDS filtering by integrating it into a geometric deep learning framework. Regarding our theoretical contributions, we prove that our generalised diffusions are still well-posed, smoothing, and analytic. We developed an RDS filtering PDE layer for the PDE-CNN and PDE-G-CNN deep learning frameworks, using a novel gating mechanism. We show that these new RDS PDE layers can be beneficial in various impainting and denoising tasks.

$p$-adic Higher Green's Functions for Stark-Heegner Cycles
Hazem Hassan
Subjects:
Number Theory (math.NT)
Heegner cycles are higher weight analogues of Heegner points. Their arithmetic intersection numbers also appear as Fourier coefficients of modular forms and often belong to abelian extensions of imaginary-quadratic fields. Rotger and Seveso propose a precise recipe for the $p$-adic Abel-Jacobi images of cycle classes whose existence is predicted by conjectures of Bloch and Beilinson and which would be a real-quadratic analogue to Heegner cycles: the Stark-Heegner cycles of the title.
In this paper, we generalize Darmon-Vonk's theory of rigid meromorphic cocycles to higher weight, producing a higher Green's pairing of real-quadratic divisors on the $p$-adic upper half-plane, which seems to be the real-quadratic analogue of the pairing of Heegner cycles. Computation of these values for "principal cycles'' gives evidence that they lie in abelian extensions of real-quadratic fields. The algebraicity of certain values of the higher Green's function is indirect evidence for the existence of algebraic Stark-Heegner cycles.

On Regression in Extreme Regions

Subjects:

We establish a statistical learning theoretical framework aimed at extrapolation, or out-of-domain generalization, on the unobserved tails of covariates in continuous regression problems. Our strategy involves performing statistical regression on a subsample of observations with continuous labels that are the furthest away from the origin, focusing specifically on their angular components. The underlying assumptions of our approach are grounded in the theory of multivariate regular variation, a cornerstone of extreme value theory. We address the stylized problem of nonparametric least squares regression with predictors chosen from a Vapnik-Chervonenkis class.
This work contributes to a broader initiative to develop statistical learning theoretical foundations for supervised learning strategies that enhance performance on the supposedly heavy tails of covariates. Previous efforts in this area have focused exclusively on binary classification on extreme covariates. Although the continuous target setting necessitates different techniques and regularity assumptions, our main results echo findings from earlier studies. We quantify the predictive performance on tail regions in terms of excess risk, presenting it as a finite sample risk bound with a clear bias-variance decomposition. Numerical experiments with simulated and real data illustrate our theoretical findings.

Monoid Theory in Alonzo: A Little Theories Formalization in Simple Type Theory
William M. Farmer, Dennis Y. Zvigelsky
Comments:

Subjects:
Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO); Logic (math.LO)
Alonzo is a practice-oriented classical higher-order version of predicate logic that extends first-order logic and that admits undefined expressions. Named in honor of Alonzo Church, Alonzo is based on Church's type theory, Church's formulation of simple type theory. The little theories method is a method for formalizing mathematical knowledge as a theory graph consisting of theories as nodes and theory morphisms as directed edges. The development of a mathematical topic is done in the "little theory" in the theory graph that has the most convenient level of abstraction and the most convenient vocabulary, and then the definitions and theorems produced in the development are transported, as needed, to other theories via the theory morphisms in the theory graph.
The purpose of this paper is to illustrate how a body of mathematical knowledge can be formalized in Alonzo using the little theories method. This is done by formalizing monoid theory -- the body of mathematical knowledge about monoids -- in Alonzo. Instead of using the standard approach to formal mathematics in which mathematics is done with the help of a proof assistant and all details are formally proved and mechanically checked, we employ an alternative approach in which everything is done within a formal logic but proofs are not required to be fully formal. The standard approach focuses on certification, while this alternative approach focuses on communication and accessibility.

Schwinger-Keldysh non-perturbative field theory of open quantum systems beyond the Markovian regime: Application to spin-boson and spin-chain-boson models

We develop a unified framework for open quantum systems composed of many mutually interacting quantum spins, or any isomorphic systems like qubits and qudits, surrounded by one or more independent bosonic baths. Our framework, based on Schwinger-Keldysh field theory (SKFT), can handle arbitrary spin value S, dimensionality of space, and geometry, while being applicable to a large parameter space for system and bath or their coupling. It can probe regimes in which non-Markovian dynamics and nonperturbative effects pose formidable challenges for other state-of-the-art theoretical methods. This is achieved by working with the two-particle irreducible (2PI) effective action, which resums classes of Feynman diagrams of SKFT to an infinite order. Furthermore, such diagrams are generated via an expansion in 1/N, where N is the number of Schwinger bosons we employ to map spin operators onto canonically commuting ones, rather than via conventional expansion in system-bath coupling constant. We carefully benchmark our SKFT+2PI-computed results vs. numerically (quasi)exact ones from tensor network calculations applied to the archetypical spin-boson model where both methodologies are applicable. Additionally, we demonstrate the capability of SKFT+2PI to handle a much more complex spin-chain-boson model with multiple baths interacting with each spin where no benchmark from other methods is available at present. The favorable numerical cost of solving integro-differential equations produced by the SKFT+2PI framework with an increasing number of spins and time steps makes it a promising route for simulating driven-dissipative systems in quantum computing, quantum magnonics, and quantum spintronics.

Slaves to the Law of Large Numbers: An Asymptotic Equipartition Property for Perplexity in Generative Language Models

Subjects:
Computation and Language (cs.CL); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Information Theory (cs.IT)
We prove a new asymptotic un-equipartition property for the perplexity of long texts generated by a language model and present supporting experimental evidence from open-source models. Specifically we show that the logarithmic perplexity of any large text generated by a language model must asymptotically converge to the average entropy of its token distributions. This defines a ``typical set'' that all long synthetic texts generated by a language model must belong to. We refine the concept of ''typical set'' to include only grammatically correct texts. We then show that this refined typical set is a vanishingly small subset of all possible grammatically correct texts for a very general definition of grammar. This means that language models are strongly constrained in the range of their possible behaviors and outputs. We make no simplifying assumptions (such as stationarity) about the statistics of language model outputs, and therefore our results are directly applicable to practical real-world models without any approximations. We discuss possible applications of the typical set concept to problems such as detecting synthetic texts and membership inference in training datasets.

This report addresses the maximum likelihood identification of models for offset-free model predictive control, where linear time-invariant models are augmented with (fictitious) uncontrollable integrating modes, called integrating disturbances. The states and disturbances are typically estimated with a Kalman filter. The disturbance estimates effectively provide integral control, so the quality of the disturbance model (and resulting filter) directly influences the control performance. We implement eigenvalue constraints to protect against undesirable filter behavior (unstable or marginally stable modes, high-frequency oscillations). Specifically, we consider the class of linear matrix inequality (LMI) regions for eigenvalue constraints. These LMI regions are open sets by default, so we introduce a barrier function method to create tightened, but closed, eigenvalue constraints. To solve the resulting nonlinear semidefinite program, we approximate it as a nonlinear program using a Cholesky factorization method that exploits known sparsity structures of semidefinite optimization variables and matrix inequalities. The algorithm is applied to real-world data taken from two physical systems: a low-cost benchmark temperature microcontroller suitable for classroom laboratories, and an industrial-scale chemical reactor at Eastman Chemical's plant in Kingsport, TN.

This paper addresses the sparse actuation problem for nonlinear systems represented in the Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) form. We propose a convex optimization framework that concurrently determines actuator magnitude limits and the state-feedback law that guarantees a user-specified closed-loop performance in the $\mathcal{H}_2/\mathcal{H}_\infty$ sense. We also demonstrate that sparse actuation is achieved when the actuator magnitude-limits are minimized in the $l_1$ sense. This is the first paper that addresses this problem for LPV systems. The formulation is demonstrated in a vibration control problem for a flexible wing.

We compute the modular flow and conjugation of time interval algebras of conformal Generalized Free Fields (GFF) in $(0+1)$-dimensions in vacuum. For non-integer scaling dimensions, for general time-intervals, the modular conjugation and the modular flow of operators outside the algebra are non-geometric. This is because they involve a Generalized Hilbert Transform (GHT) that treats positive and negative frequency modes differently. However, the modular conjugation and flows viewed in the dual bulk AdS$_2$ are local, because the GHT geometrizes as the local antipodal symmetry transformation that pushes operators behind the Poincaré horizon. These algebras of conformal GFF satisfy a $\textit{Twisted Modular Inclusion}$ and a $\textit{Twisted Modular Intersection}$ property. We prove the converse statement that the existence of a (twisted) modular inclusion/intersection in any quantum system implies a representation of the (universal cover of) conformal group $PSL(2,\mathbb{R})$, respectively. We discuss the implications of our result for the emergence of Stringy AdS$_2$ geometries in large $N$ theories without a large gap. Our result applied to higher dimensional eternal AdS black holes explains the emergence of two copies of $PSL(2,\mathbb{R})$ on future and past Killing horizons.

Walks in Rotation Spaces Return Home When Doubled and Scaled

Subjects:

The dynamics of numerous physical systems, such as spins and qubits, can be described as a series of rotation operations, i.e., walks in the manifold of the rotation group. A basic question with practical applications is how likely and under what conditions such walks return to the origin (the identity rotation), which means that the physical system returns to its initial state. In three dimensions, we show that almost every walk in SO(3) or SU(2), even a very complicated one, will preferentially return to the origin simply by traversing the walk twice in a row and uniformly scaling all rotation angles. We explain why traversing the walk only once almost never suffices to return, and comment on the problem in higher dimensions.

Cluster Synchronization via Graph Laplacian Eigenvectors

Almost equitable partitions (AEPs) have been linked to cluster synchronization in oscillatory systems, highlighting the importance of structure in collective network dynamics. We provide a general spectral framework that formalizes this connection, showing how eigenvectors associated with AEPs span a subspace of the Laplacian spectrum that governs partition-induced synchronization behavior. This offers a principled reduction of network dynamics, allowing clustered states to be understood in terms of quotient graph projections. Our approach clarifies the conditions under which transient hierarchical clustering and multi-frequency synchronization emerge, and connects these dynamical phenomena directly to network symmetry and community structure. In doing so, we bridge a critical gap between static topology and dynamic behavior-namely, the lack of a spectral method for analyzing synchronization in networks that exhibit exact or approximate structural regularity. Perfect AEPs are rare in real-world networks since most have some degree of irregularity or noise. We define a relaxation of an AEP we call a quasi-equitable partition at level $\delta$ ($\delta-$QEP). $\delta-$QEPs can preserve many of the clustering-relevant properties of AEPs while tolerating structural imperfections and noise. This extension enables us to describe synchronization behavior in more realistic scenarios, where ideal symmetries are rarely present. Our findings have important implications for understanding synchronization patterns in real-world networks, from neural circuits to power grids.

This work focuses on the emergence of dark phases (dark energy-induced phases) in the radial wave function of scalar particles. We achieve this by presenting novel solutions to the Klein-Gordon equation in a spherically symmetric spacetime, which encompasses a black hole, a quintessential fluid, and a cloud of strings. We determine the exact solution for the spacetime metric, analyze the admissible ranges for its physical parameters, and discuss the formation of the event horizon. Subsequently, we detail the solution of the Klein-Gordon equation and explore three distinct cases of dark phases, corresponding to the quintessence state parameter $\alpha_{Q}$ taking the values $0$, $1/2$, and $1$. Notably, the case where $\alpha_{Q} = 1$ holds particular significance due to current observational constraints on dark energy.

This paper studies a Large Language Model's ability to exhibit intelligence equivalent to that of a human by analyzing temperature-induced phase transitions, abrupt changes in the macroscopic behavior of a system, in the Turing test. We utilize three approaches: statistical analysis and bias quantification of a human evaluation survey, information retrieval from real human-written versus AI-generated text data using cosine similarity as a comparison metric, and mathematical spin glass model and simulation. We collect text data in the case study of Flitzing, a tradition of emailing poem-like romantic invitations at Dartmouth College because of its richness in information. Across the three approaches, we obtain consistency in phase transition and clustering results, which also align with literature on the mathematics of transformers and metastability. Our work inspires utilizing spin glass theory for the mathematical foundations of artificial intelligence, especially under environmental stochasticity from human interactions, with justification from real data.

We investigate the collective dynamics of multivortex assemblies in a two dimensional (2D) toroidal fluid film of distinct curvature and topology. The incompressible and inviscid nature of the fluid allows a Hamiltonian description of the vortices, along with a self-force of geometric origin, arising from the standard Kirchhoff-Routh regularization procedure. The Hamiltonian dynamics is constructed in terms of $q$-digamma functions $\Psi_q(z)$, closely related to the Schottky-Klein prime function known to arise in multiply connected domains. We show the fundamental motion of the two-vortex system and identify five classes of geodesics on the torus for the special case of a vortex dipole, along with subtle distinctions from vortices in quantum superfluids. In multivortex assemblies, we observe that a randomly initialized cluster of vortices of the same sign and strength (chiral cluster) remains geometrically confined on the torus, while undergoing an overall drift along the toroidal direction, exhibiting collective dynamics. A cluster of fast and slow vortices also show the collective toroidal drift, with the fast ones predominantly occupying the core region and the slow ones expelled to the periphery of the revolving cluster. Vortex clusters of mixed sign but zero net circulation (achiral cluster) show unconfined dynamics and scatter all over the surface of the torus. A chiral cluster with an impurity in the form of a single vortex of opposite sign also show similar behavior as a pure chiral cluster, with occasional ``jets" of dipoles leaving and re-entering the revolving cluster. The work serves as a step towards analysis of vortex clusters in models that incorporate harmonic velocities in the Hodge decomposition.

Title:
Exact solution of asymmetric gelation between three walks on the square lattice

Subjects:

We find and analyse the exact solution of a model of three different
polymers with asymmetric contact interactions in two dimensions, modelling a
scenario where there are different types of polymers involved. In particular, we find
the generating function of three directed osculating walks in star
configurations on the square lattice with two interaction Boltzmann weights,
so that there is one type of contact interaction between the top pair of walks and a
different interaction between the bottom pair of walks. These osculating
stars are found to be the most amenable to exact solution using functional
equation techniques in comparison to the symmetric case where three friendly
walks in watermelon configurations were successfully solved with the same
techniques. We elucidate the phase diagram, which has four phases, and find
the order of all the phase transitions between them. We also calculate the
entropic exponents in each phase.

Theoretical analysis of biological and artificial neural networks e.g. modelling of synaptic or weight matrices necessitate consideration of the generic real-asymmetric matrix ensembles, those with varying order of matrix elements e.g. a sparse structure or a banded structure. We pursue the complexity parameter approach to analyze the spectral statistics of the multiparametric Gaussian ensembles of real asymmetric matrices and derive the ensemble averaged spectral densities for real as well as complex eigenvalues. Considerations of the matrix elements with arbitrary choice of mean and variances render us the freedom to model the desired sparsity in the ensemble. Our formulation provides a common mathematical formulation of the spectral statistics for a wide range of sparse real-asymmetric ensembles and also
reveals, thereby, a deep rooted universality among them.

Data-driven acceleration of scientific computing workflows has been a high-profile aim of machine learning (ML) for science, with numerical simulation of transient partial differential equations (PDEs) being one of the main applications. The focus thus far has been on methods that require classical simulations to train, which when combined with the data-hungriness and optimization challenges of neural networks has caused difficulties in demonstrating a convincing advantage against strong classical baselines. We consider an alternative paradigm in which the learner uses a classical solver's own data to accelerate it, enabling a one-shot speedup of the simulation. Concretely, since transient PDEs often require solving a sequence of related linear systems, the feedback from repeated calls to a linear solver such as preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) can be used by a bandit algorithm to online-learn an adaptive sequence of solver configurations (e.g. preconditioners). The method we develop, PCGBandit, is implemented directly on top of the popular open source software OpenFOAM, which we use to show its effectiveness on a set of fluid and magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) problems.

Title:
Similarity-based Outlier Detection for Noisy Object Re-Identification Using Beta Mixtures

Object re-identification (Re-ID) methods are highly sensitive to label noise, which typically leads to significant performance degradation. We address this challenge by reframing Re-ID as a supervised image similarity task and adopting a Siamese network architecture trained to capture discriminative pairwise relationships. Central to our approach is a novel statistical outlier detection (OD) framework, termed Beta-SOD (Beta mixture Similarity-based Outlier Detection), which models the distribution of cosine similarities between embedding pairs using a two-component Beta distribution mixture model. We establish a novel identifiability result for mixtures of two Beta distributions, ensuring that our learning task is well-posed. The proposed OD step complements the Re-ID architecture combining binary cross-entropy, contrastive, and cosine embedding losses that jointly optimize feature-level similarity this http URL demonstrate the effectiveness of Beta-SOD in de-noising and Re-ID tasks for person Re-ID, on CUHK03 and Market-1501 datasets, and vehicle Re-ID, on VeRi-776 dataset. Our method shows superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods across various noise levels (10-30\%), demonstrating both robustness and broad applicability in noisy Re-ID scenarios. The implementation of Beta-SOD is available at: this http URL
