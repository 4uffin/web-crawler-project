Title:
Reinforcement Learning-Based Market Making as a Stochastic Control on Non-Stationary Limit Order Book Dynamics
Rafael Zimmer, Oswaldo Luiz do Valle Costa
Comments:

Subjects:
Trading and Market Microstructure (q-fin.TR); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)
Reinforcement Learning has emerged as a promising framework for developing adaptive and data-driven strategies, enabling market makers to optimize decision-making policies based on interactions with the limit order book environment. This paper explores the integration of a reinforcement learning agent in a market-making context, where the underlying market dynamics have been explicitly modeled to capture observed stylized facts of real markets, including clustered order arrival times, non-stationary spreads and return drifts, stochastic order quantities and price volatility. These mechanisms aim to enhance stability of the resulting control agent, and serve to incorporate domain-specific knowledge into the agent policy learning process. Our contributions include a practical implementation of a market making agent based on the Proximal-Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, alongside a comparative evaluation of the agent's performance under varying market conditions via a simulator-based environment. As evidenced by our analysis of the financial return and risk metrics when compared to a closed-form optimal solution, our results suggest that the reinforcement learning agent can effectively be used under non-stationary market conditions, and that the proposed simulator-based environment can serve as a valuable tool for training and pre-training reinforcement learning agents in market-making scenarios.

Risk Management (q-fin.RM); Probability (math.PR); Statistics Theory (math.ST)
In this paper, we provide a new property of value at risk (VaR), which is a standard risk measure that is widely used in quantitative financial risk management. We show that the subadditivity of VaR for given loss random variables holds for any confidence level if and only if those are comonotonic. This result also gives a new equivalent condition for the comonotonicity of random vectors.

In volatile financial markets, balancing risk and return remains a significant challenge. Traditional approaches often focus solely on equity allocation, overlooking the strategic advantages of options trading for dynamic risk hedging. This work presents DeltaHedge, a multi-agent framework that integrates options trading with AI-driven portfolio management. By combining advanced reinforcement learning techniques with an ensembled options-based hedging strategy, DeltaHedge enhances risk-adjusted returns and stabilizes portfolio performance across varying market conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that DeltaHedge outperforms traditional strategies and standalone models, underscoring its potential to transform practical portfolio management in complex financial environments. Building on these findings, this paper contributes to the fields of quantitative finance and AI-driven portfolio optimization by introducing a novel multi-agent system for integrating options trading strategies, addressing a gap in the existing literature.

Myopic optimization (MO) outperforms reinforcement learning (RL) in portfolio management: RL yields lower or negative returns, higher variance, larger costs, heavier CVaR, lower profitability, and greater model risk. We model execution/liquidation frictions with mark-to-market accounting. Using Malliavin calculus (Clark-Ocone/BEL), we derive policy gradients and risk shadow price, unifying HJB and KKT. This gives dual gap and convergence results: geometric MO vs. RL floors. We quantify phantom profit in RL via Malliavin policy-gradient contamination analysis and define a control-affects-dynamics (CAD) premium of RL indicating plausibly positive.

Title:
Income Disaster, Role of Income Support, and Optimal Retirement
Tae Ung Gang, Seyoung Park, Yong Hyun Shin
Comments:

Subjects:
Portfolio Management (q-fin.PM)
This paper investigates the interactions among consumption/savings, investment, and retirement choices with income disaster. We consider low-income people who are exposed to income disaster so that they retire involuntarily when income disaster occurs. The government provides extra income support to low-income retirees who suffer from significant income gaps. We demonstrate that the decision to enter retirement in the event of income disaster depends crucially on the level of income support. In particular, we quantitatively identify a certain income support level below which the optimal decision is to delay retirement. This implies that availability of the government's extra income support can be particularly important for the low-income people to achieve optimal retirement with income disaster.

Title:
Optimal Annuitization with stochastic mortality: Piecewise Deterministic Mortality Force
Matteo Buttarazzi, Tiziano De Angelis, Gabriele Stabile
Comments:

Subjects:
Mathematical Finance (q-fin.MF); Optimization and Control (math.OC)
This paper addresses the problem of determining the optimal time for an individual to convert retirement savings into a lifetime annuity. The individual invests their wealth into a dividend-paying fund that follows the dynamics of a geometric Brownian motion, exposing them to market risk. At the same time, they face an uncertain lifespan influenced by a stochastic mortality force. The latter is modelled as a piecewise deterministic Markov process (PDMP), which captures sudden and unpredictable changes in the individual's mortality force. The individual aims to maximise expected lifetime linear utility from consumption and bequest, balancing market risk and longevity risk under an irreversible, all-or-nothing annuitization decision. The problem is formulated as a three-dimensional optimal stopping problem and, by exploiting the PDMP structure, it is reduced to a sequence of nested one-dimensional problems. We solve the optimal stopping problem and find a rich structure for the optimal annuitization rule, which cover all parameter specifications. Our theoretical analysis is complemented by a numerical example illustrating the impact of a single health shock on annuitization timing, along with a sensitivity analysis of key model parameters.

A hidden benefit of incomplete round-robin tournaments: Encouraging offensive play
László Csató
Subjects:
General Economics (econ.GN); Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph); Applications (stat.AP)
This paper aims to explore the impact of tournament design on the incentives of the contestants. We develop a simulation framework to quantify the potential gain and loss from attacking based on changes in the probability of reaching the critical ranking thresholds. The model is applied to investigate the 2024/25 UEFA Champions League reform. The novel incomplete round-robin league phase is found to create more powerful incentives for offensive play than the previous group stage, with an average increase of 119\% (58\%) regarding the first (second) prize. Our study provides the first demonstration that the tournament format itself can strongly influence team behaviour in sports.

Title:
Context-Aware Language Models for Forecasting Market Impact from Sequences of Financial News

Financial news plays a critical role in the information diffusion process in financial markets and is a known driver of stock prices. However, the information in each news article is not necessarily self-contained, often requiring a broader understanding of the historical news coverage for accurate interpretation. Further, identifying and incorporating the most relevant contextual information presents significant challenges. In this work, we explore the value of historical context in the ability of large language models to understand the market impact of financial news. We find that historical context provides a consistent and significant improvement in performance across methods and time horizons. To this end, we propose an efficient and effective contextualization method that uses a large LM to process the main article, while a small LM encodes the historical context into concise summary embeddings that are then aligned with the large model's representation space. We explore the behavior of the model through multiple qualitative and quantitative interpretability tests and reveal insights into the value of contextualization. Finally, we demonstrate that the value of historical context in model predictions has real-world applications, translating to substantial improvements in simulated investment performance.

Title:
Strassen's theorem for biased convex order
Beatrice Acciaio, Mathias Beiglböck, Evgeny Kolosov, Gudmund Pammer
Comments:

Subjects:
Probability (math.PR); Mathematical Finance (q-fin.MF)
Strassen's theorem asserts that for given marginal probabilities $\mu,\nu$ there exists a martingale starting in $\mu$ and terminating in $\nu$ if and only if $\mu,\nu$ are in convex order. From a financial perspective, it guarantees the existence of market-consistent martingale pricing measures for arbitrage-free prices of European call options and thus plays a fundamental role in robust finance. Arbitrage-free prices of American options demand a stronger version of martingales which are 'biased' in a specific sense. In this paper, we derive an extension of Strassen's theorem that links them to an appropriate strengthening of the convex order. Moreover, we provide a characterization of this order through integrals with respect to compensated Poisson processes.

Title:
Optimal Liquidation with Signals: the General Propagator Case
Eduardo Abi Jaber, Eyal Neuman
Comments:
54 pages, 5 figures
Subjects:
Trading and Market Microstructure (q-fin.TR); Probability (math.PR)
We consider a class of optimal liquidation problems where the agent's transactions create transient price impact driven by a Volterra-type propagator along with temporary price impact. We formulate these problems as maximization of a revenue-risk functionals, where the agent also exploits available information on a progressively measurable price predicting signal. By using an infinite dimensional stochastic control approach, we characterize the value function in terms of a solution to a free-boundary $L^2$-valued backward stochastic differential equation and an operator-valued Riccati equation. We then derive analytic solutions to these equations which yields an explicit expression for the optimal trading strategy. We show that our formulas can be implemented in a straightforward and efficient way for a large class of price impact kernels with possible singularities such as the power-law kernel.

Title:
Global Stock Market Volatility Forecasting Incorporating Dynamic Graphs and All Trading Days
Zhengyang Chi, Junbin Gao, Chao Wang
Subjects:
General Finance (q-fin.GN); General Economics (econ.GN)
This paper introduces a global stock market volatility forecasting model that enhances forecasting accuracy and practical utility in real-world financial decision-making by integrating dynamic graph structures and encompassing all active trading days of different stock markets. The model employs a spatial-temporal graph neural network architecture to capture the volatility spillover effect, where shocks in one market spread to others through the interconnective global economy. By calculating the volatility spillover index to depict the volatility network as graphs, the model effectively mirrors the volatility dynamics for the chosen stock market indices. In the empirical analysis covering 8 global market indices, the realized volatility forecasting performance of the proposed model surpasses the baseline models in all forecasting scenarios.

Robust forward investment and consumption under drift and volatility uncertainties: A randomization approach
Wing Fung Chong, Gechun Liang
Comments:
37 pages
Subjects:
Portfolio Management (q-fin.PM); Mathematical Finance (q-fin.MF)
This paper studies robust forward investment and consumption preferences and optimal strategies for a risk-averse and ambiguity-averse agent in an incomplete financial market with drift and volatility uncertainties. We focus on non-zero volatility and constant relative risk aversion forward preferences. Given the non-convexity of the Hamiltonian with respect to uncertain volatilities, we first construct robust randomized forward preferences through endogenous randomization in an auxiliary market. {Therein, w}e derive the corresponding optimal and robust investment and consumption strategies. Furthermore, we show that such forward preferences and strategies, developed in the auxiliary market, remain optimal and robust in the physical market, offering a comprehensive {analysis} for forward investment and consumption under model uncertainty.

Title:
Mean-Reverting SABR Models: Closed-form Surfaces and Calibration for Equities

Comments:
KEYWORDS: Volatility Smiles, Volatility Surfaces, Stochastic Volatility, Mean Reversion, SABR, Heston, Implied Volatilities, Closed-Form Approximation, Equity / Stock / Index Options. GITHUB: The Python code accompanying this paper is available in the following repository: this https URL

Pricing of Securities (q-fin.PR)
In this paper, we consider three stochastic-volatility models, each characterized by distinct dynamics of instantaneous volatility: (1) a CIR process for squared volatility (i.e., the classical Heston model); (2) a mean-reverting lognormal process for volatility; and (3) a CIR process for volatility. Previous research has provided semi-analytical approximations for these models in the form of simple (non-mean-reverting) SABR models, each suitably parameterized for a given expiry.
First, using a computer algebra system, we derive closed-form expressions for these semi-analytical approximations, under the assumption that all parameters remain constant (but without the constraint of constant expected volatility). Although the resulting formulas are considerably lengthier than those in simpler SABR models, they remain tractable and are easily implementable even in Excel.
Second, employing these closed-form expressions, we calibrate the three models to empirical volatility surfaces observed in EuroStoxx index options. The calibration is well-behaved and achieves excellent fits for the observed equity-volatility surfaces, with only five parameters per surface. Consequently, the approximate models offer a simpler, faster, and (numerically) more reliable alternative to the classical Heston model, or to more advanced models, which lack closed-form solutions and can be numerically challenging, particularly in less sophisticated implementation environments.
Third, we examine the stability and correlations of our parameter estimates. In this analysis, we identify certain issues with the models - one of which appears to stem from the sub-lognormal behavior of the actual equity-volatility process. Notably, the CIR-volatility model (3), as opposed to the CIR-variance Heston model (1), seems to best capture this behavior, and also results in more stable parameters.

Pricing of Securities (q-fin.PR)
This work examines a stochastic volatility model with double-exponential jumps in the context of option pricing. The model has been considered in previous research articles, but no thorough analysis has been conducted to study its quality of calibration and pricing capabilities thus far. We provide evidence that this model outperforms challenger models possessing similar features (stochastic volatility and jumps), especially in the fit of the short term implied volatility smile, and that it is particularly tractable for the pricing of exotic options from different generations. The article utilizes Fourier pricing techniques (the PROJ method and its refinements) for different types of claims and several generations of exotics (Asian options, cliquets, barrier options, and options on realized variance), and all source codes are made publicly available to facilitate adoption and future research. The results indicate that this model is highly promising, thanks to the asymmetry of the jumps distribution allowing it to capture richer dynamics than a normal jump size distribution. The parameters all have meaningful econometrics interpretations that are important for adoption by risk-managers.

Through the Looking Glass: Bitcoin Treasury Companies
B K Meister
Comments:

Subjects:
Portfolio Management (q-fin.PM)
Bitcoin treasury companies have taken stock markets by storm amassing billions of dollars worth of tokens in hundreds of entities. The paper discusses, how leverage - whether created through corporate debt or investors using stock as loan collateral - fuels this trend. The extension of the binary-choice Kelly criterion to incorporate uncertainty in the form of the Kullback-Leibler divergence or more generally Bregman divergence is also briefly discussed.

Title:
Returns and Order Flow Imbalances: Intraday Dynamics and Macroeconomic News Effects
Makoto Takahashi
Subjects:
Trading and Market Microstructure (q-fin.TR); Econometrics (econ.EM)
We study the interaction between returns and order flow imbalances in the S&P 500 E-mini futures market using a structural VAR model identified through heteroskedasticity. The model is estimated at one-second frequency for each 15-minute interval, capturing both intraday variation and endogeneity due to time aggregation. We find that macroeconomic news announcements sharply reshape price-flow dynamics: price impact rises, flow impact declines, return volatility spikes, and flow volatility falls. Pooling across days, both price and flow impacts are significant at the one-second horizon, with estimates broadly consistent with stylized limit-order-book predictions. Impulse responses indicate that shocks dissipate almost entirely within a second. Structural parameters and volatilities also exhibit pronounced intraday variation tied to liquidity, trading intensity, and spreads. These results provide new evidence on high-frequency price formation and liquidity, highlighting the role of public information and order submission in shaping market quality.

Title:
Geopolitical Barriers to Globalization
Tianyu Fan, Mai Wo, Wei Xiang
Subjects:
General Economics (econ.GN)
This paper estimates and quantifies how geopolitical alignment shapes global trade across three distinct eras: the Cold War, hyper-globalization, and contemporary fragmentation. We construct a novel measure of bilateral alignment using large language models to compile and analyze 833,485 political events spanning 193 countries from 1950 to 2024. Our analysis reveals that trade flows systematically track geopolitical alignment in both bilateral relationships and aggregate patterns. Using local projections within a gravity framework, we estimate that a one-standard-deviation improvement in geopolitical alignment increases bilateral trade by 20 percent over ten years. Integrating these elasticities into a quantitative general equilibrium model, we find that deteriorating geopolitical relations have reduced global trade by 7 percentage points between 1995 and 2020. Our findings provide empirical benchmarks for evaluating the costs of geopolitical fragmentation in an era of renewed great power competition.

Assignment at the Frontier: Identifying the Frontier Structural Function and Bounding Mean Deviations
Dan Ben-Moshe, David Genesove
Subjects:
Econometrics (econ.EM); General Economics (econ.GN)
This paper analyzes a model in which an outcome equals a frontier function of inputs minus a nonnegative unobserved deviation. We allow the distribution of the deviation to depend on inputs. If zero lies in the support of the deviation given inputs -- an assumption we term assignment at the frontier -- then the frontier is identified by the supremum of the outcome at those inputs, obviating the need for instrumental variables. We then estimate the frontier, allowing for random error whose distribution may also depend on inputs. Finally, we derive a lower bound on the mean deviation, using only variance and skewness, that is robust to a scarcity of data near the frontier. We apply our methods to estimate a firm-level frontier production function and mean inefficiency.
