Title:
Linear fractional relative risk aversion
Kristian Behrens, Yasusada Murata
Comments:
63 pages, 0 figures
Subjects:
General Economics (econ.GN)
We characterize the family of utility functions satisfying linear fractional relative risk aversion (LFRRA) in terms of the Gauss hypergeometric functions. We apply this family, which nests various utility functions used in different strands of literature, to monopolistic competition and obtain a closed-form solution for the profit-maximizing price by generalizing the Lambert W function. We let firm-level data decide whether the RRA in each sector or in the aggregate economy is increasing, decreasing, or constant, which in turn determines whether markups are decreasing, increasing, or constant with respect to marginal costs.

Title:
Robo-Advisors Beyond Automation: Principles and Roadmap for AI-Driven Financial Planning
Runhuan Feng, Hong Li, Ming Liu
Comments:
37 pages, 2 figures
Subjects:
General Economics (econ.GN)
Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming financial planning by expanding access, lowering costs, and enabling dynamic, data-driven advice. Yet without clear safeguards, digital platforms risk reproducing longstanding market inefficiencies such as information asymmetry, misaligned incentives, and systemic fragility. This paper develops a framework for responsible AI in financial planning, anchored in five principles: fiduciary duty, adaptive personalization, technical robustness, ethical and fairness constraints, and auditability. We illustrate these risks and opportunities through case studies, and extend the framework into a five-level roadmap of AI financial intermediaries. By linking technological design to economic theory, we show how AI can either amplify vulnerabilities or create more resilient, trustworthy forms of financial intermediation.

Title:
Price Formation in a Highly-Renewable, Sector-Coupled Energy System
Julian Geis, Fabian Neumann, Michael Lindner, Philipp Härtel, Tom Brown
Subjects:
General Economics (econ.GN)
As variable renewable energy increases and more demand is electrified, we expect price formation in wholesale electricity markets to transition from being dominated by fossil fuel generators to being dominated by the opportunity costs of storage and demand management. In order to analyse this transition, we introduce a new method to investigate price formation based on a mapping from the dual variables of the energy system optimisation problem to the bids and asks of electricity suppliers and consumers. This allows us to build the full supply and demand curves in each hour. We use this method to analyse price formation in a sector-coupled, climate-neutral energy system model for Germany, PyPSA-DE, with high temporal resolution and myopic foresight in 5-year steps from 2020 until full decarbonisation in 2045. We find a clear transition from distinct price levels, corresponding to fossil fuels, to a smoother price curve set by variable renewable energy sources, batteries and electrolysis. Despite higher price volatility, the fully decarbonised system clears with non-zero prices in 75% of all hours. Our results suggest that flexibility and cross-sectoral demand bidding play a vital role in stabilising electricity prices in a climate-neutral future. These findings are highly relevant for guiding investment decisions and informing policy, particularly in support of dynamic pricing, the expansion of energy storage across multiple timescales, and the coordinated development of renewable and flexibility technologies.

Title:
Competition and Incentives in a Shared Order Book
René Aïd, Philippe Bergault, Mathieu Rosenbaum
Subjects:
Trading and Market Microstructure (q-fin.TR)
Recent regulation on intraday electricity markets has led to the development of shared order books with the intention to foster competition and increase market liquidity. In this paper, we address the question of the efficiency of such regulations by analysing the situation of two exchanges sharing a single limit order book, i.e. a quote by a market maker can be hit by a trade arriving on the other exchange. We develop a Principal-Agent model where each exchange acts as the Principal of her own market maker acting as her Agent. Exchanges and market makers have all CARA utility functions with potentially different risk-aversion parameters. In terms of mathematical result, we show existence and uniqueness of the resulting Nash equilibrium between exchanges, give the optimal incentive contracts and provide numerical solution to the PDE satisfied by the certainty equivalent of the exchanges. From an economic standpoint, our model demonstrates that incentive provision constitutes a public good. More precisely, it highlights the presence of a competitiveness spillover effect: when one exchange optimally incentivizes its market maker, the competing exchange also reaps indirect benefits. This interdependence gives rise to a free-rider problem. Given that providing incentives entails a cost, the strategic interaction between exchanges may lead to an equilibrium in which neither platform offers incentives -- ultimately resulting in diminished overall competition.

Title:
The anatomy of Green AI technologies: structure, evolution, and impact
Lorenzo Emer, Andrea Mina, Andrea Vandin
Subjects:
General Economics (econ.GN)
Artificial intelligence (AI) is a key enabler of innovation against climate change. In this study, we investigate the intersection of AI and climate adaptation and mitigation technologies through patent analyses of a novel dataset of approximately 63 000 Green AI patents. We analyze patenting trends, corporate ownership of the technology, the geographical distributions of patents, their impact on follow-on inventions and their market value. We use topic modeling (BERTopic) to identify 16 major technological domains, track their evolution over time, and identify their relative impact. We uncover a clear shift from legacy domains such as combustion engines technology to emerging areas like data processing, microgrids, and agricultural water management. We find evidence of growing concentration in corporate patenting against a rapidly increasing number of patenting firms. Looking at the technological and economic impact of patents, while some Green AI domains combine technological impact and market value, others reflect weaker private incentives for innovation, despite their relevance for climate adaptation and mitigation strategies. This is where policy intervention might be required to foster the generation and use of new Green AI applications.

General Economics (econ.GN)
This paper investigates the economic feasibility of replacing human labor with robotics and automation in Qatar's manufacturing and service sectors. By analyzing labor costs, productivity gains, and implementation expenses, the study assesses the potential financial impact and return on investment of robotic integration. Results indicate the sectors where automation is economically viable and identify challenges related to workforce adaptation, policy, and infrastructure. These insights provide guidance for policymakers and industry stakeholders considering automation strategies in Qatar.

Title:
The temporary impact of permanent hiring incentives: Evidence from Italy
Michele Cantarella, Maria Cristina Maurizio, Francesco Serti
Comments:
44 pages, 11 figures
Subjects:
General Economics (econ.GN)
This paper evaluates the short and medium-term effectiveness of hiring incentives aimed at promoting the permanent conversion of temporary contracts through social contribution exemptions. Using rich administrative data from Tuscany, providing detailed employment histories, we use difference in differences and regression discontinuity designs to exploit a unique change in eligibility criteria in 2018. We find that the incentives immediately increased the probability of conversion, with no evidence of substitution against non-eligible cohorts. However, these positive effects were short-lived and appear to reflect anticipated conversions, as we find null longer-term effects on permanent hirings.

Title:
The Interplay between Utility and Risk in Portfolio Selection
Leonardo Baggiani, Martin Herdegen, Nazem Khan
Subjects:
Mathematical Finance (q-fin.MF); Portfolio Management (q-fin.PM); Risk Management (q-fin.RM)
We revisit the problem of portfolio selection, where an investor maximizes utility subject to a risk constraint. Our framework is very general and accommodates a wide range of utility and risk functionals, including non-concave utilities such as S-shaped utilities from prospect theory and non-convex risk measures such as Value at Risk. Our main contribution is a novel and complete characterization of well-posedness for utility-risk portfolio selection in one period that takes the interplay between the utility and the risk objectives fully into account. We show that under mild regularity conditions the minimal necessary and sufficient condition for well-posedness is given by a very simple either-or criterion: either the utility functional or the risk functional need to satisfy the axiom of sensitivity to large losses. This allows to easily describe well-posedness or ill-posedness for many utility-risk pairs, which we illustrate by a large number of examples. In the special case of expected utility maximization without a risk constraint (but including non-concave utilities), we show that well-posedness is fully characterised by the asymptotic loss-gain ratio, a simple and interpretable quantity that describes the investor's asymptotic relative weighting of large losses versus large gains.

Title:
Ultrafast Extreme Events: Empirical Analysis of Mechanisms and Recovery in a Historical Perspective
Luca Henrichs, Anton J. Heckens, Thomas Guhr
Subjects:
Trading and Market Microstructure (q-fin.TR)
To understand the emergence of Ultrafast Extreme Events (UEEs), the influence of algorithmic trading or high-frequency traders is of major interest as they make it extremely difficult to intervene and to stabilize financial markets. In an empirical analysis, we compare various characteristics of UEEs over different years for the US stock market to assess the possible non-stationarity of the effects. We show that liquidity plays a dominant role in the emergence of UEEs and find a general pattern in their dynamics. We also empirically investigate the after-effects in view of the recovery rate. We find common patterns for different years. We explain changes in the recovery rate by varying market sentiments for the different years.

Title:
An Axiomatic Risk-Reward Framework for Sustainable Investing
Gabriele Torri, Rosella Giacometti, Darinka Dentcheva, Svetlozar T. Rachev, W. Brent Lindquist
Subjects:
Mathematical Finance (q-fin.MF)
Continued interest in sustainable investing calls for an axiomatic approach to measures of risk and reward that focus not only on financial returns, but also on measures of environmental and social sustainability, i.e. environmental, social, and governance (ESG) scores. We propose definitions for ESG-coherent risk measures and ESG reward-risk ratios based on functions of bivariate random variables that are applied to financial returns and real-time ESG scores, extending the traditional univariate measures to the ESG case. We provide examples and present an empirical analysis in which the ESG-coherent risk measures and ESG reward-risk ratios are used to rank stocks.

Title:
Solution to the Equity Premium Puzzle with Time Varying Variables
Atilla Aras
Comments:
Some corrections are made; 20 pages; 4 tables and appendix
Subjects:
General Finance (q-fin.GN)
The article's aim is to provide a solution to the Equity Premium Puzzle with a derived model. The derived model which depends on Consumption Capital Asset Pricing Model gives a solution to the puzzle with the values of coefficient of relative risk aversion around 4.40 by assuming the subjective time discount factors as 0.97, 0.98 and 0.99. These values are found compatible with empirical literature. Moreover, the risk-free asset and equity investors are determined as insufficient risk-loving investors in 1977, which can be considered a type of risk-averse behavior. The risk attitude determination also confirms the validity of the model. Hence, it can be stated that calculated values and risk behavior determination demonstrate the correctness of the derived model because test results are robust.

Title:
The Precautionary Principle and the Innovation Principle: Incompatible Guides for AI Innovation Governance?
Kim Kaivanto
Comments:
47 pages
Subjects:
Computers and Society (cs.CY); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); General Economics (econ.GN)
In policy debates concerning the governance and regulation of Artificial Intelligence (AI), both the Precautionary Principle (PP) and the Innovation Principle (IP) are advocated by their respective interest groups. Do these principles offer wholly incompatible and contradictory guidance? Does one necessarily negate the other? I argue here that provided attention is restricted to weak-form PP and IP, the answer to both of these questions is "No." The essence of these weak formulations is the requirement to fully account for type-I error costs arising from erroneously preventing the innovation's diffusion through society (i.e. mistaken regulatory red-lighting) as well as the type-II error costs arising from erroneously allowing the innovation to diffuse through society (i.e. mistaken regulatory green-lighting). Within the Signal Detection Theory (SDT) model developed here, weak-PP red-light (weak-IP green-light) determinations are optimal for sufficiently small (large) ratios of expected type-I to type-II error costs. For intermediate expected cost ratios, an amber-light 'wait-and-monitor' policy is optimal. Regulatory sandbox instruments allow AI testing and experimentation to take place within a structured environment of limited duration and societal scale, whereby the expected cost ratio falls within the 'wait-and-monitor' range. Through sandboxing regulators and innovating firms learn more about the expected cost ratio, and what respective adaptations -- of regulation, of technical solution, of business model, or combination thereof, if any -- are needed to keep the ratio out of the weak-PP red-light zone. Nevertheless AI foundation models are ill-suited for regulatory sandboxing as their general-purpose nature precludes credible identification of misclassification costs.

Title:
Web3 x AI Agents: Landscape, Integrations, and Foundational Challenges
Yiming Shen, Jiashuo Zhang, Zhenzhe Shao, Wenxuan Luo, Yanlin Wang, Ting Chen, Zibin Zheng, Jiachi Chen
Subjects:
Computers and Society (cs.CY); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); General Economics (econ.GN)
The convergence of Web3 technologies and AI agents represents a rapidly evolving frontier poised to reshape decentralized ecosystems. This paper presents the first and most comprehensive analysis of the intersection between Web3 and AI agents, examining five critical dimensions: landscape, economics, governance, security, and trust mechanisms. Through an analysis of 133 existing projects, we first develop a taxonomy and systematically map the current market landscape (RQ1), identifying distinct patterns in project distribution and capitalization. Building upon these findings, we further investigate four key integrations: (1) the role of AI agents in participating in and optimizing decentralized finance (RQ2); (2) their contribution to enhancing Web3 governance mechanisms (RQ3); (3) their capacity to strengthen Web3 security via intelligent vulnerability detection and automated smart contract auditing (RQ4); and (4) the establishment of robust reliability frameworks for AI agent operations leveraging Web3's inherent trust infrastructure (RQ5). By synthesizing these dimensions, we identify key integration patterns, highlight foundational challenges related to scalability, security, and ethics, and outline critical considerations for future research toward building robust, intelligent, and trustworthy decentralized systems with effective AI agent interactions.
