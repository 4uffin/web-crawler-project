Title:
SU(3) rigid triaxiality in $^{154}$Sm
Chunxiao Zhou, Xue Shang, Tao Wang
Subjects:
Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)
The $^{154}$Sm nucleus, which has long been regarded as a typical quantum system exhibiting axial symmetry, has been recently suggested to exhibit a small degree of triaxiality by Otsuka \textit{et al.}. This small triaxiality was recently observed using the $\gamma$ decay of the $^{154}$Sm isovector giant dipole resonance. Thus further studying this small triaxiality is very necessary for understanding the nature of the collectivity in nuclei. In this paper, the rigid triaxiality in $^{154}$Sm is investigated using the newly proposed SU3-IBM theory. If the irreducible representation (irrep) of the ground state is (18,2) in the SU(3) symmetry limit, the new model can effectively reproduce the experimental data of $^{154}$Sm, showing good agreements with realistic energy spectra, B(E2) values, and quadrupole moments. This result further confirms the vality of the SU3-IBM for the description of the rigid triaxiality in realistic nuclei, and reveals the SU(3) dominance of the collectivity motions in nuclei.

Title:
Nuclear chiral density wave in neutron stars?

Anisotropic phases potentially play a role in the internal composition of neutron stars, the main laboratory for the phase structure of QCD at high baryon densities. We review the study of such a phase, the chiral density wave, within a phenomenological nucleon-meson model, including nucleonic vacuum fluctuations within a renormalization scheme recently developed. Neutron stars in this model and within our approximations either do not contain a chiral density wave core or they are too light to agree with observations.

Title:
Effective Mass in Quantum Hadrodynamics-I and its Impact on the Equation of State of Neutron Matter
Ghitha Nadhira Azka Rahiemy, Eko Tri Sulistyani, Pekik Nurwantoro
Subjects:
Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE)
The effective nucleon mass (M^*) plays a central role in Quantum Hadrodynamics-I (QHD-I), linking scalar meson interactions at the microscopic level to the macroscopic properties of dense nuclear matter. In this work, we re-derive the scalar density integral in detail and validate it numerically using Gaussian quadrature. The numerical and analytic results are found to be in excellent agreement, confirming the robustness of both approaches. We then investigate the sensitivity of M^* to different parameter sets, highlighting its strong influence on nuclear saturation, compressibility, and the resulting equation of state (EoS). The analysis shows that variations in meson-nucleon couplings propagate directly into differences in pressure and energy density, affecting the stiffness of the EoS. While QHD-I produces characteristically stiff EoS, the effective mass evaluation provides a transparent framework for connecting microscopic meson dynamics to macroscopic neutron star properties. These findings underline the relevance of M^* as a microscopic-macroscopic bridge and demonstrate the utility of numerical methods for extending relativistic mean-field models in nuclear astrophysics.

Title:

The $^{93}$Nb($t$,$^{3}$He) reaction at 115 MeV/u was studied to demonstrate that nuclear level densities and $\gamma$-ray strength functions can be extracted from charge-exchange reactions at intermediate energies using the Oslo technique. The matrix of excitation energy in $^{93}$Zr, reconstructed from the ($t$,$^{3}$He) reaction, versus the energy of $\gamma$ rays emitted by the excited $^{93}$Zr nuclei, was obtained in an experiment with the S800 Spectrograph operated in coincidence with the GRETINA $\gamma$-ray detector. The extracted level density and $\gamma$-ray strength function obtained by applying the Oslo method to this matrix were used to estimate the $^{92}$Zr($n$,$\gamma$)$^{93}$Zr cross section by combining the new results with other experimental data and theoretical calculations for $E$1 and $M$1 strength functions at higher energies. Good agreement with direct measurements of the $^{92}$Zr($n$,$\gamma$)$^{93}$Zr cross section was found. The contribution from the upbend in the extracted $\gamma$-ray strength function was important to achieve the consistency as the neutron-capture cross section without this contribution is significantly below the direct measurements otherwise. Since charge-exchange reactions at intermediate energies have long been used for extracting Gamow-Teller strengths, the successful demonstration of the charge-exchange Oslo method enables experiments in which ($n$,$\gamma$) cross sections and Gamow-Teller strengths can be measured simultaneously, which is of benefit for astrophysical studies.

Title:
Gluon splitting rates in an anisotropic plasma in the AMY formalism
Florian Lindenbauer

12 pages, 3 figures
Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)
We introduce a novel numerical method to obtain the gluon splitting rates in an anisotropic QCD plasma in the AMY formalism, suitable for an anisotropic collision kernel. The method extends previous works by decomposing the additional angular information into Fourier modes, resulting in a significantly larger system of differential equations to solve numerically. It is then tested by calculating the rates for a simple anisotropic model for the collision kernel, which is compared to a thermal system. Remarkably, the obtained rates can be well-approximated by the rates calculated from an angular-averaged collision kernel, while still deviating significantly from equilibrium. An isotropic model for the collision kernel that is commonly used in QCD kinetic theory simulations, and which relies on the infrared temperature $T_*$ and an effective Debye mass, leads to rates that significantly deviate from the nonequilibrium rate, particularly at smaller parton energies.

Title:
On pseudo-gauge ambiguity in the distributions of energy density, pressure, and shear force inside the nucleon
Kenji Fukushima, Tomoya Uji

10 pages, 8 figures
Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)
We study the spatial distributions of pressure, energy density, and shear forces inside the nucleon within the two-flavor Skyrme model including vector mesons. This framework has the advantage that nucleon configurations can be stabilized without the Skyrme term. In contrast to the model without vector mesons, however, we realize that the energy-momentum tensor (EMT) becomes pseudo-gauge dependent. We explicitly demonstrate that all these distributions differ between the canonical and Belinfante forms of the EMTs. We identify the pseudo-gauge ambiguity as originating from nonvanishing surface terms associated with spin currents generated by the vector-meson field strength tensors. Furthermore, we show that the pressure and shear-force distributions in the canonical EMT develop singularities at the nucleon center, whereas the corresponding Belinfante distributions remain finite. Finally, we discuss the implications of pseudo-gauge dependence for extracting the confining force and for constructing the equation of state inside the nucleon.

Title:
Inner crust of neutron stars: Polymorphism and superconductivity in the liquid drop model

Within the liquid drop model built up with the nuclear interaction parametrization Sk$\chi$450, which is based on the chiral effective field theory, we calculate numerically the internal energy density for each of nuclear pasta phases and for the uniform nuclear matter. We provide quantitative arguments in favor of coexistence of various nuclear matter phases at a significant range of total pressure within the inner crust of neutron stars, a concept known as crystal polymorphism. Specifically, we find that differences of the internal energy per baryon for various phases are typically less than the thermal energy per a freedom degree at temperature about $10^8$--$10^9$ K, which sets the energetic scale for thermal fluctuations of state of Fermi liquid from the ground state. The nuclear energy contributions are described using the same parametrization Sk$\chi$450 for the bulk, plain surface and curvature terms. We find that the introduction of the curvature correction changes the ground state in a relevant way. This may be understood as a consequence of the corresponding change in size of the nucleus, which significantly modifies the phase transition densities. Using the calculated structural parameters from liquid drop model, we explore the physical consequences of the expected Cooper pairing of protons in lasagna phase. In this case, we find a crossover between the discreet layered and the three-dimensional anisotropic regimes of superconductivity. Additionally, we study the magnetic stress in lasagna accounting for a rotational lag between superfluid neutrons and the crystal lattice, which is believed to develop naturally in pulsars and magnetars. Our results offer a preliminary insight into rich magnetic properties of the inner crust of neutron stars.

Perturbation theory for a systematic account of the bound-state motion

We derive a perturbation theory (PT) for the Lorentz boost operator in the space of two-nucleon wave functions. The latter is expressed in terms of the nucleon-nucleon ($NN$) potentials, developed so far in great detail for their use in the $NN$ scattering studies. The PT is designed to take into account the boost relativistic corrections in a systematic way and, as such, it is the only missing part in the corresponding approaches developed up to now in the low-energy effective field theories.

Title:
Bulk Viscosity of Two-Flavor Color Superconducting Quark Matter in Neutron Star Mergers

This work investigates the bulk viscosity of warm, dense, neutrino-transparent, color-superconducting quark matter, where damping of density oscillations in the kHz frequency range arises from weak-interaction-driven direct Urca processes involving quarks. We study the two-flavor red-green paired color-superconducting (2SC) phase, while allowing for the presence of unpaired strange quarks and blue color light quarks of all flavors. Our calculations are based on the SU(3) Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model, extended to include both vector interactions and the `t Hooft determinant term. The primary focus is on how variations in the NJL Lagrangian parameters -- specifically, the diquark and vector coupling strengths -- affect both the static properties of quark matter, such as its equation of state and composition, and its dynamical behavior, including bulk viscosity and associated damping timescales. We find that the bulk viscosity and corresponding damping timescale can change by more than an order of magnitude upon varying the vector coupling by a factor of two at high densities and by a lesser degree at lower densities. This sensitivity primarily arises from the susceptibility of 2SC matter, with a smaller contribution from modifications to the weak interaction rates. In comparison, changes in the diquark coupling have a more limited impact. The damping of density oscillations in 2SC matter is similar quantitatively to nucleonic matter and can be a leading mechanism of dissipation in merging hybrid stars containing color superconducting cores.

Title:
Weighted Levenberg-Marquardt methods for fitting multichannel nuclear cross section data

Subjects:

We present an extension of the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm for fitting multichannel nuclear cross section data. Our approach offers a practical and robust alternative to conventional trust-region methods for analyzing experimental data. The CoH$_3$ code, based on the Hauser-Feshbach statistical model, involves a large number of interdependent parameters, making optimization challenging due to the presence of "sloppy" directions in parameter space. To address the uneven distribution of experimental data across reaction channels, we construct a weighted Fisher Information Metric by integrating prior distributions over dataset weights. This framework enables a more balanced treatment of heterogeneous data, improving both parameter estimation and convergence robustness. We show that the resulting weighted Levenberg-Marquardt method yields more physically consistent fits for both raw and smoothed datasets, using experimental data for ${}^{148}$Sm as a representative example. Additionally, we introduce a geometric scaling strategy to accelerate convergence -- a method based on the local geometry of the manifold.

An optical-lensing inspired data thinning method for nuclear cross section data

Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)
In the study of nuclear cross sections, the computational demands of data assimilation methods can become prohibitive when dealing with large data sets. We have developed a novel variant of the data thinning algorithm, inspired by the principles of optical lensing, which effectively reduces data volume while preserving critical information. We show how it improves fitting through a toy problem and for several examples of total cross sections for neutron-induced reactions on rare-earth isotopes. We demonstrate how this method can be applied as an efficient pre-processing step prior to smoothing, significantly improving computational efficiency without compromising the quality of uncertainty quantification.

Information geometry is a study of applying differential geometry methods to challenging statistical problems, such as uncertainty quantification. In this work, we use information geometry to study how measurement uncertainties in pre-neutron emission mass distributions affect the parameter estimation in the Hauser-Feshbach fission fragment decay code, CGMF. We quantify the impact of reduced uncertainties on the pre-neutron mass yield of specific masses to these parameters, for spontaneous fission of ${}^{252}$Cf, first using a toy model assuming Poissonian uncertainties, then an experimental measurement taken from G√∂√∂k et al., 2014 in EXFOR. We achieved a reduction of up to $\sim15\%$ in CGMF parameter errors, predominantly in $w_0^{(1)}$ and $w_1^{(0)}$.

Title:
Decoding Dark Matter Admixed Neutron Stars: From Static Structure to Rotational Deformation

Comments:

Subjects:

In this study, we investigate the impacts of dark matter (DM) on the properties of both static and rotating neutron stars utilizing a self-interacting DM model, motivated by the neutron decay anomaly. DM-admixed NSs are modeled by assuming chemical equilibrium between ordinary matter and the dark sector, treating a single-fluid Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) framework. By treating the DM interaction strength ($G$) as a free parameter, we explore its influence on NS properties, considering a broad range of equations of state (EoSs). Using the mass-radius constraints from NICER pulsar measurements, we constrain the DM interaction strength for each EoS via a likelihood analysis. Extending this model to rotating NSs, we analyze how centrifugal forces associated with increasing angular velocity ($\Omega$) enhance both mass and radius, causing deformation. We assess the impact of DM on rotational deformation by calculating the eccentricity, highlighting the interplay between DM and rotational forces. Since both DM and rotation simultaneously influence NS properties, we compute the relative changes in mass and radius across varying $G$ and $\Omega$ values to quantify their combined effects.

A Universal Bound on QCD Axions from Supernovae

We identify a new production channel for QCD axions in supernova environments that contributes to axion emissivity for all models solving the strong CP problem. This channel arises at tree-level from a shift-symmetry-breaking operator constructed at next-to-leading order in Chiral Perturbation Theory. In scenarios where model-dependent derivative couplings to nucleons are absent, this sets the strongest model-independent constraint on the axion mass, improving on existing bounds by two orders of magnitude.

Theoretical characterisation of the barium II and radium II ions

Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)
Motivated by recent experimental advances, including the ongoing development of an optical atomic clock in singly ionised radium, we perform a detailed theoretical characterisation of Ra+ and its lighter analogue, Ba+. Both ions are of interest for precision studies, including for atomic parity violation and searches for new physics beyond the standard model. Using the all-orders correlation potential method, including Breit and radiative quantum electrodynamics corrections, we perform high-accuracy calculations of electric-dipole (E1), electric-quadrupole (E2), and magnetic-dipole (M1) transition matrix elements between the low-lying s, p, and d states of these ions, as well as the excited-state lifetimes, polarizabilities, magic wavelengths, and magnetic dipole (A) hyperfine structure constants. By combining lifetime measurements with precise theoretical ratios, we extract high-accuracy determinations of the s-d_1/2 and s-d_3/2 E2 matrix elements. By combining hyperfine measurements with atomic theory, we extract parameters of the nuclear magnetisation distribution (the Bohr-Weisskopf effect) for 135-, 137-Ba and 223-, 225-Ra. These results provide theoretical input for ongoing and future experimental programs in fundamental physics and precision metrology.
