Large particle sorters have potential applications in sorting microplastics and large biomaterials (>50 micrometer), such as tissues, spheroids, organoids, and embryos. Though great advancements have been made in image-based sorting of cells and particles (<50 micrometer), their translation for high-throughput sorting of larger biomaterials and particles (>50 micrometer) has been more limited. An image-based detection technique is highly desirable due to richness of the data (including size, shape, color, morphology, and optical density) that can be extracted from live images of individualized biomaterials or particles. Such a detection technique is label-free and can be integrated with a contact-free actuation mechanism such as one based on traveling surface acoustic waves (TSAWs). Recent advances in using TSAWs for sorting cells and particles (<50 micrometer) have demonstrated short response times (<1 ms), high biocompatibility, and reduced energy requirements to actuate. Additionally, TSAW-based devices are miniaturized and easier to integrate with an image-based detection technique. In this work, a high-throughput image-detection based large particle microfluidic sorting technique is implemented. The technique is used to separate binary mixtures of small and large polyethylene particles (ranging between ~45-180 micrometer in size). All particles in flow were first optically interrogated for size, followed by actuations using momentum transfer from TSAW pulses, if they satisfied the size cutoff criterion. The effect of control parameters such as duration and power of TSAW actuation pulse, inlet flow rates, and sample dilution on sorting efficiency and throughput was observed. At the chosen conditions, this sorting technique can sort on average ~4.9-34.3 particles/s (perform ~2-3 actuations/s), depending on the initial sample composition and concentration.

Coupled CFD-DEM model for dry powder inhalers simulation: validation and sensitivity analysis for the main model parameters

Subjects:
Applied Physics (physics.app-ph)
The use of computational techniques in the design of dry powder inhalers (DPI), as well as in unravelling the complex mechanisms of drug aerosolization, has increased significantly in recent years. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is used to study the air flow, inside the DPI, during the patient inspiratory act while discrete element methods (DEM) are used to simulate the dispersion and aerosolization of the drug product powder particles. In this work we discuss the possibility to validate a coupled CFD-DEM model for the NextHaler DPI device against previously published experimental data. The approximations and assumptions made are deeply discussed. The comparison between computational and experimental results is detailed both for fluid and powder flows. Finally, the potential and possible applications of a calibrated DPI model are discussed as well as the missing elements necessary to achieve a fully quantitatively predictive computational model.

Title:
Do we need an alternative to local gauge coupling to electromagnetic fields?
F. Minotti, G. Modanese
Comments:
21 pages, no figures
Subjects:
General Physics (physics.gen-ph)
The local gauge coupling through the recipe $\partial_\mu \psi \to \partial_\mu \psi + iqA_\mu \psi$ works perfectly well with Dirac spinors in QED and in the gauge theories of the Standard Model, but for scalar fields it has a peculiarity: it generates in the Lagrangian a coupling term $J_\mu A^\mu$ in which $J_\mu$ does not coincide with the conserved Nöther current associated to the global gauge symmetry. If we want to preserve a coupling through a conserved current, which is true for spinors and has definite physical grounds, one possibility is to renounce to the principle of local gauge symmetry and couple the fields to the extended electrodynamics by Aharonov-Bohm. No differences with the usual theory appear for fermion systems when strict local charge conservation applies. In particular, if we consider the non-relativistic quantum theory as the low-energy limit of the relativistic theory, we would expect no modifications of Schrödinger equation when applied to fermion systems. However, when scalar boson systems are considered, like Cooper pairs quasi-particles in superconductors, in the new formulation the electromagnetic (e.m.) fields include a source, additional to the usual conserved four-current, and, besides, the corresponding Schrödinger equation acquires a new term, proportional to $\mathbf{A}^2$, which leads to observable consequences, like a sizable change in the estimate of the magnetic penetration depth in superconductors, compatible with the experimental data.

Title:
Grassmann algebraic field theory, entanglement and fermionic hidden clocks
Han Geurdes
Subjects:
General Physics (physics.gen-ph)
With Grassmann algebra as fermions in a Feynman path-integral approach to field theory, the quantum correlation can be recovered. This means that a quantum field of Grassmann variables can explain the entanglement. In turn, this agrees with Einstein's ideas of field theory and local principles. Moreover, Grassmann variables can refer to an empirical reality like e.g. in QCD. Hence, a possible but still fictitious fermionic field in conjunction with the previously introduced hidden clocks as Einstein variables, likely describes this empirical reality.

Title:
A data-driven method to estimate contamination from light ion beam transmutation at colliders

Accelerator Physics (physics.acc-ph); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)
Collisions of relativistic light ions such as oxygen, neon, and magnesium, have been proposed as way to examine the system-size dependence of dynamics typically associated with the quark-gluon plasma produced in collisions of heavier ions such as xenon, gold, or lead. Recent efforts at both the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider and Large Hadron Collider have produced large datasets of proton-oxygen, oxygen-oxygen, and neon-neon collisions, catalyzing intense interest in experimental backgrounds associated with light ion collisions. In particular, electromagnetic dissociation of light ions while they are circulating in a collider can result in beam contamination that is difficult to simulate precisely. Here we propose a data-driven method for evaluating the potential impact of beam contaminants on physics analyses. The method exploits the time-dependence and smaller size of contaminant ion species to define control regions that can be used to quantify potential contamination effects. A simple model is used to illustrate the method and to study its robustness. This method can inform studies of recent LHC and RHIC data and could also be useful for future light ion programs at the LHC and beyond.

Subjects:
Medical Physics (physics.med-ph); Applied Physics (physics.app-ph)
This review discusses the current applications, advantages, and limitations of PBPK and PopPK models in radiopharmaceutical therapy (RPT). PBPK models simulate radiopharmaceutical kinetics by integrating prior physiological and drug parameter information, whereas PopPK models leverage population data to enhance individual dose estimation accuracy. Future directions include developing hybrid models, incorporating artificial intelligence, and establishing regulatory guidelines to promote their clinical adoption. Ultimately, these modeling strategies aim to enable precise, personalized RPT dosing, thereby improving therapeutic outcomes and safety.

Title:
High-sensitivity molecular spectroscopy of SrOH using magneto-optical trapping
Annika Lunstad, Hiromitsu Sawaoka, Zack Lasner, Abdullah Nasir, Mingda Li, Jack Mango, Rachel Fields, John M. Doyle
Subjects:
Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph)
Polyatomic molecules are projected to be powerful tools in searches for physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM), including new CP-violating (CPV) interactions and ultralight dark matter (UDM) particles. Certain degrees of freedom present in polyatomic molecules enhance the sensitivity of these searches, as well as reject systematic errors, but necessitate extensive high-precision spectroscopy to identify pathways for optical cycling and quantum state readout. Here we show how a magneto-optical trap (MOT) can be used to locate weak optical transitions and identify rovibronic states for optical cycling and quantum control. We demonstrate this spectroscopic approach with strontium monohydroxide (SrOH), which is a candidate for both CPV and UDM searches. We identify two new repumping transitions in SrOH and implement them in a deeper optical cycle to achieve 32400(4700) trapped molecules, a 4.5-fold increase over the previous, shallower cycle. In addition, we determine the energy spacing between the $X^{2}\Sigma^{+}(200)$ and $X^{2}\Sigma^{+}(03^10)$ vibrational manifolds of SrOH, confirming the existence of numerous low-frequency rovibrational transitions that are sensitive to temporal variations of the proton-to-electron mass ratio, a predicted effect of the existence of UDM.

Farmed landscapes provide a natural laboratory to test how management reshapes near-surface hydrodynamics. Combining distributed acoustic sensing with physics-based hydromechanical modeling, we tracked minute-resolution, meter-scale changes across experimental fields with controlled tillage and compaction histories. We find that dynamic capillary effects, rate-dependent suction stresses during wetting and drying, govern transient stiffness and moisture redistribution in disturbed soils, producing sharp post-rain velocity drops from near-surface saturation and large hysteretic velocity rebounds driven by evapotranspiration. By pairing a seismic rainfall proxy with a drainage closure, we invert velocity changes to estimate evapotranspiration, revealing how disturbance alters flux partitioning and storage. These results establish agroseismology as a non-invasive, extendable tool to uncover soil hydromechanics, explain why conventional farming intensifies variability, and provide new constraints for Earth system models, land management, and hazard resilience.

Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
The previously applied independent atom model (IAM) for highly charged ion-molecule collisions which implemented the suppression of multiple ionization and capture on the basis of geometric overlaps of cross-sectional areas representing ion-atom cross sections using a pixel counting method (PCM), [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 101}, 062709 (2020)] is extended to incorporate the possibility of multiple collisions within the molecule. This is accomplished on the basis of estimated mean free paths for sequential projectile-atom collisions. The IAM-PCM was demonstrated to be successful in describing proton-molecule collisions, and moderately-charged ion impact at high collision energies. The new model does agree with these results, but has important consequences for highly charged projectiles providing larger cross sections than IAM-PCM, but still well below the simple additivity rule results.

Pump-driven droplet electrohydrodynamics: deformation, pinch-off and recoalescence
Yuzhe Qin, Huaxiong Huang, Zilong Song, Shixin Xu
Subjects:
Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
We investigate pump-driven droplet electrohydrodynamics with an emphasis on deformation, pinch-off, and recoalescence. A thermodynamically consistent phase-field framework is developed that couples Nernst--Planck--Poisson electrodiffusion with incompressible Navier--Stokes--Cahn--Hilliard flow, and incorporates interfacial ionic pumps as prescribed surface fluxes. In the pump-free baseline, applied fields merely polarise the droplet and deformation is negligible. By contrast, surface-localised pumping drives the accumulation of positive ions within the droplet, elevates the interior potential, and generates non-uniform electric fields. The resulting Lorentz stresses stretch and displace the droplet, thin interfacial necks, and trigger pinch-off; the daughter droplets subsequently recoalesce, often after wall contact, yielding flattened remnants. In multiple-droplet settings, pump-induced charging produces lateral electrostatic repulsion and asymmetric deformation; under geometric confinement, crescent bending and star-like morphologies emerge. Shear-flow tests further show that a pumped droplet can be immobilised and ruptured while an unpumped neighbour is advected downstream, suggesting a route to sorting. Taken together, the results establish interfacial pumping as an internal actuation mechanism that robustly controls droplet morphology and dynamics across configurations.

Using Oral Exams in Physics and Astronomy Courses
Brian DiGiorgio Zanger
Comments:
Conditionally accepted by AJP
Subjects:
Physics Education (physics.ed-ph)
Oral exams were common historically across academia, though their popularity has recently fallen. Many argue against them as an assessment technique because they are vulnerable to bias and subjectivity, difficult to administer, and impractical in large college classes. I present a method for administering oral examinations in upper-level courses that mitigates some of the disadvantages. This method creates a rigid question structure meant to assess student mastery of material, have a well-defined grading structure to standardize evaluation, and be administered a constrained time limit to reduce workload in larger seminars. I emphasize holistic verbal communication and evaluation that is meant to mirror the talks and interviews that are common throughout a scientist's career.

Strain-level identification of viruses is critical for effective public health responses to potential outbreaks, yet current diagnostic methods often lack the necessary speed or sensitivity. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) offers great potential for fast and precise virus clarification through unique vibrational fingerprints of biological components. However, existing protocols typically operate outside of the tissue's transparent near-infrared (NIR) window, and are further limited by the intrinsic complexity of clinical viral samples, which complicates spectral analysis and recognition. Here, we report an artificial intelligence (AI)-empowered NIR-SERS platform that integrates machine learning with a rationally designed hybrid substrate: gold nanostars (AuNSt) coupled with gold-coated carbon nanotube arrays (AuCNT). This architecture generates highly localized plasmonic hot spots resonant tuned to NIR excitation, as confirmed by electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS), enabling effective signal amplification from viral components. Our system and protocols provide accurate classification of respiratory viruses, including influenza viruses and coronaviruses, not only at the type and subtype levels, but also the more challenging strain level. This approach overcomes the plasmonic mismatch in conventional SERS and the lack of generalizability in AI-driven diagnostics. It shows promise for enhancing rapid virus detection and identification of novel strains and outbreak response capabilities, thus potentially addressing critical challenges in global public health preparedness.

The SHG and SPDC output of a periodically poled bulk LBGO crystal is measured. The SHG efficiency is measured to be (3.52 +/- 0.04) x 10^-3 %/W. The SPDC output is temporally characterized by a Hanbury-Brown-Twiss interferometer; a maximum CAR of 244 and pair generation rate of (1.45 +/- 0.47) x 10^6 pairs s^-1 mW^-1 is measured. An EMICCD spectrometer is used to measure the spectral characteristics of the PP-LBGO source. Of the four gratings tested, one operational grating (poling period = 2.10 um) of the PP-LBGO device outputs a temperature tunable spectrum of entangled photon pairs centered at 532 nm with signal and idler photons being tunable from 507 to 556 nm, respectively. The work paves the way for future waveguided entangled photon sources reaching UV wavelengths using periodic poling.

In the 1970s, the renowned physicist Victor Weisskopf famously developed a research program to qualitatively explain properties of matter in terms of the fundamental constants of physics. But there was one type of matter prominently missing from Weisskopf's analysis: life. Here, we develop Weisskopf-style arguments demonstrating how the fundamental constants of physics can be used to understand the properties of living systems. By combining biophysical arguments and dimensional analysis, we show that vital properties of chemical self-replicators, such as growth yield, minimum doubling time, and minimum power consumption in dormancy, can be quantitatively estimated using fundamental physical constants. The calculations highlight how the laws of physics constrain chemistry-based life on Earth, and if it exists, elsewhere in our universe.

The low-level RF (LLRF) systems for linear accelerating structures are typically based on heterodyne architectures. The linear accelerators normally have many RF stations and multiple RF inputs and outputs for each station, so the complexity and size of the LLRF system grows rapidly when scaling up. To meet the design goals of being compact and affordable for future accelerators, or upgrading existing ones, we have developed and characterized the next generation LLRF (NG-LLRF) platform based on the RF system-on-chip (RFSoC) for S-band and C-band accelerating structures. The integrated RF data converters in RFSoC sample and generate the RF signals directly without any analogue mixing circuits, which significantly simplified the architecture compared with the conventional LLRF systems. We have performed high-power tests for the NG-LLRF with the S-band accelerating structure in the Next Linear Collider Test Accelerator (NLCTA) test facility at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and a C-band structure prototyped for Cool Cooper Collider (CCC). The NG-LLRF platform demonstrated pulse-to-pulse fluctuation levels considerably better than the requirements of the targeted applications and high precision and flexibility in generating and measuring the RF pulses. In this paper, the characterization results of the platform with different system architectures will be summarized and a selection of high-power test results of the NG-LLRF will be presented and analyzed.

Small-scale dynamos (SSDs) amplify magnetic fields in turbulent plasmas. Theory predicts nonlinear magnetic energy growth $E_\mathrm{mag} \propto t^{p_\mathrm{nl}}$, but this scaling has not been tested across flow regimes. Using a large ensemble of SSD simulations spanning sub- to supersonic turbulence, we find linear growth ($p_\mathrm{nl} = 1$) in subsonic flows and quadratic growth ($p_\mathrm{nl} = 2$) in supersonic flows. In all cases, we find a dynamo efficiency of $\sim 1/100$ and a duration $\Delta t \approx 20\,t_0$, with $t_0$ the turnover time, establishing the universal timescales and efficiencies of the nonlinear SSD across astrophysical and laboratory plasmas.

Medicine is evolving beyond therapy largely predicated on anatomical information and towards incorporating patient-specific molecular biomarkers of disease for more accurate diagnosis and effective treatment. The complementary combination of hyperpolarization by spin-lock induced crossing signal amplification by reversible exchange (SLIC SABRE) and low field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can enable accessible metabolic imaging to advance personalized medicine. Hyperpolarized 13C-enriched pyruvate has demonstrated utility for MRI of metabolism in cancer, heart disease and neurodegenerative disorders but has been restricted from widespread clinical adoption by a lack of access to affordable technology. Parahydrogen-based polarization techniques, paired with low-cost high-performance MRI at millitesla fields, offer a means of broadening the reach of metabolic imaging. Here we show results demonstrating in situ hyperpolarization of pyruvate at 6.5 mT by SLIC SABRE, followed by immediate readout without field cycling or sample shuttling. We achieve 13C signal enhancements several million times above thermal equilibrium at 6.5 mT, corresponding to polarization levels of approximately 3%. Leveraging this enhancement, we perform 13C MRI and acquire NMR spectra with resolution sufficient to distinguish chemical shifts between pyruvate isotopomers. These results show a viable pathway towards accessible metabolic imaging with hyperpolarized 13C MRI at ultra-low field.

Which Rope Breaks? A Study of Tension Distribution in Multi-Rope Systems

Subjects:
Physics Education (physics.ed-ph); Classical Physics (physics.class-ph); Popular Physics (physics.pop-ph)
We investigate the tension distribution in systems of mass-less ropes under different loading conditions. For a two-rope system, we demonstrate how the breaking scenario depends on the applied force dynamics: rapid pulling causes the lower rope to break, while gradual pulling leads to upper rope failure. Extending to a three-rope Y-shaped configuration, we identify a critical angle theta_C=60° that determines which rope breaks first. When the angle between the upper ropes exceeds this critical value, the upper ropes fail before the lower one. We further analyze how an attached mass at the junction point modifies this critical angle and establish maximum mass limits for valid solutions. Our results provide practical insights for introductory physics students understanding static forces and system stabilities.

The coupling of weather, sea-ice, ocean, and wave forecasting systems has been a long-standing research focus to improve Arctic forecasting systems and their realism and is also a priority of international initiatives such as the WMO research project PCAPS. The goal of the Svalbard Marginal Ice Zone 2025 Campaign (SvalMIZ-25) was to observe and better understand the complex interplay between atmosphere, waves, and sea-ice in the winter Marginal Ice Zone (MIZ) in order to advance predictive skill of coupled Arctic forecasting systems. The main objective has been to set up a network of observations with a spatial distribution that allows for a representative comparison between in situ observations and gridded model data. The observed variables include air and surface temperature, sea-ice drift, and wave energy spectra. With the support of the Norwegian Coast Guard, we participated in the research cruise with KV Svalbard from this http URL - this http URL 2025.

A theory of a new magnetodynamic effect describing the energy exchange between the degrees of freedom of a conducting cylinder moving in a helical magnetic field has been developed. The possibility of effectively converting the translational motion of the cylinder into its angular rotation around the system axis (translational-rotational conversion, TRC) has been demonstrated. A connection between this effect and the formation of helical trajectories of electrons in undulators in free electron lasers (FELs) and the inverse Faraday effect (IFE) has been revealed. In TRC, unlike many known effects associated with the interaction of a moving conductor with a magnetic field, the conductor has no electrical contact with any external circuit, which makes it especially attractive for various applications. The TRC is also possible in a magnetohydrodynamic flow moving along the axis of a helical magnetic field. The theory is formulated in the limit of large magnetic Reynolds numbers, which corresponds to a sufficiently fast motion of well-conducting objects. In this scenario, the dynamics of the system is described by a nonlinear pendulum equation or a nonlinear pendulum equation with a nonzero right-hand side. In the latter case, a system dynamic mode corresponding to phase lock can be implemented.

Optics (physics.optics)
Efficient and coherent conversion between microwave and optical signals is crucial for a wide range of applications, from quantum information processing to microwave photonics and radar systems. However, existing conversion techniques rely on cavity-enhanced interactions, which limit the bandwidth and calability. Here, we demonstrate the first multi-channel microwave-to-optics conversion by introducing a traveling-wave architecture that leverages a hybrid photonic-phononic waveguide on thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN). Our approach exploits continuous phase-matching rather than discrete resonances, enabling unprecedented operational bandwidths exceeding 40 nm in the optical domain and 250 MHz in the microwave domain. By harnessing the strong piezoelectric and photoelastic effects of TFLN, we achieve coherent conversion between 9 GHz microwave photons and 1550 nm telecom photons via traveling phonons, with an internal efficiency of 2.2% (system efficiency 2.4 *10^-4 ) at room temperature. Remarkably, we demonstrate simultaneous operation of nine conversion channels in a single device. Our converter opens up new opportunities for seamless integration of microwave and photonic technologies, enabling the quantum interface for distributed quantum computing with superconducting quantum processors, high efficient microwave signal processing, and advanced radar applications.

We address the problem of automatic synchronisation of the spintronic oscillator (STO) by means of reinforcement learning (RL). A numerical solution of the macrospin Landau-Lifschitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski equation is used to simulate the STO and we train the two types of RL agents to synchronise with a target frequency within a fixed number of steps. We explore modifications to this base task and show an improvement in both convergence and energy efficiency of the synchronisation that can be easily achieved in the simulated environment.

Nonlinear optimal perturbation growth in pulsatile pipe flow
Patrick Keuchel, Marc Avila
Subjects:
Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
Pulsatile fluid flows through straight pipes undergo a sudden transition to turbulence that is extremely difficult to predict. The difficulty stems here from the linear Floquet stability of the laminar flow up to large Reynolds numbers, well above experimental observations of turbulent flow. This makes the instability problem fully nonlinear and thus dependent on the shape and amplitude of the flow perturbation, in addition to the Reynolds and Womersley numbers and the pulsation amplitude. This problem can be tackled by optimizing over the space of all admissible perturbations to the laminar flow. In this paper, we present an adjoint optimization code, based on a GPU implementation of the pseudo-spectral Navier-Stokes solver nsPipe, which incorporates an automatic, optimal check-pointing strategy. We leverage this code to show that the flow is susceptible to two distinct instability routes: One in the deceleration phase, where the flow is prone to oblique instabilities, and another during the acceleration phase with similar mechanisms as in steady pipe flow. Instability is energetically more likely in the deceleration phase. Specifically, localised oblique perturbations can optimally exploit nonlinear effects to gain over nine orders of magnitude in energy at a peak Reynolds number of $Re_{\max}\approx 4000$. These oblique perturbations saturate into regular flow patterns that decay in the acceleration phase or break down to turbulence depending on the flow parameters. In the acceleration phase, optimal perturbations are substantially less amplified, but generally trigger turbulence if their amplitude is sufficiently large.

We report X-ray Thomson scattering measurements of warm dense aluminium at densities 3.75-4.5 g/cm$^3$ and a temperature of approximately 0.6 eV, performed at the HED-HiBEF instrument of the European XFEL using the DiPOLE-100X drive laser. By probing plasmon dispersion across momentum transfers $k$ = 0.99-2.57 Angstrom$^{-1}$ with high statistical fidelity, we directly test competing theories of electron dynamics under extreme conditions. Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) reproduces both the observed plasmon energies and spectral shapes across the full $k$ range, whereas the random phase approximation (RPA) and static local-field-correction (LFC) models systematically overestimate the plasmon frequency, even for aluminium (a canonical uniform electron gas metal). Considering electron localisation around ions and the loss of crystalline symmetry due to liquid-state disorder, our measurements provide direct evidence that simple uniform electron gas models fail in warm dense matter and establish TDDFT as a reliable approach for electronic correlations in this regime.

Density-Functional Tight Binding Meets Maxwell: Unraveling the Mysteries of (Strong) Light-Matter Coupling Efficiently

Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
Controlling chemical and material properties through strong light-matter coupling in optical cavities has gained considerable attention over the past decade. However, the underlying mechanisms remain insufficiently understood, and a significant gap persists between experimental observations and theoretical descriptions. This challenge arises from the intrinsically multi-scale nature of the problem, where non-perturbative feedback occurs across different spatial and temporal scales. Collective coupling between a macroscopic ensemble of molecules and a photonic environment, such as Fabry-Perot cavity, can strongly influence the microscopic properties of individual molecules, while microscopic details of the ensemble in turn affect the macroscopic coupling. To address this complexity, we present an efficient computational framework that combines density-functional tight binding (DFTB) with finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations for Maxwell's equations (DFTB+Maxwell). This approach allows for a self-consistent treatment of both the cavity and microscopic details of the molecular ensemble. We demonstrate the potential for this method by tackling several open questions. First, we calculate non-perturbatively two-dimensional spectroscopic observable that directly connect to well-established experimental protocols. Second, we provide local, molecule-resolved information within collectively coupled ensembles, which is difficult to obtain experimentally. Third, we show how cavity designs can be optimized to target specific microscopic applications. Finally, we outline future directions to enhance the predictive power of this framework, including extension to finite temperature, condensed phases, and correlated quantum effects.

Optical tweezers assisted coupling of nematic droplets to gold nanoparticle cluster: Effect on whispering gallery modes
Sumant Pandey, G. V. Pavan Kumar
Subjects:
Optics (physics.optics); Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)
Dye doped liquid crystal (LC) microdroplets exhibit tunable optical resonances modulated by size, shape, temperature, and external perturbations. When a dye-doped nematic microdroplet is coupled to a gold nanoparticle cluster, near-field interactions enhance local electric fields, boosting fluorescence emission. Optical tweezers serve as a tool for the parking of dye doped nematic microdroplets on gold nanoparticle clusters, enabling the dynamic coupling and excitation of whispering-gallery modes (WGMs). This configuration resulted in amplified WGMs, with a clearly detectable shift in the spectral position. Resonance mode red shifts confirmed efficient photonic plasmonic coupling, with up to seven nm tunability achieved without significant degradation of the Q-factor. The magnitude of tunability depends on the size of the gold nanoparticle cluster. Also, the WGM emission spectrum of the nematic microdroplet can be reversibly tuned by decoupling from the gold nanoparticle cluster.

In several capillary dynamics experiments, the liquid domain is confined by pinning the three-phase contact line along a sharp edge or a discontinuity on the substrate. Simulating the dynamics of pinned droplets can offer valuable insights into capillary flow phenomena involving wetting of inhomogeneous substrates. However, Eulerian multi-phase flow solvers are usually not able to directly implement pinning of three-phase contact lines. We present the implementation of a model for pinning the contact line of a liquid along an arbitrary pinning curve on the substrate, in an updated Lagrangian, meshless flow solver based on the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method. We develop the pinning model for a continuum surface force scheme and assume a free surface for the liquid-gas interface. We validate the model against several capillary dynamics experiments involving pinned three phase contact lines with fixed and dynamic substrates to demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of the solver.

Convective flux analysis on the instability of one-dimensional detonation

Subjects:
Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
One-dimensional numerical simulations using the Euler equations and irreversible one-step Arrhenius kinetics are conducted to study the instability mechanism of a one-dimensional gaseous detonation. By increasing the activation energy, this study identifies the characteristics of stable detonation, periodic detonation, pulsating detonation, and detonation quenching. The key difference between this study and previous research is that it is the first quantitative analysis of convective flux, kinetic energy flux, and chemical reaction heat flux. These three fluxes undergo intensive change on the detonation front and the flow field at each time step depends on the algebra summation of them. The mechanisms of detonation instability, detonation reignition and detonation quenching process can be revealed quantitatively by analyzing these fluxes.

A novel method for measuring the Fermi velocity of elemental targets

Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph)
The right kind of theoretical treatment of direct Coulomb ionization of inner-shell of target atoms including multiple ionization of their outer-shells by using accurate x-ray fluorescence yield data and electron capture by projectile ions from inner-shell electrons of target atoms enables us to fully understand the complex physics issues with the heavy-ion-induced inner-shell ionization phenomenon. Such great success has only been achieved recently [Phys. Rev. A 111 (2025) 042827]. Aftermath, further investigations exhibit such a picture only if the Fermi velocity of the elemental target is accurate, as it takes a significant role in correct evaluation of charge-state distribution of the projectile ions inside the target, which contributes an invaluable share in calculating the electron capture-induced ionization cross section correctly. In this work, we devise a powerful method that enables us to measure the correct and accurate Fermi velocity for almost every elemental metal in the periodic table. As per our present knowledge, this in turn not only improves our understanding of the said complex physics issues one step ahead but also helps move toward further miniaturization of integrated circuits and use the heavy-ion-induced X-ray emission in impurity analysis more reliable and accurate.

It is shown how the optimal detector of Gaussian signals can be represented in terms of Bertrand's class of time-frequency distributions. In this representation, the detector is a correlation between the corresponding time-frequency distributions. Since Bertrand's class is related to the power-law chirp signals, the new representation can be useful for their detection. The new approach is shown to be more effective then other time-frequency methods for the case of phase-insensitive detection. The finding provides a complementary representation to Cohen's class representation in the time-frequency domain already known in the literature.

Low-Frequency Scattering of TE and TM Waves by an Inhomogeneous Medium with Planar Symmetry

Comments:

Subjects:
Optics (physics.optics); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
Stationary scattering of TE and TM waves propagating in an isotropic medium with planar symmetry is described by Bergmann's equation in one dimension. This is a generalization of Helmholtz equation which allows for developing transfer matrix methods to deal with the corresponding scattering problems. We use a dynamical formulation of stationary scattering to study the low-frequency scattering of these waves when the inhomogeneities of the medium causing the scattering are confined to a planar slab. This formulation relies on the construction of an effective two-level non-Hermitian quantum system whose time-evolution operator determines the transfer matrix. We use it to construct the low-frequency expansions of the transfer matrix and the reflection and transmission coefficients of the medium, introduce a generalization of Brewster's angle for inhomogeneous slabs at low frequencies, and derive analytic conditions for transparency and reflectionlessness of PT-symmetric and non-PT-symmetric slabs at these frequencies. We also discuss the application of this method to deal with the low-frequency scattering of TE and TM waves when the carrier medium occupies a half-space and the waves satisfy boundary conditions with planar symmetry at the boundary of the half-space. Because acoustic waves propagating in a compressible fluid with planar symmetry are also described by Bergmann's equation, our results apply to the low-frequency scattering of these waves.

Subjects:
Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph)
The local rules of Wolfram cellular automata with one-dimensional three-cell neighborhoods are represented by eight-bit binary that encode deterministic update rules. These automata are widely utilized to investigate self-organization phenomena and the dynamics of complex systems. In this work, we employ numerical simulations and computational methods to investigate the asymptotic density and dynamical evolution mechanisms in Wolfram automata. We apply both supervised and unsupervised learning methods to identify the configurations associated with different Wolfram rules. Furthermore, we explore alternative initial conditions under which certain Wolfram rules generate similar fractal patterns over time, even when starting from a single active site. Our results reveal the relationship between the asymptotic density and the initial density of selected rules. The supervised learning methods effectively identify the configurations of various Wolfram rules, while unsupervised methods like principal component analysis and autoencoders can approximately cluster configurations of different Wolfram rules into distinct groups, yielding results that align well with simulated density outputs.

Laser-induced damage is a serious challenge for optical components; therefore, determining the laser-induced damage threshold (LIDT) is a crucial step in the manufacturing process. In many cases, such as for space applications, it is also necessary to account for the vacuum environment. Since conventional damage detection methods face limitations under vacuum conditions, an alternative approach is required. This article introduces a He-Ne laser imaging system designed for in-situ damage detection within a LIDT station. The system enables fourfold magnification imaging of the test sample and its surroundings without placing imaging optics inside the vacuum chamber, thereby preserving the cleanliness of the chamber. The detection method can be applied to both transparent and opaque samples; in transparent optics, damage is observable from either side. To verify the system's functionality, two sample types were investigated: a silica wafer (non-transparent for He-Ne radiation) and a commonly used dielectric mirror for 1030 nm (transparent for He-Ne radiation). Particular attention was devoted to determining the minimum damage size that can be reliably recognized. The system successfully distinguished damage features as small as 35 ${\mu}$m.

Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics (physics.ao-ph)
The winter Arctic Oscillation (AO) modulates East Asian climate and the East/Japan Sea (EJS), yet local, scale-dependent air-sea couplings linking atmosphere, ocean and sea-surface temperature anomalies (SSTA) remain unclear. Using 30 years of daily fields (1993--2022), we compute detrended fluctuation/cross-correlation metrics over 5--50-day scales at every grid: the Hurst exponent ($H$), the cross-Hurst exponent ($\lambda$), and the DCCA coefficient ($\rho_{DCCA}$). Significance is assessed with iterative-AAFT surrogates and Benjamini--Hochberg false-discovery-rate control. Three robust features emerge. (1) During AO+ winters, the EKB--SPF corridor exhibits high SSTA variance and near-ballistic persistence ($H \approx 1.4$--$1.5$), indicating increased susceptibility to marine heatwaves. (2) SSTA co-fluctuates positively with near-surface air-temperature anomalies, whereas turbulent heat-flux anomalies are largely anti-phased and show negligible cross-persistence, consistent with fast damping. (3) Oceanic fields impart persistent coupling: sea-surface height anomalies display basin-wide positive links with SSTA; meridional geostrophic velocity imprints advective cross-coupling along EKWC/SPF pathways, while zonal flow and vorticity yield patchy signatures. Winter SST variability in the EJS thus reflects a two-tier process in which mesoscale structure and along-front advection organize persistence, while synoptic forcing and turbulent heat exchange supply strong but non-persistent tendencies. The FDR-controlled, grid-point DFA/DCCA framework is transferable to other marginal seas.

Visualising the free surface of superfluid helium offers a rare opportunity to explore wave dynamics in the limit of vanishing viscosity. Such measurements are nonetheless challenging due to helium's low refractive index contrast, restricted optical access to the cryogenic setups required to maintain helium in its superfluid phase, and mechanical vibrations from the various cooling stages. Overcoming these limitations will enable quantitative studies of surface-wave dynamics with applications in fluid mechanics, quantum simulation, and quantum optomechanics. Here we report the first implementation of off-axis digital holography for full-field imaging of the free surface of superfluid $^{\text{4}}$He. We perform non-contact measurements of nanometre- to micrometre-scale interface fluctuations in two cryogenic systems: a traditional helium bath cryostat and a cryogen-free refrigerator. We employ machine-learning-based analysis to isolate noise-driven normal modes and their spatial structure in both systems. This enables reconstruction of the dispersion relation for gravity-capillary waves in macroscopic samples and, for thick films, determination of the film thickness from the measured dispersion, providing a quantitative benchmark for our approach. These proof-of-concept experiments show that digital holography is a powerful and versatile tool for high-resolution, minimally invasive studies of superfluid surfaces, with strong potential for integration into diverse experimental platforms.

The horizontal dynamics of a bouncing ball interacting with an irregular surface is investigated and is found to demonstrate behavior analogous to a random walk. Its stochastic character is substantiated by the calculation of a permutation entropy. The probability density function associated with the particle positions evolves to a Gaussian distribution, and the second moment follows a power-law dependence on time, indicative of diffusive behavior. The results emphasize that deterministic systems with complex geometries or nonlinearities can generate behavior that is statistically indistinguishable from random. Several problems are suggested to extend the analysis.

Experimental study of turbulent mixing in a T-shaped mixer

Subjects:
Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
One of the most widespread canonical devices for fluid mixing is the T-shaped mixer, in which two opposing miscible liquid streams meet at a junction and then mix along a main channel. Laminar steady and time-periodic flows in T-shaped mixers have been thoroughly studied, but turbulent flows have received much less scrutiny despite their prevalence in applications. We here introduce a novel experimental setup with a hydraulic diameter of four centimetres that enables the optical study of turbulent mixing at small scales. Using this setup, we perform two-dimensional particle image velocimetry and planar laser-induced fluorescence measurements. First, we successfully replicate characteristic flow regimes observed in micro-scale T-shaped mixers at low Reynolds numbers. We then focus on the turbulent regime and characterize the turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation along the mixing channel. Further, we measure the scalar concentration variance and its corresponding probability density function and spectra. The latter exhibits an incipient Batchelor scaling. We estimate the mechanical-to-scalar timescale ratio and examine the link between the turbulent velocity and scalar fields. The measurement data are compared with model predictions and correlations used in engineering practice, and with our own direct numerical simulations performed with a spectral-element code.

Subjects:
Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph)
Machine learning force fields possess unprecedented potential in achieving both accuracy and efficiency in molecular simulations. Nevertheless, their application in organic systems is often hindered by structural collapse during simulation and significant deviations in the prediction of macroscopic properties. Here, two physics-embedded strategies are introduced to overcome these limitations. First, a physics-inspired self-adaptive bond-length sampling method achieves long-timescale stable simulations by requiring only several tens of single-molecule data sets, and has been validated across molecular systems, including engineering fluids, polypeptides, and pharmaceuticals. Second, a top-down intermolecular correction strategy based on a physical equation is introduced. This strategy requires only a small amount of simulation data and completes the optimization of tunable parameters within a few hours on a single RTX 4090 GPU, significantly reducing errors in density and viscosity, as validated in systems including ethylene carbonate, ethyl acetate, and dimethyl carbonate. Together, these approaches directly integrate physical insights into the machine learning models, thereby enhancing robustness and generalizability, and providing a scalable pathway for physics-embedded machine learning force fields.

Understanding how living organisms spontaneously develop complex functional structures inspires innovative approaches in engineering design. Here, we introduce a decentralized generative model based on morphogenesis to autonomously grow mechanical structures with controlled tensorial properties. By adapting Turing's reaction-diffusion concept through anisotropic diffusion, our approach enables the local emergence of microstructures exhibiting tailored stiffness and anisotropy, achieving target orthotropic tensors without adjoint or topology optimization loops. The synthesis of these structures relies on a database linking morphogenetic parameters to effective elastic tensors obtained through homogenization techniques. We experimentally demonstrate this concept through a mechanical cloaking example, validating our method's capability to independently control local anisotropy and rigidity, and effectively conceal structural defects from mechanical fields. This approach not only addresses key limitations of traditional topology optimization methods but also opens new bio-inspired pathways for scalable and robust mechanical metamaterial design.

Cerebral autoregulation (CA) is a fundamental mechanism that modulates cerebrovascular resistance, primarily by regulating the diameter of small cerebral vessels to maintain stable cerebral blood flow (CBF) in response to fluctuations in systemic arterial pressure. However, the clinical understanding of CA remains limited due to the intricate structure of the cerebral vasculature and the challenges in accurately quantifying the hemodynamic and physiological parameters that govern this autoregulatory process. Method: In this study, we introduced a novel numerical algorithm that employs three partial differential equations and one ordinary differential equation to capture both the spatial and temporal distributions of key CA-driving factors, including the arterial pressure (P) and the partial pressures of oxygen (PO_2) and carbon dioxide (PCO_2) within the cerebral vasculature, together with a Windkessel model in turn to regulate the CBF based on the calculated P, PO_2, and PCO_2. This algorithm was sequentially integrated with our previously developed personalized 0D-1D multi-dimensional model to account for the patient-specific effects. Results: The integrated framework was rigorously validated using two independent datasets, demonstrating its high reliability and accuracy in capturing the regulatory effects of CA on CBF across a range of physiological conditions. Conclusion: This work significantly advances our understanding of CA and provides a promising foundation for developing hemodynamic-based therapeutic strategies aimed at improving clinical outcomes in patients with cerebrovascular disorders.

The persistent underrepresentation of women and gender minorities within the physical sciences remains a significant issue. This study investigates gender dynamics in introductory algebra-based physics laboratories, focusing on participation, task preferences, and comfort levels. Statistical analysis revealed no significant gender difference in overall participation rates during lab activities. However, significant gender-based disparities emerged in both task preference (\(\chi^2 = 9.548,~ p = 0.023\)) and comfort levels (\(\chi^2 = 7.906,~ p = 0.048\)). Male students significantly preferred and felt more comfortable with hands-on equipment handling and data collection, whereas female students more frequently preferred and reported higher comfort with analytical and documentation tasks like note-taking, calculations, and report writing. Qualitative responses highlighted additional challenges reported by some women, including exclusion from group discussions and reluctance to contribute ideas in male-dominated groups. These findings suggest that while overall participation may appear gender-neutral, gendered patterns in task allocation and comfort persist. The results underscore the need for instructional strategies that promote equitable engagement and foster inclusive laboratory environments in physics education.

The sensitivity of mechanical resonators to physical quantities such as acceleration, pressure, mass and temperature enables them to underpin sensing and metrology applications. Here, we observe that the resonance frequency of a nanomechanical resonator depends strongly on charging. We show that repulsion between an electron beam and charge accumulated on a nanomechanical cantilever yields a stiffening that increases its resonance frequency, providing a mechanism for controlling resonators and sensing charge. For a cantilever of microscale length and nanoscale cross-section interacting with the electron beam of a scanning electron microscope, we observe a resonance shift on the order of 1% per nanocoulomb.

Vibrational frequencies and stark tuning rate with continuum electro-chemical models and grand canonical density functional theory

Subjects:
Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph)
Simulating electrochemical interfaces using density functional theory (DFT) requires incorporating the effects of electrochemical potential. The electrochemical potential acts as a new degree of freedom that can effectively tune DFT results as electrochemistry does. Typically, this is implemented by adjusting the number of electrons on the solid surface within the Kohn-Sham (KS) equation, under the framework of an implicit solvent model and the Poisson-Boltzmann equation (PB equation), thereby modulating the potential difference between the solid and liquid. These simulations are often referred to as grand-canonical or fixed-potential DFT calculations. To apply this additional degree of freedom, Legendre transforms are employed in the calculation of free energy, establishing the relationship between the grand potential and the free energy. Other key physical properties, such as atomic forces, vibrational frequencies, and Stark tuning rates, can be derived based on this relationship rather than directly using Legendre transforms. This paper begins by discussing the numerical methodologies for the continuum model of electrolyte double layers and grand-potential algorithms. We then show that atomic forces under grand-canonical ensemble match the Hellmann-Feynman forces observed in canonical ensemble, as previously established. However, vibrational frequencies and Stark tuning rates exhibit distinct behaviors between these conditions. Through finite displacement methods, we confirm that vibrational frequencies and Stark tuning rates exhibit differences between grand-canonical and canonical ensembles.

Most Western African migrants remain local and travel short distances

Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph)
Migration patterns are complex and context-dependent, with the distances migrants travel varying greatly depending on socio-economic and demographic factors. While global migration studies often focus on Western countries, there is a crucial gap in our understanding of migration dynamics within the African continent, particularly in West Africa. Using data from over 60,000 individuals from eight West African countries, this study examines the determinants of migration distance in the region. Our analysis reveals a bimodal distribution of migration distances: while most migrants travel locally within a hundred km, a smaller yet significant portion undertakes long-distance journeys, often exceeding 3,000 km. Socio-economic factors such as employment status, marital status and level of education play a decisive role in determining migration distances. Unemployed migrants, for instance, travel substantially farther (1,467 km on average) than their employed counterparts (295 km). Furthermore, we find that conflict-induced migration is particularly variable, with migrants fleeing violence often undertaking longer and riskier journeys. Our findings highlight the importance of considering both local and long-distance migration in policy decisions and support systems, as well as the need for a comprehensive understanding of migration in non-Western contexts. This study contributes to the broader discourse on human mobility by providing new insights into migration patterns in Western Africa, which in turn has implications for global migration research and policy development.

Subjects:
Optics (physics.optics)
Significant efforts have been devoted to manipulating topological states, which often manifest as localized modes at interfaces between distinct topological phases. In this work, we demonstrate a versatile approach to sculpting topological modes (TMs) into any desired shapes by incorporating various artificial gauge fields (AGFs), including scalar, vector, and imaginary gauge potentials, and leveraging the power of artificial neural networks (ANNs). These AGFs enable precise tuning of the dissipation of the TMs across that of bulk modes, facilitating a transition from localized to fully delocalized states. Moreover, ANNs allow precise engineering of these eigenmodes to achieve tailored profiles of topological states, which remain spectrally isolated within the bandgap and exhibit minimal loss compared to other modes. Our theoretical results are experimentally validated on silicon photonic platforms, demonstrating flexible manipulation of TM profiles. This approach enables the design of topological states with customized properties, offering significant potential for diverse applications in photonics and beyond.

Lagrangian Stability Analysis Technique for Fluid Flows

Subjects:
Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
Flow transition from a stable to unstable states and eventually to turbulence is a classical fluid mechanics phenomenon with a strong practical relevance. Conventional hydrodynamic stability deals with perturbation dynamics on a steady baseflow, typically in Eulerian reference frame. Common modal techniques, e.g., linear stability theory, involve linearization of governing flow equations and flow/geometrical simplifications, which can be tedious and restrictive. This paper presents a perturbation-free data-driven stability analysis technique by employing Lagrangian modal/non-modal analysis (Shinde & Gaitonde 2021), particularly the adjoint form of Lagrangian dynamics mode decomposition in the forward time direction. The proposed Lagrangian stability analysis technique (LagSAT) builds on the fact that a steady non-uniform fluid flow in the Eulerian reference frame can be perceived as an unsteady flow in the Lagrangian reference frame. LagSAT is demonstrated on classical baseflows that exhibit convective/absolute instabilities, namely, the self-similar Blasius/Falkner-Skan boundary layers, a 2D compressible flow past a cylinder, and a 2D compressible lid-driven cavity flow, producing neutral stability curves, N-factor estimate, and transient energy growth. LagSAT is naturally suitable for the global analysis of large/complex numerical/experimental baseflows with multiphysics effects.

The FAMU experiment, supported and funded by the Italian Institute of Nuclear Physics (INFN) and by the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC), aims to perform the first measurement of the ground-state hyperfine splitting (1S-hfs) of muonic hydrogen ($\mu H$). This quantity is highly sensitive to the proton's Zemach radius $R_Z$. An experimental determination of $R_Z$ provides significant constraints on the parametrization of the proton form factors as well as on theoretical models describing the proton's electromagnetic structure. Following years of technological and methodological development, the FAMU experiment began operations in 2023 at Port 1 of the RIKEN-RAL muon beam line at the ISIS Neutron and Muon Source facility (Didcot, UK). In this paper, we first describe the unique detection technique employed by FAMU to determine the 1S-hfs of muonic hydrogen, followed by a detailed presentation of the final experimental layout. Finally, we report the first outcome from the 2023 commissioning run and from the initial physics runs performed in 2023 and 2024.

Goos-H$\ddot{a}$nchen shift of normally incident optical beam to meta-grating consisted of magneto-optical material are studied. The meta-grating is consisted of compound grating of magneto-optical rod on top of a dielectric slab, which induces zone-folding quasi-bound states in the continuum at the $\Gamma$ point with non-zero group velocity. By applying stationary-phase theory, the Goos-H$\ddot{a}$nchen shift of normally incident quasi-plane wave are found to be enhanced at the reflection peak. Simulations of normally incident Gaussian beam with finite beam width show that the Goos-H$\ddot{a}$nchen shift is dependent on the beam width.

Optical branched flow in nonlocal nonlinear medium

When light propagates through a randomly correlated, slowly varying medium, it generates optical branched flow. Previous studies have demonstrated that the self-focusing effect in optical media can accelerate the appearance of the first branching points and sharpen the filaments of branched flow. In this study, we investigate the influence of the nonlocality of the nonlinear response on branched flow. We find that, due to its averaging effect, as the range of nonlocality increases, the first branching point shifts to a greater distance, and the flow structures broaden, thus nonlocality ultimately restores the branched flow to its linear condition. We have developed a semi-analytical formula and confirmed the screening of the self-focusing effect on branching flow by nonlocality.

Lightning plays a crucial role in the Earth's climate system, yet existing parameterizations for use in forecasting and earth system models show room for improvement in capturing spatial and temporal variations in its frequency. This study develops deep learning-based parameterizations of lightning stroke density using meteorological variables from the ERA and IMERG datasets. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with U-Net architectures are trained using World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN) data from 2010 to 2021 and evaluated on WWLLN lightning observations from 2022 and 2023. The CNNs reduce the average domain mean bias by an order of magnitude and produce significantly higher Fractions Skill Score (FSS) values across all lightning regimes compared to the multiplicative product of CAPE and precipitation. The CNNs show skill relative to previously published parameterizations over the oceans especially, with r2 values as high as 0.93 achieved between the best performing modeled and observed lightning stroke density climatologies. The CNNs are also able to accurately capture the 12-hourly evolution of lightning spatial patterns on an event-scale with high skill. These results show the potential for deep learning to improve on lightning parameterizations in weather and earth system models.

A Review of the Design of Cone-Cylinder-Flare Geometries for Stability Analyses and Conventional/Quiet Wind Tunnel Tests

Subjects:
Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
In order to study the effects of pressure gradients, flow expansion, and recompression on the stability of hypersonic boundary-layers, axisymmetric cone-cylinder-flare configurations have been specifically designed for wind tunnel experiments. The objective is to create well-suited geometries for hypersonic laminar-turbulent transition analyses, while also adding the capability to generate attached and separated flows. After a thorough review of the aerodynamic flows obtained at Mach 6 and zero degree angle of attack in fully laminar conditions on each configuration, linear stability theory (LST) and linear parabolized stability equations (PSE) are used to predict the amplification rates of the boundary-layer disturbances for the case without flow separation since local stability analysis cannot handle highly non-parallel flows. For this attached flow case, the numerical stability results are compared to wind tunnel measurements obtained in the BAM6QT (Boeing AFOSR Mach-6 Quiet Tunnel). The semi-empirical method based on N-factor allows to correlate transition with the integrated growth of the linear instability waves. The influence of tunnel noise is also investigated, using conventional and quiet experiments.

Cryosurgery employs a safe and relatively simple technique of exposure and is an advantageous and highly rated method. For its effective application, it is necessary to control both the volume of the expanding freezing zone and volumetric thermal field dynamics. The aim of this study was to perform a thermal imaging study of freezing and thawing in a model system (gel phantom) to predict the dynamics of the freezing zone during cryodestruction of biological tissues in vivo. Here, the thermal imager is an effective tool for demonstrating the surface temperature distribution. We have studied how the observed infrared image relates to the distribution and change of the thermal field in depth. For this purpose, we created test measuring equipment for simultaneous analysis of the dynamics of thermal fields on the surface, video recording of freezing and thawing on the surface as well as in the depth of the gel phantom, measuring the temperature at any given point in the depth and modeling in the zone of low-temperature exposure of vessels with different blood flow parameters. It was revealed that with a modeled vessel in the low-temperature exposure zone, the surface thermal fields deformed and they gained the shape of butterfly wings. Our experimental study in a gel phantom is supported by numerical calculations, demonstrating how the freezing zone and thermal isotherms on the surface and in depth evolve under real conditions, thereby providing a basis for assessing the cryoeffect time and intensity in practice. Key words: cryoapplication; freezing; thawing; temperature field dynamics; infrared thermography; gel phantom; testing measuring equipment; vessel simulation.

Composing $α$-Gauss and logistic maps: Gradual and sudden transitions to chaos

We introduce the $\alpha$-Gauss-Logistic map, a new nonlinear dynamics constructed by composing the logistic and $\alpha$-Gauss maps. Explicitly, our model is given by $x_{t+1} = f_L(x_t)x_t^{-\alpha} - \lfloor f_L(x_t)x_t^{-\alpha} \rfloor $ where $f_L(x_t) = r x_t (1-x_t)$ is the logistic map and $ \lfloor \ldots \rfloor $ is the integer part function. Our investigation reveals a rich phenomenology depending solely on two parameters, $r$ and $\alpha$. For $\alpha < 1$, the system exhibits multiple period-doubling cascades to chaos as the parameter $r$ is increased, interspersed with stability windows within the chaotic attractor. In contrast, for $1 \leq \alpha < 2$, the onset of chaos is abrupt, occurring without any prior bifurcations, and the resulting chaotic attractors emerge without stability windows. For $\alpha \geq 2$, the regular behavior is absent. The special case of $\alpha = 1$ allows an analytical treatment, yielding a closed-form formula for the Lyapunov exponent and conditions for an exact uniform invariant density, using the Perron-Frobenius equation. Chaotic regimes for $\alpha = 1$ can exhibit gaps or be gapless. Surprisingly, the golden ratio $\Phi$ marks the threshold for the disappearance of the largest gap in the regime diagram. Additionally, at the edge of chaos in the abrupt transition regime, the invariant density approaches a $q$-Gaussian with $q=2$, which corresponds to a Cauchy distribution.

This work investigates amplitude-dependent nonlinear corrections to the dissipative conductivity in superconductors, using the Keldysh-Usadel theory of nonequilibrium superconductivity, which captures the nonequilibrium dynamics of both quasiparticles and the pair potential. Our rigorous formulation naturally incorporates both the direct nonlinear action of the photon field and indirect contributions mediated by nonequilibrium variations in the pair potential, namely the Eliashberg effect and the Higgs mode. The third-harmonic current, often regarded as a hallmark of the Higgs mode, arises from both the direct photon action and the Higgs mode. Our numerical results are in excellent agreement with previous studies. In contrast, the first-harmonic current, and consequently the dissipative conductivity, receives contributions from all three mechanisms: the direct photon action, the Higgs mode, and the Eliashberg effect. It is shown that that the nonlinear correction to dissipative conductivity can serve as a fingerprint of the Higgs mode, appearing as a resonance peak at a frequency near the superconducting gap \( \Delta \). In addition, our results provide microscopic insight into amplitude-dependent dissipation at frequencies well below \( \Delta \), which is particularly relevant for applied superconducting devices. In particular, the long-standing issue concerning the frequency dependence of the amplitude-dependent quality factor is explained as originating from the direct nonlinear action of the photon field, rather than from contributions by the Higgs mode and the Eliashberg effect. Our practical and explicit expression for the nonlinear conductivity formula makes our results accessible to a broad range of researchers.

Deep Neural Networks can eliminate Spiral-wave Turbulence in Cardiac Tissue Models
Vasanth Kumar Babu, Rahul Pandit
Subjects:
Pattern Formation and Solitons (nlin.PS); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph)
Ventricular arrhythmias, like ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF), precipitate sudden cardiac death (SCD), which is the leading cause of mortality in the industrialised world. Thus, the elimination of VT and VF is a problem of paramount importance, which is studied experimentally, theoretically, and numerically. Numerical studies use partial-differential-equation models, for cardiac tissue, which admit solutions with spiral- or broken-spiral-wave solutions that are the mathematical counterparts of VT and VF. In silico investigations of such mathematical models of cardiac tissue allow us not only to explore the properties of such spiral-wave turbulence, but also to develop mathematical analogues of low-amplitude defibrillation by the application of currents that can eliminate spiral waves. We develop an efficient deep-neural-network U-Net-based method for the control of spiral-wave turbulence in mathematical models of cardiac tissue. Specifically, we use the simple, two-variable Aliev-Panfilov and the ionically realistic TP06 mathematical models to show that the lower the correlation length {\xi} for spiral-turbulence patterns, the easier it is to eliminate them by the application of control currents on a mesh electrode. We then use spiral-turbulence patterns from the TP06 model to train a U-Net to predict the sodium current, which is most prominent along thin lines that track the propagating front of a spiral wave. We apply currents, in the vicinities of the predicted sodium-current lines to eliminate spiral waves efficiently. The amplitudes of these currents are adjusted automatically, so that they are small when {\xi} is large and vice versa. We show that our U-Net-aided elimination of spiral-wave turbulence is superior to earlier methods.

Purpose: To study the relationship between soccer heading and the risk of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), we previously developed an instrumented headband and data processing scheme to measure the angular head kinematics of soccer headers. Laboratory evaluation of the headband on an anthropomorphic test device showed good agreement with a reference sensor for soccer ball impacts to the front of the head. In this study, we evaluate the headband in measuring the full head kinematics of soccer headers in the field. Methods: The headband was evaluated under typical soccer heading scenarios (throw-ins, goal-kicks, and corner-kicks) on a human subject. The measured time history and peak kinematics from the headband were compared with those from an instrumented mouthpiece, which is a widely accepted method for measuring head kinematics in the field. Results: The time history agreement (CORA scores) between the headband and the mouthpiece ranged from 'fair' to 'excellent', with the highest agreement for angular velocities (0.79 \pm 0.08) and translational accelerations (0.73 \pm 0.05) and lowest for angular accelerations (0.67 \pm 0.06). A Bland-Altman analysis of the peak kinematics from the headband and mouthpiece found the mean bias to be 40.9% (of the maximum mouthpiece reading) for the angular velocity, 16.6% for the translational acceleration, and-14.1% for the angular acceleration. Conclusion: The field evaluation of the instrumented headband showed reasonable agreement with the mouthpiece for some kinematic measures and impact conditions. Future work should focus on improving the headband performance across all kinematic measures.

Using both simulation and experiment, we investigate the robustness of dynamical decoupling sequences to pulse errors: rotation errors and detuning errors. Whereas prior work examined the effect of errors on coherence times, here we show that quantum sensing can be affected by pulse errors in dramatically different ways than coherence times alone. We also explore the effects of qubit leakage: off-resonant coupling to other quantum levels. We find order-of-magnitude differences between commonly-used dynamical decoupling sequences in both their sensitivity to pulse errors and leakage.

Diffusion/score-based models have recently emerged as powerful generative priors for solving inverse problems, including accelerated MRI reconstruction. While their flexibility allows decoupling the measurement model from the learned prior, their performance heavily depends on carefully tuned data fidelity weights, especially under fast sampling schedules with few denoising steps. Existing approaches often rely on heuristics or fixed weights, which fail to generalize across varying measurement conditions and irregular timestep schedules. In this work, we propose Zero-shot Adaptive Diffusion Sampling (ZADS), a test-time optimization method that adaptively tunes fidelity weights across arbitrary noise schedules without requiring retraining of the diffusion prior. ZADS treats the denoising process as a fixed unrolled sampler and optimizes fidelity weights in a self-supervised manner using only undersampled measurements. Experiments on the fastMRI knee dataset demonstrate that ZADS consistently outperforms both traditional compressed sensing and recent diffusion-based methods, showcasing its ability to deliver high-fidelity reconstructions across varying noise schedules and acquisition settings.

Magnonic Combinatorial Memory for High-density Data Storage

Subjects:
Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other); Applied Physics (physics.app-ph)
There is an urgent need to enhance the storage density of memory devices to accommodate the exponentially increasing amount of data generated by humankind. In this work, we describe Magnonic Combinatorial Memory (MCM), where the bits of information are stored in the signal propagation paths in the network. The number of paths among the elements of the network is much larger compared to the number of elements, which makes it possible to enhance the data storage density compared to conventional memory devices. MCM is an active ring circuit consisting of electric and magnonic parts. The electric part includes a broadband amplifier, phase shifters, and frequency filters. The magnonic part is a mesh of frequency-dependent elements. Signal propagation path(s) in the mesh depend on the amplitude/phase matching between the electric and magnetic parts. The operation of the MCM is described based on the network model, where information is encoded in the S-parameters of the network elements as well as in the element arrangement in the network. We present experimental data for MCM with a four-terminal magnonic element. The element consists of a single-crystal yttrium iron garnet Y3Fe2(FeO4)3 (YIG) film and magnets on top of the film. There are four micro antennas aimed to convert electromagnetic waves into spin waves and vice versa. One of the antennas is used as an input port while the other three are the output ports. Experimental data show the prominent dependence of the element S-parameters on the magnet arrangement. The number of possible arrangements scales factorially with the number of magnets. There is a number of bits that can be encoded into one magnet arrangement. The results demonstrate a robust operation of MCM with an On/Off ratio for path detection exceeding 50 dB at room temperature. Physical limits and practical constraints of MCM are also discussed.

No oscillating subradiant correlations in a strongly driven quantum emitter array

6 pages, 3 figures + End Matter
Subjects:
Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Optics (physics.optics)
We theoretically study time-dependent correlations in a strongly driven array of $N$ two-level atoms, coupled to photons in a waveguide. We focus on the spectrum $\{\lambda\}$ of the Liouvillian superoperator, which determines the correlation decay rates $-\Re \lambda$ and the frequencies $\Im\lambda$. Our main finding is the suppression of subradiant oscillating correlations between atomic states by a strong coherent of amplitude $\Omega$: $|\Re \lambda|\ge m\gamma/2$, where $\gamma$ is the single-atom spontaneous decay rate and $m=|\Im \lambda/(2\Omega)|$ is a nonzero integer for correlations oscillating in time $\propto \exp(\pm 2i m|\Omega| t)$. This limit is independent of the number of atoms $N$; it holds both for small arrays and in the macroscopic limit. We demonstrate the suppression of subradiance numerically and provide a rigorous proof based on the analytical decomposition of the Liouvillian using spectral theory of simplicial complexes and posets.

Donor-acceptor (D:A) cocrystals offer a promising platform for next-generation optoelectronic applications, but the impact of residual solvent molecules on their properties remains an open question. We investigate six novel D:A cocrystals of dibenzotetrathiafulvalene (DBTTF) and 1,4,5,8,9,11-hexaazatriphenylenehexacarbo-nitrile (HATCN), prepared via solvent evaporation, yielding 1:1 molar ratios, and horizontal vapor deposition, resulting in solvent-free 3:2 cocrystals. Combining spectroscopy and density-functional theory (DFT) calculations, we find that, while the electronic and optical properties of the cocrystals are largely unaffected by solvent inclusion, the charge transfer mechanism is surprisingly complex. Raman spectroscopy reveals a consistent charge transfer of 0.11 $e$ across all considered structures, corroborated by DFT calculations on solvent-free systems. Partial charge analysis reveals that in solvated cocrystals, solvent molecules actively participate in the charge transfer process as primary electron acceptors. This involvement can perturb the expected D:A behavior, revealing a faceted charge-transfer mechanism in HATCN even beyond the established involvement of its cyano group. Overall, our study demonstrates that while solution-based methods preserve the intrinsic D:A characteristics, solvents can be leveraged as active electronic components, opening new avenues for material design.

Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Optics (physics.optics)
Hydrogen-like alkali atoms with a single valence electron are the most common objects in quantum optics and, at the same time, serve as essential tools of the field. Under conditions of optical pumping, strong spin-exchange and ultra-weak magnetic field (spin-exchange relaxation free mode, SERF), ensembles of such atoms in the gas phase can demonstrate not only the absence of spin-exchange relaxation, but also nonlinear collective effects. We present experimental evidence that the alignment, i.e. the quadrupole momentum, can not only be preserved under SERF conditions, but also coexist and interact with the orientation, i.e. the dipole momentum. We also show that this interaction leads to bistability: a small change in conditions can cause the medium to transition to a different steady state, an effect characterized by hysteresis. The combination of properties of this effect opens up a wide range of applications as optical keys or memory elements with a storage time of hundreds of seconds in tasks of quantum information and cryptography.

Over the past decade, autophoretic colloids have emerged as a prototypical system for studying self-propelled motion at microscopic scales, with promising applications in microfluidics, micro-machinery, and therapeutics. Their motion in a viscous fluid hinges on their ability to induce surface slip flows that are spatially asymmetric, from self-generated solute gradients. Here, we demonstrate theoretically that a straight elastic filament with homogeneous surface chemical properties -- which is otherwise immotile -- can spontaneously achieve self-propulsion by experiencing a buckling instability that serves as the symmetry-breaking mechanism. Using efficient numerical simulations, we characterize the nonlinear dynamics of the elastic filament and show that, over time, it attains distinct swimming modes such as a steadily translating "U" shape and a metastable rotating "S" shape when semi-flexible, and an oscillatory state when highly flexible. Our findings provide physical insight into future experiments and the design of reconfigurable synthetic active colloids.

Carbon-based materials have attracted great attention due to their exceptional structural diversity and wide-ranging applications. Recently, a new two-dimensional carbon allotrope, named pentagraphene (PG), was proposed. In this study, we proposed three novel three-dimensional (3D) PG allotropes, named 3D-PG-$\alpha$, -$\beta$, and -$\gamma$, engineered through biaxial strain and controlled compression of 2D PG layers. Comprehensive stability analyses, including phonon dispersion and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations (AIMD), confirm their thermodynamic stability under room and high-temperature conditions. 3D-PG-$\alpha$ is the most stable, exhibiting a cohesive energy 0.5 eV/atom lower than the least stable structure, 3D-PG-$\gamma$. Electronic property characterization reveals semiconducting behavior for all structures, with indirect electronic band gaps ranging from 0.91 to 2.67 eV. The analyses of the mechanical properties showed significant anisotropy, with higher stiffness along the in-plane ($xy$-plane) direction. Optical properties highlight strong absorption along a wide range and a pronounced anisotropic response. Additionally, the absorption spectra exhibit activity in the visible region, and the refractive index and reflectivity indicate potential use in ultraviolet-blocking devices.

Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have attracted considerable attention due to their tunable structural, electronic, and spin-related properties, particularly in the presence of point defects and molecular adsorbates. Motivated by these aspects, we have investigated using first-principles methods the magnetic properties induced by azanide (NH$_2$) and ammonia (NH$_3$) adsorption on defective monolayers of Molybdenum Disulfide (MoS$_2$) and Diselenide(MoSe$_2$). Spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) was employed to investigate the impact of mono- and di-vacancies on the local spin environment and the role of molecular adsorption in modifying magnetic behavior. The results show that pristine chalcogen vacancies do not generate magnetism, whereas the adsorption of NH$_2$ and NH$_3$ creates localized magnetic moments in Mo-based dichalcogenides. A notable case occurs for MoSe$_2$, where NH$_3$ dissociation into NH$_2$ and H fragments on the same side of the surface produces a net magnetic moment of 2.0 $\mu_B$. Tests performed on W-based dichalcogenides under equivalent conditions showed no magnetic response, and are reported here only for comparison. These findings demonstrate that molecular adsorption combined with defect engineering can be a practical approach to tune magnetism in 2D materials, with potential relevance for spintronic and sensing applications.

Competitive adsorption is a major challenge in understanding catalytic activity, selectivity and reaction mechanisms in confined environments such as zeolites. This study investigated competitive adsorption in MFI-type zeolites (ZSM-5) using solid-state NMR, focusing on the interplay between toluene and water. Quantitative 1H NMR spectroscopy identified three distinct populations of adsorbed toluene evolving with increasing toluene loading. The adsorption behavior was consistent across a series of samples with Si/Al ratio ranging from 11.5 to 140. Combining 1D and 2D NMR techniques with sample engineering (e.g. pore-blocking) enabled the assignment of the populations to toluene within the zeolite channels, at the pore mouths, and adsorbed on the external crystal surface. Crucially, introducing water to toluene-loaded zeolites caused a partial displacement of toluene from the internal channels, but significant removal from the pore mouths. This dis-placement occurred even in the highly hydrophobic zeolite (Si/Al = 140), where water still preferentially adsorbed to Brønsted acid sites and silanol species. The results highlight the critical impact that competitive adsorption from solvents, products, or impurities can have on the efficiency and selectivity of zeolite-mediated transformations.

Fatigue life prediction is essential in both the design and operational phases of any aircraft, and in this sense safety in the aerospace industry requires early detection of fatigue cracks to prevent in-flight failures. Robust and precise fatigue life predictors are thus essential to ensure safety. Traditional engineering methods, while reliable, are time consuming and involve complex workflows, including steps such as conducting several Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations, deriving the expected loading spectrum, and applying cycle counting techniques like peak-valley or rainflow counting. These steps often require collaboration between multiple teams and tools, added to the computational time and effort required to achieve fatigue life predictions. Machine learning (ML) offers a promising complement to traditional fatigue life estimation methods, enabling faster iterations and generalization, providing quick estimates that guide decisions alongside conventional simulations.
In this paper, we present a ML-based pipeline that aims to estimate the fatigue life of different aircraft wing locations given the flight parameters of the different missions that the aircraft will be operating throughout its operational life. We validate the pipeline in a realistic use case of fatigue life estimation, yielding accurate predictions alongside a thorough statistical validation and uncertainty quantification. Our pipeline constitutes a complement to traditional methodologies by reducing the amount of costly simulations and, thereby, lowering the required computational and human resources.

Micro- and nanomechanical resonators are emerging as promising platforms for quantum technologies, precision sensors and fundamental science experiments. To utilize these devices for force sensing or quantum optomechanics, they must be brought in close proximity with other systems for functionalization or efficient readout. Improved understanding of the loss mechanisms in nanomechanical resonators, specifically the advent of dissipation dilution, has led to the development of resonators with unprecedented coherence properties. The mechanical quality factors of this new class of ultracoherent micro- and nanomechanical oscillators can now exceed 1 billion at room temperature, setting their force sensitivities below 1 $\mathrm{aN}/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$, surpassing those of the state-of-the-art atomic force microscopes (AFMs). Given this new regime of sensitivity, an intriguing question is whether the proximity of other materials hinders mechanical coherence. Here we show: it does. We report a novel dissipation mechanism that occurs in ultracoherent nanomechanical oscillators caused by the presence of nearby dielectrics. By studying the parameter scaling of the effect, we show that the mechanism is more severe for low-frequency mechanical modes and that it is due to dielectric loss within the materials caused by the motion of a resonator which carries static charges. Our observations are consistent with the noncontact friction (NCF) observed in AFMs. Our findings provide insights into limitations on the integration of ultracoherent nanomechanical resonators and highlight the adverse effects of charged defects in these systems.

Astroclimes -- measuring the abundance of CO$_2$ and CH$_4$ in the Earth's atmosphere using astronomical observations

Monitoring the abundance of greenhouse gases (GHGs) such as carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) and methane (CH$_4$) is necessary to quantify their impact on global warming and climate change. Although a number of satellites and ground-based networks measure the total column volume mixing ratio (VMR) of these gases, they rely on sunlight, and column measurements at night are comparatively scarce. We present a new algorithm, Astroclimes, that hopes to complement and extend nighttime CO$_2$ and CH4 column measurements. Astroclimes can measure the abundance of GHGs on Earth by generating a model telluric transmission spectra and fitting it to the spectra of telluric standard stars in the near-infrared taken by ground-based telescopes. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis on an extensive dataset from the CARMENES spectrograph showed that Astroclimes was able to recover the long term trend known to be present in the molecular abundances of both CO$_2$ and CH$_4$, but not their seasonal cycles. Using the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) global greenhouse gas reanalysis model (EGG4) as a benchmark, we identified an overall vertical shift in our data and quantified the long term scatter in our retrievals. The scatter on a 1 hour timescale, however, is much lower, and is on par with the uncertainties on individual measurements. Although currently the precision of the method is not in line with state of the art techniques using dedicated instrumentation, it shows promise for further development.

We obtain and investigate theoretically a broad family of stable and unstable time-periodic orbits-oscillating Turing rolls (OTR)-in the Lugiato-Lefever model of optical cavities. Using the dynamical systems tools developed in fluid dynamics, we access the OTR solution branches in parameter space and elucidate their bifurcation structure. By tracking these exact invariant solutions deeply into the chaotic region of the modulation instability, we connect the main dynamical regimes of the Lugiato-Lefever model: continuous waves, Turing rolls, solitons, and breathers, which completes the classical phase diagram of the optical cavity. We then demonstrate that the OTR periodic orbits play a fundamental role as elementary building blocks in the regime of the intracavity field transition from stable Turing rolls to fully developed turbulent regimes. Depending on the cavity size, we observe that the chaotic intracavity field driven by modulation instability displays either spatiotemporal or purely temporal intermittancy between chaotic dynamics and different families of the OTR solutions, exhibiting locally the distinctive wave patterns and large amplitude peaks. This opens avenues for a theoretical description of optical turbulence within the dynamical systems framework.

Because they are likely to accrete substantial amounts of interstellar gas, merging supermassive binary black holes are expected to be strong multimessenger sources, radiating gravitational waves, photons from thermal gas, and photons from relativistic electrons energized by relativistic jets. Here we report on a numerical simulation that covers the late inspiral, merger, and initial postmerger phase of such a system where both black holes have the same mass and spin, and both spin axes are parallel to the orbital angular momentum. The simulation incorporates both 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics and numerical relativity. The thermal photon power during the late inspiral, merger, and immediate postmerger phases is drawn from strong shocks rather than dissipation of turbulence inside a smoothly structured accretion disk as typically found around accreting single black holes. We find that the thermal photon and jet Poynting flux outputs are closely related in time, and we posit a mechanism that enforces this relation. The power radiated in both photons and jets diminishes gradually as merger is approached, but jumps sharply at merger to a noisy plateau. Such a distinct lightcurve should aid efforts to identify supermassive black hole mergers, with or without accompanying gravitational wave detections.

Neural mass models describe the mean-field dynamics of populations of neurons. In this work we illustrate how fundamental ideas of physics, such as energy and conserved quantities, can be explored for such models. We show that time-rescaling renders recent next-generation neural mass models Hamiltonian in the limit of a homogeneous population or strong coupling. The corresponding energy-like quantity provides considerable insight into the model dynamics even in the case of heterogeneity, and explain for example why orbits are near-ellipsoidal and predict spike amplitude during bursting dynamics. We illustrate how these energy considerations provide a possible link between neuronal population behavior and energy landscape theory, which has been used to analyze data from brain recordings. Our introduction of near-Hamiltonian descriptions of neuronal activity could permit the application of highly developed physics theory to get insight into brain behavior.

Squeezed-light generation in photonic integrated circuits (PICs) is essential for scalable continuous-variable (CV) quantum information processing. By suppressing quantum fluctuations below the shot-noise limit, squeezed states enable quantum-enhanced sensing and serve as a standard resource for CV quantum information processing. While chip-level squeezed-light sources have been demonstrated, extending this capability to the wafer level with reproducible strong squeezing to bolster large-scale quantum-enhanced sensing and information processing has been hindered by squeezed light's extreme susceptibility to device imperfections. Here, we report wafer-scale fabrication, generation, and characterization of two-mode squeezed-vacuum states on a fully complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)-compatible silicon nitride (Si$_3$N$_4$) PIC platform. Across a 4-inch wafer, 8 dies yield 2.9-3.1 dB directly measured quadrature squeezing with $< 0.2$ dB variation, demonstrating excellent uniformity. This performance is enabled by co-integrating ultralow-loss, strongly overcoupled high-$Q$ microresonators, cascaded pump-rejection filters, and low-loss inverse-tapered edge couplers. The measurements agree with a first-principles theoretical model parameterized solely by independently extracted device parameters and experimental settings. The measured squeezing level can be further improved by enhancing the efficiencies of off-chip detection and chip-to-fiber coupling. These results establish a reproducible, wafer-scale route to nonclassical-light generation in integrated photonics and lay the groundwork for scalable CV processors, multiplexed entanglement sources, and quantum-enhanced sensing.

Title:
Snakes combine vertical and lateral bending to traverse uneven terrain

Terrestrial locomotion requires generating appropriate ground reaction forces which depend on substrate geometry and physical properties. The richness of positions and orientations of terrain features in the 3-D world gives limbless animals like snakes that can bend their body versatility to generate forces from different contact areas for propulsion. Despite many previous studies of how snakes use lateral body bending for propulsion on relatively flat surfaces with lateral contact points, little is known about whether and how much snakes use vertical body bending in combination with lateral bending in 3-D terrain. This lack had contributed to snake robots being inferior to animals in stability, efficiency, and versatility when traversing complex 3-D environments. Here, to begin to elucidate this, we studied how the generalist corn snake traversed an uneven arena of blocks of random height variation 5 times its body height. The animal traversed the uneven terrain with perfect stability by propagating 3-D bending down its body with little transverse motion (11° slip angle). Although the animal preferred moving through valleys with higher neighboring blocks, it did not prefer lateral bending. Among body-terrain contact regions that potentially provide propulsion, 52% were formed by vertical body bending and 48% by lateral bending. The combination of vertical and lateral bending may dramatically expand the sources of propulsive forces available to limbless locomotors by utilizing various asperities available in 3-D terrain. Direct measurements of contact forces are necessary to further understand how snakes coordinate 3-D bending along the entire body via sensory feedback to propel through 3-D terrain. These studies will open a path to new propulsive mechanisms for snake robots, potentially increasing the performance and versatility in 3-D terrain.

Large-scale semi-discrete optimal transport with distributed Voronoi diagrams

Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph)
In this article, we propose a numerical method to solve semi-discrete optimal transport problems for gigantic pointsets (108 points and more). By pushing the limits by several orders of magnitude, it opens the path to new applications in cosmology, fluid simulation and data science to name but a few. The method is based on a new algorithm that computes (generalized) Voronoi diagrams in parallel and in a distributed way. First we make the simple observation that the cells defined by a subgraph of the Delaunay graph contain the Voronoi cells, and that one can deduce the missing edges from the intersections between those cells. Based on this observation, we introduce the Distributed Voronoi Diagram algorithm (DVD) that can be used on a cluster and that exchanges vertices between the nodes as need be. We also report early experimental results, demonstrating that the DVD algorithm has the potential to solve some giga-scale semi-discrete optimal transport problems encountered in computational cosmology.

Global seismic tomography, taking advantage of seismic waves from natural earthquakes, provides essential insights into the earth's internal dynamics. Advanced Full-waveform Inversion (FWI) techniques, whose aim is to meticulously interpret every detail in seismograms, confront formidable computational demands in forward modeling and adjoint simulations on a global scale. Recent advancements in Machine Learning (ML) offer a transformative potential for accelerating the computational efficiency of FWI and extending its applicability to larger scales. This work presents the first 3D global synthetic dataset tailored for seismic wavefield modeling and full-waveform tomography, referred to as the GlobalTomo dataset. This dataset is uniquely comprehensive, incorporating explicit wave physics and robust geophysical parameterization at realistic global scales, generated through state-of-the-art forward simulations optimized for 3D global wavefield calculations. Through extensive analysis and the establishment of ML baselines, we illustrate that ML approaches are particularly suitable for global FWI, overcoming its limitations with rapid forward modeling and flexible inversion strategies. This work represents a cross-disciplinary effort to enhance our understanding of the earth's interior through physics-ML modeling.

Medical Physics (physics.med-ph)
Cell tracking is a subject of active research gathering great interest in medicine and biology. Positron emission tomography (PET) is well suited for tracking radio-labeled cells in vivo due to its exceptional sensitivity and whole-body capability. For validation, ground-truth data are desirable that realistically mimic the flow of cells in a clinical situation. This study develops a workflow (CeFloPS) for simulating moving radio-labeled cells in a human phantom. From the XCAT phantom, the blood vessels are reduced to nodal networks along which cells can move and distribute to organs and tissues. The movement is directed by the blood flow, which is calculated in each node using the Hagen-Pooiseuille equation and Kirchhoff's laws assuming laminar flow. Organs are voxelized and movement of cells from artery entry to vein exit is generated via a biased 3D random walk. The probabilities of cells moving or remaining in tissues are derived from rate constants of tracer kinetic-based compartment modeling. PET listmode data is generated using the Monte-Carlo simulation framework GATE based on the definition of a large-body PET scanner with cell paths as moving radioactive sources and the XCAT phantom providing attenuation data. From the flow simulation of 100,000 cells, 100 sample cells were further processed by GATE and listmode data was reconstructed into images for comparison. As demonstrated by comparisons of simulated and reconstructed cell distributions, CeFloPS is capable of simulating cell behavior in whole-body PET. It achieves this simulation in a way that is anatomically and physiologically reasonable, thereby providing valuable data for the development and validation of cell tracking algorithms.

Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph)
This paper develops a general force-based pedestrian model named CosForce, in which cosine functions are employed to describe asymmetric interactions. These functions implicitly capture the mechanisms of anticipation and reaction. By focusing on binary interactions, the CosForce model provides new insights into pedestrian modeling while achieving property of linear time complexity. Two specific scenarios in crowd dynamics were analyzed: self-organization (entropy decrease) and crowd collapse (entropy increase). The average normalized speed and order parameter were introduced to quantitatively describe the processes of crowd dynamics. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that phase separation in crowds is effectively reproduced by the model, including lane formation, stripe formation, and cross-channel formation. Next, in the simulation of mass gathering, within a density-accumulating scenario, processes of critical transition in high-density crowds are clearly revealed through time series observations of the order parameter. These findings provide valuable insights into crowd dynamics.

First-Passage Time Fluctuation Theorem and Thermodynamic Bound in Cooperative Biomolecular Networks

A fluctuation theorem is examined for the first-passage time of a biomolecular machine (e.g., a motor protein or an enzyme) in a nonequilibrium steady-state. For such machines in which the driven, observable process is coupled to a hidden process in a kinetically cooperative fashion, the entropy produced along first-passage trajectories is no longer constant, resulting in a breakdown of this expression. Here, we consider the canonical model for this type of system, a kinetic scheme for conformation-modulated single-enzyme catalysis (a type of continuous-time Markov process with relevance to $\beta$-galactosidase and human glucokinase), as we explore this fluctuation theorem in cooperative biomolecular networks. Kinetic evaluations are performed using a novel, efficient pathway analysis technique, allowing us to attain surprising and concise results from complex calculations. We find that in the absence of hidden current, a fluctuation theorem can be established for the first-passage time of the observable process, and we demonstrate that this dramatic reduction is a general feature applicable to a wide variety of cooperative networks. The validity of this expression can be experimentally tested, with its violation serving as a unique signature of hidden detailed balance breaking. In addition, we obtain a remarkably compact exact expression for the integrated correction to this first-passage time fluctuation theorem, as well as the general form, revealing a thermodynamic bound on the kinetic branching ratio (a measure of directionality defined as the ratio of the forward observable process probability to the backward one). These results provide detailed insight into the rich connections between dynamic measurements and the underlying nonequilibrium thermodynamics for cooperative biomolecular machines.

Droplet formation has emerged as an essential concept for the spatiotemporal organisation of biomolecules in cells. However, classical descriptions of droplet dynamics based on passive liquid-liquid phase separation cannot capture the complex situations inside cells. This review discusses three general aspects that are crucial in cells: (i) biomolecules are diverse and individually complex, implying that cellular droplets posses complex internal behaviour, e.g., in terms of their material properties; (ii) the cellular environment contains many solid-like structures that droplets can wet; (iii) cells are alive and use fuel to drive processes out of equilibrium. We illustrate how these principles control droplet nucleation, growth, position, and count to unveil possible regulatory mechanisms in biological cells and other applications of phase separation.

Underexpanded jets are present in various engineering applications; in recent years, they have gained special attention because of the development of gas-fueled propulsion systems. In these apparatuses, the direct injection of fuels such as hydrogen in innovative low-emission engines' chambers induces turbulent under-expanded jets. In this study, we performed high-fidelity Large Eddy Simulations of under-expanded hydrogen jets to investigate mixing characteristics and provide valuable insights for developing injectors suitable for hydrogen and, more generally, gaseous-fueled propulsion systems. We initially assessed the method's accuracy, evaluating the convergence and uncertainty of the numerical results and validating them against experimental particle image velocimetry and Schlieren data. The simulated jets, the Mach disc dimensions, and the resulting velocity field align closely with the experimental observations. Then, we analysed the jet structure for pressure ratios of 4 to 25 and examined the effects of the geometrical configuration of the nozzle on the characteristics of the air-fuel mixture obtained. We compared the jets resulting from a round-hole nozzle with annular ones resembling outward-opening injectors.

Background: Deep learning (DL)-based organ segmentation is increasingly used in radiotherapy, yet voxel-wise DL uncertainty maps are rarely presented to clinicians. Purpose: This study assessed how DL-generated uncertainty maps impact radiation oncologists during manual correction of prostate radiotherapy DL segmentations. Methods: Two nnUNet models were trained by 10-fold cross-validation on 434 MRI-only prostate cancer cases to segment the prostate and rectum. Each model was evaluated on 35 independent cases. Voxel-wise uncertainty was calculated using the SoftMax standard deviation (n=10) and visualized as a color-coded map. Four oncologists performed segmentation in two steps: Step 1: Rated segmentation quality and confidence using Likert scales and edited DL segmentations without uncertainty maps. Step 2 ($\geq 4$ weeks later): Repeated step 1, but with uncertainty maps available. Segmentation time was recorded for both steps, and oncologists provided qualitative free-text feedback. Histogram analysis compared voxel edits across uncertainty levels. Results: DL segmentations showed high agreement with oncologist edits. Quality ratings varied: rectum segmentation ratings slightly decreased overall in step 2, while prostate ratings differed among oncologists. Confidence ratings also varied. Three oncologists reduced segmentation time with uncertainty maps, saving 1-2 minutes per case. Histogram analysis showed 50% fewer edits for step 2 in low-uncertainty areas. Conclusions: Presenting DL segmentation uncertainty information to radiation oncologists influences their decision-making, quality perception, and confidence in the DL segmentations. Low-uncertainty regions were edited less frequently, indicating increased trust in DL predictions. Uncertainty maps improve efficiency by reducing segmentation time and can be a valuable clinical tool, enhancing radiotherapy planning efficiency.

Hydrodynamic memory and Quincke rotation

Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
The spontaneous (so-called Quincke) rotation of an uncharged, solid, dielectric, spherical particle under a steady electric field is analyzed, accounting for the inertia of the particle and the transient fluid inertia, or ``hydrodynamic memory,'' due to the unsteady Stokes flow around the particle. The dynamics of the particle are encapsulated in three coupled nonlinear integro-differential equations for the evolution of the angular velocity of the particle, and the components of the induced dipole of the particle that are parallel and transverse to the applied field. These equations represent a generalization of the celebrated Lorenz system. A numerical solution of these `modified Lorenz equations' (MLE) shows that hydrodynamic memory leads to an increase in the threshold field strength for chaotic particle rotation, which is in qualitative agreement with experimental observations. Furthermore, hydrodynamic memory leads to an increase in the range of field strengths where multi-stability between steady and chaotic rotation occurs. At large field strengths, chaos ceases and the particle is predicted to execute periodic rotational motion.

Targeted Radionuclide Therapy (TRT) is a modern strategy in radiation oncology that aims to administer a potent radiation dose specifically to cancer cells using cancer-targeting radiopharmaceuticals. Accurate radiation dose estimation tailored to individual patients is crucial. Deep learning, particularly with pre-therapy imaging, holds promise for personalizing TRT doses. However, current methods require large time series of SPECT imaging, which is hardly achievable in routine clinical practice, and thus raises issues of data availability. Our objective is to develop a semi-supervised learning (SSL) solution to personalize dosimetry using pre-therapy images. The aim is to develop an approach that achieves accurate results when PET/CT images are available, but are associated with only a few post-therapy dosimetry data provided by SPECT images. In this work, we introduce an SSL method using a pseudo-label generation approach for regression tasks inspired by the FixMatch framework. The feasibility of the proposed solution was preliminarily evaluated through an in-silico study using synthetic data and Monte Carlo simulation. Experimental results for organ dose prediction yielded promising outcomes, showing that the use of pseudo-labeled data provides better accuracy compared to using only labeled data.

Using this strategy, it is possible to assess the validity of such models without specifying the distribution of the angular power spectrum estimators. This holds under general conditions, ensuring the method's applicability in diverse applications. Moreover, the proposed solution overcomes the need for case-by-case simulations when testing different models, leading to notable computational advantages.

Floating random walk-based capacitance extraction has emerged in recent years as a tried and true approach for extracting parasitic capacitance in very large scale integrated circuits. Being a Monte Carlo method, its performance is dependent on the variance of sampled quantities and variance reduction methods are crucial for the challenges posed by ever denser process technologies and layout-dependent effects. In this work, we present a novel, universal variance reduction method for floating random walk-based capacitance extraction, which is conceptually simple, highly efficient and provably reduces variance in all extractions, especially when layout-dependent effects are present. It is complementary to existing mathematical formulations for variance reduction and its performance gains are experienced on top of theirs. Numerical experiments demonstrate substantial such gains of up to 50% in number of walks necessary as well as in actual extraction times compared to the best previously proposed variance reduction approaches for the floating random-walk.

The dragon-king earthquake hypothesis proposes that some very large to great earthquakes are not merely the extreme end of the frequency-magnitude Gutenberg-Richter distribution (FMD), but are generated by distinct physical mechanisms, making them statistical outliers. We develop a data-driven framework to systematically test the dragon-king earthquake hypothesis. Our method combines objective spatial clustering, based on data-adaptive kernel density estimation (KDE), with a high-power sequential outlier detection technique. For each identified cluster, we exam sine the tail of the FMD to identify anomalous events. Candidate dragon-kings are evaluated via robust statistical tests, primarily the max-robust-sum (MRS) test with inward sequential testing. For each observed statistic of the MRS test, we calculate its p-value defined as the probability that this statistic could be generated by the null distribution. We apply this framework to seismicity surrounding the 1975 Haicheng mL 7.4 and 1976 Tangshan mL 7.9 earthquakes. For Haicheng, the mainshock shows a strong dragon-king signature in its pre-mainshock sequence, with p-values between 0.03 and 0.07 across a stable range of KDE density thresholds used to define natural seismicity clusters. Post-mainshock and combined sequences yield slightly higher p-values (up to 0.09). In contrast, the Tangshan mainshock exhibits a weaker outlier signal before the event (p-values in the range 0.05-0.15) but a stronger dragon-king signature afterward, with p-values from 0.015 to 0.05. The evidence that the Haicheng and Tangshan mainshocks exhibit dragon-king characteristics supports the idea that some large and great earthquakes arise from a maturation process that may enhance predictability. Haicheng provides a clear case study, while retrospective analyses suggest that Tangshan might also have been forecasted under more systematic procedures.

(Un)biased data and spin glasses reveal clustering for Turing phase transitions within human-transformer interactions

This paper studies a Large Language Model's ability to exhibit intelligence equivalent to that of a human by analyzing temperature-induced phase transitions, abrupt changes in the macroscopic behavior of a system, in the Turing test. We utilize three approaches: statistical analysis and bias quantification of a human evaluation survey, information retrieval from real human-written versus AI-generated text data using cosine similarity as a comparison metric, and mathematical spin glass model and simulation. We collect text data in the case study of Flitzing, a tradition of emailing poem-like romantic invitations at Dartmouth College because of its richness in information. Across the three approaches, we obtain consistency in phase transition and clustering results, which also align with literature on the mathematics of transformers and metastability. Our work inspires utilizing spin glass theory for the mathematical foundations of artificial intelligence, especially under environmental stochasticity from human interactions, with justification from real data.

Motivated by recent experimental advances, including the ongoing development of an optical atomic clock in singly ionised radium, we perform a detailed theoretical characterisation of Ra+ and its lighter analogue, Ba+. Both ions are of interest for precision studies, including for atomic parity violation and searches for new physics beyond the standard model. Using the all-orders correlation potential method, including Breit and radiative quantum electrodynamics corrections, we perform high-accuracy calculations of electric-dipole (E1), electric-quadrupole (E2), and magnetic-dipole (M1) transition matrix elements between the low-lying s, p, and d states of these ions, as well as the excited-state lifetimes, polarizabilities, magic wavelengths, and magnetic dipole (A) hyperfine structure constants. By combining lifetime measurements with precise theoretical ratios, we extract high-accuracy determinations of the s-d_1/2 and s-d_3/2 E2 matrix elements. By combining hyperfine measurements with atomic theory, we extract parameters of the nuclear magnetisation distribution (the Bohr-Weisskopf effect) for 135-, 137-Ba and 223-, 225-Ra. These results provide theoretical input for ongoing and future experimental programs in fundamental physics and precision metrology.

Characterisation of temporal aiming for water waves with an anisotropic metabathymetry

Subjects:
Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
The deflection of waves by combining the effects of time modulation with anisotropy has been recently proposed in the context of electromagnetism. In this work, we characterise this phenomenon, called temporal aiming, for water waves using a time-varying metabathymetry. This metabathymetry is composed of thin vertical plates that are periodically arranged at the fluid bottom and which act as an effective anisotropic medium for the surface wave in the long-wavelength approximation. When this plate array is vertically lifted at the fluid bottom at a given time, the medium switches from isotropic to anisotropic, causing a wavepacket to scatter in time and deflect from its initial trajectory. Following a simple modelling, we obtain the scattering coefficients of the two waves generated due to the sudden medium change as well as the angle of deviation with respect to the incident angle. We then numerically evaluate this scattering problem with simulations of the full 2D effective anisotropic wave equation, with a time-dependent anisotropy tensor. Finally, we provide experimental evidence of the temporal aiming, using space time resolved measurement techniques, demonstrating the trajectory shift of a wavepacket and measuring its angle of deviation.

We present "torchGDM", a numerical framework for nano-optical simulations based on the Green's Dyadic Method (GDM). This toolkit combines a hybrid approach, allowing for both fully discretized nano-structures and structures approximated by sets of effective electric and magnetic dipoles. It supports simulations in three dimensions and for infinitely long, two-dimensional structures. This capability is particularly suited for multi-scale modeling, enabling accurate near-field calculations within or around a discretized structure embedded in a complex environment of scatterers represented by effective models. Importantly, torchGDM is entirely implemented in PyTorch, a well-optimized and GPU-enabled automatic differentiation framework. This allows for the efficient calculation of exact derivatives of any simulated observable with respect to various inputs, including positions, wavelengths or permittivity, but also intermediate parameters like Green's tensor components, which can be interesting for physics informed deep learning applications. We anticipate that this toolkit will be valuable for applications merging nano-photonics and machine learning, as well as for solving nano-photonic optimization and inverse problems, such as the global design and characterization of metasurfaces, where optical interactions between structures are critical.

Synergistic Motifs in Gaussian Systems

High-order interdependencies are central features of complex systems, yet a mechanistic explanation for their emergence remains elusive. Currently, it is unknown under what conditions high-order interdependencies, quantified by the information-theoretic construct of synergy, arise in systems governed by pairwise interactions. We solve this problem by providing precise sufficient and necessary conditions for when synergy prevails over low-order interdependencies, namely, we prove that antibalanced (highly frustrated) correlational structures in Gaussian systems are sufficient for synergy-dominance and that antibalanced interaction motifs in Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes are necessary for synergy-dominance. We validate the applicability of these analytical insights in Ising, oscillatory, and empirical networks from multiple domains. Our results demonstrate that pairwise interactions can give rise to synergistic information in the absence of explicit high-order mechanisms, and highlight structural balance theory as an instrumental conceptual framework to study high-order interdependencies.

This study enhances the application of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for modeling discontinuous solutions in both hydrodynamics and relativistic hydrodynamics. Conventional PINNs, trained with partial differential equation residuals, frequently face convergence issues and lower accuracy near discontinuities. To address these issues, we build on the recently proposed locally linearized PINNs (LLPINNs), which improve shock detection by modifying the Jacobian matrix resulting from the linearization of the equations, only in regions where the velocity field exhibits strong compression. However, the original LLPINN framework required a priori knowledge of shock velocities, limiting its practical utility. We present a generalized LLPINN method that dynamically computes shock speeds using neighboring states and applies jump conditions through entropy constraints. Additionally, we introduce locally Roe PINNs (LRPINNs), which incorporate an approximate Roe Riemann solver to improve shock resolution and conservation properties across discontinuities. These methods are adapted to two-dimensional Riemann problems by using a divergence-based shock detection combined with dimensional splitting, delivering precise solutions. Compared to a high-order weighted essentially non-oscillatory solver, our method produces sharper shock transitions but smoother solutions in areas with small-scale vortex structures. Future research will aim to improve the resolution of these small-scale features without compromising the model's ability to accurately capture shocks.

We investigate the collective dynamics of multivortex assemblies in a two dimensional (2D) toroidal fluid film of distinct curvature and topology. The incompressible and inviscid nature of the fluid allows a Hamiltonian description of the vortices, along with a self-force of geometric origin, arising from the standard Kirchhoff-Routh regularization procedure. The Hamiltonian dynamics is constructed in terms of $q$-digamma functions $\Psi_q(z)$, closely related to the Schottky-Klein prime function known to arise in multiply connected domains. We show the fundamental motion of the two-vortex system and identify five classes of geodesics on the torus for the special case of a vortex dipole, along with subtle distinctions from vortices in quantum superfluids. In multivortex assemblies, we observe that a randomly initialized cluster of vortices of the same sign and strength (chiral cluster) remains geometrically confined on the torus, while undergoing an overall drift along the toroidal direction, exhibiting collective dynamics. A cluster of fast and slow vortices also show the collective toroidal drift, with the fast ones predominantly occupying the core region and the slow ones expelled to the periphery of the revolving cluster. Vortex clusters of mixed sign but zero net circulation (achiral cluster) show unconfined dynamics and scatter all over the surface of the torus. A chiral cluster with an impurity in the form of a single vortex of opposite sign also show similar behavior as a pure chiral cluster, with occasional ``jets" of dipoles leaving and re-entering the revolving cluster. The work serves as a step towards analysis of vortex clusters in models that incorporate harmonic velocities in the Hodge decomposition.

Active viscoelastic condensates provide controllable mechanical anchor points

Many biological materials must couple mechanical strength with the ability to rapidly self-assemble at a specific location. In particular, biomolecular condensates readily self-assemble via phase separation, but may also need to resist external forces to fulfil their function. Spatial localisation of condensate formation can be controlled by active cores that preferentially drive the production of condensate material at a particular point, while resistance to external forces can be facilitated by viscoelastic material properties. To investigate the interplay of these two processes, we develop a continuum model of viscoelastic growth around an active core. We find that viscoelastic stresses restrict condensate growth, but also impart resistance to deformation. We investigate the effect of different incorporation schemes on growth dynamics, and test the influence of mechanical properties on condensate strength. Finally, we compare the predictions of our model to experimental data from centrosomes in C. elegans embryos, identifying a parameter regime in which rapid growth can be combined with appropriate mechanical strength, and studying how strain-dependent material incorporation may lead to isotropic growth of scaffold material. Our results provide general design principles for other materials that must reconcile rapid, localised self-assembly with mechanical strength, such as focal adhesions.

LPCVD based Plasma Damage Free in situ etching of $β$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ using Solid Source Gallium

Subjects:
Applied Physics (physics.app-ph)
This work demonstrates a novel in situ etching technique for $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ using solid-source metallic Ga in a LPCVD system, enabling clean, anisotropic, plasma damage-free etching. Etching behavior was systematically studied on (-201) $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ films and patterned (010) $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ substrates as a function of temperature, Ar carrier gas flow, and Ga source-to-substrate distance. The process exhibits vapor transport- and surface-reaction-limited behavior, with etch rates reaching a maximum of $\sim$2.25~$\mu$m/hr on (010) substrates at 1050~$^\circ$C and 2 cm spacing. Etch rates decrease sharply with increasing source-to-substrate distance due to reduced Ga vapor availability, while elevated temperatures enhance surface reaction kinetics through increased Ga reactivity and suboxide formation, leading to enhanced etch rates. In-plane anisotropy studies using radial trench patterns reveal that the (100) orientation produces the most stable etch front, characterized by smooth, vertical sidewalls and minimal lateral etching, consistent with its lowest surface free energy. In contrast, orientations such as (101), which possess higher surface energy, exhibit pronounced lateral etching and micro-faceting. As the trench orientation progressively deviates from (100), lateral etching increases. Facet evolution is observed between (100) and (-102), where stepped sidewalls composed of alternating (100) and (-102) segments progressively transition into a single inclined facet, which stabilizes along (100) or (-102) depending on the trench orientation. The (100)-aligned fins exhibit minimal bottom curvature, while (201)-aligned structures display increased under-etching and trench rounding.

Understanding Earth's subsurface is critical for energy transition, natural hazard mitigation, and planetary science. Yet subsurface analysis remains fragmented, with separate models required for structural interpretation, stratigraphic analysis, geobody segmentation, and property modeling-each tightly coupled to specific data distributions and task formulations. We introduce the Geological Everything Model 3D (GEM), a unified generative architecture that reformulates all these tasks as prompt-conditioned inference along latent structural frameworks derived from subsurface imaging. This formulation moves beyond task-specific models by enabling a shared inference mechanism, where GEM propagates human-provided prompts-such as well logs, masks, or structural sketches-along inferred structural frameworks to produce geologically coherent outputs. Through this mechanism, GEM achieves zero-shot generalization across tasks with heterogeneous prompt types, without retraining for new tasks or data sources. This capability emerges from a two-stage training process that combines self-supervised representation learning on large-scale field seismic data with adversarial fine-tuning using mixed prompts and labels across diverse subsurface tasks. GEM demonstrates broad applicability across surveys and tasks, including Martian radar stratigraphy analysis, structural interpretation in subduction zones, full seismic stratigraphic interpretation, geobody segmentation, and property modeling. By bridging expert knowledge with generative reasoning in a structurally aware manner, GEM lays the foundation for scalable, human-in-the-loop geophysical AI-transitioning from fragmented pipelines to a vertically integrated, promptable reasoning system.

Timely up- or down-regulation of gene expression is crucial for cellular differentiation and function. While gene upregulation via transcriptional activators has been extensively investigated, gene silencing remains understudied, especially by modelling. This study employs 3D simulations to study the biophysics of a chromatin fibre where active transcription factors compete with repressors for binding to transcription units along the fibre, and investigates how different silencing mechanisms affect 3D chromatin structure and transcription. We examine three gene silencing feedback mechanisms: positive, negative, and neutral. These mechanisms capture different silencing pathways observed or proposed in biological systems. Our findings reveal that, whilst all mechanisms lead to a silencing transition, the signatures of this transition depend on the choice of the feedback. The latter controls the morphologies of the emergent 3D transcription factor clusters, the average gene expression and its variability, or gene noise, and the network of ensuing correlations between activities of neighbouring transcription units. These results provide insights into the biophysics of gene silencing, as well as into the interplay between transcriptional regulation and 3D genome organisation.

The ALICE Collaboration is planning to construct a new detector (ALICE 3) aiming at exploiting the potential of the high-luminosity Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The new detector will allow ALICE to participate in LHC Run 5 scheduled from 2036 to 2041. The muon-identifier subsystem (MID) is part of the ALICE 3 reference detector layout. The MID will consist of a standard magnetic iron absorber ($\approx4$ nuclear interaction lengths) followed by muon chambers. The baseline option for the MID chambers considers plastic scintillation bars equipped with wave-length shifting fibers and readout with silicon photomultipliers. This paper reports on the performance of a MID chamber prototype using 3 GeV/$c$ pion- and muon-enriched beams delivered by the CERN Proton Synchrotron (PS). The prototype was built using extruded plastic scintillator produced by FNAL-NICADD (Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory - Northern Illinois Center for Accelerator and Detector Development). The prototype was experimentally evaluated using varying absorber thicknesses (60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 cm) to assess its performance. The analysis was performed using Machine Learning techniques and the performance was validated with GEANT 4 simulations. Potential improvements in both hardware and data analysis are discussed.

In the tunneling regime and at sufficiently low field amplitudes, the shape of orientation-dependent molecular ionization rate curves usually resembles the shape of the ionized orbital. As the ionizing field strength increases, the shape of the ionization rate can deviate from this pattern. The oft-cited explanation is that the increasing contribution of excited states relative to the ground state modifies the distribution. In this paper, we show that orbital distortion and parabolic channel effects, which are independent of excited-state effects, can also significantly modify the angular dependence of the yields of widely studied molecules where excited state effects are negligible. For example, we find that in CH$_3$Br, the interplay between orbital distortion and parabolic channel effects transforms a local minimum in the orientation-dependent ionization rate to a local maximum as the ionizing field strength increases. To simulate orbital distortion and parabolic channel effects, we use the one-electron weak-field asymptotic theory including the first-order correction (OE-WFAT(1)) in the integral representation. Since OE-WFAT(1) incurs expensive computations when the number of orientation angles is large, we also reformulate the original OE-WFAT(1) algorithm into a partial-wave expansion form, which greatly enhances the efficiency of the method.

We report a mid-infrared ring laser via fiber-to-waveguide hybrid integration enabled by directional couplers fabricated in fluoride glasses. Directional couplers were inscribed into fluoride glass using femtosecond laser direct writing, forming low-loss waveguides with a high positive refractive index change. The waveguides were optimized for efficient guidance at a wavelength of 2.7 {\textmu}m. Directional couplers with systematically varied coupling gap and interaction lengths were fabricated and experimentally characterized, demonstrating controllable power splitting ratios spanning from complete transmission (100:0) to balanced coupling (50:50). A directional coupler with a 7 {\textmu}m coupling gap and a 1.5 mm interaction length, providing an 80:20 power splitting ratio, was integrated with a cladding-pumped Er:ZBLAN fiber to realize a ring laser cavity. The resulting device produced stable lasing at 2716.7 nm with an output power of 14.2 mW. This work represents the first realization of a fully fiber-chip integrated mid-infrared laser source and opens new avenues for 3D photonic integration in fluoride glasses, enabling design flexibility previously unattainable in traditional fiber-optics architectures.

Optical metasurfaces supporting resonances with high quality factors offer an outstanding platform for applications such as non-linear optics, light guiding, lasing, sensing, light-matter coupling, and quantum optics. However, their experimental realization typically demands elaborate multi-step procedures such as metal or dielectric deposition, lift-off, and reactive ion etching. As a consequence, accessibility, large-scale production and sustainability are constrained by reliance on cost-, time- and labor-intensive facilities. We overcome this fabrication hurdle by repurposing polymethyl methacrylate-which is usually employed as a temporary resist-as the resonator material, thereby eliminating all steps except for spin-coating, exposure and development. Because the low refractive index of the polymer limits effective mode formation, we present a bilayer recipe that enables the convenient fabrication of a freestanding membrane to maximize the index contrast with its surroundings. Since etching induced defects are circumvented, the membrane features high quality nanopatterns. We further examine the suspended membrane with scanning electron microscopy and extract its position-dependent spring constant and pretension with nanoindentation experiments applied by the tip of an atomic force microscope. Our all-polymer metasurface hosting Bound States in the Continuum experimentally delivers high quality factors (up to 523) at visible and near infrared wavelengths, despite the low refractive index of the polymer, and enables straightforward geometry-based tuning of both linewidth and resonance position. We envision this methodology to lay the groundwork for accessible, high performance metasurfaces with unique use cases such as material blending, angled writing and mechanically based resonance tuning.

We report in this experimental and numerical study effects of gelation on the early-time spreading ($<$ 10ms) of millimetric non-Newtonian drops of biopolymer and particle suspensions impacting a Newtonian liquid containing reactive compounds. Our analyses are initially conducted through experiments by considering a variety of biopolymer and gelling compound concentrations, and impact velocities. The experimental results are then compared to three-dimensional numerical simulations based on a variational multiscale approach, which focuses on the impact of simple viscoplastic drops on a liquid bath in the absence of gelation (non-reactive liquid). These comparisons enable the development of theoretical arguments that emphasise relevant gelation effects on the drop's maximum spreading.

Data-driven acceleration of scientific computing workflows has been a high-profile aim of machine learning (ML) for science, with numerical simulation of transient partial differential equations (PDEs) being one of the main applications. The focus thus far has been on methods that require classical simulations to train, which when combined with the data-hungriness and optimization challenges of neural networks has caused difficulties in demonstrating a convincing advantage against strong classical baselines. We consider an alternative paradigm in which the learner uses a classical solver's own data to accelerate it, enabling a one-shot speedup of the simulation. Concretely, since transient PDEs often require solving a sequence of related linear systems, the feedback from repeated calls to a linear solver such as preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) can be used by a bandit algorithm to online-learn an adaptive sequence of solver configurations (e.g. preconditioners). The method we develop, PCGBandit, is implemented directly on top of the popular open source software OpenFOAM, which we use to show its effectiveness on a set of fluid and magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) problems.

With the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) the number of collisions per bunch crossing increases. To cope with these high rates in the pixel trackers, per-pixel time measurements are required, which implies the need for fast sensors. The inverse Low-Gain Avalanche Detector (iLGAD) is one of the fast sensor options that is being investigated. This paper will show the results of an inverse Low-Gain Avalanche Detector (iLGAD) with a pitch of 55 $\mu$m, a thickness of 250~$\mu$m and a large-area (2~cm$^2$), bump bonded to a Timepix4 ASIC. Timepix4 has 195~ps time binning on each pixel and therefore an excellent ASIC to test the sensor. The sensor is characterised with radio-active source measurements in the lab, and during beam test at the CERN SPS North Area H8 beamline, where the Timepix4 telescope was used. The telescope has a time reference of 12~ps and a pointing resolution of 2.4 $\pm$ 0.1~$\mu$m. The iLGAD shows an almost uniform gain of approximately 4 and an efficiency of 99.6 $\pm$ 0.1\%. Without any corrections the obtained time resolution is about 750~ps. After timewalk and clock corrections the time resolution becomes 377 $\pm$ 7~ps. Grazing angle measurements have been done, which allow to measure the time resolution as function of depth of the charge deposition in the sensor. This provides more insight for the perpendicular time resolution.

Many applications require robots to move through complex 3-D terrain with large obstacles, such as self-driving, search and rescue, and extraterrestrial exploration. Although robots are already excellent at avoiding sparse obstacles, they still struggle in traversing cluttered large obstacles. To make progress, we need to better understand how to use and control the physical interaction with obstacles to traverse them. Forest floor-dwelling cockroaches can use physical interaction to transition between different locomotor modes to traverse flexible, grass-like beams of a large range of stiffness. Inspired by this, here we studied whether and how environmental force sensing helps robots make active adjustments to traverse cluttered large obstacles. We developed a physics model and a simulation of a minimalistic robot capable of sensing environmental forces during traversal of beam obstacles. Then, we developed a force-feedback control strategy, which estimated beam stiffness from the sensed contact force using the physics model. Then in simulation we used the estimated stiffness to control the robot to either stay in or transition to the more favorable locomotor modes to traverse. When beams were stiff, force sensing induced the robot to transition from a more costly pitch mode to a less costly roll mode, which helped the robot traverse with a higher success rate and less energy consumed. By contrast, if the robot simply pushed forward or always avoided obstacles, it would consume more energy, become stuck in front of beams, or even flip over. When the beams were flimsy, force sensing guided the robot to simply push across the beams. In addition, we demonstrated the robustness of beam stiffness estimation against body oscillations, randomness in oscillation, and uncertainty in position sensing. We also found that a shorter sensorimotor delay reduced energy cost of traversal.

We introduce CrystalFormer, a transformer-based autoregressive model specifically designed for space group-controlled generation of crystalline materials. By explicitly incorporating space group symmetry, CrystalFormer greatly reduces the effective complexity of crystal space, which is essential for data-and compute-efficient generative modeling of crystalline materials. Leveraging the prominent discrete and sequential nature of the Wyckoff positions, CrystalFormer learns to generate crystals by directly predicting the species and coordinates of symmetry-inequivalent atoms in the unit cell. We demonstrate the advantages of CrystalFormer in standard tasks such as symmetric structure initialization and element substitution over widely used conventional approaches. Furthermore, we showcase its plug-and-play application to property-guided materials design, highlighting its flexibility. Our analysis reveals that CrystalFormer ingests sensible solid-state chemistry knowledge and heuristics by compressing the material dataset, thus enabling systematic exploration of crystalline materials space. The simplicity, generality, and adaptability of CrystalFormer position it as a promising architecture to be the foundational model of the entire crystalline materials space, heralding a new era in materials discovery and design.

Within the liquid drop model built up with the nuclear interaction parametrization Sk$\chi$450, which is based on the chiral effective field theory, we calculate numerically the internal energy density for each of nuclear pasta phases and for the uniform nuclear matter. We provide quantitative arguments in favor of coexistence of various nuclear matter phases at a significant range of total pressure within the inner crust of neutron stars, a concept known as crystal polymorphism. Specifically, we find that differences of the internal energy per baryon for various phases are typically less than the thermal energy per a freedom degree at temperature about $10^8$--$10^9$ K, which sets the energetic scale for thermal fluctuations of state of Fermi liquid from the ground state. The nuclear energy contributions are described using the same parametrization Sk$\chi$450 for the bulk, plain surface and curvature terms. We find that the introduction of the curvature correction changes the ground state in a relevant way. This may be understood as a consequence of the corresponding change in size of the nucleus, which significantly modifies the phase transition densities. Using the calculated structural parameters from liquid drop model, we explore the physical consequences of the expected Cooper pairing of protons in lasagna phase. In this case, we find a crossover between the discreet layered and the three-dimensional anisotropic regimes of superconductivity. Additionally, we study the magnetic stress in lasagna accounting for a rotational lag between superfluid neutrons and the crystal lattice, which is believed to develop naturally in pulsars and magnetars. Our results offer a preliminary insight into rich magnetic properties of the inner crust of neutron stars.

The half-life of $^{39}$Ar is measured using the DEAP-3600 detector located 2 km underground at SNOLAB. Between 2016 and 2020, DEAP-3600 used a target mass of (3269 $\pm$ 24) kg of liquid argon distilled from the atmosphere in a direct-detection dark matter search. Such an argon mass also enables direct measurements of argon isotope properties. The decay of $^{39}$Ar in DEAP-3600 is the dominant source of triggers by two orders of magnitude, ensuring high statistics and making DEAP-3600 well-suited for measuring this isotope's half-life. Use of the pulse-shape discrimination technique in DEAP-3600 allows powerful discrimination between nuclear recoils and electron recoils, resulting in the selection of a clean sample of $^{39}$Ar decays. Observing over a period of 3.4 years, the $^{39}$Ar half-life is measured to be $(302 \pm 8_{\rm stat} \pm 6_{\rm sys})$ years. This new direct measurement suggests that the half-life of $^{39}$Ar is significantly longer than the accepted value, with potential implications for measurements using this isotope's half-life as input.

Fractional Brownian motion with mean-density interaction: a myopic self-avoiding fractional stochastic process

Fractional Brownian motion is a Gaussian stochastic process with long-range correlations in time; it has been shown to be a useful model of anomalous diffusion. Here, we investigate the effects of mutual interactions in an ensemble of particles undergoing fractional Brownian motion. Specifically, we introduce a mean-density interaction in which each particle in the ensemble is coupled to the gradient of the total, time-integrated density produced by the entire ensemble. We report the results of extensive computer simulations for the mean-squared displacements and the probability densities of particles undergoing one-dimensional fractional Brownian motion with such a mean-density interaction. We find two qualitatively different regimes, depending on the anomalous diffusion exponent $\alpha$ characterizing the fractional Gaussian noise. The motion is governed by the interactions for $\alpha < 4/3$ whereas it is dominated by the fractional Gaussian noise for $\alpha > 4/3$. We develop a scaling theory explaining our findings. We also discuss generalizations to higher space dimensions and nonlinear interactions, the relation of our process to the ``true'' or myopic self-avoiding walk, as well as applications to the growth of strongly stochastic axons (e.g., serotonergic fibers) in vertebrate brains.

Dielectric permittivity of water confined in stacks of charged lipid layers: extracting profiles from molecular dynamics simulations using a modified Poisson-Boltzmann equation

Most organic and inorganic surfaces (e.g., glass, nucleic acids or lipid membranes) become charged in aqueous solutions. The resulting ionic distribution induces effective interactions between the charged surfaces. Stacks of like-charged lipid bilayers immersed in multivalent ion solutions exhibit strong coupling (SC) effects, where ion correlations cause counter-intuitive membrane attraction. A similar attraction observed with monovalent ions is explained by SC theory through reduced dielectric permittivity under confinement. To explore this phenomenon, we propose a modified Poisson-Boltzmann (mPB) model with spatially varying dielectric permittivity and explicit Born solvation energy for ions. We use the model to investigate the dielectric permittivity profile of confined water in molecular dynamics simulations of charged lipid layers stacks at varying hydration levels, and compare the results with alternative computational methods. The model captures a sharp decrease in permittivity upon dehydration, converging to a plateau value that we attribute to lipid headgroups. The generic nature of the mPB framework allows application to other systems, such as other biological interfaces or solid walls, provided ions follow Boltzmann statistics. Finally, the increase of the area per lipid in our tension-free simulations of the fluid membranes hints that the permittivity decrease upon dehydration is concomitant with an intermembrane attraction.

The interplay between quantum magnetism and many-body physics is of fundamental importance in condensed matter physics. %Magnetic exchange interactions in frustrated lattices give rise to rich phase diagrams. Molecular building blocks provide a versatile platform for exploring the exotic quantum phases arising from complex orderings in frustrated lattices. Here we demonstrate a showcase system based on altermagnetic Shastry-Sutherland fullerene networks, which can be constructed from a C$_{40}$ molecular synthon with two effective spin-1/2 sites due to the resonance structures. The charge-neutral, pure-carbon systems exhibit an altermagnetic ground state with fully compensated spins arranged in alternating C$_{40}$ units in a 2D rutile-like lattice, leading to $d$-wave splitting of the spin-polarised electronic band structure and strong chiral-split magnons. We report a rich phase diagram including altermagentic, quantum spin liquid, plaquette, and dimer phases, which can be accessed via moderate strains. Our findings open a new avenue for exploring quantum many-body physics based on scalable, chemically-feasible, molecular quantum materials.

Floquet-engineered moire quasicrystal patterns of ultracold Bose gases in twisted bilayer optical lattices

We investigate the formation of novel moiré quasicrystal patterns in Bose gases confined in twisted bilayer optical lattices via Floquet-engineered intralayer-atomic interactions. By introducing the density wave amplitude, we divide the dynamical evolution into four distinct stages and verify the pattern changes at each stage. The spatial symmetry of the patterns is closely linked to the modulation amplitudes and frequencies. Consequently, appropriately reducing the modulation frequency and increasing the amplitude facilitate lattice symmetry breaking and the subsequent emergence of rotational symmetry. Notably, a twelve-fold quasicrystal pattern emerges under specific parameters, closely resembling the moiré quasicrystal in twisted bilayer graphene. The momentum-space distributions also exhibit high rotational symmetry, consistent with the real-space patterns at specific evolution times. The patterns exhibit remarkable sensitivity to the modulation frequency, suggesting potential applications of this strongly frequency-dependent pattern formation in quantum precision measurement. Our findings establish a new quantum platform for exploring quasicrystals and their symmetry properties in ultracold bosonic systems.

Stochastic Compartment Model of Epidemic Spreading in Complex Networks with Mortality and Resetting

We propose an epidemic compartment model, which includes mortality caused by the disease, but excludes demographic birth and death processes. Individuals are represented by random walkers, which are in one of the following states (compartments) S (susceptible to infection), E (exposed: infected but not infectious corresponding to the latency period), I (infected and infectious), R (recovered, immune), D (dead). The disease is transmitted with a certain probability at contacts of I to S walkers. The compartmental sojourn times are independent random variables drawn from specific (here Gamma-) distributions. We implement this model into random walk simulations. Each walker performs an independent simple Markovian random walk on a graph, where we consider a Watts-Strogatz (WS) network. Only I walkers may die. For zero mortality, we prove the existence of an endemic equilibrium for basic reproduction number ${\cal R}_0 > 1$ and for which the disease free (globally healthy) state is unstable. We explore the effects of long-range-journeys (stochastic resetting) and mortality. Our model allows for various interpretations, such as certain chemical reactions, the propagation of wildfires, and in population dynamics.

Neural Transformer Backflow for Solving Momentum-Resolved Ground States of Strongly Correlated Materials

Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph)
Strongly correlated materials, such as twisted transition-metal dichalcogenide homobilayers, host a variety of exotic quantum phases but remain notoriously difficult to solve due to strong interactions. We introduce a powerful neural network ansatz, Neural Transformer Backflow (NTB), formulated within a multi-band projection framework. It naturally enforces momentum conservation and enables efficient calculations of momentum-resolved ground states. NTB attains high accuracy on small systems and scales to higher bands and larger system sizes far beyond the reach of exact diagonalization. By evaluating observables such as the structure factor and momentum distribution, we show that NTB captures diverse correlated states in tMoTe$_2$, including charge density waves, fractional Chern insulators, and anomalous Hall Fermi liquids, within a unified framework. Our approach paves the way for understanding and discovering novel phases of matter in strongly correlated materials.
