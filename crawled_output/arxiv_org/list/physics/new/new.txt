Title:
Elastic and Spin-Changing Cross Sections of Spin-Polarized Atomic Tritium
M. G. Elliott, B. J. P. Jones
Subjects:
Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)
The rates of elastic and inelastic scattering processes of spin-polarized atomic tritium are vital inputs for the design and operation of experiments using cold, magnetically trapped tritium atoms. Elastic scattering dominates the total cross section and dictates the thermophysical properties of the vapor, determining the efficiency of magnetic evaporative cooling and the fluid dynamical properties of the trapped atom cloud. Spin-changing cross sections in both exchange and dipolar channels determine the trap lifetime of the various hyperfine states, imposing constraints on the required atomic tritium supply rate to maintain a given trap density. Motivated by the needs of next-generation spectrometers that will study the tritium beta endpoint to infer the mass of the neutrino, we present new calculations of the elastic, spin-exchange and dipolar cross sections for spin polarized atomic tritium. Cross sections and rate constants are reported for magnetic field strengths of 0-10 T and temperatures from 0-100~K in all relevant Zeeman-hyperfine channels for both tritium and hydrogen. Results are bench-marked against past calculations for atomic hydrogen and the limited available results for tritium, and extend far into the regimes where past calculations have not been available.

Title:
Fast Electromagnetic and RF Circuit Co-Simulation for Passive Resonator Field Calculation and Optimization in MRI

Medical Physics (physics.med-ph)
Passive resonators have been widely used in MRI to manipulate RF field distributions. However, optimizing these structures using full-wave electromagnetic simulations is computationally prohibitive, particularly for large passive resonator arrays with many degrees of freedom. This work presents a co-simulation framework tailored specifically for the analysis and optimization of passive resonators. The framework performs a single full-wave electromagnetic simulation in which the resonator's lumped components are replaced by ports, followed by circuit-level computations to evaluate arbitrary capacitor and inductor configurations. This allows integration with a genetic algorithm to rapidly optimize resonator parameters and enhance the B1 field in a targeted region of interest (ROI). We validated the method in three scenarios: (1) a single-loop passive resonator on a spherical phantom, (2) a two-loop array on a cylindrical phantom, and (3) a two-loop array on a human head model. In all cases, the co-simulation results showed excellent agreement with full-wave simulations, with relative errors below 1%. The genetic-algorithm-driven optimization, involving tens of thousands of capacitor combinations, completed in under 5 minutes, whereas equivalent full-wave EM sweeps would require an impractically long computation time. This work extends co-simulation methodology to passive resonator design for first time, enabling the fast, accurate, and scalable optimization. The approach significantly reduces computational burden while preserving full-wave accuracy, making it a powerful tool for passive RF structure development in MRI.

The Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) is being upgraded from 1.0 GeV to 1.3 GeV (or 1.4 to 2.8 MW). Several water-cooled magnets have been upgraded to transport 30% higher beam energy. Fermilab contributed the magnet design for the new chicane magnets and injection/extraction septum. Designing the magnets was a challenging task because the new magnets required good combined integrated field quality and needed to occupy the old magnets space but with about 20% greater integrated magnetic field. Additional strong requirements applied to the magnets fringe field so as not to disturb the circulating beam. After fabrication of the magnets, an extensive measurement campaign was developed and performed at Fermilab's Magnet Test Facility. The measurements needed to assess magnet performance and provide comparison to design calculations. These included verification of field strength and harmonics along an 8 m length and 200 mm good field diameter for the chicane dipoles, end-field Hall probe mapping of these magnets, and measurements along two differently curved trajectories within the ~3 m septum gradient magnet. Details of the measurements and systems are presented along with results and comparison to field models.

Title:
Initialization-robust characterization of deep sub-electron read noise pixels via annealed PCH-EM

Subjects:
Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det)
We present an annealed Photon Counting Histogram Expectation Maximization (PCH-EM) algorithm for maximum likelihood characterization of Deep Sub-Electron Read Noise (DSERN) pixels. The annealed variant mitigates initialization-dependent convergence to suboptimal local optima of the likelihood function while achieving uncertainties substantially lower than the Photon Transfer (PT) method in the DSERN regime. Although the annealing principle is optimizer-agnostic, we pair it with PCH-EM for tractability; a single temperature parameter and simple cooling schedule suffice, without re-deriving the original EM update equations. Simulations across varied starting points show more stable parameter estimates with equal or better final likelihoods than the baseline. While designed for DSERN, the method applies across read-noise regimes and matches PT performance outside DSERN. Practically, the method enables reliable characterization of DSERN devices, including direct calibration from raw gray counts to electron counts for photon number resolving applications.

Fermilab is upgrading its Booster synchrotron to increase ramp rate and intensity. This is part of the Proton Improvement Plan (PIP-II) that will allow the Main Injector to achieve proton beam power of 1.2 MW within the next few years. This upgrade includes running the 55-year-old Booster magnets at 20 Hz instead of the usual 15 Hz, and construction of some shorter and wider aperture versions of these combined-function gradient magnets. Magnetic measurements were performed to characterize the present 15 Hz AC performance, and then again with 20 Hz ramp cycle to ensure performance and compatibility in this new operating regime. A 3 m-long curved flat-coil was developed for these measurements using Printed Circuit Board (PCB) technology. The probe also has a separate 0.5 m-long body-field probe, allowing integral, body, and end fields to be measured across 100 mm of the magnet aperture. The sampling rate for these measurements during the AC cycle was 200 kHz, and field resolution was better than 0.01%. Details of the probe, measurements, and results are presented.

Broadband Single-Shot THz Sampling Using Reflection Gratings

Optics (physics.optics); Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det)
Single-shot electro-optic sampling (EOS) is a powerful method enabling the measurement of weak terahertz signals that would otherwise require prohibitively long acquisition times. This is generally achieved by encoding the EOS time delay into a spatial, angular, or frequency coordinate. In general, this technique operates well up to 3 THz but becomes more challenging for larger bandwidths, due to dispersion and imaging imperfections. Here, we demonstrate a reliable angular-encoding single shot EOS implementation that reaches frequencies beyond 6 THz. Diffraction simulations are used to design the experimental setup and adapt this technique to commercial reflection gratings, removing the need for custom-built echelon mirrors. Furthermore, we show that, contrary to earlier reports, group delay dispersion from angular dispersion does not reduce the bandwidth of single-shot EOS.

The Fermilab Linac delivers 400MeV, 25mA H$^-$; beam. The longitudinal bunch parameters are reconstructed using a Bunch Shape Monitor (BSM) installed in the middle of the Linac. For that, the bunch length is measured as a function of the phase of an upstream cavity and fitted to simulations. The cavity gradient and its phase with respect to the beam are recovered from readings of Beam Position Monitors (BPMs). Since the cavity provides a significant transverse defocusing, the BSM measurements are correlated with transverse beam size measurements by a wire scanner (WS). Simulations connect these three types of measurements, allowing to deduce the longitudinal emittance and Courant-Snyder parameters.

Title:
An accurate mean-field equation for voter model dynamics on scale-free networks
Marvin Lücke, Stefanie Winkelmann, Péter Koltai
Subjects:
Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph)
Understanding the emergent macroscopic behavior of dynamical systems on networks is a crucial but challenging task. One of the simplest and most effective methods to construct a reduced macroscopic model is given by mean-field theory. The resulting approximations perform well on dense and homogeneous networks but poorly on scale-free networks, which, however, are more realistic in many applications. In this paper, we introduce a modified version of the mean-field approximation for voter model dynamics on scale-free networks. This approach achieves a significantly smaller approximation error than standard methods without increasing dimensionality.

Nuclear spin comagnetometers offer exceptional precision in measurements of spin energy levels and exhibit long-term stability, making them powerful tools for probing spin-dependent physics beyond the Standard Model as well as for inertial rotation sensing. We describe a new $^{3}$He-$^{21}$Ne Ramsey comagnetometer operating with an in-situ $^{87}$Rb magnetometer for initialization and sensing of nuclear spins. During free precession of nuclear spins we turn off all lasers and introduce a microwave field to suppress back-action from Rb atoms. We demonstrate that scalar and dipolar interactions between nuclear spins can be eliminated via control of the polarized sample geometry. These improvements result in a bias-free measurement with a frequency sensitivity of 0.6 nHz after 6 hours of integration.

The Side-Coupled Linac (SCL) section of the FNAL linac accelerates the beam from 117 MeV to 401.5 MeV, operating at 22-24 mA beam current. Transverse focusing is performed by 32 quadrupoles, and the beam orbit is guided by 19 dipole correctors and measured by 29 BPMs. The bunch length is measured in a single location by a Bunch Shape Monitor (BSM). This paper presents a three-step reconstruction of the machine optics. First, the transverse and longitudinal Twiss parameters at the start of the SCL section are determined using quadrupole scans and BSM measurements at different settings of an upstream cavity. Second, the quadrupole calibrations are adjusted based on differential-trajectory measurements. Finally, the beam is propagated along the SCL linac using the code TraceWin. A comparison between TraceWin simulations and the beam envelope measured by the 12 wire scanners of the SCL linac was performed. Transverse and longitudinal beam parameters at the entrance of the transition section will be reported.

Developments in ultrastable lasers have fueled remarkable advances in optical frequency metrology and quantum science. A key ingredient in further improving laser frequency stability is the use of low-noise mirror materials such as AlGaAs crystalline coatings. However, excess noise observed with these coatings limits the performance of cryogenic silicon cavities with AlGaAs mirrors to similar levels achieved with conventional dielectric coatings. With a new pair of crystalline coated mirrors in a 6-cm-long cryogenic silicon cavity operated at 17 K, we demonstrate a clear advantage of crystalline coatings over dielectric coatings. The achieved fractional frequency stability of $2.5 \times 10^{-17}$ at 10 s is four times better than expected for dielectric mirrors and corresponds to more than tenfold reduction in the coating mechanical loss factor. We also combine two silicon cavities to demonstrate optical frequency averaging for enhanced stability. In addition, we present a long-term frequency drift record of four cryogenic silicon cavities measured over several years. These results open up realistic prospects for cavity-stabilized lasers with $10^{-18}$ fractional stability, as well as an all-optical timescale with continuously operating optical local oscillators.

Exact mid-IR quantum vibrational spectra of neutral water clusters

Subjects:
Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph)
We use selected configuration interaction to calculate the zero-temperature mid-infrared (2800-3800 cm$^{-1}$) vibrational spectra of a water monomer, dimer, trimer, and hexamer in its cage and prism geometries. We use the recently introduced, accurate q-AQUA-pol potential energy surface along with the n-mode representation of the potential to facilitate grid-based quadrature and integral storage. Within selected configuration interaction, we introduce a new approach to the calculation of spectra that is complementary to eigenstate enumeration. In the new approach, we calculate the spectrum using the response-vector method, and the system of linear equations is solved using a basis of configurations that are optimally selected at each frequency of interest. We compare our spectra to previous studies, and highlight limitations of the local monomer approximation. To the best of our knowledge, our hexamer spectra are the most accurate ones reported to date.

Title:
Quantum Dial for High-Harmonic Generation

Subjects:
Optics (physics.optics); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
High-harmonic generation (HHG) is a highly nonlinear optical process that typically requires an intense laser to trigger emissions at integer multiples of the driving field frequency. Since HHG is commonly used as a spectroscopic tool to probe material properties, it becomes impossible to extract information about a material without introducing distortions caused by the strong driving field. Recent advances in bright squeezed vacuum sources have allowed HHG to be driven by purely quantum fields alone. Our work focuses on controlling and tuning HHG emission using a weak classical driving field with energy 1000 times less than that used in conventional HHG experiments, perturbed by an even weaker quantum field, such as bright squeezed vacuum (BSV). Our technique opens new avenues for nonlinear spectroscopy of materials by minimizing issues such as laser-induced damage, distortions, and heating. Our results show that a BSV pulse, containing less than 0.5% of the driving laser energy, can serve as an optical dial for tuning nonlinear emission, electron dynamics, and ionization.

Recording changes in beam transverse positions re-ported by Beam Position Monitors (BPMs) in response to a beam deflection by an upstream dipole corrector (orbit response) is a powerful tool for analysis of accelerator optics and assisting with machine tuning. In the Fermilab Linac, orbit responses are recorded by oscillating the currents of up to 19 correctors, providing faster, drift-resistant measurements through frequency-domain analysis. This report describes the technique, including error estimations and consistency checks and shows an example of the measurements.

Evolution of surfactant-free 'pristine' emulsions

The term pristine interface was introduced by Beattie and Djerdjev 20 years ago for emulsions that consist of only water and oil with no surfactant. They are different from Pickering emulsions, which are also surfactant-free but stabilized with colloidal particles. In contrast to previous studies, we monitor the kinetics of the initial stages of emulsion formation. We conducted such tests in an open setup when samples are open to air and CO2 content in the water varies, and in closed setup when samples are isolated with fixed CO2 content. For the open setup, sonication and initial pH > 9 leads to emulsions with high zeta potential and sub-micron droplet size. There are two evolution patterns: short- and long-terms. The short term lasts about 1 day and has changing pH and zeta potential, but almost constant droplet size. The long term is is over several days or even weeks, with droplet size increase toward saturation value (rate dependent on mixing conditions), with pH and zeta potential remaining constant. Emulsification at the closed setup is much less pronounced and pH remains constant. This difference points to the importance of adsorbed CO2 and related carbonate ions in the formation of pristine emulsions and charging droplets interfaces. We hypothesize the existence of structured water molecule layer at the interface, following Eastoe and Ellis. The Electric Double Layer exerts a (dielectrostatic) force on the water dipole moments in this layer that compensates the Kelvins pressure. The droplet size from this model is close to our measurements. Also, there is a repulsion of the water dipole moments, which compensates for the surface tension parallel to the interface. After ruling out alternative hypotheses with our data, we conclude that the model suggested for explaining the stability of nano-bubbles is also consistent with our results for these pristine emulsions.

Purpose: The expansion of radiopharmaceutical therapy (RPT) development demands scalable preclinical dosimetry methods. While PET and SPECT remain the gold standards, their low throughput and high cost limit large-cohort studies. Cherenkov luminescence imaging (CLI) offers a high-throughput alternative but suffers from depth-dependent attenuation and photon scatter that compromise quantitative accuracy. This work develops and validates a quantitative CLI methodology incorporating attenuation and scatter corrections for accurate preclinical dosimetry. Methods: Depth-dependent attenuation was characterized using a tissue-mimicking phantom to derive calibration coefficients. Photon scatter was modeled using GEANT4-generated Cherenkov spread functions (CSFs), applied in a depth-weighted iterative Richardson--Lucy deconvolution/reconvolution framework. The method was evaluated in NU/NU mice (n=4) bearing MC38 tumors after injection of $^{86}$Y-NM600, an isotope suitable for both PET and CLI. Liver and tumor activities were quantified at four timepoints using PET and the proposed CLI method. Monte Carlo dosimetry was performed for both modalities. Results: CLI--PET activity quantification yielded mean errors of 15.4% (liver) and 10.3% (tumor) over the first three timepoints. Tumor absorbed doses from CLI-derived synthetic PET images (3.4 $\pm$ 0.3 Gy/MBq) were statistically indistinguishable from PET-based estimates (3.2 $\pm$ 0.2 Gy/MBq, $p=0.31$). Discrepancies increased at late timepoints due to low activity and background auto-luminescence. Conclusions: With appropriate depth-dependent attenuation calibration and Monte Carlo--derived scatter correction, CLI can provide quantitative biodistribution and dosimetry estimates comparable to PET. This approach enables high-throughput, low-cost in vivo dosimetry, expanding the feasibility of large-scale preclinical RPT studies.

Certain topological systems with time-varying Hamiltonian enable quantized and disorder-robust transport of excitations. Here, we introduce the modification of the celebrated Thouless pump when the on-site energies remain fixed, while the nearest and next-nearest neighbor couplings vary in time. We demonstrate quantized transport of excitations and propose an experimental implementation using an array of evanescently coupled optical waveguides.

Biological Physics (physics.bio-ph); Cell Behavior (q-bio.CB)
In multicellular systems, adhesion complexes, such as those composed of E-cadherin and associated catenins, mechanically couple neighboring cells by directly linking their actin-based cytoskeletal assemblies. However, the mechanics of how forces are transmitted across these adhesions remains largely unstudied. Here, we introduce a biophysical model that explicitly couples adhesion complex dynamics to intracellular mechanics across cell boundaries. A cadherin dimer plus associated catenins connecting two cells is represented as a spring whose ends experience drag with respect to the moving actin cytoskeleton. The cytoskeleton is modeled as a contractile gel driven by myosin activity in its bulk and forces from adhesion on its boundaries. Our model captures this bidirectional coupling via a coarse-grained continuum framework and reveals a range of observed cell- and tissue-scale behaviors. These include global cell polarization of the multicellular collective, other polarization patterns and oscillatory dynamics, spontaneously formed actin rings within cells, and supracellular stress chains. Many of these features arise from modeling the direct mechanical coupling between cytoskeleton and adhesion. This model can be extended to other adhesion-cytoskeleton feedback systems and used to advance our understanding of multicellular tissue dynamics, particularly during development.

The need for high-temperature piezoelectric microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) requires pushing piezoelectric platforms to their thermal limits. In harsh thermal environments, piezoelectric MEMS devices are expected to sustain severe damage because of material degradation and coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatches between the functional layers and the carrier wafer. This paper investigates the thermal endurance of the suspended thin-film lithium niobate (LN) platform by observing the structural integrity and performance of acoustic Lamb wave resonators after annealing rounds at increasing temperatures, with a focus on temperatures between 550 $^\circ$C and 800 $^\circ$C, with 50 $^\circ$C temperature increments. Fundamental symmetric (S0) mode acoustic resonators are fabricated on 600 nm stoichiometric LN (sLN) with 40 nm thick platinum top electrodes and a thin titanium adhesion layer. After each annealing round, changes in the devices' resonant frequency and quality factor (\emph{Q}) are quantitatively studied. The devices and material stack are further analyzed with resistivity structures, optical microscope images, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. The results provide valuable insights into the design and material selection necessary to optimize the suspended thin-film LN platform for high temperatures. Understanding the thermal limit of the platform enables its use for sensors, actuators, resonators, and potentially other thin-film LN microsystems, e.g, photonics, electro-optical, and acousto-optical systems in harsh thermal environments.

Magneto-Rheological (MR) fluid based devices work on the principle of changing the rheological properties of MR fluid (MRF) using magnetic field excitation generated from an electromagnet. The electromagnet is usually created with the aid of copper coils wound on a low magnetic permeable spindle structure referred to as bobbin. In this paper, an attempt has been made to investigate the different bobbin configurations and its effect on the torque transmissibility of a MR clutch (MRC). A hybrid corrugated- plane type transmission surface MRC is chosen for the study, due to the advantage of enhanced transmission capability due to the simultaneous existence of plane and corrugated extensions on the disc surface. This enhanced transmission capability, resulting from the hybrid corrugated plane type transmission surface facilitates mama,. BB vg BBC gg of the influence of bobbin configuration on the torque transmission capability in an MRC. A comparative analysis using COMSOL Multiphysics software is carried out between five different innovative bobbin configurations such as rectangular, semi-circular, conical, I-sectioned and H-sectioned. This study aims to simulate and reason the variations in the magnetic field line characteristics upon variations in bobbin topography. The results obtained testify for the need of a bobbin design taking into account the transmission surface geometry. For the specific design analyzed, it was found that the H-sectioned bobbin provided the maximum torque transmission capability when compared with other topographies, whereas the conical shaped bobbin topography proved to be least facilitating for torque transmission.

Generative Consistency Models for Estimation of Kinetic Parametric Image Posteriors in Total-Body PET

Subjects:
Medical Physics (physics.med-ph)
Dynamic total body positron emission tomography (TB-PET) makes it feasible to measure the kinetics of all organs in the body simultaneously which may lead to important applications in multi-organ disease and systems physiology. Since whole-body kinetics are highly heterogeneous with variable signal-to-noise ratios, parametric images should ideally comprise not only point estimates but also measures of posterior statistical uncertainty. However, standard Bayesian techniques, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), are computationally prohibitive at the total body scale. We introduce a generative consistency model (CM) that generates samples from the posterior distributions of the kinetic model parameters given measured time-activity curves and arterial input function. CM is able to collapse the hundreds of iterations required by standard diffusion models into just 3 denoising steps. When trained on 500,000 physiologically realistic two-tissue compartment model simulations, the CM produces similar accuracy to MCMC (median absolute percent error < 5%; median K-L divergence < 0.5) but is more than five orders of magnitude faster. CM produces more reliable Ki images than the Patlak method by avoiding the assumption of irreversibility, while also offering valuable information on statistical uncertainty of parameter estimates and the underlying model. The proposed framework removes the computational barrier to routine, fully Bayesian parametric imaging in TB-PET and is readily extensible to other tracers and compartment models.

We propose a broadband, femtosecond two-photon excitation scheme for efficient population transfer to the ultra-narrow linewidth $1s2s\ ^1S_0$ metastable state in helium. Using $120$ nm vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) femtosecond laser pulses, we theoretically demonstrate that a direct two-photon excitation process can achieve a population transfer efficiency of $25-30\%$, even when photoionization losses are included. The use of broadband pulses enables multiple excitation pathways to populate the excited state, in addition to compensating for significant AC Stark shifts occurring within the pulse duration. Furthermore, we introduce a two-color two-photon extreme ultraviolet-near infrared (XUV-IR) excitation scheme that will further reduce ionization losses and can achieve significantly higher transfer efficiencies of $\sim 70\%$. These results demonstrate that high excitation probability of ultra-narrow linewidth ($\sim 50$ Hz) excited states can be achieved with experimentally accessible femtosecond laser sources with a few THz bandwidth.

Neural operators have emerged as cost-effective surrogates for expensive fluid-flow simulators, particularly in computationally intensive tasks such as permeability inversion from time-lapse seismic data, and uncertainty quantification. In these applications, the fidelity of the surrogate's gradients with respect to system parameters is crucial, as the accuracy of downstream tasks, such as optimization and Bayesian inference, relies directly on the quality of the derivative information. Recent advances in physics-informed methods have leveraged derivative information to improve surrogate accuracy. However, incorporating explicit Jacobians can become computationally prohibitive, as the complexity typically scales quadratically with the number of input parameters. To address this limitation, we propose DeFINO (Derivative-based Fisher-score Informed Neural Operator), a reduced-order, derivative-informed training framework. DeFINO integrates Fourier neural operators (FNOs) with a novel derivative-based training strategy guided by the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM). By projecting Jacobians onto dominant eigen-directions identified by the FIM, DeFINO captures critical sensitivity information directly informed by observational data, significantly reducing computational expense. We validate DeFINO through synthetic experiments in the context of subsurface multi-phase fluid-flow, demonstrating improvements in gradient accuracy while maintaining robust forward predictions of underlying fluid dynamics. These results highlight DeFINO's potential to offer practical, scalable solutions for inversion problems in complex real-world scenarios, all at substantially reduced computational cost.

Droplet at the Corner of a V-Shaped Fiber
Yi Zhang, Apurav Tambe, Zhao Pan
Subjects:
Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
A fundamental question in the physics of droplet--fiber interactions is: What is the maximum droplet volume a fiber can retain? While this problem has been studied for horizontal fibers and at the apex $\Lambda$-shaped bent fibers, it remains less explored for V-shaped bent fibers, despite their demonstrated advantages in engineering applications such as fog harvesting. This work investigates the capability of V-shaped fibers in retaining droplets against gravity. An analytical model to predict the maximum droplet volume on V-shaped fibers is developed based on free energy analysis, and validated against experimental data from five liquid--fiber pairs. The dependence of the maximum droplet volume on $\alpha$ can be reasonably captured by the function $\cos\beta/\cos\left(\beta-\alpha/2\right)$, where $\beta$ denotes the droplet's off-axis angle. As $\alpha$ increases from $0^\circ$ to $180^\circ$, the maximum droplet volume slightly decreases before entering a broad transition region around $\alpha \approx 40^\circ$--$100^\circ$, and then increases at larger $\alpha$.

We report on a high-power mid-infrared femtosecond master oscillator power amplifier (MOPA) system, employing Cr:ZnS and Cr:ZnSe polycrystals with fine-tuned doping profiles. Based on the soft-aperture Kerr-lens mode-locking in the soliton regime, the seed oscillator generates ~40-fs pulses with a repetition rate ~173 MHz with an average power close to 400 mW. The amplification process of the seed pulse train is investigated in depth in a single-pass configuration for both Cr:ZnS and Cr:ZnSe crystal rods. For further power scaling, a dual-stage MOPA system has been implemented, generating pulse trains with an average power up to 10.4 W, limited only by the pump source, with a re-compressed pulse duration of 78 fs using a dispersion compensator comprising chirped mirrors and sapphire plates. This work paves the way for further power scaling of mid-infrared Cr:ZnS/ZnSe ultrafast laser systems without moving parts for applications in material processing, remote sensing and medicine.

Sensitivity of literature $T_1$ mapping methods to the underlying magnetization transfer parameters
Jakob Assländer
Subjects:
Medical Physics (physics.med-ph); Biological Physics (physics.bio-ph)
Purpose: Magnetization transfer (MT) has been identified as the principal source of $T_1$ variability in the MRI literature. This study assesses the sensitivity of established $T_1$ mapping techniques to variations in the underlying MT parameters.
Methods: For each $T_1$-mapping method, the observed $T_1$ was simulated as a function of the underlying MT parameters $p_i^\text{MT}$, corresponding to different brain regions of interest (ROIs) at 3T. As measures of sensitivity, the derivatives $\partial T_1^\text{observed} / \partial p_i^\text{MT}$ were computed and analyzed with a linear mixed-effects model as a function of $p_i^\text{MT}$, ROI, pulse sequence type (e.g., inversion recovery, variable flip angle), and the individual sequences.
Results: The analyzed $T_1$-mapping sequences have a considerable sensitivity to changes in the semi-solid spin pool size $m_0^\text{s}$, $T_1^\text{f}$ of the free, $T_1^\text{s}$ of the semi-solid spin pool, and the (inverse) exchange rate $T_\text{x}$. All derivatives vary considerably with the underlying MT parameters and between pulse sequences. The derivatives can, in general, not be determined by the sequence type, but rather depend on implementation details of the sequence. One notable exception is that variable-flip-angle methods are, in general, more sensitive to the exchange rate than inversion-recovery methods.
Conclusion: Variations in $T_1$ measurements can be caused by several underlying MT parameters, and the sensitivity to each parameter depends on both the underlying MT parameters and the sequence.

Probing the dynamics of superconductor phase transitions induced by strong electromagnetic fields is vital to designing high power devices leveraging these materials. The development of high temperature superconductors (HTS) is particularly interesting due to critical temperatures ($T_c$) approaching 90 K, the ability to support high current densities, and their ability to operate in strong static magnetic fields. This work aims to determine the transition dynamics of these materials at radio-frequencies (rf) in the microwave range where they have enormous potential for new applications ranging from particle accelerators to dark matter searches. We have tested two types of coatings formed from rare earth barium copper oxide (REBCO): a film deposited by electron-beam physical vapor deposition, and HTS conductor tapes soldered to a copper substrate with exposed REBCO surfaces. Testing was performed via a hemispherical transverse-electric mode cavity that maximizes the surface rf magnetic field and minimizes the surface electric field on a 2-inch diameter sample. We report on steady-state measurements at low rf power, as well as fully time-resolved transition dynamics on the microsecond timescale seen for the first time with strong surface rf fields.

Towards an Evidence-Based Approach to Climate Policy

Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph)
Evidence-Based Climate Policy (EBCP) is an approach to policymaking that relies on evidence to make decisions about managing climate impacts, mitigation, and adaptation. A core problem for EBCP is the lack of a clear definition of evidence, a fundamental concept to the theory. The literature often draws on evidence-based medicine (EBM), where evidence is typically empirical data from scientific research or systematic investigations and quality is arranged within an evidence hierarchy with randomized controlled trials and meta-analysis on top. However, this conception and hierarchy is insufficient for EBCP, which requires context-appropriate evidence, such as expert judgments, model-based probabilities, and scenario analysis. In EBCP what counts as evidence must be reassessed for relevance, quality and availability in the specific context. To demonstrate different types of evidence used in EBCP, this research is based on a case study on PNACC-3.

The electric double layer (EDL) governs electrocatalysis, energy conversion, and storage, yet its atomic structure, capacitance, and reactivity remain elusive. Here we introduce a machine learning interatomic potential framework that incorporates long-range electrostatics, enabling nanosecond simulations of metal-electrolyte interfaces under applied electric bias with near-quantum-mechanical accuracy. At the benchmark Pt(111)/water and Pt(111)/aqueous KF electrolyte interfaces, we resolve the molecular structure of the EDL, reveal proton-transfer mechanisms underlying anodic water dissociation and the diffusion of ionic water species, and compute differential capacitance. We find that the nominally inert K+ and F- ions, while leaving interfacial water structure largely unchanged, screen bulk fields, slow proton transfer, and generate a prominent capacitance peak near the potential of zero charge. These results show that ion-specific interactions, which are ignored in mean-field models, are central to capacitance and reactivity, providing a molecular basis for interpreting experiments and designing electrolytes.

Shape optimization for trailing-edge noise reduction using large-eddy simulation and ensemble-based method
Qingyong Luo, Xin-Lei Zhang, Guowei He
Subjects:
Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
In this work, the trailing-edge shape of an airfoil is optimized to reduce the acoustic noise based on large-eddy simulation (LES). It is achieved by the ensemble Kalman method, which can enhance the optimization efficiency by using the gradient of cost function approximated with sample covariances. Moreover, the update scheme is reformulated to impose smoothness regularization and enable simultaneous reduction in the trailing edge noise and the drag-to-lift ratio. The trailing edge is optimized with a reduced bevel angle based on the ensemble Kalman method. The flow field near the optimal trailing edge shows that the flow separation and vortex shedding are suppressed compared to the baseline shape, indicating a significant decrease in the drag-to-lift ratio and noise generation. Also, the spectral proper orthogonal decomposition method is used to analyze the flow structure around the trailing edge, identifying that the optimal shape achieves acoustic noise reduction by disrupting large-scale flow structures. Further, the spectrum of Lighthill stress reveals that the optimal trailing edge suppresses the high-frequency noise through the nonlinear interaction of reduced low-frequency velocity fluctuations.

We demonstrate a compact strontium (Sr) magneto-optical trap (MOT) realized in a single vacuum chamber without a Zeeman slower or a two-dimensional MOT. The MOT is directly loaded from a thermal atomic beam generated by an atomic oven. The entire vacuum chamber is maintained by a single ion pump, without employing differential pumping. At an oven temperature of $395\,\mathrm{{}^\circ C}$, the number of atoms in the MOT reaches $10^7$ with a loading rate of $10^7 \,\mathrm{atoms\,s^{-1}}$, while sustaining a background gas pressure in the $10^{-9} \,\mathrm{Torr}$ range. At this oven temperature, the MOT lifetime limited by collisions with background gas is $\sim 5 \,\mathrm{s}$, with the atom number primarily constrained by light-assisted two-body collisions. Our MOT system significantly simplifies the construction of field-deployable optical lattice clocks.

Biological Physics (physics.bio-ph)
The dynamics of active viscoelastic surfaces plays an important role in biological systems. One prominent example is the actin cortex, a thin bio-polymer sheet underneath the outer membrane of biological cells which combines active molecular force generation with viscoelastic behavior characterized by elastic properties at short timescales and viscous properties at longer timescales. We consider a surface Maxwell model within dominant rheology and an additional active term to model the dynamics of the actin cortex. This captures both, shear and dilational surface dynamics. We propose a monolithic numerical approach based on the surface finite element method (SFEM), validate the results for special cases and experimentally demonstrate convergence properties. Moreover, imposing a ring-shaped region of an enhanced active stress mimicking the contractile ring during cytokinesis, we observe different types of emergent patterns and shape dynamics depending on the viscoelastic properties. While viscous surfaces show a ring, which slips to one side of the surface, viscoelasticity provides a stabilization mechanism of the ring, thus forming a requirement for subsequent cell division. This study provides an example that viscoelastic properties are key ingredients to understand biological materials.

Reducing Temperature Swing and Rectifying Radiative Heat Transfer for Passive Dynamic Space Thermal Control with Variable-Emittance Coatings
Liping Wang, Neal Boman, Sydney Taylor, Chloe Stoops
Subjects:
Applied Physics (physics.app-ph); Optics (physics.optics)
Dynamic radiative thermal control is crucial for normal operation and energy saving of spacecraft that copes with changing thermal environment involving heat dissipation to cold deep space, external heating from the Sun and nearby planet, and internal heating from onboard electronics. Variable-emittance coatings, whose infrared emittance can be tuned passively by temperature or actively by external stimuli, could provide a viable solution. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate self-adaptive dynamic radiative heat transfer with variable-emittance coating based on thermochromic VO2 in space-like thermal environment with a coldfinger and a custom-made sample mount inside a vacuum cryostat. Black Actar and highly reflective tungsten mirror are used to calibrate the parasitic head load and heat flux sensor sensitivity, while multiple static-emittance samples made of silicon wafers with different doping levels are measured for validation of the experimental method and for direct comparison with the variable-emittance VO2 coating. With the coldfinger at 80 K to mimic external radiative scenarios in space, the tunable coating exhibits 6-fold enhancement in radiative thermal conductance upon VO2 phase transition for promoted heat dissipation, in addition to reduced temperature swing by almost 20degC compared to the static emitters. With the coldfinger at 25degC as internal radiative scenarios in space, similar 6-fold heat dissipation from the variable-emittance coating is also observed, while radiative heat transfer is much suppressed with a constant radiative thermal conductance when the coldfinger is hotter than the tunable coating at 25degC, leading to a thermal rectification factor of 1.8 experimentally achieved.

The role of angular slit number and angular slit width on the OAM spectrum
Jayson P. Cabanilla, Nathaniel Hermosa
Comments:

Subjects:
Optics (physics.optics)
The uncertainty principle sets the limit for simultaneous measurements of position and momentum, and its angular analogue is realized through angular diffraction. When a beam is spatially confined by angular slits, the uncertainty in its orbital angular momentum (OAM) increases, leading to the generation of OAM sidebands. Both the angular slit number and the angular slit width shapes the spatial confinement of the beam. In this study, we investigate this dependence of the OAM sidebands by obstructing a Gaussian beam with $N$ number of evenly spaced angular slits with angular separation $\Delta\theta_{sep}$. The power distribution among the OAM sidebands exhibits oscillatory behavior as a function of $\Delta\theta_{sep}$. We find that the number of oscillations over the full range $0 \leq \Delta\theta_{sep} \leq 2\pi/N$ is given by the ratio $\frac{|l|}{N}$. Furthermore, each OAM sideband acquires power only when $\frac{|l|}{N}$ takes an integer value, thereby demonstrating the role of the angular slit geometry to the structure of the OAM sidebands.

High particle rates in current and future experiments make pile-up phenomena a critical issue for extracting useful information. In this context, timing can be important as the 4$^{\mathrm{th}}$ dimension parameter for triggering or event reconstruction. The PICOSEC-Micromegas detector has been shown to offer precise timing of the order of tens of\,ps. In this work, novel signal processing algorithms are being developed and evaluated to demonstrate the technology's ability for online precise timing. We propose, an algorithm based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). This algorithm uses a model to train the ANN. The performance of the different algorithms is evaluated using experimental data, resulting in a timing resolution of 18.3 $\pm$ 0.6\,ps, comparable to the standard analysis based on the Constant Fraction Discrimination technique. Additionally, an alternative algorithm using the charge of the pulse exceeding a threshold as a parameter to correct for systematic effects is reported.

We report experimental evidence of the interaction between intersubband polaritons and longitudinal optical phonons in non-dispersive mid-infrared cavities, under resonant optical injection. The light emission originating from spontaneous polariton-phonon scattering is observed at a frequency corresponding to an energy shift of one phonon below the pump frequency. Given the extremely low spontaneous scattering rate, we employ a custom-developed quantum mechanical model to numerically demonstrate the feasibility to stimulate such process using a pump-probe scheme. Based on this analysis, we identify a set of experimental conditions under which optical gain may be realized in a mid-infrared intersubband polaritonic system.

Heat production in Ni-based thin films interacting with hydrogen gas was studied using a radiation calorimeter equipped with a composite photon-detector system. Measurements were performed on pure Ni foil and NiCu composite thin films. Electromagnetic radiation emitted from samples heated to approximately 1100 K in vacuum was recorded over the energy range of 0.05 - 2.5 eV. In this study,detailed spectra were obtained, particularly in the low-energy region below 0.5 eV. The peak of the thermal radiation spectrum was observed around 0.2 eV, deviating from that expected for simple graybody radiation. Spectral variations depending on the presence or absence of hydrogen differed between the NiCu and pure Ni samples. The total radiated energy was determined directly from the measured radiation power, without relying on radiation models. The excess heat generated in the NiCu sample was estimated to be approximately 1.1 W. A comparable but slightly smaller excess heat generation was also observed in Ni. Long-term measurements of the NiCu sample demonstrated sustained excess heat production for at least 215 hours, with a decay time exceeding 2000 hours.

Laser-based manufacturing has emerged as a promising alternative to conventional thermal and mechanical processing owing to its precision, versatility, and ability to work across diverse materials. In particular, tailoring the spatial intensity distribution of laser beams on the fly is pivotal for ensuring keyhole stability, minimizing defects, and enhancing processing quality. To address this need, we propose a multifunctional optical platform designed through a Diffractive Neural Network that provides wavelength adaptability for three industrially relevant wavelengths - 915 nm, 1064 nm, and 1550 nm - while dynamically generating distinct beam profiles at specified propagation planes. The proposed platform not only enables static beam shaping but also supports dynamic beam engineering, including programmable sequencing between profiles, which is highly desirable for optimal manufacturing solutions. With its multifunctionality and adaptability, the DNN-based architecture establishes a transformative pathway for next-generation laser manufacturing, aligning with the industrial revolution while unlocking opportunities in biomedical optics, free-space communications, and sensing.

Surfing on chemical waves: a simple yet dynamically rich two-sphere responsive gel swimmer

Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
Self-oscillating gels are chemically-responsive hydrogels coupled to an oscillating chemical reaction of a stimulus solute. In response to the oscillating solute concentration field, responsive gels periodically swell and deswell, expelling their adsorbed water as they transition to a drier state, and reswelling once they return to a hydrophilic state. This volume phase transition occurs when the local stimulus concentration crosses a critical value, about which the hydrophilicity of the polymer chains changes abruptly. These gels have been used to make surface crawlers or other pulsatile machines, but here we show that a very simple system comprising two oscillating gel spheres linked by a rigid rod can also swim in the inertialess Stokes regime - albeit rather slowly. Developing a full continuum-mechanical model for a gel that employs a reaction described by the Brusselator model to generate oscillating chemical concentrations that couple to gel and fluid dynamics, we quantify the rate of shrinkage and swelling and associated flows as the gels pump out or draw in water. Herein, we derive analytical results for the swimming velocity of these swimmers, and upon placing them in a solute bath, identify two modes of behaviour upon encountering propagating reaction-diffusion waves: 'bobbing' and 'surfing'. Though somewhat slower than flagellated swimmers, the relative simplicity of the system, with no hinges or moving components, lends itself well to large scale production.

The optical transmission spectra of a series of micro-ring resonators (MRRs) are studied following the implantation of gold (Au) ions and subsequent thermal annealing, at temperatures between 500 °C and 700 °C. Whilst we find that this process leads to the ready formation of Au nanoparticles (NPs) on the MRR surface, the cavity optical properties; Q-factor and extinction ratio (ER) are severely degraded, for annealing between 500 °C and 600 °C, but recover again for annealing at 650 °C. For an equivalent (control) MRR, which received no Au implantation, thermal annealing alone was also found to degrade the cavity performance.

The evolution of light theories began with Isaac Newton's corpuscular model, which explained reflection and refraction but could not account for diffraction and interference. In contrast, Christiaan Huygens proposed a wave theory, explaining light's behavior through an ether-based medium, supported by his principle that each point in a wavefront acts as a secondary source. This idea was experimentally supported in the early nineteenth century when Thomas Young's double-slit experiment revealed an interference pattern, affirming light's wave nature. Later, James Clerk Maxwell unified electricity and magnetism, establishing light as an electromagnetic wave and extending the electromagnetic spectrum beyond visible light. In the twentieth century, Einstein's photoelectric effect introduced the concept of wave-particle duality, demonstrating that light behaves as discrete photons. Soon after, Louis de Broglie extended the idea of wave-particle duality to matter, a prediction confirmed in 1927 when Clinton Davisson and Lester Germer observed electron diffraction from a crystal and, independently, G.P. Thomson demonstrated electron diffraction through thin films, both proving that electrons also exhibit wave-like properties. This concept was dramatically visualized by Claus Jonsson's 1961 electron double-slit experiment. Recently, the ALICE collaboration observed quantum interference patterns at the femtometer scale in ultra-relativistic nuclear collisions, pushing quantum interference studies to new frontiers.

A method is proposed to generate coherent, intense zeptosecond x-ray pulses by using the electron beam produced by a laser wakefield accelerator (LWFA) stage as the driver for a beam driven plasma wakefield accelerator (PWFA) stage. The LWFA injector stage requires a readily available 100 TW laser driver to produce a GeV class self-injected electron beam. This beam is focused and used as the driver in a PWFA stage that utilizes a solid-density plasma with a modulated density downramp. The concept is shown to be capable of producing an ultra-short electron beam with unprecedented density ($10^{26}~\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$) and brightness ($ 10^{24}~\ampere/\meter^2/\radian ^2$), that is also pre-bunched on 0.1 Angstrom scales. By colliding this pre-bunched extreme beam with an optical undulator, an intense zeptosecond pulse can be emitted if the spatially focusing region is matched with the lasing region of the beam. Multi-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations are performed of the entire concept to demonstrate that an isolated 10 GW-class zeptosecond pulse with a full-width-half-maximum duration of 700 zs can be generated in a tapered laser pulse. Such an intense zeptosecond pulse generation scheme may provide an essential probe for nuclear physics and quantum electrodynamics processes.

Silicon is a promising anode material for next-generation lithium-ion batteries due to its exceptionally high specific capacity (3600 mAh g$^{-1}$), significantly exceeding that of conventional graphite. However, its practical application is hindered by substantial volume expansion (300-400%) during lithiation, leading to mechanical degradation and capacity fade. A graphite-coated silicon core-shell structure has been proposed to mitigate these issues by combining silicon's capacity with graphite's structural stability. Despite this, experimental studies have shown that the usable capacity of such composite electrodes can remain low, often below 40% at 1C, especially under high-rate cycling. In this work, we develop a physics-based electrochemical model to investigate the charge-discharge behaviour, rate limitations, and degradation mechanisms of silicon-graphite core-shell anodes. The model incorporates lithium transport, interfacial kinetics, evolving contact area due to silicon expansion, and a simplified cracking framework to capture loss of active material. Results are validated against key experimental trends and used to explore the effects of particle size, shell thickness, and charge protocol, offering insights into the design of more durable and efficient Si-based composite anodes.

We have developed an optical simulator to test optical two-way time-frequency transfer (O-TWTFT) at the femtosecond level capable of simulating relative motion between two linked optical clock nodes up to Mach 1.8 with no moving parts. The technique is enabled by artificially Doppler shifting femtosecond pulses from auxiliary stabilized optical frequency combs. These pulses are exchanged between the nodes to simulate the Doppler shifts observed from a changing optical path length. We can continuously scan the simulated velocity from 14 to 620 m/s while simultaneously measuring velocity-dependent clock shifts at much higher velocities than has been previously recorded. This system provides an effective testbed that allows us to explore issues and solutions to enable femtosecond-level optical time transfer at high velocity.

We report a systematic uncertainty of $9.2\times 10^{-19}$ for the USTC Sr1 optical lattice clock, achieving accuracy at the level required for the roadmap of the redefinition of the SI second. A finite-element model with {\it in situ}-validated, spatially-resolved chamber emissivity reduced blackbody radiation shift uncertainty to $6.3\times 10^{-19}$. Concurrently, an externally mounted lattice cavity combined with a larger beam waist suppressed density shifts. Enhanced lattice depth modulation consolidated lattice light shift uncertainty to $6.3\times 10^{-19}$ by enabling simultaneous determination of key polarizabilities and magic wavelength. Magnetic shifts were resolved below $10^{-18}$ via precision characterization of the second-order Zeeman coefficient. Supported by a crystalline-coated ultra-low-expansion cavity-stabilized laser and refined temperature control suppressing BBR fluctuations, the clock also achieves a frequency stability better than $1\times10^{-18}$ at 30,000-s averaging time. These developments collectively establish a new benchmark in USTC Sr1 clock performance and pave the way for high-accuracy applications in metrology and fundamental physics.

We propose a scheme for driving a dipolar molecular rotor to rotate continuously by applying an external electric field: the dipolar rotor is fixed on a graphene sheet via a metal atom to facilitate the free rotation; it is in the meantime subjected to an electric field oriented parallel to the graphene sheet. We use computational modeling with density functional theory and Newtonian mechanics, similar to molecular dynamics simulations, to obtain the torque, angular velocity, and rotation period of the rotor. Our results show that the dipolar rotor designed here can rotate with a period of 2.96 ps by an alternating rectangular electric field with a strength of 0.5 V/Å. However, a cosine wave alternating electric field depending on time cannot drive the dipolar rotor to rotate regularly. Therefore, a cosine wave electric field depending on the rotation angle is suggested, as it can not only drive the rotor but also produce additional power. Machine learning molecular dynamics (MLMD) simulations further confirm that the rotor remains thermodynamically stable under an electric field. This work reveals the rotation mechanism of a dipolar molecular rotor in a transverse electric field, and we hope this work can open a new path for designing more diverse molecular machines in experiments.

Using molecular dynamics to investigate the driving force for graphene auto-kirigami

Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph)
Experiments [1] have shown that auto-kirigami structures can grow on the surface of graphene because the graphene-graphene adhesion energy is greater than the graphene-substrate interaction. In this work molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of folded graphene both in vacuum and on a substrate have been performed for a range of different initial geometries and at various temperatures. The final equilibrated configuration for many of these simulations resembles a book with a fold that is at the midpoint of the graphene sheet. We investigate the amount of time it takes to move from an initial folded configuration that does not have the fold at the midpoint of the graphene to this final, book-like configuration. We show that graphene-graphene and graphene substrate-adhesion energies can be extracted from such simulations and that the values obtained are almost always higher than the values of these quantities that are obtained from static calculations. We also show that the rate at which these folded structures grow is affected by differences in these adhesion energies. However, this rate is also affected by factors such as the initial geometry of the graphene that do not change the adhesion energies. Understanding the kinetics of auto-kirigami formation thus requires a description of the system that is more sophisticated than an energy-balance model.

The effects of entropy-patch shape, size, and strength on the upstream acoustic response generated by entropy-patch choked-nozzle interactions are investigated. Numerical-simulation-based investigations, using a two-dimensional planar Euler code, reveal the existence of two distinct modeling regimes: the quasi-steady (matching-condition) regime and the inertial regime, respectively. The ratio of the entropy-patch streamwise length scale to the nozzle throat height was found to be an order parameter, which allows one to determine which of the two modeling regimes applies. Indeed, for entropy patches with a streamwise length scale smaller or equal to the nozzle throat height, the inertial model provides a satisfactory prediction of the upstream acoustic response. For entropy patches with a streamwise length scale larger than the nozzle throat height, the matching condition model has superior predictive accuracy. The entropy patch's shape was judged to have only a slight impact on the applicable modeling regime. Additionally, the study examined entropy-patch strength using the ratio of area-specific perturbation energy to area-specific upstream energy as an order parameter, establishing that both above-mentioned linear models are only valid for weak entropy patches. These findings provide a framework for selecting appropriate models for entropy-patch choked-nozzle interaction scenarios, furthering the fundamental understanding of indirect noise-driven combustion instability.

The forecast of wave variables are important for several applications that depend on a better description of the ocean state. Due to the chaotic behaviour of the differential equations which model this problem, a well know strategy to overcome the difficulties is basically to run several simulations, by for instance, varying the initial condition, and averaging the result of each of these, creating an ensemble. Moreover, in the last few years, considering the amount of available data and the computational power increase, machine learning algorithms have been applied as surrogate to traditional numerical models, yielding comparative or better results. In this work, we present a methodology to create an ensemble of different artificial neural networks architectures, namely, MLP, RNN, LSTM, CNN and a hybrid CNN-LSTM, which aims to predict significant wave height on six different locations in the Brazilian coast. The networks are trained using NOAA's numerical reforecast data and target the residual between observational data and the numerical model output. A new strategy to create the training and target datasets is demonstrated. Results show that our framework is capable of producing high efficient forecast, with an average accuracy of $80\%$, that can achieve up to $88\%$ in the best case scenario, which means $5\%$ reduction in error metrics if compared to NOAA's numerical model, and a increasingly reduction of computational cost.

Flow-driven hysteresis in the transition boiling regime

Subjects:
Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph)
Transition boiling is an intermediate regime occurring between nucleate boiling, where bubbles at the surface efficiently carry heat away, and film boiling, where a layer of vapor formed over the surface insulates the system reducing heat transfer. This regime is inherently unstable and typically occurs near the boiling crisis, where the system approaches the maximum heat flux. Transition boiling hysteresis remains a central open problem in phase-change heat transfer, with critical implications for industrial cooling systems and nuclear reactor safety, since entering this regime sharply reduces heat removal potentially leading to overheating or component damage. We investigate the mechanisms driving hysteresis in the transition boiling regime through large-scale three-dimensional numerical simulations, providing clearcut evidence that hysteresis occurs even under idealized conditions of pool boiling on flat surfaces at constant temperature. This demonstrates that hysteresis arises purely from the flow dynamics of the liquid-vapor system, rather than from surface properties or defects. Moreover, we disclose strong asymmetries in the transition dynamics between nucleate and film boiling. During heating, the transition is abrupt and memory-less, whereas, upon decreasing the surface temperature, it is more complex, with the emergence of metastable coexisting states that can delay the transition.

The reliability of bump connection structures has become a critical aspect of future silicon detectors for particle physics. The High Granularity Timing Detector (HGTD) for the ATLAS experiment at the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider will require 8032 hybrid pixel sensor modules, composed of two Low Gain Avalanche Diode sensors bump-bonded to two readout ASICs and glued to a passive PCB. The detector will operate at low temperature (-30 degrees Celsius) to mitigate the impact of irradiation. The thermomechanical reliability of flip-chip bump connections in HGTD modules is a critical concern, particularly due to their characteristically lower bump density (pixel pitch dimensions of 1.3 mm by 1.3 mm). This paper elaborates on the challenges arising from this design characteristic. Finite element analysis and experimental testing were employed to investigate failure modes in the flip-chip bump structures under thermal cycling from -45 degrees Celsius to 40 degrees Celsius and to guide the module redesign. The optimized design demonstrates significantly enhanced robustness and is projected to fulfill the full lifetime requirements of the HGTD.

Network representations reveal structured uncertainty in music

Music, as a structured yet perceptually rich experience, can be modeled as a network to uncover how humans encode and process auditory information. While network-based representations of music are increasingly common, the impact of feature selection on structural properties and cognitive alignment remains underexplored. In this study, we evaluated eight network models, each constructed from symbolic representations of piano compositions using distinct combinations of pitch, octave, duration, and interval, designed to be representative of existing approaches in the literature. By comparing these models through topological metrics, entropy analysis, and divergence with respect to inferred cognitive representations, we assessed both their structural and perceptual efficiency. Our findings reveal that simpler, feature-specific models better match human perception, whereas complex, multidimensional representations introduce cognitive inefficiencies. These results support the view that humans rely on modular, parallel cognitive networks--an architecture consistent with theories of predictive processing and free energy minimization. Moreover, we find that musical networks are structurally organized to guide attention toward transitions that are both uncertain and inferable. The resulting structure concentrates uncertainty in a few frequently visited nodes, creating local entropy gradients that alternate between stable and unpredictable regions, thereby enabling the expressive dynamics of tension and release that define the musical experience. These findings show that network structures make the organization of uncertainty in music observable, offering new insight into how patterned flows of expectation shape perception, and open new directions for studying how musical structures evolve across genres, cultures, and historical periods through the lens of network science.

We study the ring-opening decomposition of ethylene carbonate in the presence of a single lithium atom and on the surface of lithium metal. Combining accurate electronic structure theory, enhanced sampling, and machine learning, we fine-tune the MACE-MP0 foundation model and apply the resulting machine learning potentials to obtain statistically converged free energy profiles and reaction rates. We confirm that the level of electronic structure theory is important, and inaccurate density functionals can overestimate the reaction rate by up to nine orders of magnitude. We also find that harmonic transition state theory underestimates reaction rates by about one order of magnitude. For the surface reaction, we find and characterize a new, ultrafast decomposition pathway wherein the carbonyl is deeply inserted into the lithium surface and bent by about 70$^\circ$. This reaction, which occurs in a few tens of picoseconds, generates a ring-opened intermediate that is a precursor for CO or CO$_2$ formation; by contrast, an alternative pathway that yields CO$_3^{2-}$ and ethylene is found to be non-competitive, occurring on a timescale of tens of nanoseconds.

We present, motivate, and evaluate Radar Maxima, a calibrated area-based probabilistic forecast product for heavy precipitation. It is designed to overcome inherent limitations of point-based forecasts, which often yield low probabilities for extreme events due to spatial displacement errors. The method aggregates radar-derived precipitation within 40 km neighbourhoods to statistically upscale forecasts from the ensemble system ICON-D2-EPS of DWD. Evaluation considers both objective verification metrics and feedback from operational weather forecasters based on case studies. Verification shows improved predictability, reliability and forecast sharpness. Evaluation of forecasters confirmed operational value in some cases.

We report preliminary results on spherical thermal counterflow generated by a small central heater in an open geometry, an open bath of superfluid He~II, as closed-cell experiments could have introduced artifacts such as overheating and boundary-induced flows. In order to eliminate them, we measure second sound attenuation in a plane-parallel resonator. Our results are at variance with the previous experiments in closed spherical cavity that showed plateau in the steady-state vortex line density and its inverse time decay, neither of which is observed presently. We find that in open geometry the vortex line density $L$ increases steadily with counterflow velocity $v_\mathrm{ns}$, displaying a crossover between $L \propto v_\mathrm{ns}^2$ typical for counterflow and $L \propto v_\mathrm{ns}^{3/2}$, characteristic for the quasi-classical scaling.

A proposal for automated turbulence modelling
Marco Castelletti, Maurizio Quadrio
Subjects:
Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
Solving the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations (RANS) closed with an eddy viscosity computed through a turbulence model is still the leading approach for Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations. Unfortunately, universal models with good predictive capabilities over a wide range of flows are not available.
In this work, we propose the use of machine learning to improve existing RANS models. The approach does not require high-fidelity training data. A convolutional neural network is used to identify and segment at runtime the flow field into different zones, each resembling one item of a predefined list of elementary flows. The turbulence model applied in each zone is taken from an equally predefined set of classic models, each specifically tuned to work best for one elementary flow, free from the requirement of universality.
The idea is first presented in general terms, and then demonstrated via a preliminary implementation, where only three elementary flows are considered, and three turbulence models are used. Test cases show that, already in this oversimplified form, automated zonal modelling outperforms the baseline RANS models without computational overhead.

Subjects:
Applied Physics (physics.app-ph)
Medium-deep geothermal energy is a key renewable source, but existing coaxial downhole heat exchanger (DHE) systems suffer from low efficiency and temperature decay. This study evaluates the impacts of circulating flow rate, inlet temperature, and operation mode on DHE performance, using field data from two geothermal wells (Well A: 3200m, 130.5$^{\circ}$C; Well B: 2500m, 103.3$^{\circ}$C). Results show that under an optimal condition (LC3: 50 m$^3$/h, 30$^{\circ}$C), Well A's heat extraction rate increased from 35% to 42%, with its outlet temperature rising from 15$^{\circ}$C to 20$^{\circ}$C. In contrast, Well B's rate decreased from 15% to 5%. After one week of continuous operation, the outlet temperature of Well A dropped from 55.7$^{\circ}$C to 16.5$^{\circ}$C, and Well B's from 68$^{\circ}$C to 17$^{\circ}$C. Adopting an intermittent mode (16h operation, 8h shutdown daily) reduced the temperature decay rate by approximately 10%. Based on these findings, we propose optimization strategies: controlling flow rate to 35m$^3$/h, maintaining an inlet temperature of 6--10$^{\circ}$C, and implementing intermittent scheduling. This work provides guidance for the efficient design and sustainable operation of DHE systems.

Resolving the Body-Order Paradox of Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials

Subjects:
Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph)
In many cases, the predictions of machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) can be interpreted as a sum of body-ordered contributions, which is explicit when the model is directly built on neighbor density correlation descriptors, and implicit when the model captures the correlations through non-linear functions of low body-order terms. In both cases, the "effective body-orderedness" of MLIPs remains largely unexplained: how do the models decompose the total energy into body-ordered contributions, and how does their body-orderedness affect the accuracy and learning behavior? In answering these questions, we first discuss the complexities in imposing the many-body expansion on ab initio calculations at the atomic limit. Next, we train a curated set of MLIPs on datasets of hydrogen clusters and reveal the inherent tendency of the ML models to deduce their own, effective body-order trends, which are dependent on the model type and dataset makeup. Finally, we present different trends in the convergence of the body-orders and generalizability of the models, providing useful insights for the development of future MLIPs.

In this work, we present frozen natural orbital (FNO) based implementations of equation-of-motion (EOM) coupled-cluster (CC) with singles, doubles, and triples (SDT) for ionization potential (IP), double ionization potential (DIP), electron attachment (EA), and double electron attachment (DEA) variants. For EOM-CC with singles and doubles (SD), the FNO approach has already been studied by Krylov and co-workers for IP variant and for spin-flipping and spin-conserving excited states (respectively, the SF and EE variants) for both total energies and energy-gaps. Recently, we presented FNO-CCSDT performance for ground state energies of molecules, triplet-singlet gaps and for numerical estimation force constants of some diatomic molecules. Now we present our study on performance of IP, DIP, EA and DEA variants of FNO-EOM-CCSDT in computing total-energies, and for target-reference and target-target energy-gaps. Following earlier studies by us and by Krylov and co-workers, we also present the XFNO-EOM-CCSDT approach for these variants and examine its performance for total energies and energy-gaps.

An Attention-Based Stochastic Simulator for Multisite Extremes to Evaluate Nonstationary, Cascading Flood Risk

Geophysics (physics.geo-ph); Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics (physics.ao-ph); Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability (physics.data-an)
Compound flood risks from spatially and temporally clustered extremes challenge traditional risk models and insurance portfolios that often neglect correlated risks across regions. Spatiotemporally clustered floods exhibit fat-tail behavior, modulated by low-frequency hydroclimatic variability and large-scale moisture transport. Nonstationary stochastic simulators and regional compound event models aim to capture such tail risk, but have not yet unified spatial and temporal extremes under low-frequency hydroclimatic variability. We introduce a novel attention-based framework for multisite flood generation conditional on a multivariate hydroclimatic signal with explainable attribution to global sub-decadal to multi-decadal climate variability. Our simulator combines wavelet signal processing, transformer-based multivariate time series forecasting, and modified Neyman-Scott joint clustering to simulate climate-informed spatially compounding and temporally cascading floods. Applied to a Mississippi River Basin case study, the model generates distributed portfolios of plausibly clustered flood risks across space and time, providing a basis for simulating spatiotemporally correlated losses characteristic of flood-induced damage.

The experience is structured into three interactive stations, each focusing on a specific messenger and its detection method. Small teams of visitors will collaborate to solve puzzles and quizzes related to gamma-ray observations, neutrino detection, and cosmic-ray composition. Using a combination of audio, video, and written materials, participants will engage with real scientific concepts while working together to "escape." The ultimate goal is to spark curiosity, teamwork, and excitement for science, making astroparticle physics more accessible and engaging.

Teachers that teach the irrelevant: Pre-training machine learned interaction potentials with classical force fields for robust molecular dynamics simulations

Subjects:
Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph)
Machine learned interaction potentials (MLIPs) have become a critical component of large-scale, high-quality simulations for a range of chemical and biochemical systems. Yet, despite their in-distribution accuracy, molecular dynamics simulations using MLIPs exhibit numerical instabilities due to underlying data insufficiencies when encountering new regions of the potential energy surface. Here we propose a pre-training learning scheme that uses low-quality, practically free, single-molecule non-reactive force field data while all intermolecular interactions and reactive properties are learned at a fine-tuning stage with a small amount of computationally more expensive labels. We show that the force field pre-training approach followed by data efficient ab initio fine tuning allows for stable and accurate molecular dynamics and metadynamics simulations of gas phase molecules, liquid water, and hydrogen combustion reactions compared to models trained from scratch.

The energy of a bunched non-relativistic ion beam can be deduced from measuring the beam phases in neighbouring Beam Position Monitors (BPMs). This report discusses implementation of such a procedure at the PIP-II H- linac being constructed at Fermilab. The case when the flight time between BPMs is longer than the period of BPM frequency is considered in more detail. When absolute BPM phase calibration is not available, the BPM phase information can be used to track deviations of the beam energy from the de-sired value. Such "energy deviation" parameter is operationally implemented at the transfer line between 400 MeV Linac and the Booster, and its analog is expected to be used in the transfer line from PIP-II as well.

Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Optics (physics.optics)
Controlling the motion of nanoscale objects at the quantum limit promises new tests of quantum mechanics and advanced sensors. Rotational motion is of particular interest, as it follows nonlinear dynamics in a compact, closed configuration space, which opens up a plethora of phenomena and applications beyond the possibilities of free or trapped linear motion. A prerequisite for such experiments is the capability to trap nanorotors and initialize them in a quantum ground state of libration. Here, we demonstrate the reliable, repetitive laser-induced loading of silica nanodimers and trimers into an optical tweezer. Coherent scattering in a high-finesse cavity allows us to cool two different librational modes to the quantum ground state with occupation numbers as low as $n_{\beta}=0.54\pm0.32$ and $n_{\alpha}=0.21\pm0.03$. By simultaneously cooling both degrees of freedom ($n_\beta=0.73\pm0.22$, $n_\alpha=1.02\pm0.08$) we align nanorotors to a space-fixed axis with precision better than 20$\,\mu$rad, close to the zero-point amplitude of librations.

We study how coherent scattering of a background gas off an atom (or other matter) interferometer can lead to enhanced signals from phase shifts and contrast loss. We focus on the inclusion of realistic features of atom interferometers such as finite temperature, cloud substructure, and time-dependent cloud radii. The inclusion of these effects, extending beyond the previously considered point-like cloud approximation, naturally allow us to study the smooth transition between the coherent and incoherent scattering regimes. We discuss how the formalism presented herein can be tested in the lab (with near-infrared photons or an eV-scale electron gun), and discuss an application for the detection of dark matter interacting via long-range forces.

Machine Learning (cs.LG); Applied Physics (physics.app-ph)
Ecological systems exhibit complex multi-scale dynamics that challenge traditional modeling. New methods must capture temporal oscillations and emergent spatiotemporal patterns while adhering to conservation principles. We present the Unified Spatiotemporal Physics-Informed Learning (USPIL) framework, a deep learning architecture integrating physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and conservation laws to model predator-prey dynamics across dimensional scales. The framework provides a unified solution for both ordinary (ODE) and partial (PDE) differential equation systems, describing temporal cycles and reaction-diffusion patterns within a single neural network architecture. Our methodology uses automatic differentiation to enforce physics constraints and adaptive loss weighting to balance data fidelity with physical consistency. Applied to the Lotka-Volterra system, USPIL achieves 98.9% correlation for 1D temporal dynamics (loss: 0.0219, MAE: 0.0184) and captures complex spiral waves in 2D systems (loss: 4.7656, pattern correlation: 0.94). Validation confirms conservation law adherence within 0.5% and shows a 10-50x computational speedup for inference compared to numerical solvers. USPIL also enables mechanistic understanding through interpretable physics constraints, facilitating parameter discovery and sensitivity analysis not possible with purely data-driven methods. Its ability to transition between dimensional formulations opens new avenues for multi-scale ecological modeling. These capabilities make USPIL a transformative tool for ecological forecasting, conservation planning, and understanding ecosystem resilience, establishing physics-informed deep learning as a powerful and scientifically rigorous paradigm.

We demonstrate that thermally stable perpendicular magnetic tunnel junctions (pMTJs), widely used in spin-transfer torque magnetic random-access memory, can be actuated with nanosecond pulses to exhibit tunable stochastic behavior. This actuated-stochastic tunnel junction (A-sMTJ) concept produces random telegraph noise, with control over fluctuation rate and probability bias. The device response is shown to be consistent with a Poisson process, with fluctuation rates tunable over more than two orders of magnitude, with average state dwell times varying from 29 ns to greater than 2.3 microseconds. These results establish A-sMTJs as a versatile platform for integrating deterministic, stochastic, and in-memory functionality on a single chip, advancing the development of probabilistic, neuromorphic, and unconventional computing systems.

We review two magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) approaches for compact, low-power, CMOS-integrated true random number generation (TRNG). The first employs passive-read, easy-plane superparamagnetic MTJs (sMTJs) that generate thermal-fluctuation-driven bit streams at $0.5$--$1$~Gb/s per device. The second uses MTJs with magnetically stable free layers, operated with stochastic write pulses to achieve switching probabilities of about $0.5$ (\emph{i.e.}, write error rates of $\simeq 0.5$), achieving $\gtrsim 0.1$~Gb/s per device; we refer to these as stochastic-write MTJs (SW-MTJs). Randomness from both approaches has been validated using the NIST~SP800 test suites. The sMTJ approach uses a read-only cell with low power and can be compatible with most advanced CMOS nodes, while SW-MTJs leverage standard CMOS MTJ process flows, enabling co-integration with embedded spin-transfer torque magnetic random access memory (STT-MRAM). Both approaches can achieve deep sub-0.01~$\mu$m$^2$ MTJ footprints and offer orders-of-magnitude better energy efficiency than CPU/GPU-based generators, enabling placement near logic for high-throughput random bit-streams for probabilistic computing, statistical modeling, and cryptography. In terms of performance, sMTJs generally suit applications requiring very high data-rate random bits near logic processors, such as probabilistic computing or large-scale statistical modeling. By contrast, SW-MTJs are an attractive option for edge-oriented microcontrollers, providing entropy sources for computing or cryptographic enhancement. We highlight the strengths, limitations, and integration challenges of each approach, emphasizing the need to reduce device-to-device variability in sMTJs -- particularly by mitigating magnetostriction-induced in-plane anisotropy -- and to improve temporal stability in SW-MTJs for robust, large-scale deployment.

The effect of parameter drift in the transport of magnetized plasma particles

Subjects:

We investigate how time dependent modulations of drift wave amplitudes affect particle transport and chaos in a magnetized plasma. Using the Horton model, we apply a sawtooth ramp to a primary wave's amplitude and periodic rectangular kicks to secondary waves, simulating a driven system. Particle transport is quantified by the Mean Square Displacement (MSD) exponent, $\alpha$, and chaos by the Maximum Lyapunov Exponent (MLE). Our primary finding is a strong negative correlation between the system's average chaoticity and its transport efficiency. We show that rapid sawtooth ramping (short period $\tau$) produces highly efficient, superdiffusive transport ($\alpha > 1$). In contrast, slower ramping increases the system's chaos but suppresses transport, driving it towards normal diffusion ($\alpha \to 1$). This counter intuitive result demonstrates that heightened chaos destroys the coherent, streamer like structures necessary for superdiffusive flights. Our findings indicate that the coherence of the turbulent field, rather than its raw chaoticity, is the key determinant of transport efficiency, offering a new perspective on plasma control.

The growing need for structural materials with strength, mechanical stability, and durability in extreme environments is driving the development of high entropy alloys. These are materials with near equiatomic mixing of five or more principal elements, and such compositional complexity often leads to improvements in mechanical properties and high thermal stability, etc. Thus, high-entropy alloys have found their applications in domains like aerospace, biomedical, energy storage, catalysis, electronics, etc. However, the vast compositional design and experimental exploration of high-entropy alloys are both time consuming and expensive and require a large number of resources. Machine learning techniques have thus become essential for accelerating high entropy alloys discovery using data driven predictions of promising alloy combinations and their properties. Hence, this work employs a machine learning framework that predicts high entropy alloy hardness from elemental descriptors such as atomic radius, valence electron count, bond strength, etc. Machine learning regression models, like LightGBM, Gradient Boosting Regressor, and Transformer encoder, were trained on experimental data. Additionally, a language model was also fine tuned to predict hardness from elemental descriptor strings. The results indicate that LightGBM has better accuracy in predicting the hardness of high entropy alloys compared to other models used in this study. Further, a combinatorial technique was used to generate over 9 million virtual high entropy alloy candidates, and the trained machine learning models were used to predict their hardness. This study shows how machine learning-driven high throughput screening and language modelling approaches can accelerate the development of next generation high entropy alloys.

Chemists in search of structure-property relationships face great challenges due to limited high quality, concordant datasets. Machine learning (ML) has significantly advanced predictive capabilities in chemical sciences, but these modern data-driven approaches have increased the demand for data. In response to the growing demand for explainable AI (XAI) and to bridge the gap between predictive accuracy and human comprehensibility, we introduce LAMeL - a Linear Algorithm for Meta-Learning that preserves interpretability while improving the prediction accuracy across multiple properties. While most approaches treat each chemical prediction task in isolation, LAMeL leverages a meta-learning framework to identify shared model parameters across related tasks, even if those tasks do not share data, allowing it to learn a common functional manifold that serves as a more informed starting point for new unseen tasks. Our method delivers performance improvements ranging from 1.1- to 25-fold over standard ridge regression, depending on the domain of the dataset. While the degree of performance enhancement varies across tasks, LAMeL consistently outperforms or matches traditional linear methods, making it a reliable tool for chemical property prediction where both accuracy and interpretability are critical.

Altermagnets have recently been recognized as a distinct class of magnetic materials characterized by alternative spin-split electronic structures without net magnetization. Despite intensive studies on their single-particle spintronic and valleytronic properties, many-electron interactions and optical responses of altermagnets remain less explored. In this work, we employ many-body perturbation theory to investigate excited states and their strain tunability. Using monolayer Mn2WS4 as a representative candidate, we uncover a novel spin valley-dependent excitonic selection rule in two-dimensional altermagnetic Lieb lattices. In addition to strongly bound excitons, we find that linearly polarized light selectively excites valley spin-polarized excitons. Moreover, due to the interplay between altermagnetic spin symmetry and electronic orbital character, we predict that applying uniaxial strain can lift valley degeneracy and enable the selective excitation of spin-polarized excitons, an effect not achievable in previously studied transition-metal dichalcogenides. These spin-valley-locked excitonic states and their strain tunability offer a robust mechanism for four-fold symmetric altermagnets to encode, store, and read valley/spin information.

We predict a so-called axial Hall effect, a Berry-curvature-driven anomalous Hall response, in Lieb-lattice altermagnets. By constructing a tight-binding model, we identify the axial direction as a hidden topological degree of freedom. Breaking the double degeneracy of axial symmetry generates substantial Berry curvature and induces a pronounced anomalous Hall conductivity. First-principles calculations further confirm the emergence of this effect in strained altermagnets, particularly in ternary transition-metal dichalcogenides. We take Mn2WS4 as an example to reveal that the axial Hall effect originates from the interplay between Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling and the intrinsic piezomagnetic response of Lieb-lattice altermagnets, leading to highly localized and enhanced Berry curvature. Remarkably, the magnitude of the axial Hall effect is significant and remains unchanged when varying the strain, highlighting the topological nature of the axial degree of freedom. Finally, in multilayer systems, the effect manifests as a distinctive thickness-dependent modulation of both anomalous and spin Hall responses. These findings emphasize the critical role of spin-orbit coupling and noncollinear spin textures in altermagnets, an area that has received limited attention, and open new pathways for exploring intrinsic Hall phenomena in topological magnetic systems.

Research linking surface hydrides to Q-disease, and the subsequent development of methods to eliminate surface hydrides, is one of the great successes of SRF cavity R&D. We use time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau to extend the theory of hydride dissipation to sub-surface hydrides. Just as surface hydrides cause Q-disease behavior, we show that sub-surface hydrides cause high-field Q-slope (HFQS) behavior. We find that the abrupt onset of HFQS is due to a transition from a vortex-free state to a vortex-penetration state. We show that controlling hydride size and depth through impurity doping can eliminate HFQS.

This paper presents the modeling and verification of multibody structural dynamics for offshore wind turbines. The flexible tower and support structure of a monopile-based offshore wind turbine are modeled using an acausal, lumped-parameter, multibody approach that incorporates structural flexibility, soil-structure interaction, and hydrodynamic models. Simulation results are benchmarked against alternative modeling approaches, demonstrating the model's ability to accurately capture both static and dynamic behaviors under various wind and wave conditions while maintaining computational efficiency. This work provides a valuable tool for analyzing key structural characteristics of wind turbines, including eigenfrequencies, mode shapes, damping, and internal forces.

The increasing volume and complexity of X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) data generated at synchrotron facilities worldwide require robust infrastructure for data management, sharing, and analysis. This paper introduces the XAS Database (XASDB), a comprehensive web-based platform developed and hosted by the Canadian Light Source (CLS). The database houses more than 1000 reference spectra spanning 40 elements and 324 chemical compounds. The platform employs a this http URL architecture designed to handle diverse data formats from multiple beamlines and synchrotron facilities. A key innovation is the XASproc JavaScript library, which enables browser-based XAS data processing including normalization, background sub- traction, extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) extraction, and preliminary analysis traditionally limited to desktop applications. The integrated XASVue spectral viewer provides installation-free data visualization and analysis with broad accessibility across devices and operating systems. By offering standardized data output, comprehensive metadata, and integrated analytical ca- pabilities, XASDB facilitates collaborative research and promotes FAIR (Findable, Accessible, In- teroperable, and Reusable) data principles. The platform serves as a valuable resource for linear combination fitting (LCF) analysis, machine learning applications, and educational purposes. This initiative demonstrates the potential for web-centric approaches in XAS data analysis, accelerating advances in materials science, environmental research, chemistry, and biology.

This work explores the morphology and dynamical properties of cores within rich superclusters, highlighting their role as transitional structures in the large-scale structure of the Universe. Using projected and radial velocity distributions of member galaxies, we identify cores as dense structures that, despite being gravitationally bound, are not yet dynamically relaxed. However, they exhibit a tendency toward virialisation, evolving in a self-similar manner to massive galaxy clusters but on a larger scale. Morphological analysis reveals that cores are predominantly filamentary, reflecting quasi-linear formation processes consistent with the Zeldovich approximation. Our estimates of the entropy confirm their intermediate dynamical state, with relaxation levels varying across the sample. Mass estimates indicate efficient accretion processes, concentrating matter into gravitationally bound systems. We conclude that cores are important environments where galaxy evolution and hierarchical assembly occur, bridging the gap between supercluster-scale structures and virialised clusters.

Thermal Degradation Mechanisms and Stability Enhancement Strategies in Perovskite Solar Cells: A Review

Perovskite Solar Cells (PSCs) have garnered global research interest owing to their superior photovoltaic (PV) performance. The future of photovoltaic technology lies in PSCs since they can produce power with performance on par with the best silicon solar cells while being less expensive. PSCs have enormous potential; in just ten years, their efficiency increased from 3.8% to 25.2%, and research into new developments is still ongoing. Thermal instability is PSCs' main disadvantage, despite their high efficiency, flexibility, and lightweight nature. This paper looks at how temperature affects the ways that hole transport layers (HTLs) like spiro-OMeTAD and perovskite layers, especially MAPbI3, degrade. Elevated temperatures cause MAPbI3 to degrade into PbI2, CH3I, and NH3, with decomposition rates affected by moisture, oxygen, and environmental factors. Mixed cation compositions, such as Cs-MA-FA, have higher thermal stability, whereas MA+ cations break-down faster under heat stress. HTLs deteriorate due to morphological changes and the hydrophilicity of dopant additions like Li-TFSI and t-BP. Alternative dopant-free HTMs, such as P3HT and inorganic materials including CuSCN, NiOx, and Cu2O, have shown improved thermal stability and efficiency. Hybrid HTLs, dopant-free designs, and interface tweaks are all viable solutions for increasing the stability of PSC. Addressing thermal stability issues remains crucial for the development of more reliable and efficient PSC technology.

Compared with Hermitian theory, non-Hermitian physics offers a fundamentally different mathematical framework, enabling the observation of topological phenomena that have no analogue in Hermitian systems. Among these, the exceptional point (EP) ring stands out as a quintessential topological feature unique to non-Hermitian systems. In this study, we employ single-photon interferometry to overcome the experimental challenge of precise phase control in quantum systems, thereby enabling a complete simulation of the non-Hermitian EP ring in three-dimensional parameter space without invoking any additional symmetry assumptions. By measuring the non-Hermitian dynamics in three-dimensional parameter space, we determine the system's eigenstates, which allows us to characterize the topological band structure of the system under different conditions. We describe the topological properties of the EP ring by extracting the Chern number and Berry phase for different parameter manifolds and observe the topological critical phenomena of the system. Our work paves the way for further exploration of topological non-Hermitian systems.

Inductively heated metamaterial reactors, which utilize an open cell lattice baffle structure as a heating susceptor for magnetic induction, are promising candidates for scaled electrified thermochemical reactor operation due to their ability to support volumetric heating profiles and enhanced heat transfer properties. In this work, we present a systematic scale up analysis of inductive metamaterial reactors where we utilize a combination of analytic modeling, numerical simulations, and experiments to project the capabilities and performance of scaled reactors. We use reverse water gas shift as a model reaction system and show that for reactor configurations featuring a uniform metamaterial susceptor, the total system efficiency increases with scale. However, the throughput of these scaled reactors is limited by radial temperature gradients. We further show this bottleneck can be overcome by tailoring the radial effective conductivity profile of the susceptor, which can enable scaled reactors with nearly ideal plug flow-like capabilities. These concepts provide a pathway towards scaled electrified thermochemical reactors with optimal chemical conversion capabilities.

Pathways to Elastic Turbulence in Giant Micelles Through Curvature Ratios in Taylor-Couette Flow

Subjects:

In the past fifteen years, flow instabilities reminiscent of the Taylor-like instabilities driven by hoop stresses, have been observed in wormlike micelles based on surfactant molecules. In particular, purely elastic instabilities and turbulence have been shown to develop on top of shear banding, a type of flow specific to the semi-dilute and concentrated regimes. These instabilities have been identified as the origin of the large body of data showing complex spatio-temporal fluctuations, collected in shear-banded systems using multiple experimental techniques. Different categories of banding have been suggested depending on their stability, which involve intrinsic properties of the system and streamline curvature. It has been shown qualitatively that instabilities are promoted by an increase of the surfactant concentration or of the curvature of the flow geometry, while an increase in temperature stabilizes the flow. Here, using benchmark shear banding micellar systems, we quantify, for the first time, the effect of the streamline curvature on these flow instabilities, focusing more specifically on the transition towards purely elastic turbulence. Using various optical visualizations, we identify two transitional pathways to elastic turbulence. We construct a generic state diagram in a parameter space based on the curvature ratio and the Weissenberg number. The nature --supercritical \textit{vs} subcritical-- of the transition to elastic turbulence is discussed. The stress evolution is in favor of a change of nature from subcritical to supercritical transition as the curvature ratio increases. However we show that finite size effects cannot be neglected and may smooth artificially the stress response. Furthermore, each domain of this diagram is characterized using velocimetry measurements. Finally a scaling for the onset of elastic turbulence is determined.

Group-VI transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), MoS$_2$ and MoSe$_2$, have emerged as prototypical low-dimensional systems with distinctive phononic and electronic properties, making them attractive for applications in nanoelectronics, optoelectronics, and thermoelectrics. Yet, their reported lattice thermal conductivities ($\kappa$) remain highly inconsistent, with experimental values and theoretical predictions differing by more than an order of magnitude. These discrepancies stem from uncertainties in measurement techniques, variations in computational protocols, and ambiguities in the treatment of higher-order anharmonic processes. In this study, we critically review these inconsistencies, first by mapping the spread of experimental and modeling results, and then by identifying the methodological origins of divergence. To this end, we bridge first-principles calculations, molecular dynamics simulations, and state-of-the-art machine learning force fields (MLFFs) including recently developed foundation models. %MACE-OMAT-0, UMA, and NEP89. We train and benchmark GAP, MACE, NEP, and \textsc{HIPHIVE} against density functional theory (DFT) and rigorously evaluate the impact of third- and fourth-order phonon scattering processes on $\kappa$. The computational efficiency of MLFFs enables us to extend convergence tests beyond conventional limits and to validate predictions through homogeneous nonequilibrium molecular dynamics as well. Our analysis demonstrates that, contrary to some recent claims, fully converged four-phonon processes contribute negligibly to the intrinsic thermal conductivity of both MoS$_2$ and MoSe$_2$. These findings not only refine the intrinsic transport limits of 2D TMDs but also establish MLFF-based approaches as a robust and scalable framework for predictive modeling of phonon-mediated thermal transport in low-dimensional materials.

An End-to-End Differentiable, Graph Neural Network-Embedded Pore Network Model for Permeability Prediction

Machine Learning (cs.LG); Geophysics (physics.geo-ph)
Accurate prediction of permeability in porous media is essential for modeling subsurface flow. While pure data-driven models offer computational efficiency, they often lack generalization across scales and do not incorporate explicit physical constraints. Pore network models (PNMs), on the other hand, are physics-based and efficient but rely on idealized geometric assumptions to estimate pore-scale hydraulic conductance, limiting their accuracy in complex structures. To overcome these limitations, we present an end-to-end differentiable hybrid framework that embeds a graph neural network (GNN) into a PNM. In this framework, the analytical formulas used for conductance calculations are replaced by GNN-based predictions derived from pore and throat features. The predicted conductances are then passed to the PNM solver for permeability computation. In this way, the model avoids the idealized geometric assumptions of PNM while preserving the physics-based flow calculations. The GNN is trained without requiring labeled conductance data, which can number in the thousands per pore network; instead, it learns conductance values by using a single scalar permeability as the training target. This is made possible by backpropagating gradients through both the GNN (via automatic differentiation) and the PNM solver (via a discrete adjoint method), enabling fully coupled, end-to-end training. The resulting model achieves high accuracy and generalizes well across different scales, outperforming both pure data-driven and traditional PNM approaches. Gradient-based sensitivity analysis further reveals physically consistent feature influences, enhancing model interpretability. This approach offers a scalable and physically informed framework for permeability prediction in complex porous media, reducing model uncertainty and improving accuracy.

We implement and experimentally demonstrate a 60 GHz distributed system leveraging an optical time synchronization system that provides precise time and frequency alignment between independent elements of the distributed mesh. Utilizing such accurate coherence, we perform receive beamforming with interference rejection and transmit nulling. In these configurations, the system achieves a coherent gain over an incoherent network of N nodes, significantly improving the relevant signal power ratios. Our system demonstrates extended array phase coherence times, enabling advanced techniques. Results from over-the-air experiments demonstrate a 14.3 dB signal-to-interference-plus-noise improvement in interference-laden scenarios with a contributing 13.5 dB null towards interference in receive beamforming. In transmit nulling, a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gain of 7.9 dB is measured towards an intended receiver while maintaining an SNR reduction of 8.9 dB at another receiver. These findings represent the use of distributed coherence in the V band without the use of GPS timing.

A device capable of performing real time classification of proteins in a clinical setting would allow for inexpensive and rapid disease diagnosis. One such candidate for this technology are nanopore devices. These devices work by measuring a current signal that arises when a protein or peptide enters a nanometer-length-scale pore. Should this current be uniquely related to the structure of the peptide and its interactions with the pore, the signals can be used to perform identification. While such a method would allow for real time identification of peptides and proteins in a clinical setting, to date, the complexities of these signals limit their accuracy. In this work, we tackle the issue of classification by converting the current signals into scaleogram images via wavelet transforms, capturing amplitude, frequency, and time information in a modality well-suited to machine learning algorithms. When tested on 42 peptides, our method achieved a classification accuracy of ~$81\,\%$, setting a new state-of-the-art in the field and taking a step toward practical peptide/protein diagnostics at the point of care. In addition, we demonstrate model transfer techniques that will be critical when deploying these models into real hardware, paving the way to a new method for real-time disease diagnosis.

Whether singularities can form in fluids remains a foundational unanswered question in mathematics. This phenomenon occurs when solutions to governing equations, such as the 3D Euler equations, develop infinite gradients from smooth initial conditions. Historically, numerical approaches have primarily identified stable singularities. However, these are not expected to exist for key open problems, such as the boundary-free Euler and Navier-Stokes cases, where unstable singularities are hypothesized to play a crucial role. Here, we present the first systematic discovery of new families of unstable singularities. A stable singularity is a robust outcome, forming even if the initial state is slightly perturbed. In contrast, unstable singularities are exceptionally elusive; they require initial conditions tuned with infinite precision, being in a state of instability whereby infinitesimal perturbations immediately divert the solution from its blow-up trajectory. In particular, we present multiple new, unstable self-similar solutions for the incompressible porous media equation and the 3D Euler equation with boundary, revealing a simple empirical asymptotic formula relating the blow-up rate to the order of instability. Our approach combines curated machine learning architectures and training schemes with a high-precision Gauss-Newton optimizer, achieving accuracies that significantly surpass previous work across all discovered solutions. For specific solutions, we reach near double-float machine precision, attaining a level of accuracy constrained only by the round-off errors of the GPU hardware. This level of precision meets the requirements for rigorous mathematical validation via computer-assisted proofs. This work provides a new playbook for exploring the complex landscape of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) and tackling long-standing challenges in mathematical physics.

This article deals with the characterization and detection of community and faction structures in signed networks. We approach the study of these mesoscale structures through the lens of the Gremban expansion. This graph operation lifts a signed graph to a larger unsigned graph, and allows the extension of standard techniques from unsigned to signed graphs. We develop the combinatorial and algebraic properties of the Gremban expansion, with a focus on its inherent involutive symmetry. The main technical result is a bijective correspondence between symmetry-respecting cut-sets in the Gremban expansion, and regular cut-sets and frustration sets in the signed graph (i.e., the combinatorial structures that underlie communities and factions respectively). This result forms the basis for our new approach to community-faction detection in signed networks, which makes use of spectral clustering techniques that naturally respect the required symmetries. We demonstrate how this approach distinguishes the two mesoscale structures, how to generalize the approach to multi-way clustering and discuss connections to network dynamical systems.

Residual-based adaptive strategies are widely used in scientific machine learning but remain largely heuristic. We introduce a unifying variational framework that formalizes these methods by integrating convex transformations of the residual. Different transformations correspond to distinct objective functionals: exponential weights target the minimization of uniform error, while linear weights recover the minimization of quadratic error. Within this perspective, adaptive weighting is equivalent to selecting sampling distributions that optimize the primal objective, thereby linking discretization choices directly to error metrics. This principled approach yields three benefits: (1) it enables systematic design of adaptive schemes across norms, (2) reduces discretization error through variance reduction of the loss estimator, and (3) enhances learning dynamics by improving the gradient signal-to-noise ratio. Extending the framework to operator learning, we demonstrate substantial performance gains across optimizers and architectures. Our results provide a theoretical justification of residual-based adaptivity and establish a foundation for principled discretization and training strategies.

We establish a large deviation principle (LDP) for probability graphons, which are symmetric functions from the unit square into the space of probability measures. This notion extends classical graphons and provides a flexible framework for studying the limit behavior of large dense weighted graphs. In particular, our result generalizes the seminal work of Chatterjee and Varadhan (2011), who derived an LDP for Erdős-Rényi random graphs via graphon theory. We move beyond their binary (Bernoulli) setting to encompass arbitrary edge-weight distributions. Specifically, we analyze the distribution on probability graphons induced by random weighted graphs in which edges are sampled independently from a common reference probability measure supported on a compact Polish space. We prove that this distribution satisfies an LDP with a good rate function, expressed as an extension of the Kullback-Leibler divergence between probability graphons and the reference measure. This theorem can also be viewed as a Sanov-type result in the graphon setting. Our work provides a rigorous foundation for analyzing rare events in weighted networks and supports statistical inference in structured random graph models under distributional edge uncertainty.

Data Denoising and Derivative Estimation for Data-Driven Modeling of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems

Machine Learning (cs.LG); Dynamical Systems (math.DS); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph)
Data-driven modeling of nonlinear dynamical systems is often hampered by measurement noise. We propose a denoising framework, called Runge-Kutta and Total Variation Based Implicit Neural Representation (RKTV-INR), that represents the state trajectory with an implicit neural representation (INR) fitted directly to noisy observations. Runge-Kutta integration and total variation are imposed as constraints to ensure that the reconstructed state is a trajectory of a dynamical system that remains close to the original data. The trained INR yields a clean, continuous trajectory and provides accurate first-order derivatives via automatic differentiation. These denoised states and derivatives are then supplied to Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) to recover the governing equations. Experiments demonstrate effective noise suppression, precise derivative estimation, and reliable system identification.

The key observation about quantum reality is that it often appears as if, at some moment, the probability of a quantum event becomes a definite outcome for us. A careful analysis suggests, however, that what we perceive as a definite state -- the observed outcome of a quantum experiment -- is not strictly definite. From this, we conclude that the quantum world is active: its influence extends beyond a merely statistical and permanently fixed determination of reality as we experience it.

It is well known that animals can use neural and sensory feedback via vision, tactile sensing, and echolocation to negotiate obstacles. Similarly, most robots use deliberate or reactive planning to avoid obstacles, which relies on prior knowledge or high-fidelity sensing of the environment. However, during dynamic locomotion in complex, novel, 3-D terrains such as forest floor and building rubble, sensing and planning suffer bandwidth limitation and large noise and are sometimes even impossible. Here, we study rapid locomotion over a large gap, a simple, ubiquitous obstacle, to begin to discover general principles of dynamic traversal of large 3-D obstacles. We challenged the discoid cockroach and an open-loop six-legged robot to traverse a large gap of varying length. Both the animal and the robot could dynamically traverse a gap as large as 1 body length by bridging the gap with its head, but traversal probability decreased with gap length. Based on these observations, we developed a template that well captured body dynamics and quantitatively predicted traversal performance. Our template revealed that high approach speed, initial body pitch, and initial body pitch angular velocity facilitated dynamic traversal, and successfully predicted a new strategy of using body pitch control that increased the robot maximal traversal gap length by 50%. Our study established the first template of dynamic locomotion beyond planar surfaces and is an important step in expanding terradynamics into complex 3-D terrains.

Body-terrain interaction affects large bump traversal of insects and legged robots

Small animals and robots must often rapidly traverse large bump-like obstacles when moving through complex 3-D terrains, during which, in addition to leg-ground contact, their body inevitably comes into physical contact with the obstacles. However, we know little about the performance limits of large bump traversal and how body-terrain interaction affects traversal. To address these, we challenged the discoid cockroach and an open-loop six-legged robot to dynamically run into a large bump of varying height to discover the maximal traversal performance, and studied how locomotor modes and traversal performance are affected by body-terrain interaction. Remarkably, during rapid running, both the animal and the robot were capable of dynamically traversing a bump much higher than its hip height (up to 4 times the hip height for the animal and 3 times for the robot, respectively) at traversal speeds typical of running, with decreasing traversal probability with increasing bump height. A stability analysis using a novel locomotion energy landscape model explained why traversal was more likely when the animal or robot approached the bump with a low initial body yaw and a high initial body pitch, and why deflection was more likely otherwise. Inspired by these principles, we demonstrated a novel control strategy of active body pitching that increased the robot maximal traversable bump height by 75%. Our study is a major step in establishing the framework of locomotion energy landscapes to understand locomotion in complex 3-D terrains.

Robotic modeling of snake traversing large, smooth obstacles reveals stability benefits of body compliance

Snakes can move through almost any terrain. Although their locomotion on flat surfaces using planar gaits is inherently stable, when snakes deform their body out of plane to traverse complex terrain, maintaining stability becomes a challenge. On trees and desert dunes, snakes grip branches or brace against depressed sand for stability. However, how they stably surmount obstacles like boulders too large and smooth to gain such anchor points is less understood. Similarly, snake robots are challenged to stably traverse large, smooth obstacles for search and rescue and building inspection. Our recent study discovered that snakes combine body lateral undulation and cantilevering to stably traverse large steps. Here, we developed a snake robot with this gait and snake-like anisotropic friction and used it as a physical model to understand stability principles. The robot traversed steps as high as a third of its body length rapidly and stably. However, on higher steps, it was more likely to fail due to more frequent rolling and flipping over, which was absent in the snake with a compliant body. Adding body compliance reduced the robot roll instability by statistically improving surface contact, without reducing speed. Besides advancing understanding of snake locomotion, our robot achieved high traversal speed surpassing most previous snake robots and approaching snakes, while maintaining high traversal probability.

We examine the circular, self-similar expansion of frictional rupture due to fluid injected at a constant rate. Fluid migrates within a thin permeable layer parallel to and containing the fault plane. When the Poisson ratio $\nu=0$, self-similarity of the fluid pressure implies fault slip also evolves in an axisymmetric, self-similar manner, reducing the three-dimensional problem for the evolution of fault slip to a single self-similar dimension. The rupture radius grows as $\lambda \sqrt{4\alpha_{hy} t}$, where $t$ is time since the start of injection and $\alpha_{hy}$ is the hydraulic diffusivity of the pore fluid pressure. The prefactor $\lambda$ is determined by a single parameter, $T$, which depends on the pre-injection stress state and injection conditions. The prefactor has the range $0<\lambda<\infty$, the lower and upper limits of which correspond to marginal pressurization of the fault and critically stressed conditions, in which the fault-resolved shear stress is close to the pre-injection fault strength. In both limits, we derive solutions for slip by perturbation expansion, to arbitrary order. In the marginally pressurized limit ($\lambda\rightarrow 0$), the perturbation is regular and the series expansion is convergent. For the critically stressed limit ($\lambda\rightarrow \infty$), the perturbation is singular, contains a boundary layer and an outer solution, and the series is divergent. In this case, we provide a composite solution with uniform convergence over the entire rupture using a matched asymptotic expansion. We provide error estimates of the asymptotic expansions in both limits, and demonstrate optimal truncation of the singular perturbation in the critically stressed limit.

The determination of experimental sensitivity is a key step in the search for neutrinoless double beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$), providing a quantitative benchmark for detector design. Two commonly used statistical approaches are the counting method, which estimates sensitivity from the number of events in a predefined region of interest (RoI), and the fitting method, which extracts the signal contribution by fitting the full energy spectrum. In this work, we investigate both discovery sensitivity and exclusion sensitivity within these two approaches. Through statistical derivation and simulation verification, we show that the relative performance of the methods depends on both energy resolution and exposure, while at higher exposures the fitting method consistently yields more stringent sensitivity. These results provide guidance for selecting the optimal statistical method in future $0\nu\beta\beta$ experiments.

The square inverse law with distance plays an important role in many fields of physics covering electromagnetism, optics or acoustics. However, as every law in physics has its range of validity. We propose an open-inquiry laboratory where we challenge these concepts by proposing experiments where the intensity of light decays linearly or even remains constant over a range of distances. Using the light sensors built into smartphones, it is possible to measure light curves for different sources: point, linear, planar and even LED ring lights. The analysis of these curves allows us to discuss the limits of the physical theories. This low-cost laboratory, initially proposed in the context of the COVID19 pandemic, has the virtue of challenging intuition and encouraging the critical spirit of the students.

Indirect reciprocity as a dynamics for weak balance

Subjects:
Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph)
A social network is often divided into many factions. People are friends within each faction, while they are enemies of the other factions, and even my enemy's enemy is not necessarily my friend. This configuration can be described in terms of a weak form of structural balance. Although weak balance explains a number of real social networks, which dynamical rule achieves it has remained relatively unexplored. In this work, we show that the answer can be found in the field of indirect reciprocity, which assumes that people assess each other's behavior and choose how to behave to others based on the assessment according to a social norm. We begin by showing that weak structural balance is equivalent to stationarity when the rule is given by a norm called `judging'. By analyzing its cluster dynamics of merging, fission, and migration induced by assessment error in complete graphs, we obtain the cluster size distribution in a steady state, which shows the coexistence of a giant cluster and smaller ones. This study suggests that indirect reciprocity can provide insight into the interplay between a norm that individuals abide by and the macroscopic group structure in society.

Early diagnosis and noninvasive monitoring of neurological disorders require sensitivity to elusive cellular-level alterations that occur much earlier than volumetric changes observable with the millimeter-resolution of medical imaging modalities. Morphological changes in axons, such as axonal varicosities or beadings, are observed in neurological disorders, as well as in development and aging. Here, we reveal the sensitivity of time-dependent diffusion MRI (dMRI) to the structurally disordered axonal morphology at the micrometer scale. Scattering theory uncovers the two parameters that determine the diffusive dynamics of water along axons: the average reciprocal cross-section and the variance of long-range cross-sectional fluctuations. This theoretical development allows us to predict dMRI metrics sensitive to axonal alterations over tens of thousands of axons in seconds rather than months of simulations in a rat model of traumatic brain injury, and is corroborated with ex vivo dMRI. Our approach bridges the gap between micrometers and millimeters in resolution, offering quantitative and objective biomarkers applicable to a broad spectrum of neurological disorders.

It is known that ensembles of interacting oscillators or qubits can exhibit the phenomenon of quantum synchronization. In this work we consider a set of $N$ identical two-state systems that we call ``harmonic qubits'', because the kinetic part of their Hamiltonian is of the form $\omega_0 \sum_i a^\dagger_i a_i$, coupled through a multi-state ``photon'' mode subject to dissipation. It has been proven numerically that when the coupling between the qubits and the photon is sufficiently strong, the ensemble condenses into a ground state with negative energy, the energy gap is proportional to $N$ and there are clear cross correlations $\langle a^\dagger_i a_j \rangle$. Here we are interested into the energy spectrum of the excited states of this system. In order to obtain information on the coherent transitions we introduce a weak coupling of each qubit with an external oscillator of variable frequency $\omega$ and we check via Monte Carlo time evolution for which values of $\omega$ variations in the occupation of the external oscillator occur. After adding a second external oscillator coupled to the first only through the $N$ qubits, we also look at the energy transfer between the two external oscillators in dependence on their frequency, a transfer which is possible only through the excited states of the qubits. Above threshold (when $E_0<0$) we find resonant transfer at frequencies which are definitely higher, and growing with $N$. This signals the presence of collective excited states, separated by large energy gaps, which are absent below threshold.

In this study, we investigate the magnification and angular resolution of a single water droplet positioned on a glass surface, functioning as an optical imaging system. Through theoretical analysis of the droplet's shape, magnification, and angular resolution, we derive predictions that are subsequently validated through experiments. Our study explores the impact of key parameters, including droplet size, the distance between the droplet and the object, and the contact angle, on the aforementioned optical characteristics. Our findings reveal that smaller droplets exhibit higher magnification at shorter object-to-droplet distances and demonstrate superior resolving capability (i.e., smaller angular resolution).

When the Debye length is not resolved in a simulation using the most common particle-in-cell (PIC) algorithm, the plasma will unphysically heat until the Debye length becomes resolved via a phenomenon known as grid heating. This article presents detailed numerical measurements of grid heating for several explicit PIC algorithms including the first systematic (covering the Debye length resolution and drift-velocity parameter space) study of grid-heating growth rates for the most-common electrostatic momentum-conserving PIC algorithm. Additionally, we derive and test a cubic-spline-based PIC algorithm that ensures that the interpolated electric field has a continuous first derivative, but find that a differentiable electric field has minimal impact on grid-heating stability. Also considered are energy-conserving PIC algorithms with linear and quadratic interpolation functions. In all cases, we find that unphysical heating can occur for some combinations of Debye under-resolution and plasma drift. We demonstrate analytically and numerically that grid heating cannot be eliminated by using a higher-order field solve, and give an analytical expression for the cold-beam stability limits of some energy-conserving algorithms.

Reducing electromagnetic scattering from an object has always been a task, inspiring efforts across disciplines such as materials science and electromagnetic theory. The pursuit of electromagnetic cloaking significantly advanced the field of metamaterials, yet achieving broadband, conformal cloaking for complex, non-trivial objects remains an unresolved challenge. Here, we introduce the concept of 'tailor-made metasurfaces' - machine-designed aperiodic structures optimized to suppress scattering from arbitrary objects by accounting for their layout, including resonant or large-scale features. Specifically, we demonstrated a wideband ~20% fractional bandwidth scattering suppression of more than 20-30 dB for various generic test objects, including randomly distributed wire meshes, spheres, and polygons. The demonstrated evolutionary optimization marks a leap forward in electromagnetic design, enabling the development of high-performance structures to meet complex technological demands.

Machine learning potential-driven molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have significantly enhanced the predictive accuracy of thermal transport properties across diverse materials. However, extracting phonon-mode-resolved insights from these simulations remains a critical challenge. Here, we introduce PYSED, a Python-based package built on the spectral energy density (SED) method, designed to efficiently compute kinetic-energy-weighted phonon dispersion and extract phonon lifetime from large-scale MD simulation trajectories. By integrating high-accuracy machine-learned neuroevolution potential (NEP) models, we validate and showcase the effectiveness of the implemented SED method across systems of varying dimensionalities. Specifically, the NEP-driven MD-SED accurately reveals how phonon modes are affected by strain in carbon nanotubes, as well as by interlayer coupling strengths and the twist angles in two-dimensional molybdenum disulfide. For three-dimensional systems, the SED method effectively establishes the thermal transport regime diagram for metal-organic frameworks, distinguishing between particlelike and wavelike propagation regions. Moreover, using bulk silicon as an example, we show that phonon SED can efficiently capture quantum dynamics based on path-integral trajectories. The PYSED package bridges MD simulations with detailed phonon-mode insights, delivering a robust tool for investigating thermal transport properties with detailed mechanisms across various materials.

Surface tension estimation of bubble nuclei in magma using spinodal pressure and nonclassical nucleation theory

Efforts to estimate the magma decompression rate from the vesicular texture of volcanic products have progressed through the development of theoretical models and laboratory experiments. The theoretical model is based on nucleation theory, with the surface tension between the melt and bubble nucleus being the parameter that most strongly governs nucleation. Since direct measurement of surface tension is difficult, it has been calculated by inverting the bubble number density from experimental samples using classical or nonclassical nucleation theory formulas. However, in the nonclassical case, which accounts for the supersaturation dependence of surface tension, the pressure at the spinodal limit (where surface tension becomes zero) was previously unknown, necessitating complex mathematical operations. In this study, the spinodal pressure determined from the Gibbs energy curve was substituted into the nonclassical formula by approximating the water-saturated silicate melt as a two-component symmetric regular solution composed of silicate and water. This approach allowed for a more straightforward estimation of surface tension using data from past decompression experiments. Nevertheless, the resulting surface tension values were more scattered than those obtained using the classical formula, suggesting that applying the nonclassical formula to magma vesiculation is not valid at present. Resolving this issue will likely require an integrated understanding of the dependence of surface tension on both supersaturation and bubble radius. Such understanding would enable more accurate estimation of surface tension and contribute to reconciling the discrepancy between theoretical and experimental bubble number density values.

In particle physics experiments, identifying the types of particles registered in a detector is essential for the accurate reconstruction of particle collisions. At Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Lab), the GlueX experiment performs particle identification (PID) by setting specific thresholds, known as cuts, on the kinematic properties of tracks and showers obtained from detector hits. Our research aims to enhance this cut-based method by employing machine-learning algorithms based on multi-layer perceptrons and boosted decision trees. Similar approaches have been applied in other particle physics experiments and offer an opportunity to increase PID accuracies using reconstructed kinematic data. Our study illustrates that both multilayered perceptrons and boosted decision trees can identify charged and neutral particles in Monte Carlo simulated GlueX data with significantly improved accuracy over the current cuts-based PID method.

Simple and accurate complete elliptic integrals for the full range of modulus
Teepanis Chachiyo
Comments:
Comments are welcome. Fixed typos. Added comparison with mathematical inequalities
Subjects:
General Physics (physics.gen-ph)
The complete elliptic integral of the first and second kind, K(k) and E(k), appear in a multitude of physics and engineering applications. Because there is no known closed-form, the exact values have to be computed numerically. Here, approximations for the integrals are proposed based on their asymptotic behaviors. An inverse of K is also presented. As a result, the proposed K(k) and E(k) reproduce the exact analytical forms both in the zero and asymptotic limits, while in the mid-range of modulus maintain average error of 0.06% and 0.01% respectively. The key finding is the ability to compute the integrals with exceptional accuracy on both limits of elliptical conditions. An accuracy of 1 in 1,000 should be sufficient for practical or prototyping engineering and architecture designs. The simplicity should facilitate discussions of advanced physics topics in introductory physics classes, and enable broader collaborations among researchers from other fields of expertise. For example, the phase space of energy-conserving nonlinear pendulum using only elementary functions is discussed. The proposed inverse of K is shown to be Never Failing Newton Initialization and is an important step for the computation of the exact inverse. An algorithm based on Arithmetic-Geometric Mean for computing exact integrals and their derivatives are also presented, which should be useful in a platform that special functions are not accessible such as web-based and firmware developments. Comparisons with sharp bounds from the mathematical inequalities literature further highlight the competitiveness of the proposed approximations.

We have investigated strong-field-induced electronic coherences in argon and molecular nitrogen ions created by high-intensity, few-cycle infrared laser pulses. This is a step toward the long-sought goal of strong-field coherent control in molecular chemistry. We employed high-intensity, few-cycle infrared laser pulses in a pump-probe setup to investigate a recent prediction that electronic coherences in nitrogen molecules change the ion yields vs. pump-probe delay. [Yuen and Lin, Phys. Rev. A 109, L011101 (2024)]. The predicted coherence signals in molecular nitrogen could not be resolved above the optical interference of the pump and probe pulses; a simultaneous measurement clearly resolved the induced cation fine-structure coherence in strong-field-ionized argon. The results of our comparison with simulations suggest that optical interference effects manifest differently in each ionic species and must be carefully accounted for when interpreting experimental data. We found that nonsequential double ionization in the low-intensity region of the focal volume can reduce the visibility of coherence generated by two-pulse sequential ionization, and we quantify the importance of pulse shape and spectral characteristics for isolating the desired coherence signals.

A two-beam high-power laser facility is essential for the study of one of the most captivating phenomena predicted by strong-field quantum electrodynamics (QED) and yet unobserved experimentally: the avalanche-type cascade. In such a cascade, the energy of intense laser light can be efficiently transformed into high-energy radiation and electron-positron pairs. The future 50-petawatt-scale laser facility NSF OPAL will provide unique opportunities for studying such strong-field QED effects, as it is designed to deliver two ultra-intense, tightly focused laser pulses onto the interaction point. In this work, we investigate the potential of such a facility for studying elementary particle and plasma dynamics deeply in the quantum radiation-dominated regime, and the generation of QED avalanches. With 3D particle-in-cell simulations, we demonstrate that QED avalanche precursors can be reliably triggered under realistic laser parameters and layout (namely, focusing $f/2$, tilted optical axes, and non-ideal co-pointing) with the anticipated capabilities of NSF OPAL. We demonstrate that seed electrons can be efficiently injected into the laser focus by using targets of three types: a gas of heavy atoms, an overcritical plasma, and a thin foil. A strong positron and high-energy photon signal is generated in all cases. The cascade properties can be identified from the final particle distributions, which have a clear directional pattern. At increasing laser field intensity, such distributions provide signatures of the transition, first, to the radiation-dominated interaction regime, and then to a QED avalanche. Our findings can also be used for designing related future experiments.

Background: The emergence and growth of fusion technology enables investigative studies into its applications beyond typical power production facilities. This study seeks to determine the viability of medical isotope production with the neutrons produced in an example large fusion device. Using FISPACT-II (a nuclear inventory code) and a simulated fusion spectrum, the production yields of a significant number of potentially clinically relevant (both in use and novel) medical isotopes were calculated. Comparative calculations were also conducted against existing production routes.
Results: Depending on the neutron flux of the fusion device, it could be an ideal technology to produce alpha-emitters such as 212Bi/212Pb, it may be able to contribute to the production of 99mTc/99Mo, and could offer an alternative route in the production a few Auger-emitting candidates. There is also a long list of beta-emitting nuclides where fusion technology may be best placed to produce over existing technologies including 67Cu, 90Y and 47Sc.
Conclusions: It is theoretically viable to produce existing and novel medical isotopes with fusion technology. However, a significant number of assumptions form the basis of this study which would need to be studied further for any particular nuclide of interest.

ColdADC is a custom ASIC digitizer implemented in 65 nm CMOS technology using specialized techniques for long-term reliability in cryogenic environments. ColdADC was developed for use in the DUNE Far Detector complex, which will consist of four liquid argon time projection chambers. Each contains 17 kilotons liquid argon as the target material in order to measure neutrino oscillations. Approximately 40,000 ColdADC ASICs will be installed for DUNE in the first two large detectors and will be operated at cryogenic temperatures during the experiment without replacement. The lifetime of the ColdADC is a critical parameter affecting the data quality and physics sensitivity of the experiment. A measurement of the lifetime of the ColdADC was carried out, and the results shown in this paper assure orders of magnitude longer lifetime of the ColdADC than the planned operation time of the detectors.

This work reports on the performance of a novel neutron-sensitive scintillating detector fabricated using Fused-Deposition Modelling (FDM) additive manufacturing. FDM is a cost-effective 3D-printing method employing flexible plastic filaments to create custom-shaped components. Scintillating filaments, based on polystyrene doped with \emph{p}-terphenyl and 1,4-bis (5-phenyloxazol-2-yl) benzene, and enriched with $^6$LiF to enable neutron sensitivity were manufactured in house and achieved visible scintillation with a light output of 30$\pm$5~photons per MeV. Printed scintillators were then integrated into a detector system consisting of an image intensified TimePix3 camera, offering high spatial and temporal resolution. The detector performance was compared with Geant4 simulations of the scintillating sensor's response to electrons, gamma-rays, and thermal neutrons. A novel event discrimination algorithm, using the properties of the TimePix3 camera, enabled the separation of neutron signatures from the gamma-ray background.

Gaussian process regression techniques have been used in fluid mechanics for the reconstruction of flow fields from a reduction-of-dimension perspective. A main ingredient in this setting is the construction of adapted covariance functions, or kernels, to obtain such estimates. In this paper, we present a general method for constraining a prescribed Gaussian process on an arbitrary compact set. The kernel of the pre-defined process must be at least continuous and may include other information about the studied phenomenon. This general boundary-constraining framework can be implemented with high flexibility for a broad range of engineering applications. From this, we derive physics-informed kernels for simulating two-dimensional velocity fields of an incompressible (divergence-free) flow around aerodynamic profiles. These kernels allow to define Gaussian process priors satisfying the incompressibility condition and the prescribed boundary conditions along the profile in a continuous manner. We describe an adapted numerical method for the boundary-constraining procedure parameterized by a measure on the compact set. The relevance of the methodology and performances are illustrated by numerical simulations of flows around a cylinder and a NACA 0412 airfoil profile, for which no observation at the boundary is needed at all.

The optical cycle-averaged ionization rate of Ar, O$_{2}$, and N$_{2}$ vs. local instantaneous laser intensity $I$ for linear polarized $800$ nm light is determined up to approx. $300$ TW/cm$^{2}$ by numerically inverting published time-of-flight ion spectrometer data. The published Ar$^{+}$ collection efficiency of the microchannel plate (MCP) at the end of the spectrometer and its $I_{0}$ scale are recalibrated by fitting it to its high $I_{0}$ solution. The relative collection efficiencies of the other species are determined by published MCP cathode data. Results for O$_2$ are consistent with a reevaluation of published data used to determine its cross section $\sigma_8$ in the multiphoton (low $I$) regime.

Many systems involve numerous interacting parts and the whole system can have properties that the individual parts do not. I take this novelty as the defining characteristic of an emergent property. Other characteristics associated with emergence discussed include universality, order, complexity, unpredictability, irreducibility, diversity, self-organisation, discontinuities, and singularities. Emergent phenomena are widespread across physics, biology, social sciences, and computing, and are central to major scientific and societal challenges. Understanding emergence involves considering the stratification of reality across different scales (energy, time, length, complexity), each with its distinct ontology and epistemology, leading to semi-autonomous scientific disciplines. A central challenge is bridging the gap between macroscopic emergent properties and microscopic component interactions. Identifying an intermediate mesoscopic scale where new, weakly interacting entities or modular structures emerge is key. Theoretical approaches, such as effective theories (describing phenomena at a specific scale) and toy models (simplified systems for analysis), are vital. The Ising model exemplifies how toy models can elucidate emergence characteristics. Emergence is central to condensed matter physics, chaotic systems, fluid dynamics, nuclear physics, quantum gravity, neural networks, protein folding, and social segregation. An emergent perspective should influence scientific strategy by shaping research questions, methodologies, priorities, and resource allocation. An elusive goal is the design and control of emergent properties.

A scheme for generation of monochromatic Cherenkov radiation in a thin dielectric layer is proposed. The electrons travel in vacuum parallel to a dielectric, exciting a single synchronous electromagnetic waveguide mode. The proposed scheme is studied quantitatively for near-infrared radiation in silicon induced by a 100-keV electron beam, using time-domain and frequency-domain numerical simulations, with material absorption and dispersion taken into account. This method of radiation generation can be scaled from ultraviolet to terahertz radiation by changing the thickness of the dielectric layer and choosing a material with low loss at the desired wavelength. Comparison with conventional Cherenkov Radiation and Cherenkov Diffraction Radiation is also presented.

Precision atomic and quantum experiments rely on ultra-stable narrow linewidth lasers constructed using table-top ultra-low expansion reference cavities. These experiments often require multiple lasers, operating at different wavelengths, to perform key steps used in state preparation and measurement required in quantum sensing and computing. This is traditionally achieved by disciplining a cavity-stabilized laser to a key atomic transition and then transferring the transition linewidth and stability to other lasers using the same reference cavity in combination with bulk-optic frequency shifting such as acousto-optic modulators. Transitioning such capabilities to a low cost photonic-integrated platform will enable a wide range of portable, low power, scalable quantum experiments and applications. Yet, today's bulk optic approaches pose challenges related to lack of cavity tunability, large free spectral range, and limited photonic integration potential. Here, we address these challenges with demonstration of an agile photonic-integrated 780 nm ultra-high-Q tunable silicon nitride reference cavity that performs multiple critical experimental steps including laser linewidth narrowing, high resolution rubidium spectroscopy, dual-stage stabilization to a rubidium transition, and stability transfer to other lasers. We achieve up to 20 dB of frequency noise reduction at 10 kHz offset, precision spectroscopy over a 250 MHz range, and dual-stage locking to rubidium with an Allan deviation of $8.5 \times 10^{-12}$ at 1 s and up to 40 dB reduction at 100 Hz. We further demonstrate the transfer of this atomic stability to a second laser, via the rubidium-disciplined cavity, and demonstrate multi-wavelength Rydberg electrometry quantum sensing. These results pave the path for integrated, compact, and scalable solutions for quantum sensing, computing and other atomic and trapped ion applications.

Laser-induced damage is a serious challenge for optical components; therefore, determining the laser-induced damage threshold (LIDT) is a crucial step in the manufacturing process. In many cases, such as for space applications, it is also necessary to account for the vacuum environment. Since conventional damage detection methods face limitations under vacuum conditions, an alternative approach is required. This article introduces a He-Ne laser imaging system designed for in-situ damage detection within a LIDT station. The system enables fourfold magnification imaging of the test sample and its surroundings without placing imaging optics inside the vacuum chamber, thereby preserving the cleanliness of the chamber. The detection method can be applied to both transparent and opaque samples; in transparent optics, damage is observable from either side. To verify the system's functionality, two sample types were investigated: a silica wafer (non-transparent for He-Ne radiation) and a commonly used dielectric mirror for 1030 nm (transparent for He-Ne radiation). Particular attention was devoted to determining the minimum damage size that can be reliably recognized. The system successfully distinguished damage features as small as 35 ${\mu}$m.

In this work, we demonstrate a high-performance surface acoustic wave (SAW) delay line based on a Scandium alloyed aluminum nitride (AlScN)-on-sapphire platform operating at 5.9 GHz with an exceptionally high acoustic propagation Q-factor. An 800 nm AlScN thin film with 40% scandium alloying concentration was deposited on a thick sapphire substrate to achieve strong acoustic energy confinement and large electromechanical coupling effect, thereby minimizing the insertion loss (IL) and propagation loss (PL) of the acoustic delay line (ADL). The proposed ADL was designed to operate in the Sezawa mode using a Single-Phase Unidirectional Transducer (SPUDT) electrode configuration for better unidirectionality. The fabricated ADLs with different delay lengths, after conjugate matching, exhibited delay times spanning 13 to 214 ns and IL ranging from 7.6 to 18.3 dB. The extracted PL reached as low as 9.2 dB/mm at 5.9 GHz, with a group velocity (v_g) of around 5,779 m/s. Based on these results, the proposed ADLs exhibit a high acoustic propagation Q-factor of 3,044. These findings highlight the potential of AlScN-on-sapphire platforms for high operational frequency, low-loss SAW ADL devices in advanced RF applications.

Simple Vector Magnetometer Based on Ground State Hanle Effect

Subjects:
Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph); Optics (physics.optics)
We present a method for determining the azimuthal phase (angle) of a magnetic field by exploiting phase matching of laser beams in a ground-state Hanle effect (GHSE) configuration. This approach is based on the symmetry of the system's Hamiltonian and the existence of a phase-independent frame, allowing for direct determination of the field orientation. As a proof of concept, we performed preliminary experiments using the Fg=1 to Fe=0 transition of the D2 line in 87Rb, with three laser beams to demonstrate the phase (azimuthal) dependence of the observed Hanle resonance signals. While our current setup does not include active phase control, the key features predicted by our method were observed, validating its conceptual foundation. Additionally, we measured two components of the stray magnetic field in our laboratory as an illustration. This method leverages the Hanle effect's inherent sensitivity to both the magnitude and orientation of magnetic fields, as well as the underlying symmetry properties of the atomic system, and offers a pathway for precise, calibration-free determination of magnetic field orientation.

Topological Photon Transport in Programmable Photonic Processors via Discretized Evolution of Synthetic Magnetic Fields

Optics (physics.optics); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
Photons, unlike electrons, do not couple directly to magnetic fields, yet synthetic gauge fields can impart magnetic-like responses and enable topological transport. Discretized Floquet evolution provides a controlled route, where the time-ordered sequencing of non-commuting Hamiltonians imprints complex hopping phases and breaks time-reversal symmetry. However, stabilizing such driven dynamics and observing unambiguous topological signatures on a reconfigurable platform has remained challenging. Here we demonstrate synthetic gauge fields for light on a programmable photonic processor by implementing discretized Floquet drives that combine static and dynamic phases. This approach reveals hallmark features of topological transport: chiral circulation that reverses under drive inversion, flux-controlled interference with high visibility, and robust directional flow stabilized by maximizing the minimal Floquet quasi-energy gap. The dynamics are further characterized by a first-harmonic phase order parameter, whose per-period winding number quantifies angular drift and reverses sign with the drive order. These results establish discretized, gap-optimized Floquet evolution as a versatile and fully programmable framework for topological photonics, providing a compact route to engineer gauge fields, stabilize driven phases, and probe winding-number signatures of chiral transport.

Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have recently been extensively applied to model the time-evolution in fluid dynamics, weather predictions, and even chaotic systems thanks to their ability to capture temporal dependencies and sequential patterns in data. Here we present a RNN model based on convolution neural networks for modeling the nonlinear non-adiabatic dynamics of hybrid quantum-classical systems. The dynamical evolution of the hybrid systems is governed by equations of motion for classical degrees of freedom and von Neumann equation for electrons. The physics-aware recurrent convolution (PARC) neural network structure incorporates a differentiator-integrator architecture that inductively models the spatiotemporal dynamics of generic physical systems. We apply our RNN approach to learn the space-time evolution of a one-dimensional semi-classical Holstein model after an interaction quench. For shallow quenches (small changes in electron-lattice coupling), the deterministic dynamics can be accurately captured using a single-CNN-based recurrent network. In contrast, deep quenches induce chaotic evolution, making long-term trajectory prediction significantly more challenging. Nonetheless, we demonstrate that the PARC-CNN architecture can effectively learn the statistical climate of the Holstein model under deep-quench conditions.

We demonstrate that higher-order electric susceptibilities in crystals can be enhanced and understood through nontrivial topological invariants and quantum geometry, using one-dimensional $\pi$-conjugated chains as representative model systems. First, we show that the crystalline-symmetry-protected topology of these chains imposes a lower bound on their quantum metric and hyperpolarizabilities. Second, we employ numerical simulations to reveal the tunability of nonlinear, quantum geometry-driven optical responses in various one-dimensional crystals in which band topology can be externally controlled. Third, we develop a semiclassical picture to deliver an intuitive understanding of these effects. Our findings offer a firm interpretation of otherwise elusive experimental observations of colossal hyperpolarizabilities and establish guidelines for designing topological materials of any dimensionality with enhanced nonlinear optical properties.

A Variational Principle for Extended Irreversible Thermodynamics: Heat Conducting Viscous Fluids

Journal of Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics, 2025
Subjects:

Extended irreversible thermodynamics is a theory that expands the classical framework of nonequilibrium thermodynamics by going beyond the local-equilibrium assumption. A notable example of this is the Maxwell-Cattaneo heat flux model, which introduces a time lag in the heat flux response to temperature gradients. In this paper, we develop a variational formulation of the equations of extended irreversible thermodynamics by introducing an action principle for a nonequilibrium Lagrangian that treats thermodynamic fluxes as independent variables. A key feature of this approach is that it naturally extends both Hamilton's principle of reversible continuum mechanics and the earlier variational formulation of classical irreversible thermodynamics. The variational principle is initially formulated in the material (Lagrangian) description, from which the Eulerian form is derived using material covariance (or relabeling symmetries). The tensorial structure of the thermodynamic fluxes dictates the choice of objective rate in the Eulerian description, and plays a central role in the emergence of nonequilibrium stresses - arising from both viscous and thermal effects - that are essential to ensure thermodynamic consistency. This framework naturally results in the Cattaneo-Christov model for heat flux. We also investigate the extension of the approach to accommodate higher-order fluxes and the general form of entropy fluxes. The variational framework presented in this paper has promising applications in the development of structure-preserving and thermodynamically consistent numerical methods. It is particularly relevant for modeling systems where entropy production is a delicate issue that requires careful treatment to ensure consistency with the laws of thermodynamics.

The closed-form expressions of electric potentials and field lines for a uniformly-charged tube and cylinder are presented using elliptic integrals and Appell's hypergeometric functions, where field lines are depicted by introducing the concept of the field line potential in axisymmetric systems, whose contour lines represent electric field lines outside the charged region, thought of as an analog of the conjugate harmonic function in the presence of non-uniform metric. The field line potential for the tube shows a multi-valued behavior and enables us to define a topological charge. The integral of $Z(u|m)\operatorname{sc}(u|m)$, where $ Z $ and $ \operatorname{sc} $ are the Jacobi zeta and elliptic functions, is also expressed by Appell's hypergeometric function as a by-product, which was missing in classical tables of formulas. In the Addendum appended after the main article, several relevant references are provided and the decomposition of the solution by ``degrees of transcendence'' is proposed.

We consider a simple thermodynamically consistent model that captures the self-organized chemomechanical coupling resulting from the interplay between autocatalytically reacting surfactants, the Marangoni effect and wetting dynamics. An ambient bath of surfactant acts as a chemostat and provides the system with chemical fuel, thereby driving it away from thermodynamic equilibrium. We find that a positive feedback loop between the local reactions and the Marangoni effect induces surface tension gradients that allow for self-propelled droplets. Besides simple directional motion, we find crawling and shuttling droplets as well as droplets performing random walks, thus exploring the entire substrate. We study the occurring chemomechanical motility modes and show how the observed dynamic states emerge from local and global bifurcations. Due to the underlying generic thermodynamic structure, we expect that our results are relevant not only to directly related biomimetic droplet systems but also to structurally similar systems like chemically active phase-separating mixtures.

This provides the necessary tools for addressing signal-to-noise ratio concerns for GI acquisitions in emerging and cutting-edge low-light GI scenarios.

Aluminum scandium nitride (AlScN) ferroelectrics are promising for next-generation non-volatile memory applications due to their high remnant polarization as well as fast switching and scalability to nanometer thicknesses. As device dimensions shrink, the coercive field in ultra-thin ferroelectric films increases, which challenges low-voltage operation. We demonstrate that interfacial engineering through bottom electrode selection and strain management reduces this coercive field increase and improves ferroelectric performance. Robust ferroelectricity is observed in ultra-thin AlScN capacitors deposited on a Sc bottom electrode under both alternating current and direct current conditions. The coercive field is reduced by over 20 percent compared to capacitors with an Al bottom electrode. Furthermore, dynamic switching behavior is analyzed using the KAI model. At low frequencies (less than 16.7 kHz), capacitors with Sc and Al bottom electrodes exhibit comparable KAI exponents (0.036 and 0.028, respectively), indicating similar switching kinetics. However, at higher frequencies, the capacitor with an Al bottom electrode shows a significantly higher exponent (0.093), indicating stronger frequency dependence, whereas the capacitor with a Sc bottom electrode maintains a stable exponent of 0.036. Scanning Electron Nanobeam Diffraction is used to measure strain differences in AlScN thin films grown on templates with different lattice mismatch, revealing a correlation between lattice mismatch, film strain, and switching behavior in ultra-thin films.

In this paper, using 3D Technology Computer-Aided-Design (TCAD) simulations, we show that it is possible to design a static random-access memory (SRAM) using gate-all-around field-effect-transistor (GAA-FET) technology so that it is immune to single alpha particle radiation error. In other words, with the design, there will be no single-event upset (SEU) due to alpha particles. We first use ab initio calculations in PHITS to show that there is a maximum linear energy transfer (LET), LETmax, for the alpha particle in Si and Si$_x$Ge$_{1-x}$. Based on that, by designing a sub-7nm GAA-FET-based SRAM with bottom dielectric isolation (BDI), we show that the SRAM does not flip even if the particle strike is in the worst-case scenario.

Strong excitonic coupling and photon antibunching (AB) have been observed together in Venus yellow fluorescent protein dimers and currently lack a cohesive theoretical explanation. In 2019, Kim et al. demonstrated Davydov splitting in circular dichroism spectra, revealing strong J-like coupling, while antibunched fluorescence emission was confirmed by combined antibunching--fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (AB/FCS fingerprinting). To investigate the implications of this coexistence, Venus dimer population dynamics are modeled within a Lindblad master equation framework, justified by the separation of characteristic coupling, dephasing, and thermal relaxation rates. Simulations predict rapid decoherence, yielding bright/dark state mixtures consistent with antibunched fluorescence emission at room temperature. Thus, excitonic coupling and photon AB are reconciled without invoking long-lived quantum coherence. More broadly, fluorescent proteins emerge as tractable model systems for probing evolutionary pressures on chromoprotein photophysics and quantum dynamics. Cryogenic cooling may extend coherence time into the regime required for ultrafast gate operations, suggesting fluorescent protein dimers as a viable platform for bio-inspired qubits.

The goal of this study is to estimate the amount of lost data in electron microscopy and to analyze the extent to which experimentally acquired images are utilized in peer-reviewed scientific publications. Analysis of the number of images taken on electron microscopes at a core user facility and the number of images subsequently included in peer-reviewed scientific journals revealed low efficiency of data utilization. Up to around 90% of electron microscopy data generated during routine instrument operation remain unused. Of the more than 150 000 electron microscopy images evaluated in this study, only approximately 3 500 (just over 2%) were made available in publications. For the analyzed dataset, the amount of lost data in electron microscopy can be estimated as >90% (in terms of data being recorded but not being published in peer-reviewed literature). On the one hand, these results highlight a shortcoming in the optimal use of microscopy images; on the other hand, they indicate the existence of a large pool of electron microscopy data that can facilitate research in data science and the development of AI-based projects. The considerations important to unlock the potential of lost data are discussed in the present article.

Magnetic materials often exhibit complex energy landscapes with multiple local minima, each corresponding to a self-consistent electronic structure solution. Finding the global minimum is challenging, and heuristic methods are not always guaranteed to succeed. Here, we apply a recently developed automated workflow to systematically explore the energy landscape of 194 magnetic monolayers obtained from the Materials Cloud 2D crystals database and determine their ground-state magnetic order. Our approach enables effective control and sampling of orbital occupation matrices, allowing rapid identification of local minima. We find a diverse set of self-consistent collinear metastable states, further enriched by Hubbard-corrected energy functionals, when the $U$ parameters have been computed from first principles using linear-response theory. We categorise the monolayers by their magnetic ordering and highlight promising candidates. Our results include 109 ferromagnetic, 83 antiferromagnetic, and 2 altermagnetic monolayers, along with 12 novel ferromagnetic half-metals with potential for spintronics technologies.

We theoretically study time-dependent correlations in a strongly driven array of $N$ two-level atoms, coupled to photons in a waveguide. We focus on the spectrum $\{\lambda\}$ of the Liouvillian superoperator, which determines the correlation decay rates $-\Re \lambda$ and the frequencies $\Im\lambda$. Our main finding is the suppression of subradiant oscillating correlations between atomic states by a strong coherent drive of amplitude $\Omega$: $|\Re \lambda|\ge m\gamma/2$, where $\gamma$ is the single-atom spontaneous decay rate and $m=|\Im \lambda/(2\Omega)|$ is a nonzero integer for correlations oscillating in time $\propto \exp(\pm 2i m|\Omega| t)$. This limit is independent of the number of atoms $N$; it holds both for small arrays and in the macroscopic limit. We demonstrate the suppression of subradiance numerically and provide a rigorous proof based on the analytical decomposition of the Liouvillian using spectral theory of simplicial complexes and posets.

Title:
Mitigating the sign problem by quantum computing

The notorious sign problem severely limits the applicability of quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations, as statistical errors grow exponentially with system size and inverse temperature. A recent proposal of a quantum-computing stochastic series expansion (qc-SSE) method suggested that the problem could be avoided by introducing constant energy shifts into the Hamiltonian. Here we critically examine this framework and show that it does not strictly resolve the sign problem for Hamiltonians with non-commuting terms. Instead, it provides a practical mitigation strategy that suppresses the occurrence of negative weights. Using the antiferromagnetic anisotropic XY chain as a test case, we analyze the dependence of the average sign on system size, temperature, anisotropy, and shift parameters. An operator contraction method is introduced to improve efficiency. Our results demonstrate that moderate shifts optimally balance sign mitigation and statistical accuracy, while large shifts amplify errors, leaving the sign problem unresolved but alleviated.

Boron-doped diamond crystals (BDD, C$_{1-x}$B$_{x}$) exhibit exceptional mechanical strength, electronic tunability, and resistance to radiation damage. This makes them promising materials for use in gamma-ray crystal-based light sources. To better understand and quantify the structural distortions introduced by doping, which are critical for maintaining channelling efficiency, we perform atomistic-level molecular dynamics simulations on periodic C$_{1-x}$B$_{x}$ systems of various sizes. These simulations allow the influence of boron concentration on the lattice constant and the (110) and (100) inter-planar distances to be evaluated over the concentration range from pure diamond (0%) to 5% boron at room temperature (300 K). Linear relationships between both lattice constant and inter-planar distance with increasing dopant concentration are observed, with a deviation from Vegard's Law. This deviation is larger than that reported by other theoretical and computational studies; however, this may be attributed to an enhanced crystal quality over these studies, a vital aspect when considering gamma-ray crystal light source design. The methodology presented here incorporates several refinements to closely reflect the conditions of microwave plasma chemical vapour deposition (MPCVD) crystal growth. Validation of the methodology is provided through a comprehensive statistical analysis of the structure of our generated crystals. These results enable reliable atomistic modelling of doped diamond crystals and support their use in the design and fabrication of periodically bent structures for next-generation gamma-ray light source technologies.

Title:
Fast Unbiased Sampling of Networks with Given Expected Degrees and Strengths

The configuration model is a cornerstone of statistical assessment of network structure. While the Chung-Lu model is among the most widely used configuration models, it systematically oversamples edges between large-degree nodes, leading to inaccurate statistical conclusions. Although the maximum entropy principle offers unbiased configuration models, its high computational cost has hindered widespread adoption, making the Chung-Lu model an inaccurate yet persistently practical choice. Here, we propose fast and efficient sampling algorithms for the max-entropy-based models by adapting the Miller-Hagberg algorithm. Evaluation on 103 empirical networks demonstrates 10-1000 times speedup, making theoretically rigorous configuration models practical and contributing to a more accurate understanding of network structure.
