Optical sound pressure measurement is a promising technology to establish primary acoustic standards without reliance on specific types of microphones. We developed a precision optical sound pressure measurement system by combining a Fabry-pérot optical cavity, a phase-stabilized optical frequency comb, and a custom-made phasemeter. The optical cavity detects changes in the air's refractive index induced by sound waves as changes in its resonance frequency. A continuous-wave laser frequency is stabilized at the resonance, and the frequency comb detects the changes in the laser frequency. The frequency changes are measured with high sensitivity and accuracy using a phasemeter that we developed. The sound pressures measured by this system agreed with the measurement value obtained using a reference microphone within 5% at sound pressure levels of 78 dB and 84 dB, within a frequency range of 100 Hz to 1 kHz. A systematic deviation of 2.6% was observed, with the optical system yielding higher values than the microphone. To identify the cause of this deviation, we performed vibration displacement measurements of the cavity mirrors and finite element analysis, which revealed that fluctuations in the optical path length due to insufficient fixation of the mirrors were responsible.

To study the mechanical behavior of mock high explosives, an experimental and simulation program was developed to calibrate, with quantified uncertainty, a material model of the bonded granular material Idoxuridine and nitroplasticized Estane-5703. This paper reports on the efficacy of such a framework as a generalizable methodology for calibrating material models against experimental data with uncertainty quantification. Additionally, this paper studies the effect of two manufacturing temperatures and three initial granular configurations on the unconfined compressive behavior of the resulting bonded granular materials. In each of these cases, the same calibration framework was used; in that, hundreds of high-fidelity direct numerical simulations using a new, GPU-enabled, high-performance finite element method software, Ratel, were run to calibrate a finite-strain phase-field fracture model against experimental data. It was found that manufacturing temperature influenced the elastic response of the mock high explosives, with higher temperatures yielding a stiffer response. By contrast, it was found that the initial configuration of the grains had a negligible impact on the overall behavior of the mock high explosives, though it remains possible that local damage accumulation within the specimens could be altered by the initial configurations. Overall, the calibration framework was successful at creating well-calibrated models, showing its usefulness as an engineering and scientific tool.

DeepSeasons: a Deep Learning scale-selecting approach to Seasonal Forecasts
A. Navarra, G. G. Navarra
Subjects:
Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics (physics.ao-ph); Machine Learning (cs.LG)
Seasonal forecasting remains challenging due to the inherent chaotic nature of atmospheric dynamics. This paper introduces DeepSeasons, a novel deep learning approach designed to enhance the accuracy and reliability of seasonal forecasts. Leveraging advanced neural network architectures and extensive historical climatic datasets, DeepSeasons identifies complex, nonlinear patterns and dependencies in climate variables with similar or improved skill respcet GCM-based forecasting methods, at a significant lower cost. The framework also allow tailored application to specific regions or variables, rather than the overall problem of predicting the entire atmosphere/ocean system. The proposed methods also allow for direct predictions of anomalies and time-means, opening a new approach to long-term forecasting and highlighting its potential for operational deployment in climate-sensitive sectors. This innovative methodology promises substantial improvements in managing climate-related risks and decision-making processes.

Subjects:
Classical Physics (physics.class-ph); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
This paper examines the intuitive meaning of the Saint--Venant compatibility equation known from the linear theory of deformations. The linearized theory is typically obtained from the relations of finite deformation theory by neglecting higher-order terms. We show how to formulate the compatibility conditions for finite deformations and how the well-known equation for small deformations follows from this formulation.

General Physics (physics.gen-ph)
In the framework of the quantum theory of many-particle systems, we study the compatibility of approximated Non-Equilibrium Green Functions (NEGFs) and of approximated solutions of the Dyson equation with a modified continuity equation of the form $\partial_t \langle \rho \rangle+(1-\gamma)\nabla\cdot \langle\mathbf{J} \rangle=0$. A continuity equation of this kind allows the e.m.\ coupling of the system in the extended Aharonov-Bohm electrodynamics, but not in Maxwell electrodynamics. Focusing on the case of molecular junctions simulated numerically with the Density Functional Theory (DFT), we further discuss the re-definition of local current density proposed by Wang et al., which also turns out to be compatible with the extended Aharonov-Bohm electrodynamics.

Title:
Development of a national thrust test facility for electric propulsion at Robinson Research Institute, New Zealand

Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det); Accelerator Physics (physics.acc-ph); Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph)
The Robinson Research Institute is developing a type of electric propulsion for spacecraft called an applied-field magneto-plasma-dynamic (AF-MPD) thruster. The applied field module of the thruster features a cryocooler-cooled high-temperature-superconducting (HTS) magnet generating central fields exceeding 1 Tesla. This paper reports on the progress to date of the thruster test facilities established at the Institute to enable development of the AF-MPD and electric propulsion in general. The vacuum facilities consist primarily of a 1 m diameter, 3 m3 cylindrical chamber with a high-vacuum pumping speed, measured to be about 4200 L/s (Ar). The chamber can be reduced from atmospheric pressure to 1E10-5 hPa in about 2 h, enabling a rapid testing turn-around time, and maintains 5E10-4 hPa during thruster operation at typical mass flow rates of 5 mg/s (Ar). A pendulum thrust-stand has been purpose built to withstands static thruster loads of up to 30 kg and measure thrust forces up to 200 mN. It is also designed to be inherently insensitive to the unique challenges of measuring AF-MPD with superconducting magnets; strong magnetic fields, cryocooler vibration, and the thermal gradients. Initial thrust-stand testing, whilst implementing both water-cooling and a cryocooler showed it to be capable of measuring forces to a precision of approximately 1 mN and with an absolute accuracy of +/-2.3 mN (full scale). An extensive suite of software tools has also been developed to coordinate the large set of instruments needed to run the vacuum facilities, the thrust-stand, HTS magnet and cryocooler in addition to the many other auxiliary- and logging systems. Various upgrades to the facilities are in progress or planned.

Title:
Assessing the Limits of Graph Neural Networks for Vapor-Liquid Equilibrium Prediction: A Cryogenic Mixture Case Study
Aryan Gupta
Subjects:
Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph); Machine Learning (cs.LG); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph)
Accurate and fast thermophysical models are needed to embed vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) calculations in design, optimization, and control loops for cryogenic mixtures. This study asks whether a structure-aware graph neural network (GNN; DimeNet++) trained on GERG-2008/CoolProp data can act as a practical surrogate for an equation of state (EoS). We generate a ternary dataset over 90-200 K and pressures to 100 bar, curate it with a 15% density filter (reducing 5,200 states to 1,516), and pair each state with a lightweight molecular-dynamics snapshot to supply structural features. The model is trained in two stages; pretraining on residual Helmholtz energy followed by pressure fine-tuning with a stability penalty; and evaluated via single-phase interpolation tests, solver-free derivative-quality diagnostics, an audited VLE driver, and a latency benchmark. Within its regime, the GNN interpolates single-phase properties reasonably well; however, the VLE driver accepts no GNN equilibria on tested binaries (all plotted VLE points are CoolProp fallback or the solver fails), and diagnostic probes reveal jagged P(V|T) paths and thermal-stability flags concentrated in dense/cold regions, indicating insufficient derivative smoothness/consistency for robust equilibrium solving. An end-to-end timing comparison shows no single-phase speed advantage relative to CoolProp (tens of milliseconds vs sub-millisecond). We conclude that, as configured, the surrogate in this study is not solver-ready for VLE and offers no runtime benefit; its value is methodological, delineating failure modes and pointing to remedies such as physics-informed training signals and targeted coverage near phase boundaries.

Soft quantum back reaction to the Hubble tension: a smeared-out early time cosmological energy density
Alex E. Bernardini
Comments:

Subjects:
General Physics (physics.gen-ph)
A theoretical explanation for the so-called Hubble tension is provided within the framework of phase-space quantum mechanics extended to (quantum) cosmology. Following a description of the overall nature of this tension, with due attention to recent observational developments, a quantum cosmology framework based on the Weyl-Wigner phase-space quantum approach is presented. This circumvents the discrepancy between early- and late-time Universe predictions for the Hubble constant, $H_0$. The emergence of quantum-origin corrections dependent on a single parameter -- mediated by (generic) localized phase-space quantum states free of data analysis -- yields predictions for $H_0$ that smoothly interpolate between early- and late-time phenomenological values, thereby joining the plethora of solutions for the Hubble tension.

Diagonal Born-Oppenheimer Corrections in Condensed-Phase Ring Polymer Surface Hopping

Subjects:
Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
Ring-polymer surface hopping (RPSH) is a unique mixed quantum-classical dynamics method that seamlessly incorporates nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) into non-adiabatic dynamics simulations via the extended phase-space of a classical ring polymer. Here, we systematically investigate several variants of RPSH in the frameworks of centroid and bead approximations (RPSH-CA and RPSH-BA) in modeling the dynamics of the spin-boson system across different reaction regimes, reorganization energies, and temperatures. Moreover, the effects of including the diagonal Born-Oppenheimer correction (DBOC) on the performance of the RPSH-CA and RPSH-BA methods are investigated. Our results show that the RPSH-CA method, where non-adiabatic transitions are handled at the centroid level, reliably captures NQEs and remains robust across different reaction regimes. Adding DBOC improves the method's accuracy in specific intermediate and non-adiabatic reaction regimes at low temperature. Conversely, adding DBOC to the conventional fewest-switches surface hopping method was found to over-damp the dynamics significantly and reduce accuracy, especially at low temperatures. On the other hand, RPSH-BA results, where non-adiabatic transitions are handled at the level of individual beads of the ring polymers, are generally unreliable unless in the adiabatic reaction regime and at high temperature. The inclusion of DBOC is not particularly helpful in remedying this erratic behavior. As such, RPSH-BA is not recommended for including NQEs in condensed-phase non-adiabatic dynamics simulations despite its early successful reports in 1D scattering models. Our findings clarify when geometric corrections are beneficial or detrimental to non-adiabatic simulations using RPSH, providing practical guidance for atomistic condensed-phase applications.

How does an AI Weather Model Learn to Forecast Extreme Weather?
Rebecca Baiman, Elizabeth A. Barnes, Ankur Mahesh
Subjects:
Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics (physics.ao-ph)
In a warming climate with more frequent severe weather, artificial intelligence (AI) weather models have the potential to provide cheaper, faster, and more accurate forecasts of high- impact weather events. To realize this potential, there is a need for more research on how models learn extreme events and how that learning might be improved. We investigate how a spherical Fourier neural operator model (SFNO) learns extreme weather by saving every checkpoint throughout training and analyzing a collection of 9 extreme weather events including heatwaves, atmospheric rivers, and tropical cyclones. The SFNO learns heatwaves similarly to other weather days, but we find evidence that the model learns information about atmospheric river and tropical cyclone forecasts that it loses later in training. We propose a possible training strategy to improve the forecasting of extreme events by retaining information from earlier training checkpoints, and provide initial evidence of its utility.

Generalized Time-Reversal for Pulse Control in Diffusive Media
Rohin E. McIntosh, Arthur Goetschy, Alexey Yamilov, Nicholas Bender, Hasan Yilmaz, Hui Cao
Subjects:
Optics (physics.optics)
Time-reversal symmetry allows waves to retrace their paths through complex media and refocus at their origin. However, incomplete capture and reversal of scattered waves often limits pulse recompression. We address this challenge for spatially extended sources by introducing a generalized time-reversal framework, which identifies the optimal source pattern as the one that maximizes the energy of the waves that are captured and reversed. In a two-dimensional diffusive waveguide, we reconstruct the time-reversed wavefront corresponding to this optimal source using spatiospectral shaping, leading to a 35-fold enhancement in peak transmitted power compared to an unmodulated pulse. Internal spatiotemporal measurements reveal a ``loading and firing" process, in which energy accumulates within the medium and then is released abruptly. Moreover, time-reversing this burst enables deep energy delivery into the scattering medium. Generalized time-reversal opens new possibilities for short-pulse control in strongly-scattering media, with applications ranging from optogenetics to random laser amplification.

Space Physics (physics.space-ph)
We investigate energetic particle diffusion in the inner heliosphere (approximately 0.06-0.3 AU) explored by Parker Solar Probe (PSP). Parallel (kappa_parallel) and perpendicular (kappa_perp) diffusion coefficients are calculated using second-order quasi-linear theory (SOQLT) and unified nonlinear transport (UNLT) theory, respectively. PSP's in situ measurements of magnetic turbulence spectra, including sub-Alfvenic solar wind, are decomposed into parallel and perpendicular wavenumber spectra via a composite two-component turbulence model. These spectra are then used to compute kappa_parallel and kappa_perp across energies ranging from sub-GeV to GeV. Our results reveal a strong energy and radial distance dependence in kappa_parallel. While kappa_perp remains much smaller, it can increase in regions with relatively high turbulence levels delta B / B0. To validate our results, we estimate kappa_parallel using the upstream time-intensity profile of a solar energetic particle event observed by PSP and compare it with theoretical values from different diffusion models. Our results suggest that the SOQLT-calculated parallel diffusion generally shows better agreement with SEP intensity-derived estimates than the classic QLT model. This indicates that the SOQLT framework, which incorporates resonance broadening and nonlinear corrections and does not require an ad hoc pitch-angle cutoff, may provide a more physically motivated description of energetic particle diffusion near the Sun.

Artificial Thermalization in Ring-Polymer Molecular Dynamics: The Breakdown of RPMD for Gas-Phase Reactions with Pre-Reactive Complexes and How to Fix It
Joseph E. Lawrence, Jeremy O. Richardson
Comments:

Subjects:
Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph)
Ring-polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) has become a popular method for describing chemical reactions due to its ability to simultaneously capture tunneling, zero-point energy, anharmonicity and recrossing. Here we highlight that despite its many successes, great care must be taken when applying RPMD to study gas-phase reactions at low pressure. We show that for bimolecular reactions that proceed via pre-reactive complexes, RPMD predicts spuriously large rates at low temperatures and pressures. Using the rigorous connection of RPMD and semiclassical instanton theory, we demonstrate that this breakdown can be understood in terms of an intrinsic problem with RPMD: artificial thermalization. In the present context, this opens up reactive channels below the reactant asymptote that should be energetically inaccessible, resulting in erroneously large rates. We discuss practical strategies to overcome this problem by combining the steepest-descent inverse Laplace transform with Bleistein's uniform approximation to calculate the thermal rate given an appropriate lower energy bound.

A filter-dependent granular temperature model from large-scale CFD-DEM data
Lee Rosenberg, William Fullmer, Sarah Beetham
Subjects:
Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
The computational study of strongly-coupled, gas-solid flows at scales relevant to most environmental and engineering applications requires the use of `coarse-grained' methodologies such as the two-fluid model, particle-in-cell approach or the multiphase Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes equations. While these strategies enable computations at desirable length- and time-scales, they rely heavily on models to capture important flow physics that occur at scales smaller than the mesh. To date, the models that do exist are based on a limited set of flow conditions, such as very dilute particle phase. To this end, we leverage the most large-scale repository of CFD-DEM data to date to develop a filter-size dependent model for granular temperature--a key quantity for accurately predicting gas-solid flows. This filter-size dependence then translates directly to grid-size dependence in the context of coarse-grained approaches. In addition, we leverage the CFD-DEM dataset to propose an improved model for the mean variance in particle volume fraction, a quantity that characterizes the degree of clustering in the flow.

The Rapid Arrival of Josiah Willard Gibbs's Elementary Principles in Statistical Mechanics in European University Libraries
Hector Giacomini
Subjects:
History and Philosophy of Physics (physics.hist-ph)
This note offers an overview of how Josiah Willard Gibbs's Elementary Principles in Statistical Mechanics, published simultaneously in London and New York in 1902, spread through European university libraries. Contrary to the received idea that the circulation of this text was slow, information gathered through direct contacts with numerous academic libraries, together with an examination of Yale University's archives, reveals an unexpectedly rapid material diffusion beginning on 15 March 1902. This early propagation can be explained by several channels: presentation copies sent by Yale University to leading universities, personal mailings by Gibbs himself to prominent scientists, and the distribution of copies by the American publisher to major scientific journals.

Experimental Characterization and Simulation-Based Analysis of the RIT-2.5 Radiofrequency Ion Thruster

Subjects:
Accelerator Physics (physics.acc-ph); Applied Physics (physics.app-ph)
We report on the experimental characterization of the RIT-2.5 radiofrequency ion thruster, complemented by particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations to establish correlations between plasma parameters and extracted beam properties. The thruster was operated in a dedicated vacuum facility and equipped with optical spectroscopy, Faraday cup, and retarding field energy analyzer (RFEA) diagnostics. Electron temperature was determined from optical emission line ratios (Te about 3-7 eV), while the energy distribution of extracted ions was measured using the RFEA. A comparative simulation campaign was performed to reproduce the experimentally observed energy spectra and to extract plasma density values otherwise inaccessible due to the lack of intrusive diagnostics, yielding best-fit estimates of ne about 1.2x10E16 m-3. The results demonstrate that the energy spread of the extracted beam is strongly dependent on plasma density and electron temperature. The combined experimental-numerical approach provides a non-intrusive yet robust pathway for performance optimization of RF ion thrusters, offers validation benchmarks for advanced plasma simulation codes, and is particularly well-suited to compact micro-N-class thrusters for nanosatellite attitude and orbit control.

How are Scientific Concepts Birthed? Typing Rules of Concept Formation in Theoretical Physics Reasoning
Omar Aguilar, Anthony Aguirre
Comments:
28 pages, 2 figures
Subjects:
History and Philosophy of Physics (physics.hist-ph)
This work aims to formalize some of the ways scientific concepts are formed in the process of theoretical physics discovery. Since this may at first seem like a task beyond the scope of the exact sciences (natural and formal sciences), we begin by presenting arguments for why scientific concept formation can be formalized. Then, we introduce type theory as a natural and well-suited framework for this formalization. We formalize what we call "ways of discovering new concepts" including concept distinction, property preservation, and concept change, as cognitive typing rules. Next, we apply these cognitive typing rules to two case studies of conceptual discovery in the history of physics: Einstein's reasoning leading to the impossibility of frozen waves, and his conceptual path to the relativity of time. In these historical episodes, we recast what a physicist might informally call "ways of discovering new scientific concepts" as compositional typing rules built from cognitive typing rules - thus formalizing them as scientific discovery mechanisms. Lastly, we computationally model the type-theoretic reconstruction of Einstein's conceptual path to the relativity of time as a program synthesis task.

Optics (physics.optics)
We introduce multilayer structures based on phase-change materials for reconfigurable structural color generation. These structures can produce multiple distinct colors within a single pixel. Specifically, we design structures that generate either two or four maximally distinct structural colors. We employ a memetic optimization algorithm coupled with the impedance method to identify the optimal combination of materials and layer thicknesses that maximizes the distinctiveness of the generated colors. We demonstrate that our design approach achieves strong color contrast between the generated colors. The proposed multilayer design eliminates the need for subwavelength lithography, making it highly suitable for large-scale applications. Our results could lead to a new class of single-cell multicolor pixels which retain each color without power consumption, making them particularly appealing for low refresh rate displays.

Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph)
Accurately modeling chemical reactions at the atomistic level requires high-level electronic structure theory due to the presence of unpaired electrons and the need to properly describe bond breaking and making energetics. Commonly used approaches such as Density Functional Theory (DFT) frequently fail for this task due to deficiencies that are well recognized. However, for high-fidelity approaches, creating large datasets of energies and forces for reactive processes to train machine learning interatomic potentials or force fields is daunting. For example, the use of the unrestricted coupled cluster level of theory has previously been seen as unfeasible due to high computational costs, the lack of analytical gradients in many computational codes, and additional challenges such as constructing suitable basis set corrections for forces. In this work, we develop new methods and workflows to overcome the challenges inherent to automating unrestricted coupled cluster calculations. Using these advancements, we create a dataset of gas-phase reactions containing energies and forces for 3119 different organic molecules configurations calculated at the gold-standard level of unrestricted CCSD(T) (coupled cluster singles doubles and perturbative triples). With this dataset, we provide an analysis of the differences between the density functional and unrestricted CCSD(T) descriptions. We develop a transferable machine learning interatomic potential for gas-phase reactions, trained on unrestricted CCSD(T) data, and demonstrate the advantages of transitioning away from DFT data. Transitioning from training to DFT to training to UCCSD(T) datasets yields an improvement of more than 0.1 eV/Å in force accuracy and over 0.1 eV in activation energy reproduction.

Subjects:

We study light propagation in an array of periodically curved waveguides consisting of pairs of waveguides with out-of-phase oscillations of waveguide centers. We compute the corresponding Floquet propagation constants and find pseudocollapses where the Floquet bands shrink and, respectively, light diffraction is significantly inhibited. When, in addition, the refractive index of the waveguides in the array have quasiperiodic modulation in the transverse direction, we establish the existence of Floquet modes localized in the transverse direction and periodic in the longitudinal direction. With increase of the depth of quasiperiodic modulation of the refractive index in the array, the localized Floquet modes emerge near the pseudocollapse points of the periodic array. In array with sufficiently high frequencies of waveguide oscillations, the localized Floquet modes can exist even for weak quasiperiodic modulation which is situated below the localization transition in the array of straight waveguides.

A novel IR-SRGAN assisted super-resolution evaluation of photothermal coherence tomography for impact damage in toughened thermoplastic CFRP laminates under room temperature and low temperature

Applied Physics (physics.app-ph)
Evaluating impact-induced damage in composite materials under varying temperature conditions is essential for ensuring structural integrity and reliable performance in aerospace, polar, and other extreme-environment applications. As matrix brittleness increases at low temperatures, damage mechanisms shift: impact events that produce only minor delaminations at ambient conditions can trigger extensive matrix cracking, fiber/matrix debonding, or interfacial failure under severe cold loads, thereby degrading residual strength and fatigue life. Precision detection and quantification of subsurface damage features (e.g., delamination area, crack morphology, interface separation) are critical for subsequent mechanical characterization and life prediction. In this study, infrared thermography (IRT) coupled with a newly developed frequency multiplexed photothermal correlation tomography (FM-PCT) is employed to capture three-dimensional subsurface damage signatures with depth resolution approaching that of X-ray micro-computed tomography. However, the inherent limitations of IRT, including restricted frame rate and lateral thermal diffusion, reduce spatial resolution and thus the accuracy of damage size measurement. To address this, we develop a new transfer learning-based infrared super-resolution generative adversarial network (IR-SRGAN) that enhances both lateral and depth-resolved imaging fidelity based on limited thermographic datasets.

Applied Physics (physics.app-ph)
The thermal diffusivity measurement of impacted composites using pulsed methods presents an ill-posed inverse problem influenced by multiple factors such as sample thickness, cooling duration, and excitation energy. In this study, a novel excitation method, evaporative cryocooling, was introduced for measuring the thermal diffusivity of tested samples. Compared to conventional excitation modalities, evaporative cryocooling excitation is compact, portable, and low cost. However, evaporative cryocooling cannot be considered a pulsed method due to its prolonged excitation duration. In general, it is difficult to measure thermal diffusivity based on non-impulsive pulsed excitation at times commensurate with the pulse duration, often due to ill-defined pulse shape and width and the subsequent potentially complicated thermal response which may be subject to diffusive broadening. To address this challenge, inverse physics-informed neural networks (IPINNs) were introduced in this work and integrated with an evaporative cryocooling method. The Parker method combined with a photothermal method was employed as a reference. To improve the accuracy of both IPINNs and Parker methods, terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) was employed for measuring the thickness of impacted composites. Simulations and experimental results demonstrated the feasibility and accuracy of the IPINN-based approach.

Applied Physics (physics.app-ph)
Infrared thermography (IRT) and photothermal coherence tomography (PCT) exhibit potential in non-destructive testing and biomedical fields. However, the inevitable heat diffusion significantly affects the sensitivity and resolution of IRT and PCT. Conventional image processing techniques rely on capturing complete thermal sequences, which limits their ability to achieve real-time processes. Here, we construct a real-time super-resolution imaging system based on zero-shot learning strategy for the non-invasive infrared thermography and photothermal coherence tomography techniques. To validate the feasibility and accuracy of this super-resolution imaging system, IRT systems were employed to test several industrial samples and one biomedical sample. The results demonstrated high contrast in the region of interest (ROI) and uncovered valuable information otherwise obscured by thermal diffusion. Furthermore, three-dimensional photothermal coherence tomography was used to validate the excellent denoising and deconvolution capabilities of the proposed real-time super-resolution imaging system.

Subjects:
Optics (physics.optics)
Toroidal pulses, also known as Focused or Flying Doughnuts (FDs), are few-cycle pulses of doughnut-like topology. Originally proposed by Hellwarth and Nouchi in 1996, they have recently been experimentally realized. Toroidal pulses exhibit intriguing topological features, including skyrmionic field configurations and extensive regions of energy backflow, while their light-matter interactions have been associated with the excitation of toroidal and non-radiating modes in matter. The non-separable nature of toroidal pulses, encompassing both space-time and space-polarization couplings, positions them as promising candidates for robust information and energy transport. However, advancing their fundamental study and deployment in applications requires practical characterization methods, particularly with respect to their non-separability. In this work, we experimentally generate collimated optical toroidal pulses and analyze their space-polarization and space-time couplings using tomographic techniques. We quantify their degree of non-separability through measures such as concurrence and fidelity, benchmarking against ideal FD pulses. The reported results will be of interest to the fundamental study of toroidal pulses and spatiotemporal structured light more broadly, enabling applications in telecommunications, spectroscopy, metrology, and imaging.

Absorber of Topologically Structured Light

Subjects:
Optics (physics.optics)
Polarization- and wavelength-sensitive absorbers for homogeneous electromagnetic waves are crucial in photovoltaics, imaging and telecommunications. Here, we report on an absorber selective to the topological structure of light. An electromagnetic beam or pulse containing polarization singularities can be fully dissipated by the absorber, while plane waves are rejected regardless of their polarization. The absorber comprises a conical mirror coaxial with the incident propagating beam, which the mirror converts into a standing wave defined by the geometrical Pancharatnam-Berry phase accumulated upon reflection on the mirror. If a "nanowire" absorber is placed along the axis of the cone, singularly-polarized light can create an antinode of the standing wave at the absorber and nearly perfect dissipation of the light's energy is achievable regardless of the wavelength. The selective absorber of topologically structured light is of interest for energy harvesting, detection, filtering, and telecommunications applications.

The combination of two quarter-wave plates and one half-wave plate, regardless of their sequential arrangement, constitutes a well-established universal SU(2) gadget capable of implementing all polarization transformations on the standard Poincaré sphere. However, there is no analogous system for realizing all polarization transformations on the higher-order Poincaré sphere, a member of a higher topological index space. This work demonstrates that an optical gadget, comprising two quarter-wave $q$-plates and one half-wave $q$-plate, arranged in any order, is an SU(2) gadget to realize arbitrary polarization evolution on the higher-order Poincaré sphere.

Predictive Free Energy Simulations Through Hierarchical Distillation of Quantum Hamiltonians

Obtaining the free energies of condensed phase chemical reactions remains computationally prohibitive for high-level quantum mechanical methods. We introduce a hierarchical machine learning framework that bridges this gap by distilling knowledge from a small number of high-fidelity quantum calculations into increasingly coarse-grained, machine-learned quantum Hamiltonians. By retaining explicit electronic degrees of freedom, our approach further enables a faithful embedding of quantum and classical degrees of freedom that captures long-range electrostatics and the quantum response to a classical environment to infinite order. As validation, we compute the proton dissociation constants of weak acids and the kinetic rate of an enzymatic reaction entirely from first principles, reproducing experimental measurements within chemical accuracy or their uncertainties. Our work demonstrates a path to condensed phase simulations of reaction free energies at the highest levels of accuracy with converged statistics.

A semi-empirical model is presented for the thermalized temperature $T$ and mean momentum in the direction of laser propagation <$p_{fz}$> of electrons released from O$_{2}$ after the passage of a focused $800$ nm ultrashort pulsed laser pulse vs. peak laser intensity $I_{0}$ to provide initial conditions for electrodynamic fluid simulations. For this, theoretical kinetic energy spectra in different directions are modified with two adjustable parameters representing the effects of electron rescatter off its parent ion during the optical cycle subsequent to ionization. The classical kinematics of rescatter, in conjunction with the spectral fits, is used to estimate <$p_{fz}$>.

Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph)
Ji etal [New J. Phys. 26, 093014 (2024)] established a direct link between the photoionization cross section and the attosecond time delay near Cooper minima (CM) in the valence shells of noble-gas atoms. This link is based on the analytic properties of the ionization amplitude in the complex plane of the photoelectron energy, and is particularly sensitive to the winding number of the amplitude around the origin of the complex energy plane. Here, we demonstrate an analogous relation for photoionization of the valence $ns$ shells of alkali-metal atoms (AMA), from Na ($n=3$) to Cs ($n=6$), as well as alkaline-earth-metal atoms (AEMA), from Mg ($n=3$) to Ba ($n=6$). To this end, we employ a fully relativistic formalism that separates the two complementary $ns_{1/2} \to Ep_{1/2}$ and $Ep_{3/2}$ ionization channels. Each of these channels exhibits a phase variation close to $\pi$, but in opposite directions, near their respective Cooper minima. This phase variation vanishes in a nonrelativistic formulation, where the two channels become degenerate. For AMA, due to the threshold proximity of the CM, the universal Coulomb contribution to the time delay must be subtracted. The remaining component of the time delay is target-specific, angular-dependent, and accessible through comparative measurements.

Efficient particle sorting in microfluidic systems is vital for advancements in biomedical diagnostics and industrial applications. This study numerically investigates particle migration and passive sorting in symmetric serpentine microchannels, leveraging inertial and centrifugal forces for label-free, high-throughput separation. Using a two-dimensional numerical model, particle dynamics were analyzed across varying flow rates, diameter ratios (1.2, 1.5, and 2), and channel configurations. The optimized serpentine geometry achieved particle separation efficiencies exceeding 95% and throughput greater than 99%.A novel scaling framework was developed to predict the minimum number of channel loops required for efficient sorting. Additionally, the robustness of the proposed scaling framework is demonstrated by its consistency with findings from previous studies, which exhibit the same trend as predicted by the scaling laws, underscoring the universality and reliability of the model. Additionally, the study revealed the significant influence of density ratio ({\alpha}) on sorting efficiency, where higher {\alpha} values enhanced separation through amplified hydrodynamic forces. Optimal flow rates tailored to particle sizes were identified, enabling the formation of focused particle streaks for precise sorting. However, efficiency declined beyond these thresholds due to particle entrapment in micro-vortices or boundary layers. This work provides valuable insights and design principles for developing compact, cost-effective microfluidic systems, with broad applications in biomedical fields like cell sorting and pathogen detection, as well as industrial processes requiring precise particle handlin

Autonomous real-time control of turbulent dynamics

Subjects:
Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
Mastering turbulence remains one of physics' most intractable challenges, with its chaotic, multi-scale dynamics driving energy dissipation across transport and energy systems. Here we report REACT (Reinforcement Learning for Environmental Adaptation and Control of Turbulence), a fully autonomous reinforcement learning framework that achieves real-time, adaptive, closed-loop turbulence control in real-world environments. Deployed on a road vehicle model equipped solely with onboard sensors and servo-actuated surfaces, REACT learns directly from sparse experimental measurements in a wind tunnel environment, bypassing intractable direct numerical simulations and empirical turbulence models. The agent autonomously converges to a policy that reduces aerodynamic drag while achieving net energy savings. Without prior knowledge of flow physics, it discovers that dynamically suppressing spatio-temporally coherent flow structures in the vehicle wake maximizes energy efficiency, achieving two to four times greater performance than model-based baseline controllers. Through a physics-informed training that recasts data in terms of dimensionless physical groups and parametric input spaces, REACT synthesizes offline a single generalizable agent that transfers across speeds without retraining. These results move agentic learning beyond simulation to robust, interpretable real-world control of high-Reynolds turbulence, opening a path to self-optimizing physical systems in transport, energy and environmental flows.

The high gradients potentially achievable in distributed-coupling C-band photoinjectors make them attractive for many high brightness applications. Here we discuss optimization results for a 1.6 cell C-band photoinjector with a 240 MV/m peak field at the cathode that delivers a 250 pC electron bunch charge. We use a Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA), obtaining a Pareto front of emittance vs. bunch length. We also perform MOGA optimizations including an aperture to retain only a bright beam core. We find this reduces the emittance of the final beam by more than factor of 2 in some cases. For example, we find that at a root mean square bunch length of 1.6 ps, the use of an aperture improves the transverse emittance from 120 nm to 58 nm assuming negligible photocathode intrinsic emittance. The sacrificial charge at the periphery of the electron beam removed by the aperture linearizes the final slice phase space inside of the remaining beam core. The results obtained surpass the experimental state-of-the-art for beamlines with similar bunch charge.

Evolution has shaped animal bodies, yet to what extent biomechanical devices provide constraints and opportunities across different behaviors remains unclear. In birds, quiet breathing operates at a resonance of the respiratory biomechanics, but song, a behavior thought to be shaped by strong sexual selection, requires much higher breathing rates. Combining physiological recordings with a nonlinear biomechanical model, we show in canaries (Serinus canaria) that song production drives the system into a nonlinear regime that broadens the frequency range of amplified responses. This enhancement encompasses all syllabic rates, with an average magnification of ~94% of the theoretical maximum. Our results show that birds breathe and sing at a resonance, revealing that optimization strategies can be shared across behavioral states and extend to sexually selected displays.

Astrophysical observations suggest that magnetic reconnection in relativistic plasmas plays an important role in the acceleration of energetic particles. Modeling this accurately requires numerical schemes capable of addressing large scales and realistic magnetic field configurations without sacrificing the kinetic description needed to model particle acceleration self-consistently. We demonstrate the computational advantage of the relativistic semi-implicit method (RelSIM), which allows for reduced resolution while avoiding the numerical instabilities typically affecting standard explicit methods, helping to bridge the gap between macroscopic and kinetic scales. Two- and three-dimensional semi-implicit particle-in-cell simulations explore the linear tearing instability and the nonlinear development of reconnection and subsequent particle acceleration starting from a relativistic Harris equilibrium with no guide field. The simulations show that particle acceleration in the context of magnetic reconnection leads to energetic power-law spectra with cutoff energies, consistent with previous work done using explicit methods, but are obtained with a considerably reduced resolution.

We explore the possibility of the generation or amplification of macroscale magnetic fields and flows in a four-component astrophysical dusty plasma composed of mobile massless electrons and positrons, inertial positive ions and negatively charged static dust particles. The investigation demonstrates that when microscopic turbulent ambient plasma energy is predominantly kinetic, a straight dynamo (DY) mechanism is feasible. Conversely, a unified reverse-dynamo/dynamo (RDY/DY) mechanism is possible when the microscopic turbulent ambient plasma energy is primarily magnetic. Additionally, the evolution of Alfvén Mach numbers at the macro- and microscale are significantly affected by plasma species densities and invariant helicities. The potential implications of the present study for astrophysical settings are also highlighted.

Understanding the effect of wall elasticity in turbulent channel flows

Subjects:
Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
This study compares turbulent channel flows over elastic walls with those over rough walls, to explore the role of the dynamic change of shape of the wall on turbulence. The comparison is made meaningful by generating rough walls from instantaneous configurations of the elastic cases. The aim of this comparison is to individually understand the role of fluid-structure interaction effects and the role of wall shape/undulations in determining the overall physics of flow near elastic walls. With an increase in the compliance of the wall, qualitatively similar trends for many of the effects produced by a rough wall are also seen in the elastic wall. However, specific features can be observed for the elastic wall cases only, arising from the mutual interaction between the solid and fluid, leading to a further increase in drag. To understand them, we look at the turbulent structures, which exhibit clear differences across the various configurations: roughness induces only a slight reduction of streamwise coherency, resulting in a situation qualitatively similar to what is found in classical turbulent channel flows, whereas elasticity causes the emergence of a novel dominant spanwise coherency. Additionally, we explored the effect of vertical disturbances on elastic wall dynamics by comparing with permeable walls having similar (average) wall-normal velocity fluctuations at the interface. The permeable walls were found to have minimal similarities with elastic walls. Overall, we can state that the wall motion caused by the complex fluid-structure interaction contributes significantly to the flow and must be considered when modeling it. In particular, we highlight the emergence of strong wall-normal fluctuations near the wall, which result in strong ejection events, an attribute not observed for rigid walls.

The cooling storage ring external-target experiment is a large-scale nuclear physics experiment, which aims to study the physics of heavy-ion collisions at low temperatures and high baryon densities. A beam monitor (BM) is placed in the beam line to monitor the beam status and to improve the reconstruction resolution of the primary vertices. The radiation dose and particle fluence stemming from the beam interactions with gases and detector materials affect the performance of the sensors and electronics of BM. This paper uses FLUKA Monte Carlo code to simulate the radiation environment of BM detector. Radiation quantities including the total ionizing dose, 1 MeV neutron equivalent fluence, high-energy hadron flux, thermal neutron flux, and nuclear fragment flux are presented. Results of alternative simulation setups, including adding shielding layers inside the BM, are also investigated.

We investigate the conditions under which the Jacobi identity holds for a class of recently introduced anti-symmetric brackets for the hybrid plasma models with kinetic ions and massless electrons. In particular, we establish the precise conditions under which the brackets for the vector-potential-based formulations satisfy the Jacobi identity, and demonstrate that these conditions are fulfilled by all physically relevant functionals. Moreover, for the magnetic-field-based formulation, we show that the corresponding anti-symmetric bracket constitutes a Poisson bracket under the divergence-free condition of the magnetic field, and we provide a direct proof of the Jacobi identity. These results are further extended to models incorporating electron entropy as well as more general hybrid kinetic-fluid models.

We report the first successful production of a Cu-based Nb$_3$Sn sample specifically designed for Quadrupole Resonator (QPR) testing, representing a significant step toward scalable RF superconducting coatings of Nb$_3$Sn on copper substrates. The sample was fabricated using an optimized electrochemical thermal synthesis (ETS) via the bronze route, incorporating several key advancements: electropolishing of the Cu substrate, electroplating of the bronze precursor layer, a tailored heat treatment at approximately 700 $^\circ$C to promote grain growth and suppress tin-rich impurity phases, and a newly developed chemical etching procedure for effective removal of surface bronze residues and contaminants. These improvements address longstanding challenges in the fabrication of high-quality Cu-based Nb$_3$Sn thin films. Subsequent QPR measurements yielded the peak magnetic field and temperature dependent surface resistance $R_s$, as well as the superconducting transition temperature and quench field. Although the achieved RF performance -- characterized by a minimum $R_s$ of 43.4 n$\Omega$ at 4.5 K and 15 mT -- is not yet optimal, the results clearly demonstrate the feasibility of this approach and its potential for further enhancement through process refinement.

Geophysics (physics.geo-ph)
Rock geophysical properties are widely reported to exhibit non-linear behaviours under low-stress conditions (below 10-20 MPa) before transitioning to the linear elastic stage, primarily due to the closure of microcracks and grain interfaces. Image-based modelling of rock deformation struggles to effectively characterise the microcrack closure effect because of the partial-volume effect, where image voxels are larger than microcracks and contain both pore and solid phases. This study presents a novel method to simulate non-linear rock deformation under elevated stress conditions. The method reconstructs digital rock models by treating partial-volume voxels as transitional phases that incorporate microcracks. By assigning intermediate elastic moduli and assuming that the pore portion within each partial-volume voxel deforms before the remaining solid content, the method employs the finite element method to simulate rock deformation and calculate the porosity of the deformed model. The method is tested on two Bentheimer sandstone models, and the results demonstrate its ability to predict the non-linear changes in porosity and elastic properties as the effective stress increases. This work provides a new pathway for image-based modelling of non-linear rock deformation considering the microcrack closure effect, offering valuable insights into the complex mechanical behaviour of rocks under confinement.

A Geometrically Consistent Matching Framework for Side-Scan Sonar Mapping

Subjects:
Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det)
Robust matching of side scan sonar imagery remains a fundamental challenge in seafloor mapping due to view dependent backscatter, shadows, and geometric distortion. This paper proposes a novel matching framework that combines physical decoupling and geometric consistency to enhance correspondence accuracy and consistency across viewpoints. A self supervised multi branch network, derived from the Lambertian reflection model, decomposes raw sonar images into seabed reflectivity, terrain elevation, and acoustic path loss. The reflectivity map, serving as a stable matching domain, is used in conjunction with a training-free matching pipeline combining SuperPoint and MINIMA LightGlue. Geometry aware outlier rejection leverages both terrain elevation and its physically derived shadow map to further remove mismatches in acoustically occluded and topographically inconsistent regions, thereby improving registration accuracy. Quantitative and visual evaluations against traditional, CNN, and Transformer based state of the art methods demonstrate that our method achieves lower matching error, higher geometric consistency, and greater robustness to viewpoint variations. The proposed approach provides a data efficient, physically interpretable solution for high precision side scan sonar image matching in complex seafloor environments.

Subjects:
Geophysics (physics.geo-ph)
The oceanic mantle lithosphere has considerable potential to store chemically bound water, thereby being an important factor for the deep water cycle. However, the actual extent of hydrous alteration in such mantle rocks is debated. Geodynamic modeling has the potential to directly predict the extent of fluid flow through oceanic lithosphere, and, in turn, the extent of serpentinization. By comparing theory and numerical simulations, we demonstrate that conventional geodynamic models are inherently inconsistent with the physics of brittle deformation, and, as a result, they overestimate the extent of fluid flow during extension. In contrast to the extensive serpentinization often inferred with bending-related processes during subduction, limited serpentinization is consistent with theoretical predictions and geophysical observations.

This study established a quantum-classical hybrid framework that integrates quantum computing paradigm with meshfree finite particle method. By harnessing quantum superposition and entanglement, it hybridized the critical computational kernels (termed as quantum finite particle method). A resource-efficient quantum computational strategy on multi-partitioned zones was proposed, which leverages a fixed small-scale quantum circuit as a fundamental processing unit to handle inner product for arbitrarily sized arrays. This approach employs iterative nesting of the quantum-core operation to accommodate varying input dimensions while maintaining hardware feasibility throughout. Motivated with developed quantum framework, the novel numerical discretization for hybrid quantum computational particle dynamics can be derived commonly and applied in fluid flows. Through a sequence of numerical experiments purposefully, the proposed numerical model was thoroughly validated and analyzed. Results demonstrate that integrating quantum computing to hybridize conventional linear combinations of particle dynamics serves as an effective high performance computing paradigm. By further extending into the numerical investigation of viscoelastic, highly elastic, and purely elastic fluids under high Weissenberg number conditions, the applicability of quantum-hybrid framework is significantly broadened. These advances provide critical insights facilitating the transition of quantum-enhanced fluid simulation toward practical engineering applications.

Large-amplitude electrostatic fluctuations are routinely observed by spacecraft upon traversal of collisionless shocks in the heliosphere. Kinetic simulations of shocks have struggled to reproduce the amplitude of such fluctuations, complicating efforts to understand their influence on energy dissipation and shock structure. In this paper, 1D particle-in-cell simulations with realistic proton-to-electron mass ratio are used to show that in cases with upstream electron temperature $T_e$ exceeding the ion temperature $T_i$, the magnitude of the fluctuations increases with the electron plasma-to-cyclotron frequency ratio $\omega_{pe}/\Omega_{ce}$, reaching realistic values at $\omega_{pe}/\Omega_{ce} \gtrsim 30$. The large-amplitude fluctuations in the simulations are shown to be associated with electrostatic solitary structures, such as ion phase-space holes. In the cases where upstream temperature ratio is reversed, the magnitude of the fluctuations remains small.

Calorimeters operating in high-radiation environments are susceptible to damage, leading to increased noise that can significantly degrade energy resolution. A common way to mitigate noise is to apply a higher energy threshold on the cells, typically set a few standard deviations above the noise level. However, this method risks discarding cells with genuine energy deposits, worsening the energy resolution. In this paper we explore various machine learning (ML) algorithms that can replace a rigid threshold on the reconstructed cell energy and we demonstrate the improvement in calorimetric energy reconstruction and energy resolution that these ML methods can achieve in such challenging conditions.

The influence of extraterrestrial particles like cosmic radiation (CR) on the chemistry and ozone density in the Earth stratosphere is not well investigated and normally neglected in stratospheric chemistry models. Here we present the commissioning of a lab-based apparatus which aims at simulating conditions in the stratosphere in order to get better insight into the reactions induced by the secondary-particle showers from high-energetic CR which can reach low altitudes. Admixtures of ozone and the halocarbon CHClF2 (R22, chlorodifluoromethane) to atmospheric gases (N2, O2, Ar) were exposed to a glow discharge in the total pressure regime of a few hPa. According to the mass spectrometric analysis of the gas composition the discharge initiates significant ozone depletion by a factor four in the absence of R22. This depletion is strongly enhanced to two orders of magnitude in the presence of R22. The possible underlying reactions are discussed.

Accurate visualization of interventional devices, such as medical needles, is essential for the safe and effective guidance of minimally invasive procedures. Ultrasound (US) imaging is widely used for needle guidance, but the two-dimensional nature of most clinical probes limits accurate three-dimensional (3D) localization, particularly of the needle tip. We present a novel system that integrates volumetric US imaging with 3D needle tracking by combining a fiber-optic hydrophone embedded in the needle and a sparse spiral US array. Real-time volumetric imaging was achieved using plane-wave techniques, while precise needle tip tracking was enabled through communication between the probe and hydrophone. The feasibility of the approach was demonstrated using a nerve block training phantom.

The fermion sign problem constitutes a fundamental computational bottleneck across a plethora of research fields in physics, quantum chemistry and related disciplines. Recently, it has been suggested to alleviate the sign problem in \emph{ab initio} path integral Molecular Dynamics and path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) calculations based on the simulation of fictitious identical particles that are represented by a continuous quantum statistics variable $\xi$ [\textit{J.~Chem.~Phys.}~\textbf{157}, 094112 (2022)]. This idea facilitated a host of applications including the interpretation of an x-ray scattering experiment with strongly compressed beryllium at the National Ignition Facility [\textit{Nature Commun.}~\textbf{16}, 5103 (2025)]. In the present work, we express the original isothermal $\xi$-extrapolation method as a special case of a truncated Taylor series expansion around the $\xi=0$ limit of distinguishable particles. We derive new PIMC estimators that allow us to evaluate the Taylor coefficients up to arbitrary order and we carry out extensive new PIMC simulations of the warm dense electron gas to systematically analyze the sign problem from this new perspective. This gives us important insights into the applicability of the $\xi$-extrapolation method for different levels of quantum degeneracy in terms of the Taylor series radius of convergence. Moreover, the direct PIMC evaluation of the $\xi$-derivatives, in principle, removes the necessity for simulations at different values of $\xi$ and can facilitate more efficient simulations that are designed to maximize compute time in those regions of the full permutation space that contribute most to the final Taylor estimate of the fermionic expectation value of interest.

Implications of regional variations in climate change vulnerability and mitigation behaviour for social-climate dynamics

How regional heterogeneity in social and cultural processes drive--and respond to--climate dynamics is little studied. Here we present a coupled social-climate model stratified across five world regions and parameterized with geophysical, economic and social survey data. We find that support for mitigation evolves in a highly variable fashion across regions, according to socio-economics, climate vulnerability, and feedback from changing temperatures. Social learning and social norms can amplify existing sentiment about mitigation, leading to better or worse global warming outcomes depending on the region. Moreover, mitigation in one region, as mediated by temperature dynamics, can influence other regions to act, or just sit back, thus driving cross-regional heterogeneity in mitigation opinions. The peak temperature anomaly varies by several degrees Celsius depending on how these interactions unfold. Our model exemplifies a framework for studying how global geophysical processes interact with population-scale concerns to determine future sustainability outcomes.

Rydberg atoms, due to their large polarizabilities and strong transition dipole moments, have been utilized as sensitive electric field sensors. While their capability to detect modulated signals has been previously demonstrated, these studies have largely been limited to laboratory-generated signals tailored specifically for atomic detection. Here, we extend the practical applicability of Rydberg sensors by demonstrating the reception of real-world frequency-modulated (FM) audio transmissions using a consumer-grade handheld two-way radio operating in the UHF band. Detection is based on the AC Stark shift induced by the radio signal in a Rydberg atomic vapor, with demodulation performed using an offset local oscillator and lock-in amplification. We successfully demodulate speech signals and evaluate the audio spectral response and reception range. We show that all consumer-accessible radio channels can be simultaneously detected, and demonstrate simultaneous reception of two neighboring channels with at least 53 dB of isolation. This work underscores the potential of Rydberg atom-based receivers for practical, real-world FM signal detection.

Defending Saltwater Intrusion: The Freshwater Pushback

Subjects:
Geophysics (physics.geo-ph)
Saltwater Intrusion (SWI) threatens freshwater availability, agriculture, and ecosystem resilience in coastal regions. While sea-level rise (SLR) is a known driver of long-term salinization, the counteracting role of freshwater discharge remains underexamined. Here, we combine long-term observations with numerical modeling and machine learning reconstruction to quantify the buffering capacity of freshwater outflows across the U.S. coastline. In systems such as Delaware Bay and parts of the Gulf and South Atlantic coasts, the salt front has shifted seaward in recent decades, linked to increased discharge, despite SLR over that time period. We show that a 10 - 35% increase in freshwater flow can offset the salinity impact of 0.5 m of SLR, though regional variation is significant. With future discharge trends diverging spatially, SWI responses will be highly uneven. These results highlight the critical role of freshwater management in mitigating salinity risks under climate change, with implications for water resource resilience, coastal planning, and long-term adaptation strategies.

Mechanisms of isotope exchange between aqueous solutions and barite in low-temperature geochemical systems

Subjects:
Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph)
The prevailing view that solid-state diffusion is negligible at low temperatures is challenged by rapid sulfur and barium isotope exchange between natural barite crystals and aqueous solutions in laboratory experiments. This assumption relies on diffusivities extrapolated from high-temperature experiments. Here, isotope exchange rates were measured in solutions enriched with 137Ba and 32S at 50 and 80 oC for less than 10,360 hours. SIMS depth profiles revealed 137Ba enrichment to ~75 nm, with shapes characteristic of classical diffusion. Isotope disequilibrium between the barite surface and aqueous solution implies a continuous supply from the interior. These results indicate that defects and vacancies in barite and similar low-temperature minerals enable effective solid-state diffusion, with profound implications for paleoenvironmental reconstructions, materials science, and engineering.

Ultrafast optical modulation of vibrational strong coupling in ReCl(CO)$_3$(2,2-bipyridine)

Subjects:
Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph)
Polaritons - hybrid light-matter states formed from the strong coupling of a bright molecular transition with a confined photonic mode - may offer new opportunities for optical control of molecular behavior. Vibrational strong coupling (VSC) has been reported to impact ground-state chemical reactivity, but its influence on electronic excited-state dynamics remains unexplored. Here, we take a first step towards excited-state VSC by demonstrating optical modulation of the ReCl(CO)$_3$(bpy), (bpy = 2,2-bipyridine) complex under VSC using femtosecond ultraviolet (UV)-pump/infrared (IR)-probe spectroscopy. We establish ground-state VSC of ReCl(CO)$_3$(bpy) in a microfluidic Fabry-Pérot cavity equipped with indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated mirrors. ITO is effectively dichroic as it is reflective in the IR and transmissive in the UV-visible and therefore minimizes optical interference. Excitation with UV pump light drives ReCl(CO)$_3$(bpy) into a manifold of electronic excited states which subsequently undergo non-radiative relaxation dynamics. We probe the transient response of the strongly-coupled system in the mid-IR, observing both Rabi contraction and cavity-filtered excited state absorption signatures. We reconstruct the intrinsic response of intracavity molecules from the transient cavity transmission spectra to enable quantitative comparison with extracavity control experiments. We report no changes in the excited-state dynamics of ReCl(CO)$_3$(bpy) under ground-state VSC. However, we do observe significant amplification of transient vibrational signals due to classical cavity-enhanced optical effects. This effort lays the groundwork to pursue direct excited-state VSC aimed at modulating photochemical reactivity.

Subjects:
Applied Physics (physics.app-ph)
We report the development of a chromatic and spherical aberration corrector based on a combination of hexapole and quadrupole fields. Thick hexapole fields are used to generate negative spherical and to correct residual axial and off-axial aberrations. However, instead of using round transfer lenses placed between the hexapoles, a quadrupole multiplet producing superimposed electric and magnetic quadrupole fields is used to produce negative chromatic aberration. The quadrupole multiplet also functions as a transfer doublet within the corrector. In this paper, the simultaneous correction of chromatic and spherical aberrations using this corrector design is described and we demonstrate a resolution improvement in cases where the energy spread is limiting.

The impact of kinetic and global effects on ballooning 2nd stable pedestals of conventional and high aspect ratio tokamaks

Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph)
The EPED model [P.B. Snyder et al 2011 Nucl. Fusion 51 103016] had success in describing type-I ELM and QH-mode pedestals in conventional tokamaks, by combining kinetic ballooning mode (KBM) and peeling-ballooning (PB) constraints. Within EPED, the KBM constraint is usually approximated by the ideal ballooning mode (IBM) stability threshold. It has been noted that quantitative differences between local ideal MHD and gyro-kinetic (GK) ballooning stability can be larger at low aspect ratio. KBM critical pedestals are consistent with observation in initial studies on conventional and spherical tokamaks. In this work, the application of a reduced model for the calculation of the kinetic ballooning stability boundary is presented based on a novel and newly developed Gyro-Fluid System (GFS) code [G.M. Staebler et al 2023 Phys. Plasmas 30 102501]. GFS is observed to capture KBMs in DIII-D as well as the NSTX(-U) pedestals, opening the route for the integration of this model into EPED. Finally, high-n global ballooning modes are observed to limit local 2nd stability access and thus provide a transport mechanism that constrains the width evolution with beta_p,ped. The high-n global ballooning stability is approximated by its ideal MHD analogue using ELITE. It is shown that nearly local high-n with k_y*rho_s~1/2 modes can provide a proxy for the critical beta_p,ped when 2nd stable access exists on DIII-D plasmas. The use of GFS and ELITE scaling in EPED provided improved agreement in comparison to EPED1 with DIII-D pedestal data.

Imaging through volumetric scattering media by decoding angular light paths

Subjects:
Optics (physics.optics)
High-resolution optical microscopy has transformed biological imaging, yet its resolution and contrast deteriorate with depth due to multiple light scattering. Conventional correction strategies typically approximate the medium as one or a few discrete layers. While effective in the presence of dominant scattering layers, these approaches break down in thick, volumetric tissues, where accurate modeling would require an impractically large number of layers. To address this challenge, we introduce an inverse-scattering framework that represents the entire volume as a superposition of angular deflectors, each corresponding to scattering at a specific angle. This angular formulation is particularly well suited to biological tissues, where narrow angular spread due to the dominant forward scattering allow most multiple scattering to be captured with relatively few components. Within this framework, we solve the inverse problem by progressively incorporating contributions from small to large deflection angles. Applied to simulations and in vivo reflection-mode imaging through intact mouse skull, our method reconstructs up to 121 angular components, converting ~80% of multiply scattered light into signal. This enables non-invasive visualization of osteocytes in the skull that remain inaccessible to existing layer-based methods. These results establish the scattering-angle basis as a deterministic framework for imaging through complex media, paving the way for high-resolution microscopy deep inside living tissues.

Electron-positron colliders operating in the GeV region of center-of-mass energies or the Tau-Charm energy region, have been proven to enable competitive frontier research, due to its several unique features. With the progress of high energy physics in the last two decades, a new-generation Tau-Charm factory, Super Tau Charm Facility (STCF) has been actively promoting by the particle physics community in China. STCF holds great potential to address fundamental questions such as the essence of color confinement and the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe in the next decades. The main design goals of STCF are with a center-of-mass energy ranging from 2 to 7 GeV and a peak luminosity surpassing 5*10^34 cm^-2s^-1 that is optimized at a center-of-mass energy of 4 GeV, which is about 50 times that of the currently operating Tau-Charm factory - BEPCII. The STCF accelerator is composed of two main parts: a double-ring collider with the crab-waist collision scheme and an injector that provides top-up injections for both electron and positron beams. As a typical third-generation electron-positron circular collider, the STCF accelerator faces many challenges in both accelerator physics and technology. In this paper, the conceptual design of the STCF accelerator complex is presented, including the ongoing efforts and plans for technological R&D, as well as the required infrastructure. The STCF project aims to secure support from the Chinese central government for its construction during the 15th Five-Year Plan (2026-2030) in China.

Applied Physics (physics.app-ph)
Error correction is essential for modern computing systems, enabling information to be processed accurately even in the presence of noise. Here, we demonstrate a new approach which exploits an error correcting phase that emerges in a system of three coupled nonlinear resonators. Within this phase, perturbed memory states are autonomously restored via the collective dynamics of the nonlinear network. We implement our scheme using a network of nanomechanical resonators. Nanomechanical systems are an attractive platform for low energy computing, but purely mechanical error correction has not been previously demonstrated. We experimentally show that the error correcting phase provides a 35 times reduction in the rate of errors, and allows robust error correction over a wide range of system parameters. These results highlight how emergent nonlinear dynamics can be harnessed for practical applications, paving the way towards error-resilient nanomechanical computing.

Developing physically consistent closure models is a longstanding challenge in simulating plasma turbulence, even in minimal systems such as the two-field Hasegawa-Wakatani (HW) model, which captures essential features of drift-wave turbulence with a reduced set of variables. In this work, we leverage theoretical insights from Direct Interaction Approximation (DIA) to construct a six-term closure structure that captures the dominant turbulent transport processes, including both diffusion and hyper-diffusion. While the mathematical form of the closure is fully prescribed by DIA, the corresponding transport coefficients are learned from data using physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). The resulting Extended HW model with Closure (EHW-C) model reveals several nontrivial features of plasma turbulence: notably, some inferred coefficients become negative in certain regimes, indicating inverse transport, a phenomenon absent in conventional closure models. Moreover, the EHW-C model accurately reproduces the spectral and flux characteristics of high-resolution Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS), while requiring only one-eighth the spatial resolution per direction, yielding a tenfold speed-up. This work demonstrates how theory-guided machine learning can both enhance computational efficiency and uncover emergent transport mechanisms in strongly nonlinear plasma systems.

Erbium ($\text{Er}^{3+}$) emitters are relevant for optical applications due to their narrow emission line directly in the telecom C-band due to the ${}^\text{4}\text{I}_{\text{13/2}}$ $\rightarrow$ ${}^\text{4}\text{I}_{\text{15/2}}$ transition at 1.54 $\mu$m. Additionally they are promising candidates for future quantum technologies when embedded in thin-film silicon-on-insulator (SOI) to achieve fabrication scalability and CMOS compatibility. In this paper we integrate $\text{Er}^{3+}$ emitters in SOI metasurfaces made of closely spaced array of nanodisks, to study their spontaneous emission via room and cryogenic temperature confocal microscopy, off-resonance and in-resonance photoluminescence excitation at room temperature and time resolved spectroscopy. This work demonstrates the possibility to adopt CMOS-compatible and fabrication scalable metasurfaces for controlling and improving the collection efficiency of the spontaneous emission from the $\text{Er}^{3+}$ transition in SOI and could be adopted in similar technologically advanced materials.

A Phase Field Formulation of Frictional Sliding Contact for 3D Fully Eulerian Fluid Structure Interactions

Subjects:
Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph)
Frictional sliding contact in hydrodynamic environments can be found in a range of engineering applications. Accurate modeling requires an integrated numerical framework capable of resolving large relative motions, multiphase interactions, and nonlinear contact responses. Building on our previously developed fully Eulerian fluid structure formulation, we introduce a phase field based formulation for dynamic frictional contact in 3D. Contact detection is achieved via the overlap of diffuse interfaces of colliding solids. The normal contact response is defined as a volumetric body force proportional to the overlap parameter, while the tangential response is computed using the Coulomb friction model. The direction of the friction forces are derived by projecting phase-averaged relative velocities onto the local tangent plane of colliding bodies. This proposed unified treatment enables the computation of both normal and frictional forces within a single momentum balance equation, avoiding separate velocity fields for individual solids. We present several test cases with increasing complexity to verify and demonstrate our proposed frictional contact model. Verification against the Hertzian contact problem shows excellent agreement with the analytical solution, with errors below $3\%$ in the traction profile. In the sliding block benchmark, the computed displacement profiles closely follow the analytical solution for point-mass systems across multiple friction coefficients. The ironing problem demonstrates stable force predictions under finite deformation, with normal and tangential forces matching kinetic friction laws. The robustness and scalability of the proposed formulation are further demonstrated through a representative ship ice interaction scenario with free surface and frictional sliding effects.

Submarine cables play a critical role in global internet connectivity, energy transmission, and communication but remain vulnerable to accidental damage and sabotage. Recent incidents in the Baltic Sea highlighted the need for enhanced monitoring to protect this vital infrastructure. Traditional vessel detection methods, such as synthetic aperture radar, video surveillance, and multispectral satellite imagery, face limitations in real-time processing, adverse weather conditions, and coverage range. This paper explores Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) as an alternative by repurposing submarine telecommunication cables as large-scale acoustic sensor arrays. DAS offers continuous real-time monitoring, operates independently of cooperative systems like the "Automatic Identification System" (AIS), being largely unaffected by lighting or weather conditions. However, existing research on DAS for vessel tracking is limited in scale and lacks validation under real-world conditions. To address these gaps, a general and systematic methodology is presented for vessel detection and distance estimation using DAS. Advanced machine learning models are applied to improve detection and localization accuracy in dynamic maritime environments. The approach is evaluated over a continuous ten-day period, covering diverse ship and operational conditions, representing one of the largest-scale DAS-based vessel monitoring studies to date, and for which we release the full evaluation dataset. Results demonstrate DAS as a practical tool for maritime surveillance, with an overall F1-score of over 90% in vessel detection, and a mean average error of 141 m for vessel distance estimation, bridging the gap between experimental research and real-world deployment.

Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph)
We systematically investigate the calculation of excited states in quantum chemistry using auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC). Symmetry allows targeting of the lowest triplet excited states in AFQMC based on restricted open-shell determinants, effectively as a ground-state calculation. For open-shell singlet states, excited state calculations can be stabilized with the appropriate trial states, but their quality can have a larger effect on the accuracy in AFQMC. We find that active space-based configuration interaction trial states are often not sufficient to obtain accurate results. We instead use truncated equation of motion coupled cluster with single and double excitations (EOM-CCSD) as trial states. We benchmark the performance of these calculations on a set of small and medium molecules and polyacenes, focusing on predominantly single excitations. We find that the AFQMC results, obtained at a per-sample cost scaling of $O(N^6)$, are systematically more accurate than those obtained using EOM-CCSD, reducing excitation energy errors by approximately half for open-shell singlets. In regimes where EOM-CC triples are impractical, these results position AFQMC as a scalable, higher-accuracy complement for low-lying excited states.

Energy functions for pure and heterogenous systems are one of the backbones for molecular simulation of condensed phase systems. With the advent of machine learned potential energy surfaces (ML-PESs) a new era has started. Statistical models allow the representation of reference data from electronic structure calculations for chemical systems of almost arbitrary complexity at unprecedented detail and accuracy. Here, kernel- and neural network-based approaches for intramolecular degrees of freedom are combined with distributed charge models for long range electrostatics to describe the interaction energies of condensed phase systems. The main focus is on illustrative exam- ples ranging from pure liquids (dichloromethane, water) to chemically and structurally heterogeneous systems (eutectic liquids, CO on amorphous solid water), reactions (Men- shutkin), and spectroscopy (triatomic probes for protein dynamics). For all examples, small to medium-sized clusters are used to represent and improve the total interaction energy compared with reference quantum chemical calculations. Although remarkable accuracy can be achieved for some systems (chemical accuracy for dichloromethane and water), it is clear that more realistic models are required for van der Waals contribu- tions and improved water models need to be used for more quantitative simulations of heterogeneous chemical and biological systems.

This paper presents an extensive survey of the thermal radiation properties of lithium benzoate. We heated the sample from 313 to 553 K, just below the melting point, while performing an infrared spectroradiometry with an FT-IR spectrometer from 21 to 235 THz (700-7800 cm$^{-1}$). We have provided a detailed analysis of the infrared spectrum data and a comparison of the absorption spectrum of the same sample. It turned out that the recorded spectra are not only different from ordinary absorption spectra but also carry substantial information about the temperature dependence of the population of vibrationally excited states. We conclude by proposing a hypothesis on the thermal excitation mechanism of vibrational energy levels of molecules consistent with the distinct characteristics of the obtained infrared emission spectra.

Neural-network interatomic potentials (NNIPs) have transformed atomistic simulations, by enabling molecular dynamics simulations with near ab initio accuracy at reduced computational costs and improved scalability. Despite these advances, crafting NNIPs remains complex, demanding specialized expertise in both machine learning and electronic-structure calculations. Here, we introduce an automated, open-source, and user-friendly workflow that streamlines the creation of accurate NNIPs. Our approach integrates density-functional theory, data augmentation strategies and classical molecular dynamics to systematically explore the potential energy landscape. Our active-learning strategy leverages on-the-fly calibration of committee disagreement against true errors to ensure reliable uncertainty estimates. We use electronic-structure descriptors and dimensionality reduction to analyze the efficiency of our active learning strategy, which is shown to minimize both false positives and false negatives when deciding what to relabel with ab initio calculations. The method is validated on the fully automated training of a NNIP for a diverse set of carbon allotropes, reaching state-of-the-art accuracy and data efficiency. This platform democratizes NNIP development, empowering users to achieve high-precision simulations with minimal human intervention.

Harnessing quantum correlations between photons is an emerging direction in optical spectroscopy, but experimental progress has thus far been limited to fluorescence-detected studies of molecular systems at room temperature. Here, we demonstrate heralded emission detection (HED) under continuous-wave (CW) entangled-photon excitation of near-infrared (NIR)-emitting colloidal III-V quantum dots (QDs) at low temperatures. We use superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) and large-area NIR avalanche photodiodes (APDs) to maximize the time resolution ($\sim$70 ps) and emission count rates ($\sim$2000 cps). To our knowledge, these results represent the first demonstration of HED in the solid state and establish NIR QDs as a bright, tunable model system with longer-lived coherences and integrability with optical cavities as an additional experimental control knob.

Turbulent wind thrust control to reduce pitch motion of floating wind platforms with improved rotor operation

Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
For the dynamic analysis of floating offshore wind turbines (FOWTs) in realistic operating environment, this paper develops a coupled aero-hydro-mooring-servo model applicable to turbulent wind and irregular sea states with high computational efficiency. A modified rotor control strategy with platform motion feedback is proposed with a novel gain-scheduling technique to mitigate the negative damping effect on platform motions and decouple the rotor dynamics from the platform dynamics for better rotor operating performance. Firstly, the performance for the bottom-fixed wind turbine in steady uniform wind is validated and the turbulent wind tests show that using the rotor-disk-averaged wind speed for control is beneficial for reducing fluctuations of wind thrust and operational parameters compared with using the hub-height wind speed. For the FOWT, the negative damping phenomenon at above-rated wind speeds when using the baseline control is demonstrated through a range of wind and wave scenarios, and effects of control strategy and turbulent wind are investigated. The results indicate that the modified control strategy eliminates the negative damping effect on the platform pitch while maintaining small variations in rotor speed. Though the control including the blade pitch compensation from platform motion feedback with a constant gain can also eliminate the negative damping effect, it produces much larger fluctuations in rotor speed and causes larger overspeed exceeding the safety threshold of 20% at large wind speeds. Compared to steady wind, turbulent wind yields significantly larger low-frequency platform responses and increases the maximum rotor speed by 7.9% to 23.7% for the wind speeds considered.

Optics (physics.optics)
Photonic neuromorphic computing offers compelling advantages in power efficiency and parallel processing, but often falls short in realizing scalable nonlinearity and long-term memory. We overcome these limitations by employing silicon microring resonator (MRR) networks. These integrated photonic circuits enable compact, high-throughput neuromorphic computing by simultaneously exploiting spatial, temporal, and wavelength dimensions. This work advances the investigation of MRR networks for photonics-based machine learning (ML). We demonstrate the system's effectiveness on two widely used image classification benchmarks, MNIST and Fashion-MNIST, by encoding images directly into time sequences. In particular, we enhance the computational performance of a linear readout classifier within the reservoir computing paradigm through the strategic use of multiple physical output ports, diverse laser wavelengths, and varied input power levels. Moreover, we achieve substantially improved accuracies in a single-pixel classification setting without relying on digital memory, thanks to the inherent memory and parallelism of our MRR network.

This work describes a self-mixing-assisted optomechanical platform for transferring information between near- and mid-infrared radiation. In particular, the self-mixing signal of a mid-infrared quantum cascade laser is used to detect the oscillation of a membrane induced by radiation pressure exerted by a near-infrared excitation beam, which is amplitude-modulated at the membrane resonance frequency. This technique is, in principle, wavelength-independent and, therefore, can link different spectral regions from both the excitation and probe sides. This versatility can pave the way for future applications of this self-mixing-assisted optomechanical platform in communication and advanced sensing systems.

Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph)
The emergence of the Braess' paradox in road traffic systems demonstrates the positive effect of transportation planning in improving efficiency. By contrast, the phenomenon has rarely been examined in pedestrian evacuation traffic. Yet the possibility that Braess' paradox could lengthen evacuation times under hazardous conditions has received little systematic attention. In this paper, we investigate Braess' paradox in pedestrian evacuation traffic through a series of supervised experiments and corresponding traffic assignment models to examine its potential occurrence. Our empirical and modeling results indicate that Braess' paradox is unlikely to be a prevalent phenomenon in pedestrian traffic systems. Specifically, under autonomous evacuation and the assumption of complete network knowledge, the paradox does not arise in high-demand evacuation contexts in our case studies. Under a more realistic assumption of limited network knowledge, however, the paradox can occur. These findings highlight the importance of information conditions for evacuation performance and provide guidance for the design and management of large public venues.

Helical Core Formation and MHD Stability in ITER-Scale Plasmas with Fusion-born Alpha Particles

Subjects:
Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph)
The effect of fusion-born alpha particles on the helical core (HC), a long-lived ideal saturation state of the $m/n=1/1$ kink/quasi-interchange mode, is studied in the ITER-scale hybrid scenario where a core plasma has a low magnetic shear $q\gtrsim1$. The HC state is determined by 3-D MHD force balance and all factors that contribute to it, such as plasma shaping, the safety factor profile, and the pressure profiles of all particle species. An incomplete but useful measure of the HC is the displacement of the magnetic axis, $\delta_\mathrm{HC}$. Using MHD-PIC simulations, we find that $\delta_\mathrm{HC}$ is enhanced by increasing alpha particle pressure $\beta_\mathrm{\alpha}$. Within the ITER operating alpha pressure $\beta_\mathrm{\alpha}(0) \lesssim 1\%$, $\beta_\mathrm{\alpha}$ can be approximately treated as part of the total MHD pressure. In this regime, there is no notable flattening of the pressure profile, indicating that the HC preserves the omnigenity of the plasma. If one increases $\beta_\mathrm{\alpha}(0)$ beyond $1\%$, $\delta_\mathrm{HC}$ continues to increase with $\beta_\mathrm{\alpha}$ until it reaches an upper limit at $\beta_\mathrm{\alpha}(0)=3\%$ for our reference case. At this limit, both the bulk and alpha pressure profiles are partially flattened, indicating a reduction in omnigenity. After HC formation, a resistive pressure-driven MHD mode can become unstable, which is localized along the compressed magnetic flux region of the HC. This secondary mode consists of a broad spectrum of short-wavelength Fourier components that grow at same rates and are thus part of a single coherent entity. Our present simulation model is insufficient to adequately represent such a secondary mode; however, preliminary results suggest that it can facilitate magnetic chaos, which affects plasma confinement.

Medical Physics (physics.med-ph)
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the gold standard imaging modality for numerous diagnostic tasks, yet its usefulness is tempered due to its high cost and infrastructural requirements. Low-cost very-low-field portable scanners offer new opportunities, while enabling imaging outside conventional MRI suites. However, achieving diagnostic-quality images in clinically acceptable scan times remains challenging with these systems. Therefore methods for improving the image quality while reducing the scan duration are highly desirable. Here, we investigate a physics-informed 3D deep unrolled network for the reconstruction of portable MR acquisitions. Our approach includes a novel network architecture that utilizes momentum-based acceleration and leverages complex conjugate symmetry of k-space for improved reconstruction performance. Comprehensive evaluations on emulated datasets as well as 47mT portable MRI acquisitions demonstrate the improved reconstruction quality of the proposed method compared to existing methods.

Subjects:
Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph)
Chemical reaction optimisation is essential for synthetic chemistry and pharmaceutical development, demanding the extensive exploration of many reaction parameters to achieve efficient and sustainable processes. We report $\alpha$-PSO, a novel nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithm that augments canonical particle swarm optimisation (PSO) with machine learning (ML) for parallel reaction optimisation. Unlike black-box ML approaches that obscure decision-making processes, $\alpha$-PSO uses mechanistically clear optimisation strategies through simple, physically intuitive swarm dynamics directly connected to experimental observables, enabling practitioners to understand the components driving each optimisation decision. We establish a theoretical framework for reaction landscape analysis using local Lipschitz constants to quantify reaction space "roughness", distinguishing between smoothly varying landscapes with predictable surfaces and rough landscapes with many reactivity cliffs. This analysis guides adaptive $\alpha$-PSO parameter selection, optimising performance for different reaction topologies. Systematic evaluation of $\alpha$-PSO across pharmaceutically relevant reaction benchmarks demonstrates competitive performance with state-of-the-art Bayesian optimisation methods, while two prospective high-throughput experimentation (HTE) campaigns showed that $\alpha$-PSO identified optimal reaction conditions more rapidly than Bayesian optimisation. $\alpha$-PSO combines the predictive capability of advanced black-box ML methods with interpretable metaheuristic procedures, offering chemists an effective framework for parallel reaction optimisation that maintains methodological clarity while achieving highly performant experimental outcomes. Alongside our open-source $\alpha$-PSO implementation, we release $989$ new high-quality Pd-catalysed Buchwald-Hartwig and Suzuki reactions.

Biological Physics (physics.bio-ph)
Adhesion-independent migration is a prominent mode of cell motility in confined environments, yet the physical principles that guide such movement remain incompletely understood. We present a phase-field model for simulating the motility of deformable, non-adherent cells driven by contractile surface instabilities of the cell cortex. This model couples surface and bulk hydrodynamics, accommodates large shape deformations and incorporates a diffusible contraction-generating molecule (myosin) that drives cortical flows. These capabilities enable a systematic exploration of how mechanical cues direct cell polarization and migration. We first demonstrate that spontaneous symmetry breaking of cortical activity can lead to persistent and directed movement in channels. We then investigate how various physical cues - including gradients in friction, viscosity, and channel width as well as external flows and hydrodynamic interactions between cells - steer migration. Our results show that active surface dynamics can generate stimulus-specific cell behaviors, such as migration up friction gradients or escape from narrow regions. Beyond cell migration, the model offers a versatile platform for exploring the mechanics of active surfaces in biological systems.

Spatiotemporal dynamics of moiré excitons in van der Waals heterostructures

Subjects:

Heterostructures of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) offer unique opportunities in optoelectronics due to their strong light-matter interaction and the formation of dipolar interlayer excitons. Introducing a twist angle or lattice mismatch between layers creates a periodic moiré potential that significantly reshapes the energy landscape and introduces a high-dimensional complexity absent in aligned bilayers. Recent experimental advances have enabled direct observation and control of interlayer excitons in such moiré-patterned systems, yet a microscopic theoretical framework capturing both their thermalization and spatiotemporal dynamics remains lacking. Here, we address this challenge by developing a predictive, material-specific many-body model that tracks exciton dynamics across time, space, and momentum, fully accounting for the moiré potential and the complex non-parabolic exciton band structure. Surprisingly, we reveal that flat bands, which typically trap excitons, can significantly enhance exciton propagation. This counterintuitive behavior emerges from the interplay between the flat-band structure giving rise to a bottleneck effect for exciton relaxation and thermal occupation dynamics creating hot excitons. Our work not only reveals the microscopic mechanisms behind the enhanced propagation but also enables the control of exciton transport via twist-angle engineering. These insights lay the foundation for next-generation moiré-based optoelectronic and quantum technologies.

Sun-induced fluorescence (SIF) as a close remote sensing based proxy for photosynthesis is accepted as a useful measure to remotely monitor vegetation health and gross primary productivity. In this work we present the new retrieval method WAFER (WAvelet decomposition FluorEscence Retrieval) based on wavelet decompositions of the measured spectra of reflected radiance as well as a reference radiance not containing fluorescence. By comparing absolute absorption line depths by means of the corresponding wavelet coefficients, a relative reflectance is retrieved independently of the fluorescence, i.e. without introducing a coupling between reflectance and fluorescence. The fluorescence can then be derived as the remaining offset. This method can be applied to arbitrary chosen wavelength windows in the whole spectral range, such that all the spectral data available is exploited, including the separation into several frequency (i.e. width of absorption lines) levels and without the need of extensive training datasets. At the same time, the assumptions about the reflectance shape are minimal and no spectral shape assumptions are imposed on the fluorescence, which not only avoids biases arising from wrong or differing fluorescence models across different spatial scales and retrieval methods but also allows for the exploration of this spectral shape for different measurement setups. WAFER is tested on a synthetic dataset as well as several diurnal datasets acquired with a field spectrometer (FloX) over an agricultural site. We compare the WAFER method to two established retrieval methods, namely the improved Fraunhofer line discrimination (iFLD) method and spectral fitting method (SFM) and find a good agreement with the added possibility of exploring the true spectral shape of the offset signal and free choice of the retrieval window.

A high-performance elliptic solver for plasma boundary turbulence codes

Subjects:
Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph)
Elliptic equations play a crucial role in turbulence models for magnetic confinement fusion. Regardless of the chosen modeling approach - whether gyrokinetic, gyrofluid, or drift-fluid - the Poisson equation and Ampère's law lead to elliptic problems that must be solved on 2D planes perpendicular to the magnetic field. In this work, we present an efficient solver for such generalised elliptic problems, especially suited for the conditions in the boundary region. A finite difference discretisation is employed, and the solver is based on a flexible generalised minimal residual method (fGMRES) with a geometric multigrid preconditioner. We present implementations with OpenMP parallelisation and GPU acceleration, with backends in CUDA and HIP. On the node level, significant speed-ups are achieved with the GPU implementation, exceeding external library solutions such as rocALUTION. In accordance with theoretical scaling laws for multigrid methods, we observe linear scaling of the solver with problem size, $O(N)$. This solver is implemented in the PARALLAX/PAccX libraries and serves as a central component of the plasma boundary turbulence codes GRILLIX and GENE-X.

Scale-by-scale kinetic energy budgets in multiphase turbulence
Fabien Thiesset, Jonathan Vahé
Subjects:
Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
The present work aims at exploring the scale-by-scale kinetic energy exchanges in multiphase turbulence. For this purpose, we derive the Kármán-Howarth-Monin equation which accounts for the variations of density and viscosity across the two phases together with the effect of surface tension. We consider both conventional and phase conditional averaging operators. This framework is applied to numerical data from detailed simulations of forced homogeneous and isotropic turbulence covering different values for the liquid volume fraction, the liquid/gas density ratio, the Reynolds, and Weber numbers. We confirm the existence of an additional transfer term due to surface tension. Part of the kinetic energy injected at large scales is transferred into kinetic energy at smaller scales by classical non-linear transport while another part is transferred to surface energy before being released back into kinetic energy, but at smaller scales. The overall kinetic energy transfer rate is larger than in single phase flows. Kinetic energy budgets conditioned in a given phase show that the scale-by-scale transport of turbulent kinetic energy due to pressure is a gain (loss) of kinetic energy for the lighter (heavier) phase. Its contribution can be dominant when the gas volume fraction becomes small or when the density ratio increases. Building on previous work, we hypothesize the existence of a pivotal scale above which kinetic energy is stored into surface deformation and below which the kinetic energy is released by interface restoration. Some phenomenological predictions for this scale are discussed.

Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph)
Predicting and interpreting thermal performance under oscillating flow in porous structures remains a critical challenge due to the complex coupling between fluid dynamics and geometric features. This study introduces a data-driven wGAN-LBM-Nested_CV framework that integrates generative deep learning, numerical simulation based on the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM), and interpretable machine learning to predict and explain the thermal behavior in such systems. A wide range of porous structures with diverse topologies were synthesized using a Wasserstein generative adversarial network with gradient penalty (wGAN-GP), significantly expanding the design space. High-fidelity thermal data were then generated through LBM simulations across various Reynolds (Re) and Strouhal numbers (St). Among several machine learning models evaluated via nested cross-validation and Bayesian optimization, XGBoost achieved the best predictive performance for the average Nusselt number (Nu) (R^2=0.9981). Model interpretation using SHAP identified the Reynolds number, Strouhal number, porosity, specific surface area, and pore size dispersion as the most influential predictors, while also revealing synergistic interactions among them. Threshold-based insights, including Re > 75 and porosity > 0.6256, provide practical guidance for enhancing convective heat transfer. This integrated approach delivers both quantitative predictive accuracy and physical interpretability, offering actionable guidelines for designing porous media with improved thermal performance under oscillatory flow conditions.

Accessibility is essential for designing inclusive urban systems. However, the attempt to capture the complexity of accessibility in a single universal metric has often limited its effective use in design, measurement, and governance across various fields. Building on the work of Levinson and Wu, we emphasise that accessibility consists of several key dimensions. Specifically, we introduce a conceptual framework that defines accessibility through three main dimensions: Proximity (which pertains to active, short-range accessibility to local services and amenities), Opportunity (which refers to quick access to relevant non-local resources, such as jobs or major cultural venues), and Value (which encompasses the overall quality and personal significance assigned to specific points of interest). While it is generally beneficial to improve accessibility, different users and contexts present unique trade-offs that make a one-size-fits-all solution neither practical nor desirable. Our framework establishes a foundation for a quantitative and integrative approach to modelling accessibility. It considers the complex interactions among its various dimensions and facilitates more systematic analysis, comparison, and decision-making across diverse contexts.

Electrically tunable linear dichroism (LD) with non-volatile properties represents a critical yet elusive feature for next-generation integrated photonic elements in practical device architectures. Here, we demonstrate record-breaking, non-volatile control of optical anisotropy in two-dimensional ReS2 via ferroelectric gating with aluminum scandium nitride (AlScN). Our ferroelectric field-effect transistors achieve near-unity (~95%) LD tunability of differential reflectance at room temperature--the highest reported for any electrically controlled 2D optical system. Crucially, the programmed optical states exhibit exceptional retention exceeding 12,000 seconds without applied bias, enabling true non-volatile optical memory. Through combined experimental characterization and ab initio calculations, we reveal that ferroelectric polarization switching induces substantial asymmetric charge transfer to ReS2, selectively populating conduction band states and triggering structural distortions that dramatically enhance optical anisotropy in the "up" polarization state while leaving the "down" state unperturbed. This ferroelectric-semiconductor coupling provides a universal platform for voltage-programmable, energy-efficient photonic devices with dynamic polarization control, addressing critical needs in integrated photonics as well as programmable far-field optics and telecommunications infrastructure.

Silicon carbide (SiC) has been widely adopted in the semiconductor industry, particularly in power electronics, because of its high temperature stability, high breakdown field, and fast switching speeds. Its wide band gap makes it an interesting candidate for radiation-hard particle detectors in high-energy physics and medical applications. Furthermore, the high electron and hole drift velocities in 4H-SiC enable devices suitable for ultra-fast particle detection and timing applications. However, currently, the front-end readout electronics used for 4H-SiC detectors constitute a bottleneck in investigations of the charge carrier drift. To address these limitations, a high-frequency readout board with an intrinsic bandwidth of 10 GHz was developed. With this readout, the transient current signals of a 4H-SiC diode with a diameter of 141 $\mathrm{\mu m}$ and a thickness of 50 $\mathrm{\mu m}$ upon UV-laser, alpha particle, and high-energy proton beam excitation were recorded. In all three cases, the electron and hole drift can clearly be separated, which enables the extraction of the charge carrier drift velocities as a function of the electric field. These velocities, for the first time directly measured, provide a valuable comparison to Monte-Carlo simulated literature values and constitute an essential input for TCAD simulations. Finally, a complete simulation environment combining TCAD, the Allpix$^2$ framework, and SPICE simulations is presented, in good agreement with the measured data.

This study investigates the feasibility of tilt-series neutron tomography for analyzing rhizoboxes used in root-soil interaction studies. Traditional neutron imaging methods are limited by constrained root growth volumes and poor penetration in moist soil. Using a vertical acquisition axis, the tilt-series approach avoids constraints typical of laminography. This method allows simultaneous radiographic and tomographic data acquisition, enhancing time resolution and providing detailed insights into root networks and soil water content. Experiments involved scanning six-week-old maize plants in rhizoboxes filled with sand. Results show that tilt-series tomography can effectively reconstruct root networks despite some artifacts from the missing wedge. While the tilt-series tomographic data qualitatively reveal water distribution changes, radiographic data remain essential for quantitative analysis. This approach demonstrates the potential for dynamic root-soil interaction studies, offering a valuable tool for agricultural and environmental research by providing comprehensive insights into the rhizosphere.

Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det)
This paper proposes a new detector concept that uses the decoupling of superconducting Cooper pairs to detect particles, which has a theoretical energy threshold at the sub-meV level. However, quasiparticles decoupled from Cooper pairs in superconductors is difficult to detect using conventional photoelectric devices, since the binding energy of Cooper pairs is at the sub-meV scale. A key challenge is reading out quasiparticle signals at cryogenic temperatures. Therefore, we firstly investigate the performance of silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) at a cryogenic temperature of 10~mK, and observed that the dark count rate drops by seven orders of magnitude compared to room temperature, while the gain decreases by only a factor of 4.44. In this paper, we present a comprehensive characterization of the SiPM's performance at 10~mK, including breakdown voltage, second breakdown and operating voltage range, single-photoelectron gain and resolution, dark count rate, output waveform characteristics, and the probability of correlated signals. Based on these findings, we propose a conceptual framework for a sub-meV particle detector that uses electron multiplication in a PN junction for signal readout.

Probabilistic modelling of atmosphere-surface coupling with a copula Bayesian network

Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics (physics.ao-ph); Applications (stat.AP)
Land-atmosphere coupling is an important process for correctly modelling near-surface temperature profiles, but it involves various uncertainties due to subgrid-scale processes, such as turbulent fluxes or unresolved surface heterogeneities, suggesting a probabilistic modelling approach. We develop a copula Bayesian network (CBN) to interpolate temperature profiles, acting as alternative to T2m-diagnostics used in numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems. The new CBN results in (1) a reduction of the warm bias inherent to NWP predictions of wintertime stable boundary layers allowing cold temperature extremes to be better represented, and (2) consideration of uncertainty associated with subgrid-scale spatial variability. The use of CBNs combines the advantages of uncertainty propagation inherent to Bayesian networks with the ability to model complex dependence structures between random variables through copulas. By combining insights from copula modelling and information entropy, criteria for the applicability of CBNs in the further development of parameterizations in NWP models are derived.

Rheological Insights from the Oscillation Dynamics of Viscoelastic Sessile Drops

Subjects:
Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
This study investigates the oscillation behavior of a sessile drop placed on a hydrophobic substrate subjected to vertical vibrations with varying frequencies and amplitudes. We examined the responses of both Newtonian and viscoelastic drops. For viscoelastic samples, image analysis techniques were employed to correlate the drop dynamics with the rheological properties of the material. Overall, we demonstrate that this drop-based method allows for oscillatory shear experiments at frequencies that are difficult to access using conventional rheometers. The results reveal that the essential features of the drop response can be explained by the ratio of two characteristic time scales: the internal polymer relaxation time ($t_{p}$) and the external forcing time scale ($1/f$). This ratio defines the Deborah number ($De$). When the two time scales are comparable ($De \approx 1$), viscous dissipation dominates, which is observed in Lissajous curves and the drop's profile. At very low Deborah numbers ($De \ll 1$), the drop behaves like a Newtonian fluid (having a peak around natural frequency of the drop), while at high Deborah numbers ($De \gg 1$), it exhibits an elastic response. Furthermore, we show that increasing the applied deformation drives the system into the nonlinear viscoelastic regime. In this regime, unlike traditional rheology measurements, we observe the presence of $even$ and $odd$ harmonics in the drop response. This is attributed to the inherent geometric asymmetry of the drop setup, which breaks the symmetric assumptions typically present in standard rheological techniques.

We demonstrate a grazing-incidence x-ray platform that simultaneously records time-resolved grazing-incidence small-angle x-ray scattering (GISAXS) and grazing-incidence x-ray diffraction (GID) from a femtosecond laser-irradiated gold film above the melting threshold, with picosecond resolution at an x-ray free-electron laser (XFEL). By tuning the x-ray incidence angle, the probe depth is set to tens of nanometers, enabling depth-selective sensitivity to near-surface dynamics. GISAXS resolves ultrafast changes in surface nanomorphology (correlation length, roughness), while GID quantifies subsurface lattice compression, grain orientation, melting, and recrystallization. The approach overcomes photon-flux limitations of synchrotron grazing-incidence geometries and provides stringent, time-resolved benchmarks for complex theoretical models of ultrafast laser-matter interaction and warm dense matter. Looking ahead, the same depth-selective methodology is well suited to inertial confinement fusion (ICF): it can visualize buried-interface perturbations and interfacial thermal resistance on micron to sub-micron scales that affect instability seeding and burn propagation.

Turbulent mixers have been widely used in industrial settings for chemical production and increasingly for therapeutic nanoparticle formulation by antisolvent precipitation. The quality of the product is closely related to the fluid and mixing dynamics inside the mixers. Due to the rapid time scales and small sizes of many turbulent mixing geometries, computational fluid dynamics simulations have been the primary tool used to predict and understand fluid behavior within these mixers. In this study, we used the residual-based variational multiscale finite element method to perform high-fidelity turbulent simulations on two commonly used turbulent mixers: the multi-inlet vortex mixer (MIVM) and the confined impinging jets mixer (CIJM). We simulated two geometric variations, two-inlets and four-inlets, of the MIVM and two different inflow ratios of the CIJM. Through detailed turbulence results, we identify differences in turbulence onset, total energy, and mixing performance of the two MIVM configurations. With the CIJM results, we demonstrate the effect of the flow rate ratio on the impingement behavior, and as a result, on the mixing performance and turbulence. The cross-comparison between the two mixers shows key differences in turbulence and mixing behaviors, such as the turbulence onset, the energy decay, and the output mixing index. This study demonstrates the importance of a high-accuracy numerical scheme in simulating the turbulent mixers and understanding the similarities and differences among mixers. Furthermore, the results show potential for optimizing the operating conditions to achieve the best mixing performance.

Accelerator Physics (physics.acc-ph)
While the prediction of AC losses during transients is critical for designing large-scale low-temperature superconducting (LTS) magnets, brute-force finite-element (FE) simulation of their detailed geometry down to the length scale of the conductors is a computational challenge. Multi-scale methods, balancing between a coarse approximation of the fields at the scale of the magnet and a detailed description at the scale of the conductors, are promising approaches to reduce the computational load while keeping a sufficient accuracy. In this work, we introduce a neural network approach to accelerate multi-scale magneto-thermal simulations of LTS magnets by replacing costly single-turn FE models with neural network surrogates. The neural network architecture is presented and discussed, together with an automated procedure for generating simulation data for its training. The resulting accelerated multi-scale model is used to simulate current ramp-up procedures for the IBA S2C2 magnet. The surrogate-based multi-scale model is compared with a conventional multi-scale model based on a composite wire-in-channel FE model. The surrogate model is shown to reproduce single-turn filament hysteresis, inter-filament coupling, and eddy losses, while the computational time of the multi-scale method is reduced by a factor of 800.

Nuclear physics is a very abstract field with little accessibility for wider audiences, and yet it is a field of physics with far reaching implications for everyday life. The Nuclear Beavers demonstration is a hands-on experience that offers an intuitive lens into nuclear structure and decay. We aim to provide a more accessible entry point for students and educators by substituting complex nuclear structures and interactions with tactile building blocks following well-defined rules, thereby opening nuclear physics concepts to the general public.

Subjects:
Optics (physics.optics)
We demonstrate an integrated photonic circuit based on feed forward photonic meshes that can be programmed and reconfigured to perform arbitrary spectral filter functions. We investigate a subset of the available filter functions, demonstrating that a N = 4 input triangular mesh with M = 3 layers may be operated via self-configuration algorithms to filter M arbitrary wavelengths from a given input spectrum. The tunable nature of the architecture enables preconfigured filter functions to be swept in the spectral domain continuously over the free spectral range of the device. This removes any strict requirements between the design parameters of the architecture and the center wavelength of a desired filter function. With this architecture, we experimentally demonstrate arbitrary wavelength rejection filters with contrasts as deep as 40 dB. Further, by intentionally selecting the center wavelengths of each filter function to lie along a wavelength grid we demonstrate deep wavelength division demultiplexing (DWDM) with inter-channel crosstalk between -25 dB and -40 dB. Unlike typical DWDM systems, in this architecture the center wavelength of each channel is not fixed at fabrication and instead may be swept or reordered arbitrarily. This device demonstrates advantages over typical methods for DWDM, Raman spectroscopy, and correlation spectroscopy as well as other applications.

We examine the propagation dynamics of such novel waves and reveal the key factors that lead to angular acceleration. Moreover, we propose a two-color scheme that makes it possible to generate dynamically twisting light, an optical analog of a drill, that can rotate at THz frequencies.

The power spectrum of compressible turbulence: A story in symmetries

Subjects:
Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)
This article presents a theoretical study of the scaling properties of the kinetic energy spectrum in compressible turbulence. From the fundamental symmetries and linear trans- formations of the microscopic action, we derive exact relations between the correlation functions and their generators. These relations put strong constraints on the possible scaling relations in the system as a function of scale. One of the main results of this study is that the action can be split between an incompressible part, which is the same as in the usual stochastic Navier-Stokes theory whatever the value of the Mach number, and a longitudinal part, whose behavior is to be compared to the three dimensional Burgers equation, which presents a much richer phase diagram as its usually discussed one dimensionalcounterpart.

Cold atoms are promising platforms for metrology and quantum computation, yet their many-body dynamics remains largely unexplored. We here investigate Rabi oscillations from optically-thick cold clouds, driven by high-intensity coherent light. A dynamical displacement from the atomic resonance is predicted, which can be detected through the collective Rabi oscillations of the atomic ensemble. Different from linear-optics shifts, this dynamical displacement grows quadratically with the optical depth, yet it reduces with increasing pump power as dipole-dipole interactions are less effective. This modification may be particularly important for Ramsey spectroscopy, when strong pulses and optically dense samples are used.

Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics (physics.ao-ph)
Understanding controls on Mesoscale Convective Systems (MCSs) is critical for predicting rainfall extremes across scales. Spatial variability of soil moisture (SM) presents such a control, with $\sim$200km dry patches in the Sahel observed to intensify mature MCSs. Here we test MCS sensitivity to spatial scales of surface heterogeneity using a framework of experiments initialised from scale-filtered SM. We demonstrate the control of SM heterogeneity on MCS populations, and the mechanistic chain via which spatial variability propagates through surface fluxes to convective boundary layer development and storm environments. When all sub-synoptic SM variability is homogenised, peak MCS counts drop by 23%, whereas maintaining small-scale variability yields a weaker decrease due to higher primary initiation. In sensitivity experiments, boundary layer development prior to MCSs is similar to that over mesoscale dry SM anomalies, but instead driven by diffuse cloud-free slots of increased shortwave radiation. This reduces storm numbers and potential predictability.

Arrays of neutral atoms present a promising system for quantum computing, quantum sensors, and other applications, several of which would profit from the ability to load, cool, and image the atoms in a finite magnetic field. In this work, we develop a technique to image and prepare $^{87}$Rb atom arrays in a finite magnetic field by combining EIT cooling with fluorescence imaging. We achieve 99.6(3)% readout fidelity at 98.2(3)% survival probability and up to 68(2)% single-atom stochastic loading probability. We further develop a model to predict the survival probability, which also agrees well with several other atom array experiments. Our technique cools both the axial and radial directions, and will enable future continuously-operated neutral atom quantum processors and quantum sensors.

Superresolving Non-linear PDE Dynamics with Reduced-Order Autodifferentiable Ensemble Kalman Filtering For Turbulence Modeling and Flow Regulation

Subjects:
Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
Accurately reconstructing and forecasting high-resolution (HR) states from computationally cheap low-resolution (LR) observations is central to estimation-and-control of spatio-temporal PDE systems. We develop a unified superresolution pipeline based on the reduced-order autodifferentiable Ensemble Kalman filter (ROAD-EnKF). The method learns a low-dimensional latent dynamics model and a nonlinear decoder from latent variables to HR fields; the learned pair is embedded in an EnKF, enabling simultaneous state estimation and control-oriented forecasting with quantified uncertainty. We evaluate on three benchmarks: 1-D viscous Burgers equation (shock formation), Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) equation (chaotic dynamics), and 2-D Navier-Stokes-Kraichnan turbulence (NSKT) (vortex decaying dynamics at Re 16,000). LR data are obtained by factors of 4-8 downsampling per spatial dimension and are corrupted with noise. On Burgers and KS, the latent models remain stable far beyond the observation window, accurately predicting shock propagation and chaotic attractor statistics up to 150 steps. On 2-D NSKT, the approach preserves the kinetic-energy spectrum and enstrophy budget of the HR data, indicating suitability for control scenarios that depend on fine-scale flow features. These results position ROAD-EnKF as a principled and efficient framework for physics-constrained superresolution, bridging LR sensing and HR actuation across diverse PDE regimes.

We present laboratory results from supercritical, magnetized collisionless shock experiments ($M_A \lesssim 10$, $\beta\sim 1$). We report the first observation of fully-developed shocks ($R=4$ compression ratio and a downstream region decoupled from the piston) after seven upstream ion gyration periods. A foot ahead of the shock exhibits super-adiabatic electron and ion heating. We measure the electron temperature $T_e = 115$ eV and ion temperature $T_i = 15$ eV upstream of the shock; whereas, downstream, we measure $T_e=390$ eV and infer $T_i=340$ eV, consistent with both Thomson scattering ion-acoustic wave spectral broadening and Rankine-Hugoniot conditions. The downstream electron temperature has a $30$-percent excess from adiabatic and collisional electron-ion heating, implying significant collisionless anomalous electron heating. Furthermore, downstream electrons and ions are in equipartition, with a unity electron-ion temperature ratio $T_e/T_i = 1.2$.

Geometric interpretation of the hyperfine Breit--Rabi solution
Lihong V. Wang
Subjects:
Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph)
We present a geometric interpretation of the hyperfine Breit--Rabi eigenvalues and eigenvectors in alkali atoms after reformulating the standard solution into a compact form. In this picture, the nuclear magnetic moment has a polar angle fixed by the total projection quantum number. In contrast, the electron magnetic moment anti-aligns or aligns with an effective field formed by both the external magnetic flux density and the nuclear field, which simultaneously sets the mixing angle of the eigenvectors. This geometric view offers intuitive insight into the structure of the solutions.

Conservative-dissipative dynamics are ubiquitous across a variety of complex open systems. We propose a data-driven two-phase method, the Moment-DeepRitz Method, for learning drift decompositions in generalized diffusion systems involving conservative-dissipative dynamics. The method is robust to noisy data, adaptable to rough potentials and oscillatory rotations. We demonstrate its effectiveness through several numerical experiments.

Describing the world behavior through mathematical functions help scientists to achieve a better understanding of the inner mechanisms of different phenomena. Traditionally, this is done by deriving new equations from first principles and careful observations. A modern alternative is to automate part of this process with symbolic regression (SR). The SR algorithms search for a function that adequately fits the observed data while trying to enforce sparsity, in the hopes of generating an interpretable equation. A particularly interesting extension to these algorithms is the Multi-view Symbolic Regression (MvSR). It searches for a parametric function capable of describing multiple datasets generated by the same phenomena, which helps to mitigate the common problems of overfitting and data scarcity. Recently, multiple implementations added support to MvSR with small differences between them. In this paper, we test and compare MvSR as supported in Operon, PySR, phy-SO, and eggp, in different real-world datasets. We show that they all often achieve good accuracy while proposing solutions with only few free parameters. However, we find that certain features enable a more frequent generation of better models. We conclude by providing guidelines for future MvSR developments.

Contextuality, Holonomy and Discrete Fiber Bundles in Group-Valued Boltzmann Machines
Jean-Pierre Magnot
Subjects:
Machine Learning (cs.LG); Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability (physics.data-an); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
We propose a geometric extension of restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) by allowing weights to take values in abstract groups such as \( \mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{R}) \), \( \mathrm{SU}(2) \), or even infinite-dimensional operator groups. This generalization enables the modeling of complex relational structures, including projective transformations, spinor dynamics, and functional symmetries, with direct applications to vision, language, and quantum learning.
A central contribution of this work is the introduction of a \emph{contextuality index} based on group-valued holonomies computed along cycles in the RBM graph. This index quantifies the global inconsistency or "curvature" induced by local weights, generalizing classical notions of coherence, consistency, and geometric flatness. We establish links with sheaf-theoretic contextuality, gauge theory, and noncommutative geometry, and provide numerical and diagrammatic examples in both finite and infinite dimensions.
This framework opens novel directions in AI, from curvature-aware learning architectures to topological regularization in uncertain or adversarial environments.

Mesh-based graph neural networks (GNNs) have become effective surrogates for PDE simulations, yet their deep message passing incurs high cost and over-smoothing on large, long-range meshes; hierarchical GNNs shorten propagation paths but still face two key obstacles: (i) building coarse graphs that respect mesh topology, geometry, and physical discontinuities, and (ii) maintaining fine-scale accuracy without sacrificing the speed gained from coarsening. We tackle these challenges with M4GN, a three-tier, segment-centric hierarchical network. M4GN begins with a hybrid segmentation strategy that pairs a fast graph partitioner with a superpixel-style refinement guided by modal-decomposition features, producing contiguous segments of dynamically consistent nodes. These segments are encoded by a permutation-invariant aggregator, avoiding the order sensitivity and quadratic cost of aggregation approaches used in prior works. The resulting information bridges a micro-level GNN, which captures local dynamics, and a macro-level transformer that reasons efficiently across segments, achieving a principled balance between accuracy and efficiency. Evaluated on multiple representative benchmark datasets, M4GN improves prediction accuracy by up to 56% while achieving up to 22% faster inference than state-of-the-art baselines.

Nonclassical Driven-Dissipative Dynamics in Collective Quantum Optics

PhD Thesis, 311 pages, 107 figures
Subjects:
Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Optics (physics.optics)
Reduced abstract. This Thesis explores emergent cooperative phenomena in collective light-matter systems. We study ensembles of interacting quantum emitters coherently driven by a laser field and coupled to photonic structures, focusing on the hybrid description of emitters dressed by light. The interplay among quantum emitters, coherent driving, and photonic environments reveals a rich landscape of cooperative effects. While single-emitter dressing has been widely studied, we address collective phenomena in two non-identical emitters modelled as two-level systems. Strong interaction forms a dimer exhibiting superradiant and subradiant states, with two-photon resonances directly connecting ground and doubly excited states. This nonlinear process, central to the Thesis, enables new regimes of cooperative light-matter physics. Analytical studies show how interactions reshape observables such as emission intensity, photon statistics, and spectra, offering implications for quantum metrology. The sensitivity of two-photon processes to emitter distance and driving strength enables high-precision sensing and sub-wavelength imaging. Unexpectedly, we find that off-resonant virtual states may gain population through dissipation, redefining their role in open systems. To capture this, we develop a hierarchical adiabatic elimination method for metastable dynamics. We also analyze entanglement in emitters coupled to a lossy cavity, identifying five mechanisms, including the frequency-resolved Purcell effect introduced here. This selective enhancement stabilizes cooperative states and enables scalable entanglement. Our models, tailored to solid-state platforms such as quantum dots and molecular aggregates, address challenges like inhomogeneous broadening and decoherence, demonstrating the feasibility of harnessing cooperative light-matter effects for quantum technologies.

Comments:

Subjects:
Quantum Physics (quant-ph); History and Philosophy of Physics (physics.hist-ph)
In this work we address the contemporary debate about quantum individuality expressed as an opposition between those who, like Décio Krause, defend the reference of the theory to "non-individual particles", and those like Dennis Dieks, who propose instead to preserve the notion of "classical particle" as commonly applied by contemporary physicists. We will argue that these viewpoints rather than truly opposed share a common methodology which has helped to reinforce the doctrine of classical concepts that was imposed by Bohr and Dirac within the "standard" formulation --which remains the orthodox physical account of the theory of quanta. We will also discuss a recently proposed relativist yet objective relational account of quantum individuality [25] which, going back to Einstein's methodological approach, opens the doors to a completely new, truly realist understanding of quantum individuality.

Liquid mixtures can separate into phases with distinct composition. This phenomenon has recently come back to prominence due to its role in complex biological liquids, such as the cytoplasm, which contain thousands of components. For simple two-component mixtures phase-separated states are global free energy minima. However, local free energy minima, i.e. metastable states, are known to play a dominant role in complex systems with many components. For example, Hopfield neural networks can retrieve information from partial cues via relaxation to metastable states. Under what conditions can phase separated states be metastable, and what are the implications for information processing in multicomponent liquids? In this work we develop the general thermodynamic formalism of metastable phase separation. We then apply this formalism to an illustrative toy example inspired by recent experiments, binary mixtures with high-order interactions. Finally, as core application of the formalism, we study metastability in Hopfield liquids, a class of multicomponent mixtures capable of storing information on the composition of phases. We show that these phases can be retrieved from partial cues via metastable phase separation. Spatial simulations of liquids with a large number of components match our analytical solution. Our work suggests that complex biological mixtures can perform information retrieval through metastable phase separation.

We consider an inverse problem governed by the Westervelt equation with linear diffusivity and quadratic-type nonlinearity. The objective of this problem is to recover all the coefficients of this nonlinear partial differential equation. We show that, by constructing complex-valued time-periodic solutions excited from the boundary time-harmonically at a sufficiently high frequency, knowledge of the first- and second-harmonic Cauchy data at the boundary is sufficient to simultaneously determine the wave speed, diffusivity and nonlinearity in the interior of the domain of interest.

Policies focused on deep decarbonization of regional economies emphasize electricity sector decarbonization alongside electrification of end-uses. There is growing interest in utilizing hydrogen (H2) produced via electricity to displace fossil fuels in difficult-to-electrify sectors. One such case is heavy-duty vehicles (HDV), which represent a substantial and growing share of transport emissions as light-duty vehicles electrify. Here, we assess the bulk energy system impact of decarbonizing the HDV segment via either H2, or drop-in synthetic liquid fuels produced from H2 and CO2. Our analysis soft-links two modeling approaches: (a) a bottom-up transport demand model producing a variety of final energy demand scenarios for the same service demand and (b) a multi-sectoral capacity expansion model that co-optimizes power, H2 and CO2 supply chains under technological and policy constraints to meet exogenous final energy demands. Through a case study of Western Europe in 2040 under deep decarbonization constraints, we quantify the energy system implications of different levels of H2 and synthetic fuels adoption in the HDV sector under scenarios with and without CO2 sequestration. In the absence of CO2 storage, substitution of liquid fossil fuels in HDVs is essential to meet the deep decarbonization constraint across the modeled power, H2 and transport sectors. Additionally, utilizing H2 HDVs reduces decarbonization costs and fossil liquids demand, but could increase natural gas consumption. While H2 HDV adoption reduces the need for direct air capture (DAC), synthetic fuel adoption increases DAC investments and total system costs. The study highlights the trade-offs across transport decarbonization pathways, and underscores the importance of multi-sectoral consideration in decarbonization studies.

With rapid progress being made in the development of platforms for quantum computation, there has been considerable interest in whether present-day and near-term devices can be used to solve problems of relevance. A commonly cited application area is the domain of quantum chemistry. While most experimental demonstrations of quantum chemical calculations on quantum devices have focused on the ground-state electronic energy of the system, other properties of the ground-state, such as the electric dipole moment, are also of interest. Here we employ the quantum computed moments (QCM) method, based on the Lanczos cluster expansion, to estimate the dipole moment of the water molecule on an IBM Quantum superconducting quantum device. The noise-mitigated results agree with full configuration interaction (FCI) calculations to within 0.03 $\pm$ 0.007 debye (2% $\pm$ 0.5%), compared to direct expectation value determination (i.e. VQE) with errors on the order of 0.07 debye (5%), even when the VQE calculation is performed without noise. This demonstrates that moments-based energy estimation techniques can be adapted to noise-robust evaluation of non-energetic ground-state properties of chemical systems.

The controlled assembly of solid-state spins with nanoscale spatial precision is an outstanding challenge for quantum technology. Here, we combine DNA-based patterning with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) ensemble quantum sensors in diamond to form and sense programmable 2D arrays of spins. We use DNA origami to control the spacing of chelated Gd$^{3+}$ spins, as verified by the observed linear relationship between proximal NVs' relaxation rate, $1/T_1$, and the engineered number of Gd$^{3+}$ spins per origami unit. We further show that DNA origami provides a robust way of functionalizing the diamond surface with spins as it preserves the charge state and spin coherence of proximal, shallow NV centers. Our work enables the formation and interrogation of ordered, strongly interacting spin networks with applications in quantum sensing and quantum simulation. We quantitatively discuss the prospects of entanglement-enhanced metrology and high-throughput proteomics.

Simplex-structured matrix factorization (SSMF) is a common task encountered in signal processing and machine learning. Minimum-volume constrained unmixing (MVCU) algorithms are among the most widely used methods to perform this task. While MVCU algorithms generally perform well in an offline setting, their direct application to online scenarios suffers from scalability limitations due to memory and computational demands. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes an approach which can build upon any off-the-shelf MVCU algorithm to operate sequentially, i.e., to handle one observation at a time. The key idea of the proposed method consists in updating the solution of MVCU only when necessary, guided by an online check of the corresponding optimization problem constraints. It only stores and processes observations identified as informative with respect to the geometrical constraints underlying SSMF. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach when analyzing synthetic and real datasets, showing that it achieves estimation accuracy comparable to the offline MVCU method upon which it relies, while significantly reducing the computational cost.

Total Variation Subgradient Guided Image Fusion for Dual-Camera CASSI System

Spectral imaging technology has long-faced fundamental challenges in balancing spectral, spatial, and temporal reso- lutions. While compressive sensing-based Coded Aperture Snapshot Spectral Imaging (CASSI) mitigates this trade-off through optical encoding, high compression ratios result in ill-posed reconstruction problems. Traditional model-based methods exhibit limited performance due to reliance on handcrafted inherent image priors, while deep learning approaches are constrained by their black-box nature, which compromises physical interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose a dual-camera CASSI reconstruction framework that integrates total variation (TV) subgradient theory. By es- tablishing an end-to-end SD-CASSI mathematical model, we reduce the computational complexity of solving the inverse problem and provide a mathematically well-founded framework for analyzing multi-camera systems. A dynamic regular- ization strategy is introduced, incorporating normalized gradient constraints from RGB/panchromatic-derived reference images, which constructs a TV subgradient similarity function with strict convex optimization guarantees. Leveraging spatial priors from auxiliary cameras, an adaptive reference generation and updating mechanism is designed to provide subgradient guidance. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively preserves spatial-spectral structural consistency. The theoretical framework establishes an interpretable mathematical foundation for computational spectral imaging, demonstrating robust performance across diverse reconstruction scenarios.

The efficacy of a communication network hinges upon both its physical architecture and the protocols that are employed within it. In the context of quantum communications, there exists a fundamental rate-loss tradeoff for point-to-point quantum channels such that the rate for distributing entanglement, secret keys, or quantum states decays exponentially with respect to transmission distance. Quantum networks are the solution to overcome point-to-point limitations, but they simultaneously invite a challenging open question: How should quantum networks be designed to effectively and efficiently guarantee high rates? Now that performance and physical topology are inexorably linked, this question is not easy, but the answer is essential for a future quantum internet to be successful. In this work, we offer crucial insight into this open question for complex optical-fiber quantum networks. Using realistic descriptions of quantum networks via random network models and practical end-to-end routing protocols, we reveal critical phenomena associated with large-scale quantum networks. Our work reveals the weaknesses of applying single-path routing protocols within quantum networks, observing an inability to achieve reliable rates over long distances. Adapting novel algorithms for multi-path routing, we employ an efficient and practical multi-path routing algorithm capable of boosting performance while minimizing costly quantum resources.

Molecular dynamics simulations using a Gaussian Approximation Potential (GAP) reveal a stress triaxiality driven, two-step Si-I (diamond cubic) to Si-V (simple hexagonal) phase transition pathway in a spherical Si nanoparticle with a 10 nm diameter under triaxial compression. A transient amorphous phase first forms at the surface and propagates inward around Si-I core, where stress triaxiality is low (shear-dominated). Within the amorphous shell, the material recrystallizes into Si-V at locations of elevated stress triaxiality and hydrostatic pressure. The resulting Si-V structure transforms into a fully amorphous state upon unloading. A subsequent loading-unloading cycle applied to this amorphous nanoparticle reveals a reversible amorphous to Si-V transformation, demonstrating a nanoscale phase memory effect.

Establishing a mapping between nanocatalysts structure and their catalytic properties is essential for efficient design. To this end, we demonstrate the accuracy of a general machine learning framework on a representative and challenging application: predicting the mass activity of Pt nanoparticles for the electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction, estimated via a microkinetic model. Accurate models are obtained when leveraging either a nanocatalyst's structure representation accessible at the computational level, namely the surface site generalized coordination number distributions, or one accessible experimentally, namely the nanoparticle's pair distance distribution function. Building on this result, we demonstrate that our machine learning model, in tandem with Bayesian optimization, efficiently identifies the Top-10 and Top-100 most active structures out of a large pool of candidates comprising more than 50000 different structures, after probing the activity only of a few thousand structures. These findings provide a robust blueprint for accelerated theoretical and experimental identification of active nanocatalysts.

We study the transport of active Brownian particles (ABPs) in three-dimensional (3D) oscillatory geometries, which are spatially periodic. We establish a generalized Fick-Jacobs approach, which reduces a 3D system to an effective 1D system based on the assumption that a fast equilibration of particles along the transversal directions of the geometry. The transport characteristics of ABPs are computed semi-analytically and corroborated by numerical simulations. At the optimal frequency of the geometry oscillation, particles exhibit higher average velocity $\langle v \rangle$ and effective diffusion coefficient $D_{\text{eff}}$, resembling the phenomena of stochastic resonance. This effect is further enhanced by the self-propelled velocity of ABPs and the amplitude of geometry oscillations. These findings have significant implications for the development of micro- and nanofluidic devices with enhanced control over particle transport and precise manipulation of small-scale biomedical devices.

A time-splitting Fourier pseudospectral method for the Wigner(-Poisson)-Fokker-Planck equations

In this article, we propose an efficient time-splitting Fourier pseudospectral method for the Wigner(-Poisson)-Fokker-Planck equations. The method achieves second-order accuracy in time and spectral accuracy in phase space, both of which are rigorously verified by numerical experiments. The validated scheme is then employed to study the long-time dynamics of these systems. We investigate the existence of steady states for both the Wigner-Fokker-Planck and Wigner-Poisson-Fokker-Planck equations. Notably, for the Wigner-Fokker-Planck system, our results provide numerical evidence for the existence of a steady state even when the external potential is far from harmonic. This is an important discovery, since this phenomenon has not been thoroughly established in theory.

We introduce PINGS (Physics-Informed Neural Network for Fast Generative Sampling), a framework that amortizes diffusion sampling by training a physics-informed network to approximate reverse-time probability-flow dynamics, reducing sampling to a single forward pass (NFE = 1). As a proof of concept, we learn a direct map from a 3D standard normal to a non-Gaussian Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). PINGS preserves the target's distributional structure (multi-bandwidth kernel $MMD^2 = 1.88 \times 10^{-2}$ with small errors in mean, covariance, skewness, and excess kurtosis) and achieves constant-time generation: $10^4$ samples in $16.54 \pm 0.56$ millisecond on an RTX 3090, versus 468-843 millisecond for DPM-Solver (10/20) and 960 millisecond for DDIM (50) under matched conditions. We also sanity-check the PINN/automatic-differentiation pipeline on a damped harmonic oscillator, obtaining MSEs down to $\mathcal{O}(10^{-5})$. Compared to fast but iterative ODE solvers and direct-map families (Flow, Rectified-Flow, Consistency), PINGS frames generative sampling as a PINN-style residual problem with endpoint anchoring, yielding a white-box, differentiable map with NFE = 1. These proof-of-concept results position PINGS as a promising route to fast, function-based generative sampling with potential extensions to scientific simulation (e.g., fast calorimetry).

Role of magnetic shear distribution on the formation of eruptive flux ropes

Erupting flux ropes play crucial role in powering a wide range of solar transients, including flares, jets, and coronal mass ejections. These events are driven by the release of stored magnetic energy, facilitated by the shear in the complex magnetic topologies. However, the mechanisms governing the formation and eruption of flux ropes, particularly the role of magnetic shear distribution in coronal arcades are not fully understood. We employ magnetohydrodynamic simulations incorporating nonadiabatic effects of optically thin radiative losses, magnetic field-aligned thermal conduction, and spatially varying (steady) background heating, to realistically model the coronal environment. A stratified solar atmosphere under gravity is initialized with a non-force-free field comprising sheared arcades. We study two different cases by varying the initial shear to analyze their resulting dynamics, and the possibility of flux rope formation and eruptions. Our results show that strong initial magnetic shear leads to spontaneous flux rope formation and eruption via magnetic reconnection, driven by Lorentz force. The shear distribution infers the non-potentiality distributed along arcades and demonstrates its relevance in identifying sites prone to eruptive activity. The evolution of mean shear and the relative strength between guide to reconnection fields during the pre- and post-eruption phases are explored, with implications of bulk heating for the ``hot onset'' phenomena in flares, and particle acceleration. On the other hand, the weaker shear case does not lead to formation of any flux ropes. Our findings highlight the limitations of relying solely on foot point shear and underscore the need for coronal scale diagnostics. These results are relevant for understanding eruptive onset conditions and can promote a better interpretation of coronal observations from current and future missions.

IGA-LBM: Isogeometric lattice Boltzmann method
Ye Ji, Monica Lacatus, Matthias Möller
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA); Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
The lattice Boltzmann method has become a widely adopted approach in computational fluid dynamics, offering unique advantages in mesoscopic kinetic modeling, intrinsic parallelism, and simple treatment of boundary conditions. However, its conventional reliance on Cartesian grids fundamentally limits geometric fidelity in flows involving curved boundaries, introducing stair-step artifacts that propagate as spurious forces and boundary-layer inaccuracies.
To address these challenges, we propose the isogeometric lattice Boltzmann method, which seamlessly integrates Isogeometric Analysis with LBM, leveraging the geometric precision of non-uniform rational B-Splines to construct body-fitted computational grids. Unlike conventional Cartesian-based LBM, the proposed approach eliminates stair-step boundary artifacts by providing sub-element geometric accuracy while maintaining the efficiency of LBM. Furthermore, the higher-order continuity of NURBS improves gradient resolution, reducing numerical diffusion in high-Reynold's-number flows. The parametric grid adaptation of IGA enables $h$-, $p$-, and $k$-refinement strategies, allowing for localized resolution enhancement in boundary layers and regions with high solution gradients. Additionally, the diffeomorphic mapping properties of IGA ensure intrinsic conservation, preserving advection invariants and suppressing numerical oscillations, leading to enhanced stability.
Benchmark simulations on flows with curved and complex geometries demonstrate that IGA-LBM delivers significantly more accurate boundary-layer predictions and pressure/force estimates than standard Cartesian LBM, while preserving its computational efficiency and scalability. By combining geometric exactness with the algorithmic simplicity of LBM, IGA-LBM offers a practical route to high-fidelity simulations in engineering and scientific applications.

As quantum processors begin operating as tightly coupled accelerators inside high-performance computing (HPC) facilities, dependable and reproducible behavior becomes a gating requirement for scientific and industrial workloads. We present a hardware-maturity probe that quantifies a device's reliability by testing whether it can repeatedly reproduce the provably global optima of single-layer Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) circuits. Using harmonic analysis, we derive closed-form upper bounds on the number of stationary points in the p=1 QAOA cost landscape for broad classes of combinatorial-optimization problems. These bounds yield an exhaustive yet low-overhead grid-sampling scheme with analytically verifiable outcomes. The probe integrates reliability-engineering notions like run-to-failure statistics, confidence-interval estimation, and reproducibility testing into a single, application-centric benchmark. Our framework supplies a standardized dependability metric for hybrid quantum-HPC (QHPC) workflows.

We introduce a transparent, encoding-agnostic framework for determining when the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) can achieve early quantum advantage. Our analysis shows this is unlikely on noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) hardware even in best case scenarios that use the most qubit-efficient direct encodings. Closed-form resource counts, combined with recent device benchmarks, yield three decisive go/no-go figures of merit: the quantum feasibility point and the qubit- and gate-feasibility lines, which place any CVRP instance on a single decision diagram. Contrasting a direct QUBO mapping with a space-efficient higher-order (HOBO) encoding reveals a large gap. Applied to early-advantage benchmarks such as Golden-5, our diagram shows that HOBO circuits require only 7,685 qubits, whereas comparable QUBO encodings still exceed 200,000 qubits. In addition to identifying candidate instances for early quantum advantage in CVRP, the framework provides a unifying go/no-go metric that ingests any CVRP encoding together with any hardware profile and highlights when quantum devices could challenge classical heuristics. Quantum advantage in CVRP would likely require innovative problem decomposition techniques.

The proliferation of spectroscopic data across various scientific and engineering fields necessitates automated processing. We introduce OASIS (Omni-purpose Analysis of Spectra via Intelligent Systems), a machine learning (ML) framework for technique-independent, automated spectral analysis, encompassing denoising, baseline correction, and comprehensive peak parameter (location, intensity, FWHM) retrieval without human intervention. OASIS achieves its versatility through models trained on a strategically designed synthetic dataset incorporating features from numerous spectroscopy techniques. Critically, the development of innovative, task-specific loss functions-such as the vicinity peak response (ViPeR) for peak localization-enabled the creation of compact yet highly accurate models from this dataset, validated with experimental data from Raman, UV-vis, and fluorescence spectroscopy. OASIS demonstrates significant potential for applications including in situ experiments, high-throughput optimization, and online monitoring. This study underscores the optimization of the loss function as a key resource-efficient strategy to develop high-performance ML models.

We study the Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible (SIS) model on arbitrary networks. The well-established pair approximation treats neighboring pairs of nodes exactly while making a mean field approximation for the rest of the network. We improve the method by expanding the state space dynamically, giving nodes a memory of when they last became susceptible. The resulting approximation is simple to implement and appears to be highly accurate, both in locating the epidemic threshold and in computing the quasi-stationary fraction of infected individuals above the threshold, for both finite graphs and infinite random graphs.

Very-low-field MRIs are becoming increasingly popular due to their portability and adaptability to different environments. They are being successfully used for various clinical applications, leading to a paradigm shift in the way imaging care is typically performed. The development of low-cost MRI scanner prototypes began a few years ago, with some interesting and promising open-source projects emerging in both hardware and software design. Using permanent magnets (PMs) to generate the static magnetic field B0 can substantially reduce the manufacturing cost of low-field scanners while achieving satisfactory homogeneity. This article focuses on characterizing magnet performance in terms of B0 spatial homogeneity. Specifically, it investigates its sensitivity to various factors and explores the reasons for discrepancies between numerical expectations and actual measurements on fabricated magnets. The analysis also examines the consequences of using different numerical model approximations, revisiting concepts most frequently used in other design contexts. While these assumptions simplify the numerical model and may improve its performance in terms of computational time, this paper demonstrates that they also impact the reliability of the obtained results.

Epidemic control frequently relies on adjusting interventions based on prevalence. But designing such policies is a highly non-trivial problem due to uncertain intervention effects, costs and the difficulty of quantifying key transmission mechanisms and parameters. Here, using exact mathematical and computational methods, we reveal a fundamental limit in epidemic control in that prevalence feedback policies are outperformed by a single optimally chosen constant control level. Specifically, we find no incentive to use prevalence based control under a wide class of cost functions that depend arbitrarily on interventions and scale with infections. We also identify regimes where prevalence feedback is beneficial. Our results challenge the current understanding that prevalence based interventions are required for epidemic control and suggest that, for many classes of epidemics, interventions should not be varied unless the epidemic is near the herd immunity threshold.

Ferroelectric nematic fluids are promising materials for tunable nonlinear photonics, with applications ranging from second harmonic generation to sources of entangled photons. However, the few reported values of second-order susceptibilities vary widely depending on the molecular architecture. Here, we systematically measure second-order NLO susceptibilities of five different materials that exhibit the ferroelectric nematic phase, as well as the more recently discovered layered smectic A ferroelectric phase. The materials investigated include archetypal molecular architectures as well as mixtures showing room-temperature ferroelectric phases. The measured values, which range from 0.3 to 20 pm/V, are here reasonably predicted by combining calculations of molecular-level hyperpolarizabilities and a simple nematic potential, highlighting the opportunities of modelling-assisted design for enhanced NLO ferroelectric fluids.

We propose an O(100)m Atom Interferometer (AI) experiment to be installed against a wall of the PX46 access shaft to the LHC. This experiment would probe unexplored ranges of the possible couplings of bosonic ultralight dark matter (ULDM) to atomic constituents and undertake a pioneering search for gravitational waves (GWs) at frequencies intermediate between those to which existing and planned experiments are sensitive, among other fundamental physics studies. A conceptual feasibility study showed that this AI experiment could be isolated from the LHC by installing a shielding wall in the TX46 gallery, and surveyed issues related to the proximity of the LHC machine, finding no technical obstacles. A detailed technical implementation study has shown that the preparatory civil-engineering work, installation of bespoke radiation shielding, deployment of access-control systems and safety alarms, and installation of an elevator platform could be carried out during LS3, allowing installation and operation of the detector to proceed during Run 4 without impacting HL-LHC operation. These studies have established that PX46 is a uniquely promising location for an AI experiment. We foresee that, if the CERN management encourages this Letter of Intent, a significant fraction of the Terrestrial Very Long Baseline Atom Interferometer (TVLBAI) Proto-Collaboration may wish to contribute to such an AI experiment.

Understanding the formation and evolution of stellar-mass binary black holes (BBHs) requires a thorough investigation of the key physical processes involved. While one pathway involves the isolated evolution of massive binary stars, affected by uncertain stages like core-collapse supernovae and common envelope evolution, an alternative channel is dynamical formation in dense stellar environments. Newtonian gravity has traditionally provided a robust and computationally efficient framework for modeling large-scale gravitational interactions. However, accurately capturing close encounters and black hole mergers necessitates the use of general relativity. This work focuses on assessing the applicability of post-Newtonian gravity in bridging these regimes, offering a physically insightful and computationally tractable approach to modeling BBH formation in the gravitational-wave era of astronomy.

Characterizing the environmental interactions of quantum systems is a critical bottleneck in the development of robust quantum technologies. Traditional tomographic methods are often data-intensive and struggle with scalability. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for performing Lindblad tomography using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). By embedding the Lindblad master equation directly into the neural network's loss function, our approach simultaneously learns the quantum state's evolution and infers the underlying dissipation parameters from sparse, time-series measurement data. Our results show that PINNs can reconstruct both the system dynamics and the functional form of unknown noise parameters, presenting a sample-efficient and scalable solution for quantum device characterization. Ultimately, our method produces a fully-differentiable digital twin of a noisy quantum system by learning its governing master equation.

Deep operator network for surrogate modeling of poroelasticity with random permeability fields
Sangjoon Park, Yeonjong Shin, Jinhyun Choo
Subjects:
Machine Learning (cs.LG); Geophysics (physics.geo-ph)
Poroelasticity -- coupled fluid flow and elastic deformation in porous media -- often involves spatially variable permeability, especially in subsurface systems. In such cases, simulations with random permeability fields are widely used for probabilistic analysis, uncertainty quantification, and inverse problems. These simulations require repeated forward solves that are often prohibitively expensive, motivating the development of efficient surrogate models. However, efficient surrogate modeling techniques for poroelasticity with random permeability fields remain scarce. In this study, we propose a surrogate modeling framework based on the deep operator network (DeepONet), a neural architecture designed to learn mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces. The proposed surrogate model approximates the solution operator that maps random permeability fields to transient poroelastic responses. To enhance predictive accuracy and stability, we integrate three strategies: nondimensionalization of the governing equations, input dimensionality reduction via Karhunen--Loéve expansion, and a two-step training procedure that decouples the optimization of branch and trunk networks. The methodology is evaluated on two benchmark problems in poroelasticity: soil consolidation and ground subsidence induced by groundwater extraction. In both cases, the DeepONet achieves substantial speedup in inference while maintaining high predictive accuracy across a wide range of permeability statistics. These results highlight the potential of the proposed approach as a scalable and efficient surrogate modeling technique for poroelastic systems with random permeability fields.

The complex systems keyword diagram generated by the author in 2010 has been used widely in a variety of educational and outreach purposes, but it definitely needs a major update and reorganization. This short paper reports our recent attempt to update the keyword diagram using information collected from the following multiple sources: (a) collective feedback posted on social media, (b) recent reference books on complex systems and network science, (c) online resources on complex systems, and (d) keyword search hits obtained using OpenAlex, an open-access bibliographic catalogue of scientific publications. The data (a), (b) and (c) were used to incorporate the research community's internal perceptions of the relevant topics, whereas the data (d) was used to obtain more objective measurements of the keywords' relevance and associations from publications made in complex systems science. Results revealed differences and overlaps between public perception and actual usage of keywords in publications on complex systems. Four topical communities were obtained from the keyword association network, although they were highly intertwined with each other. We hope that the resulting network visualization of complex systems keywords provides a more up-to-date, accurate topic map of the field of complex systems as of today.

Understanding and predicting the glassy dynamics of small organic molecules is critical for applications ranging from pharmaceuticals to energy and food preservation. In this work, we present a theoretical framework that combines molecular dynamics simulations and Elastically Collective Nonlinear Langevin Equation (ECNLE) theory to predict the structural relaxation behavior of small organic glass-formers. By using propanol, glucose, fructose, and trehalose as model systems, we estimate the glass transition temperature (Tg) from stepwise cooling simulations and volume-temperature analysis. These computed Tg values are then inserted into the ECNLE theory to calculate temperature-dependent relaxation times and diffusion coefficients. Numerical results agree well with experimental data in prior works. This approach provides a predictive and experimentally-independent route for characterizing glassy dynamics in molecular materials.

Title:
Neural networks for learning macroscopic chemotactic sensitivity from microscopic models
Radek Erban
Subjects:
Quantitative Methods (q-bio.QM); Biological Physics (physics.bio-ph)
The macroscopic (population-level) dynamics of chemotactic cell movement -- arising from underlying microscopic (individual-based) models -- are often described by parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) governing the spatio-temporal evolution of cell concentrations. In certain cases, these macroscopic PDEs can be analytically derived from microscopic models, thereby elucidating the dependence of PDE coefficients on the parameters of the underlying individual-based dynamics. However, such analytical derivations are not always feasible, particularly for more complex or nonlinear microscopic models. In these instances, neural networks offer a promising alternative for estimating the coefficients of macroscopic PDEs directly from data generated by microscopic simulations. In this work, three microscopic models of chemotaxis are investigated. The macroscopic chemotaxis sensitivity is estimated using neural networks, thereby bridging the gap between individual-level behaviours and population-level descriptions. The results are compared with macroscopic PDEs, which can be derived for each model in certain parameter regimes.

We use a cavity optomechanical accelerometer to perform a resonant search for ultralight dark matter at acoustic frequencies near 39 kHz (a particle mass of $0.16$ neV/$c^2$). The accelerometer is based on a Si$_3$N$_4$ membrane, cryogenically cooled to 4 K, with photothermal heating employed to scan the resonance frequency by $10^2$ detector linewidths. Leveraging shot-noise-limited displacement readout and radiation pressure feedback cooling, we realize an acceleration resolution of $\sim 10\;\text{n}g_0/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ over a bandwidth of $30$ Hz near the fundamental test mass resonance. We find no evidence of a dark matter signal and infer an upper bound on the coupling to normal matter that is several orders of magnitude above the stringent bounds set by equivalence principle experiments. We outline a path toward novel dark matter constraints in future experiments by exploiting arrays of mass-loaded optomechanical sensors at lower temperature probed with distributed squeezed light.

The Hopfield model describes a neural network that stores memories using all-to-all-coupled spins. Memory patterns are recalled under equilibrium dynamics. Storing too many patterns breaks the associative recall process because frustration causes an exponential number of spurious patterns to arise as the network becomes a spin glass. Despite this, memory recall in a spin glass can be restored, and even enhanced, under quantum-optical nonequilibrium dynamics because spurious patterns can now serve as reliable memories. We experimentally observe associative memory with high storage capacity in a driven-dissipative spin glass made of atoms and photons. The capacity surpasses the Hopfield limit by up to seven-fold in a sixteen-spin network. Atomic motion boosts capacity by dynamically modifying connectivity akin to short-term synaptic plasticity in neural networks, realizing a precursor to learning in a quantum-optical system.

Terrestrial animals often must self-right from an upside-down orientation on the ground to survive. Here, we compared self-righting strategies of the Madagascar hissing, American, and discoid cockroaches on a challenging flat, rigid, low-friction surface to quantify the mechanical principles. All three species almost always self-righted (97% probability) when given time (30 seconds), frequently self-righted (63%) on the first attempt, and on that attempt did so in one second or less. When successful, two of the three species gained and used pitch and/or roll rotational kinetic energy to overcome potential energy barriers (American 63% of all attempts and discoid 78%). By contrast, the largest, heaviest, wingless cockroach (Madagascar hissing) relied far less on the energy of motion and was the slowest to self-right. Two of the three species used rolling strategies to overcome low potential energy barriers. Successful righting attempts had greater rolling rotation than failed attempts as the center of mass rose to the highest position. Madagascar hissing cockroaches rolled using body deformation (98% of all trials) and the American cockroach relied on leg forces (93%). By contrast, the discoid cockroach overcame higher and a wider range of potential energy barriers with simultaneous pitching and rolling using wings (46% of all trials) and legs (49%) equally to self-right. Our quantification revealed the performance advantages of using rotational kinetic energy to overcome the potential energy barrier and rolling more to lower it, while maintaining diverse strategies for ground-based self-righting.

Many snakes live in deserts, forests, and river valleys and traverse challenging 3-D terrain like rocks, felled trees, and rubble, with obstacles as large as themselves and variable surface properties. By contrast, apart from branch cantilevering, burrowing, swimming, and gliding, laboratory studies of snake locomotion focused on that on simple flat surfaces. Here, to begin to understand snake locomotion in complex 3-D terrain, we study how the variable kingsnake, a terrestrial generalist, traversed a large step of variable surface friction and step height (up to 30% snout-vent length). The snake traversed by partitioning its body into three sections with distinct functions. Body sections below and above the step oscillated laterally on horizontal surfaces for propulsion, while the body section in between cantilevered in a vertical plane to bridge the large height increase. As the animal progressed, these three sections traveled down its body, conforming overall body shape to the step. In addition, the snake adjusted the partitioned gait in response to increase in step height and decrease in surface friction, at the cost of reduced speed. As surface friction decreased, body movement below and above the step changed from a continuous lateral undulation with little slip to an intermittent oscillatory movement with much slip, and initial head lift-off became closer to the step. Given these adjustments, body partitioning allowed the snake to be always stable, even when initially cantilevering but before reaching the surface above. Such a partitioned gait may be generally useful for diverse, complex 3-D terrain.

Terradynamically streamlined shapes in animals and robots enhances traversability through densely cluttered terrain

Many animals, modern aircraft, and underwater vehicles use streamlined body shapes that reduce fluid dynamic drag to achieve fast and effective locomotion in air and water. Similarly, numerous small terrestrial animals move through cluttered terrain where 3-D, multi-component obstacles like grass, shrubs, vines, and leaf litter resist motion, but it is unknown whether their body shape plays a major role in traversal. Few ground vehicles or terrestrial robots have used body shape to effectively traverse cluttered terrain. Here, we challenged forest-floor-dwelling discoid cockroaches possessing a thin, rounded body to traverse tall, narrowly spaced, vertical, grass-like compliant beams. Animals displayed high traversal performance (79 +/- 12% probability and 3.4 +/- 0.7 s time). Although we observed diverse traversal strategies, cockroaches primarily (48 +/- 9 % probability) used a novel roll maneuver, allowing them to rapidly traverse obstacle gaps narrower than half body width (2.0 +/- 0.5 s traversal time). Reduction of body roundness by addition of artificial shells nearly inhibited roll maneuvers and decreased traversal performance. Inspired by this discovery, we added a thin, rounded exoskeletal shell to a legged robot with a nearly cuboidal body, common to many existing terrestrial robots. Without adding sensory feedback or changing the open-loop control, the rounded shell enabled the robot to traverse beam obstacles with gaps narrower than shell width via body roll. Terradynamically streamlined shapes can reduce terrain resistance and enhance traversability by assisting effective body reorientation via distributed mechanical feedback. Our findings highlight the need to consider body shape to improve robot mobility in real-world terrain often filled with clutter, and to develop better locomotor-ground contact models to understand interaction with complex terrain.

General Physics (physics.gen-ph)
Massive stellar gravitational collapse is not an endless process. The Standard Model of particle physics predicts the existence of a repulsive interaction, two-neutrino mediated, with a coherent weak charge of macroscopic matter proportional to the number of constituents. After gravity, this is the second longest range -- microns -- force and, below nanometers, its magnitude overcomes the attractive gravitation. The layer distribution of pressure inside a compact neutronized uniform sphere, independent of its size, is compared for the two interactions with opposite pressure gradient. Taking as reference the mean square radius, the volume evolution of the pressure, for fixed mass and weak charge, leads to an equilibrium scenario with a characteristic black-hole radius $R_B = 1.58$ nm. This size scale should be universal, independent of the mass, as long as the mass is nearly proportional to the weak charge.

Being three-dimensional, stellarators have the advantage that plasma currents are not essential for creating rotational-transform; however, the external current-carrying coils in stellarators can have strong geometrical shaping, which can complicate the construction.
Reducing the inter-coil electromagnetic forces acting on strongly shaped 3D coils and the stress on the support structure while preserving the favorable properties of the magnetic field is a design challenge.
In this work, we recognize that the inter-coil forces are the gradient of the vacuum magnetic energy.
We introduce an objective functional built on the usual quadratic flux on a prescribed target surface together with a weighed penalty on the vacuum energy.
The Euler-Lagrange equation for stationary states is derived, and numerical illustrations are computed using a modern stellarator optimization framework. A study of the effect of the energy functional on the inter-coil forces is conducted and the energy is shown to be a promising quantity in producing coils with low forces.

Sea ice floe segmentation in close-range optical imagery using active contour and foundation models

Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics (physics.ao-ph)
The size of sea ice floes in the marginal ice zone (MIZ) is a key factor influencing ice coverage, albedo, wave propagation through ice-covered waters, and ocean--atmosphere energy exchanges. Floe size can be observed by processing visual-range imagery from ships, aircraft, or satellites. However, autonomously capturing floe boundaries from imagery remains challenging, particularly due to the heterogeneity of sea ice, which impairs boundary definition and reduces image clarity. This study evaluates the accuracy of sea ice floe segmentation using the gradient vector flow (GVF) active contour method, the deep learning-based Segment Anything Model (SAM), and a hybrid approach combining GVF and SAM. These methods are evaluated on a representative subset of a large dataset of close-range, high-resolution sea ice imagery, collected from cameras aboard an icebreaker during an Antarctic winter expedition. Spanning a wide range of ice conditions and image clarity in the MIZ, the subset provides a rigorous test bed of segmentation approaches. Their performance is assessed in terms of floe detection accuracy, floe size distribution, and ice concentration, with results compared against a manually segmented benchmark. The findings indicate that SAM, when used in prompt-driven mode, offers the best balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. Its strong performance in estimating sea ice concentration and detecting floes, while maintaining close agreement with benchmark floe size distributions, makes it suitable for real-time applications and scalable analysis of large imagery datasets.

Large Differences Between Stochastic and Deterministic Kinetics in a Simple Autocatalytic Reaction Network

Comments:

Subjects:
Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph)
In small systems, quantitative discrepancies between stochastic and deterministic descriptions of chemical kinetics can be significant, with their magnitude depending on the specific reaction network. Here, we study the Finke-Watzky model-an irreversible autocatalysis, A + B -- > 2B, supplemented by an irreversible first-order process, A -- > B. This model has been used to describe the formation of transition metal nanoparticles and protein misfolding and aggregation, but it may also serve as a minimal model for the spread of a non-fatal but incurable disease. We show that, for certain parameter values, exceptionally large deviations can arise between stochastic and deterministic kinetics of the Finke-Watzky model. Moreover, its stochastic time evolution may be highly sensitive to initial conditions. These properties are retained in the generalization of the model to reversible reactions. To quantify the differences between the predictions of deterministic and stochastic kinetics, we derive the explicit analytical solution of the Chemical Master Equation for the Finke-Watzky model. This solution also allows us to derive analogous solutions for two related reaction networks: A + A -- > A + B, A -- > B, and A + A -- > A + B, A + B -- > 2B. Our findings may have implications for modeling epidemics and intracellular chemical processes, and more broadly for models of population dynamics.

We present a method for incorporating a stochastic point of view into physics exercises of mathematics education. The core of our method is the randomization of some inputs, the system model used does not differ from what we would use in the deterministic approach. We consider exercises from the theory of projectile motion and statics. The outputs of stochastic models are random variables, and we usually determine their probability distributions, expected values, variances, and relative standard deviations, and the probabilities of some events related to them are also calculated. Students and teachers familiar with elementary probability theory and mechanics may find these exercises useful for understanding some basic concepts of stochastic mechanics.

Portable, low-field Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanners are increasingly being deployed in clinical settings. However, key barriers to their widespread use include low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), generally low image quality, and long scan durations. Hence, methods for accelerating acquisition and boosting image quality are critically important to enable clinically actionable, high-quality imaging in these systems. Despite the role that compressed sensing (CS) and deep learning (DL)-based methods have played in improving image quality for high-field MRI, their adoption for low-field imaging is still in its infancy, and it remains unclear how robust these methods are in low-SNR regimes.
Here, we propose, investigate, and compare four reconstruction approaches: (i) L1-wavelet CS; (ii) a data-driven network; (iii) an unrolled network; and (iv) a Swin Transformer Cascade. We evaluate their performance across a range of SNR values using publicly available datasets and ultra-low field (6.5 mT) MRI data. Our results show that the unrolled network and Swin Transformer cascade outperform CS and data-driven models. While transformer-based models achieve the highest performance at high SNR, unrolled convolution-based networks are more robust in ultra-low SNR settings and often outperform transformers, indicating that simpler DL architectures may be better suited to low-field MRI.
This work highlights both the potential and limitations of advanced reconstruction techniques in low-field MRI and pinpoints effective DL strategies for addressing SNR challenges.

Subjects:
General Physics (physics.gen-ph)
In this work, we prove the equivalence between the zero distributions of the Riemann zeta function {\zeta}(s) and a two-dimensional (2D) Ising model with a mixture of ferromagnetic and randomly distributed competing interactions. At first, we review briefly the characteristics of the Riemann hypothesis and its connections to physics, in particular, to statistical physics. Second, we build a 2D Ising model, M_(FI+SGI)^2D, in which interactions between the nearest neighboring spins are ferromagnetic along one crystallographic direction while competing ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic interactions are randomly distributed along another direction. Third, we prove that all energy eigenvalues of this 2D Ising model M_(FI+SGI)^2D are real and randomly distributed as the Möbius function {\mu}(n), the Dirichlet L(s,\c{hi}_k ) function as well as the Riemann zeta function {\zeta}(s). Fourth, we prove that the eigenvectors of the 2D Ising model M_(FI+SGI)^2D are constructed by the eigenvectors of the 1D Ising model with phases related to the Riemann zeta function {\zeta}(s), via the relation {\omega}({\gamma}_2j) between the angle {\omega} and the energy eigenvalues {\gamma}_2j, which form the Hilbert-Pólya space. Fifth, we prove that all the zeros of the partition function of the 2D Ising model M_(FI+SGI)^2D lie on an unit circle in a complex temperature plane (i.e. Fisher zeros), which can be mapped to the zero distribution of the Dirichlet L(s,\c{hi}_k ) function and also the Riemann zeta function {\zeta}(s) in the critical line. In a conclusion, we have proven the closure of the nontrivial zero distribution of the L(s,\c{hi}_k ) function (including the Riemann zeta function {\zeta}(s)).

Power Laws for the Thermal Slip Length of a Liquid/Solid Interface From the Structure and Frequency Response of the Contact Zone

Today's powerful integrated chips for information processing, computer graphics and visualization generate so much heat that liquid based cooling is now indispensable to prevent breakdown from thermal runaway effects. While thermal convection schemes using two-phase cooling in microfluidic networks or liquid immersion are proving effective, further progress requires tackling the intrinsic thermal resistance of a liquid/solid (L/S) interface, quantified by the thermal slip length. Theoretical models and experimental tools for estimating this length have been developed for superfluid/metal interfaces but no comparable tools exist for systems at non-cryogenic temperatures. Researchers have therefore come to rely heavily on non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations to understand the influence of various parameters. But despite considerable effort, no actual relations have been proposed. Our study of 180 systems describing a liquid layer confined between identical crystals at different temperatures highlights the influence of correlated behavior throughout the L/S contact zone. When rescaled by key variables in the zone, the data for the thermal slip length exhibit excellent collapse onto two power law relations dependent on the peak value of the in-plane structure factor of the first liquid layer and the ratio of dominant frequencies pegged to the maxima in the vibrational density of states of the first liquid and solid layer. We hope that this perspective, which highlights the critical role of surface localized phonons in L/S systems, can now better guide development of analytic models and de novo interface designs for minimizing thermal slip.

We use Bayesian optimization in combination with three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations to determine the optimal laser and plasma parameters that, for a given laser pulse energy, maximize the cut-off energy of an electron beam produced by laser wakefield accelerators. We assume a Gaussian laser driver with matched spot size and amplitude and investigate both self-guiding in a uniform-density plasma and guiding in a preformed plasma channel with matched radius. To interpret the simulation results quantitatively, we derive novel analytical expressions for the maximum electron energy and the corresponding acceleration distance, accounting for the effects of laser diffraction and energy depletion. Based on the results obtained, we discuss the potential scalability of the optimal input (plasma density, pulse duration, amplitude, spot size, and channel radius) and output (electron energy, electron charge, acceleration length, and acceleration efficiency) parameters to laser systems of arbitrary energy.

Growth Regime Shifts in Empirical Networks: Evidence and Challenges from the Software Heritage and APS Citation Case Studies
Guillaume Rousseau

Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability (physics.data-an); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph); Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph)
We investigate the evolution rules and degree distribution properties of the Software Heritage dataset, a large-scale growing network linking software releases and revisions from open-source communities. The network spans over 40 years and includes about 6 billion nodes and edges. Our analysis relies on natural temporal and topological partitions of nodes and edges.
A derived temporalized graph reveals a bow-tie-like structure and enables study of edge dynamics -- creation, inheritance, and aging -- together with comparisons to minimal models. In- and out-degree distributions and edge timestamp histograms expose regime shifts linked to changes in developer practices, notably in the average number of edges per new node.
Without presupposing its validity, we estimate the scaling exponent under the scale-free hypothesis. Results highlight the sensitivity of a widely used estimation method to regime changes and outliers, while showing that partitioning improves regularity and helps disentangle these effects.
We extend the analysis to the APS citation network, which also exhibits a major regime shift around 1985, though driven by distinct factors. Both cases illustrate how structural and dynamical transitions complicate conclusions about the existence and observability of a scale-free regime. These findings underscore the need for refined tools to study transient growth phases and to enable robust comparisons between empirical growing networks and minimal models.

The UK has a long-established reputation for excellence in research across a broad range of fields, but in recent years, there has been greater emphasis on STEM investment and greater recognition of the UK's success in STEM. This paper examines the relative strengths of SHAPE disciplines and demonstrates that the UK's SHAPE research portfolio outperforms the UK's STEM research, for each international benchmark considered in this work. It is argued that SHAPE research is becoming increasingly important as a partner to STEM as the widespread use of technology creates societal challenges. It is also argued that the strength of UK SHAPE is the basis of a strategic advantage for UK research.

Purpose: To develop and validate a framework for rapid, accurate, and reproducible whole-brain, multi-pool chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) imaging at 3T, addressing challenges of long acquisition times and confounding factors. Methods: A single-shot 3D true fast imaging with steady-state precession (True FISP) sequence was optimized for whole-brain multi-pool CEST. Rapid B0, B1, and T1 mapping was performed using a dual-echo modified four-angle method. A feed-forward neural network was developed for rapid B1 correction, trained against the conventional multi-power method. The apparent exchange-dependent relaxation (AREX) metric was used to correct for T1 and magnetization transfer (MT) effects. The framework was validated in phantoms and healthy human subjects (N=8), including a test-retest reproducibility assessment. Results: The True FISP sequence yielded high-quality, whole-brain images with minimal artifacts and distortion in a clinically feasible scan time (~9 minutes). Phantom studies confirmed the effectiveness of B1 correction (coefficient of variation [CV] for MT_MTRLD decreased from 22.49% to 4.61%) and AREX-based confounder correction (CV for APT_AREX reduced from 33.6% to 6.9%). The neural network B1 correction showed excellent agreement with the conventional multi-power method in vivo (ICC > 0.97). High test-retest reproducibility was demonstrated across 96 brain regions, with the average CV for APT_AREX under 10% for over 95% of regions. Conclusion: A rapid and robust framework for whole-brain quantitative multi-pool CEST imaging was successfully developed and validated. By integrating an efficient acquisition sequence with a streamlined correction pipeline, this approach overcomes key barriers to clinical translation, enabling reliable metabolic imaging for widespread brain pathologies.

In this paper, a solution to Zeno's paradox of motion was offered and a possible, based on observations and empirical viewpoint, interpretation. A gedanken experiment was proposed in accordance to our empirical and experimental paradigm, offering solutions from pendular energy and geometric gravity theory, the standard view, and classical physics, as a reply to Zeno's paradox (of motion), departing from the logical and overly mathematical frameworks, which either offered a solution detached from experiment and observations, the former, and a solution with neither explanation nor interpretation, the latter. It takes on the problem of unmeasurable regions, Zeno's paradoxes (measure and motion), and infinitesimals, offering some insights that could be found interesting for both, metaphysical and foundations of physics fields.

The use of a wire probe is a robust method for beam profile measurement, but it can only provide a 1D projection of the beam profile. In this study, we developed a novel method for measuring a beam projected from a 360° angle by a dual-axis rotation of a wire probe and obtaining a complete 2D profile via image reconstruction. We conducted a proof-of-principle study using an Ar+ ion beam and optimized the reconstruction algorithm. The experimental results showed that the use of the order subsets expectation maximization (OS-EM) algorithm is the most reasonable method, providing a highly accurate absolute 2D beam profile within a processing time on the millisecond scale. Furthermore, analysis of 2D profiles at different probing positions provided the beam direction and the phase space distribution. This versatile method can be applied to various fields of quantum beam technologies, such as particle therapy, semiconductor processing, and material analysis, as well as basic scientific research.

The research identifies key trends in regional job distribution, degree and skill requirements, and the evolving demand for QT-related roles. Findings reveal a strong presence of the QT job market in the United States and Europe, with increasing corporate demand for engineers, software developers, and PhD-level researchers. Despite growing industry applications, the sector remains in its early stages, dominated by large technology firms and requiring significant investment in education and workforce development. The study highlights the need for targeted educational programs, interdisciplinary collaboration, and industry-academic partnerships to bridge the QT workforce gap.

Small-scale gravity waves, with horizontal wavelengths of up to a few hundred kilometers and vertical wavelengths of up to a few kilometers, play a crucial role in atmospheric tracer transport. However, their effects remain unresolved in climate models and must be parameterized. This study investigates how gravity waves influence large-scale tracer distributions, utilizing a multiple-scale analysis to systematically identify the governing terms of gravity wave-induced tracer fluxes. The analysis reveals both leading-order and next-order impacts: the former being the inertia-gravity wave-induced tracer Stokes drift, which acts perpendicular to both the large-scale tracer gradient and the wave number, while the latter becomes significant at lower latitudes where Coriolis effects diminish. A numerical framework is developed to incorporate these fluxes into a gravity wave parameterization model, potentially enhancing climate model accuracy without requiring explicit resolution of small-scale wave dynamics. Model validation against high-resolution wave-resolving simulations confirms the effectiveness of this approach. By improving the representation of gravity wave-induced tracer transport, this research advances the accuracy of climate simulations, particularly in their depiction of microphysics and radiative processes.

Dimensionless learning based on information

Dimensional analysis is one of the most fundamental tools for understanding physical systems. However, the construction of dimensionless variables, as guided by the Buckingham-$\pi$ theorem, is not uniquely determined. Here, we introduce IT-$\pi$, a model-free method that combines dimensionless learning with the principles of information theory. Grounded in the irreducible error theorem, IT-$\pi$ identifies dimensionless variables with the highest predictive power by measuring their shared information content. The approach is able to rank variables by predictability, identify distinct physical regimes, uncover self-similar variables, determine the characteristic scales of the problem, and extract its dimensionless parameters. IT-$\pi$ also provides a bound of the minimum predictive error achievable across all possible models, from simple linear regression to advanced deep learning techniques, naturally enabling a definition of model efficiency. We benchmark IT-$\pi$ across different cases and demonstrate that it offers superior performance and capabilities compared to existing tools. The method is also applied to conduct dimensionless learning for supersonic turbulence, aerodynamic drag on both smooth and irregular surfaces, magnetohydrodynamic power generation, and laser-metal interaction.

The chaotic dynamics of small-scale vorticity plays a key role in understanding and controlling turbulence, with direct implications for energy transfer, mixing, and coherent structure evolution. However, measuring or controlling its dynamics remains a major conceptual and experimental challenge due to its transient and chaotic nature. Here we use a combination of experiments, theory and simulations to show that small magnetic particles of different densities, exploring flow regions of distinct vorticity statistics, can act as effective probes for measuring and forcing turbulence at its smallest scale. The interplay between the magnetic torque, from an externally controllable magnetic field, and hydrodynamic stresses, from small-scale turbulent vorticity, reveals an extremely rich phenomenology. Notably, we present the first observation of stochastic resonance for particles in turbulence: turbulent fluctuations, effectively acting as noise, counterintuitively enhance the particle rotational response to external forcing. We identify a pronounced resonant peak in particle rotational phase-lag when the applied magnetic field matches the characteristic intensity of small-scale vortices. Furthermore, we uncover a novel symmetry-breaking mechanism: an oscillating magnetic field with zero-mean angular velocity remarkably induces net particle rotation in turbulence with zero-mean vorticity, as turbulent fluctuations aid the particle in "surfing" the magnetic field. Our findings offer insights into flexible particle manipulation in complex flows and open up a novel magnetic resonance-based approach for measuring vorticity: magnetic particles as probes emit detectable magnetic fields, enabling turbulence quantification even under optically-inaccessible conditions.

We describe a resonant cavity search apparatus for axion dark matter constructed by the Quantum Sensors for the Hidden Sector (QSHS) collaboration. The apparatus is configured to search for QCD axion dark matter, though also has the capability to detect axion-like particles (ALPs), dark photons, and some other forms of wave-like dark matter. Initially, a tuneable cylindrical oxygen-free copper cavity is read out using a low noise microwave amplifier feeding a heterodyne receiver. The cavity is housed in a dilution refrigerator and threaded by a solenoidal magnetic field, nominally 8T. The apparatus also houses a magnetic field shield for housing superconducting electronics, and several other fixed-frequency resonators for use in testing and commissioning various prototype quantum electronic devices sensitive at a range of axion masses in the range 2.0 to 40 micro-eV/c2. The apparatus as currently configured is intended as a test stand for electronics over the relatively wide frequency band attainable with the TM010 cavity mode used for axion searches. We present performance data for the resonator, dilution refrigerator, and magnet, and plans for the first science run.

In this study, we investigate the effect of incorporating explicit dispersion interactions in the functional form of machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), particularly in the Moment Tensor Potential and Equivariant Tensor Network potential for accurate modeling of liquid carbon tetrachloride, methane, and toluene. We show that explicit incorporation of dispersion interactions via D2 and D3 corrections significantly improves the accuracy of MLIPs when the cutoff radius is set to a commonly used value of 5 -- 6 Å. We also show that for carbon tetrachloride and methane, a substantial improvement in accuracy can be achieved by extending the cutoff radius to 7.5 Å. However, for accurate modeling of toluene, explicit incorporation of dispersion remains important. Furthermore, we find that MLIPs incorporating dispersion interactions via D2 reach a close level of accuracy to those incorporating D3, and D2 is suitable for accurate modeling of the systems in the study, while being less computationally expensive. We evaluated the accuracy of MLIPs in dimer binding curves compared to ab initio data and in predicting density and radial distribution functions compared to experiments.

Reverse energy flows: the physical mechanism underling dramatic reduction of loss in hollow-core fibers
Andrey Pryamikov, Sergei Turitsyn
Subjects:
Optics (physics.optics)
Hollow-core fibers (HCFs) with claddings composed of silica glass capillaries have recently attracted a great deal of attention following the demonstration of optical loss levels lower than those of conventional telecommunication fibers. It is well established already that optical losses in HCFs are highly sensitive to both the wavelength and the geometry of the cladding capillaries. The underlying physical mechanisms behind reducing loss with the change of HCF design parameters while keeping the same fiber structure are not yet fully understood. In this work, we investigate the relationship between light localization and corresponding decrease of losses in HCFs and the distribution of reverse energy fluxes in air-core modes. We show here that the shape of the capillaries plays a crucial role in controlling radial energy backflows that influence light confinement and the energy leakage from air-core modes of HCFs. Through numerical modeling, we demonstrate that optimizing the capillary geometry to tailor the distribution of reverse radial energy fluxes leads to a substantial reduction in transmission losses even in fibers with relatively simple cladding structures. Consideration of the energy flows and observed occurrences of vortex of the Poynting vector allows us to a draw an interesting interdisciplinary analogy with the hydrodynamical system with suppressed backward flow - Tesla valve. We believe that combination of singular optics and energy fluxes analysis provides valuable physical insight into the mechanisms governing waveguiding in HCFs offering a pathway toward novel designs with minimized leakage loss.

Machine learning potential-driven molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have significantly enhanced the predictive accuracy of thermal transport properties across diverse materials. However, extracting phonon-mode-resolved insights from these simulations remains a critical challenge. Here, we introduce PYSED, a Python-based package built on the spectral energy density (SED) method, designed to efficiently compute kinetic-energy-weighted phonon dispersion and extract phonon lifetime from large-scale MD simulation trajectories. By integrating high-accuracy machine-learned neuroevolution potential (NEP) models, we validate and showcase the effectiveness of the implemented SED method across systems of varying dimensionalities. Specifically, the NEP-driven MD-SED accurately reveals how phonon modes are affected by strain in carbon nanotubes, as well as by interlayer coupling strengths and the twist angles in two-dimensional molybdenum disulfide. For three-dimensional systems, the SED method effectively establishes the thermal transport regime diagram for metal-organic frameworks, distinguishing between particlelike and wavelike propagation regions. Moreover, using bulk silicon as an example, we show that phonon SED can efficiently capture quantum dynamics based on path-integral trajectories. The PYSED package bridges MD simulations with detailed phonon-mode insights, delivering a robust tool for investigating thermal transport properties with detailed mechanisms across various materials.

Cosmic-ray transport in turbulent astrophysical environments remains a multifaceted problem, and despite decades of study the impact of complex magnetic field geometry -- evident in simulations and observations -- has only recently received more focused attention. To understand how ensemble-averaged transport behaviour emerges from the intricate interactions between cosmic rays and structured magnetic turbulence, we run test-particle experiments in snapshots of a strongly turbulent magnetohydrodynamics simulation. We characterize particle-turbulence interactions via the gyro radii of particles and their experienced field-line curvatures, which reveals two distinct transport modes: magnetized motion, where particles are tightly bound to strong coherent flux tubes and undergo large-scale mirroring; and unmagnetized motion characterized by chaotic scattering through weak and highly tangled regions of the magnetic field. We formulate an effective stochastic process for each mode: compound subdiffusion with long mean free paths for magnetized motion, and a Langevin process with short mean free paths for unmagnetized motion. A combined stochastic walker that alternates between these two modes accurately reproduces the mean squared displacements observed in the test-particle data. Our results emphasize the critical role of coherent magnetic structures in comprehensively understanding cosmic-ray transport and lay a foundation for developing a theory of geometry-mediated transport.

In this work, the effect of the measurement position on measurements of $H_\text{p}(3)$ of a new active eye lens dosemeter prototype based on the Dosepix detector is examined. A comparison between measuring directly in front of the eye and measuring at the side of the head of an Alderson phantom showed no significant influence on the resulting $H_\text{p}(3)$ for different radiation qualities and angles. In addition, to account for the absorption effect of radiation safety glasses, pieces of lead glass were attached to the front and side of the dosemeter. Corresponding effects and consequences for radiation protection measurements have been investigated by using a human like Alderson head phantom as well as thermoluminescent dosemeters (TLDs) and the active eye lens dosemeter prototype. For specific angles, the radiation bypassed the radiation safety glasses and lead glass pieces, leading to an increase in the measured $H_\text{p}(3)$. Compared to TLDs behind radiation safety glasses, measurements with the lead glass shielded prototype resulted in lower values for $H_\text{p}(3)$. Furthermore, the results did not reproduce previous findings where larger dose values were found for Dosepix behind lead glass pieces than for the TLDs behind radiation safety glasses. A possible reason might be that the dimensions of the lead glass pieces are not representative of the radiation safety glasses in front of the eye but, ultimately, it is not yet clear what the main reason for the deviation is. Therefore, it is advisable to test the same methodology in future investigations with other eyewear models and lead glass pieces to investigate whether similar behaviors occur.

Compact and programmable large-scale optical processor in free space

Subjects:
Optics (physics.optics)
Photonic circuits are central to classical and quantum information processing. While integrated technologies dominate, free-space architectures are emerging as attractive alternatives, offering broad bandwidth and direct manipulation of optical modes without confinement in waveguides. A key challenge for scalability lies in circuit depth, as the number of layers manipulating the optical field typically grows with the system size. Here, we introduce a programmable free-space photonic platform that performs high-dimensional unitary transformations using only three layers. Information is encoded in structured light modes defined by circular polarization and quantized transverse momenta, and processed with spatial light modulators interleaved with half-wave plates. We implement unitaries that are equivalent to quantum walks over up to 30 time steps, in one- and two-dimensional lattices, distributing a single input mode across more than 7,000 outputs, where conventional approaches would require tens or hundreds of layers. Despite being restricted to translationally-invariant systems, the platform supports diverse quantum walk dynamics, including disorder, synthetic gauge fields, and topological effects, previously explored only in separate experiments. Using coincidence detection with a time-tagging camera, we show compatibility with quantum optics protocols and provide examples of quantum walks of heralded single photons. These results contribute to establish free-space optical processors as promising resources for high-dimensional quantum simulation and scalable optical information processing.

Realistic ENSO Dynamics Requires a Damped Nonlinear Recharge Oscillator

Comments:

Subjects:
Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics (physics.ao-ph)
The dynamics of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are succinctly captured by the Recharge Oscillator (RO) framework. However, to simulate ENSO realistically, careful choices must be made regarding the RO's key parameters. In particular, nonlinear parameters govern how well the model reproduces ENSO asymmetries-El Niño events tend to be stronger but relatively short, often transitioning into La Niña, whereas La Niña events are typically weaker but may last longer. While amplitude asymmetry has been studied within the RO framework, duration and transition asymmetries remain less explored and their causes are debated. In this study, by systematically exploring the RO parameter space-rather than relying on commonly used fitting methods-we identify optimal parameter values that successfully capture key linear and nonlinear ENSO characteristics. In doing so, we revisit several foundational elements of the RO framework. First, we analytically derive the phase relationship between temperature and heat content anomalies, showing that it depends on the signs of the Bjerknes feedback and the ocean damping timescale. We show that self-sustained oscillations fail to reproduce the observed kurtosis of Niño indices. We further derive an analytical expression for the power spectrum and argue that incorporating red noise forcing, rather than white noise, introduces unnecessary complexity. The most realistic yet simplest RO configuration is a strongly damped oscillator, with a decay timescale shorter than the dominant period, forced by multiplicative white noise and influenced by weak deterministic nonlinearities. Identifying these minimal components preserves the RO framework's clarity and isolates the core physical processes underlying ENSO behavior.

A deep learning model for chemical shieldings in molecular organic solids including anisotropy

Subjects:
Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph)
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) chemical shifts are powerful probes of local atomic and electronic structure that can be used to resolve the structures of powdered or amorphous molecular solids. Chemical shift driven structure elucidation depends critically on accurate and fast predictions of chemical shieldings, and machine learning (ML) models for shielding predictions are increasingly used as scalable and efficient surrogates for demanding ab initio calculations. However, the prediction accuracies of current ML models still lag behind those of the DFT reference methods they approximate, especially for nuclei such as $^{13}$C and $^{15}$N. Here, we introduce ShiftML3.0, a deep-learning model that improves the accuracy of predictions of isotropic chemical shieldings in molecular solids, and does so while also predicting the full shielding tensor. On experimental benchmark sets, we find root-mean-squared errors with respect to experiment for ShiftML3.0 that approach those of DFT reference calculations, with RMSEs of 0.53 ppm for $^{1}$H, 2.4 ppm for $^{13}$C, and 7.2 ppm for $^{15}$N, compared to DFT values of 0.49 ppm, 2.3 ppm, and 5.8 ppm, respectively.

Luminescence imaging is invaluable for studying biological and material systems, particularly when advanced protocols that exploit temporal dynamics are employed. However, implementing such protocols often requires custom instrumentation, either modified commercial systems or fully bespoke setups, which poses a barrier for researchers without expertise in optics, electronics, or software. To address this, we present a versatile macroscopic fluorescence imaging system capable of supporting a wide range of protocols, and provide detailed build instructions along with open-source software to enable replication with minimal prior experience. We demonstrate its broad utility through applications to plants, reversibly photoswitchable fluorescent proteins, and optoelectronic devices.

A validation strategy for aviation radiation hazard mitigation has been completed using two commercial airline flights in 2024 and 2025. We review the strategy primary elements, including the emergence of aviation radiation awareness and collaborative efforts by global aviation and radiological bodies that established mitigation standards. The article highlights biological effects of radiation exposure influenced by altitude, latitude, and geomagnetic conditions, upon aircrew, frequent flyers, and commercial space travelers. It recognizes the SWAG user needs survey report that identifies the need for continuous monitoring and predictive models to ensure long-term occupational and public health safety. The ALARA strategy validation was completed using two UAL 990 flights on B777 200 aircraft between San Francisco and Paris. Each carried the same ARMAS FM7 radiation monitoring unit. One flight occurred during the Gannon storm May 10 and 11, 2024 and one flight occurred during quiet geomagnetic conditions June 8 and 9, 2025. The flight results validated the strategy during extreme space weather, i.e., apply operational controls for shielding to reduce dose. One approach is fly lower magnetic latitudes to gain more Earth magnetic field shielding and the other is fly lower altitudes to use atmosphere depth shielding. Both ALARA shielding methods are controllable in airline operations and air traffic management. This study shows the effectiveness to deviate flight paths to lower magnetic latitude routes and lower altitudes during major geomagnetic storms. Not only does this approach mitigate HF communication outages but it also reduces risks from increased GNSS errors for takeoff and landing navigation. Magnetic field shielding is a major risk reduction factor for radiation, communication, and navigation while altitude shielding reduces radiation hazard risks.

The recently observed plasmonic skyrmions, as electromagnetic counterparts of topologically stable quasiparticles, hold significant promise as novel carriers for robust information transfer and manipulation of nontrivial light-matter interactions. However, their practical applications has been hindered by the lack of flexible tuning devices to encode these topological structures. Here, we present a programmable plasmonic skyrmion platform capable of encoding diverse skyrmion topologies, including Neel-type skyrmions and merons. Based on unprecedented ultra-fast coding feature, we synthesize harmonic skyrmions in the temporal dimension and, for the first time, applied skyrmions in communication and sensing applications. Specifically, we achieved highly robust and multi-channel wireless communications by using programmable topological skyrmions, providing a promising platform for communication in turbulent noise channels and extreme conditions. Furthermore, we implemented intelligent sensing across twenty animal models on the same platform, achieving high recognition accuracy. This methodology offers programmable and temporal insights into the skyrmions for their practical applications in next-generation wireless communication and intelligent sensing.

Wheeler's spacetime foams (wormholes) at the Planck length undergo quantum nucleation, oscillation and annihilation. Their collective excitations over foamy spacetime interact with field operators at large distances. We describe such collective excitation and interaction using an effective ``foamon'' field coupled with field operators. The Wilson renormalisation group approach shows that the foamon field theory evolves from an infrared scaling invariant domain to an ultraviolet one, when numerous particles are present. In these domains, the foamon field induces an effective action of field operators, and its correlation length sets a natural scale. Applying this to cosmology, we obtain the effective Einstein action for the Ricci scalar and the cosmological constant (dark energy), including its equation of state and interaction with matter.

Numerical turbulence simulations typically involve parameterizations such as Large Eddy Simulations (LES). Applications to geophysical flows, especially ocean flows, are further complicated by the presence of complex topography and interior landforms such as coastlines, islands, and capes. In this work, we extend pseudo-spectral quasi-geostrophic (QG) numerical schemes and GPU-based solvers to simulate flows with coastal boundaries using the Brinkman volume penalization approach. We incorporate sponging and a splitting scheme to handle inflow and aperiodic boundary conditions. We evaluate four analytical sub-grid-scale (SGS) closures based on the eddy viscosity hypothesis: the standard Smagorinsky and Leith closures, and their dynamic variants. We show applications to QG flows past circular islands and capes with the beta-plane approximation. We perform both a priori analysis of the SGS closure terms as well as a posteriori assessment of the SGS terms and simulated vorticity fields. Our results showcase differences between the various closures, especially their approach to phase and feature reconstruction errors in the presence of coastal boundaries.

We propose an effective explicit numerical scheme for simulating solutions of stochastic differential equations with confining superlinear drift terms, driven by multiplicative heavy-tailed Lévy noise. The scheme is designed to prevent explosion and accurately capture all finite moments of the solutions.
In the purely Gaussian case, it correctly reproduces moments of sub-Gaussian tails of the solutions.
This method is particularly well-suited for approximating statistical moments and other probabilistic characteristics of Lévy flights in steep potential landscapes.

While models continue to become more generalisable, an open challenge relates to efficient uncertainty predictions for active learning and robust error analysis. In this work, we utilise MACE and its multi-head mechanism to implement a committee neural network potential for message-passing architectures, where the committee comprises multiple output modules attached to the same atomic environment descriptors. As with traditional committees of independent networks, the standard deviation of the predictions functions as an estimate of the model's uncertainty. We show for a range of datasets in custom-build models that the uncertainty of the force predictions correlates well with the true errors. We subsequently apply this concept to foundation models, specifically MACE-MP-0, where we train only the newly attached output heads while keeping the remaining part of the model fixed. We use this approach in an active learning workflow to condense the training set of the foundation model to just 5\% of its original size. The foundation model multi-head committee trained on the condensed training set enables reliable uncertainty estimation without any substantial decrease in prediction accuracy.

Recent experiments have demonstrated that the resolution of superlensing slabs can be significantly enhanced with complex frequency illuminations. In this study, we introduce a novel theoretical framework for analyzing superlensing. The framework offers new and transparent insights. It helps clarify what resolution can be expected with complex frequency, or more generally pulse illuminations, but it also highlights inherent limitations and tempers high expectations raised by the recent electromagnetic experiments.

A major challenge in diagnosing and treating cancer is the infiltrative growth of tumors into surrounding tissues.
This microscopic spread of the disease is invisible on most diagnostic imaging modalities and can often only be detected histologically in biopsies.
The purpose of this paper is to develop a physically based model of tumor spread that captures the histologically observed behavior in terms of seeding small tumor islets in prostate cancer.
The model is based on three elementary events: a tumor cell can move, duplicate, or die.
The propensity of each event is given by an Ising-like Hamiltonian that captures correlations between neighboring cells.
The model parameters were fitted to clinical data obtained from surgical specimens taken from 23 prostate cancer patients.
The results demonstrate that this straightforward physical model effectively describes the distribution of the size and the number of tumor islets in prostate cancer.
The simulated tumor islets exhibit a regular, approximately spherical shape, correctly mimicking the shapes observed in histology.
This is due to the Ising interaction term between neighboring cells acting as a surface tension that gives rise to regularly shaped islets.
The model addresses the important clinical need of calculating the probability of tumor involvement in specific sub-volumes of the prostate, which is required for radiation treatment planning and other applications.

Spectral density characteristics of self-organized structuring in phase-synchronized oscillator ensembles

Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph); Chaotic Dynamics (nlin.CD)
The formation of coherent structures in developed turbulence can be described as a self-organization process, where macroscopic order emerges from a chaotic background through nonequilibrium phase transitions. We model this mechanism by simulating an ensemble of locally coupled classical oscillators, representing the oscillatory modes of fluctuation within a turbulent medium, which synchronize via a propagating Kuramoto-like interaction field. Upon synchronization, the system spontaneously self-organizes into dense structures, and we demonstrate a tendency for those structures to form quantized loop currents of phase information. These currents are governed by topological constraints that arise from statistical instabilities within the system's oscillatory interaction network. We show that the power spectral density of these emergent structures exhibits a stable, universal power-law behaviour, with spectral indices characteristic of natural plasma turbulence. These findings suggest that the statistical markers of turbulence can arise from universal principles of topological self-organization, independent of the system's specific physical constraints.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown growing potential in molecular sciences, but they often produce chemically inaccurate descriptions and struggle to recognize or justify potential errors. This raises important concerns about their robustness and reliability in scientific applications. To support more rigorous evaluation of LLMs in chemical reasoning, we present the MolErr2Fix benchmark, designed to assess LLMs on error detection and correction in molecular descriptions. Unlike existing benchmarks focused on molecule-to-text generation or property prediction, MolErr2Fix emphasizes fine-grained chemical understanding. It tasks LLMs with identifying, localizing, explaining, and revising potential structural and semantic errors in molecular descriptions. Specifically, MolErr2Fix consists of 1,193 fine-grained annotated error instances. Each instance contains quadruple annotations, i.e,. (error type, span location, the explanation, and the correction). These tasks are intended to reflect the types of reasoning and verification required in real-world chemical communication. Evaluations of current state-of-the-art LLMs reveal notable performance gaps, underscoring the need for more robust chemical reasoning capabilities. MolErr2Fix provides a focused benchmark for evaluating such capabilities and aims to support progress toward more reliable and chemically informed language models. All annotations and an accompanying evaluation API will be publicly released to facilitate future research.

SuperKEKB has achieved significantly higher specific luminosity than its predecessor KEKB, and it has proven a much more sustainable machine. It has successfully demonstrated several key design elements of FCC-ee. The design luminosity has not yet been reached, however. This observation is often (mistakenly) used to put into question the reliability of the FCC-ee design luminosity. In this note we review the accomplishments, challenges and obstacles of SuperKEKB, and compare these with the FCC-ee design.

Distributed force element decomposition with method of fundamental solutions

Subjects:
Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
Quantifying the contribution of vortex structures to pressure stress is useful for designing flow control strategies to mitigate low or drag. The traditional force-element method focuses on the contribution of vortex structures to the resultant force. However, the contribution of vortex structures to the distributed force can not be identified. To address this problem, a distributed force element method is proposed. This method projects the Navier-Stokes equation to a divergence-free space and obtain a Poisson equation for pressure. The Green's function is employed to express pressure stress on the solid boundary as a combination of volume and surface integrals. Contributions to the distributed source are divided into acceleration surface elements, vorticity surface elements, convection volume elements. The method of fundamental solutions and singular value decomposition are used to efficiently solve the Green's functions. The distributed force element method is validated using laminar flows around a stationary circular cylinder and oscillating circular cylinder, and three-dimensional laminar and turbulent flows around a sphere. In laminar flow over a circular cylinder, fluctuation of forces mainly originate from volume sources, while in flow over an oscillating circular cylinder, inertial and volume source terms may cancel out, suppressing lift fluctuation. In flows over a sphere, a strong negative volume source in the boundary layer on the sphere creates low-pressure regions, while pressure in the separated shear layer is close to zero.

Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE) noninvasively maps brain biomechanics and is highly sensitive to alterations associated with aging and neurodegenerative disease. Most implementations use a single frequency or a narrow frequency band, limiting the analysis of frequency-dependent viscoelastic parameters.
We developed a dual-actuator wideband MRE (5-50 Hz) protocol and acquired wavefields at 13 frequencies in 24 healthy adults (young: 23-39 years; older: 50-63 years). Shear wave speed (SWS) maps were generated as a proxy for stiffness, and SWS dispersion was modeled using Newtonian, Kelvin-Voigt, and power-law rheological models.
Whole-brain stiffness declined with age, with the strongest effect observed at low frequencies (5-16 Hz: -0.24%/year; p=0.019) compared with mid (20-35 Hz: -0.12%/year; p=0.030) and high frequencies (40-50 Hz: -0.10%/year; p=0.165). Compared to older brains, younger adults showed 14.3% higher baseline stiffness in the power-law model (p=0.001) and 8.5-9.0% higher viscosity according to the Newtonian and Kelvin-Voigt model (p<0.05). White and cortical gray matter exhibited similar age-related decreases, while deep gray matter showed an increase in the power-law exponent (+0.001/year; p=0.036), suggesting a transition toward more fluid-like properties associated with aging.
Wideband MRE revealed frequency-dependent and region-specific biomechanical alterations with aging, with the strongest effects observed at low frequencies. Extending brain MRE into the low frequency regime potentially enhances sensitivity to solid-fluid interactions. Therefore, low frequency MRE may serve as an early biomechanical marker of microstructural brain changes due to aging and neurodegeneration.

Low-Frequency Scattering of TE and TM Waves by an Inhomogeneous Medium with Planar Symmetry

Comments:

Optics (physics.optics); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
Stationary scattering of TE and TM waves propagating in an isotropic medium with planar symmetry is described by Bergmann's equation in one dimension. This is a generalization of Helmholtz equation which allows for developing transfer matrix methods to deal with the corresponding scattering problems. We use a dynamical formulation of stationary scattering to study the low-frequency scattering of these waves when the inhomogeneities of the medium causing the scattering are confined to a planar slab. This formulation relies on the construction of an effective two-level non-Hermitian quantum system whose time-evolution operator determines the transfer matrix. We use it to construct the low-frequency expansions of the transfer matrix and the reflection and transmission coefficients of the medium, introduce a generalization of Brewster's angle for inhomogeneous slabs at low frequencies, and derive analytic conditions for transparency and reflectionlessness of PT-symmetric and non-PT-symmetric slabs at these frequencies. We also discuss the application of this method to deal with the low-frequency scattering of TE and TM waves when the carrier medium occupies a half-space and the waves satisfy boundary conditions with planar symmetry at the boundary of the half-space. Because acoustic waves propagating in a compressible fluid with planar symmetry are also described by Bergmann's equation, our results apply to the low-frequency scattering of these waves.

Optimal Weights in a Two-Tier Voting System with Mean-Field Voters

We analyse two-tier voting systems with voters described by a multi-group mean-field model that allows for correlated voters both within groups as well as across group boundaries. In this model voters are influenced by voters within their group (constituency, member state, etc.) in a positive way. Across group boundaries positive or negative influence is considered. The objective is to determine the optimal weights each group receives in the council, the upper level of the voting system, to minimise the expected quadratic deviation of the council vote from a hypothetical referendum of the overall population in the large population limit. The mean-field model exhibits different behaviour depending on the intensity of interactions between voters. When interaction is weak, we obtain optimal weights given by the sum of a constant term and a term proportional to the square root of the group's population. When interaction is strong, the optimal weights are in general not uniquely determined. Indeed, when all groups are positively coupled, any assignation of weights is optimal. For two competing clusters of groups, the difference in total weights must be a specific number, but the assignation of weights within each cluster is arbitrary. We also obtain conditions for both interaction regimes under which it is impossible to reach the minimal democracy deficit as some of the weights may be negative.

Large-dimensional empirical data in science and engineering frequently have a low-rank structure and can be represented as a combination of just a few eigenmodes. Because of this structure, we can use just a few spatially localized sensor measurements to reconstruct the full state of a complex system. The quality of this reconstruction, especially in the presence of sensor noise, depends significantly on the spatial configuration of the sensors. Multiple algorithms based on gappy interpolation and QR factorization have been proposed to optimize sensor placement. Here, instead of an algorithm that outputs a single "optimal" sensor configuration, we take a statistical mechanics view to compute the full landscape of sensor interactions induced by the training data. The two key advances of this paper are the recasting of the sensor placement landscape in an Ising model form and a regularized reconstruction that significantly decreases reconstruction error for few sensors. In addition, we provide first uncertainty quantification of the sparse sensing reconstruction and open questions about the shape of reconstruction risk curve. Mapping out these data-induced sensor interactions allows combining them with external selection criteria and anticipating sensor replacement impacts.

Universality and scaling laws are hallmarks of equilibrium phase transitions and critical phenomena. However, extending these concepts to non-equilibrium systems is an outstanding challenge. Despite recent progress in the study of dynamical phases, the universality classes and scaling laws for non-equilibrium phenomena are far less understood than those in equilibrium. In this work, using a trapped-ion quantum simulator with single-spin resolution, we investigate the non-equilibrium nature of critical fluctuations following a quantum quench to the critical point. We probe the scaling of spin fluctuations after a series of quenches to the critical Hamiltonian of a long-range Ising model. With systems of up to 50 spins, we show that the amplitude and timescale of the post-quench fluctuations scale with system size with distinct universal critical exponents, depending on the quench protocol. While a generic quench can lead to thermal critical behavior, we find that a second quench from one critical state to another (i.e.~a double quench) results in a new universal non-equilibrium behavior, identified by a set of critical exponents distinct from their equilibrium counterparts. Our results demonstrate the ability of quantum simulators to explore universal scaling beyond equilibrium.

Negative energetic elasticity in gels challenges the conventional understanding of gel elasticity; despite extensive research, a concise explanation remains elusive. In this study, we use the weakly self-avoiding walk (the Domb-Joyce model; DJ model) and interacting self-avoiding walk (ISAW) to investigate the emergence of negative energetic elasticity in polymer chains. Using exact enumeration, we show that both the DJ model and ISAW exhibit negative energetic elasticity, which is caused by effective soft-repulsive interactions between polymer segments. Moreover, we find that a universal scaling law for the internal energy of both models, with a common exponent of $7/4$, holds consistently across both random-walk-self-avoiding-walk and self-avoiding-walk-neighbor-avoiding-walk crossovers. These findings suggest that negative energetic elasticity is a fundamental and universal property of polymer networks and chains.

Detecting the faint signal of continuous gravitational waves (CWs) stands as a major frontier in gravitational-wave astronomy, pushing the need for detectors whose sensitivity exceeds the standard quantum limit (SQL). Here, we propose an orbital optomechanical (OOM) sensor that exploits the sensitive coupling of an orbitally squeezed $p$-orbital Bose-Einstein condensate to spacetime distortions, enabling the detection of interferometer phase shifts induced by CWs. This sensor achieves a theoretical quantum-noise-limited sensitivity 16 dB below the SQL while reducing the required laser power by five orders of magnitude. The performance arises from a novel noise trade-off: a counter-propagating readout scheme suppresses photonic shot noise, while orbital squeezing minimizes the remaining atomic projection noise. By leveraging quantum control over atomic orbital degrees of freedom, this approach establishes a new framework for interferometric sensing with direct applications to the search for CWs and ultralight dark matter.

The study of spin-glass dynamics, long considered the paradigmatic complex system, has reached important milestones. The availability of single crystals has allowed the experimental measurement of spin-glass coherence lengths of almost macroscopic dimensions, while the advent of special-purpose computers enables dynamical simulations that approach experimental scales. This review provides an account of the quantitative convergence of these two avenues of research, with precise experimental measurements of the expected scaling laws and numerical reproduction of classic experimental results, such as memory and rejuvenation. The article opens with a brief review of the defining spin-glass properties, randomness and frustration, and their experimental consequences. These apparently simple characteristics are shown to generate rich and complex physics. Models are introduced that enable quantitative dynamical descriptions. After a summary of the main numerical results in equilibrium, paying particular attention to temperature chaos, this review examines off-equilibrium dynamics in the absence of a magnetic field and shows how it can be related to equilibrium structures through the fluctuation-dissipation relations. The nonlinear response at a given temperature is then developed, including experiments and scaling in the vicinity of the transition temperature $T_\mathrm{g}$. The consequences of temperature change $\unicode{x2013}$including temperature chaos, rejuvenation, and memory$\unicode{x2013}$ are reviewed. The interpretation of these phenomena requires identifying several length scales relevant to dynamics, which, in turn, generate new insights. Finally, issues for future investigations are introduced, including what is to be nailed down theoretically, why the Ising Edwards-Anderson model is so successful at modeling spin-glass dynamics, and experiments yet to be undertaken.

Recently, a formal analogy between the fluctuating diffusivity and thermodynamics has been proposed based on phenomena of heterogeneous diffusion observed in living cells. This not only offers the analogs of the quantity of heat and work as well as the internal energy but also achieves that of the Clausius inequality for the entropy concerning diffusivity fluctuations. Here, a discussion is developed about constructing a heat-like engine in terms of the fluctuating diffusivity. The engine constitutes two kinds of processes with the average diffusivity or the average local temperature being kept fixed, along which the fluctuation distribution obeys an exponential law. The efficiency of the engine in a cycle, which quantifies how much the diffusivity change as the analog of work can be extracted, is found to formally coincide with that of Carnot's. During the cycle, the total change of the entropy is also shown to vanish.

The excitation of bound states in the continuum (BICs) in two- or multi-qubit systems lies at the heart of entanglement generation and harnessing in Waveguide Quantum Electrodynamics platforms. However, the generation of qubit pair BICs through single-photon scattering is hindered by the fact that these states are effectively decoupled from propagating photons. We prove that scattering of a parity-invariant single photon on a qubit pair, combined with a properly engineered time variation of the qubit detuning, is not only feasible, but also more effective than strategies based on the relaxation of the excited states of the qubits when the distance between the qubits gives rise to non-negligible photon delays (non-Markovian regime). The use of tensor network methods to simulate the proposed scheme enables to include such photon delays in collision models, thus opening the possibility to follow the time evolution of the full quantum system, including qubits and field, and to efficiently implement and characterize the dynamics hence identifying optimal working points for the BIC generation.

We address the characterization of genuine network nonlocal correlations, which remains highly challenging due to the non-convex nature of local correlations even in the simplest scenario, and increasingly so when derived from entangled states that deviate from their ideal forms. We introduce a scalable causally-inferred Bayesian learning framework called the LHV layered neural network, which introduces the rank parameter of the non-ideal combined source state as an untapped resource to learn the local statistics in Bell tests. This reveals these correlations to persist close to the Bell states, with a noise robustness of 0.94-0.95 in the triangle scenario, additionally requiring all sources to send only entangled states with joint entangled measurements as resources. Further, we study the robustness of the genuineness to shared randomness in the network scenario. Apart from the results, the work succeeds in showing that machine learning approaches with foundational domain-specific constraints can greatly benefit the field of quantum foundations.

Robust Wave Splitters Based on Scattering Singularities in Complex non-Hermitian Systems

We have discovered specific conditions for generic scattering systems to act as wave splitters that are robust to any change in relative amplitude or phase of an arbitrary injected waveform. Specifically for complex systems with tunable parameters, these conditions for robust splitting (RS) are abundant, and by using multiple tunable parameters the relative amplitude and phase of the output signals can also be tuned. The splitting property of the systems works for all possible input phase differences and amplitude ratios and does not require a particular coherent input signal. We show experimentally that the fixed splitting ratios and output phases at RS conditions are robust to 100 dB of relative power and 2$\pi$ phase changes of the input waves to a complex non-Hermitian two-port system. We also demonstrate that the splitting power ratio can be tuned by multiple orders of magnitude and the RS conditions can be tuned to any desired frequency with suitable tunable perturbations embedded in the system. Although this phenomenon is realized in two-port systems and involves some degree of attenuation, tunable robust splitting can be achieved between any two ports of multiport systems. These results are general to all wave scattering phenomena (electromagnetic, acoustic, etc.) and hold in generic complex scattering systems.

We investigate Perfect Absorption (PA) of radiation, in which incoming energy is entirely dissipated, in a system consisting of molecular spin centers coherently coupled to a planar microwave resonator operated at milliKelvin temperature and in the single photon regime. This platform allows us to fine tune the spin-photon coupling and to control the effective dissipation of the two subsystems towards the environment, thus giving us the opportunity to span over a wide space of parameters. Our system can be effectively described by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian exhibiting distinct Hermitian subspaces. We experimentally show that these subspaces, linked to the presence of PA, can be engineered through the resonator-spin detuning, which controls the composition of the polaritons in terms of photon and spin content. In such a way, the required balance between the feeding and the loss rates is effectively recovered even in the absence of PT-symmetry. We show that Hermitian subspaces influence the overall aspect of coherent spectra of cavity QED systems and enlarge the possibility to explore non-Hermitian effects in open quantum systems. We finally discuss how our results can be potentially exploited for applications, in particular as single-photon switches and modulators.

We introduce ``Windbreaking-as-a-Service'' (WaaS) as an innovative approach to shared transportation in which larger ``windbreaker'' vehicles provide aerodynamic shelter for ``windsurfer'' vehicles, thereby reducing drag and fuel consumption. As a computational framework to solve the large-scale matching and assignment problems that arise in WaaS, we present \textbf{QUEST} (Quantum-Enhanced Shared Transportation). Specifically, we formulate the pairing of windbreakers and windsurfers -- subject to timing, speed, and vehicle-class constraints -- as a mixed-integer quadratic problem (MIQP). Focusing on a single-segment prototype, we verify the solution classically via the Hungarian Algorithm, a Gurobi-based solver, and brute-force enumeration of binary vectors. We then encode the problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) and map it to an Ising Hamiltonian, enabling the use of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and other quantum and classical annealing technologies. Our quantum implementation successfully recovers the optimal assignment identified by the classical methods, confirming the soundness of the QUEST pipeline for a controlled prototype. While QAOA and other quantum heuristics do not guarantee a resolution of the fundamental complexity barriers, this study illustrates how the WaaS problem can be systematically translated into a quantum-ready model. It also lays the groundwork for addressing multi-segment scenarios and potentially leveraging quantum advantage for large-scale shared-transportation instances.

Potential failures of physics-informed machine learning in traffic flow modeling: theoretical and experimental analysis

Machine Learning (cs.LG); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph)
This study investigates why physics-informed machine learning (PIML) can fail in macroscopic traffic flow modeling. We define failure as cases where a PIML model underperforms both purely data-driven and purely physics-based baselines by a given threshold. Unlike in other fields, physics residuals themselves do not hinder optimization in this setting. Instead, effective updates require both data and physics gradients to form acute angles with the true gradient, a condition difficult to satisfy with low-resolution loop data. In such cases, neural networks cannot accurately approximate density and speed, and the constructed physics residuals, already degraded by discrete sampling and temporal averaging, lose their ability to capture PDE dynamics, which directly leads to PIML failure. Theoretically, although LWR and ARZ solutions are weak solutions, for piecewise $C^k$ initial data they remain $C^k$ off the shock set under mild conditions, which has Lebesgue measure zero. Thus, almost all detector or collocation points lie in smooth regions where residuals are valid, and the MLP's inability to exactly represent discontinuities is immaterial. Finally, we establish MSE lower bounds of physics residuals: higher-order models such as ARZ have strictly larger consistency error bounds than LWR under mild conditions. This explains why LWR-based PIML can outperform ARZ-based PIML even with high-resolution data, with the gap shrinking as resolution increases, consistent with prior empirical findings.

In this work we use particle-in-cell (PIC) numerical simulations to study interaction of a spatially uniform electron beam with a rotational magnetic hole in a form of a Harris current sheet. We vary width of the Harris current sheet to investigate how this affects the quasi-linear relaxation, i.e. plateau formation of the bump-on-tail unstable electron beam. We find that when width of the Harris current sheet approaches and becomes smaller than the electron gyro-radius, quasi-linear relaxation becomes hampered and a positive slope in the electron velocity distribution function (VDF) persists. We explain this by the effects of non-conservation of electron magnetic moment, which, as recent works suggest, can maintain the positive slope of the VDF. In part, this can explain why some electron beams (the ones that interact with narrow magnetic holes with sharp boundaries, represented in our study by a Harris current sheet) in the solar wind travel much longer distances than predicted by the quasi-linear theory, at least in those cases when the electron beams slide along the current sheets that are abundant when the different-speed solar wind streams interact with each other.

In conventional magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs), the tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) typically increases with barrier thickness as electron transmission in the antiparallel configuration decays faster than that of the parallel configuration. In this work, we reveal an anomalous scaling effect in altermagnetic tunnel junctions (AMTJs), where the TMR decreases anomalously with an increasing barrier thickness. The anomalous scaling originates from the overlapping spin-split branches forming a transmission path that cannot be suppressed in the antiparallel state. Such phenomenon is explained by a double-barrier model and is further demonstrated using ab initio quantum transport simulations in 2D V2Te2O/Cr2Se2O/V2Te2O and V2Te2O/ZnSe/V2Te2O AMTJs. Our work identifies a peculiar unexpected transport characteristic of AMTJ, providing a fundamental limit on AMTJ device design and illustrating the potential optimal design of AMTJ at the ultrascaled monolayer limit.

Quantum simulation offers a route to study open-system molecular dynamics in non-perturbative regimes by programming the interactions among electronic, vibrational, and environmental degrees of freedom on similar energy scales. Trapped-ion systems possess this capability, with their native spins, phonons, and tunable dissipation integrated within a single platform. Here, we demonstrate an open-system quantum simulation of charge and exciton transfer in a multi-mode linear vibronic coupling model. Employing tailored spin-phonon interactions alongside reservoir engineering techniques, we emulate a system with two dissipative vibrational modes coupled to donor and acceptor electronic sites and follow its non-equilibrium dynamics. We continuously tune the system from the charge transfer (CT) regime to the vibrationally assisted exciton transfer (VAET) regime by controlling the vibronic coupling strengths. We find that degenerate modes enhance CT and VAET rates at large energy gaps, while non-degenerate modes activate slow-mode pathways that reduce the energy-gap dependence, thus enlarging the window for efficient transfer. These results show that the presence of one additional vibration introduces interfering vibrationally assisted pathways and reshapes non-perturbative quantum excitation transfer. Our work establishes a scalable and hardware-efficient route to simulating chemically relevant, many-mode vibronic processes with engineered environments, guiding the design of next-generation organic photovoltaics and molecular electronics.

This study investigates perturbation strategies inspired by adversarial attack principles from deep learning, designed to control synchronization dynamics through strategically crafted weak perturbations. We propose a gradient-based optimization method that identifies small phase perturbations to dramatically enhance or suppress collective synchronization in Kuramoto oscillator networks. Our approach formulates synchronization control as an optimization problem, computing gradients of the order parameter with respect to oscillator phases to determine optimal perturbation directions. Results demonstrate that extremely small phase perturbations applied to network oscillators can achieve significant synchronization control across diverse network architectures. Our analysis reveals that synchronization enhancement is achievable across various network sizes, while synchronization suppression becomes particularly effective in larger networks, with effectiveness scaling favorably with network size. The method is systematically validated on canonical model networks including scale-free and small-world topologies, and real-world networks representing power grids and brain connectivity patterns. This adversarial framework represents a novel paradigm for synchronization management by introducing deep learning concepts to networked dynamical systems.

High-dynamic-range (HDR) imaging is an essential technique for overcoming the dynamic range limits of image sensors. The classic method relies on multiple exposures, which slows capture time, resulting in motion artifacts when imaging dynamic scenes. Single-shot HDR imaging alleviates this issue by encoding HDR data into a single exposure, then computationally recovering it. Many established methods use strong image priors to recover improperly exposed image detail. These approaches struggle with extended highlight regions. We utilize the global reset release (GRR) shutter mode of an off-the-shelf sensor. GRR shutter mode applies a longer exposure time to rows closer to the bottom of the sensor. We use optics that relay a randomly permuted (shuffled) image onto the sensor, effectively creating spatially randomized exposures across the scene. The exposure diversity allows us to recover HDR data by solving an optimization problem with a simple total variation image prior. In simulation, we demonstrate that our method outperforms other single-shot methods when many sensor pixels are saturated (10% or more), and is competitive at a modest saturation (1%). Finally, we demonstrate a physical lab prototype that uses an off-the-shelf random fiber bundle for the optical shuffling. The fiber bundle is coupled to a low-cost commercial sensor operating in GRR shutter mode. Our prototype achieves a dynamic range of up to 73dB using an 8-bit sensor with 48dB dynamic range.

Finding process pathways in molecular simulations such as the unbinding paths of small molecule ligands from their binding sites at protein targets in a set of trajectories via unsupervised learning approaches requires the definition of a suitable similarity measure between trajectories. We here evaluate the performance of four such measures with varying degree of sophistication, i.e., Euclidean and Wasserstein distances, Procrustes analysis and dynamical time warping, when analyzing trajectory data from two different biased simulation driving protocols in the form of constant velocity constraint targeted MD and steered MD. In a streptavidin-biotin benchmark system with known ground truth clusters, Wasserstein distances yielded the best clustering performance, closely followed by Euclidean distances, both being the most computationally efficient similarity measures. In a more complex A2a receptor-inhibitor system, however, the simplest measure, i.e., Euclidean distances, was sufficient to reveal meaningful and interpretable clusters.

Complex networks have become essential tools for understanding diverse phenomena in social systems, traffic systems, biomolecular systems, and financial systems. Identifying critical nodes is a central theme in contemporary research, serving as a vital bridge between theoretical foundations and practical applications. Nevertheless, the intrinsic complexity and structural heterogeneity characterizing real-world networks, with particular emphasis on dynamic and higher-order networks, present substantial obstacles to the development of universal frameworks for critical node identification. This paper provides a comprehensive review of critical node identification techniques, categorizing them into seven main classes: centrality, critical nodes deletion problem, influence maximization, network control, artificial intelligence, higher-order and dynamic methods. Our review bridges the gaps in existing surveys by systematically classifying methods based on their methodological foundations and practical implications, and by highlighting their strengths, limitations, and applicability across different network types. Our work enhances the understanding of critical node research by identifying key challenges, such as algorithmic universality, real-time evaluation in dynamic networks, analysis of higher-order structures, and computational efficiency in large-scale networks. The structured synthesis consolidates current progress and highlights open questions, particularly in modeling temporal dynamics, advancing efficient algorithms, integrating machine learning approaches, and developing scalable and interpretable metrics for complex systems.

Coarse Graining Photo-Isomerization Reactions: Thermodynamic Consistency and Implications for Molecular Ratchets

Subjects:

We formulate thermodynamically consistent coarse-graining procedures for molecular systems undergoing thermally and photo-induced transitions: starting from elementary vibronic transitions, we derive effective photo-isomerization reactions interconverting ground-state species. Crucially, the local detailed balance condition, that constrains reaction kinetics to thermodynamics, remains satisfied throughout the coarse-graining procedures. It applies to the effective photo-isomerization reactions just as it does to the elementary vibronic transitions. We then demonstrate that autonomous photo-driven molecular ratchets operate via the same fundamental mechanism as chemically driven ones. Because the local detailed balance remains satisfied, autonomous photo-driven molecular ratchets, like chemically driven ones, operate exclusively through an information ratchet mechanism. This reveals that their design and optimization should prioritize molecular properties governing the information ratchet mechanism, rather than those influencing energetic bias.

Opinion formation in Wikipedia Ising networks

We study properties of opinion formation on Wikipedia Ising Networks. Each Wikipedia article is represented as a node and links are formed by citations of one article to another generating a directed network of a given language edition with millions of nodes. Ising spins are placed at each node and their orientation up or down is determined by a majority vote of connected neighbors. At the initial stage there are only a few nodes from two groups with fixed competing opinions up and down while other nodes are assumed to have no initial opinion with no effect on the vote. The competition of two opinions is modeled by an asynchronous Monte Carlo process converging to a spin polarized steady-state phase. This phase remains stable with respect to small fluctuations induced by an effective temperature of the Monte Carlo process. The opinion polarization at the steady-state provides opinion (spin) preferences for each node. In the framework of this Ising Network Opinion Formation model we analyze the influence and competition between political leaders, world countries and social concepts. This approach is also generalized to the competition between three groups of different opinions described by three colors, for example Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping or USA, Russia, China within English, Russian and Chinese editions of Wikipedia of March 2025. We argue that this approach provides a generic description of opinion formation in various complex networks.

Exploring the feasibility of probabilistic and deterministic quantum gates between T centers in silicon

Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Optics (physics.optics)
T center defects in silicon provide an attractive platform for quantum technologies due to their unique spin properties and compatibility with mature silicon technologies. We investigate several gate protocols between single T centers, including two probabilistic photon interference-based schemes, a near-deterministic photon scattering gate, and a deterministic magnetic dipole-based scheme. In particular, we study a photon interference-based scheme with feedback which can achieve success probabilities above 50%, and use the photon-count decomposition method to perform the first analytical calculations of its entanglement fidelity and efficiency while accounting for imperfections. We also calculate the fidelity and efficiency of the other schemes. Finally, we compare the performance of all the schemes, considering current and near-future experimental capabilities. In particular, we find that the photon interference-based scheme with feedback has the potential to achieve competitive efficiency and fidelity, making it interesting to explore experimentally.

Stability of Adiabatic States in a Dissipative Three-Level System

Subjects:
Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Optics (physics.optics)
The necessary and sufficient conditions for the stability of adiabatic states in three-level quantum systems are investigated analytically and numerically. Various possible configurations of three-level systems under exact two-photon resonance are considered. It is shown that in all these schemes, the lifetime of the studied states is determined by the dephasing time between levels that are not connected by a dipole transition. An efficient population transfer through the b-state at room temperature is demonstrated despite relatively long relaxation times. It is also demonstrated that, in case of large one-photon detuning, the so-called b-state has the same lifetime as that of the dark state. The evolution of adiabatic states for arbitrary values of single-photon detunings has been studied numerically.

Quantifying model prediction sensitivity to model-form uncertainty

Model-form uncertainty (MFU) in assumptions made during physics-based model development is widely considered a significant source of uncertainty; however, there are limited approaches that can quantify MFU in predictions extrapolating beyond available data. As a result, it is challenging to know how important MFU is in practice, especially relative to other sources of uncertainty in a model, making it difficult to prioritize resources and efforts to drive down error in model predictions. To address these challenges, we present a novel method to quantify the importance of uncertainties associated with model assumptions. We combine parameterized modifications to assumptions (called MFU representations) with grouped variance-based sensitivity analysis to measure the importance of assumptions. We demonstrate how, in contrast to existing methods addressing MFU, our approach can be applied without access to calibration data. However, if calibration data is available, we demonstrate how it can be used to inform the MFU representation, and how variance-based sensitivity analysis can be meaningfully applied even in the presence of dependence between parameters (a common byproduct of calibration).

The generation of dense electron-positron pair beams in the laboratory can enable direct tests of theoretical models of $\gamma$-ray bursts and active galactic nuclei. We have successfully achieved this using ultra-relativistic protons accelerated by the Super Proton Synchrotron at CERN. In the first application of this experimental platform, the stability of the pair beam is studied as it propagates through a metre-length plasma, analogous to TeV $\gamma$-ray induced pair cascades in the intergalactic medium. It has been argued that pair beam instabilities disrupt the cascade, thus accounting for the observed lack of reprocessed GeV emission from TeV blazars. If true this would remove the need for a moderate strength intergalactic magnetic field to explain the observations. We find that the pair beam instability is suppressed if the beam is not perfectly collimated or monochromatic, hence the lower limit to the intergalactic magnetic field inferred from $\gamma$-ray observations of blazars is robust.

Electronic order induced symmetry breaking in lattice dynamics of Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$
Shuai Zhang, Mengqi Wang, Tiantian Zhang
Subjects:
Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph)
Based on the molecular Berry curvature (MBC) framework, we develop an \textit{ab initio} algorithm to capture the quantitative effects of magnetic order on lattice dynamics. Using the ferromagnetic Weyl semimetal Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ as a prototype, we show that electronic-order-driven phonon symmetry breaking requires spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and leads to an MBC term that breaks both time-reversal ($\mathcal{T}$) and mirror symmetries. We demonstrate that mirror-symmetry breaking is essential to account for the experimentally observed phonon splitting, $\mathcal{T}$-breaking alone is insufficient. The MBC is widely distributed across the Brillouin zone, giving rise to significant off-$\Gamma$ effects. Our results show the phonon splitting of the $E_g$ and $E_u$ modes have distinct origins: the $E_g$ splitting arises from MBC and is captured by our algorithm, while the $E_u$ splitting stems from correlation-sensitive Fano resonance, explaining their asymmetric experimental line shapes. We provide a design strategy and computational pathway for materials with large phonon magnetism and splitting, requiring SOC, electron-phonon coupling, and ideally flat bands at the Fermi level. This work also suggests new avenues for controlling non-reciprocal phonon transport.

Structure-Preserving High-Order Methods for the Compressible Euler Equations in Potential Temperature Formulation for Atmospheric Flows

Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA); Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics (physics.ao-ph); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph)
We develop structure-preserving numerical methods for the compressible Euler equations, employing potential temperature as a prognostic variable. We construct three numerical fluxes designed to ensure the conservation of entropy and total energy within the discontinuous Galerkin framework on general curvilinear meshes. Furthermore, we introduce a generalization for the kinetic energy preservation property and total energy conservation in the presence of a gravitational potential term. To this end, we adopt a flux-differencing approach for the discretization of the source term, treated as non-conservative product. We present well-balanced schemes for different constant background states for both formulations (total energy and potential temperature) on curvilinear meshes. Finally, we validate the methods by comparing the potential temperature formulation with the traditional Euler equations formulation across a range of classical atmospheric scenarios.
