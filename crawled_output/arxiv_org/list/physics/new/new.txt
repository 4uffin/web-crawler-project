Title:
CNN-BiLSTM for sustainable and non-invasive COVID-19 detection via salivary ATR-FTIR spectroscopy
Anisio P. Santos Junior, Robinson Sabino-Silva, Mário Machado Martins, Thulio Marquez Cunha, Murillo G. Carneiro

Medical Physics (physics.med-ph); Machine Learning (cs.LG)
The COVID-19 pandemic has placed unprecedented strain on healthcare systems and remains a global health concern, especially with the emergence of new variants. Although real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is considered the gold standard for COVID-19 detection, it is expensive, time-consuming, labor-intensive, and sensitive to issues with RNA extraction. In this context, ATR-FTIR spectroscopy analysis of biofluids offers a reagent-free, cost-effective alternative for COVID-19 detection. We propose a novel architecture that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks, referred to as CNN-BiLSTM, to process spectra generated by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy and diagnose COVID-19 from spectral samples. We compare the performance of this architecture against a standalone CNN and other state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that our CNN-BiLSTM model outperforms all other models, achieving an average accuracy and F1-score of 0.80 on a challenging real-world COVID-19 dataset. The addition of the BiLSTM layer to the CNN architecture significantly enhances model performance, making CNN-BiLSTM a more accurate and reliable choice for detecting COVID-19 using ATR-FTIR spectra of non-invasive saliva samples.

GPU-Accelerated MATLAB Software for Atom-Ion Dynamics
Saajid Chowdhury, Jesús Pérez-Ríos
Subjects:
Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph); Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph)
We present a MATLAB script which can use GPU acceleration to simulate a trapped ion interacting with a low-density cloud of atoms. This script, called atomiongpu.m, can massively parallelize MD simulations of trajectories of a trapped ion and an atom starting far away. The script uses ode45gpu, which is our optimized and specialized implementation of the Runge-Kutta algorithm used in MATLAB's ODE solver ode45. We first discuss the physical system and show how ode45gpu can solve it up to 22x faster than MATLAB's ode45. Then, we show how to easily modify the inputs to atomiongpu.m to account for different kinds of atoms, ions, atom-ion interactions, trap potentials, simulation parameters, initial conditions, and computational hardware, so that atomiongpu.m automatically finds the probability of complex formation, the distribution of observables such as the scattering angle and complex lifetime, and plots of specific trajectories.

Closing a catenary loop: the lariat chain, the string shooter, and the heavy elastica
A. R. Dehadrai, J. A. Hanna
Subjects:
Classical Physics (physics.class-ph); Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
We review, critique, and extend results related to the problem of closed loop shape equilibria of a string shooter, a type of catenary consisting of steady, axially moving configurations of an inertial, inextensible, perfectly flexible string in the presence of gravity and drag forces. We highlight recurring misconceptions, and relate to similar problems, including the lariat (no gravity), chain fountain (not closed), and heavy \emph{elastica} (bending stiffness). We focus on the difficulty inherent to continuing a catenary through a vertical orientation, necessary to close a loop, which difficulty changes in nature as the system undergoes bifurcations with increasing drag. We construct solutions by implementing available analytical results, and numerically generate additional solutions with added bending stiffness. We briefly discuss global balances of linear, angular, and pseudo- momentum for this system.

Shock wave bending around a dusty plasma void

Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph)
We report on experimental observations of the bending of a dust acoustic shock wave around a dust void region. This phenomenon occurs as a planar shock wavefront encounters a compressible obstacle in the form of a void whose size is larger than the wavelength of the wave. As they collide, the central portion of the wavefront, that is the first to touch the void, is blocked while the rest of the front continues to propagate, resulting in an inward bending of the shock wave. The bent shock wave eventually collapses, leading to the transient trapping of dust particles in the void. Subsequently, a Coulomb explosion of the trapped particles generates a bow shock. The experiments have been carried out in a DC glow discharge plasma, where the shock wave and the void are simultaneously created as self-excited modes of a three-dimensional dust cloud. The salient features of this phenomenon are reproduced in molecular dynamics simulations, which provide valuable insights into the underlying dynamics of this interaction.

Vibrational corrections to molecular properties including relativistic corrections at the level of the Zeroth-Order Regular Approximation
Louise Møller Jessen, Ronan Gleeson, Lars Hemmingsen, Stephan P. A. Sauer
Subjects:
Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph)
The vibrational averaging module of the Dalton Project was extended to work also with the Amsterdam Density Functional (ADF) program, making it possible to calculate vibrational corrections to properties and at the same time include a treatment of relativistic effects for heavier atoms at the level of the Zeroth-Order Regular Approximation (ZORA). To illustrate the importance of the relativistic contributions, zero-point vibrational corrections were calculated for the electric field gradient tensor and the two NMR parameters, the isotropic shielding and the spin-spin coupling constants (SSCC), of selected mercury compounds. For all three properties, the vibrational corrected values performed closest to experimental values, and the magnitudes of the corrections depended on the level of relativity and the basis set in the calculation.

Mapping continuous-variable quantum states onto optical scalar beams

Subjects:
Optics (physics.optics)
Optical fields provide an accessible platform to explore connections between classical and quantum mechanics. We introduce a group-theoretic framework based on the $\mathrm{su}(1,1)$ Lie algebra to construct classical analogs of continuous-variable quantum states using the spatial degree of freedom of paraxial scalar beams. Our framework maps squeezed number states onto scalar beams expanded in orthonormal Gaussian modal bases, encompassing both Gaussian and non-Gaussian classical analogs, including one- and two-mode squeezed beams. To characterize the structural changes induced by squeezing, we examine phase-space redistribution through Fourier analysis and optical Wigner distribution functions. We derive analytical expressions for the waist, curvature, and Gouy phase of two-mode squeezed Laguerre-Gaussian beams, and establish a relation between the number of accessible modes and the achievable squeezing under finite numerical aperture. While squeezing introduces spatial and spectral correlations that reshape the beam structure, these beams remain constrained by the diffraction limit, as confirmed by the numerical propagation of apodized beams. These correlations give rise to classical entanglement. We establish a classical analog of the Duan--Simon inseparability criterion for continuous-variable two-mode Gaussian states. For non-Gaussian squeezed states, we analyze the marginal optical Wigner distribution functions and identify phase-space features, such as negativity, that act as witnesses of classical continuous-variable entanglement. Our framework unifies classical analogs of continuous-variable quantum states through beam engineering, enabling quantum-inspired applications in optical imaging, metrology, and communication.

Optics (physics.optics)
The space-bandwidth product (SBP) imposes a fundamental limitation in achieving high-resolution and large field-of-view image acquisitions simultaneously. High-NA objectives provide fine structural detail at the cost of reduced spatial coverage and slower scanning as compared to a low-NA objective, while low-NA objectives offer wide fields of view but compromised resolution. Here, we introduce LensPlus, a deep learning-based framework that enhances the SBP of quantitative phase imaging (QPI) without requiring hardware modifications. By training on paired datasets acquired with low-NA and high-NA objectives, LensPlus learns to recover high-frequency features lost in low-NA measurements, effectively bridging the resolution gap while preserving the large field of view and thereby increasing the SBP. We demonstrate that LensPlus can transform images acquired with a 10x/0.3 NA objective (40x/0.95 NA for another model) to a quality comparable to that obtained using a 40x/0.95 NA objective (100x/1.45 NA for the second model), resulting in an SBP improvement of approximately 1.87x (1.43x for the second model). Importantly, unlike adversarial models, LensPlus employs a non-generative model to minimize image hallucinations and ensure quantitative fidelity as verified through spectral analysis. Beyond QPI, LensPlus is broadly applicable to other lens-based imaging modalities, enabling wide-field, high-resolution imaging for time-lapse studies, large-area tissue mapping, and applications where high-NA oil objectives are impractical.

A simplified version of the semi-localized transitions (SLT) model is derived. The SLT-QE5 approximation reduces the number of differential equations from seven to five. Numerical calculations show that the approximation is very good for various trap parameters except the case with large reduction of activation energy during recombination to adjacent hole together with very low retrapping coefficient.

Next-generation cryogenic transmission electron microscopes (TEM) aim to achieve high-resolution imaging at ultracold sample temperatures (< 90 K) and over extended hold times. Lower temperatures enable atomic-scale characterization with improved beam and dose resilience for organic specimens and access to emergent electronic phases in quantum materials. Side-entry liquid helium cooling stages presently lack the mechanical and thermal stability required to support sub-Angstrom information transfer in modern TEM. Here we demonstrate sub-Angstrom atomic imaging TEM with a side-entry stage at specimen temperatures down to ~20K and with low stage drift and stable hold times.

The Mass and Velocity of Light from Energy and Momentum Conservation
Volodimir Simulik, Denys I. Bondar
Subjects:
Optics (physics.optics); Physics Education (physics.ed-ph)
While the numerical value of the speed of light is known with extraordinary precision, its theoretical definition remains a subject of fundamental interest. We show that the definition of mass and velocity of light follow from the conserved quantities of the electromagnetic field. The proposed definition of the speed of light is always bounded from above by the phase velocity and equals it for plane waves. As a consequence, we obtain a generalization of Einstein's mass-energy relation for electromagnetic fields in media: $m = \varepsilon\mu E / c^2$. Hence, irrespective of the light's intensity, the electromagentic field in near-zero-index material is always massless. This approach offers new pedagogical insights into the fundamental nature of light propagation.

A 5.9 GHz Sezawa SAW Acoustic Delay Line Based on Al0.6Sc0.4N-on-Sapphire with Propagation Q-factor > 3,000

Subjects:
Applied Physics (physics.app-ph)
In this work, we demonstrate a high-performance surface acoustic wave (SAW) delay line based on a Scandium alloyed aluminum nitride (AlScN)-on-sapphire platform operating at 5.9 GHz with an exceptionally high acoustic propagation Q-factor. An 800 nm AlScN thin film with 40% scandium alloying concentration was deposited on a thick sapphire substrate to achieve strong acoustic energy confinement and large electromechanical coupling effect, thereby minimizing the insertion loss (IL) and propagation loss (PL) of the acoustic delay line (ADL). The proposed ADL was designed to operate in the Sezawa mode using a Single-Phase Unidirectional Transducer (SPUDT) electrode configuration for better unidirectionality. The fabricated ADLs with different delay lengths, after conjugate matching, exhibited delay times spanning 13 to 214 ns and IL ranging from 7.6 to 18.3 dB. The extracted PL reached as low as 9.2 dB/mm at 5.9 GHz, with a group velocity (v_g) of around 5,779 m/s. Based on these results, the proposed ADLs exhibit a high acoustic propagation Q-factor of 3,044. These findings highlight the potential of AlScN-on-sapphire platforms for high operational frequency, low-loss SAW ADL devices in advanced RF applications.

This case study used individual interviews to investigate graduate student sense-making in upper-level electrostatics in the context of problems that can be efficiently solved for the electric potential using \v{Laplace}s equation. Although there are many technical mathematical issues involved in solving \v{Laplace}s equation, the focus of this research is not on those issues. Instead, the focus is on structural issues such as whether students recognize when solving \v{Laplace}s equation would be an effective approach to finding the potential and set up the problems correctly, and whether they can draw the electric field lines and equipotential surfaces in a given situation. Although many prior investigations have shed light on student sensemaking in the introductory physics contexts, very few investigations have focused on graduate student sensemaking while solving advanced physics problems. We present the findings of our research which was conducted through the lens of the epistemic game framework proposed by Tuminaro and Redish. We observe different nested epistemic games played by students.

Remarkable advances in quantum information science and technology (QIST) have taken place in recent years. However, they have also been accompanied by widespread misinformation. This paper provides suggestions for how educators can help students at all levels and especially early learners including those at the pre-college and college levels learn key QIST concepts so that they are less likely to be misinformed, e.g., by online unvetted resources. We discuss findings from interviews with five college educators, who are quantum researchers, about their views on countering misinformation in QIST and provide suggestions for how educators can help their students learn QIST concepts so that they do not become misinformed.

Traditional numerical global climate models simulate the full Earth system by exchanging boundary conditions between separate simulators of the atmosphere, ocean, sea ice, land surface, and other geophysical processes. This paradigm allows for distributed development of individual components within a common framework, unified by a coupler that handles translation between realms via spatial or temporal alignment and flux exchange. Following a similar approach adapted for machine learning-based emulators, we present SamudrACE: a coupled global climate model emulator which produces centuries-long simulations at 1-degree horizontal, 6-hourly atmospheric, and 5-daily oceanic resolution, with 145 2D fields spanning 8 atmospheric and 19 oceanic vertical levels, plus sea ice, surface, and top-of-atmosphere variables. SamudrACE is highly stable and has low climate biases comparable to those of its components with prescribed boundary forcing, with realistic variability in coupled climate phenomena such as ENSO that is not possible to simulate in uncoupled mode.

Aerophilic Debubbling

Subjects:
Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn); Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)
In this letter, we characterize quantitatively the complex phenomenon of debubbling via aerophilic membranes by examining local interactions at the scale of single bubbles. We identify three asymptotic limits of evacuation dictated by Rayleigh, Ohnesorge and Darcy dynamics, the physics of which we capture using simple scaling laws. We show that beyond a threshold permeability, bubble evacuations become constant in time - a feature we understand as an inertio-capillary limit. Our experiments reveal that the fastest bubble evacuations require an interface that is nearly a liquid, but not quite.

Enhanced Hydrodynamic Modeling of Offshore Wind Turbines using Morison's Equation with Frequency-Dependent Coefficients
Md Sakif, Doyal Sarker, Kazi Mohsin, Tri Ngo, Tuhin Das
Subjects:
Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics (physics.ao-ph)
This paper presents a novel approach for implementing frequency-dependent hydrodynamic coefficients in Morison's equation, which is widely used in hydrodynamics modeling. Accurate hydrodynamic predictions using Morison's equation necessitate the incorporation of frequency-dependent drag coefficients due to their variation with wave frequency. To address this, the proposed method segments the frequency domain into different regions, such as low-frequency (resonance) and high-frequency (wave) regions. Instead of using a constant drag coefficient across the entire spectrum, different drag coefficients are assigned to these regions. To implement this, a fifth-order low-pass Butterworth velocity filter is applied for the resonance zone, while a first-order high-pass Butterworth velocity filter is applied for the wave-dominated zone. The approach is validated using the INO WINDMOOR 12MW semisubmersible offshore wind turbine, comparing the simulation results against the experimental data. By incorporating frequency-dependent drag coefficients, the model shows improved agreement with experimental surge motion data across both frequency regions, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Thermal Transport of GaN/Substrate Heterostructures under Non-Uniform Heat Source

Subjects:
Applied Physics (physics.app-ph)
Heat generated in gallium nitride (GaN) high-electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs) is often concentrated in nanoscale regions and must dissipate through multiple heterostructures. However, the influence of non-uniform heat sources on the thermal transport of such heterostructures remains unclear. In this work, a thermal transport model for heterostructures under the non-uniform heat source is developed by combining first-principles calculations with Monte Carlo simulations. Temperature, heat flux, and spectral thermal conductance distributions are compared between uniform and non-uniform heat sources. The effects of heterostructure height, heat source width, and heat source height on thermal transfer characteristics are analyzed for four typical heterostructures: GaN/AlN, GaN/Diamond, GaN/Si, and GaN/SiC. The results reveal that non-uniform heat sources have little effect on average interfacial thermal conductance but induce pronounced local non-uniformity when the heterostructure height is small. The interfacial thermal conductance near the heat source region is significantly higher than that in other areas. As the heat source non-uniformity increases, the total thermal resistance of the heterostructure rises markedly, reaching several times that under uniform heat sources. Finite-element calculations fail to capture the combined effects of non-uniform heating and microscale dimensions, leading to a severe underestimation of heterostructure total thermal resistance. This work reveals the thermal transport mechanisms of heterostructures under non-uniform heat sources and provides theoretical guidance for the thermal design of wide-bandgap semiconductor devices.

Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
We develop, simulate and extend an initial proposition by Chaves et al. concerning a random incompressible vector field able to reproduce key ingredients of three-dimensional turbulence in both space and time. In this first article, we focus on the important underlying Gaussian structure that will be generalized in a second article to account for higher-order statistics. Presently, the statistical spatial structure of this velocity field is consistent with a divergence-free fractional Gaussian vector field that encodes all known properties of homogeneous and isotropic fluid turbulence at a given finite Reynolds number, up to second-order statistics. The temporal structure of the velocity field is introduced through a stochastic evolution of the respective Fourier modes. In the simplest picture, Fourier modes evolve according to an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, where the characteristic time scale depends on the wave-vector amplitude. For consistency with direct numerical simulations (DNSs) of the Navier-Stokes equations, this time scale is inversely proportional to the wave vector amplitude. As a consequence, the characteristic velocity that governs the eddies is independent of their size and is related to the velocity standard deviation, which is consistent with some features of the so-called sweeping effect. To ensure differentiability in time while respecting the causal nature of the evolution, we use the methodology developed by Viggiano et al. to propose a fully consistent stochastic picture, predicting in particular proper temporal covariance of the Fourier modes. We finally derive analytically all statistical quantities in a continuous setup and develop precise and efficient numerical schemes of the corresponding periodic framework. Both exact predictions and numerical estimations of the model are compared to DNSs provided by the Johns Hopkins database.

The components of the radial correlation energy density are calculated and analyzed for the atoms from He to Ar. The components include the nucleus-electron potential correlation energy density, the kinetic correlation energy density and the electron-electron potential correlation energy density. The necessary correlated one and two-electron density matrices are obtained from the Extrapolated-Full-Configuration-Interaction (exFCI) wave function where the reference wave function is restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF) or restricted open-shell Hartree-Fock (ROHF) depending on whether the atom is closed or open-shell. The accuracy associated with integrating the HF and exFCI energy density components, and the correlation energy density components, is evaluated on the SG-1 and SG-2 atomic grids. The SG-1 grid provides atomic energies that are accurate to about 1 kJ mol$^{-1}$, with the exception of the kinetic energy. The SG-2 grid is required for the analysis of atomic kinetic energies and more subtle energetic effects. There is also a significant amount of integration error cancellation in the correlation energy densities. The radial correlation energy densities display notable shell structure, and there is a substantial difference between the $\alpha$ and $\beta$-electron correlation energy densities for the open-shell atoms.

Unidirectional and collective emission of integrated quantum emitters

Subjects:
Optics (physics.optics); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
Unidirectional emission holds significant potential for advancing integrated photonics and quantum information technologies. However, the inherent randomness of spontaneous emission fundamentally makes its efficient realization rather challenging. To address this, here we develop a quantitative metric -- iso-frequency contour straightness and implement Fourier-transform analysis of radiation patterns to systematically evaluate directional quality of emission in photonic crystal (PhC) slabs. Through structural optimization, we demonstrate single-emitter radiation efficiency enhancement while maintaining low-loss unidirectional propagation. Furthermore, by strategically positioning multi-emitter arrays within PhC platforms, we simultaneously achieve scalable intensity amplification and superradiant emission via cooperative effects. This synergy of photonic band engineering and collective emitter coupling is able to realize unprecedented spatiotemporal coherence control in quantum emitter arrays.

Heavy metal-free quantum-dot light-emitting devices (QD-LEDs) have demonstrated remarkable brightness, saturated color, and high efficiencies across a broad spectral range. However, in contrast to organic LEDs (OLEDs), QD-LED operational lifetimes remain limited, with the underlying degradation mechanisms not fully understood. In the present study, we show that InP/ZnSe/ZnS (red-emitting) and ZnTeSe/ZnSe/ZnS (blue-emitting) cadmium-free colloidal QD-LEDs undergo nanoscale morphological changes during operation. Specifically,interparticle coarsening and layer thinning are observed in the electron transport layer (ETL) consisting of ZnMgO nanoparticles (NPs), in the QD emissive layer, and in the organic hole transport layer. This is accompanied by the generation and diffusion of compositional oxygen- and hydrogen-radicals throughout the device, with oxygen accumulating at the electrode/ETL interfance. Moreover, in situ transmission electron microscopy reveals the electron beam exposure, in the presence of hydrogen radicals, accelerates ZnMgO NPs coarsening. To mitigate these degradation pathway, we show that acrylate-based resin-encapsulation treatment stabilize the ETL/QD layers by suppressing the radical formation and halting morphology changes. This approach achieves dramatic stability enhancements, exhibits an 8-fold and 5000-fold lifetime improvement on InP/ZnSe/ZnS and ZnTeSe/ZnSe/ZnS QD-LEDs, respectively. Our findings establish the causal relationships between the morphological degradation, interlayer radical dynamics, and state-of-the-art QD-LEDs instability, providing new insights into a scalable encapsulation treatment that enables efficient and long-lived Cd-free QD-LEDs.

Recent advancements have led to the development of bright and heavy metal-free blue-emitting quantum dot light-emitting diodes (QLEDs). However, consensus understanding of their distinct photophysical and electroluminescent dynamics remains elusive. This work correlates the chemical and electronic changes occurring in a QLED during operation using depth-resolved and operando techniques. The results indicate that oxygen vacancy forms in the ZnMgO layer during operation, with important implications on the charge injection and electrochemical dynamics. Taken together, the results suggest a causal relationship between oxygen vacancy formation and operational degradation of the blue-emitting ZnSeTe-based QLEDs.

Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph)
This study presents a large database validation of the Gyro Fluid System (GFS) model for linear gyrokinetic stability for high-mode (H-mode) edge transport barrier conditions in the National Spherical Torus Experiment (NSTX) tokamak. The database of linear stability calculations with the CGYRO gyrokinetic code was produced using plasma profile measurements from NSTX discharges to identify kinetic ballooning modes (KBM), trapped electron modes (TEM), and micro-tearing modes (MTM) that limit the pressure profile gradient in the H-mode barrier. A novel Bayesian optimization approach determines optimal resolution parameters for GFS specifically for spherical tokamak pedestal conditions. Our results demonstrate that GFS, with optimized resolution, can achieve accurate linear stability analysis in NSTX pedestal conditions for reduced resolution compared to CGYRO. GFS can accurately find the KBM, TEM, and MTM instability branches. Parametric analysis reveals that GFS accuracy in this extreme pedestal parameter range is degraded for low magnetic shear and near the separatrix conditions. These findings establish GFS as a fast linear eigenmode solver for spherical tokamak pedestal gyrokinetic stability and demonstrate a systematic methodology for determining the optimum resolution settings.

Magnetic reconnection is a fundamental and omnipresent energy conversion process in plasma physics. Novel observations of fields and particles from Parker Solar Probe (PSP) have shown the absence of reconnection in a large number of current sheets in the near-Sun solar wind. Using near-Sun observations from PSP Encounters 4 to 11 (Jan 2020 to March 2022), we investigate whether reconnection onset might be suppressed by velocity shear. We compare estimates of the tearing mode growth rate in the presence of shear flow for time periods identified as containing reconnecting current sheets versus non-reconnecting times, finding systematically larger growth rates for reconnection periods. Upon examination of the parameters associated with reconnection onset, we find that 85% of the reconnection events are embedded in slow, non-Alfvenic wind streams. We compare with fast, slow non-Alfvenic, and slow Alfvenic streams, finding that the growth rate is suppressed in highly Alfvenic fast and slow wind and reconnection is not seen in these wind types, as would be expected from our theoretical expressions. These wind streams have strong Alfvenic} flow shear, consistent with the idea of reconnection suppression by such flows. This could help explain the frequent absence of reconnection events in the highly Alfvenic, near-Sun solar wind observed by PSP. Finally, we find a steepening of both the trace and magnitude magnetic field spectra within reconnection periods in comparison to ambient wind. We tie this to the dynamics of relatively balanced turbulence within these reconnection periods and the potential generation of compressible fluctuations.

Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph)
This paper presents a second-order model of capacity drop at expressway lane-drop bottlenecks. The model is an extension of Jin's model (Jin, 2017). This model captures not only the stationary state associated with the capacity drop but also the transitional dynamics leading from the onset of congestion to that state. The characteristics of the proposed model are examined theoretically and umerically. The results show that the capacity drop stationary state is stable and is reached immediately once congestion occurs. Furthermore, we validate the model using empirical data. The results suggest that the model has the potential to provide new insights into congestion phenomena at expressway lane-drop bottlenecks.

Transonic buffet is a well-known aerodynamic instability of shock/boundary layer interaction in the transonic regime for aircraft. So far, this phenomenon has typically been investigated by modal and correlation analyses. Here, we present a perspective on low-frequency unsteadiness, of the order of St ~ O(-2), in transonic buffet, using results from temporal evolution of skin friction lines and correlation analysis on the surface of Benchmark Supercritical Wing (BSCW) with an aspect ratio AR = 2. Skin friction lines and critical point theory are well established to describe 3D separated flows based on critical points -- nodes, foci, and saddles. Dynamics of these critical points are found in a certain topology in separation regions for different angles of attack, Mach 0.85, and Reynolds number 4.491 million. The topology of critical points consists of pairs of contra-rotating unstable foci that contribute to the mechanism of formation and propagation of buffet cells -- pockets of shock foot oscillations. The dynamic nature of these critical points changes the pressure distribution on the surface, which is reflected as wave propagation in correlation plots.

The propagation path of topologically protected states is bound to the interface between regions with different topology, and as such, the functionality of linear photonic devices leveraging these states is fixed during fabrication. Here, we propose a mechanism for dynamic control over a driven dissipative system's local topology, yielding reconfigurable topological interfaces and thus tunable paths for protected routing. We illustrate our approach in non-resonantly pumped polariton lattices, where the nonlinear interaction between the polaritons and the exciton reservoir due to non-resonant pumping can yield a dynamical change of the topology. Moreover, using a continuous model of the polariton system based on a driven-dissipative Gross-Pitaevskii equation alongside the spectral localizer framework, we show that the local changes in the nonlinear non-Hermitian system's topology are captured by a local Chern marker. Looking forward, we anticipate such reconfigurable topological routing will enable the realization of novel classes of topological photonic devices.

This study examines the relaminarization of turbulent puffs in pipe flow using highly resolved direct numerical simulations at Reynolds numbers of 1880, 1900, and 1920. The exponential decay of the total energy of streamwise velocity fluctuations and the weak dependence of the decay rate on the Reynolds number were verified. In the cross-section of the laminar-turbulent interface at the trailing edge of the puff, an analysis of the spatio-temporal evolution of the streamline patterns reveals a complex topology with saddle-node pairs. In this case, the saddle and the node move toward each other during relaminarization until they collide and vanish. By tracing the vanishing saddle-node pairs over time, we discovered that the distance between the saddle and the node scales as a square root function of time, a generic characteristic of a time-evolving saddle-node bifurcation.

Crystals and other condensed phases are defined primarily by their inherent symmetries, which play a crucial role in dictating their structural properties. In crystallization studies, local order parameters (OPs) that describe bond orientational order are widely employed to investigate crystal formation. Despite their utility, these traditional metrics do not directly quantify symmetry, an important aspect for understanding the development of order during crystallization. To address this gap, we introduce a new set of OPs, called Point Group Order Parameters (PGOPs), designed to continuously quantify point group symmetry order. We demonstrate the strength and utility of PGOP in detecting order across different crystalline systems and compare its performance to commonly used bond-orientational order metrics. PGOP calculations for all non-infinite point groups are implemented in the open-source package SPATULA (Symmetry Pattern Analysis Toolkit for Understanding Local Arrangements), written in parallelized C++ with a Python interface. The code is publicly available on GitHub.

Quantum computing offers a promising platform to address the computational challenges inherent in quantum chemistry, and particularly in valence bond (VB) methods, which are chemically appealing but suffer from high computational cost due to the use of nonorthogonal orbitals. While various fermionic-to-spin mappings exist for orthonormal spin orbitals, such as the widely used Jordan-Wigner transformations, an analogous framework for nonorthogonal spin orbitals remains undeveloped. In this work, we propose an alternative Jordan-Wigner-type mapping tailored for the nonorthogonal case, with the goal of enabling efficient quantum simulations of VB-type wavefunctions. Our approach paves the way towards the development of chemically interpretable and computationally feasible valence bond algorithms on near-term quantum devices. An initial theoretical analysis and a preliminary application demonstrate the feasibility of this encoding and its potential for extending the applicability of VB methods to larger and more complex systems.

Broadband photo- and electroluminescence from silicon via momentum-expanded photonic states

Subjects:
Optics (physics.optics)
Silicon's indirect bandgap has long been seen as a limitation, fundamentally restricting its ability to emit light and hindering the development of silicon-based light sources. Here, we present a conceptually new solution to this persistent challenge. We demonstrate ultrabroadband photo- and electroluminescence from silicon, enabled by a novel radiative pathway mediated by momentum-expanded Heisenberg photonic states that bypass phonon-assisted transitions. This mechanism, previously demonstrated using metallic nanoparticles as photon confiners, is now realized in an all-silicon material using embedded sub-1.5 nm silicon nanoparticles to create confined photonic states. The results show excellent agreement with prior studies, confirming that the confinement size, rather than the specific confining material, is the main factor for activating radiative transitions in a momentum-forbidden system. Consistent with the photonic momentum expansion concept, both photo- and electro-driven emissions span the visible and near-infrared spectral ranges, with electroluminescence visible to the naked eye even under ambient daylight conditions. The simplicity and material-agnostic nature of this approach promise compatibility with standard fabrication processes, offering a practical and transformative route toward high-performance, all-silicon light-emitting diodes and laser sources. More generally, these findings reveal the emergence of a new hybrid light-matter regime, photonic Heisenberg matter, where extreme photon confinement directly reshapes the electronic transition landscape.

Phase retrieval in inline holography is a fundamental yet ill-posed inverse problem due to the nonlinear coupling between amplitude and phase in coherent imaging. We present a novel off-the-shelf solution that leverages a diffusion model trained solely on object amplitude to recover both amplitude and phase from diffraction intensities. Using a predictor-corrector sampling framework with separate likelihood gradients for amplitude and phase, our method enables complex field reconstruction without requiring ground-truth phase data for training. We validate the proposed approach through extensive simulations and experiments, demonstrating robust generalization across diverse object shapes, imaging system configurations, and modalities, including lensless setups. Notably, a diffusion prior trained on simple amplitude data (e.g., polystyrene beads) successfully reconstructs complex biological tissue structures, highlighting the method's adaptability. This framework provides a cost-effective, generalizable solution for nonlinear inverse problems in computational imaging, and establishes a foundation for broader coherent imaging applications beyond holography.

Grooves spacing govern water retention during condensation
Matteo Leonard, Nicolas Vandewalle
Subjects:
Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
Condensation on vertical surfaces leads to fluid retention, which limits the efficiency of applications ranging from heat exchangers to atmospheric water harvesters. A common strategy is to structure the surface with grooves, yet whether grooves help drainage or worsen retention remains unclear. Here we use a high-throughput condensation setup to quantify retention on substrates patterned with parallel vertical grooves of fixed geometry ($d/w=1$) while varying the spacing $s$. We uncover two opposite regimes separated by the droplet detachment radius $R_d$. For large spacings ($s>R_d$), droplets grow and slide under gravity while grooves, acting as passive reservoirs, increase retention. For small spacings ($s<R_d$), grooves instead trigger active drainage, confining droplet growth and reducing retention to values even lower than on smooth surfaces. Two asymptotic models, a groove-volume reservoir model and a plateau-packing model, capture this transition and explain the scaling of retention with $s$. These findings show that groove spacing controls whether grooves act as drains or reservoirs, providing a simple geometric design rule for tailoring condensation retention in practical systems.

Dynamic and Continuous Control of Second-Harmonic Chirality through Lithium Niobate Nonlocal Metasurface

Subjects:
Optics (physics.optics)
Nonlinear chiral light sources are crucial for emerging applications in chiroptics, including ultrafast spin dynamics and quantum state manipulation. However, achieving precise and dynamic control over nonlinear optical chirality with natural materials and metasurfaces, particularly those based on non-centrosymmetric materials such as lithium niobate (LN), is hindered by the complex tensorial nature of the second-order nonlinear susceptibility. Here, we demonstrate a nonlinear nonlocal metasurface, comprising plasmonic nanoantennas atop an x-cut LN thin film, that enables dynamic and continuous control of second-harmonic (SH) chirality. By leveraging two spectrally detuned resonances arising from the excitation of orthogonally propagating guided modes, enabled by lattice anisotropy and LN birefringence, we achieve full-range tuning of SH chirality, from right- to left-handed circular polarization, simply by rotating the polarization of a linearly polarized pump. The SH chirality, quantified by the Stokes parameter S3, is thereby continuously tuned from 0.991 to -0.993 in simulations and from 0.920 to -0.815 in experiments, while maintaining consistently enhanced SH intensity across the entire tuning range. Our approach opens new avenues for developing compact and tunable chiral sources, with potential applications in integrated nonlinear photonics and adaptable quantum technologies.

The exponential growth in satellite data traffic demands communication systems exceeding current microwave capacity limitations, while the terahertz (THz) frequency band (0.1-10 THz) offers unprecedented bandwidth potential with superior weather resilience compared to optical systems, particularly when combined with ultra-low Earth orbit (ULEO) satellite deployments below 300 km altitude. This article presents comprehensive channel modeling and performance evaluation for ULEO-THz satellite-to-ground communications, analyzing three distinct transmission architectures (direct satellite-to-ground, satellite-relay-ground forwarding, and satellite-to-high altitude base station with fiber backhaul) through altitude-resolved atmospheric propagation models validated using year-long meteorological data from four high-altitude stations in Tibet and Qinghai, China. The analysis incorporates frequency-dependent atmospheric absorption using ITU-R standards, free-space path loss with curved atmospheric modeling, and regional atmospheric variations to derive total channel path loss, available bandwidth capacity, and bit error rate (BER) performance under both AWGN and Weibull fading conditions across multiple THz frequencies. Results demonstrate that direct satellite-to-ground transmission at lower THz frequencies achieves optimal practical performance with maximum available bandwidth under QPSK modulation, while satellite-relay-ground forwarding suffers prohibitive cumulative losses from multiple hops, and satellite-to-high altitude base station configurations, despite favorable atmospheric channel characteristics, become impractical due to substantial electro-optical conversion penalties and fiber transmission losses in long-haul applications.

Experimental study of the acoustic frequency-up conversion effect by nonlinear thin plates

Classical methods of sound absorption present fundamental limits that can be overcome by using nonlinear effects. Thin clamped plates have been identified as strongly nonlinear elements, capable of transferring the acoustic power of an incident air-borne wave towards higher frequencies. Here, we experimentally show that these plates exhibit different vibrational nonlinear behaviors depending on the amplitude and frequency of the excitation signal. The lowest excitation levels achieved lead to harmonic generation in a weakly nonlinear regime, while higher levels produce quasi-periodic and chaotic regimes. Since these nonlinear vibration regimes govern the acoustic frequency-up conversion process, we investigate the influence of relevant physical and geometrical parameters on the emergence of these nonlinear regimes. A parametric study on plates of different thicknesses reveals that the frequency-up conversion effect is mostly guided by the resonance of the plate at its first eigenfrequency, which depends not only on its thickness but also on a static tension introduced by the clamping. Finally, a design proposition involving multiple plates with different properties is presented in order to reach a broadband frequency-up conversion.

Holey sheets: Double-Threshold Rupture of Draining Liquid Films

Subjects:
Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
Classical rupture is attributed to molecular (van der Waals) forces acting at nanometric thicknesses. Nonetheless, micron-thick liquid sheets routinely perforate far above the scale where these molecular forces act, yet the mechanism that selects opening versus healing has remained unclear. Using direct numerical simulations of a draining sheet with an entrained air bubble (cavity), we show that irreversible rupture occurs only when a deterministic double-threshold is crossed: (i) the outward driving (from airflow or inertia) is strong enough and (ii) the cavity is distorted enough. If either condition falls short, surface tension heals the cavity and the sheet reseals. The time for this process is set by the balance between inertia and viscosity -- fast for inertia-dominated sheets and slower for viscous ones. This double-threshold mechanism explains why micrometer-thick films perforate and offers practical control options -- driving strength and defect geometry -- for predicting and controlling breakup in spray formation processes, wave breaking, and respiratory films.

The Spin Physics Detector (SPD) experiment at the NICA collider in JINR aims to investigate the spin structure of nucleons and spin-related phenomena. The combination of the number of background processes, the event rate and conditions for event selection makes the use of a classical trigger system impractical, requiring a triggerless data acquisition (DAQ) system. The DAQ system is designed to ensure precise time synchronization, efficient data collection, and high-throughput processing. Its architecture combines commercially available FPGA-based modules and high-speed optical interfaces with custom-developed components based on widely accessible technologies. This approach provides scalability from 180,000 at the initial stage of the experiment to more than 600,000 detector channels in the final configuration and supports data rates up to 20 GB/s or more. The modular system design ensures adaptability for future upgrades while maintaining high efficiency and reliability. Such an approach makes the DAQ system suitable for other high-rate nuclear physics experiments.

Muon imaging, especially muon scattering tomography (MST), has recently garnered significant attention. MST measures the magnitude of muon scattering angles inside an object, which depends not only on the material properties but also on the muon momentum. Due to the difficulty of simultaneous measurement of momentum, it was neglected and taken as a constant in multiple MST reconstruction algorithms. Recently, an experimental measurement scheme has emerged that is feasible in engineering, but it requires many layers of detectors to approach the true momentum. From this, we proposed both an algorithm to incorporating momentum into MST, and a scheme to determine the thresholds of Cherenkov detectors. This novel scheme, termed the "equi-percentage scheme", sets momentum thresholds for Cherenkov detector layers based on cosmic muon momentum distribution. Results showed our approach delivers noticeable enhancement in reconstructed image quality even with only two detector layers, reaching near-saturation performance with four layers. This study proves that momentum measurement significantly enhances short-duration MST, and that substantial improvement can be achieved with relatively coarse momentum measurement using 2-4 layers of Cherenkov detectors.

Constraining Atmospheric River Uncertainty Using Instantaneous Poleward Latent Heat Transport

Subjects:
Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics (physics.ao-ph)
Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are extreme weather events that play a crucial role in the global hydrological cycle. As a key mechanism of latent heat transport (LHT), they help maintain energy balance in the climate system. While an AR is characterized by a long, narrow corridor of water vapor associated with a low-level jet stream, there is no unambiguous definition of an AR grounded in geophysical fluid dynamics. Therefore, AR identification is currently performed by a large array of expert-defined, threshold-based algorithms. The variety of algorithms introduces uncertainty in the estimated contribution of ARs to LHT. We calculate the instantaneous eddy LHT from moist, poleward anomalies. Based on the dynamics of the large-scale atmospheric circulation, this quantity is a physics-based upper bound that constrains AR projections from the variety of detection algorithms. We quantify the contribution of ARs to transient eddies, stationary eddies, and transient-stationary eddy interactions, and we show the relative contribution of ARs and other processes, such as dry, equatorward transport. We use this upper bound to quantify ARs' frequency, intensity, and temporal variability. In the historical climate, we find that ARs transport 2.21 PW at the latitude of peak meridional transport in Northern Hemisphere winter, with approximately 0.47 PW of temporal variability. By the end of the century in a future climate projection, at this latitude, we find that AR-induced LHT will increase by 0.5 PW and the corresponding temporal variability will increase by 0.14 PW.

We investigate the dynamical phase evolution of Coulomb-focused electrons in strong-field ionization. We diffract the electrons with an ultrashort standing light wave to track their time-dependent phase. Our findings show that low-energy electrons exhibit a unique chromosome-shaped diffraction pattern, distinct from higher-energy electrons. Our numerical model quantitatively reproduces the experimental results, confirming this pattern maps the electron's time-dependent phase evolution as it escapes from a Coulomb potential. Our pulsed diffraction grating technique offers a new way to sense an electron's quantum phase without interfering its release mechanism.

Molecular dynamics computer simulations have been conducted on neat liquid methanol, using three different united atom (three site) interatomic potentials: TraPPE [J. Phys. Chem. B 105, 3093 (2001)], UAM-I [J. Mol. Liq. 323, 114576 (2021)] and OPLS/2016 [J. Chem. Phys. 145, 034508 (2016)]. The effects of pressure, between 1 bar and 6 kbar, have been evaluated on total scattering structure factors, partial radial distribution functions, as well as on collective characteristics such as ring size distributions and cluster size distributions. Agreement with experimental density is nearly quantitative for all the three force fields, and major trends observed for recent pressure dependent neutron diffraction data are reproduced qualitatively. The OPLS/2016 force field, in general, generates properties that are markedly different from results originating from the other potentials. Pressure effects are hardly noticeable on most partial radial distribution functions and on the distribution of the number of hydrogen bonded neighbours. On the other hand, collective structural properties, like cluster- and ring size distributions exhibit significant changes with increasing pressure: larger clusters become more numerous, whereas the number of cyclic clusters, i.e., rings, decrease. The self-diffusion coefficient decreases with increasing pressure, and the same is valid for the average lifetime of hydrogen bonds.

A systematic comparison was carried out to assess the influence of representative thermostat methods in constant-temperature molecular dynamics simulations. The thermostat schemes considered include the Nosé--Hoover thermostat and its chain generalisation, the Bussi velocity rescaling method, and several implementations of the Langevin dynamics. Using a binary Lennard-Jones liquid as a model glass former, we investigated how the sampling of physical observables, such as particle velocities and potential energy, responds to changes in time step across these thermostats. While the Nosé--Hoover chain and Bussi thermostats provide reliable temperature control, a pronounced time-step dependence was observed in the potential energy. Amongst the Langevin methods, the Grønbech-Jensen--Farago scheme provided the most consistent sampling of both temperature and potential energy. Nonetheless, Langevin dynamics typically incurs approximately twice the computational cost due to the overhead of random number generation, and exhibits a systematic decrease in diffusion coefficients with increasing friction. This study presents a broad comparison of thermostat methods using a binary Lennard-Jones glass-former model, offering practical guidance for the choice of thermostats in classical molecular dynamics simulations. These findings provide useful insights for diverse applications, including glass transition, phase separation, and nucleation.

Advances in fluorescence microscopy have reached a plateau in improving depth-to-resolution ratios for imaging scattering tissues, highlighting an urgent need for innovative techniques. We introduce Wavelens, a groundbreaking opaque lens that combines dynamic wavefront shaping with a passive, angularly anisotropic photonic scattering plate-designed to scatter light predominantly in one direction. This compact, robust optoelectronic device, comparable in size to a conventional microscope lens, delivers superior light sheet formation capabilities. Using Wavelens, we achieved high-resolution LSFM imaging of diverse biological specimens, including 3D tumor spheroids and the intricate neural architecture of Caenorhabditis elegans in vivo. Notably, Wavelens maintains consistent light sheet properties even in dense, scattering-prone samples, overcoming a long-standing limitation of traditional microscopy. This innovative approach has the potential to revolutionize optical imaging, offering unprecedented clarity and resilience, even within dense, scattering-prone biological samples.

Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph)
Stochastic interacting particle systems are widely used to model collective phenomena across diverse fields, including statistical physics, biology, and social dynamics. The McKean-Vlasov equation arises as the mean-field limit of such systems as the number of particles tends to infinity, while its long-time behaviour is characterized by stationary distributions as time tends to infinity. However, the validity of interchanging the infinite-time and infinite-particle limits is not guaranteed. Consequently, simulation methods that rely on a finite-particle truncation may fail to accurately capture the mean-field system's stationary distributions, particularly when the coexistence of multiple metastable states leads to phase transitions. In this paper, we adapt the framework of the Weak Generative Sampler (WGS) -- a generative technique based on normalizing flows and a weak formulation of the nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation -- to compute and generate i.i.d. samples satisfying the stationary distributions of McKean-Vlasov processes. Extensive numerical experiments validate the efficacy of the proposed methods, showcasing their ability to accurately approximate stationary distributions and capture phase transitions in complex systems.

Observation of Fully Flat Bands in a Photonic Dipolar Kagome Lattice

Optics (physics.optics)
Flat bands, characterized by zero group velocity and strong energy localization, enable interaction-enhanced phenomena across both quantum and classical systems. Existing photonic flat-band implementations were limited to evanescent-wave systems, specific lattice symmetries, or complex supercell modulations. A simple, universal, and efficient approach to realizing flat bands without dedicated source excitation is to be explored. Here, inspired by geometrically frustrated configurations, we theoretically proposed and experimentally demonstrated threefold-degenerate flat bands by integrating orbital and rotational degrees of freedom in a photonic dipolar kagome lattice. By rotating the dipole orientation, the system exhibits a band flip transition at which point all bands achieve complete flatness and degeneracy across the entire Brillouin zone. In contrast to conventional s-orbital kagome lattices with only a single flat band, our approach flattens the entire band structure, eliminating dispersive modes and enabling compatibility with arbitrary excitations. These results establish a new mechanism for flat-band engineering, offering a tunable strategy for enhancing light-matter interactions and may have applications in compact photonic devices and energy-efficient information processing.

Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
Vertical equilibrium (VE) models have been introduced as computationally efficient alternatives to traditional mass and momentum balance equations for fluid flow in porous media. Since VE models are only accurate in regions where phase equilibrium holds, while traditional simulations are computationally demanding, hybrid methods have been proposed to combine the accuracy of the full-dimensional approach with the efficiency of VE model. However, coupling both models introduces computational overhead that can make hybrid simulations slower than fully traditional ones. To address this, we introduce data-driven surrogates to predict the gas plume distance and coarse-level mobilities in the VE model, as well as predictors to accelerate the coupling scheme. We focus on surrogate models with short inference times to minimize computational overhead during frequent function calls. The proposed approach preserves key physical properties, such as mass conservation, while substantially reducing simulation runtimes. Overall, combining data-driven methods with the hybrid VE scheme yields an enhanced model that outperforms traditional simulations in speed while introducing only negligible errors.

High-harmonic spectroscopy (HHS) in liquids promises real-time access to ultrafast electronic dynamics in the native environment of chemical and biological processes. While electron recollision has been established as the dominant mechanism of high-harmonic generation (HHG) in liquids, resolving the underlying electron dynamics has remained elusive. Here we demonstrate attosecond-resolved measurements of recolliding electron wave packets, extending HHS from neat liquids to aqueous solutions. Using phase-controlled two-colour fields, we observe a linear scaling of the two-colour delay that maximizes even-harmonic emission with photon energy, yielding slopes of 208+/-55 as/eV in ethanol and 124+/-42 as/eV in water, the latter matching ab initio simulations (125+/-48 as/eV). In aqueous salt solutions, we uncover interference minima whose appearance depends on solute type and concentration, arising from destructive interference between solute and solvent emission. By measuring the relative phase of solvent and solute HHG, we retrieve a variation of electron transit time by 113+/-32 as/eV, consistent with our neat-liquid results. These findings establish HHS as a powerful attosecond-resolved probe of electron dynamics in disordered media, opening transformative opportunities for studying ultrafast processes such as energy transfer, charge migration, and proton dynamics in liquids and solutions.

Generalization of the viscous stress tensor to the case of non-small gradients of hydrodynamic velocity: a path to numerical modeling of turbulence non-locality

Generalization of the Chapman-Enskog method to the case of large gradients of hydrodynamic velocity allowed us to obtain an integral (over spatial coordinates) representation of the viscous stress tensor in the Navier-Stokes equation. In the case of small path lengths of the medium disturbance, the tensor goes over to the standard form, which, as is known, is difficult to apply to the description of tangential discontinuities and separated flows. The obtained expression can allow numerical modeling of the nonlocality of turbulence, expressed by the empirical Richardson t^3 law for pair correlations in a turbulent medium.

Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph); Optics (physics.optics)
We present a method for determining the azimuthal phase (angle) of a magnetic field by exploiting phase matching of laser beams in a ground-state Hanle effect (GHSE) configuration. This approach is based on the symmetry of the system's Hamiltonian and the existence of a phase-independent frame, allowing for direct determination of the field orientation. As a proof of concept, we performed preliminary experiments using the Fg=1 to Fe=0 transition of the D2 line in 87Rb, with three laser beams to demonstrate the phase (azimuthal) dependence of the observed Hanle resonance signals. While our current setup does not include active phase control, the key features predicted by our method were observed, validating its conceptual foundation. Additionally, we measured two components of the stray magnetic field in our laboratory as an illustration. This method leverages the Hanle effect's inherent sensitivity to both the magnitude and orientation of magnetic fields, as well as the underlying symmetry properties of the atomic system, and offers a pathway for precise, calibration-free determination of magnetic field orientation.

As electronic computing approaches its performance limits, photonic accelerators have emerged as promising alternatives. Photonic accelerators exploiting semiconductor-laser synchronization have been studied for decision-making. While conventional cross-correlation methods are computationally intensive and memory demanding, we propose a frequency-based approach using optical frequency differences. Simulations and experiments confirm that this method achieves decision making with reduced cost and memory requirements.

In magnetically confined fusion device, the complex, multiscale, and nonlinear dynamics of plasmas necessitate the integration of extensive diagnostic systems to effectively monitor and control plasma behaviour. The complexity and uncertainty arising from these extensive systems and their tangled interrelations has long posed a significant obstacle to the acceleration of fusion energy development. In this work, a large-scale model, fusion masked auto-encoder (FusionMAE) is pre-trained to compress the information from 88 diagnostic signals into a concrete embedding, to provide a unified interface between diagnostic systems and control actuators. Two mechanisms are proposed to ensure a meaningful embedding: compression-reduction and missing-signal reconstruction. Upon completion of pre-training, the model acquires the capability for 'virtual backup diagnosis', enabling the inference of missing diagnostic data with 96.7% reliability. Furthermore, the model demonstrates three emergent capabilities: automatic data analysis, universal control-diagnosis interface, and enhancement of control performance on multiple tasks. This work pioneers large-scale AI model integration in fusion energy, demonstrating how pre-trained embeddings can simplify the system interface, reducing necessary diagnostic systems and optimize operation performance for future fusion reactors.

Optics (physics.optics)
Optical analog computing enables powerful functionalities, including spatial differentiation, image processing, and ultrafast linear operations. Yet, most existing approaches rely on resonant or periodic structures, whose performance is strongly wavelength-dependent, imposing bandwidth limitations and demanding stringent fabrication tolerances. Here, to address some of these challenges, we introduce a highly tunable platform for optical processing, composed of two cascaded uniform slabs exhibiting both circular and linear birefringence, whose response exhibits features relevant to optical processing without relying on resonances. Specifically, using a coupled-wave theory framework we show that sharp reflection minima, referred to as spectral holes, emerge from destructive interference between counter-propagating circularly polarized waves in uniform birefringent slabs, and can be engineered solely through parameter tuning without requiring any spatial periodicity. Unlike traditional Bragg scattering, this mechanism operates without a resonance condition and enables a comparatively broader spectral response through material parameter tuning in spatially uniform media. When operated in the negative refraction regime enabled by giant chirality, the proposed system acts as a polarization-selective Laplacian-like operator, whose functionality is evidenced by an edge-detection proof of concept. The required material parameters align closely with recent experimental demonstrations of giant, tunable chirality via meta-optics, presenting a promising pathway towards compact and reconfigurable platforms for all-optical pattern recognition and image restoration.

Extreme vertical drafts as drivers of Lagrangian dispersion in stably stratified turbulent flows

Subjects:

The dispersion of Lagrangian particle pairs is a fundamental process in turbulence, with implications for mixing, transport, and the statistical properties of particles in geophysical and environmental flows. While classical theories describe pair dispersion through scaling laws related to energy cascades, extreme events in turbulent flows can significantly alter these dynamics. This is especially important in stratified flows, where intermittency manifests itself also as strong updrafts and downdrafts. In this study, we investigate the influence of extreme events on the relative dispersion of particle pairs in stably stratified turbulence. Using numerical simulations we analyze the statistical properties of pair separation across different regimes, and quantify deviations from classical Richardson scaling. Our results highlight the role of extreme drafts in accelerating dispersion. These findings have important implications for turbulent mixing in natural systems, including atmospheric and oceanic flows, as well as applications in cloud microphysics and pollutant transport.

Anisoplanatic errors in two-wavelength adaptive optics

Subjects:
Optics (physics.optics)
Two-wavelength adaptive optics (AO) systems sense wavefront errors using a beacon at one wavelength, while correcting for subsequent imaging or beam projection at another. Although most AO systems operate in this manner, the relevant AO literature is generally concerned with quantifying system performance at a single wavelength, effectively ignoring the two-wavelength nature of the problem. In this paper, we study the effects of anisoplanatism, or the physical separation of the beacon and transmit light, on two-wavelength AO systems for imaging and beam projection applications. We derive the piston-removed (PR) and piston-and-tilt-removed (PTR) optical-path-difference (OPD) variances including anisoplanatism, which are key metrics of AO system performance. We compare our closed-form PR and PTR OPD variances to numerical results and discuss their physical significance. In addition, we introduce the two-wavelength isoplanatic angle and show how it can be used to quickly assess two-wavelength AO system performance. At large, the analysis contained in this paper will inform the design and implementation of two-wavelength AO systems for multiple imaging and beam projection applications.

We compare two methods for evaluating cardinality of the Cartesian product $N \times N$ of the set of natural numbers $N$. The first is used to explain the thermodynamics of black body radiation by using convergent functions on $N \times N$. Cardinality of $N \times N$ enters through the partition function that acts as the normalization constant of a probability distribution over $N \times N$. Here, $N \times N$ is given a greater cardinality than $N$. The expression of the partition function and, hence, the cardinality of $N \times N$ can be verified experimentally by using the internal energy and quantum entropy. The second method is used in analysis and topology to count the rational numbers by using divergent functions on $N \times N$. Here, $N \times N$ is not given a greater cardinality than that of $N$. In this article, we will show that the experimentally confirmed first approach is mathematically more consistent, provides an actual act of counting to find the cardinality of $N \times N$ and gives a quantitative measure of the cardinality of $N \times N$ relative to that of $N$. Similar arguments will show that the set of rational numbers is not countable. This article indicates that the \textit{axiom of choice} could be a better technique to prove theorems that require second-countability.

Density-based topology optimization strategy for optimal design of uniform flow manifolds

Subjects:
Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
Uniform flow distribution across parallel channels directly impacts the performance and efficiency of many fluid and energy systems. However, designing efficient flow manifolds that ensure uniform flow distribution remains a challenge. This issue is even more pronounced in the design of multichannel three-dimensional manifolds. Hence, this study presents a scalable topology optimization framework for the systematic design of multi-channel flow manifolds. The proposed method extends the conventional density-based topology optimization formulation by introducing a flow maldistribution coefficient as an explicit constraint. This novel approach was implemented using the incompressible Navier-Stokes flow solver available in the open-source CFD suite SU2. The performance of the proposed method was benchmarked against two established topology optimization strategies using an exemplary planar z-type flow manifold, wherein both the inlet and outlet manifoldswere designed simultaneously. The results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves flow uniformity comparable to that obtained by established approaches while significantly reducing the associated computational cost. Furthermore, when applied to large-scale three-dimensional problems, the proposed method produces feasible designs that achieve uniform flow distribution and exhibit innovative geometrical features. Thus advocating for the robustness and scalability of the proposed method.

Unlocking the full potential of integrated photonics requires versatile, multi-functional devices that can adapt to diverse application demands. However, confronting this challenge with conventional single-function resonators often results in tedious and complex systems. We present an elegant solution: a versatile and reconfigurable dual-polarization Si3N4 microresonator that represents a paradigm shift in on-chip photonic designs. Our device, based on a binary-star orbital architecture, can be dynamically reconfigured into three distinct topologies: a Möbius-like microcavity, a Fabry-Pérot resonator, and a microring resonator. This unprecedented functionality is enabled by a tunable balanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer that facilitates controllable mutual mode coupling of counterpropagating lights using a single control knob. We experimentally demonstrate that the device not only supports polarization-diverse operation on a compact footprint but also gives rise to a rich variety of physical phenomena, including a standing wave cavity, a traveling wave cavity, free spectral range multiplication, and the photonic pinning effect. These behaviors are accurately modeled using the Transfer Matrix Method and intuitively explained by Temporal Coupled Mode Theory. Our results underscore the profound potential for a chip-scale platform to realize reconfigurable reconstructive spectrometers and on-chip synthetic dimensions for topological physics.

Online Dose Verification in VHEE Radiotherapy Using Bremsstrahlung Radiation

Subjects:
Medical Physics (physics.med-ph)
Very high energy electrons (VHEE) in the 50-250 MeV range, delivered in short pulses at ultra-high dose rates, are proposed for clinical FLASH radiotherapy (RT) targeting deep-seated tumors. The clinical implementation of VHEE-FLASH RT requires online verification to optimize dose delivery. In this study we propose a novel online dose verification technique based on the detection of bremsstrahlung photons during VHEE interactions with matter. A polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) phantom was simulated to evaluate the dose deposited by a VHEE beam and to optimise the system design to detect the bremsstralung radiation. Experimental validation was performed at the Beam Test Facility at Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati (Isituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare-INFN). A deep learning pipeline was developed to reconstruct the dose distribution in the phantom based on the bremsstrahlung radiation profile. Experimental results demonstrated successful detection of bremsstrahlung radiation emitted orthogonally to the beam axis. The deep learning model achieved accurate dose reconstruction based on the bremsstrahlung radiation profile with a discrepancy of less than 2 percent compared to the simulated dose distribution. This study confirms that bremsstrahlung detection provides a viable online verification for VHEE RT.

We demonstrate that narrowband multi-cycle terahertz (MC-THz) sources based on periodically-poled lithium niobate (PPLN) wafer stacks can be driven by high repetition-rate, high energy femtosecond ytterbium-doped lasers. Operating at 10-kHz repetition rate with up to 104 W of pump power on a 10-wafer stack, we measure 26.4 mW of THz average power for a narrowband multi-cycle source. We identify and quantify strong lensing effects causing dramatic beam focusing in 47 wafer stacks which act as a primary limitation in the current configuration, and present mitigation strategies for future scaling. This first study of high average power narrowband multi-cycle THz sources offers a path forward to Watt-level high repetition rate sources using thin lithium niobate plates.

Optics (physics.optics)
Modern high-definition display and augmented reality technologies require the development of ultracompact micro- and nano-pixels with colors covering the full gamut and high brightness. In this regard, lasing nano-pixels emitting light in the spectral range 400-700 nm are highly demanded. Despite progress in red, green, and ultraviolet nanolasers, the demonstrated blue-range (400-500 nm) single-particle-based lasers are still not subwavelength yet. Here we fabricate CsPbCl$_3$ cubic-shaped single-crystal nanolasers on a silver substrate by wet chemistry synthesis, producing their size range around 100-500 nm, where the nanoparticle with sizes 0.145$\mu$m$\times$0.195$\mu$m$\times$0.19$\mu$m and volume 0.005 $\mu$m$^3$ (i.e. $\sim\lambda^3$/13) is the smallest nanolaser among the lasers operating in the blue range reported so far, with emission wavelength around $\lambda\approx 415$ nm. Experimental results at a temperature of 80 K and theoretical modeling show that the CsPbCl$_3$ nanolaser is a polaritonic laser where exciton-polaritons are strongly coupled with Mie resonances enhanced by the metallic substrate. As a result, the combination of the strong excitonic response of CsPbCl$_3$ materials, its high crystalline quality, and optimized optical resonant properties resulting in a population-inversion-free lasing regime are the key factors making the proposed nanolaser design superior among previously reported ones in the blue spectral range.

This study presents a systematic characterization of burner-stabilized lean hydrogen flame morphology across a wide range of equivalence ratios, dilution factors, and flow rates. Spatially resolved measurements of three-dimensional temperature and OH distributions were achieved. A comprehensive dataset of over 200 flame cases was obtained, enabling accurate determination of regime diagrams for different flame modes. Linear stability analysis and direct numerical simulations were also performed and compared with the experimental results. The dominant wavenumbers of steady-state cellular flames were found to be consistently lower than the most unstable wavenumbers predicted by the linearized dispersion relation, indicating that nonlinear interactions between finite-amplitude perturbations of different length scales favored the growth of low-frequency components at long times. The cellular structures were found to be critically important in stabilizing the flame, especially at nominal equivalence ratios near the lean flammability limit. The mechanism of cellular flame stabilization was analyzed by complementary numerical simulations using a detailed reaction model. The combined effect of curvature-induced flame acceleration, local flow expansion/compression near the burner surface, and stratification of equivalence ratio caused by Soret diffusion created regions of reduced flow speed and enriched hydrogen concentration that helped anchor flames at nominal conditions where they would have blown off without the flame cells. The results of the present study are useful for understanding the fundamental flame dynamics of lean hydrogen mixtures and for improving the design of practical hydrogen combustors.

Photovoltaic conversion is highly dependent on the converter's temperature. In the absence of atmosphere, it can be rigorously determined using a thermal balance leading to a compact expression. The derivation starts from a fully spectral, two-sided radiative balance and proceeds to a practical gray-band (integrated) expression that can be used to estimate Tc from measurable quantities: plane-of-array irradiance, spectral absorptance (or a broadband absorptance), thermal emissivities, view factors to the regolith and to space, module electrical efficiency, and conduction to the mount. The model can be extended to other airless celestial bodies and to deep space.

Quantifying CO2 Distribution at the Air-Water Interface - Spatiotemporally Resolved Measurements Using Tunable Diode Laser Spectroscopy

Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
The transport of CO2 across the air-water interface plays a critical role in physical oceanography and carbon sequestration. One of the key challenges in understanding such transport processes is their multiscale nature - the spatial and temporal scales of gas- and liquid-phase diffusion, absorption and reaction span over several orders of magnitude, which requires high-resolution diagnostic methods to unravel their detailed dynamics. The current study presents a novel diagnostic method to quantify the CO2 distribution at the air-water interface in a spatially and temporally resolved manner. This method combines the advantages of tunable diode laser spectroscopy and rapid spatial beam scanning for precision measurement of the CO2 concentration profile above the interface. The performance of this method was examined in a series of quasi-1D demonstration experiments conducted in a custom-built miniature gas chamber, where the cross-interface diffusion and absorption of gas-phase CO2 into pure water and alkaline solutions of different pH values were continuously monitored. An effective time resolution of 5 ms and an effective spatial resolution of 1 mm were achieved. The results of the gas-phase CO2 distribution evolution agreed well with the classic one-dimensional diffusion model, which verified the accuracy of the current method. Additionally, an interesting phenomenon was observed regarding the temporal evolution of interfacial CO2 concentration at different pH levels: its depletion rate exhibited strong pH sensitivity at relatively low pH but saturated near pH = 10. This could be attributed to competition between gas-/liquid-phase diffusion and absorption/reaction occurring within the interface layer. The high temporal and spatial resolution of the current method promises to be useful in experimental studies of cross-interface gas transport under more complex flow conditions as well.

Multidimensional up-down deconvolution effectively eliminates surface-related multiples from ocean-bottom seismic data. Recently, several down-down deconvolution methods have been introduced as attractive alternatives. Whereas multidimensional up-down deconvolution fully accounts for lateral variations of the medium parameters, the underlying theory of some of the down-down deconvolution methods is essentially based on the assumption that the medium is horizontally layered. We derive representations for multidimensional down-down deconvolution for laterally varying media in a uniform manner and discuss the pros and cons of the various methods.

We introduce a hybrid approach for computing dynamical observables in strongly correlated systems using higher-order moments. This method integrates memory kernel coupling theory (MKCT) with the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), extending our recent work on MKCT to strongly correlated systems. The method establishes that correlation functions can be derived from the moments. Within our framework, operators and wavefunctions are represented as matrix product operators (MPOs) and matrix product states (MPSs), respectively. Crucially, the repeated application of the Liouville operator is achieved through an iterative procedure analogous to the DMRG algorithm itself. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of MKCT-DMRG by computing the spectral function of the Hubbard model. Furthermore, we successfully apply the method to compute the electronic friction in the Hubbard-Holstein model. In all cases, the results show excellent agreement with time-dependent DMRG (TD-DMRG) benchmarks. The advantage of MKCT-DMRG over TD-DMRG is the computational efficiency, which avoids expensive real-time propagation in TD-DMRG. These findings establish MKCT-DMRG as a promising and accurate framework for simulating challenging dynamical properties in strongly correlated quantum systems.

Subjects:
Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph)
Dimensional analysis is fundamental to the formulation and validation of physical laws, ensuring that equations are dimensionally homogeneous and scientifically meaningful. In this work, we use Lean 4 to formalize the mathematics of dimensional analysis. We define physical dimensions as mappings from base dimensions to exponents, prove that they form an Abelian group under multiplication, and implement derived dimensions and dimensional homogeneity theorems. Building on this foundation, we introduce a definition of physical variables that combines numeric values with dimensions, extend the framework to incorporate SI base units and fundamental constants, and implement the Buckingham Pi Theorem. Finally, we demonstrate the approach on an example: the Lennard-Jones potential, where our framework enforces dimensional consistency and enables formal proofs of physical properties such as zero-energy separation and the force law. This work establishes a reusable, formally verified framework for dimensional analysis in Lean, providing a foundation for future libraries in formalized science and a pathway toward scientific computing environments with built-in guarantees of dimensional correctness.

Space Physics (physics.space-ph); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM)
Space radiation is one of the major obstacles to space exploration. If not mitigated, radiation can interact both with biological and electronic systems, inducing damage and posing significant risk to space missions. Countermeasures can only be studied effectively with ground-based accelerators that act as a proxy for space radiation, typically with a harsher radiation field that worsen the effects of space radiation. Following an in-silico design and optimization process we have developed a galactic cosmic ray (GCR) simulator using a hybrid active-passive methodology. In this approach, the primary beam energy is actively switched and the beam interacts with specifically designed passive modulators. In this paper, we present the implementation of such a GCR simulator and its experimental microdosimetric characterization. Measuring the GCR field is of paramount importance, both before providing it to the user as a validated radiation field and for achieving the best possible radiation description. The issue is addressed in this paper by using a tissue-equivalent proportional counter to measure radiation quality and by comparing experimental measurements with Monte Carlo simulations. In conclusion, we will demonstrate the GCR simulator's capability to reproduce a GCR field.

High-energy heavy-ion particle accelerators have long served as a proxy for the harsh space radiation environment, enabling both fundamental life-science research and applied testing of flight components. Typically, monoenergetic high-energy heavy-ion beams are used to mimic the complex mixed radiation field encountered in low Earth orbit and beyond. However, synergistic effects arising from the spatial or temporal proximity of interactions of different radiation qualities in a mixed field cannot be fully assessed with such beams. Therefore, spearheaded by developments at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory, the GSI Helmholtzzentrum fuer Schwerionenforschung, supported by ESA, has developed advanced space radiation simulation capabilities to support space radiation studies in Europe. Here, we report the design, optimization, and in-silico benchmarking of GSI's hybrid active-passive GCR simulator. Additionally, a computationally optimized phase-space particle source for Geant4 is presented, which will be made available to external users to support their own in-silico studies and experimental planning.

Photons, unlike electrons, do not couple directly to magnetic fields, yet synthetic gauge fields can impart magnetic-like responses and enable topological transport. Discretized Floquet evolution provides a controlled route, where the time-ordered sequencing of non-commuting Hamiltonians imprints complex hopping phases and breaks time-reversal symmetry. However, stabilizing such driven dynamics and observing unambiguous topological signatures on a reconfigurable platform has remained challenging. Here we demonstrate synthetic gauge fields for light on a programmable photonic processor by implementing discretized Floquet drives that combine static and dynamic phases. This approach reveals hallmark features of topological transport: chiral circulation that reverses under drive inversion, flux-controlled interference with high visibility, and robust directional flow stabilized by maximizing the minimal Floquet quasi-energy gap. The dynamics are further characterized by a first-harmonic phase order parameter, whose per-period winding number quantifies angular drift and reverses sign with the drive order. These results establish discretized, gap-optimized Floquet evolution as a versatile and fully programmable framework for topological photonics, providing a compact route to engineer gauge fields, stabilize driven phases, and probe winding-number signatures of chiral transport.

In an increased automated world, miniaturization is the key to widespread deployment of advanced technologies. Enhancing the torque transmissibility by abiding to the spatial constraints imposed by radial space availability has consistently remained a hurdle in the implementation of Magneto-Rheological (MR) clutches that use shear mode of MR fluid (MRF). This proves the necessity of a novel design capable of providing required transmission capability with a reduced transmission surface area. The present study analyzes a corrugated transmissible surface design which improves torque transmissibility with the help of increased transmission area and proper alignment of field lines passing through the MRF gap. In this paper, the impact of various dimensional parameters of a hybrid corrugated plane type MR clutch (MRC) design was studied with the aid of magnetic analysis performed on COMSOL Multiphysics software. The results obtained shows that various parameters in the design of MR clutches, such as annular and radial MR gaps, disc width, individual corrugation heights, corrugation width, bobbin thickness and radii of plane surface influences the torque transmission capability of MR clutches. Also, an optimization of the hybrid corrugated plane MR Clutch of the chosen geometry has been conducted with the transmission capability increasing by 39.37% compared with the non-optimized geometrical configuration.

We develop the Kazantsev theory of small-scale dynamo generation at small Prandtl numbers near the generation threshold and restore the concordance between the theory and numerical simulations: the theory predicted a power-law decay below the threshold, while simulations demonstrate exponential decay. We show that the exponential decay is temporary and owes its existence to the flattening of the velocity correlator at large scales. This effect corresponds to the existence of a long-living virtual level in the corresponding Schrodinger type equation. We also find the critical Reynolds number and the increment of growth/decay above and under the threshold; we express them in terms of the quantitative characteristic properties of the velocity correlator, which makes it possible to compare the results with the data of different simulations.

Numerical Investigations of Jet A Hexane Binary Fuel Droplet Impact on a Heated Solid Surface

Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
In the present work, Jet A-Hexane binary fuel droplet impact dynamics on heated solid surfaces were studied numerically. This study is crucial for practical applications such as fuel injection in combustors and thermal management of engine components. Volume of fluid (VOF) method was used to analyse the impact dynamics, spreading behaviour, vaporisation, and heat transfer of n-hexane and Jet-A blended fuel droplets on heated stainless-steel surfaces. Droplet impact dynamics were investigated for two Weber numbers, i.e., 25 and 50, and surface temperatures ranging from 50C to 227C to capture transitions from gentle spreading to nucleate boiling and rebound phenomena. This work examines how fuel blending influences inertia, lamella formation, vapour recoil, and film boiling regimes. The results show that higher inertia in blended fuels enhances spreading but also triggers stronger vapour recoil at elevated temperatures, leading to droplet rebound. In contrast, pure hexane transitions to a stable film boiling regime at high surface temperatures, resulting in a decline in smoother heat flux. New correlations were developed linking Weber number, spreading ratio, and wall heat flux, offering predictive insights for real-world combustion scenarios. These findings advance the understanding of bi-component fuel droplet impacts on heated surfaces and provide a framework for designing efficient spray systems in combustors and thermal management in propulsion and power generation applications.

Runaway electron interactions with whistler waves in tokamak plasmas: energy-dependent transport scaling

Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph)
Resonant interactions between high energy runaway electrons (REs) and whistler waves are a promising mechanism for RE mitigation in tokamak plasmas. While prior studies have largely relied on quasi-linear diffusion models in simplified geometries, we present a first-principles-informed framework that models RE-whistler interactions in a 3D tokamak equilibrium. This is achieved by coupling AORSA, which computes whistler eigenmodes for a given tokamak plasma equilibrium, and KORC, a kinetic orbit code that tracks full orbit RE trajectories in prescribed wave fields. Our results demonstrate that REs undergo scattering to large pitch angles and exhibit anomalous diffusion in both pitch-angle and kinetic energy space. Crucially, we observe a transition between diffusive, sub-diffusive, and super-diffusive transport regimes as a function of initial RE energy - an effect not captured by existing quasi-linear models. This anomalous transport behavior represents a significant advancement in understanding RE dynamics in the presence of wave - particle interactions. By identifying the conditions under which anomalous diffusion arises, this work lays the theoretical foundation for designing targeted, wave-based mitigation strategies in future tokamak experiments.

Dinoflagellates are marine phytoplankton that emit flashes of light in response to flow-induced deformation; they are responsible for illuminating breaking-waves, wakes of ships, and other intensely turbulent spots of the upper ocean. Here, we ask how bioluminescence is affected by the fluctuating nature of turbulence -- a question motivated by the dependence of emitted flashes on both the extent and rate of deformation. Introducing a light-emitting dumbbell as a minimal model, we study the Lagrangian dynamics of flashing in a homogeneous isotropic turbulent flow, and contrast it with that in an extensional flow and a Gaussian random flow. We show that turbulent fluctuations strongly enhance bioluminescence, while introducing a Poisson-like stochasticity in the flashing dynamics. Furthermore, the intermittent fluctuations of the velocity-gradient subjects the dinoflagellate to bursts of extreme straining and produces bright flashes -- more intense, though less frequent, than what would result from Gaussian fluctuations. Our results suggest that radiant displays of marine bioluminescence are strongly promoted by turbulence and its dissipation-scale intermittency.

The May 2024 geomagnetic superstorm provided the opportunity to explore how strong wave-particle interactions affect energetic electron precipitation under intense driving. Using coordinated measurements from a balloon-borne Timepix-based X-ray detector, ground-based riometers and magnetometers, and Arase satellite observations, we identified quasi-periodic bursts of energetic electron precipitation coincident with Pc5 ultra low frequency (ULF) wave oscillations. Arase satellite data revealed energy-dispersed trapped energetic electron flux modulations in the 'seed' energy range, indicating that trapped electron flux was likely modulated by ULF waves. This letter reveals that these flux enhancements surpassed the Kennel-Petschek (K-P) limit, creating intense chorus waves and driving periodic electron precipitation. Drift-dispersion analysis traced these modulations back to a source in the post-noon magnetospheric sector, matching balloon and ground-based measurements. Here, we propose a novel indirect ULF wave-driven mechanism for modulated energetic electron precipitation, whereby periodic modulations of `seed' electron fluxes enhance electron losses.

In natural ecosystems and human societies, self-organized resource allocation and policy synergy are ubiquitous and significant. This work focuses on the synergy between Dual Reinforcement Learning Policies in the Minority Game (DRLP-MG) to optimize resource allocation. Our study examines a mixed-structured population with two sub-populations: a Q-subpopulation using Q-learning policy and a C-subpopulation adopting the classical policy. We first identify a synergy effect between these subpopulations. A first-order phase transition occurs as the mixing ratio of the subpopulations changes. Further analysis reveals that the Q-subpopulation consists of two internal synergy clusters (IS-clusters) and a single external synergy cluster (ES-cluster). The former contribute to the internal synergy within the Q-subpopulation through synchronization and anti-synchronization, whereas the latter engages in the inter-subpopulation synergy. Within the ES-cluster, the classical momentum strategy in the financial market manifests and assumes a crucial role in the inter-subpopulation synergy. This particular strategy serves to prevent long-term under-utilization of resources. However, it also triggers trend reversals and leads to a decrease in rewards for those who adopt it. Our research reveals that the frozen effect, in either the C- or Q-subpopulation, is a crucial prerequisite for synergy, consistent with previous studies. We also conduct mathematical analyses on subpopulation synergy effects and the synchronization and anti-synchronization forms of IS-clusters in the Q-subpopulation. Overall, our work comprehensively explores the complex resource-allocation dynamics in DRLP-MG, uncovers multiple synergy mechanisms and their conditions, enriching the theoretical understanding of reinforcement-learning-based resource allocation and offering valuable practical insights

Landau levels (LLs) are the massively-degenerate discrete energy spectrum of a charged particle in a transverse magnetic field and lie at the heart of many intriguing phenomena such as the integer and fractional quantum Hall effects as well as quantized vortices. In this Letter, we consider coupling of LLs of a transversely driven charge neutral particle in a synthetic gauge potential to a quantized field of an optical cavity -- a setting reminiscent of superradiant self-ordering setups in quantum gases. We uncover that this complex system can be surprisingly described in terms of two highly nonlinearly-coupled quantum harmonic oscillators, thus enabling a full quantum mechanical treatment. Light-matter coupling mixes the LLs and the superradiant photonic mode, leading to the formation of hybrid states referred to as ``Landau polaritons''. They inherit partially the degeneracy of the LLs and possess intriguing features such as non-zero light-matter entanglement and quadrature squeezing. Depending on the system parameters and the choice of initial state, the system exhibits diverse nonequilibrium quantum dynamics and multiple steady states, with distinct physical properties. This work lays the foundation for further investigating the novel, driven-dissipative Landau-polariton physics in quantum-gas--cavity-QED settings.

We present a neural network wavefunction framework for solving non-Abelian lattice gauge theories in a continuous group representation. Using a combination of $SU(2)$ equivariant neural networks alongside an $SU(2)$ invariant, physics-inspired ansatz, we learn a parameterization of the ground state wavefunction of $SU(2)$ lattice gauge theory in 2+1 and 3+1 dimensions. Our method, performed in the Hamiltonian formulation, has a straightforward generalization to $SU(N)$. We benchmark our approach against a solely invariant ansatz by computing the ground state energy, demonstrating the need for bespoke gauge equivariant transformations. We evaluate the Creutz ratio and average Wilson loop, and obtain results in strong agreement with perturbative expansions. Our method opens up an avenue for studying lattice gauge theories beyond one dimension, with efficient scaling to larger systems, and in a way that avoids both the sign problem and any discretization of the gauge group.

Near-Earth asteroid 2024 YR4 was discovered on 2024-12-27 and its probability of Earth impact in December 2032 peaked at about 3% on 2025-02-18. Additional observations ruled out Earth impact by 2025-02-23. However, the probability of lunar impact in December 2032 then rose, reaching about 4% by the end of the apparition in May 2025. James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations on 2025-03-26 estimated the asteroid's diameter at 60 +/- 7 m. Studies of 2024 YR4's potential lunar impact effects suggest lunar ejecta could increase micrometeoroid debris flux in low Earth orbit up to 1000 times above background levels over just a few days, possibly threatening astronauts and spacecraft. In this work, we present options for space missions to 2024 YR4 that could be utilized if lunar impact is confirmed. We cover flyby & rendezvous reconnaissance, deflection, and robust disruption of the asteroid. We examine both rapid-response and delayed launch options through 2032. We evaluate chemical and solar electric propulsion, various launch vehicles, optimized deep space maneuvers, and gravity assists. Re-tasking extant spacecraft and using built spacecraft not yet launched are also considered. The best reconnaissance mission options launch in late 2028, leaving only approximately three years for development at the time of this writing in August 2025. Deflection missions were assessed and appear impractical. However, kinetic robust disruption missions are available with launches between April 2030 and April 2032. Nuclear robust disruption missions are also available with launches between late 2029 and late 2031. Finally, even if lunar impact is ruled out there is significant potential utility in deploying a reconnaissance mission to characterize the asteroid.

Spectral Analysis of Light Interstitial Segregation Energies in Ni: The Role of Local Cr Coordination for Boron and Carbon

Understanding interstitial segregation in chemically complex alloys requires accounting for chemical and structural heterogeneity of interfaces, motivating approaches that move beyond scalar descriptors to capture the full spatial and compositional spectra of segregation behavior. Here, we introduce a spectral segregation framework that maps distributions of segregation energies for light interstitials in Ni as a function of local Cr coordination. Boron exhibits a broad, rugged energy spectrum with significant positional flexibility whereas carbon remains confined to a narrow spectrum with minimal displacement. At the free surface, Cr-rich coordination destabilizes both interstitials (e.g., positive segregation energies), in sharp contrast to the stabilizing role of Cr at the GB. This inversion establishes a natural segregation gradient that drives interstitials away from undercoordinated internal surfaces and toward GBs. These results underscore the limitations of single-valued segregation descriptors and demonstrate how a distributional approach reveals the mechanistic origins of interstitial--interface interactions in chemically heterogeneous alloys.

Scattering theory for Stokes flow in complex branched structures

Slow, viscous flow in branched structures arises in many biological and engineering settings. Direct numerical simulation of flow in such complicated multi-scale geometry, however, is a computationally intensive task. We propose a scattering theory framework that dramatically reduces this cost by decomposing networks into components connected by short straight channels. Exploiting the phenomenon of rapid return to Poiseuille flow (Saint-Venant's principle in the context of elasticity), we compute a high-order accurate scattering matrix for each component via boundary integral equations. These precomputed components can then be assembled into arbitrary branched structures, and the precomputed local solutions on each component can be assembled into an accurate global solution. The method is modular, has negligible cost, and appears to be the first full-fidelity solver that makes use of the return to Poiseuille flow phenomenon. In our two-dimensional examples, it matches the accuracy of full-domain solvers while requiring only a fraction of the computational effort.

Materials engineering using atomistic modeling is an essential tool for the development of qubits and quantum sensors. Traditional density-functional theory (DFT) does however not adequately capture the complete physics involved, including key aspects and dynamics of superconductivity, surface states, etc. There are also significant challenges regarding the system sizes that can be simulated, not least for thermal properties which are key in quantum-computing applications. The QuantumATK tool combines DFT, based on LCAO basis sets, with non-equilibrium Green's functions, to compute the characteristics of interfaces between superconductors and insulators, as well as the surface states of topological insulators. Additionally, the software leverages machine-learned force-fields to simulate thermal properties and to generate realistic amorphous geometries in large-scale systems. Finally, the description of superconducting qubits and sensors as two-level systems modeled with a double-well potential requires many-body physics, and this paper demonstrates how electron-electron interaction can be added to the single-particle energy levels from an atomistic tight-binding model to describe a realistic double-quantum dot system.

Phonon engineering technology has opened up the functional thermal management of semiconductor-based classical and quantum electronics at the micro- and nanoscales. However, challenges have remained in designing accurate thermal characteristics based on quasi-ballistic phonon transport. The quasi-ballistic thermal transport arises from the combination of wave-like and diffusive phonon behaviors unlike pure diffusion. The topological nature has been known to be compatible with both wave and diffusive phenomena. Therefore, topological phononic crystals have great potential for the development of controllable and designable thermal transport based on quasi-ballistic phonons. In this study, we experimentally investigated the thermal behavior at the scale of quasi-ballistic phonon transport using a 1D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model-based topological phononic crystal. Quasi-ballistic phonon transport was observed through change in thermal conductivity depending on the structural parameters of topological systems using micro-thermoreflectance. Furthermore, using topological interface states, the experimentally observed thermal behaviors were found to agree well with the theoretically expected those. Accordingly, the topological nature is an effective approach for thermal management in micro- and nanoscale systems with quasi-ballistic phonon transport. Our results pave the way for a unified control scheme for wave and diffusion phenomena, such as quasi-ballistic phonons.

The recent discovery of compressed superconductivity at 80~K in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$-$\delta$ has brought nickelates into the family of unconventional high-temperature superconductors. However, due to the challenges of directly probing the superconducting pairing mechanism under high pressure, the pairing symmetry and gap structures of nickelate superconductors remain under intense debate. In this work, we successfully determine the microscopic information on the superconducting gap structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$-$\delta$ samples subjected to pressures exceeding 20~GPa, by constructing different conductance junctions within diamond anvil cells. By analyzing the temperature-dependent differential conductance spectra within the Blonder--Tinkham--Klapwijk (BTK) model, we have determined the superconducting energy gap at high pressure. The differential conductance curves reveal a two-gap structure with $\Delta_{1} = 23~\mathrm{meV}$ and $\Delta_{2} = 6~\mathrm{meV}$, while the BTK fitting is consistent with an $s$-like, two-gap spectrum. The gap ratio $2\Delta_{s1}(0) / k_{\mathrm{B}}T_{c}$ is found to be 7.61, belonging to a family of strongly coupled superconductors. Our findings provide valuable insights into the superconducting gap structures of the pressure-induced superconducting nickelates.

The simulation of whole-brain dynamics should reproduce realistic spontaneous and evoked neural activity across different scales, including emergent rhythms, spatio-temporal activation patterns, and macroscale complexity. Once a mathematical model is selected, its configuration must be determined by properly setting its parameters. A critical preliminary step in this process is defining an appropriate set of observables to guide the selection of model configurations (parameter tuning), laying the groundwork for quantitative calibration of accurate whole-brain models. Here, we address this challenge by presenting a framework that integrates two complementary tools: The Virtual Brain (TVB) platform for simulating whole-brain dynamics, and the Collaborative Brain Wave Analysis Pipeline (Cobrawap) for analyzing the simulations using a set of standardized metrics. We apply this framework to a 998-node human connectome, using two configurations of the Larter-Breakspear neural mass model: one with the TVB default parameters, the other tuned using Cobrawap. The results reveal that the tuned configuration exhibits several biologically relevant features, absent in the default model for both spontaneous and evoked dynamics. In response to external perturbations, the tuned model generates non-stereotyped, complex spatio-temporal activity, as measured by the perturbational complexity index. In spontaneous activity, it displays robust alpha-band oscillations, infra-slow rhythms, scale-free characteristics, greater spatio-temporal heterogeneity, and asymmetric functional connectivity. This work demonstrates the potential of combining TVB and Cobrawap to guide parameter tuning and lays the groundwork for data-driven calibration and validation of accurate whole-brain models.

The field of gravitational wave (GW) detection is progressing rapidly, with several next-generation observatories on the horizon, including LISA. GW data is challenging to analyze due to highly variable signals shaped by source properties and the presence of complex noise. These factors emphasize the need for robust, advanced analysis tools. In this context, we have initiated the development of a low-latency GW detection pipeline based on quantum neural networks (QNNs). Previously, we demonstrated that QNNs can recognize GWs simulated using post-Newtonian approximations in the Newtonian limit. We then extended this work using data from the LISA Consortium, training QNNs to distinguish between noisy GW signals and pure noise. Currently, we are evaluating performance on the Sangria LISA Data Challenge dataset and comparing it against classical methods. Our results show that QNNs can reliably distinguish GW signals embedded in noise, achieving classification accuracies above 98\%. Notably, our QNN identified 5 out of 6 mergers in the Sangria blind dataset. The remaining merger, characterized by the lowest amplitude, highlights an area for future improvement in model sensitivity. This can potentially be addressed using additional mock training datasets, which we are preparing, and by testing different QNN architectures and ansatzes.

In cold, dense astrophysical environments dust grains are mixed with molecular ices. Chemistry in those dust/ice mixtures is determined by diffusion and reaction of molecules and radicals. However, investigations of diffusion of astrophysically relevant radicals and molecules across the surface and through the pores of cosmic dust grains and of surface reactions consequent to such diffusion is largely uncharted territory. This paper presents results of a study of a solid-state reaction of two molecular species, CO2 and NH3, separated by a layer of porous silicate grain aggregates, analogues of cosmic dust. The experiments demonstrate that the presence of the dust layer was necessary for a pure thermal CO2 + 2NH3 reaction to proceed, leading to the formation of ammonium carbamate (NH4+NH2COO-), an ionic solid containing a complex organic moiety of prebiotic interest recently detected in a protoplanetary disk. This result speaks for: (i) efficient diffusion of molecules on/within cosmic dust, (ii) an underestimated role for surface catalysis in the astrochemistry of cosmic dust, and (iii) potentially efficient dust-promoted chemistry in warm cosmic environments, such as protostellar envelopes and protoplanetary disks.

The notorious sign problem severely limits the applicability of quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations, as statistical errors grow exponentially with system size and inverse temperature. A recent proposal of a quantum-computing stochastic series expansion (qc-SSE) method suggested that the problem could be avoided by introducing constant energy shifts into the Hamiltonian. Here we critically examine this framework and show that it does not strictly resolve the sign problem for Hamiltonians with non-commuting terms. Instead, it provides a practical mitigation strategy that suppresses the occurrence of negative weights. Using the antiferromagnetic anisotropic XY chain as a test case, we analyze the dependence of the average sign on system size, temperature, anisotropy, and shift parameters. An operator contraction method is introduced to improve efficiency. Our results demonstrate that moderate shifts optimally balance sign mitigation and statistical accuracy, while large shifts amplify errors, leaving the sign problem unresolved but alleviated.

Boron-doped diamond crystals (BDD, C$_{1-x}$B$_{x}$) exhibit exceptional mechanical strength, electronic tunability, and resistance to radiation damage. This makes them promising materials for use in gamma-ray crystal-based light sources. To better understand and quantify the structural distortions introduced by doping, which are critical for maintaining channelling efficiency, we perform atomistic-level molecular dynamics simulations on periodic C$_{1-x}$B$_{x}$ systems of various sizes. These simulations allow the influence of boron concentration on the lattice constant and the (110) and (100) inter-planar distances to be evaluated over the concentration range from pure diamond (0%) to 5% boron at room temperature (300 K). Linear relationships between both lattice constant and inter-planar distance with increasing dopant concentration are observed, with a deviation from Vegard's Law. This deviation is larger than that reported by other theoretical and computational studies; however, this may be attributed to an enhanced crystal quality over these studies, a vital aspect when considering gamma-ray crystal light source design. The methodology presented here incorporates several refinements to closely reflect the conditions of microwave plasma chemical vapour deposition (MPCVD) crystal growth. Validation of the methodology is provided through a comprehensive statistical analysis of the structure of our generated crystals. These results enable reliable atomistic modelling of doped diamond crystals and support their use in the design and fabrication of periodically bent structures for next-generation gamma-ray light source technologies.

Tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) is a powerful method for imaging vibrational motion and chemically characterizing surface-bound systems. Theoretical simulations of TERS images often consider systems in isolation, ignoring any substrate support, such as metallic surfaces. Here, we show that this omission leads to deviations from experimentally measured data through simulations with a new finite-field formulation of first-principles simulation of TERS spectra that can address extended, periodic systems. We show that TERS images of tetracyanoethylene on Ag(100) and defective MoS$_2$ monolayers calculated using isolated molecules or cluster models are qualitatively different from those calculated when accounting for the periodicity of the substrate. For Mg(II)-porphine on Ag(100), a system for which a direct experimental comparison is possible, these simulations prove to be crucial for explaining the spatial variation of TERS intensity patterns and allow us to uncover fundamental principles of TERS spectroscopy. We explain how and why surface interactions affect images of out-of-plane vibrational modes much more than those of in-plane modes, providing an important tool for the future interpretation of these images in more complex systems.

Cyclic Variational Quantum Eigensolver: Escaping Barren Plateaus through Staircase Descent

We introduce the Cyclic Variational Quantum Eigensolver (CVQE), a hardware-efficient framework for accurate ground-state quantum simulation on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. CVQE departs from conventional VQE by incorporating a measurement-driven feedback cycle: Slater determinants with significant sampling probability are iteratively added to the reference superposition, while a fixed entangler (e.g., single-layer UCCSD) is reused throughout. This adaptive reference growth systematically enlarges the variational space in most promising directions, avoiding manual ansatz or operator-pool design, costly searches, and preserving compile-once circuits. The strategy parallels multi-reference methods in quantum chemistry, while remaining fully automated on quantum hardware. Remarkably, CVQE exhibits a distinctive staircase-like descent pattern, where successive energy drops sharply signal efficient escape from barren plateaus. Benchmarks show that CVQE consistently maintains chemical precision across correlation regimes, outperforms fixed UCCSD by several orders of magnitude, and achieves favorable accuracy-cost trade-offs compared to the Selected Configuration Interaction. These results position CVQE as a scalable, interpretable, and resource-efficient paradigm for near-term quantum simulation.

The CUbesat Solar Polarimeter (CUSP) project is a CubeSat mission planned for a launch in low-Earth orbit and aimed to measure the linear polarization of solar flares in the hard X-ray band by means of a Compton scattering polarimeter. CUSP will allow us to study the magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration in the flaring magnetic structures of our star. CUSP is a project in the framework of the Alcor Program of the Italian Space Agency aimed at developing new CubeSat missions. It is undergoing a 12-month Phase B that started in December 2024.
The Compton polarimeter on board CUSP is composed of two acquisition chains based on plastic scintillators read out by Multi-Anode PhotoMultiplier Tubes for the scatterer part and GAGG crystals coupled to Avalanche PhotoDiodes for the absorbers. An event coincident between the two readout schemes will lead to a measurement of the incoming X-ray's azimuthal scattering angle, linked to the polarization of the solar flare in a statistical manner. The current status of the CUSP mission design, mission analysis, and payload scientific performance will be reported. The latter will be discussed based on preliminary laboratory results obtained in parallel with Geant4 simulations.

Quantum random number generators (QRNGs) produce true random numbers, which are guaranteed by the fundamental principles of quantum physics. Miniaturization of QRNGs is crucial for a wide range of communication and cryptography applications. Here, we first report a fully functional QRNG chip based on vacuum-state fluctuations, with dimensions of 16.6 mm x 7.8 mm. The quantum entropy source, which is achieved via hybrid photonic integration with a SiO2 waveguide, generates raw quantum random numbers. The hybrid photonic and electrical components are assembled into a compact ceramic package using system-in-package technology. A microcontroller unit acquires the raw data and outputs the processed quantum random numbers via a serial peripheral interface. According to the characterization results, the QRNG chip achieves a constant real-time output rate of 5.2 Mbps across the industrial temperature range of -40°C to 85°C, making it suitable for practical applications.

Curriculum Learning for Mesh-based simulations

Machine Learning (cs.LG); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph)
Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful surrogates for mesh-based computational fluid dynamics (CFD), but training them on high-resolution unstructured meshes with hundreds of thousands of nodes remains prohibitively expensive. We study a \emph{coarse-to-fine curriculum} that accelerates convergence by first training on very coarse meshes and then progressively introducing medium and high resolutions (up to \(3\times10^5\) nodes). Unlike multiscale GNN architectures, the model itself is unchanged; only the fidelity of the training data varies over time. We achieve comparable generalization accuracy while reducing total wall-clock time by up to 50\%. Furthermore, on datasets where our model lacks the capacity to learn the underlying physics, using curriculum learning enables it to break through plateaus.

This paper aims to explore the impact of tournament design on the incentives of the contestants. We develop a simulation framework to quantify the potential gain and loss from attacking based on changes in the probability of reaching the critical ranking thresholds. The model is applied to investigate the 2024/25 UEFA Champions League reform. The novel incomplete round-robin league phase is found to create more powerful incentives for offensive play than the previous group stage, with an average increase of 119\% (58\%) regarding the first (second) prize. Our study provides the first demonstration that the tournament format itself can strongly influence team behaviour in sports.

We present a direct inverse modeling method named SURGIN, a SURrogate-guided Generative INversion framework tailed for subsurface multiphase flow data assimilation. Unlike existing inversion methods that require adaptation for each new observational configuration, SURGIN features a zero-shot conditional generation capability, enabling real-time assimilation of unseen monitoring data without task-specific retraining. Specifically, SURGIN synergistically integrates a U-Net enhanced Fourier Neural Operator (U-FNO) surrogate with a score-based generative model (SGM), framing the conditional generation as a surrogate prediction-guidance process in a Bayesian perspective. Instead of directly learning the conditional generation of geological parameters, an unconditional SGM is first pretrained in a self-supervised manner to capture the geological prior, after which posterior sampling is performed by leveraging a differentiable U-FNO surrogate to enable efficient forward evaluations conditioned on unseen observations. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate SURGIN's capability to decently infer heterogeneous geological fields and predict spatiotemporal flow dynamics with quantified uncertainty across diverse measurement settings. By unifying generative learning with surrogate-guided Bayesian inference, SURGIN establishes a new paradigm for inverse modeling and uncertainty quantification in parametric functional spaces.

A disordered quasi-liquid layer of water is thought to cover the ice surface, but many issues, such as its onset temperature, its thickness, or its actual relation to bulk liquid water have been a matter of unsettled controversy for more than a century. In this perspective article, current computer simulations and experimental results are discussed under the light of a suitable theoretical framework. It is found that using a combination of wetting physics, the theory of intermolecular forces, statistical mechanics and out of equilibrium physics a large number of conflicting results can be reconciled and collected into a consistent description of the ice surface. This helps understand the crucial role of surface properties in a range of important applications, from the enigmatic structure of snow crystals to the slipperiness of ice.

Fast Unbiased Sampling of Networks with Given Expected Degrees and Strengths

The configuration model is a cornerstone of statistical assessment of network structure. While the Chung-Lu model is among the most widely used configuration models, it systematically oversamples edges between large-degree nodes, leading to inaccurate statistical conclusions. Although the maximum entropy principle offers unbiased configuration models, its high computational cost has hindered widespread adoption, making the Chung-Lu model an inaccurate yet persistently practical choice. Here, we propose fast and efficient sampling algorithms for the max-entropy-based models by adapting the Miller-Hagberg algorithm. Evaluation on 103 empirical networks demonstrates 10-1000 times speedup, making theoretically rigorous configuration models practical and contributing to a more accurate understanding of network structure.

We detail experimental results inferring ionization and temperature for warm dense copper plasmas at several times solid density (15 to 25 g/cm$^3$) and temperatures of 10 to 21 eV. Experiments performed at the OMEGA Laser Facility generate uniform warm dense matter conditions via symmetric shock compression of a buried copper layer. The plasma is probed with a laser-generated x-ray source to collect the K-shell x-ray absorption spectrum. Fitting bound-bound absorption contributions from constituent charge states of copper provides an estimated $\overline{Z}$ of approximately 4 to 7 for these warm dense copper plasmas. We find that these partially ionized plasmas have K-edge shifts of 12 to 30 eV and bound-bound resonance 1s$\rightarrow$3p absorption shifts of 4 to 26 eV with respect to the cold K-edge. This study provides necessary experimental data to improve ionization and opacity models in the warm dense matter regime.

We characterize sets of fractional orbital angular momentum (OAM) modes of a light beam using unitary-invariant properties encoded by two-mode overlaps. Using basis-independent coherence and dimension witnesses, we experimentally certify, on a triple of fractional modes, both the presence of coherence and that the states necessarily span a space of dimension 3. We propose and implement a practical, fast experimental method to extract two-mode overlaps requiring only a single intensity image per interference pair. These results lay the groundwork for using fractional OAM states in high-dimensional quantum information protocols.

Subjects:

Long-range interactions are essential determinants of chemical system behaviour across diverse environments. We present a foundation framework that integrates explicit polarizable long-range physics with an equivariant graph neural network potential. It employs a physically motivated polarizable charge equilibration scheme that directly optimizes electrostatic interaction energies rather than partial charges. The foundation model, trained across the periodic table up to Pu, demonstrates strong performance across key materials modelling challenges. It effectively captures long-range interactions that are challenging for traditional message-passing mechanisms and accurately reproduces polarization effects under external electric fields. We have applied the model to mechanical properties, ionic diffusivity in solid-state electrolytes, ferroelectric phase transitions, and reactive dynamics at electrode-electrolyte interfaces, highlighting the model's capacity to balance accuracy and computational efficiency. Furthermore, we show that as a foundation model, it can be efficiently finetuned to achieve high-level accuracy for specific challenging systems.

This work introduces and characterizes a theoretical model of a reflective polarimetric measurement technique determining the surface stress of a dielectric material, e.g. glass. We have developed a procedure to reconstruct the actual stress state, which is the orientation and value of the principal axes of stress, from the calculated Stokes vector components that would appear as polarization signals in a measurement. We consider a special geometry of the principle stress axis, where we chose one of them to be perpendicular to the surface and relaxed to a zero value. Our new approach of reconstructing surface stress states from reflected polarization states embraces the determination of the reflection Müller matrix. With that and an initial Stokes vector, the resulting reflected Stokes vector is calculated to create a database. The database represents the dependence of the resulting Stokes vector on the initial Stokes vector and the stress states included in the reflection matrix, which is iteratively calculated for several stress components and its orientations. Introducing a model for the dependency of the reflected Stokes vector components on the stress states and fitting it to the database results in a system of equations of those dependencies which are solved for the stress state components and orientation. Finally, we found a theoretical determination accuracy of the model for surface stress magnitude to be of the order of a few MPa.

EdSr: A Novel End-to-End Approach for State-Space Sampling in Molecular Dynamics Simulation
Hai-Ming Cao, Bin Li
Subjects:
Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph)
The molecular dynamics (MD) simulation technique has been widely used in complex systems, but the accessible time scale is limited due to the requirement of small integration timesteps. Here, we propose a novel method, named Exploratory dynamics Sampling with recursion (EdSr), inspired by ordinary differential equation and Taylor expansion formula, which enables flexible adjustment of timestep in MD simulations. By setting up four groups of experiments including simple functions, ideal physical models, all-atom simulations and coarse-grained simulations, we demonstrate that EdSr can dynamically and flexibly adjust the simulation timestep according to the requirements during simulation period, and operate with larger timesteps than the widely used velocity-Verlet integrator. Although the method can not perform perfectly at flexible timestep across all simulation systems, we believe that it provides a promising direction for future studies.

Ultra-sensitive quantification of trace radioactive krypton-85 is essential for low-background experiments, particularly for next-generation searches of galactic dark matter and neutrino physics using xenon-based time projection chambers (TPCs). While the rare gas mass spectrometer (RGMS) represents the current state-of-the-art for krypton detection in the field, we are developing a fully automated system (Auto-RGMS) to overcome the limitations of its manual operation. Auto-RGMS incorporates a robust control system for rapid measurements and minimized systematic uncertainties. A primary goal is to reach detection limits in the low parts-per-quadrillion (ppq) range for natural krypton by improving the chromatography stage to enhance the separation of krypton from xenon. Investigations into various adsorbent materials identified two candidates. HayeSep Q offers a 12-fold improvement in chromatographic resolution for xenon/krypton separation compared to the previously used adsorbent. Alternatively, HayeSep D provides a more limited improvement in resolution while allowing a higher measurement frequency because of its moderate retention-induced contamination after each measurement. By automating krypton assays and achieving ppq sensitivity, Auto-RGMS will be an indispensable tool for next-generation detectors, maximizing their scientific potential.

The study of multiphase flows in porous media is fundamental to various fields, including oil recovery, CO2 sequestration, hydrogeology, and others. Accurate predictions of fluid behavior in these systems can enhance process efficiency while mitigating environmental and health risks. In this context, numerical simulation serves as a powerful tool for anticipating complex flow phenomena and optimizing engineering strategies. Both commercial simulators and open-source softwares, such as the porousMultiphaseFoam repository based on the OpenFOAM framework, have been developed to model these processes. However, simulating heterogeneous porous media with complex porosity and permeability distributions poses significant numerical challenges. To address these, we introduce coupledMatrixFoam, a new OpenFOAM-based solver designed for enhanced robustness and numerical stability. coupledMatrixFoam integrates the Eulerian multi-fluid formulation for phase fractions with Darcy's law for porous media flow, employing a fully implicit, block-coupled solution for the governing equations. Built on foam-extend 5.0, it leverages the latest fvBlockMatrix developments to improve computational efficiency. This approach enables a significant increase in time step sizes, particularly in cases involving capillary pressure effects and other complex physical interactions. This work details the development, implementation, and validation of coupledMatrixFoam, including comparisons with porousMultiphaseFoam to assess performance improvements. Additionally, a scalability analysis is conducted, demonstrating the solver's suitability for high-performance computing (HPC) applications, which are essential for large-scale, real-world simulations.

Investigating the use of terrain-following coordinates in AI-driven precipitation forecasts

Subjects:
Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics (physics.ao-ph); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)
Artificial Intelligence (AI) weather prediction (AIWP) models often produce ``blurry'' precipitation forecasts. This study presents a novel solution to tackle this problem -- integrating terrain-following coordinates into AIWP models. Forecast experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of terrain-following coordinates using FuXi, an example AIWP model, adapted to 1.0 degree grid spacing data. Verification results show a largely improved estimation of extreme events and precipitation intensity spectra. Terrain-following coordinates are also found to collaborate well with global mass and energy conservation constraints, with a clear reduction of drizzle bias. Case studies reveal that terrain-following coordinates can represent near-surface winds better, which helps AIWP models in learning the relationships between precipitation and other prognostic variables. The result of this study suggests that terrain-following coordinates are worth considering for AIWP models in producing more accurate precipitation forecasts.

Groups of cells, including clusters of cancerous cells, multicellular organisms, and developing organs, may both grow and break apart. What physical factors control these fractures? In these processes, what sets the eventual size of clusters? We first develop a one-dimensional framework for understanding cell clusters that can fragment due to cell motility using an active particle model. We compute analytically how the break rate of cell-cell junctions depends on cell speed, cell persistence, and cell-cell junction properties. Next, we find the cluster size distributions, which differ depending on whether all cells can divide or only the cells on the edge of the cluster divide. Cluster size distributions depend solely on the ratio of the break rate to the growth rate - allowing us to predict how cluster size and variability depend on cell motility and cell-cell mechanics. Our results suggest that organisms can achieve better size control when cell division is restricted to the cluster boundaries or when fracture can be localized to the cluster center. Additionally, we derive a universal survival probability for an intact cluster $S(t)=\mathrm{e}^{-k_d t}$ at steady state if all cells can divide, which is independent of the rupture kinetics and depends solely on the cell division rate $k_d$. Finally, we further corroborate the one-dimensional analytics with two-dimensional simulations, finding quantitative agreement with some elements of the theory across a wide range of cell motility. Our results link the general physics problem of a collective active escape over a barrier to size control, providing a quantitative measure of how motility can regulate organ or organism size.

Monitoring $^{90}$Sr contamination in milk following a nuclear accident is critical due to its radiotoxicity and calcium-mimicking behaviour, leading to accumulation in bones and teeth. This study presents a high-efficiency protocol for quantifying$^{90}$Sr in cow milk by integrating freeze-drying, high-temperature calcination, ion exchange chromatography and liquid scintillation spectroscopy (LSC). The method was validated using reference milk samples with 0.45~Bq/mL of $^{90}$Sr, achieving a chemical yield of 100 $\pm$ 2\%, ensuring near-complete recovery and accurate quantification.
The minimum detectable activity (MDA) was estimated at 0.33 Bq/L under optimal conditions, demonstrating the protocol's sensitivity for low-level detection. A comparative analysis with existing methods centrifugation-based approaches and Dowex resin techniques revealed that our protocol outperforms in both strontium recovery and organic matter elimination. Alternative methods showed lower recovery rates (68 $\pm$ 2\% for Guérin's method, 65 $\pm$6\% for Dowex resin) and suffered from procedural drawbacks, such as incomplete organic matter removal.
Applying this methodology to compare samples from certified laboratories confirmed its robustness, with liquid scintillation spectroscopy radioactivity values doubling after 14 days, consistent with secular equilibrium between $^{90}$Sr and $^{90}$Y. While the protocol is optimized for milk, future research should explore its applicability to other food matrices. The high yield, reliability, and ease of implementation position this method as an effective tool for nuclear emergency response and routine radiological monitoring.

Spin-Orbit Coupling in Helical Waveguides: A Local Duality Perspective and Emergent Gauge Fields
Lili Yang, Longlong Feng, Pengming Zhang
Subjects:
Optics (physics.optics)
Dual symmetry is an intrinsic property of Maxwell's equations, corresponding to a global U(1) symmetry in vacuum, with helicity as the associated conserved quantity. In this paper, we investigate light propagation in a spin-degenerate medium using a field-theoretical approach and introduce an effective gauge field A_s that emerges from the localization of dual symmetry. Within the geometric optics approximation, we show that the helical trajectory of light rays reveals this gauge field as a manifestation of spin-orbit coupling. Although orbital-orbit coupling also arises in such systems, the spin-orbit interaction possesses deeper physical significance, as it originates from the intrinsic dual symmetry embedded in Maxwell's equations.

HiLAB (Hybrid inverse-design with Latent-space learning, Adjoint-based partial optimizations, and Bayesian optimization) is a new paradigm for inverse design of nanophotonic structures. Combining early-terminated topological optimization (TO) with a Vision Transformer-based variational autoencoder (VAE) and a Bayesian search, HiLAB addresses multi-functional device design by generating diverse freeform configurations at reduced simulation costs. Shortened adjoint-driven TO runs, coupled with randomized physical parameters, produce robust initial structures. These structures are compressed into a compact latent space by the VAE, enabling Bayesian optimization to co-optimize geometry and physical hyperparameters. Crucially, the trained VAE can be reused for alternative objectives or constraints by adjusting only the acquisition function. Compared to conventional TO pipelines prone to local optima, HiLAB systematically explores near-global optima with considerably fewer electromagnetic simulations. Even after accounting for training overhead, the total number of full simulations decreases by over an order of magnitude, accelerating the discovery of fabrication-friendly devices. Demonstrating its efficacy, HiLAB is used to design an achromatic beam deflector for red, green, and blue wavelengths, achieving balanced diffraction efficiencies of ~25% while mitigating chromatic aberrations-a performance surpassing existing demonstrations. Overall, HiLAB provides a flexible platform for robust, multi-parameter photonic designs and rapid adaptation to next-generation nanophotonic challenges.

Overshooting tops (OTs) are informative indicators of convective storm intensity and are widely utilized in meteorological analyses. This study presents an automated algorithm for OT detection and OT height estimation using convolutional neural networks applied to visible satellite imagery. The models are trained and validated on an extensive OT dataset comprising approximately 10,000 manually detected cases over Europe. The OTs were identified from high-resolution visible (HRV) channel of the SEVIRI instrument on board the MSG geostationary satellite, with the heights determined from the length of their shadows in the imagery. While conventional OT detection methods primarily rely on the identification of cold features in thermal infrared channels, our approach extracts information from visible channels, leveraging the ground truth data on OT shadow length provided by the training dataset. In the morning and afternoon hours, when the shadows are visible, the proposed models detect OTs with a probability of detection reaching 97% and estimate their height with an average error of 0.25 km. The performance is expected to further improve once the model is applied to polar and new generation geostationary satellites with increased spatial resolution.

Driven Collisionless Reconnection of Force-free Flux Tubes: From Onset to Coalescence

We investigate the onset of driven collisionless reconnection and plasmoid formation in a magnetically dominated pair plasma, using 2D Particle-in-Cell simulations. Two force-free flux tubes of radius $R$ are initially pushed together with a prescribed velocity, forming a current sheet whose width shrinks until reconnection sets in. % Even in our largest simulation with $R\approx 1600$ plasma skin depths, the sheet thickness at reconnection onset is comparable to the skin depth. Plasmoid chains develop when the sheet length-to-width aspect ratio $A\gtrsim30$. In the strongly magnetized limit, the onset of reconnection occurs in roughly 2--6 light-crossing times, depending on the imposed driving timescale, which controls the duration of the thinning phase. In the subsequent nonlinear merging phase, the evolution becomes effectively independent of the initially imposed velocity, leading to magnetic-energy dissipation consistent with a normalized reconnection rate $\sim 0.1$. Our results have important implications for explosive release of magnetic energy in magnetospheres of astrophysical compact objects and their surroundings.

OGF: An Online Gradient Flow Method for Optimizing the Statistical Steady-State Time Averages of Unsteady Turbulent Flows

Turbulent flows are chaotic and unsteady, but their statistical distribution converges to a statistical steady state. Engineering quantities of interest typically take the form of time-average statistics such as $ \frac{1}{t} \int_0^t f ( u(x,\tau; \theta) ) d\tau \overset{t \rightarrow \infty}{\rightarrow} F(x; \theta)$, where $u(x,t; \theta)$ are solutions of the Navier--Stokes equations with parameters $\theta$. Optimizing over $F(x; \theta)$ has many engineering applications including geometric optimization, flow control, and closure modeling. However, this remains an open challenge, as existing computational approaches are incapable of scaling to physically representative numbers of grid points. The fundamental obstacle is the chaoticity of turbulent flows: gradients calculated with the adjoint method diverge exponentially as $t \rightarrow \infty$.
We develop a new online gradient-flow (OGF) method that is scalable to large degree-of-freedom systems and enables optimizing for the steady-state statistics of chaotic, unsteady, turbulence-resolving simulations. The method forward-propagates an online estimate for the gradient of $F(x; \theta)$ while simultaneously performing online updates of the parameters $\theta$. A key feature is the fully online nature of the algorithm to facilitate faster optimization progress and its combination with a finite-difference estimator to avoid the divergence of gradients due to chaoticity. The proposed OGF method is demonstrated for optimizations over three chaotic ordinary and partial differential equations: the Lorenz-63 equation, the Kuramoto--Sivashinsky equation, and Navier--Stokes solutions of compressible, forced, homogeneous isotropic turbulence. In each case, the OGF method successfully reduces the loss based on $F(x; \theta)$ by several orders of magnitude and accurately recovers the optimal parameters.

Real-time, Adaptive Radiological Anomaly Detection and Isotope Identification Using Non-negative Matrix Factorization

Spectroscopic anomaly detection and isotope identification algorithms are integral components in nuclear nonproliferation applications such as search operations. The task is especially challenging in the case of mobile detector systems due to the fact that the observed gamma-ray background changes more than for a static detector system, and a pretrained background model can easily find itself out of domain. The result is that algorithms may exceed their intended false alarm rate, or sacrifice detection sensitivity in order to maintain the desired false alarm rate. Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has been shown to be a powerful tool for spectral anomaly detection and identification, but, like many similar algorithms that rely on data-driven background models, in its conventional implementation it is unable to update in real time to account for environmental changes that affect the background spectroscopic signature. We have developed a novel NMF-based algorithm that periodically updates its background model to accommodate changing environmental conditions. The Adaptive NMF algorithm involves fewer assumptions about its environment, making it more generalizable than existing NMF-based methods while maintaining or exceeding detection performance on simulated and real-world datasets.

This study investigated the pulsating instability of burner-stabilized premixed CH4-O2 flames at various levels of CO2 dilution. Experiments were conducted using a water-cooled porous-plug burner of 18 mm diameter over a wide range of mixture compositions and flow rates, during which time-resolved measurements of flame chemiluminescence and gas temperature were obtained. The primary oscillation frequencies of the pulsating flames were determined using fast Fourier transform and harmonic power analysis. Phase-locked analysis of the chemiluminescence images revealed an interesting mode-transition phenomenon of the flame oscillations. Under fuel-rich conditions with relatively low heat release rates and low flow rates, the flames exhibited quasi-periodic single-mode oscillations. These oscillations were modulated by low-frequency flame flickering instabilities at elevated flow rates, which created sidebands around the primary oscillation frequency. At higher heat release rates, the flickering instability further triggered mode splitting, eventually leading to multi-mode oscillations. Regime diagrams of the flame oscillation modes, as well as the stability boundaries, were obtained under various fuel flow rates. These findings can be useful for both fundamental research on flame dynamics and practical applications of CO$_2$-moderated oxy-combustion.

Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph)
We present a generative modeling framework for atomistic systems that combines score-based diffusion for atomic positions with a novel continuous-time discrete diffusion process for atomic types. This approach enables flexible and physically grounded generation of atomic structures across chemical and structural domains. Applied to metallic clusters and two-dimensional materials using the QCD and C2DB datasets, our models achieve strong performance in fidelity and diversity, evaluated using precision-recall metrics against synthetic baselines. We demonstrate atomic type interpolation for generating bimetallic clusters beyond the training distribution, and use classifier-free guidance to steer sampling toward specific crystallographic symmetries in two-dimensional materials. These capabilities are implemented in Atomistic Generative Diffusion (AGeDi), an open-source, extensible software package for atomistic generative diffusion modeling.

Propagation and collisionless damping of topologically-protected surface plasma waves in non-uniformly magnetized plasma columns

Subjects:
Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph)
Recent theoretical studies revealed the existence of topologically-protected surface plasma waves (TSPWs) in cold magnetized plasmas assumed uniform along the direction of a uniaxial magnetic field. Reflections-free propagation of the TSPWs along arbitrarily-shaped plasma boundaries oriented perpendicularly to the magnetic field was shown to be preserved even when their collisionless damping by localized upper-hybrid resonances was accounted for. Here we extend this theory to the realistic case of three-dimensional magnetic field produced by finite-sized magnetic coils. We demonstrate that when TSPWs are launched in the direction of the decreasing magnetic field, they are collisionlessly absorbed within a highly localized (evanescent) region as they propagate away from the magnetic coil. We show that the resulting wave reflection can be negligible -- in clear contrast with conventional wave reflection from the corresponding evanescence regions.

Ion Cyclotron Range of Frequencies (ICRF) heating is essential for creating plasma in next-generation fusion devices. ICRF antennas often produce hot spots, reducing reliability, material survivability, and overall plasma performance. We show that toroidal and poloidal asymmetries in these hot spots arise intrinsically from the wave physics' gyrotropy, and that they can be compensated for either by controlling the poloidal phasing or by modifying the limiter shapes, reducing total erosion by a factor $\sim$2 compared to state-of-the-art designs.

Network connectivity analysis via shortest paths

Subjects:
Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph); Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
Complex systems of interacting components often can be modeled by a simple graph $\mathcal{G}$ that consists of a set of $n$ nodes and a set of $m$ edges. Such a graph can be represented by an adjacency matrix $A\in\R^{n\times n}$, whose $(ij)$th entry is one if there is an edge pointing from node $i$ to node $j$, and is zero otherwise. The matrix $A$ and its positive integer powers reveal important properties of the graph and allow the construction of the path length matrix $L$ for the graph. The $(ij)$th entry of $L$ is the length of the shortest path from node $i$ to node $j$; if there is no path between these nodes, then the value of the entry is set to $\infty$. We are interested in how well information flows via shortest paths of the graph. This can be studied with the aid of the path length matrix. The path length matrix allows the definition of several measures of communication in the network defined by the graph such as the global $K$-efficiency, which considers shortest paths that are made up of at most $K$ edges for some $K<n$, as well as the number of such shortest paths. Novel notions of connectivity introduced in this paper help us understand the importance of specific edges for the flow of information through the graph. This is of interest when seeking to simplify a network by removing selected edges or trying to assess the sensitivity of the flow of information to changes due to exterior causes such as a traffic stoppage on a road network.

Physics-informed machine learning for combustion: A review

Subjects:
Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph)
Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) represents an emerging paradigm that integrates various forms of physical knowledge into machine learning (ML) components, thereby enhancing the physical consistency of ML models compared to purely data-driven paradigms. The field of combustion, characterized by a rich foundation of physical laws and abundant data, is undergoing a transformation due to PIML. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of PIML for combustion, systematically outlining fundamental principles, significant contributions, key advancements, and available resources. The application of PIML in combustion is categorized into three domains: combustion chemical kinetics, combustion reacting flows, and other combustion-related problems. Additionally, current challenges, potential solutions, and practical guidelines for researchers and engineers will be discussed. A primary focus of this review is to demonstrate how combustion laws can be integrated into ML, either through soft or hard constraints, via loss functions or representation models, and within coordinate-to-variable or field-to-field paradigms. This paper shows that PIML offers a unified framework linking physics, model, and data in combustion--integrating physical knowledge in model-to-data simulation and reconstruction tasks, as well as data-to-model modeling tasks--resulting in enhanced data, improved physical models, and more reliable ML models. PIML for combustion presents significant opportunities for both the combustion and ML communities, encouraging greater collaboration and cross-disciplinary engagement.

Accurate visualization of interventional devices, such as medical needles, is essential for the safe and effective guidance of minimally invasive procedures. Ultrasound (US) imaging is widely used for needle guidance, but the two-dimensional nature of most clinical probes limits accurate three-dimensional (3D) localization, particularly of the needle tip. We present a novel system that integrates volumetric US imaging with 3D needle tracking by combining a fiber-optic hydrophone embedded in the needle and a sparse spiral US array. Real-time volumetric imaging was achieved using plane-wave techniques, while precise needle tip tracking was enabled through communication between the probe and hydrophone. The feasibility of the approach was demonstrated using a nerve block training phantom. This proof-of-concept system enables simultaneous volumetric anatomical imaging and 3D needle tip tracking, with strong potential to enhance the efficacy and safety of image-guided interventional procedures.

The impact of kinetic and global effects on ballooning 2nd stable pedestals of conventional and high aspect ratio tokamaks

Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph)
The EPED model [P.B. Snyder et al 2011 Nucl. Fusion 51 103016] had success in describing type-I ELM and QH-mode pedestals in conventional tokamaks, by combining kinetic ballooning mode (KBM) and peeling-ballooning (PB) constraints. Within EPED, the KBM constraint is usually approximated by the ideal ballooning mode (IBM) stability threshold. It has been noted that quantitative differences between local ideal MHD and gyro-kinetic (GK) ballooning stability can be larger at low aspect ratio. KBM critical pedestals are consistent with observation in initial studies on conventional and spherical tokamaks. In this work, the application of a reduced model for the calculation of the kinetic ballooning stability boundary is presented based on a novel and newly developed Gyro-Fluid System (GFS) code [G.M. Staebler et al 2023 Phys. Plasmas 30 102501]. GFS is observed to capture KBMs in DIII-D as well as the NSTX(-U) pedestals, opening the route for the integration of this model into EPED. Finally, high-n global ballooning modes are observed to limit local 2nd stability access and thus provide a transport mechanism that constrains the width evolution with beta_p,ped. The high-n global ballooning stability is approximated by its ideal MHD analogue using ELITE. It is shown that nearly local high-n with k_y*rho_s~1/2 modes can provide a proxy for the critical beta_p,ped when 2nd stable access exists on DIII-D plasmas. The use of GFS and ELITE scaling in EPED provided improved agreement in comparison to EPED1 with DIII-D pedestal data.

Electron-positron colliders operating in the GeV region of center-of-mass energies or the Tau-Charm energy region, have been proven to enable competitive frontier research, due to its several unique features. With the progress of high energy physics in the last two decades, a new-generation Tau-Charm factory, Super Tau Charm Facility (STCF) has been actively promoting by the particle physics community in China. STCF holds great potential to address fundamental questions such as the essence of color confinement and the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe in the next decades. The main design goals of STCF are with a center-of-mass energy ranging from 2 to 7 GeV and a peak luminosity surpassing 5*10^34 cm^-2s^-1 that is optimized at a center-of-mass energy of 4 GeV, which is about 50 times that of the currently operating Tau-Charm factory - BEPCII. The STCF accelerator is composed of two main parts: a double-ring collider with the crab-waist collision scheme and an injector that provides top-up injections for both electron and positron beams. As a typical third-generation electron-positron circular collider, the STCF accelerator faces many challenges in both accelerator physics and technology. In this paper, the conceptual design of the STCF accelerator complex is presented, including the ongoing efforts and plans for technological R&D, as well as the required infrastructure. The STCF project aims to secure support from the Chinese central government for its construction during the 15th Five-Year Plan (2026-2030) in China.

Submarine cables play a critical role in global internet connectivity, energy transmission, and communication but remain vulnerable to accidental damage and sabotage. Recent incidents in the Baltic Sea highlighted the need for enhanced monitoring to protect this vital infrastructure. Traditional vessel detection methods, such as synthetic aperture radar, video surveillance, and multispectral satellite imagery, face limitations in real-time processing, adverse weather conditions, and coverage range. This paper explores Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) as an alternative by repurposing submarine telecommunication cables as large-scale acoustic sensor arrays. DAS offers continuous real-time monitoring, operates independently of cooperative systems like the "Automatic Identification System" (AIS), being largely unaffected by lighting or weather conditions. However, existing research on DAS for vessel tracking is limited in scale and lacks validation under real-world conditions. To address these gaps, a general and systematic methodology is presented for vessel detection and distance estimation using DAS. Advanced machine learning models are applied to improve detection and localization accuracy in dynamic maritime environments. The approach is evaluated over a continuous ten-day period, covering diverse ship and operational conditions, representing one of the largest-scale DAS-based vessel monitoring studies to date, and for which we release the full evaluation dataset. Results demonstrate DAS as a practical tool for maritime surveillance, with an overall F1-score of over 90% in vessel detection, and a mean average error of 141 m for vessel distance estimation, bridging the gap between experimental research and real-world deployment.

We demonstrate an integrated photonic circuit based on feed forward photonic meshes that can be programmed and reconfigured to perform arbitrary spectral filter functions. We investigate a subset of the available filter functions, demonstrating that a N = 4 input triangular mesh with M = 3 layers may be operated via self-configuration algorithms to filter M arbitrary wavelengths from a given input spectrum. The tunable nature of the architecture enables preconfigured filter functions to be swept in the spectral domain continuously over the free spectral range of the device. This removes any strict requirements between the design parameters of the architecture and the center wavelength of a desired filter function. With this architecture, we experimentally demonstrate arbitrary wavelength rejection filters with contrasts as deep as 40 dB. Further, by intentionally selecting the center wavelengths of each filter function to lie along a wavelength grid we demonstrate deep wavelength division demultiplexing (DWDM) with inter-channel crosstalk between -25 dB and -40 dB. Unlike typical DWDM systems, in this architecture the center wavelength of each channel is not fixed at fabrication and instead may be swept or reordered arbitrarily. This device demonstrates advantages over typical methods for DWDM, Raman spectroscopy, and correlation spectroscopy as well as other applications.

The interaction of crack fronts with asperities is central to the criteria of fracture in heterogeneous materials and for predicting fracture surface formation. It is known how dynamic crack fronts respond to small, 1st-order, perturbations. However, large and localized disturbances to crack motion induce dynamic and geometric nonlinear effects beyond the existing linear theories. Because the determination of the 3D elastic fields surrounding perturbed crack fronts is a necessary step towards any theoretical study of crack front dynamics, we develop a 2nd-order perturbation theory for the asymptotic fields of planar crack fronts. Based on previous work, we consider two models of fracture. In the so-called scalar elastic model, which is analogous to anti-plane (Mode III) fracture, the stress and displacement fields are obtained through matched asymptotic expansions. A self-consistent expansion is used to resolve the fields near tensile (Mode I) crack fronts. Both methods can be extended to higher perturbation orders. The main results of this work are the explicit 2nd-order expressions of the local dynamic energy-release-rates for perturbations of straight fronts. These general formulae recover the known energy-release-rates of curved quasi-static fronts and of straight dynamic fronts.

The dynamics and statistical properties of two-dimensional (2D) turbulence are often investigated through numerical simulations of incompressible, viscous fluids in doubly periodic domains. A key challenge in 2D turbulence research is accurately identifying and describing statistical properties of its coherent vortex structures within complex flow patterns. This paper addresses this challenge by providing a classification theory for the topological structure of particle orbits generated by instantaneous Hamiltonian flows on the torus $\mathbb{T}^2$, which serves as a mathematical model for 2D incompressible flows. Based on this theory, we show that the global orbit structure of any Hamiltonian flow can be converted into a planar tree, named a partially Cyclically-Ordered rooted Tree (COT), and its corresponding string expression (COT representation). We apply this conversion algorithm to 2D energy and enstrophy cascade turbulence. The results show that the complex topological structure of turbulent flow patterns can be effectively represented by simple trees and sequences of letters, thereby successfully extracting coherent vortex structures and investigating their statistical properties from a topological perspective.

Hybrid Two-Stage Reconstruction of Multiscale Subsurface Flow with Physics-informed Residual Connected Neural Operator

Machine Learning (cs.LG); Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
The novel neural networks show great potential in solving partial differential equations. For single-phase flow problems in subsurface porous media with high-contrast coefficients, the key is to develop neural operators with accurate reconstruction capability and strict adherence to physical laws. In this study, we proposed a hybrid two-stage framework that uses multiscale basis functions and physics-guided deep learning to solve the Darcy flow problem in high-contrast fractured porous media. In the first stage, a data-driven model is used to reconstruct the multiscale basis function based on the permeability field to achieve effective dimensionality reduction while preserving the necessary multiscale features. In the second stage, the physics-informed neural network, together with Transformer-based global information extractor is used to reconstruct the pressure field by integrating the physical constraints derived from the Darcy equation, ensuring consistency with the physical laws of the real world. The model was evaluated on datasets with different combinations of permeability and basis functions and performed well in terms of reconstruction accuracy. Specifically, the framework achieves R2 values above 0.9 in terms of basis function fitting and pressure reconstruction, and the residual indicator is on the order of $1\times 10^{-4}$. These results validate the ability of the proposed framework to achieve accurate reconstruction while maintaining physical consistency.

The Axelrod approximation is widely used in astrophysical modelling codes to evaluate electron-impact excitation effective collision strengths for forbidden transitions. Approximate methods such as this are a necessity for many heavy elements with open shells where collisional data is either non existent or sparse as the use of more robust methods prove prohibitively expensive. Atomic data for such forbidden transitions are essential for producing full collisional radiative models that do not assume Local-Thermodynamic-Equilibrium (LTE). In this short work we repeat the optimization of the simple Axelrod formula for a large number of $R$-matrix data sets, ranging from Fe and Ni to the first r-process peak elements of Sr, Y and Zr, to higher Z systems Te, W, Pt and Au. We show that the approximate treatment of forbidden transitions can be a significant source of inaccuracy in such collisional radiative models. We find a large variance of the optimized coefficients for differing systems and charge states, although some general trends can be seen based on the orbital structure of the ground-state-configurations. These trends could potentially inform better estimates for future calculations for elements where $R$-matrix data is not available.

In a consistent description of the quantum measurement process, whether the wave or particle-like aspect of a system is revealed depends on the details of the measurement chain, and cannot be interpreted as an objective fact about the system independent of the measurement. We show precisely how this comes to be in the measurement of gravitational radiation. Whether a wave or particle-like aspect is revealed is a property of the detector employed at the end of the quantum measurement chain, rather than of the meter, such as a gravitational-wave (GW) antenna or resonant bar, used to couple the radiation to the detector. A linear detector yields no signal for radiation in a Fock state and a signal proportional to the amplitude in a coherent state -- supporting a wave-like interpretation. By contrast, the signal from a detector coupled to the meter's energy is non-zero only when the incident radiation contains at least a single graviton. Thus, conceptually simple modifications of contemporary GW antennae can reveal wave-particle duality in the measurement of gravitational radiation.

Identifying causal relationships in climate systems remains challenging due to nonlinear, coupled dynamics that limit the effectiveness of linear and stochastic causal discovery approaches. This study benchmarks Convergence Cross Mapping (CCM) against Granger causality, PCMCI, and VarLiNGAM using both synthetic datasets with ground truth causal links and 41 years of Arctic climate data (1979--2021). Unlike stochastic models that rely on autoregressive residual dependence, CCM leverages Takens' state-space reconstruction and delay-embedding to reconstruct attractor manifolds from time series. Cross mapping between reconstructed manifolds exploits deterministic signatures of causation, enabling the detection of weak and bidirectional causal links that linear models fail to resolve. Results demonstrate that CCM achieves higher specificity and fewer false positives on synthetic benchmarks, while maintaining robustness under observational noise and limited sample lengths. On Arctic data, CCM reveals significant causal interactions between sea ice extent and atmospheric variables like specific humidity, longwave radiation, and surface temperature with a $p$-value of $0.009$, supporting ice-albedo feedbacks and moisture-radiation couplings central to Arctic amplification. In contrast, stochastic approaches miss these nonlinear dependencies or infer spurious causal relations. This work establishes CCM as a robust causal inference tool for nonlinear climate dynamics and provides the first systematic benchmarking framework for method selection in climate research.

The arrow of time problem remains one of the most intriguing questions of modern physics. We investigate one particular example of this problem: the irreversibility of heat transfer through an interface between two materials. This special case turned out to be much simpler than that of transport phenomena in bulk materials. We start by exploring a mechanism that turns equations of reversible, unitary transmission of wave-particles through the interface into irreversible equations, describing the distribution functions at the interface. This mechanism, non-coherence, is treated in an analogy with wave optics: no real waves are absolutely monochromatic and thus have finite temporal coherence. We find an experimental setup to prove the suggested mechanism and calculate the optimal parameters to observe the phenomenon. We conduct an experiment whose results fully agree with the predictions of our theory. In the final discussion, we revisit the connection with heat transport through a material interface and show that only the suggested mechanism can explain the irreversibility of interfacial transport.

Quantum computing promises to revolutionize many-body simulations for quantum chemistry, but its potential is constrained by limited qubits and noise in current devices. In this work, we introduce the Lossy Quantum Selected Configuration Interaction (Lossy-QSCI) framework, which combines a lossy subspace Hamiltonian preparation pipeline with a generic QSCI selection process. This framework integrates a chemistry-inspired lossy Random Linear Encoder (Chemical-RLE) with a neural network-assisted Fermionic Expectation Decoder (NN-FED). The RLE leverages fermionic number conservation to compress quantum states, reducing qubit requirements to O(N log M) for M spin orbitals and N electrons, while preserving crucial ground state information and enabling self-consistent configuration recovery. NN-FED, powered by a neural network trained with minimal data, efficiently decodes these compressed states, overcoming the measurement challenges common in the approaches of the traditional QSCI and its variants. Through iterative quantum sampling and classical post-processing, our hybrid method refines ground state estimates with high efficiency. This framework offers a resource-efficient pathway for ground-state simulations on near-term noisy hardware and could inspire resource-efficient extensions to future devices by minimizing qubit overhead.

Title:
Universal dissipators for driven open quantum systems and the correction to linear response

We investigate in parallel two common pictures used to describe quantum systems interacting with their surrounding environment, i.e., the stochastic Hamiltonian description, where the environment is implicitly included in the fluctuating internal parameters of the system, and the explicit inclusion of the environment via the time-convolutionless projection operator method. Utilizing these two different frameworks, we show that the dissipator characterizing the dynamics of the reduced system, determined up to second order in the noise strength or bath-system coupling, is composed of two parts. One is universal, meaning that it keeps the same form regardless of the drive term. This form constitutes the relevant part of the dissipator only as long as the drive is weak. We thoroughly discuss the assumptions on which this treatment is based and its limitations. Then, by considering the first non-vanishing higher-order term in our expansion, we derive the other, drive-dependent, term completing the full dissipator. This part of the dissipator, originating from the third cumulant, is usually neglected when modeling the decoherent dynamics of controlled qubits. However, this further term constitutes the linear response correction due to memory-mediated environmental effects in driven-dissipative quantum systems. Also, it notably shows that the structure of our quantum master equation goes beyond the Lindblad form. The Lindblad form is recovered for memory-less baths. Finally, we demonstrate this technique to be highly accurate for the problems of dephasing in a driven qubit and for the theory of pseudo-modes for quantum environments.

The magnetic fields and dynamical processes in the solar polar regions play a crucial role in the solar magnetic cycle and in supplying mass and energy to the fast solar wind, ultimately being vital in controlling solar activities and driving space weather. Despite numerous efforts to explore these regions, to date no imaging observations of the Sun's poles have been achieved from vantage points out of the ecliptic plane, leaving their behavior and evolution poorly understood. This observation gap has left three top-level scientific questions unanswered, 1) How does the solar dynamo work and drive the solar magnetic cycle? 2) What drives the fast solar wind? 3) How do space weather processes globally originate from the Sun and propagate throughout the solar system? The Solar Polar-orbit Observatory (SPO) mission, a solar polar exploration spacecraft, is proposed to address these three unanswered scientific questions by imaging the Sun's poles from high heliolatitudes. In order to achieve its scientific goals, SPO will carry six remote-sensing and four in-situ instruments to measure the vector magnetic fields and Doppler velocity fields in the photosphere, to observed the Sun in the extreme ultraviolet, X-ray, and radio wavelengths, to image the corona and the heliosphere up to 45 $R_\odot$, and to perform in-situ detection of magnetic fields, and low- and high-energy particles in the solar wind.

This work reinterprets so-called 'noise' in cosmic ray imaging, indicating that the data of reconstructed Points of Closest Approach (PoCA points) outside the volume of interest defined by traditional tomography methods contain valuable physical information that has been traditionally disregarded. Through analysis of data from the detection system of four resistive plate chambers (RPCs) and Monte Carlo simulations employing energy deposition weighting for coordinate determination, we confirm that these points physically originate from the interaction between muons and the material above the detection system, particularly the roof, resulting in the production of secondary particles. The research yields two principal findings: first, in the four-layer compliance measurement system, the position recording of the first layer can be from secondary particles generated by cosmic rays, while the records from the three layers below represent the actual trajectories of cosmic rays; second, the roof structure significantly impacts the distribution of PoCA points at detector positions, where quantitative analysis demonstrates a strong correlation between roof thickness and the number of reconstructed PoCA points -- a relationship that can be precisely measured through $z$-coordinate distribution analysis in specific intervals. Due to the varying performances of different roofing materials in this analytical method, this approach holds significant potential for development into a new tomography technique.

Conformal prediction is a distribution-free and model-agnostic uncertainty-quantification method that provides finite-sample prediction intervals with guaranteed coverage. In this work, for the first time, we apply conformal-prediction to generate uncertainty bands for physical observables in nuclear physics, such as the total cross section and nucleon-nucleon phase shifts. We demonstrate the method's flexibility by considering three scenarios: (i) a pointwise model, where expansion coefficients in chiral effective field theory are treated as random variables; (ii) a Gaussian-Process model for the coefficients; and (iii) phase shifts at various energies and partial waves calculated using local interactions from chiral effective field theory. In each case, conformal-prediction intervals are constructed and validated empirically. Our results show that conformal prediction provides reliable and adaptive uncertainty bands even in the presence of non-Gaussian behavior, such as skewness and heavy tails. These findings highlight conformal prediction as a robust and practical framework for quantifying theoretical uncertainties.

We propose an O(100)m Atom Interferometer (AI) experiment - AICE - to be installed against a wall of the PX46 access shaft to the LHC. This experiment would probe unexplored ranges of the possible couplings of bosonic ultralight dark matter (ULDM) to atomic constituents and undertake a pioneering search for gravitational waves (GWs) at frequencies intermediate between those to which existing and planned experiments are sensitive, among other fundamental physics studies. A conceptual feasibility study showed that this AI experiment could be isolated from the LHC by installing a shielding wall in the TX46 gallery, and surveyed issues related to the proximity of the LHC machine, finding no technical obstacles. A detailed technical implementation study has shown that the preparatory civil-engineering work, installation of bespoke radiation shielding, deployment of access-control systems and safety alarms, and installation of an elevator platform could be carried out during LS3, allowing installation and operation of the AICE detector to proceed during Run 4 without impacting HL-LHC operation. These studies have established that PX46 is a uniquely promising location for an AI experiment. We foresee that, if the CERN management encourages this Letter of Intent, a significant fraction of the Terrestrial Very Long Baseline Atom Interferometer (TVLBAI) Proto-Collaboration may wish to contribute to AICE.
