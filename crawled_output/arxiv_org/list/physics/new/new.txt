Title:
Accelerating Mirrors as a Physical Realization of the Kappa Plane-Wave Vacuum
Arash Azizi

Subjects:
General Physics (physics.gen-ph)
The kappa plane-wave vacuum is a family of kinematically defined quantum states whose thermal properties are well-understood, but whose physical origin has remained an open question. In this paper, we provide a concrete dynamical realization for this vacuum, demonstrating that it is physically and operationally equivalent to the quantum state produced by an accelerating Carlitz-Willey (CW) mirror on future null infinity. The equivalence is established through a three-pronged proof, showing that both systems exhibit identical Bogoliubov squeeze parameters, identical non-local thermal kernels in their Wightman functions, and identical Planckian responses in an Unruh-DeWitt detector. This result grounds an abstract kinematic construction in a well-understood dynamical model, identifying the parameter $\kappa$ with the mirror's physical acceleration. We further generalize our findings by deriving the complete class of mirror trajectories that reproduce the same asymptotic thermal state and show that only the pure exponential CW trajectory generates a constant, stationary flux.

Light-induced nonlinear Edelstein effect under ferroaxial ordering

Optics (physics.optics); Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)
Ferroaxial ordering, a spontaneous rotational distortion of the atomic arrangement, brings about a cross-product-type spin--orbit coupling (SOC) manifested as an electric toroidal dipole. We propose the light-induced nonlinear Edelstein effect (NLEE) -- a second-order optical response in which a static magnetization is induced by a time-dependent electric field -- as a promising probe of ferroaxial ordering. First, we elucidate the relationship between the NLEE tensor and the electric toroidal dipole. By decomposing the polarization modes of light, we find that both the linearly polarized and circularly polarized light couple to the electric toroidal dipole via distinct mechanisms. We then demonstrate the NLEE using a minimal model that incorporates ferroaxial ordering. Our analysis reveals that effective coupling between orbital magnetization and SOC induces spin magnetization. In particular, the spin magnetization is tilted owing to the electric toroidal dipole; the tilt angle reflects the ratio between the ferroaxial-origin SOC and the relativistic SOC.

General Physics (physics.gen-ph)
The thermodynamic principle of superfluid flow -- that the energy is minimized at constant entropy -- is applied to superconducting currents to derive the Meissner-Ochsenfeld effect in which magnetic fields are expelled from superconductors. The principle gives a modified form for the first London equation that does not trap magnetic fields within a superconductor. The physical mechanism by which a critical magnetic field destroys superconductivity is identified.

Density scaling laws complement traditional population scaling laws by enabling the analysis of the full range of human settlements and revealing rural-to-urban transitions with breakpoints at consistent population densities. However, previous studies have been constrained by the granularity of rural and urban units, as well as limitations in the quantity and diversity of indicators. This study addresses these gaps by examining Middle Layer Super Output Areas (MSOAs) in England and Wales, incorporating an extensive set of 117 indicators for the year 2021, spanning age, ethnicity, educational attainment, religion, disability, economic activity, mortality, crime, property transactions, and road accidents. Results indicate that the relationship between indicator density and population density is best described by a segmented power-law model with a consistent breakpoint (33 +- 5 persons per hectare) for 92 of the 117 indicators. Additionally, increasing granularity reveals further rural-to-urban transitions not observed at coarser spatial resolutions. Our findings also highlight the influence of population characteristics on scaling exponents, where stratifying dementia and ischaemic heart disease by older age groups (aged 70 and above) significantly affects these exponents, illustrating a protective urban effect.

Title:
Towards a European Quantum Act: A Two-Pillar Framework for Regulation and Innovation
Mauritz Kop

Quantum technologies promise transformative advancements but pose significant dual-use risks. Realizing their potential while mitigating risks necessitates a robust, anticipatory, and harmonized EU regulatory framework, grounded in the precautionary principle. Such a framework must be sui generis, as foundational quantum mechanical phenomena -incl. superposition, entanglement, and tunneling -defy the intuitive classical assumptions of factual certainty, causality, and locality that underpin existing legal paradigms, demanding a bespoke regulatory architecture that contributes to the emerging lex specialis for quantum information technologies. Responding to the Quantum Europe Strategy, this contribution outlines the rationale for a dedicated European Quantum Act. Drawing lessons from legislative strategies in the semiconductor (EU/US Chips Acts) and AI (EU AI Act) domains, and analyzing US and Chinese technology policy, we argue the EU needs a 'full-stack' industrial policy. We propose the EU Quantum Act should be a two-pillar instrument, combining New Legislative Framework-style regulation with an ambitious Chips Act-style industrial and security policy. This dual approach fosters innovation through strategic investment (e.g. via a DARPA-style agency) while managing risk through clear, risk-based tiers and regulatory sandboxes. This strategy is presented as essential for EU technological sovereignty and for building a strong transatlantic tech alliance. On the international stage, we advocate for a global non-proliferation framework for quantum and AI wmd's inspired by the IAEA/NPT model and overseen by an 'International Quantum Agency'. This vision culminates in the 'Qubits for Peace' initiative, a global governance structure to ensure quantum technologies are developed safely and ethically. The article concludes by consolidating the analysis into a detailed legislative blueprint.

Title:
Two-Photon Emission from an Accelerated Detector with Gaussian Switching
Arash Azizi

13 pages, 4 figures, 3 appendices
Subjects:
General Physics (physics.gen-ph)
We present a closed-form analysis of second-order two-photon emission from a uniformly accelerated Unruh-DeWitt detector with a smooth Gaussian switch and derivative coupling. The time-ordered Dyson integrals are evaluated exactly, yielding a single spectral amplitude that simultaneously covers all four channels--right-travelling/right-travelling (RR), left-travelling/left-travelling (LL), right-travelling/left-travelling (RL), and left-travelling/right-travelling (LR). The spectra are organized by narrow kinematic gates (sum-frequency for RR/LL, difference-frequency for RL/LR) and a causal resonant denominator encoded by the Faddeeva function. As the gate time increases, the Gaussian factors sharpen into delta constraints and recover the eternal-interaction response. We map scaling with acceleration, gap, and duration, and show that the single-particle marginal combines a sharp nonthermal resonance with an Unruh thermal tail.

Energy and momentum in Newtonian mechanics have the familiar relations, ($\mathrm{E}=mv^2/2$) and ($\mathbf{P}=m\mathbf{v}$), derived from the non-relativistic limit of special relativity. In this study, we find the corresponding relations to formulate the so-called ``post-Carrollian mechanics'' by applying the ultra-relativistic limit to tachyon theory, resulting in ($\mathrm{E}={m\,c^{\,3}}/{v}$) and ($\mathbf{P}=\mathbf{\hat{v}}\,{m\,c^{\,3}}/{2\,v^{\,2}}$). Using these, we determine the energy-momentum relation and investigate the thermodynamics of an ideal gas composed of post-Carroll particles. Moreover, by applying the ultra-relativistic limit to Einstein's equations coupled to tachyon dust, we find the post-Carrollian gravitational potential. Finally, utilizing the geodesic equation, we determine the post-Carrollian gravitational field, which unlike the Newtonian case is found to be radially outward.

Title:
Bayesian Parameter Inference and Uncertainty-Informed Sensitivity Analysis in a 0D Cardiovascular Model for Intraoperative Hypotension

Subjects:
Medical Physics (physics.med-ph)
Computational cardiovascular models are promising tools for clinical decision support, particularly in complex conditions, such as intraoperative hypotension (IOH). IOH arises from different mechanisms, making treatment selection non-trivial. Patient-specific predictions require calibration, typically performed using deterministic approaches prone to parameter non-identifiability and lacking uncertainty quantification, hindering clinical translation. Consequently, Bayesian approaches are needed that facilitate parameter inference, sensitivity analysis, and uncertainty quantification in cardiovascular models.
We utilize Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to estimate parameter distributions of a cardiovascular lumped parameter model (LPM) across different IOH scenarios. We demonstrate parameter non-uniqueness and its impact on sensitivity indices. We improve parameter reliability by incorporating clinical knowledge and measurement uncertainties. We enable continual learning of the model using sequential parameter updating as new patient data become available. We introduce an uncertainty-aware sensitivity analysis and compare it with a deterministic approach.
Deterministic calibration yielded many local solutions for IOH, with notably different sensitivities. MCMC distinguished different hypotension scenarios, such as those induced by impaired contractility or hypovolemia. Propagating uncertainties from MCMC through sensitivity analysis provided tighter credible intervals, resulting in more stable parameter rankings than the deterministic approach. The Bayesian approach revealed differences in model behavior and treatment suggestions across patient conditions.
Combining Bayesian inference with sequential updating and sensitivity analysis improves the reliability and identifiability of parameter estimates, enhancing the clinical utility of LPMs for therapy guidance.

Public outreach in quantum science and technologies has many goals, ranging from generating interest and dampening hype to making the fascinating and complex topic more accessible. In this work, we present a play on quantum science and technologies aimed at a science-curious audience, which aims to lift the curtains on different researchers' perspectives on this rapidly evolving field. These notes expand on the ideas presented in the play and provide additional sources that may be useful for educators and directors in future productions.
In "A Quantum of Hope", the end of the world has never looked so bureaucratic. When an alien civilization announces that Earth will be demolished to make way for a research station, humanity is given five years to prove its value. The evaluation criteria? Randomly chosen to be quantum science and technologies. Five experts, sampled from quantum academia and industry, are locked in a room to select a single project proposal to unite global efforts. Douglas Adams meets 12 Angry Men in a galactic-grade grant review committee, where scientific ideas, moral convictions, and unruly egos clash.

Light-matter interactions in chiral cavities offer a compelling route to manipulate material properties by breaking fundamental symmetries such as time-reversal symmetry. However, only a limited number of chiral cavity implementations exhibiting broken time-reversal symmetry have been demonstrated to date. These typically rely on either the application of strong magnetic fields, circularly polarized Floquet driving, or the hybridization of cavity modes with matter excitations in the ultrastrong coupling regime. Here, we present a one-dimensional terahertz photonic-crystal cavity that exhibits broken time-reversal symmetry. The cavity consists of a high-resistivity silicon wafer sandwiched between lightly n-doped InSb wafers. By exploiting the nonreciprocal response of a terahertz magnetoplasma and the exceptionally low effective mass of electrons in InSb, we demonstrate a circularly polarized cavity mode at 0.67 THz under a modest magnetic field of 0.3 T, with a quality factor exceeding 50. Temperature-, magnetic field-, and polarization-dependent measurements, supported by simulations, confirm the realization of a chiral cavity with broken time-reversal symmetry. This platform offers a robust and accessible approach for exploring chiral light--matter interactions and vacuum dressed quantum condensed matter in the terahertz regime.

Booster Cavity Damper Redesign for PIP-II

Accelerator Physics (physics.acc-ph)
A new Higher Order Mode (HOM) damper was designed and tested for the Booster accelerator cavity at Fermilab. In anticipation of the PIP-II upgrade, it was discovered that the higher beam intensity of PIP-II may cause beam instability due to an excited mode at 105 MHz. This unfortunately corresponds with the cavity's 2nd order harmonic mode, which will sweep from 86-105.7 MHz. The new damper is a modification of an existing damper that was designed to reduce an existing static HOM at 83 MHz, with the new design intending to cover the 2nd order HOM as well. The existing damper uses an inductive coupling loop to extract RF energy from the cavity which then goes through a filter in order to reflect the fundamental frequency back into the cavity while passing HOMs to a dump load. The new damper intends to replace the filter portion of the system with a wider band variant while also changing the topology from a coaxial cable loop filter to a componentized PCB-based design. Primary design challenges include bandwidth coverage, impedance matching of the various modes, long term thermal and mechanical stability, radiation hardness, and high voltage handling. Initial designs achieved the desired damping but were found to quickly succumb to destructive arcing due to the voltages present. More finalized designs intend to address this problem through circuit redesigns and the use of hardier components.

Terahertz amplification by injection locking of waveguide resonant tunneling diode

Optics (physics.optics); Applied Physics (physics.app-ph)
High power and low phase noise oscillators at terahertz frequencies are required for several burgeoning scientific and technological applications, including radioastronomy, imaging, molecular spectroscopy, radar, and wireless communications. Operating at terahertz oscillation frequencies presents unique challenges based on the method of generation. Electronic oscillators can produce ample power but suffer from relatively high phase noise due to the nonlinear multiplication of microwave sources. Meanwhile, photomixing of optical sources provides superior spectral purity but low usable power, due to the limited bandwidth of the photomixer. We propose a hybrid solution involving injection locking of an electronic oscillator, a resonant tunneling diode, by a low phase noise photomixed source, a dual-wavelength Brillouin laser. In this study, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept injection-locking amplifier at 260 GHz, achieving up to 40 dB gain for nanowatt-level input signals. For the first time, we characterize the residual phase noise of an injection-locked waveguide RTD, showing quantitative consistency with theoretical predictions based on detailed analysis of its free-running noise. This architecture has the potential to scale to frequencies of 1 THz and beyond, which would provide a clear path to realize a terahertz oscillator with high power and low phase noise.

Characterization of Gradient Index Fibers

Subjects:
Optics (physics.optics)
Gradient index (GRIN) fibers are used to improve the design of many fiber optic devices. However, the properties of the GRIN fiber must be determined to optimally engineer a device which incorporates GRIN fiber components. The index of refraction of most GRIN fibers varies quadratically in the radial direction, where the quadratic coefficient is characterized by the gradient index constant $g$. We measured $g$ for Thorlabs GIF50C GRIN fiber at both $780~\mathrm{nm}$ and $1550~\mathrm{nm}$ using equipment which is commonly available in an optics laboratory. This measurement was achieve by profiling the beam exiting various lengths of GRIN fiber. A custom-built beam profiler was used, which enabled the beam position to be referenced with respect to the facet of the GRIN fiber. We report a gradient index constant of $0.0057~\mathrm{\mu m}^{-1} \pm 0.0001~\mathrm{\mu m}^{-1}$ at $780~\mathrm{nm}$ and $0.0055~\mathrm{\mu m}^{-1} \pm 0.0001~\mathrm{\mu m}^{-1}$ at $1550~\mathrm{nm}$. These results are in close agreement with previously reported gradient index constant measurements made for different wavelengths.

Electron Inertia and Magnetic Reconnection
Allen H Boozer
Subjects:
Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
The finite electron mass can cause magnetic reconnection even in the absence of any other non-ideal effect in a magnetic evolution. It will be shown that when electron inertia is the only non-ideal effect in the evolution of the magnetic field $\vec{B}$, there is a related field that evolves ideally. This field is $\vec{\mathcal{B}} \equiv \vec{B} + \vec{\nabla}\times \left( (m_e/n e^2) \vec{j} \right)$ with $m_e$ the electron mass, $n$ the electron number density, and $\vec{j}$ the current density. Although the magnetic field is modified from its ideal evolution form by the electron inertia, the effect on particle trajectories, even electron trajectories, is small unless the current lies in thin sheets, which make $\vec{j}$ extremely large. The field $\vec{\mathcal{B}}$ is closely related to Voigt normalized magnetic field, which is defined by a Laplacian smoothing of $\vec{B}$. The difference between $\vec{\mathcal{B}}$ and $\vec{B}$ involves the relativistically invariant four-space Laplacian acting on $\vec{B}$ with a $c/\omega_{pe}$ smoothing distance; $\omega_{pe}$ is the plasma frequency.

We report on the growth optimization of intentionally low-doped ($10^{15}$ $cm^{-3}$) high-quality $\beta-Ga_2O_3$ drift layers up to 10 $\mu m$ thick via MOCVD and the fabrication of kilovolt-class field plated Schottky barrier diodes on these thick drift layers. Homoepitaxial growth was performed on (010) $10^{15}$ $cm^{-3}$ substrates using TMGa as the Ga precursor. Growth parameters were systematically optimized to determine the best conditions for high quality thick growths with the given reactor geometry. Chamber pressure was found to improve the growth rate, mobility, and roughness of the samples. Growth rates of up to 7.2 $\mu m$/hr., thicknesses of up to 10 $\mu m$, Hall mobilities of up to 176 $cm^2$/Vs, RMS roughness down to 5.45 nm, UID concentrations as low as $2 \times$ $10^{15}$ $cm^{-3}$, and controllable intentional doping down to $3 \times$ $10^{15}$ $cm^{-3}$ were achieved. Field plated Schottky barrier diodes (FP-SBDs) were fabricated on a $6.5 \times$ $10^{15}$ $cm^{-3}$ intentionally doped 10 $\mu m$ thick film to determine the electrical performance of the MOCVD-grown material. The FP-SBD was found to have current density $>$100 A/$cm^2$ at 3 V forward bias with a specific differential on resistance ($R_{on,sp}$) of 16.22 m$\Omega$.$cm^2$ and a turn on voltage of 1 V. The diodes were found to have high quality anode metal/semiconductor interfaces with an ideality factor of 1.04, close to unity. Diodes had a maximum breakdown voltage of 1.50 kV, leading to a punch-through maximum field of 2.04 MV/cm under the anode metal, which is a state-of-the-art result for SBDs on MOCVD-grown (010) drift layers.

Impacts of Blade Camber on Cross-Flow Turbine Performance and Loading

Subjects:
Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
Cross-flow turbines show promise for renewable energy generation from wind and tidal sources. The rotating reference frame of cross-flow turbine blades results in virtual camber and incidence due to streamline curvature, altering the lift, drag and pitching moment of the blades. Adding geometric camber is therefore likely to alter performance and loading, however there is little consensus regarding the direction of camber that might be most favorable. This study compares 2% concave-in and concave-out cambered blades (NACA 2418) with symmetrical NACA 0018 foils for a turbine with a 0.49 chord-to-radius ratio. Experimental performance measurements are compared across a range of tip-speeds, and particle image velocimetry is used to explore the in-rotor flow evolution through the cycle. Concave-out blades, which enhance virtual camber and lift in the power stroke are found to exhibit sub-optimal performance. In contrast, concave-in cambered blades slightly improved symmetrical blade performance by enhancing downstream flow reattachment, more than compensating for reduced peak power generation. The difference between each cambered foil is seen to grow with increasing tip-speed ratio. Moreover, these concave-in blades reduce peak loading by 13%, which may prove critical in future designs, especially at high tip-speed ratios. Exploration of the near-blade flow fields suggest that the influence of geometric camber is non-linear, and that use of a simplistic summation of both geometric and virtual camber to account for camber effects may be overly simplistic. Despite this, corresponding validated simulations suggest that a small but positive total camber (geometric plus virtual) is optimal for this turbine.

Pyrene-functionalized materials are extensively employed in photoluminescent applications, owing to their extended pi-conjugation and favorable photophysical properties. However, their luminescent performance is often attenuated by pi-pi stacking-driven excimer formation and molecular oxygen quenching. To mitigate these undesirable effects, a novel class of 7-tert-butylpyren-2-ol derivatives with extended 'arm-like' substituents at the 1,3-positions have been synthesized and their luminescent properties in solution have been thoroughly investigated. While the 2- and 7-positions of the pyrene core are frequently modified with hydroxyl and tert-butyl groups, this work presents the first introduction of 'arm-like' substituents at the 1,3-positions. The stretched-out 'arm-like' substituents not only introduce steric bulk to suppress excimer formation but also change the symmetry class of pyrene and modulate electron density at its 1,2,3,7-positions. These effects tune pyrene's energy levels, demonstrating moderate (0.4) to high (0.7) fluorescence quantum yields and shorter-lived fluorescence lifetimes ranging from ca. 20 to 40 ns. These shorter lifetimes lead to a reduction of the pyrene derivatives' susceptibility to energy scavenging by molecular oxygen. In addition, the specific form of the 'arms' are important. Alkyl-containing arms and alkenyl-containing arms exhibit different decay pathways, which is reflected by their disparate nonradiative rates. Thus, the introduction of 'arm-like' modifications represents a promising approach to modulate the photophysical behaviours of annulenes, highlighting their applicability in next-generation electronic and optoelectronic systems.

Medium temperature (mid-T) baking, typically conducted at 300 350 C, enhances the quality factor of niobium (Nb) superconducting radio frequency cavities. High vacuum furnace baking is commonly preferred for its practicality in large-scale processing. However, surface contamination, such as niobium carbide formed during vacuum furnace baking, can limit the quench field and degrade the quality factor of the cavity. To investigate this effect, a 1.3 GHz single-cell Nb cavity underwent mid-T baking, followed by a chemical treatment to remove the surface contaminants. Post-treatment measurements revealed a significant improvement in both the quality factor and the quench field.

From genomes and ecosystems to bureaucracies and cities, the growth of complex systems occurs by adding new types of functions and expanding existing ones. We present a simple generative model that generalizes the Yule-Simon process by including: (i) a size-dependent probability of introducing new functions, and (ii) a generalized preferential attachment mechanism for expanding existing ones. We uncover a shared underlying structure that helps explain how function diversity evolves in empirical observations, such as prokaryotic proteomes, U.S. federal agencies, and urban economies. We show that real systems are often best represented as having non-Zipfian rank-frequency distributions, driven by sublinear preferential attachment, whilst still maintaining power-law scaling in their abundance distributions. Furthermore, our analytics explain five distinct phases of the organization of functional elements across complex systems. The model integrates empirical findings regarding the logarithmic growth of diversity in cities and the self-similarity of their rank-frequency distributions. Self-similarity previously observed in the rank-frequency distributions of cities is not observed in cells and federal agencies -- however, under a rescaling relative to the total diversity, all systems admit self-similar structures predicted by our theory.

This study examines the combined impact of the chord-to-radius ratio (c/R), blade camber, and preset pitch on cross-flow turbine performance. While prior research has examined individual effects of c/R and pitch, this work focuses on their interaction with camber and the resulting aerodynamic behaviors. Central to the analysis is the concept of virtual camber and virtual incidence, which arise from the curved trajectory of the blades, and are quantified using a conformal transformation. Using two experimental datasets -- one varying preset pitch, c/R, blade count, and Reynolds number, and the other examining geometric blade camber and pitch under identical conditions -- this work demonstrates links between blade pitch and camber influences. We propose a potential pathway for reducing the design space by combining geometric variables and coupled virtual effects into two effective parameters: net camber and net incidence. These composite variables provide a more unified and descriptive framework for understanding turbine performance and design behavior, offering a pathway for more consistent optimization of turbine geometry.

First-Principles Prediction of Material Properties from Topological Invariants
Sebastián Alí Sacasa-Céspedes
Subjects:
General Physics (physics.gen-ph)
Methods for predicting material properties often rely on empirical models or approximations that overlook the fundamental topological nature of quantum interactions. We introduce a topological framework based on string theory and graph geometry that resolves ultraviolet divergences as topological obstructions regularized via Calabi-Yau mappings while preserving symmetries and causal structures, where molecular and condensed matter systems are represented combinatorially through a graph where M-branes form vertices and open strings are twistor-valued edges, holomorphically encoding geometric data from the dynamical system. The resulting effective action is governed by a graph Laplacian whose spectrum dictates stability, excitations, and phase transitions. Applied to uniaxial nematic liquid crystals, the model not only recovers the phenomenological virtual volumes of the Jiron-Castellon model from first principles but also predicts anisotropic thermal expansion coefficients and refractive indices with precision exceeding 0.06\%. The quantitative agreement with experiment, achieved without fitted parameters, demonstrates that principles from quantum gravity and string theory can directly yield accurate predictions for complex materials.

Tuning Molecular Motors with Tert-Butyl and Fluorinated Tert-Butyl Groups
Ivan Tambovtsev, Hannes Jónsson
Subjects:
Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph)
The effect of modifying substituents in the rotor group of five second generation molecular motors is estimated by theoretical calculations. The rotational speed is estimated by calculating the rate limiting step, the thermal helix inversion, as well as the competing backward transition using harmonic transition state theory with energy and atomic forces obtained from density functional theory. First, a methyl group at the stereogenic center is replaced with a tert-butyl (tBu) group and the rotational speed is found to increase due to reduced lifetime of the metastable state. For two of the rotors, comparison can be made with experimental measurements and the calculated half-life is in close agreement. Secondly, the effect of substituting the nine hydrogen atoms in the tBu group with fluorine atoms is studied and this is found to increase the rotational rate further without significantly altering the molecular structure. The excitation wavelength of both the stable and metastable states is calculated and the separation of the absorption peaks is found to increase by the tBu substitution and even more so by the fluorinated tBu substitution, up to 40 nm. These findings can help develop a strategy for designing molecular motors with a rotational speed that best fits a given application.

On the algebraic stretching dynamics of variable-density mixing in shock-bubble interaction
Xu Han, Bin Yu, Hong Liu
Subjects:
Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
The mixing mechanism within a single-vortex has been a theoretical focus for decades, while remains unclear especially under variable-density (VD) scenario. This study investigates canonical single-vortex VD mixing in shock-bubble interactions (SBI) through high-resolution numerical simulations. Special attention is paid to examine the stretching dynamics and its impact on VD mixing within a single-vortex, and this problem is investigated by quantitatively characterizing the scalar dissipation rate (SDR), namely mixing rate, and its time integral, referred to as mixedness. We first examine single-vortex passive-scalar (PS) mixing with the absence of density difference. Under several assumptions, the single-vortex stretching rate illustrates an algebraic growth of the length of scalar strips. By incorporating diffusion process through the solution of the advection-diffusion equation along these stretched strips, a PS mixing model for SDR is proposed. Within this framework, density-gradient effects from two perspectives of stretching dynamics and diffusion process are discovered to challenge the extension of PS mixing model to VD mixing. First, the secondary baroclinic effect increases the VD stretching rate by the additional secondary baroclinic principal strain. Second, the density source effect suppresses the diffusion process. By accounting for both the secondary baroclinic effect on stretching and the density source effect on diffusion, a VD mixing model for SBI is further modified. This model establishes a quantitative relationship between the stretching dynamics and the evolution of the mixing rate and mixedness for single-vortex VD mixing over a broad range of Mach numbers. Furthermore, the essential role of stretching dynamics on the mixing rate is demonstrated by the derived dependence of the time-averaged mixing rate on the Peclet number Pe.

We report the first characterization results of an optical time-stamping camera based on the Timepix4 chip coupled to a fully depleted optical silicon sensor and fast image intensifier, enabling sub-nanosecond scale, time-resolved imaging for single photons. The system achieves an RMS time resolution of 0.27 ns in direct detection mode without the intensifier and from 0.55 to 1.4 ns in the single-photon regime with intensifier for different amplitude-based signal selections. This shows that Timepix4 provides a significant improvement over previous Timepix3-based cameras in terms of timing precision, pixel count, and data throughput. We analyze key factors that affect performance, including sensor bias and time-walk, and demonstrate effective correction methods to recover high temporal accuracy. The camera temporal resolution, event-driven readout and high rate capability make it a scalable platform for a wide range of applications, including quantum optics, ultrafast imaging, and time-correlated photon counting experiments.

We propose a noninvasive and dispersive framework for estimating the spatially nonuniform conductivity of brain tumors using MR images. The method consists of two components: (i) voxel-wise assignment of tumor conductivity based on reference values fitted to the Cole-Cole model using empirical data from the literature and (ii) fine-tuning of a deep learning model pretrained on healthy participants. A total of 67 cases, comprising both healthy participants and tumor patients and including 9,806 paired T1- and T2-weighted MR images, were used for training and evaluation. The proposed method successfully estimated patient-specific conductivity maps, exhibiting smooth spatial variations that reflected tissue characteristics, such as edema, necrosis, and rim-associated intensity gradients observed in T1- and T2-weighted MR images. At 10 kHz, case-wise mean conductivity values varied across patients, ranging from 0.132 to 0.512 S/m in the rim (defined as the region within 2 mm of the tumor boundary), from 0.132 to 0.608 S/m in the core (the area inside the rim), and from 0.141 to 0.542 S/m in the entire tumor. Electromagnetic simulations for transcranial magnetic stimulation in individualized head models showed substantial differences in intratumoral field distributions between uniform assignments and the proposed nonuniform maps. Furthermore, this framework demonstrated voxel-wise dispersive mapping at 10 kHz, 1 MHz, and 100 MHz. This framework supports accurate whole-brain conductivity estimation by incorporating both individual anatomical structures and tumor-specific characteristics. Collectively, these results advance patient-specific EM modeling for tumor-bearing brains and lay the groundwork for subsequent microwave-band validation.

Neural Earthquake Forecasting with Minimal Information: Limits, Interpretability, and the Role of Markov Structure

Subjects:
Geophysics (physics.geo-ph)
Forecasting earthquake sequences remains a central challenge in seismology, particularly under non-stationary conditions. While deep learning models have shown promise, their ability to generalize across time remains poorly understood. We evaluate neural and hybrid (NN plus Markov) models for short-term earthquake forecasting on a regional catalog using temporally stratified cross-validation. Models are trained on earlier portions of the catalog and evaluated on future unseen events, enabling realistic assessment of temporal generalization. We find that while these models outperform a purely Markovian model on validation data, their test performance degrades substantially in the most recent quintile. A detailed attribution analysis reveals a shift in feature relevance over time, with later data exhibiting simpler, more Markov-consistent behavior. To support interpretability, we apply Integrated Gradients, a type of explainable AI (XAI) to analyze how models rely on different input features. These results highlight the risks of overfitting to early patterns in seismicity and underscore the importance of temporally realistic benchmarks. We conclude that forecasting skill is inherently time-dependent and benefits from combining physical priors with data-driven methods.

Muon tomography is a non-destructive imaging technique that exploits cosmic-ray muons from multiple directions. Its performance critically relies on stable, large-area, and high-resolution position-sensitive detectors. In this work, we report on the development of four compact scintillating fiber modules, each 100 cm long and composed of two staggered layers of 1 mm diameter fibers. The fibres are read out at one end by one-dimensional silicon photomultiplier arrays with a 2 mm pitch, coupled to Citiroc1A-based front-end electronics. The modules were characterised with cosmic-ray muons, yielding a detection efficiency above 97\% and a mean spatial resolution of about 0.56 mm, with uniform response over different distances from the readout end. These results demonstrate the suitability of this detector design for compact and large-area systems in muon tomography applications.

This article discusses electromagnetic properties of volumetric metamaterial samples with essentially discrete structure, that is, assembled as a periodic array of electromagnetic resonators. We develop an efficient numerical procedure for calculating quasi-static electromagnetic response precisely to analyse samples containing several million meta-atoms. We demonstrate that, contrary to a common belief, even million-``atoms'' samples with sharp edges are still quite different from uniform (``homogenised'') materials, and their properties are critically sensitive to their shape and boundary structure. We also compare our results with calculations based on the discrete dipole approximation as well as with an integral model for continuous particles, and analyse distinctions and similarities between the different approaches. In particular, discrete metamaterials present themselves as a stringent platform for assessing continuous models developed for finite objects with sharp edges. Overall, the reported results should be important for understanding mesoscopic systems with strongly interacting elements.

A formulation of the immersed boundary method for incompressible flow over bodies with surface slip described by the Navier boundary condition is presented. In the present method, the wall slip velocity and the boundary force are determined implicitly through a projection to satisfy the boundary conditions and the divergence-free condition of the velocity field as constraints. The present method is first-order accurate in space and fourth-order accurate in time, overcoming the difficulty of the conventional continuous forcing approaches to accurately evaluate the velocity gradient on the boundary. Results from the simulation of the flow past stationary and moving circular cylinders are in good agreement with previous experimental and numerical results for a wide range of slip length on the surface, including the no-slip case.

Gauge symmetry and the arrow of time: How to count what counts

PhD Thesis, University of Groningen. Defended 11 Sept 2025

History and Philosophy of Physics (physics.hist-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
This thesis addresses two major problems in the philosophy of physics. The first is how to identify the minimal physical content of a theory; that is, what features of a theory are truly needed to make predictions, and what can be removed without changing its empirical consequences. The second is the problem of time's arrow: why time seems to have a direction, even though the fundamental laws of physics treat the past and future symmetrically.
I show that answering the first question leads to insights about the second. In particular, I argue that the overall size of the Universe is not used to make predictions in cosmology, and so should not count as part of the theory's minimal physical content. Describing the Universe without this feature leads to a striking result: the arrow of time becomes a local phenomenon. Observers like us who see a Universe full of matter clumped together to form structures like stars and planets are statistically much more likely to see increasing clumpiness into the future than into the past. This tendency helps explain our experience of time's direction.

Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
We present a novel multiscale super-resolution framework (SRLBM) that applies deep learning directly to the mesoscopic density distribution functions of the lattice Boltzmann method for high-fidelity flow reconstruction. Two neural network architectures, a standard convolutional neural network (CNN) and a deeper residual dense network (RDN), are trained to upscale distribution functions from coarse grids by factors of 2, 4 and 8, and then recover velocity, pressure, and vorticity from a single model. For flow past a single cylinder at $\mathrm{Re}=100$, RDN reduces the mean relative error in distribution functions by an order of magnitude compared to CNN and avoids spurious pressure oscillations and vorticity smoothing that affect interpolation and simpler networks. To examine the generalization ability, both models are trained using data from the flow past two cylinders of diameter $d$ at a spanwise distance between the centers of $1.5d$ and a Reynolds number of 200. They are then applied without retraining to wake configurations with distances ranging from $2.0d$ to $3.0d$. In these tests, the mean errors remain essentially unchanged across all distances. However, RDN consistently produces sharper shear-layer roll-ups and secondary eddies. These results demonstrate that super-resolving mesoscopic distribution functions yields richer and more transferable features than operating on macroscopic fields alone. By integrating kinetic theory with deep learning, SRLBM offers a compelling alternative for fluid flow reconstruction, enabling a single model to simultaneously recover multiple high-fidelity flow fields while substantially reducing computational cost.

We study the impact of the carbon steel rebars and the steel TT bridge within the JUNO structure on the shielding effect of the coils. Our simulations demonstrate that despite the presence of carbon steel structures of the rebars of the water pool and the TT bridge within the central detector vicinity, the residual magnetic field experienced by the PMTs remains within the acceptable limit established by the JUNO experiment of 10% for CD-PMTs and 20% for Veto-PMTs, compared to the geomagnetic field. The maximum magnetic fields experienced by the CD-PMTs and Veto-PMTs are 9% and 18% of the geomagnetic field strength, respectively. These findings indicate that the residual magnetic field has minimal impacts on the PMTs detection efficiency.

Characterization of supersonic boundary layers of adiabatic and isothermal curved surfaces with shock interactions

Subjects:
Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
Boundary layers of adiabatic and isothermal curved walls are investigated for a supersonic turbine cascade, including the effects of shock-boundary layer interactions (SBLIs). Wall-resolved large eddy simulations (LES) are performed for a linear cascade of blades with an inlet Mach number of $M_\infty = 2.0$ and Reynolds number based on the axial chord $Re_\infty = 200\,000$. The wall to inlet temperature ratio of the isothermal case is $T_w/T_{\infty}=0.75$, representing a cooled wall. An assessment of the effects of pressure gradient, thermal boundary conditions and SBLIs is presented in terms of the downstream variation of mean flow quantities such as density, temperature, and momentum profiles. The different thermal boundary conditions affect the density and temperature profiles along the boundary layer, where cooling increases the density of the gas near the wall, and reduces its temperature and viscosity. Both of these effects make the momentum profiles fuller and, hence, the boundary layer of the isothermal case is less prone to separate than that of the adiabatic wall. The mean density profiles are also affected by pressure gradients induced by the convex and concave curvatures of the blade, which lead to expansion and compression of the flow, respectively. The analysis of separate terms from the momentum balance equation explains the behavior of various physical mechanisms in the inner and outer regions of the supersonic boundary layers. The importance of mean flow advection, compressibility, and Reynolds stresses is presented in terms of flow acceleration and deceleration. The impact of the SBLIs in the momentum balance mechanisms is also investigated, showing that a combination of compressions and expansions impact the boundary layers by redirecting the flow toward the wall due to the shock formations.

Virtual histology is an emerging field in biomedicine that enables three-dimensional tissue visualization using X-ray micro-computed tomography. However, the method still lacks the specificity of conventional histology, in which parts of the tissue are selectively highlighted using targeted stains. Though some first X-ray stains have been developed to address this issue, their precise location and quantity inside the tissue volume remain largely unknown. In this work, we present a novel approach to virtual histology that simultaneously captures electron number density and X-ray attenuation values through modulation-based X-ray imaging with a structured phase modulator. These complementary measurements enable decomposition of tissue volumes into basis materials, which allows the extraction of three-dimensional maps of molar contrast agent distribution alongside morphological details on the micrometer scale -- here demonstrated on murine kidneys. The concentration values are validated against the established method of K-edge subtraction imaging. We also create a direct bridge from X-ray to visible light imaging by detecting the same stain both using classical histology and our proposed X-ray approach. Our methodology opens new possibilities for biomedical research into disease progression by providing quantitative three-dimensional stain mapping across entire tissue volumes alongside high-contrast morphology, enabling deeper insights into disease mechanisms.

Disordered continuity: Stochastic design of metamaterials towards spatially modulated stiffness

Applied Physics (physics.app-ph)
Natural materials, such as bones and wood, are structured with irregular composites and exhibit smooth distribution of macroscopic physical properties towards desired functionalities including withstanding mechanical forces, energy absorption and modulated deformation. To extend beyond natural synthesis, the design of functional metamaterials requires the solution of two inverse problems, i.e., modulating the spatial distribution of physical properties to achieve target functionalities, and generating geometric structures to realize the desired physical property distribution. Until now, realizing special functionalities from metamaterials primarily relies on the process of joining individual 'building blocks' of functional materials, which are deliberately designed to attain required responsive behaviors, such as the non-uniform displacement field. However, the discontinuity of the physical property distribution between the building blocks in the resulted structure, often leads to problems such as excessive stress concentration in the joining areas and limited design flexibility. To overcome the above problems, we proposed a new method for automatic design of functional metamaterials to achieve continuity in both geometry and physical properties. The fundamental theory of the method is the incorporation of spherical harmonics to represent and modulate the spatial distribution of stiffness, which then serves as a non-uniform distribution function for stochastic generation of anisotropic spinodal infills with high continuity. The proposed method have potential wide applications for designing functional components with programmed responsive behaviors, such as realizing customized tissue supporting and information encoding.

The double ionization potential (DIP) equation-of-motion (EOM) coupled-cluster (CC) method with 4-hole--2-particle (4$h$-2$p$) excitations on top of the CC with singles, doubles, and triples calculation, abbreviated as DIP-EOMCCSDT(4$h$-2$p$), along with its perturbative DIP-EOMCCSD(T)(a)(4$h$-2$p$) approximation, are extended to a relativistic four-component (4c) framework. In addition, we introduce and test a new computationally practical DIP-EOMCC approach, which we call DIP-EOMCCSD(T)($\tilde{a}$)(4$h$-2$p$), that approximates the treatment of 4$h$-2$p$ correlations within the DIP-EOMCCSD(T)(a) (4$h$-2$p$) method and reduces the $\mathscr{N}^8$ scaling characterizing DIP-EOMCCSDT(4$h$-2$p$) and DIP-EOMCCSD(T)(a)(4$h$-2$p$) to $\mathscr{N}^7$ with the system size $\mathscr{N}$. Further improvements in computational efficiency are obtained using the frozen natural spinor (FNS) approximation to reduce the numbers of unoccupied spinors entering the correlated steps of the DIP-EOMCC calculations according to a well-defined occupation-number-based threshold. The resulting 4c-FNS-DIP-EOMCC approaches are used to compute DIPs for the series of inert gas atoms from argon to radon as well as the vertical DIPs in \Cltwo{}, \Brtwo{}, HBr, and HI, which have been experimentally examined in the past. We demonstrate that, when using complete basis set extrapolations and FNS truncation thresholds of $10^{-4.5}$, the 4c-FNS-DIP-EOMCCSD(T)($\tilde{a}$)(4$h$-2$p$) calculations are capable of predicting DIPs in agreement with experimental data, improving upon their nonrelativistic and spin-free scalar-relativistic counterparts, particularly when examining DIPs characterized by stronger spin-orbit coupling effects.

Physical mechanism behind the early onset of the ultimate state in supergravitational centrifugal thermal convection
Lei Ren, Jun Zhong, Rushi Lai, Chao Sun
Subjects:
Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
We present a combined experimental and numerical investigation of the transition from the classical to the ultimate regime of thermal turbulence in a supergravitational centrifugal convection system. The transition is found to be robust, with the critical Rayleigh number decreasing systematically as the Froude number, defined as the ratio of centrifugal to Earth's gravity, decreases, highlighting the effect of residual gravity. Once the Rayleigh number reaches the transition threshold, the Stewartson layer induced by residual Earth gravity becomes comparable in thickness to the viscous boundary layer, and their interaction results in a coupled flow that distorts the viscous boundary layer, triggering its transition from laminar to turbulent flow and leading to a sharp increase in heat transport. These findings demonstrate the key role of the Stewartson layer induced by residual gravity in facilitating the transition to the ultimate regime in supergravitational centrifugal thermal convection.

In this work, using the time-dependent density functional theory, we address the electron tunneling triggered by short (single-cycle and several-cycle) optical pulses in narrow metallic gaps under conditions relevant for actual experiments. We identify photon-assisted tunneling with one-photon, two-photon, and higher-order photon absorption, and we discuss the effect of the tunneling barrier, applied bias, and strength of the optical field on transition from photon-assisted tunneling (weak optical fields) to the optical field emission at strong optical fields. The numerical single-electron calculations and an analytical strong-field theory model are used to gain deeper insights into the results of the time-dependent density functional theory calculations. Additionally, our parameter-free calculations allow us to retrieve and explain recent experimental results on optically induced transport in narrow metallic gaps.

Personalized cardiac diagnostics require accurate reconstruction of myocardial displacement fields from sparse clinical imaging data, yet current methods often demand intrusive access to computational models. In this work, we apply the non-intrusive Parametrized-Background Data-Weak (PBDW) approach to three-dimensional (3D) cardiac displacement field reconstruction from limited Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI)-like observations. Our implementation requires only solution snapshots -- no governing equations, assembly routines, or solver access -- enabling immediate deployment across commercial and research codes using different constitutive models. Additionally, we introduce two enhancements: an H-size minibatch worst-case Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (wOMP) algorithm that improves Sensor Selection (SS) computational efficiency while maintaining reconstruction accuracy, and memory optimization techniques exploiting block matrix structures in vectorial problems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method through validation on a 3D left ventricular model with simulated scar tissue. Starting with noise-free reconstruction, we systematically incorporate Gaussian noise and spatial sparsity mimicking realistic MRI acquisition protocols. Results show exceptional accuracy in noise-free conditions (relative L2 error of order O(1e-5)), robust performance with 10% noise (relative L2 error of order O(1e-2)), and effective reconstruction from sparse measurements (relative L2 error of order O(1e-2)). The online reconstruction achieves four-order-of-magnitude computational speed-up compared to full Finite Element (FE) simulations, with reconstruction times under one tenth of second for sparse scenarios, demonstrating significant potential for integration into clinical cardiac modeling workflows.

Optics (physics.optics); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
Controlling the state of motion of optically levitated nanoparticles is crucial for the advancement of precision sensing, fundamental tests of physics, and the development of hybrid classical-quantum technologies. Experimentally, such control can be achieved by pulsed modifications of the optical potential confining the nanoparticle. Most frequently, the applied potential pulses are parabolic in nanoparticle position, and they expand/squeeze or displace the initial Gaussian state of motion to a modified Gaussian state. The time-dependent mean values and covariance matrix of the phase-space variables can fully characterize such a state. However, quasi-parabolic optical potentials with added weak Duffing-type nonlinearity, encountered in real-world experiments, can generally distort the state of motion to a non-Gaussian one, for which the description based solely on the mean values and covariance matrix fails. Here, we introduce a nonlinear transformation of the phase-space coordinates using the concept of Fermat's spiral, which effectively removes the state distortion induced by the Duffing-type nonlinearity and enables characterization of the state of motion by the standard Gaussian-state metrics. Comparisons of the experimental data with theoretical models show that the proposed coordinate transformation can recover the ideal behavior of a harmonic oscillator even after extended evolution of the system in the nonlinear potential. The presented scheme enables the separation of the effects of the applied state manipulation, the system's gradual thermalization, and the nonlinearity of the confinement on the experimentally observed dynamics of the system, thereby facilitating the design of advanced protocols for levitated optomechanics.

Understanding Modal Interactions in Non-classically Damped Linear Oscillators with Closely Spaced Modes

This work addresses non-classically damped coupled oscillators with closely spaced modes focusing on the physics of modal interactions. Considering the simplest representative example in the form of an impulsively excited two-degree-of-freedom (two-DOF) system, we show that there is a single parameter defined as a coupling versus damping non-proportionality ratio, that separates two different dynamical regimes. Based on complexification-averaging analysis, we show that, below the critical value of this parameter, the system response possesses two distinct dissipation rates but only one frequency of oscillation; as a result, energy is slowly exchanged between modes in a single beat phenomenon. However, above the critical parameter value, the response has a single dissipation rate but two distinct oscillation frequencies; this yields an infinity of beat phenomena as energy is interchanged at a faster rate between modes. Our analytical predictions are fully validated by experimental measurements. Our findings highlight the physics of modal interactions in coupled oscillators and provide a framework for system identification and reduced-order modeling of systems with closely spaced modes.

Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det)
This proceedings contains our considerations made during and after fruitful discussions held at EuCAIFCon 2025. We explore the use of deep reinforcement learning for autonomous locking of Fabry-Perot optical cavities in non-linear regimes, with relevance to gravitational-wave detectors. A custom Gymnasium environment with a time-domain simulator enabled training of agents such as deep deterministic policy gradient, achieving reliable lock acquisition for both low- and high-finesse cavities, including Virgo-like parameters. We also discuss possible improvements with Twin Delayed DDPG, Soft Actor Critic and meta-reinforcement learning, as well as strategies for low-latency execution and off-line policy updates to address hardware limitations. These studies lay the groundwork for future deployment of reinforcement learning-based control in real optical setups.

Supersonic gas curtain based real-time ionization profile monitor for hadron therapy

Accelerator Physics (physics.acc-ph)
Accurate control and monitoring of the beam is essential for precise dose delivery to tumor tissues during radiotherapy. Real-time monitoring of ion beam profiles and positions improves beam control, patient safety, and treatment reliability by providing immediate feedback. This becomes even more critical in FLASH therapy, where the short corrective window during high-dose delivery demands precise beam control. Existing devices are often limited to in vitro calibration or focus on monitoring a single parameter during treatment. This study aims to develop a device that can simultaneously monitor beam position, profile, current, and energy in real-time, without perturbing the beam, using a supersonic gas curtain system. A supersonic gas curtain beam profile monitor was developed at the Cockcroft Institute to assess its performance and suitability for applications in hadron-beam therapy. The system was integrated with one of the beamlines of the Pelletron accelerator at the Dalton Cumbrian Facility, UK and 2D profile measurements of carbon beams were conducted. The monitor successfully measured the beam profiles within 100ms to 1s across various beam currents (1 - 100 nA), energies (12 - 24 MeV), and charge states (2-5) of carbon. Recorded data was used to estimate detector performance by introducing a parameter called detection limit to quantify sensitivity of the monitor, identifying the threshold number of ions required for detection onset. A method to quantify sensitivity under different beam conditions is then discussed in detail, illustrated with an example case of FLASH beam parameters. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the performance of the gas curtain-based ionization profile monitor for 2D transverse beam profile measurement of carbon ions. The sensitivity is quantified and evaluated against an example case for FLASH conditions.

We propose a non-uniform modulation of $\chi^{(2)}_{xyz}$ to significantly enhance photon pair generation efficiency via spontaneous parametric down-conversion in modal phase-matched semiconductor waveguides. This approach enables amplitude-matching in the transverse direction while preserving the phase-matching along the waveguide propagation axis. Our analysis predicts a tenfold efficiency increase in comparison to the most efficient non-modulated waveguide, and up to 13 orders of magnitude efficiency enhancements relative to solely phase-matched waveguides. Furthermore, we explore the implementation of a highly efficient compact twin-photon source, tunable across the communication band, using an amplitude- and phase-matched structure.

X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) of high brightness have opened new opportunities for exploring ultrafast dynamical processes in matter, enabling imaging and movies of single molecules and particles at atomic resolution. In this paper, we present a straightforward method for multi-frame diffraction imaging, using the same electron beam to generate four-color XFEL pulses with adjustable wavelength separation and time delay. The optical klystron scheme is introduced to enhance FEL intensity and reduce the total length of undulators. The time delay is tuned via a magnetic chicane between the undulators with various colors. Using parameters of SHINE, start-to-end simulations demonstrate the effectiveness and tunability of our method, achieving representative results such as time delays of hundreds of femtoseconds and four-color XFEL pulses spanning 1.8 to 2.7 nm with 0.3 nm intervals. The proposed scheme enables the recording of multi-frame diffraction images in a single exposure, providing a new perspective for ultrafast molecular and atomic dynamics studies.

Fluorescence-detected Wavepacket Interferometry reveals time-varying Exciton Relaxation Pathways in single Light-Harvesting Complexes

Photosynthesis relies on efficient energy relaxation within the excited-state manifold of pigment-protein complexes. Since the protein scaffold is rather flexible, the resulting energetic and structural disorder gives rise to a complex excited-state energy level structure that fluctuates on all time scales. Although the impact of such fluctuations on relaxation processes is known, the precise exciton states involved in relaxation as well as the nature of the vibrational modes driving relaxation are under debate. Here single pigment-protein complexes from a photosynthetic purple bacterium are excited with two identical ultrashort phase-locked pulses producing two exciton wave packets that can interfere. This leads to a modulation of the emission intensity as a function of the delay time between the pulses that fades out within about 100 fs due to fluctuating environments on those time scales. For several single complexes we find variations of the interference patterns on time scale of several 10 s that reveal fluctuations in the energy relaxation pathways towards the lowest-energy exciton states. This relaxation is driven by temporal variations in the coupling between electronic excitations and low-frequency vibrational modes.

Inspired by machine learning optimization: can gradient-based optimizers solve cycle skipping in full waveform inversion given sufficient iterations?

Full waveform inversion (FWI) iteratively updates the velocity model by minimizing the difference between observed and simulated data. Due to the high computational cost and memory requirements associated with global optimization algorithms, FWI is typically implemented using local optimization methods. However, when the initial velocity model is inaccurate and low-frequency seismic data (e.g., below 3 Hz) are absent, the mismatch between simulated and observed data may exceed half a cycle, a phenomenon known as cycle skipping. In such cases, local optimization algorithms (e.g., gradient-based local optimizers) tend to converge to local minima, leading to inaccurate inversion results. In machine learning, neural network training is also an optimization problem prone to local minima. It often employs gradient-based optimizers with a relatively large learning rate (beyond the theoretical limits of local optimization that are usually determined numerically by a line search), which allows the optimization to behave like a quasi-global optimizer. Consequently, after training for several thousand iterations, we can obtain a neural network model with strong generative capability. In this study, we also employ gradient-based optimizers with a relatively large learning rate for FWI. Results from both synthetic and field data experiments show that FWI may initially converge to a local minimum; however, with sufficient additional iterations, the inversion can gradually approach the global minimum, slowly from shallow subsurface to deep, ultimately yielding an accurate velocity model. Furthermore, numerical examples indicate that, given sufficient iterations, reasonable velocity inversion results can still be achieved even when low-frequency data below 5 Hz are missing.

Enhancing light-matter interactions depends critically on the ability to tailor photonic modes at subwavelength scales, and combining distinct resonant modes has shown remarkable potential unattainable by individual resonances alone. Despite recent advances in anapole metasurfaces for energy confinement and Fabry-Perot (FP) cavities for spectral control, their synergistic coupling and resulting opportunities remain largely unexplored due to challenges such as precise nanoscale assembly. Here, we demonstrate that embedding a terahertz (THz) anapole metasurface within a tunable FP cavity results in a hybrid cavity that demonstrates exotic properties as the anapole transitions between coupling to FP resonances and anti-resonances via cavity-length tuning. At room temperature, we observe ultrastrong coupling (> 30% of the anapole frequency) between anapoles and FP resonances, generating tunable-dispersion polaritons that blend favorable properties of both modes. Meanwhile, anapole spectrally aligns with FP anti-resonances, leading to weak coupling that narrows the linewidth of the anapole's transmission peak by two orders of magnitude and enhances its local density of states (LDOS) near the metasurface correspondingly. With exceptional capabilities including formation of polaritons and significant enhancement of LDOS, the hybrid cavity enables strong interaction with functional materials, paving the way for exploration of quantum optics, molecular sensing, and ultrafast nonlinear photonics.

Hybrid nanostructures from metal nanoparticles equipped with conducting polymer shells are of great interest for use as functional materials in sensing and optoelectronics, as well as for ink-deposited conductors. Here, we investigate the charge transport mechanism of nanostructures composed of gold nanoparticles coated with a polyaniline shell (Au@PANI). In particular, we focus on how geometry influences the charge transport behavior. Highly ordered linear assemblies of Au@PANI nanoparticles were fabricated using template-assisted assembly, while bulk-like films were obtained via drop-casting. Temperature-dependent transport measurements were analyzed using established theoretical models. Linear assemblies exhibit more localized transport, characterized by variable-range hopping (VRH) and thermally assisted tunneling (TAT), whereas bulk-like films show more delocalized transport, dominated by Arrhenius-type and thermionic conduction. These findings highlight the critical role of geometry in determining charge transport mechanisms in nanoparticle-based hybrid systems.

Computational electro-optic frequency comb spectroscopy

Subjects:
Optics (physics.optics)
Computational techniques have gained significant traction in photonics, enabling the co-design of hardware and data processing algorithms to drastically simplify optical system architectures and improve their performance. However, their application in optical frequency comb spectroscopy remains considerably underexplored. In this work, we introduce a non-interferometric approach to frequency comb spectroscopy based on dynamically tailored electro-optic modulation. The core of our method is a reconfigurable electro-optic comb generator capable of producing a sequence of known comb spectra to interrogate a spectroscopic sample. Instead of recording spectrally resolved or interferometric data, our system captures a set of integrated optical power measurements--one per probe comb--from which the sample's spectral response is computationally reconstructed by solving an inverse problem. We present the theoretical foundations of this method, assess its limitations, and validate it through numerical simulations. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the experimental reconstruction of several spectral signatures, including a molecular absorption line at 1545 nm. For these results, we use numerically computed spectra and experimentally measured power values, all acquired within 10 milliseconds. Finally, we discuss potential extensions and improvements of the method, as well as its integration into chip-scale spectroscopic systems.

Subjects:
Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
The pinch-off dynamics of a Newtonian liquid thread embedded in a viscoplastic medium is investigated using direct numerical simulations and theory. Thread breakup occurs below a nearly universal threshold set by the balance of capillary and yield stresses, largely independent of the viscosity ratio at low Ohnesorge numbers. Regime maps in the Ohnesorge-plastocapillary number plane reveal distinct boundaries, and scaling analysis captures the minimum thread radius in excellent agreement with simulations. These results provide a predictive framework for thread dynamics in complex fluids and highlight the role of stress localization in viscoplastic environments. The obtained insights are relevant for embedded additive manufacturing and other technologies involving fluid threads in complex media.

Optical atomic clocks play a crucial role in fundamental physics, relativistic geodesy, and the future redefinition of the SI second. Standard operation relies on cyclic interrogation sequences, which alternate between atomic interrogation and dead time used for state preparation and readout. This approach introduces the Dick effect, where laser frequency noise aliases onto the atomic transition frequency. Although reducing laser noise improves clock stability, the Dick effect remains a key limitation. In this work, we demonstrate a zero-dead-time optical clock based on two interleaved ensembles of cold $^{87}\text{Sr}$ atoms. Our system significantly suppresses this noise and achieves a fractional frequency instability at the $10^{-19}$ level between 10,000 and 20,000 seconds over repeated measurements, with a best value of $2.9 \times 10^{-19}$ at $\tau = 20,000$ seconds. The estimated long-term stability based on the combined data of these measurements reaches $2.5 \times 10^{-19}$ at one day. These results represent a more than ninefold improvement over a conventional single-ensemble clock, highlighting its potential for next-generation timekeeping applications.

We study the classical dynamics of a Paul-trapped ion in a low-density bath of atoms above 1 $\mu\textrm{K}$. We find that lower energy collisions with more massive atoms, especially at energies less than the initial micromotion heating, are more likely to form atom-ion complexes. These complexes evolve in a fractal structure for every scattering observable, showing non-hyperbolic chaotic dynamics. To explore the chaotic dynamics, we use a GPU-accelerated methodology allowing us to run over $3\times 10^{8}$ trajectories of a $^{174}$Yb$^+$ and different atoms. As a result, after analyzing the dynamics as a function of the atom species, collision energy, trap parameters, and ion-atom potential depth, we find a link between heating and the onset of chaos in the first atom-ion interaction that occurs when a low-density atomic bath is merged with a trapped ion.

Super resonance: Breaking the bandwidth limit of resonant modes and its application to flow control

Subjects:
Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
We report the discovery of super resonance--a new regime of resonant behavior in which a mode's out-of-phase response persists far beyond its classical bandwidth. This effect emerges from a coiled phononic structure composed of a locally resonant elastic metamaterial and architected to support multiple internal energy pathways. These pathways converge at a single structural point, enabling extended modal dominance and significantly broadening the frequency range over which a resonant phase is sustained. We demonstrate by direct numerical simulations the implications of this mechanism in the context of flow instability control, where current approaches are inherently constrained by the characteristically narrow spectral bandwidth of conventional resonances. Using a super-resonant phononic subsurface structure interfacing with a channel flow, we show passive simultaneous suppression of four unstable flow perturbations across a frequency range more than five times wider than that is achievable with a standard resonance in an equivalent uncoiled structure. By enabling broadband, passive control of flow instabilities, super resonance overcomes a longstanding limitation in laminar flow control strategies. More broadly, it introduces a powerful new tool for phase-engineered wave-matter interaction. The ability to preserve out-of-phase modal response across wide spectral ranges establishes a fundamental advance in the physics of resonance, with far-reaching implications for suppressing fully developed turbulent flows and beyond.

Top- and bottom-heavy vertical velocity structures: physical modes of layered atmospheric models
Fiaz Ahmed, J. David Neelin
Subjects:
Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics (physics.ao-ph)
Tropical East and West Pacific Oceans display differences in their vertical velocity (or omega) profiles. The East Pacific is characterized by bottom-heavy profiles, while the West Pacific is characterized by top-heavy profiles. Although inter-basin differences in the horizontal SST gradient are known to be important, physical reasons for why these omega structure variants exist are not fully understood. This question is addressed using a steady, linear model on an $f$-plane with $n$ atmospheric layers. Convection and radiation are parameterized as linear responses to thermodynamic perturbations with convective nonlinearity approximated by convection on/off regimes. The free (or eigen) modes of the model yield vertical structures resembling the observed baroclinic modes of the tropical atmosphere, with each mode associated with a characteristic horizontal scale (the eigenvalue). In the standard parameter regime, the first-baroclinic mode has a large spatial scale ($\sim$ 1500 km) while the second-baroclinic mode has a smaller spatial scale ($\sim$ 250 km). When the model is forced with a strong- and weak-gradient surface temperature ($T_s$) patterns, the resulting omega profiles assume bottom- and top-heavy structures respectively -- mimicking the observed differences between East and West Pacific Oceans. Additional dependence on the magnitude of the Coriolis force is also observed. The connection between the vertical structure and the horizontal scale of the baroclinic modes explains why a strong-gradient $T_s$ profile projects strongly onto the second-baroclinic mode yielding bottom-heavy omega profiles in the eastern Pacific, while a weak-gradient $T_s$ profile projects strongly onto the first-baroclinic mode, yielding top-heavy omega profiles typical of the Western Pacific.

We define the hierarchy parameter, h, involving two "weights" (alphas), measuring the importance of excitation (e) and seniority (s) contributions to the wavefunction according to: h = {\alpha}1.e + {\alpha}2.s. We test these new CI methods on the dissociation of chemical systems and analyze them based on the importance of these contributions.

Localized In-Plane Cavity Optomechanics in MEMS

Subjects:
Optics (physics.optics); Pattern Formation and Solitons (nlin.PS)
This study demonstrates the realization of localized in-plane optomechanical microcavities embedded within an electrostatic MEMS architecture. The system consists of a curved, clamped-clamped microbeam, fabricated on a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer. A green laser emitted from a Laser Doppler Vibrometer (LDV), is directed perpendicularly onto the device under a vacuum pressure of 7 mTorr, with the beam aligned to fill the gap between the movable microbeam and its adjacent side fixed mirror. This configuration forms localized cavity optomechanical resonators that enable the generation of optomechanical soliton frequency combs through phonon lasing without electrical excitation. The optomechanical resonators' dynamics are examined through experiments and numerical simulations. First, the experimental findings unveil that in electrostatic MEMS structures, the two reflective electrodes positioned to form a capacitive gap can inadvertently form localized cavities. These cavities significantly affect optical readouts, as the photodetected signal encodes contributions from both Doppler-shifted electromagnetic waves and light scattered from the intracavity optical field. This dual contributions can distort mechanical response interpretation unless appropriately filtered. Second, experiments show that optical pumping at various positions along the microbeam induces periodic pulse trains with distinct free spectral ranges (FSRs), each corresponding to different mechanical modes. Our results present the generation of solitary optical wavepackets using in-plane localized Fabry-Pérot microcavities formed within a MEMS device. The results suggest a path toward chip-scale, soliton frequency combs generators featuring frequency spacing on the order of kilohertz, without relying on integrated fiber optics.

Chiral molecular junctions offer a promising platform for realizing chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS), where spin filtering occurs without external magnetic fields. Here, we investigate spin transport in such junctions by combining quantum master equation (QME) methods for purely electronic dynamics with surface hopping (SH) and mean-field Ehrenfest (MF) approaches to incorporate electron-phonon coupling. Our results show that transient spin polarization arises but ultimately decays to zero at long times. We find that bias voltage, molecular length, and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) strongly influence the spin current dynamics: higher bias enhances spin current but reduces polarization, while longer molecules and stronger SOC amplify transient polarization. Including electron-phonon coupling modifies current-voltage characteristics, enhancing spin currents at intermediate bias but suppressing them at high bias, while leaving the polarization dynamics largely unchanged. These findings highlight the interplay between electronic and vibrational effects in CISS and provide guidance for designing molecular spintronic devices.

Most of his career, however, was devoted to studying the universe as a quantum system. As a result, he was known as the father of quantum cosmology. He is best known for two seminal papers with Stephen Hawking that introduced two quantum states of fundamental importance: the "Hartle-Hawking vacuum" for matter fields outside a black hole, and the "no-boundary wave function of the universe" for cosmology. Jim (as everyone called him) was a warm and caring person who was genuinely concerned with the success of his students, postdocs, and colleagues. He was generous with his time and helped to foster a culture of a welcoming family among gravitational physicists.

We propose the Semiconductor-Quantum-Well Axion Radiometer Experiment ($\texttt{SQWARE}$) -- a new experimental platform for direct detection of axion dark matter in the meV mass range -- based on resonantly enhanced axion-photon conversion through the inverse Primakoff effect in engineered quantum semiconductor heterostructures. The core of the radiometer is a GaAs/AlGaAs multiple quantum well structure forming a magnetoplasmonic cavity, containing an ultrahigh-mobility two-dimensional electron gas, which realizes a tunable epsilon-near-zero resonance in the terahertz frequency range. By controlling the orientation of the cavity within a strong external magnetic field, both the resonance frequency and the axion-induced current are optimized $\textit{in situ}$, enabling efficient scanning across a broad mass range without complex mechanical adjustment. The axion-induced electromagnetic signal radiatively emitted from the magnetoplasmonic cavity is detected by a state-of-the-art photodetector. We present the theoretical basis for resonant enhancement, detail the experimental design and benchmarks through extensive simulations, and project the sensitivity of $\texttt{SQWARE}$ for several realistic configurations. Our results demonstrate that $\texttt{SQWARE}$ can probe the well-motivated quantum chromodynamics axion parameter space and close a critical gap in direct searches at meV masses.

Quantum kernel methods promise enhanced expressivity for learning structured data, but their usefulness has been limited by kernel concentration and barren plateaus. Both effects are mathematically equivalent and suppress trainability. We analytically prove that covariant quantum kernels tailored to datasets with group symmetries avoid exponential concentration, ensuring stable variance and guaranteed trainability independent of system size. Our results extend beyond prior two-coset constructions to arbitrary coset families, broadening the scope of problems where quantum kernels can achieve advantage. We further derive explicit bounds under coherent noise models - including unitary errors in fiducial state preparation, imperfect unitary representations, and perturbations in group element selection - and show through numerical simulations that the kernel variance remains finite and robust, even under substantial noise. These findings establish a family of quantum learning models that are simultaneously trainable, resilient to coherent noise, and linked to classically hard problems, positioning group-symmetric quantum kernels as a promising foundation for near-term and scalable quantum machine learning.

The Schelling model is a prototype for agent-based modeling in social systems. A comprehensive analysis of Schelling model rule variants is achieved by classification of the space of macroscopic outcomes via phase diagrams. Among 54 rule variants, only 3 phase diagram classes are found, characterized by the number of phase transitions. This classification scheme is found to be robust to the use of sociological and percolation-inspired measures of segregation. The statistical and dynamic drivers of these transitions are elucidated by analyzing the roles of vision, movement criteria, vacancies, the initial state, and rivalry. Schelling's original step function dictating satisfaction is found to be pathological at high thresholds, producing coordination failures as satisfactory sites become increasingly rare. This comprehensive classification gives new insight into the drivers of transitions in the Schelling model and creates a basis for studying more complex Schelling-like models.

Validating our model on two illustrative case studies -- the 1D Poisson equation with a Gaussian source and the 2D Fisher-KPP equation, we found that E-PINN generated empirical coverage probabilities that were calibrated significantly better than Bayesian PINN and Deep Ensemble methods. To demonstrate real-world applicability, we also present a brief case study on applying E-PINN to analyze clinical glucose-insulin datasets that have featured in medical research on diabetes pathophysiology.

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provide atomistic insight into biomolecular systems but are often limited by high computational costs required to access long timescales. Coarse-grained machine learning models offer a promising avenue for accelerating sampling, yet conventional force matching approaches often fail to capture the full thermodynamic landscape as fitting a model on the gradient may not fit the absolute differences between low-energy conformational states. In this work, we incorporate a complementary energy matching term into the loss function. We evaluate our framework on the Chignolin protein using the CGSchNet model, systematically varying the weight of the energy loss term. While energy matching did not yield statistically significant improvements in accuracy, it revealed distinct tendencies in how models generalize the free energy surface. Our results suggest future opportunities to enhance coarse-grained modeling through improved energy estimation techniques and multi-modal loss formulations.

Topological defects are central to modern physics, from spintronics to photonics, due to their robustness and potential application in information processing. In this work, we discuss topological point defects that spontaneously emerge at the imaginary Fermi arcs (degeneracy lines) in momentum space of two-dimensional systems described by non-Hermitian effective Hamiltonians. In particular, we consider a generic non-Hermitian Dirac model and a phenomenological model describing hybrid light-matter quasiparticles - exciton polaritons hosted in an optical microcavity. In both cases, the eigenenergies of the system have both real and imaginary parts and form two distinct bands corresponding to two (pseudo-)spin states. We describe the trajectories of the point defects characterized by integer-valued topological winding (vorticity) analytically and show that the defects with opposite vorticity annihilate with each other in the fully gapped phases, but are protected from annihilation by the non-Hermitian spectral degeneracies (exceptional and hybrid points) in the gapless phases. We also suggest that the signatures of these defects can be experimentally measured in an exciton-polariton system.

We present experiments demonstrating tube formation in giant unilamellar vesicles that are suspended in a bath of swimming E. coli bacteria. We chose the lipids such that the bacteria have no adhereing interaction with the membrane. The tubes are generated by the pushing force exerted by the bacteria on the membrane of the vesicles. Once generated, the bacteria are confined within the tubes, resulting in long-lived tubes that protrude into the vesicle. We show that such tubes interact to form stable bound pairs that orbit each other. We speculate that the tubes are maintained by the persistent pushing force generated by the bacterium, and the rotating pairs are stabilized by a combination of curvature mediated interaction and vorticity generated in the membrane by the rotation of the flagella.

Decoherence errors arising from noisy environments remain a central obstacle to progress in quantum computation and information processing. Quantum error correction (QEC) based on the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) protocol offers a powerful strategy to overcome this challenge, with successful demonstrations in trapped ions, superconducting circuits, and photonics. Beyond active QEC, a compelling alternative is to engineer Hamiltonians that intrinsically enforce stabilizers, offering passive protection akin to topological models. Inspired by the GKP encoding scheme, we implement a superconducting qubit whose eigenstates form protected grid states - long envisioned but not previously realized - by integrating an effective Cooper-quartet junction with a quantum phase-slip element embedded in a high-impedance circuit. Spectroscopic measurements reveal pairs of degenerate states separated by large energy gaps, in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions. Remarkably, our observations indicate that the circuit tolerates small disorders and gains robustness against environmental noise as its parameters approach the ideal regime, establishing a new framework for exploring superconducting hardware. These findings also showcase the versatility of the superconducting circuit toolbox, setting the stage for future exploration of advanced solid-state devices with emergent properties.

Stochastic Clock Attention for Aligning Continuous and Ordered Sequences

We formulate an attention mechanism for continuous and ordered sequences that explicitly functions as an alignment model, which serves as the core of many sequence-to-sequence tasks. Standard scaled dot-product attention relies on positional encodings and masks but does not enforce continuity or monotonicity, which are crucial for frame-synchronous targets. We propose learned nonnegative \emph{clocks} to source and target and model attention as the meeting probability of these clocks; a path-integral derivation yields a closed-form, Gaussian-like scoring rule with an intrinsic bias toward causal, smooth, near-diagonal alignments, without external positional regularizers. The framework supports two complementary regimes: normalized clocks for parallel decoding when a global length is available, and unnormalized clocks for autoregressive decoding -- both nearly-parameter-free, drop-in replacements. In a Transformer text-to-speech testbed, this construction produces more stable alignments and improved robustness to global time-scaling while matching or improving accuracy over scaled dot-product baselines. We hypothesize applicability to other continuous targets, including video and temporal signal modeling.

A General Model for Static Contact Angles

Subjects:
Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft); Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
The problem of contact angle and hysteresis determination has direct implications for engineering applications of wetting, colloid and surface science. Significant technical challenges can arise under real-world operating conditions, because the static contact angle is strongly influenced by contamination at the liquid-solid and liquid-vapor interfaces, chemical aging over long times, and environmental variables such as relative humidity and temperature. Analytical models that account for these real-world effects are therefore highly desirable to guide the rational design of robust applications. This work proposes a unified and simple-to-use model that expands Young's local thermodynamic approach to consider surfaces with topographic features of general geometry and varying degrees of liquid infiltration. The unified model recovers classical wetting limits (Wenzel, Cassie-Baxter, and hemiwicking), accounts for observable intermediate states (e.g., impregnating Cassie), and identifies a new limiting state with potential realizability: a Cassie state accompanied by a precursor film, termed the Inverse Wenzel state.

Enhancement of Weak Interactions in Phase Transitions

Weak interactions cause small parity-violating energy differences between left- and right-handed chiral systems. Although normally tiny, these effects may be significantly enhanced during collective phenomena such as phase transitions. We propose a theoretical model describing the enhancement of weak interactions in phase transitions. The enhancement factor is proportional to the critical number of atoms, $N_c$, in the nucleus of the new phase. After the nucleus reaches its critical size, it grows until it fills the entire system. Measurement of the ratio of produced left and right chiral structures may provide a way to measure this critical number $N_c$. Experiments where definite spin-chiral structures are formed during a phase transition in crossed electric and magnetic fields, indicate $N_c \sim 10^9 - 10^{10}$. An open question is whether a similar enhancement could operate during cosmological phase transitions - thereby boosting CP-violating effects sufficiently to contribute to the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry (baryogenesis).

Computational uncertainties in lattice thermal conductivity prediction of crystalline solids

We report computational uncertainties in Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE)-based lattice thermal conductivity prediction of 50 diverse semiconductors from the use of different BTE solvers (ShengBTE, Phono3Py, and in-house code) and interatomic forces. The interatomic forces are obtained either using the density functional theory (DFT) as implemented in packages Quantum Espresso and VASP employing commonly used exchange correlation functionals (PBE, LDA, PBEsol, and rSCAN) or using the pre-trained foundational machine learning forcefields trained on two different material datasets.
We find that the considered BTE solvers introduce minimal uncertainties and, using the same interatomic force constants, all solvers result in an excellent agreement with each other, with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of only 1%. While this error increases to around 10% with the use of different DFT packages, the error is still small and can be reduced further with the use of stringent planewave energy cutoffs. On the other hand, the differences in thermal conductivity due to the use of different exchange correlation functionals are large, with a MAPE of more than 20%. The currently available pre-trained foundational ML models predict the right trend for thermal conductivity, but the associated errors are high, limiting their applications for coarse screening of materials.

Nanoscale films play a central role in biology and osmotic separations. Their water/salt selectivity is often regarded as intrinsic property, favoring thinner membranes for faster permeation. Here we highlight and quantify a fundamental limitation arising from the dependence of ion self-energy on film thickness, governed by its ratio to Bjerrum length. The resulting relation factors out this dependence from intrinsic ion permeability, which agrees well with available data and enables evaluation of dielectric properties of ultrathin films, advancing understanding of ion transport in membranes.

Transition-metal nitrides (TMNs) are currently being studied for potential applications in energy conversion. In this work, we used the Landauer approach to relate the various effects contributing to the thermoelectric efficiency of scandium nitride (ScN) to their microscopic origins. We model the impact of electronic and structural modifications induced by oxygen impurities and spatial vacancies on electronic transport in ScN nanostructures. Taking advantage of the results of our calculations, we propose a theoretical interpretation of recent experimental results revealing a strong dependence of the thermoelectric properties of ScN thin films on procedural variations during fabrication. The thermoelectric properties of ScN are decisively influenced by structural and electronic factors arising from defects or impurities. Our findings highlight the potential of this theoretical approach in studying thermoelectricity and uncovering future strategies to improve thermoelectric efficiency.

Hydrodynamic Attraction and Hindered Diffusion Govern First-passage Times of Swimming Microorganisms

The motion of microorganisms in their natural habitat is strongly influenced by their propulsion mechanisms, geometrical constraints, and random fluctuations. Here, we study numerically the first-passage-time (FPT) statistics of microswimmers, modeled as force-dipoles, to reach a no-slip wall. Our results demonstrate that hindered diffusion near the wall can increase the median FPT by orders of magnitude compared to "dry" agents, while the intricate interplay of active motion and hydrodynamic attraction speeds up the arrival at large Péclet numbers (measuring the importance of self-propulsion relative to diffusion). Strikingly, it leads to a non-monotonic behavior as a function of the dipole strength, where pushers reach the wall significantly faster than pullers. The latter become slower at an intermediate dipole strength and are more sensitive to their initial orientation, displaying a highly anisotropic behavior.

The interpretation of experiments on reactive semiconductor surfaces requires statistically significant sampling of molecular dynamics, but conventional ab initio methods are limited due to prohibitive computational costs. Machine-learning interatomic potentials provide a promising solution, bridging the gap between the chemical accuracy of short ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) and the extensive sampling required to simulate experiment. Using ethinyl-functionalized cyclooctyne adsorption on Si(001) as a model system, we demonstrate that conventional AIMD undersamples the configurational space, resulting in discrepancies with scanning tunnelling microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data. To resolve these inconsistencies, we employ pre-trained equivariant message-passing neural networks, fine-tuned on only a few thousand AIMD snapshots, and integrate them into a "molecular-gun" workflow. This approach generates 10,000 independent trajectories more than 1,000 times faster than AIMD. These simulations recover rare intermediates, clarify the competition between adsorption motifs, and reproduce the experimentally dominant on-top [2+2] cycloaddition geometry. Our results show that fine-tuning of pre-trained foundational models enables statistically converged, chemically accurate simulations of bond-forming and bond-breaking events on complex surfaces, providing a scalable route to reconcile atomistic theory with experimental ensemble measurements in semiconductor functionalization.

Quantum Gambling: Best-Arm Strategies for Generator Selection in Adaptive Variational Algorithms
Rick Huang, Artur F. Izmaylov
Subjects:
Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph)
Adaptive variational algorithms suffer from prohibitively high measurement costs during the generator selection step, since energy gradients must be estimated for a large operator pool. This scaling bottleneck limits their applicability to larger molecular systems on near-term quantum devices. We address this challenge by reformulating generator selection as a Best Arm Identification (BAI) problem, where the goal is to identify the generator with the largest energy gradient using as few measurements as possible. To solve it, we employ the Successive Elimination algorithm, which adaptively allocates measurements and discards unpromising candidates early. Numerical experiments on molecular systems demonstrate that this approach substantially reduces the number of measurements required while preserving ground-state energy accuracy. By cutting measurement overhead without sacrificing performance, our method makes adaptive variational algorithms more practical for near-term quantum simulations.

Coincidence imaging, also known as ghost imaging, is a technique that exploits correlations between two particles to reconstruct information about a specimen. The particle that relays the spatial information about the object remains completely non-interacting, while the particle used to probe the object is not spatially resolved. While ghost imaging has been primarily implemented on photonic platforms, it becomes particularly intriguing when applied to particles with fundamentally different properties, such as massive, charged electrons and massless, neutral photons, especially considering the role of both particles as cornerstones of highly advanced microscopic platforms. In this work, we investigate coincidence imaging using electron-cathodoluminescence photon pairs generated within a transmission electron microscope. Utilizing a custom-built free-space cathodoluminescence setup, we demonstrate ghost imaging of complex patterns. We are able to obtain a spatial resolution down to 2 $\mu$m, paving the way for adaptation of quantum-enhanced imaging techniques from photonic quantum optics to electron microscopy.

Towards universal property prediction in Cartesian space: TACE is all you need

Machine learning has revolutionized atomistic simulations and materials science, yet current approaches often depend on spherical-harmonic representations. Here we introduce the Tensor Atomic Cluster Expansion and Tensor Moment Potential, the first unified framework formulated entirely in Cartesian space for the systematic prediction of arbitrary structure-determined tensorial properties. TACE achieves this by decomposing atomic environments into a complete hierarchy of (irreducible) Cartesian tensors, ensuring symmetry-consistent representations that naturally encode invariance and equivariance constraints. Beyond geometry, TACE incorporates universal embeddings that flexibly integrate diverse attributes including basis sets, charges, magnetic moments and field perturbations. This allows explicit control over external invariants and equivariants in the prediction process. Long-range interactions are also accurately described through the Latent Ewald Summation module within the short-range approximation, providing a rigorous yet computationally efficient treatment of electrostatic interactions. We demonstrate that TACE attains accuracy, stability, and efficiency on par with or surpassing leading equivariant frameworks across finite molecules and extended materials, including in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks, spectra, hessians, external-field response, charged systems, magnetic systems, multi-fidelity training, and heterogeneous catalytic systems. Crucially, TACE bridges scalar and tensorial modeling and establishes a Cartesian-space paradigm that unifies and extends beyond the design space of spherical-harmonic-based methods. This work lays the foundation for a new generation of universal atomistic machine learning models capable of systematically capturing the rich interplay of geometry, fields and material properties within a single coherent framework.

Dark photons, which can kinetically mix with ordinary photons, represent the simplest extension to the standard model. Detecting their oscillations with visible photons could provide crucial insights into the nature of dark matter and fundamental interactions beyond the standard model. We propose a novel laboratory-based approach to detect dark photon oscillations using a laser in an Optical Time-domain Relectometry (OTDR) setup. The laser light propagating through the optical fiber undergoes oscillations with the dark photon, leading to measurable changes in the power flow. These oscillations can precisely measured,
leveraging its high sensitivity and efficiency in detecting small variations in the optical signal. This approach could provide a new avenue for probing dark photon oscillations in the laboratory and greatly improve the current experimental sensitivity to dark photon in a wide mass range.

Ultrafast controlling net magnetization in g-wave altermagnets via laser fields

Subjects:
Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph)
The diverse nodal spin structures in d/g/i-wave altermagnets (AM) may cause distinct light-induced spin responses yet remain poorly understood. Using time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), we reveal that laser induced ultrafast demagnetization dynamics in the g-wave AM CrSb are strongly governed by the laser incidence direction. Under normal incidence along the [0001] axis, two Cr sublattices exhibit symmetric temporal demagnetization but with different amplitudes, preserving the net-zero magnetization, unlike the behavior in d-wave AM. Off-normal incidence, however, induces pronounced asymmetric demagnetization between sublattices, transiently driving the system into a ferrimagnetic-like state with a sizable net magnetization. This direction-dependent response arises from the characteristic nodal structures in bulk g-wave AM electronic structure, which enable anisotropic optical intersite spin transfer (OISTR). By comparing g-wave and d-wave AMs, we propose that light-induced magnetization arises when laser polarization aligns with spin-uncompensated regions in electronic structures. This can be readily determined from the local spin density of states along specific band paths. Our results provide a fundamental understanding for laser-induced ultrafast dynamics in AM.

Accelerating materials development requires quantitative linkages between processing, microstructure, and properties. In this work, we introduce a framework for mapping microstructure onto a low-dimensional material manifold that is parametrized by processing conditions. A key innovation is treating microstructure as a stochastic process, defined as a distribution of microstructural instances rather than a single image, enabling the extraction of material state descriptors that capture the essential process-dependent features. We leverage the manifold hypothesis to assert that microstructural outcomes lie on a low-dimensional latent space controlled by only a few parameters. Using phase-field simulations of spinodal decomposition as a model material system, we compare multiple microstructure descriptors (two-point statistics, chord-length distributions, and persistent homology) in terms of two criteria: (1) intrinsic dimensionality of the latent space, and (2) invertibility of the processing-to-structure mapping. The results demonstrate that distribution-based descriptors can recover a two-dimensional latent structure aligned with the true processing parameters, yielding an invertible and physically interpretable mapping between processing and microstructure. In contrast, descriptors that do not account for microstructure variability either overestimate dimensionality or lose predictive fidelity. The constructed material manifold is shown to be locally continuous, wherein small changes in process variables correspond to smooth changes in microstructure descriptors. This data-driven manifold mapping approach provides a quantitative foundation for microstructure-informed process design and paves the way toward closed-loop optimization of processing--structure--property relationships in an integrated materials engineering context.

This paper presents a physics-informed framework that integrates graph convolutional networks (GCN) with long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture to forecast microstructure evolution over long time horizons in both 2D and 3D with remarkable performance across varied metrics. The proposed framework is composition-aware, trained jointly on datasets with different compositions, and operates in latent graph space, which enables the model to capture compositions and morphological dynamics while remaining computationally efficient. Compressing and encoding phase-field simulation data with convolutional autoencoders and operating in Latent graph space facilitates efficient modeling of microstructural evolution across composition, dimensions, and long-term horizons. The framework captures the spatial and temporal patterns of evolving microstructures while enabling long-range forecasting at reduced computational cost after training.

Zero indirect gaps in band models are typically viewed as unstable and achievable only through fine-tuning. Recent works, however, have revealed robust semimetallic phases in Hermitian systems where the indirect gap remains pinned at zero over a finite parameter range. Here, we extend this paradigm to non-Hermitian lattice models by studying a one-dimensional diamond-like system with gain and loss. We show that a zero indirect band gap can remain stable against non-Hermitian perturbations and identify the regimes where this robustness persists. Remarkably, we find that the zero indirect gap induces a suppression of the non-Hermitian skin effect distinct from other physical mechanics already discussed in the literature. Our results reveal new connections between indirect gaps, exceptional points and non-Hermitian skin effect, opening avenues for experimental realizations.

The technology of silicon anodes appears to be reaching maturity, with high-energy Si cells already in pilot-scale production. However, the performance of these systems can be difficult to replicate in academic settings, making it challenging to translate research findings into solutions that can be implemented by the battery industry. Part of this difficulty arises from the lack of access to engineered Si particles and anodes, as electrode formulations and the materials themselves have become valuable intellectual property for emerging companies. Here, we summarize the efforts by Argonne's Cell Analysis, Modeling, and Prototyping (CAMP) Facility in developing Si-based prototypes made entirely from commercially available materials. We describe the many challenges we encountered when testing high-loading electrodes (> 5 mAh/cm2) and discuss strategies to mitigate them. With the right electrode and electrolyte design, we show that our pouch cells containing > 70 wt% SiOx can achieve 600-1,000 cycles at C/3 and meet projected energy targets of 700 Wh/L and 350 Wh/kg. These results provide a practical reference for research teams seeking to advance silicon-anode development using accessible materials.

Global warming presents an unprecedented challenge to our planet however comprehensive understanding remains hindered by geographical biases temporal limitations and lack of standardization in existing research. An end to end visual analysis of global warming using three distinct temperature datasets is presented. A baseline adjusted from the Paris Agreements one point five degrees Celsius benchmark based on data analysis is employed. A closed loop design from visualization to prediction and clustering is created using classic models tailored to the characteristics of the data. This approach reduces complexity and eliminates the need for advanced feature engineering. A lightweight convolutional neural network and long short term memory model specifically designed for global temperature change is proposed achieving exceptional accuracy in long term forecasting with a mean squared error of three times ten to the power of negative six and an R squared value of zero point nine nine nine nine. Dynamic time warping and KMeans clustering elucidate national level temperature anomalies and carbon emission patterns. This comprehensive method reveals intricate spatiotemporal characteristics of global temperature variations and provides warming trend attribution. The findings offer new insights into climate change dynamics demonstrating that simplicity and precision can coexist in environmental analysis.

Nordic skiing provides fascinating opportunities for mathematical modelling studies that exploit methods and insights from physics, applied mathematics, data analysis, scientific computing and sports science. A typical ski course winds over varied terrain with frequent changes in elevation and direction, and so its geometry is naturally described by a three-dimensional space curve. The skier travels along a course under the influence of various forces, and their dynamics can be described using a nonlinear system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that are derived from Newton's laws of motion. We develop an algorithm for solving the governing equations that combines Hermite spline interpolation, numerical quadrature and a high-order ODE solver. Numerical simulations are compared with measurements of skiers on actual courses to demonstrate the effectiveness of the model. Throughout, we aim to illustrate how elementary concepts from undergraduate courses in calculus and scientific computing can be applied to study real problems in sport, which we hope will provide stimulating examples for both instructors and students. At the same time, we demonstrate how these concepts are capable of providing novel insights into skiing that should also be of interest to sport scientists.

Circularly polarized light offers opportunities to probe symmetry-dependent properties of matter such as chirality and spin. Circular dichroism measurements typically require further intrinsic or extrinsic breaking of symmetry by e.g. enantiomeric excess, orientation, magnetic fields or direction-sensitive detectors. Here we introduce circular-dichroic attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy by leveraging the angular momentum of two circular-polarized pulses, both pump and probe, in an isotropic medium, optically orienting the angular momentum of excited states on an attosecond timescale. We investigate a circular-dichroic measurement of the attosecond transient absorption of He Rydberg states. By limiting the allowed pathways via dipole selection rules for co- and counter-rotating circular polarized NIR and XUV pulses, different spectral reshapings of the XUV transient absorption due to the AC Stark effect are observed. Paired with time-dependent Schrödinger equation calculations, the results show the role of selection and propensity rules and open up new opportunities to study coupling pathways of excited states as well as spin-dependent dynamics in atoms and beyond via attosecond optical orientation.

Achieving a high population of antihydrogen/hydrogen atoms in the 2S level is essential for spectroscopy measurements testing similarities between matter and antimatter. We propose and examine the efficiency of applying the STIRAP (Stimulated Raman Adiabatic Passage) process in achieving high population transfer from the 1S to the 2S levels. We utilized a circularly polarized Lyman alpha, Ly-$\alpha$, pulse to couple the 1S state to the 2P state and a microwave pulse to couple the 2P state and the 2S state. We calculate the efficiency of the STIRAP process for transferring the population between the stretched states $(1S_d, 2S_d)$ as a function of experimental parameters such as Rabi frequencies and pulse durations. We find that a Ly-$\alpha$ pulse with an energy of a few nanojoules could produce nearly perfect transfer at zero detunings for atoms on the laser beam axis. We extended the analysis to a thermal ensemble of atoms, where Doppler detuning affects the velocity distribution of the hydrogen atoms produced in the 2S level. We found that the width of such velocity distribution is controlled by the Rabi frequency. We show that the peak velocity of the hydrogen atoms in the 2S level after STIRAP can be controlled by the Ly-$\alpha$ pulse detuning. The efficiency of STIRAP in transferring population increases at low temperature (T$\sim$1~mK). Finally, we show that a background magnetic field improves the transfer rates between the other trappable states $(1S_c, 2S_c)$.

Combining physics education and machine learning research to measure evidence of students' mechanistic sensemaking

Subjects:
Physics Education (physics.ed-ph); Machine Learning (cs.LG)
Advances in machine learning (ML) offer new possibilities for science education research. We report on early progress in the design of an ML-based tool to analyze students' mechanistic sensemaking, working from a coding scheme that is aligned with previous work in physics education research (PER) and amenable to recently developed ML classification strategies using language encoders. We describe pilot tests of the tool, in three versions with different language encoders, to analyze sensemaking evident in college students' written responses to brief conceptual questions. The results show, first, that the tool's measurements of sensemaking can achieve useful agreement with a human coder, and, second, that encoder design choices entail a tradeoff between accuracy and computational expense. We discuss the promise and limitations of this approach, providing examples as to how this measurement scheme may serve PER in the future. We conclude with reflections on the use of ML to support PER research, with cautious optimism for strategies of co-design between PER and ML.

On the Derivation of the Cosmological Gurzadyan's Theorem
Trung V. Phan
Subjects:
Classical Physics (physics.class-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
In cosmology, the Gurzadyan's theorem identifies the most general force law consistent with the finding of Newton's first shell theorem -- that a spherical symmetric mass exerts the same gravitational force as a point mass at its center. This theorem has found important applications in cosmological modeling, particularly in the context of MoND (Modified Newtonian Dynamics), which has recently gained renewed attention as a potential alternative to dark matter. The derivation by Gurzadyan is written in an extremely concise and dense style, making it difficult to follow. Recent proofs of the theorem based on power-series methods offer valuable perspectives, though they differ from the original derivation, which is based on perturbation analysis. Our note aims to clarify the underlying logic in a pedagogical way -- accessible to advanced high school or undergraduate students -- while preserving conceptual clarity and mathematical elegance of his insight.

Multi-scale analysis of flow over heterogeneous urban environments
Maarten van Reeuwijk, Jingzi Huang
Subjects:
Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
A computationally efficient multi-scale planar-averaging framework for urban areas is developed, which enables efficient computation of coarse-grained velocity and scalar fields. We apply the multi-scale framework to a large-eddy simulation of an idealised heterogeneous urban environment of 512 buildings based on a typical London height distribution. We observe that for this geometry, the characteristic urban lengthscale $\ell \approx$ 50 m, which is the averaging lengthscale L at which as much variance in the mean flow is resolved as is unresolved. For $L>400$ m, the statistics become approximately homogeneous, suggesting that non-building-resolving numerical weather prediction (NWP) models can be applied without modification at resolutions of 400 m and above for the case under consideration. We derive the multi-scale plane- and Reynolds-averaged momentum equation and show that for neutral cases, NWP models require parameterisation of the distributed drag and the unresolved turbulence and dispersive stress. An a priori analysis reveals that the drag parameterisation from Sutzl et al. 2020, Bound-Layer Meteorol., 178:225-248 holds reasonably well for resolutions $L$ above 200 m. Below this value, the problem becomes inhomogeneous and the parameterisation works less well. The unresolved stresses are well represented by a $k-\omega$ closure with a value of $\omega=0.4/s$. However, an even more accurate closure can be derived from the Sutzl drag parameterisation that does not require further turbulence information.

Effective interface forces to model boundary effects in a finite-size metamaterial through the reduced relaxed micromorphic model
Plastiras Demetriou, Jendrik Voss, Angela Madeo
Subjects:
Applied Physics (physics.app-ph)
We use the reduced relaxed micromorphic model (RRMM) to capture the effective "bulk" dynamical response of finite size metamaterial specimens made out of a Labyrinthine unit cell. We show that for small finite-size specimens, boundary effects can play a major role, so that the RRMM needs an enrichment to capture the metamaterial's bulk response, as well as the boundary effects. A benchmark test is introduced to show that different metamaterial/ homogeneous material interfaces can drive completely different responses even if the bulk metamaterial remains the same. We show with no remaining doubts that the concept of "interface forces" must necessarily be introduced if one wants to model finite-size metamaterials in a homogenized framework.

Atomic precision advanced manufacturing (APAM) dopes silicon with enough carriers to change its electronic structure, and can be used to create novel devices by defining metallic regions whose boundaries have single-atom abruptness. Incompatibility with the thermal and lithography process requirements for gated silicon transistor manufacturing have inhibited exploration of both how APAM can enhance CMOS performance, and how transistor manufacturing steps can accelerate the discovery of new APAM device concepts. In this work, we introduce an APAM process that enables direct integration into the middle of a transistor manufacturing workflow. We show that a process that combines sputtering and annealing with a hardmask preserves a defining characteristic of APAM, a doping density far in excess of the solid solubility limit, while trading another, the atomic precision, for compatibility with manufacturing. The electrical characteristics of a chip combining a transistor with an APAM resistor show the APAM module has only affected the transistor through the addition of a resistance, and not by altering the transistor. This proof-of-concept demonstration also outlines the requirements and limitations of a unified APAM tool which could be introduced into manufacturing environments, greatly expanding access to this technology, and inspiring a new generation of devices with it.

Critical point search and linear response theory for computing electronic excitation energies of molecular systems. Part I: General framework, application to Hartree-Fock and DFT

Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
Computing excited states of many-body quantum Hamiltonians is a fundamental challenge in computational physics and chemistry, with state-of-the-art methods broadly classified into variational (critical point search) and linear response approaches. The Kähler manifold formalism provides a uniform framework which naturally accommodates both strategies for a wide range of variational models, including Hartree-Fock, CASSCF, Full CI, and adiabatic TDDFT. In particular, this formalism leads to a systematic and straightforward way to obtain the final equations of linear response theory for nonlinear models, which provides, in the case of mean-field models (Hartree-Fock and DFT), a simple alternative to Casida's derivation. We detail the mathematical structure of Hamiltonian dynamics on Kähler manifolds, establish connections to standard quantum chemistry equations, and provide theoretical and numerical comparisons of excitation energy computation schemes at the Hartree-Fock level.

In preparation for HL-LHC operation, a number of new detector systems are being constructed with timing precision on physics objects of $\leq50$ picoseconds. These time stamps will reduce the level of pileup induced backgrounds as the number of interactions per crossing will reach of order 100-200\cite{Shiltsev}.
In this report we note that this high pileup level will necessitate a new approach to calibration of these large timing arrays (typically with several $\times10^5$ channels) . Since the usual tools required for walk correction (a single t$_{0}$ reference and tracking) may not be readily available on Day-1, an initial calibration technique using only data internal to the timing array would be a benefit.
We demonstrate that enhancing the usual pair of timing ASIC data (ie threshold time and amplitude or time-over-threshold) with a 2nd threshold time greatly simplifies the analysis of amplitude walk. Walk dependence on the slope at threshold (derived from the two thresholds) is quite generally given by a single linear expression. Furthermore the Amplitude Walk Coefficient (AWC) can usually be determined in advance, as we will show.
While this technique results in calibration precision equivalent to the familiar brute force technique it should be emphasized that it is applicable when the tools required for the latter technique are not available.

Topological Control of Chirality and Spin with Structured Light
Light Mkhumbuza, Pedro Ornelas, Angela Dudley, Isaac Nape, Kayn A. Forbes
Subjects:
Optics (physics.optics)
Structured light beams with engineered topological properties offer a powerful means to control spin angular momentum (SAM) and optical chirality, key quantities shaped by spin-orbit interaction (SOI) in light. Such effects are typically regarded as emerging only through light-matter interactions. Here, we show that higher-order Poincaré modes, carrying a tunable Pancharatnam topological charge $\ell_p$, enable precise control of SOI purely from the intrinsic topology of the light field, without requiring any material interface. In doing so, we reveal a free-space paraxial optical Hall effect, where modulation of $\ell_p$ drives spatial separation of circular polarization states - a direct signature of SOI in a regime previously thought immune to such behaviour. Our analysis identifies two propagation-induced topological mechanisms underlying this effect: differential Gouy phase shifts between orthogonal components, and radial divergence of the beam envelope. These results overturn the common view that spin-orbit effects in free space require non-paraxial conditions, and establish a broadly tunable route to generating and controlling chirality and SAM without tight focusing. This approach provides new opportunities for optical manipulation, chiral sensing, and high-dimensional photonic information processing.

Topological Localisation in Time from PT Symmetry

Subjects:
Optics (physics.optics)
Time has entered the domain of topological phases in the field of non-Hermitian physics. Previous studies have relied on periodic modulation in time to make an intuitive connection to established spatial topological invariants, albeit with energy and momentum exchanged. This connection has revealed the potential for topological interface states along the time axis, analogous to those in spatial models. In this work, we uncover a theoretical framework describing such topological interface states along the time axis, with no underlying connection to spatial models nor need for periodic driving. This new framework uncovers that this phenomenon -- the robust localisation of waves at an interface -- appears in every system that has parity-time symmetry and two levels or bands, regardless of its spatial dimensionality. The topological nature of this localisation is understood by the identification of certain topological phases that are specific to parity-time symmetric models of two levels. Our results set out the first approach to identifying topological effects intrinsically linked to time and showcase the universal nature of such effects.

Farmed landscapes provide a natural laboratory to test how management reshapes near-surface hydrodynamics. Combining distributed acoustic sensing with physics-based hydromechanical modeling, we tracked minute-resolution, meter-scale changes across experimental fields with controlled tillage and compaction histories. We find that dynamic capillary effects, rate-dependent suction stresses during wetting and drying, govern transient stiffness and moisture redistribution in disturbed soils, producing sharp post-rain velocity drops from near-surface saturation and large hysteretic velocity rebounds driven by evapotranspiration. By pairing a seismic rainfall proxy with a drainage closure, we invert velocity changes to estimate evapotranspiration, revealing how disturbance alters flux partitioning and storage. These results establish agroseismology as a non-invasive, extendable tool to uncover soil hydromechanics, explain why conventional farming intensifies variability, and provide new constraints for Earth system models, land management, and hazard resilience.

We are investigating deterministic SIS dynamics on large networks starting from only a few infected individuals. Under mild assumptions we show that any two epidemic curves - on the same network and with the same parameters - are almost identical up to time translation when initial conditions are small enough regardless of how infections are distributed at the beginning. The limit object - an epidemic starting from the infinite past with infinitesimal prevalence - is identified as the nontrivial eternal solution connecting the disease free state with the endemic equilibrium. Our framework covers several benchmark models including the N-Intertwined Mean Field Approximation (NIMFA) and the Inhomogeneous Mean Field Approximation (IMFA).

When navigating complex environments, animals often combine multiple strategies to mitigate the effects of external disturbances. These modalities often correspond to different sources of information, leading to speed-accuracy trade-offs. Inspired by the intermittent reorientation strategy seen in the behavior of the dung beetle, we consider the problem of the navigation strategy of a correlated random walker moving in two dimensions. We assume that the heading of the walker can be reoriented to the preferred direction by paying a fixed cost as it tries to maximize its total displacement in a fixed direction. Using optimal control theory, we derive analytically and confirm numerically the strategy that maximizes the walker's speed, and show that the average time between reorientations scales inversely with the magnitude of the environmental noise. We then extend our framework to describe execution errors and sensory acquisition noise. As a result, we provide a range of testable predictions and suggest new experimental directions. Our approach may be amenable to other navigation problems involving multiple sensory modalities that require switching between egocentric and geocentric strategies.

Sensing environmental physical interaction to traverse cluttered obstacles

The long-standing, dominant approach to robotic obstacle negotiation relies on mapping environmental geometry to avoid obstacles. However, this approach does not allow for traversal of cluttered obstacles, hindering applications such as search and rescue operations through earthquake rubble and exploration across lunar and Martian rocks. To overcome this challenge, robots must further sense and utilize environmental physical interactions to control themselves to traverse obstacles. Recently, a physics-based approach has been established towards this vision. Self-propelled robots interacting with obstacles results in a potential energy landscape. On this landscape, to traverse obstacles, a robot must escape from certain landscape basins that attract it into failure modes, to reach other basins that lead to successful modes. Thus, sensing the potential energy landscape is crucial. Here, we developed new methods and performed systematic experiments to demonstrate that the potential energy landscape can be estimated by sensing environmental physical interaction. We developed a minimalistic robot capable of sensing obstacle contact forces and torques for systematic experiments over a wide range of parameter space. Surprisingly, although these forces and torques are not fully conservative, they match the potential energy landscape gradients that are conservative forces and torques, enabling an accurate estimation of the potential energy landscape. Additionally, a bio-inspired strategy further enhanced estimation accuracy. Our results provided a foundation for further refining these methods for use in free-locomoting robots. Our study is a key step in establishing a new physics-based approach for robots to traverse clustered obstacles to advance their mobility in complex, real-world environments.

Efficient cosmic ray generator for particle detector simulations

Traditional cosmic ray simulations make use of the Montecarlo method in a very naive way to randomise energy and direction for each simulated particle. The flux of cosmic rays is modelled as a rain coming from a plane above the object of interest (detectors in particle physics applications, planes in dosimetry studies, etc.) with an experimental angular and energy distributions. This strategy is very inefficient because many of the particles never touch the detector. Here a refined way of implementing the Montecarlo method is proposed in order to generate a sample of events that hit the target volume whose angular distribution coincides with the one from the naive implementation. It is based on the projection of a sphere containing the target volume onto a plane tangent to it with a fixed angle, we call it the secant method. This configuration allows to compute the probability of a cosmic particle hitting the sphere with this incoming angle as proportional to the area of the corresponding section of a cylinder. The performance of this method is faster in terms of computing time and identical physical results are achieved. It has been implemented in REST-for-Physics framework and it is tested with the geometry of a real detector, the IAXO-D0 Micromegas X-ray detector for the future axion helioscope BabyIAXO. Our method is 37 times more efficient than the traditional Montecarlo schema for the same accuracy, being more useful when the target volume departs from spherical shape

Approximating the ground state of many-body systems is a key computational bottleneck underlying important applications in physics and chemistry. The most widely known quantum algorithm for ground state approximation, quantum phase estimation, is out of reach of current quantum processors due to its high circuit-depths. Subspace-based quantum diagonalization methods offer a viable alternative for pre- and early-fault-tolerant quantum computers. Here, we introduce a quantum diagonalization algorithm which combines two key ideas on quantum subspaces: a classical diagonalization based on quantum samples, and subspaces constructed with quantum Krylov states. We prove that our algorithm converges in polynomial time under the working assumptions of Krylov quantum diagonalization and sparseness of the ground state. We then demonstrate the scalability of our approach by performing the largest ground-state quantum simulation of impurity models using a Heron quantum processors and the Frontier supercomputer. We consider both the single-impurity Anderson model with 41 bath sites, and a system with 4 impurities and 7 bath sites per impurity. Our results are in excellent agreement with Density Matrix Renormalization Group calculations.

We present a novel technique to incorporate precision calculations from quantum chromodynamics into fully differential particle-level Monte-Carlo simulations. By minimizing an information-theoretic quantity subject to constraints, our reweighted Monte Carlo incorporates systematic uncertainties absent in individual Monte Carlo predictions, achieving consistency with the theory input in precision and its estimated systematic uncertainties. Our method can be applied to arbitrary observables known from precision calculations, including multiple observables simultaneously. It generates strictly positive weights, thus offering a clear path to statistically powerful and theoretically precise computations for current and future collider experiments. As a proof of concept, we apply our technique to event-shape observables at electron-positron colliders, leveraging existing precision calculations of thrust. Our analysis highlights the importance of logarithmic moments of event shapes, which have not been previously studied in the collider physics literature.

In a scenario of growing usage of park-and-ride facilities, understanding and predicting car park occupancy is becoming increasingly important. This study presents a model that effectively captures the occupancy patterns of park-and-ride car parks for commuters using truncated normal distributions for vehicle arrival and departure times. The objective is to develop a predictive model with minimal parameters corresponding to commuter behaviour, enabling the estimation of parking saturation and unfulfilled demand. The proposed model successfully identifies the regular, periodic nature of commuter parking behaviour, where vehicles arrive in the morning and depart in the afternoon. It operates using aggregate data, eliminating the need for individual tracking of arrivals and departures. The model's predictive and now-casting capabilities are demonstrated through real-world data from car parks in the Barcelona Metropolitan Area. A simple model extension furthermore enables the prediction of when a car park will reach its occupancy limit and estimates the additional spaces required to accommodate such excess demand. Thus, beyond forecasting, the model serves as a valuable tool for evaluating interventions, such as expanding parking capacity, to optimize park-and-ride facilities.

Classical simulation of a programmable quantum processor is crucial in identifying the threshold of a quantum advantage. We demonstrate the simple update of projected entangled-pair states (PEPSs) in the Vidal gauge that represent random quantum circuit states, which center around recent quantum advantage claims. Applied to square lattices of qubits akin to state-of-the-art superconducting processors, the PEPS representation is exact for circuit depths less than $\mathcal{D}_\mathrm{tr}$ = $\beta\log_2\chi$, where $\chi$ is the maximum bond dimension and $2 \lesssim \beta \lesssim 4$ depends on the choice of two-qubit gates, independent of the qubit number $n$. We find the universal scaling behaviors of the state fidelity by treating large-scale circuits of $n \leq 10^{4}$, using $\chi \leq 128$ on a conventional CPU. Our method has a polynomial scaling of computational costs with $n$ for circuit depth $\mathcal{D}=O(\log n)$ and is more advantageous than matrix product state approaches if $n$ is large. This work underscores PEPSs as a scalable tool for benchmarking quantum algorithms with future potential for sampling applications using advanced contraction techniques.

How to be an orthodox quantum mechanic

Subjects:

This work sets out to answer a single question: what is the orthodox interpretation of quantum mechanics? However, we adopt a different approach to that normally used. Rather than surveying physicists, or poring over the precise details of the thoughts of Bohr and Heisenberg, we review a collection of 42 textbooks on quantum mechanics, encompassing the most popular and prominent works of this nature. We then gauge their response to 12 propositions to build up a picture of exactly what is believed by an orthodox quantum mechanic. We demonstrate that this orthodoxy has many aspects of Copenhagen-like viewpoints, but also shows some interesting emerging deviations. Moreover, it is more nuanced than some reductive characterisations that condense the orthodoxy down to the ontological primacy of the quantum state. The revealed orthodoxy has two consistent pillars: measurement inherently disturbs quantum states and these states refer to individual instances, not ensembles. More fully, it entails that individual particles exist in wave-like super-positions and present particle behaviours only when forced to by outside influences. The act of measuring such a system inherently induces random changes in its state, manifesting as a form of measurement error that corresponds to the uncertainty principle. This implies that measurement does not reveal underlying values of quantum properties.

Self-gravity in thin protoplanetary discs: 1. The smoothing-length approximation versus the exact self-gravity kernel

Planet-forming discs often contain structures like spiral arms, typically linked to the disc's gravitational forces. In 2D models, an ad hoc softening prescription is commonly used for self-gravity, but this overlooks the vertical structure's impact, suppresses the Newtonian nature of gravity at short distances and doesn't respect Newton's third law.
To address these issues, associated with a Plummer potential approximation, we developed an exact self-gravity kernel for thin, hydrostatically supported discs, including a dust fluid component. Our analytical framework provides a precise 2D self-gravity prescription validated by benchmarks and 2D/3D numerical tests.
The derived kernel, based on modified Bessel functions, maintains Newtonian gravitation features, such as point-wise symmetry, a smooth transition from light to massive discs and a singularity at zero distance, among others. In contrast to other prescriptions found in the literature, it proves capable of leading to an additional, and previously unnoticed, source of gravitational runaway discernible only at infinitesimal distances.
We finally note that our new prescription remains compatible with methods based on the fast Fourier transform, affording superior computational efficiency. Our exact kernel formulation overcomes substantial limitations inherent in the smoothing-length approach. It permits a novel, fully consistent treatment of self-gravity in Gaussian-stratified thin discs. The approach, that makes the usage of the Plummer potential obsolete, will prove useful to studying all common planet formation scenarios, which are often backed by 2D-flat numerical simulations. Accordingly, in an accompanying paper, we will investigate how the occurence of the gravitational instability is affected.

Parametrized Quantum Circuit Learning for Quantum Chemical Applications

In the field of quantum machine learning (QML), parametrized quantum circuits (PQCs) -- constructed using a combination of fixed and tunable quantum gates -- provide a promising hybrid framework for tackling complex machine learning problems. Despite numerous proposed applications, there remains limited exploration of datasets relevant to quantum chemistry. In this study, we investigate the potential benefits and limitations of PQCs on two chemically meaningful datasets: (1) the BSE49 dataset, containing bond separation energies for 49 different classes of chemical bonds, and (2) a dataset of water conformations, where coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) wavefunctions are predicted from lower-level electronic structure methods using the data-driven coupled-cluster (DDCC) approach. We construct a comprehensive set of 168 PQCs by combining 14 data encoding strategies with 12 variational ans{ä}tze, and evaluate their performance on circuits with 5 and 16 qubits. Our initial analysis examines the impact of circuit structure on model performance using state-vector simulations. We then explore how circuit depth and training set size influence model performance. Finally, we assess the performance of the best-performing PQCs on current quantum hardware, using both noisy simulations ("fake" backends) and real quantum devices. Our findings underscore the challenges of applying PQCs to chemically relevant problems that are straightforward for classical machine learning methods but remain non-trivial for quantum approaches.

The possibility of extracting energy from a rotating black hole via the Blandford-Znajek mechanism represents a cornerstone of relativistic astrophysics. We present general-relativistic collisionless kinetic simulations of Kerr black-hole magnetospheres covering a wide range in the black-hole spin. Considering a classical split-monopole magnetic field, we can reproduce with these ab-initio calculations the force-free electrodynamics of rotating black holes and measure the power of the jet launched as a function of the spin. The Blandford-Znajek luminosity we find is in very good agreement with analytic calculations and compatible with general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations via a simple rescaling. These results provide strong evidence of the robustness of the Blandford-Znajek mechanism and accurate estimates of the electromagnetic luminosity to be expected in those scenarios involving rotating black holes across the mass scale.

Title:

Neutron-antineutron oscillation (nnbar-osc) is a baryon-number-violating process and a sensitive probe for physics beyond the Standard Model. Ultra-cold neutrons (UCNs) are attractive for nnbar-osc searches because of their long storage time, but earlier analyses indicated that phase shifts on wall reflection differ for neutron and antineutron, leading to severe decoherence and loss of sensitivity. Here we revisit this problem by numerically solving the time-dependent Schroedinger equation for the two-component n/nbar wave function, explicitly including wall interactions. We show that decoherence can be strongly suppressed by selecting a wall material whose neutron and antineutron optical potentials are nearly equal. Using coherent scattering length data and estimates for antineutrons, we identify a Ni-Al alloy composition that matches the potentials within a few percent while providing a high absolute value, enabling long UCN storage. With such a bottle and an improved UCN source, the sensitivity could reach an oscilla-tion period tau_nnbar of order 10^10 s, covering most of the range predicted by certain grand-unified models. This approach revives the feasibility of high-sensitivity nnbar-osc searches using stored UCNs and offers a clear path to probe baryon-number violation far beyond existing limits.

Title:
Fast Unbiased Sampling of Networks with Given Expected Degrees and Strengths

The configuration model is a cornerstone of statistical assessment of network structure. While the Chung-Lu model is among the most widely used configuration models, it systematically oversamples edges between large-degree nodes, leading to inaccurate statistical conclusions. Although the maximum entropy principle offers unbiased configuration models, its high computational cost has hindered widespread adoption, making the Chung-Lu model an inaccurate yet persistently practical choice. Here, we propose fast and efficient sampling algorithms for the max-entropy-based models by adapting the Miller-Hagberg algorithm. Evaluation on 103 empirical networks demonstrates 10-1000 times speedup, making theoretically rigorous configuration models practical and contributing to a more accurate understanding of network structure.

Title:
Unified Spatiotemporal Physics-Informed Learning (USPIL): A Framework for Modeling Complex Predator-Prey Dynamics

Comments:
20 pages, 11 figures. A preprint on using a unified physics-informed neural network framework to model predator-prey dynamics

Ecological systems exhibit complex multi-scale dynamics that challenge traditional modeling. New methods must capture temporal oscillations and emergent spatiotemporal patterns while adhering to conservation principles. We present the Unified Spatiotemporal Physics-Informed Learning (USPIL) framework, a deep learning architecture integrating physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and conservation laws to model predator-prey dynamics across dimensional scales. The framework provides a unified solution for both ordinary (ODE) and partial (PDE) differential equation systems, describing temporal cycles and reaction-diffusion patterns within a single neural network architecture. Our methodology uses automatic differentiation to enforce physics constraints and adaptive loss weighting to balance data fidelity with physical consistency. Applied to the Lotka-Volterra system, USPIL achieves 98.9% correlation for 1D temporal dynamics (loss: 0.0219, MAE: 0.0184) and captures complex spiral waves in 2D systems (loss: 4.7656, pattern correlation: 0.94). Validation confirms conservation law adherence within 0.5% and shows a 10-50x computational speedup for inference compared to numerical solvers. USPIL also enables mechanistic understanding through interpretable physics constraints, facilitating parameter discovery and sensitivity analysis not possible with purely data-driven methods. Its ability to transition between dimensional formulations opens new avenues for multi-scale ecological modeling. These capabilities make USPIL a transformative tool for ecological forecasting, conservation planning, and understanding ecosystem resilience, establishing physics-informed deep learning as a powerful and scientifically rigorous paradigm.
