Title:
Is 'Hope' a person or an idea? A pilot benchmark for NER: comparing traditional NLP tools and large language models on ambiguous entities
Payam Latifi
Comments:
14 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables. This is a pilot study evaluating six NER systems -- three traditional tools (NLTK, spaCy, Stanza) and three LLMs (Gemini-1.5-flash, DeepSeek-V3, Qwen-3-4B) -- on a small, ambiguity-rich dataset of 119 tokens. The annotated dataset, prompts are provided in appendices for full reproducibility. All experiments were conducted on 14 May 2025
