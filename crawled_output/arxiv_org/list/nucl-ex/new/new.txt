Title:
Elastic and Spin-Changing Cross Sections of Spin-Polarized Atomic Tritium
M. G. Elliott, B. J. P. Jones

The rates of elastic and inelastic scattering processes of spin-polarized atomic tritium are vital inputs for the design and operation of experiments using cold, magnetically trapped tritium atoms. Elastic scattering dominates the total cross section and dictates the thermophysical properties of the vapor, determining the efficiency of magnetic evaporative cooling and the fluid dynamical properties of the trapped atom cloud. Spin-changing cross sections in both exchange and dipolar channels determine the trap lifetime of the various hyperfine states, imposing constraints on the required atomic tritium supply rate to maintain a given trap density. Motivated by the needs of next-generation spectrometers that will study the tritium beta endpoint to infer the mass of the neutrino, we present new calculations of the elastic, spin-exchange and dipolar cross sections for spin polarized atomic tritium. Cross sections and rate constants are reported for magnetic field strengths of 0-10 T and temperatures from 0-100~K in all relevant Zeeman-hyperfine channels for both tritium and hydrogen. Results are bench-marked against past calculations for atomic hydrogen and the limited available results for tritium, and extend far into the regimes where past calculations have not been available.

Utilizing the 2012 transversely polarized proton data from the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at Brookhaven National Laboratory, the forward $\eta$-meson transverse single-spin asymmetry ($A_N$) was measured for $p^{\uparrow}+p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=200$ GeV as a function of Feynman-x ($x_F$) for $0.2<|x_F|<0.8$ and transverse momentum ($p_T$) for $1.0<p_T<5.0$ GeV/$c$. Large asymmetries at positive $x_F$ are observed ($\left<A_N\right>=0.086 \pm 0.019$), agreeing well with previous measurements of $\pi^{0}$ and $\eta$ $A_N$, but with reach to higher $x_F$ and $p_T$. The contribution of initial-state spin-momentum correlations to the asymmetry, as calculated in the collinear twist-3 framework, appears insufficient to describe the data and suggests a significant impact on the asymmetry from fragmentation.

The evolution of light theories began with Isaac Newton's corpuscular model, which explained reflection and refraction but could not account for diffraction and interference. In contrast, Christiaan Huygens proposed a wave theory, explaining light's behavior through an ether-based medium, supported by his principle that each point in a wavefront acts as a secondary source. This idea was experimentally supported in the early nineteenth century when Thomas Young's double-slit experiment revealed an interference pattern, affirming light's wave nature. Later, James Clerk Maxwell unified electricity and magnetism, establishing light as an electromagnetic wave and extending the electromagnetic spectrum beyond visible light. In the twentieth century, Einstein's photoelectric effect introduced the concept of wave-particle duality, demonstrating that light behaves as discrete photons. Soon after, Louis de Broglie extended the idea of wave-particle duality to matter, a prediction confirmed in 1927 when Clinton Davisson and Lester Germer observed electron diffraction from a crystal and, independently, G.P. Thomson demonstrated electron diffraction through thin films, both proving that electrons also exhibit wave-like properties. This concept was dramatically visualized by Claus Jonsson's 1961 electron double-slit experiment. Recently, the ALICE collaboration observed quantum interference patterns at the femtometer scale in ultra-relativistic nuclear collisions, pushing quantum interference studies to new frontiers.

Title:
Statistical research on determining sensitivity of neutrinoless double beta decays

The determination of experimental sensitivity is a key step in the search for neutrinoless double beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$), providing a quantitative benchmark for detector design. Two commonly used statistical approaches are the counting method, which estimates sensitivity from the number of events in a predefined region of interest (RoI), and the fitting method, which extracts the signal contribution by fitting the full energy spectrum. In this work, we investigate both discovery sensitivity and exclusion sensitivity within these two approaches. Through statistical derivation and simulation verification, we show that the relative performance of the methods depends on both energy resolution and exposure, while at higher exposures the fitting method consistently yields more stringent sensitivity. These results provide guidance for selecting the optimal statistical method in future $0\nu\beta\beta$ experiments.

The thermalization of quark-gluon plasma created in heavy-ion collisions is crucial for understanding its behavior as a relativistic fluid and the thermodynamic properties of the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). This study investigates the role of fluctuations in the relationship between transverse momentum and particle multiplicity, with a particular focus on their impact on extracting the QCD speed of sound. In a thermalized quark-gluon plasma, fluctuations are dominantly quantum in origin and follow a Gaussian distribution due to their independence from the thermodynamic response. In contrast, non-thermalized systems display non-Gaussian fluctuations, reflecting the breakdown of thermalization. By leveraging the Gaussianity condition of quantum fluctuations, the physical value of the speed of sound can be extracted statistically, even in the presence of significant event-by-event fluctuations. This framework provides a robust diagnostic tool for probing thermalization and extracting thermodynamic properties in both large and small collision systems.

Title:
Particle identification in the GlueX detector with machine learning

In particle physics experiments, identifying the types of particles registered in a detector is essential for the accurate reconstruction of particle collisions. At Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Lab), the GlueX experiment performs particle identification (PID) by setting specific thresholds, known as cuts, on the kinematic properties of tracks and showers obtained from detector hits. Our research aims to enhance this cut-based method by employing machine-learning algorithms based on multi-layer perceptrons and boosted decision trees. Similar approaches have been applied in other particle physics experiments and offer an opportunity to increase PID accuracies using reconstructed kinematic data. Our study illustrates that both multilayered perceptrons and boosted decision trees can identify charged and neutral particles in Monte Carlo simulated GlueX data with significantly improved accuracy over the current cuts-based PID method.
