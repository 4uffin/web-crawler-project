The $^{93}$Nb($t$,$^{3}$He) reaction at 115 MeV/u was studied to demonstrate that nuclear level densities and $\gamma$-ray strength functions can be extracted from charge-exchange reactions at intermediate energies using the Oslo technique. The matrix of excitation energy in $^{93}$Zr, reconstructed from the ($t$,$^{3}$He) reaction, versus the energy of $\gamma$ rays emitted by the excited $^{93}$Zr nuclei, was obtained in an experiment with the S800 Spectrograph operated in coincidence with the GRETINA $\gamma$-ray detector. The extracted level density and $\gamma$-ray strength function obtained by applying the Oslo method to this matrix were used to estimate the $^{92}$Zr($n$,$\gamma$)$^{93}$Zr cross section by combining the new results with other experimental data and theoretical calculations for $E$1 and $M$1 strength functions at higher energies. Good agreement with direct measurements of the $^{92}$Zr($n$,$\gamma$)$^{93}$Zr cross section was found. The contribution from the upbend in the extracted $\gamma$-ray strength function was important to achieve the consistency as the neutron-capture cross section without this contribution is significantly below the direct measurements otherwise. Since charge-exchange reactions at intermediate energies have long been used for extracting Gamow-Teller strengths, the successful demonstration of the charge-exchange Oslo method enables experiments in which ($n$,$\gamma$) cross sections and Gamow-Teller strengths can be measured simultaneously, which is of benefit for astrophysical studies.

Title:
A data-driven method to estimate contamination from light ion beam transmutation at colliders

Collisions of relativistic light ions such as oxygen, neon, and magnesium, have been proposed as way to examine the system-size dependence of dynamics typically associated with the quark-gluon plasma produced in collisions of heavier ions such as xenon, gold, or lead. Recent efforts at both the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider and Large Hadron Collider have produced large datasets of proton-oxygen, oxygen-oxygen, and neon-neon collisions, catalyzing intense interest in experimental backgrounds associated with light ion collisions. In particular, electromagnetic dissociation of light ions while they are circulating in a collider can result in beam contamination that is difficult to simulate precisely. Here we propose a data-driven method for evaluating the potential impact of beam contaminants on physics analyses. The method exploits the time-dependence and smaller size of contaminant ion species to define control regions that can be used to quantify potential contamination effects. A simple model is used to illustrate the method and to study its robustness. This method can inform studies of recent LHC and RHIC data and could also be useful for future light ion programs at the LHC and beyond.

Title:

The half-life of $^{39}$Ar is measured using the DEAP-3600 detector located 2 km underground at SNOLAB. Between 2016 and 2020, DEAP-3600 used a target mass of (3269 $\pm$ 24) kg of liquid argon distilled from the atmosphere in a direct-detection dark matter search. Such an argon mass also enables direct measurements of argon isotope properties. The decay of $^{39}$Ar in DEAP-3600 is the dominant source of triggers by two orders of magnitude, ensuring high statistics and making DEAP-3600 well-suited for measuring this isotope's half-life. Use of the pulse-shape discrimination technique in DEAP-3600 allows powerful discrimination between nuclear recoils and electron recoils, resulting in the selection of a clean sample of $^{39}$Ar decays. Observing over a period of 3.4 years, the $^{39}$Ar half-life is measured to be $(302 \pm 8_{\rm stat} \pm 6_{\rm sys})$ years. This new direct measurement suggests that the half-life of $^{39}$Ar is significantly longer than the accepted value, with potential implications for measurements using this isotope's half-life as input.

Incoherent J/$\psi$ photoproduction in heavy ion ultraperipheral collisions (UPCs) provides a sensitive probe of localized, fluctuating gluonic structures within heavy nuclei. This study reports the first measurement of the photon-nucleon center-of-mass energy ($W_{\gamma\mathrm{N}}$) dependence of this process in PbPb UPCs at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of 5.02 TeV, using 1.52 nb$^{-1}$ of data recorded by the CMS experiment. The measurement covers a wide $W_{\gamma\mathrm{N}}$ range of $\approx$ 40-400 GeV, probing gluons carrying a fraction $x$ of nucleon momentum down to an unexplored region of 6.5 $\times$ 10$^{-5}$. Compared to baseline predictions neglecting nuclear effects, the measured cross sections exhibit significantly greater suppression at lower $x$. Additionally, the ratio of incoherent to coherent photoproduction is found to be constant across the probed $W_{\gamma\mathrm{N}}$ and $x$ range, disfavoring the establishment of the black disk limit. This study provides critical insights into the $x$-dependent evolution of fluctuating gluonic structures within nuclei and calls for further advancements in theoretical models incorporating nuclear shadowing and gluon saturation.

The masses of neutron-rich $^{104-106}$Tc isotopes were measured using the JYFLTRAP double Penning trap and found to deviate from the Atomic Mass Evaluation 2020 by $-79(25)$, $40(12)$ and $94(41)$ keV, respectively. In the case of $^{105,106}$Tc, the updated $Q_\beta$ values are in agreement with a previous JYFLTRAP measurement, disagreeing with the values from the mass evaluation. The new mass values result in a more linear trend in two-neutron separation energies indicating that technetium ($Z=43$) isotopes around $N \approx 60$ are not a part of the island of shape coexistence around $^{100}$Zr$_{60}$.
