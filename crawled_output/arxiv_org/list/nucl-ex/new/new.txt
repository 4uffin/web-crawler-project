Title:
Towards a precise measurement of the $Λ_c^+/D^0$ ratio at RHIC
Joseph D. Osborn
Comments:
Proceedings for Quark Matter 2025
Subjects:

sPHENIX is a next-generation experiment at RHIC for jet and heavy-flavor physics which was fully commissioned during 2023 and 2024. Using its novel streaming-readout-capable, precision tracking system, sPHENIX collected 100 billion unbiased $p$$+$$p$ collisions, and a further sample of minimum-bias Au-Au collisions, in Run-24. A key measurement of the sPHENIX heavy flavor physics program is the comparison of $\Lambda_c^+$ to $D^0$ differential yields in both Au+Au and $p$$+$$p$ collisions, which probes questions related to the hadronization of heavy-flavor baryons compared to mesons in the Quark-Gluon Plasma medium and in vacuum. At RHIC energies, there is no previous measurement of the $\Lambda_c^+/D^0$ baseline in $p$$+$$p$ collisions, modern Monte Carlo event generators give widely different predictions, and the ratio in Au+Au is only poorly known. These proceedings present the status of measurement from sPHENIX of the $\Lambda_c^+/D^0$ ratio in $p$$+$$p$ collisions.

Title:
$A_β[E_β]$ in $^{37}$K decay: new physics with opposite $β$ helicity

By extending our analysis and simulations of our $^{37}$K $\beta$-decay data set to allow the $\beta$ asymmetry with respect to nuclear spin to vary with $\beta$ energy $E_{\beta}$, we have gained sensitivity to new physics that depends on a helicity factor for the $\beta$, $m_\beta/E_\beta$.
In particular, we constrain Lorentz scalar and tensor quark-lepton interaction strengths at a sensitivity complementary to the similar Fierz interference term in neutron $\beta$ decay.
Our result for that new physics is
$b_F$ = -0.0002 $\pm$ 0.024 (stat) $\pm$ 0.039 (syst),
consistent with the standard model electroweak interaction value $b_F=0$. We consider presently achieved complementarity to $\beta$-decay and particle physics experiments, along with projectable technical improvements to our method.

Title:
High-Precision Measurement of D($γ$, $n$)$p$ Photodisintegration Reaction and Implications for Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis

We report on a high-precision measurement of the D($\gamma$, $n$)$p$ photodisintegration reaction at the newly commissioned Shanghai Laser Electron Gamma Source (SLEGS), employing a quasi-monochromatic $\gamma$-ray beam from Laser Compton Scattering. The cross sections were determined over $E_\gamma$=2.327-7.089 MeV, achieving up to a factor of 2.2 improvement in precision near the neutron separation threshold. Combined with previous data in a global Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis using dibaryon effective field theory, we obtained the unprecedentedly precise $p$($n$, $\gamma$)D cross sections and thermonuclear rate, with a precision up to 3.8 times higher than previous evaluations. Implemented in a standard Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) framework, this new rate decreases uncertainty of the key cosmological parameter of baryon density $\Omega_b h^2$ by up to $\approx$16% relative to the LUNA result. A residual $\approx$1.2$\sigma$ tension between $\Omega_b h^2$ constrained from primordial D/H observations and CMB measurements persists, highlighting the need for improved $dd$ reaction rates and offering potential hints of new physics beyond the standard model of cosmology.

Title:
New probes of nuclear gluon dynamics through photoproduction of charm in inelastic ultra-peripheral Pb$\unicode{x2014}$Pb collisions with ALICE

In an ultra-peripheral collision, a photon can interact with a gluon in the target nucleus and produce a pair of charm quarks, while the target nucleus breaks up (inelastic scattering). These charm quarks then fragment and are observed as open charm hadrons or vector mesons. This process has been used in e$\unicode{x2014}$p collisions to set stringent limits on the proton gluon distribution at low-$x$. The current measurements can provide similar constraints on the much less known nuclear gluon distributions. ALICE has measured the transverse momentum distribution of inelastically photoproduced $\text{D}^0$ at midrapidity, in Pb$\unicode{x2014}$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\text{NN}}$=5.36 TeV. The distribution is measured down to $p_\text{T}$=0 for the first time. The results are compared to model calculations.

Title:
Glauber quark and gluon contributions to quark energy loss at next-to-leading order in the highly virtual regime

High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)
The higher-twist (HT) formalism is used at $O(\alpha^2_s)$ to compute all possible medium-induced single emission scattering kernels for an incoming highly virtual and energetic quark traversing the nuclear environment. The effects of the heavy-quark mass scale are taken into account [Phys. Rev. C 94, 054902 (2016)] both in the initial state as well as in the final state, along with interactions involving both in-medium Glauber gluons and quarks [Nucl. Phys. A 793, 128 (2007)], as well as coherence effects [Phys. Rev. C 105, 024908 (2022)]. As this study is a continuation of our work on medium-induced photon production [Phys. Rev. C 112, 025204 (2025)], the general factorization procedure for $e$-$A$ deep-inelastic scattering is still used. An incoming quark energy loss in the nuclear medium yields four possible scattering kernels $\it{K}_i$ with the following final states: (i) $q+g$, (ii) $\it{g}+\it{g}$, (iii) $q+\bar{q}'$, where the quark $q$ may have a flavor different from the antiquark $\bar{q}'$, and (iv) $q+q'$, where, again, $q$ may have a flavor different from $q'$. The collisional kernels include full phase factors from all non-vanishing diagrams and complete first-order derivative in the longitudinal direction ($k^-$) as well as second-order derivative in the transverse momentum ($k_{\perp}$) gradient expansion. Furthermore, in-medium parton distribution functions and the related jet transport coefficients have a hard transverse-momentum dependence (of the emitted quark or gluon) present within the phase factor.

Title:
Nuclear transitions on demand
C.-J. Yang
Comments:
7 pages, 4 figures, to appear in the Proceedings of the 14th Int. Spring Seminar on Nuclear Physics: "Cutting-edge developments in nuclear structure physics"
Subjects:
Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)
I show a way to tune photo-nuclear cross section effectively and therefore achieve nuclear transitions "on demand". The method is based on combinatorial enhancement of multiphoton processes under intense conditions. Taking advantage of recent advances in high-power laser systems (HPLS) and nuclear structure calculations, efficient control of nuclear transitions up to E4 in multipolarity can be reached today. The same idea can be extended to the search for rare transitions and hidden states, which applies to the $\gamma$-beams generated from conventional sources as well.

Nuclear physics is a very abstract field with little accessibility for wider audiences, and yet it is a field of physics with far reaching implications for everyday life. The Nuclear Beavers demonstration is a hands-on experience that offers an intuitive lens into nuclear structure and decay. We aim to provide a more accessible entry point for students and educators by substituting complex nuclear structures and interactions with tactile building blocks following well-defined rules, thereby opening nuclear physics concepts to the general public.

Title:
Shell Migration at N = 32, 34 around Ca Region

Comments:
This article is part of a review collection from the ''Symposium Direct reactions and spectroscopy with hydrogen targets: past 10 years at the RIBF and future prospects'', to be submitted to PTEP
Subjects:
Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)
The neutron numbers N = 32 and 34 are new magic numbers suggested in neutron-rich $pf$-shell nuclei. In this article, we discuss the experimental observables and state-of-the-art theoretical calculations that characterize and explain the shell evolution leading to new magic numbers. Particular focus shall be afforded to the experimental progress of the shell migration study at and beyond N = 32, 34 in Ar, K, Ca, and Sc isotopes at the RIBF using direct reactions with liquid hydrogen targets over the past ten years. The results prove the double magicity of \ts{52,54}Ca, and support the persistence of the N = 34 subshell closure below Z = 20 with a sharp weakening beyond Z = 20. Future measurements of intruder bands of N = 32, 34 nuclei and shell evolution towards N = 40 are discussed within the context of an upgraded RIBF facility and the development of novel detection systems.

Title:
UrQMD Simulations of Higher-order Cumulants in Au+Au Collisions at High Baryon Density

High moments of conserved quantities such as net-baryon, net-electric charge, and net-strangeness in heavy-ion collisions are sensitive to fluctuations caused by the QCD critical point (CP). The event-by-event analysis of high moments of the conserved charges has been widely used in experiments to search for the CP, especially in the RHIC-STAR experiment.
In order to establish a {\it dynamical non-critical base line}, especially at the high baryon density region, we have performed a systematic analysis of the proton multiplicity distributions from Au+Au collisions at 3 $\leq$ $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ $\leq$ 9.2 GeV collisions. The results on beam energy, centrality and rapidity width dependence of proton (factorial) cumulants, up to the $4^{th}$ order, are extracted from the calculations of the hadronic transport model UrQMD. In addition, the effects of initial volume fluctuation is also discussed. These results will be important when we do physics analysis the RHIC beam energy scan (BES) data, especially for the fixed-target data and experimental data from future CBM experiment at FAIR.

In stars that lie on the main sequence in the Hertzsprung-Russel diagram, like our sun, hydrogen is fused to helium in a number of nuclear reaction chains and series, such as the proton-proton chain and the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen cycles. Precisely determined thermonuclear rates of these reactions lie at the foundation of the standard solar model. This review, the third decadal evaluation of the nuclear physics of hydrogen-burning stars, is motivated by the great advances made in recent years by solar neutrino observatories, putting experimental knowledge of the proton-proton chain neutrino fluxes in the few-percent precision range. The basis of the review is a one-week community meeting held in July 2022 in Berkeley, California, and many subsequent digital meetings and exchanges. The relevant reactions of solar and stellar hydrogen burning are reviewed here, from both theoretical and experimental perspectives. Recommendations for the state of the art of the astrophysical S-factor and its uncertainty are formulated for each of them. Several other topics of paramount importance for the solar model are reviewed, as well: recent and future neutrino experiments, electron screening, radiative opacities, and current and upcoming experimental facilities. In addition to reaction-specific recommendations, also general recommendations are formed.

On the sensitivity of nuclear clocks to new physics

The recent demonstration of laser excitation of the $\approx 8$ eV isomeric state of Thorium-229 is a significant step towards a nuclear clock. The low excitation energy likely results from a cancellation between electromagnetic and strong contributions, which new physics can disrupt. In this Letter, we quantify the enhancement of a nuclear clock's sensitivity to new physics using a geometric model and a novel $d$-wave halo model of the nucleus that reproduces measured differences between Thorium-229 states. We find likely enhancements of order $10^4$ while a worst case scenario with enhancement $\ll 1$ is unlikely.

Title:
Phenomenological refinement of $p$-$d$ elastic scattering descriptions towards the 3NF study in nuclei via the ($p,pd$) reaction

The ($p,pd$) reaction is expected to be a powerful tool for probing three-nucleon forces (3NFs) in nuclear medium since it can be essentially regarded as the $p$-$d$ elastic scattering inside nuclei. One of the important points in the theoretical description of the ($p,pd$) reaction is to calculate the $p$-$d$ scattering in a nucleus quantitatively using effective interactions. This work aims to develop a phenomenological approach to improve the quantitativity of the $p$-$d$ scattering cross section in free space calculated with effective interactions. The $p$-$d$ elastic amplitude is decomposed into a 2N part, described using 2N effective interactions, and a residual part, which the 2N part cannot describe. The latter is approximated by a superposition of Legendre polynomials, with coefficients treated as adjustable parameters. These parameters are determined to reproduce experimental $p$-$d$ differential cross-section data at various incident energies. The obtained parameters exhibit smooth energy dependence, which is approximated by quadratic functions. The numerical results with the analytic energy dependence also reproduce the experimental data. The developed approach works well for improving the $p$-$d$ scattering cross section in a wide range of incident energies. This work can be regarded as the first step toward the description of ($p,pd$) reactions with taking 3NF effect in nuclear medium into account.
