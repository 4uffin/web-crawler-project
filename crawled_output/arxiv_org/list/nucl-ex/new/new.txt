The excitation scheme of the $^{69}$Ga ($Z = 31, N = 38$) nucleus has been studied following its population in $^{59}$Co($^{13}$C,2pn) reaction at $E_{lab} = 45, 50$ MeV, and using an array of Compton suppressed HPGe clover detectors as the detection system. The existing level scheme has been considerably extended with identification of new $\gamma$-ray transitions and their multipolarity assignments. The level energies have been calculated in the framework of the large basis shell model and their overlap with the experimental values has been satisfactory, subject to the choice of the interaction. The band structures identified in the nucleus have been characterized with the Moment of Inertia (MOI) and aligned angular momentum, and compared to those of the similar structures in the neighboring isotopes. The shapes corresponding to these bands have been probed in the light of their Total Routhian Surface (TRS) that exhibited varied deformation characteristics, such as prolate and $\gamma$-softness, associated with the individual sequences. Further, evidence of strong octupole correlation has been identified from an E3 transition between bands of opposite parities. The study comprehensively brings forth multiple aspects of single particle and collective characteristics in the level structure of $^{69}$Ga.

Title:

Purpose: We have investigated the cross section around the lowest direct coincident gamma-particle measurements, where previously only limits could be established with the aim of obtaining a detailed description of the excitation function. We have furthermore analysed the ratio of extreme decay branching into the first excited state of daughter nuclei with alpha or proton emission at relative kinetic energies where previous measurements are in disagreement with each other. Conclusions: Our findings in the astrophysics RoI support reaction-rate models with a lower average S-factor trend, that deviates significantly from standard extrapolations between 2.2 MeV and 2.6 MeV, for stellar carbon burning simulations of up to 25 Msol stars. Based on our data, an overall increase of the S-factor at deep subbarrier energy cannot be confirmed. The extremely low ratio of the branching into the first excited state with proton over alpha emission of ~ 2% at 3.23 MeV might indicate the presence of alpha cluster compound states in 24Mg. This highly favours {\alpha} emission with fundamental consequences in possible stellar carbon burning sites.

Title:
Secondary bow with ripples in $^{12}$C+$^{12}$C rainbow scattering

We report, {for the first time, the emergence of} a secondary bow with ripples in $^{12}$C+$^{12}$C nuclear rainbow scattering. This finding was achieved by studying the experimental angular distributions in $^{12}$C+$^{12}$C scattering at incident energies $E_L$= 240 and 300 MeV, utilizing an extended double-folding model. This model accurately describes all diagonal and off-diagonal coupling potentials derived from the microscopic wave functions for $^{12}$C. Although the observed angular distributions of rainbow scattering at large angles (approaching $90^\circ$) are complicated by the symmetrization of two identical bosonic nuclei, the Airy minimum, associated with a dynamically generated secondary bow with ripples, is clearly identified at approximately 77$^\circ$ for 240 MeV in the fall-off region of the primary nuclear rainbow. This {finding}, along with previous findings in the $^{16}$O+$^{12}$C and $^{13}$C+$^{12}$C systems, {reinforces} the concept of a secondary bow in nuclear rainbow scattering.

Title:
Extracting the Speed of Sound in Heavy-Ion Collisions: A Study of Quantum-Initiated Fluctuations and Thermalization

The thermalization of quark-gluon plasma created in heavy-ion collisions is crucial for understanding its behavior as a relativistic fluid and the thermodynamic properties of the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). This study investigates the role of fluctuations in the relationship between transverse momentum and particle multiplicity, with a particular focus on their impact on extracting the QCD speed of sound. In a thermalized quark-gluon plasma, these fluctuations mostly originate from quantum fluctuations in the colliding nuclei, and exhibit a Gaussian distribution as a consequence of their independence from thermodynamic response. In contrast, non-thermalized systems display non-Gaussian fluctuations, reflecting the breakdown of thermalization. By leveraging the Gaussianity condition of quantum-initiated fluctuations, the physical value of the speed of sound can be extracted statistically, even in the presence of significant event-by-event fluctuations. This framework provides a robust diagnostic tool for probing thermalization and extracting thermodynamic properties in both large and small collision systems.

Title:
Amplitude Walk in Fast Timing: The Role of Dual Thresholds

In preparation for HL-LHC operation, a number of new detector systems are being constructed with timing precision on physics objects of $\leq50$ picoseconds. These time stamps will reduce the level of pileup induced backgrounds as the number of interactions per crossing will reach of order 100-200\cite{Shiltsev}.
In this report we note that this high pileup level will necessitate a new approach to calibration of these large timing arrays (typically with several $\times10^5$ channels) . Since the usual tools required for walk correction (a single t$_{0}$ reference and tracking) may not be readily available on Day-1, an initial calibration technique using only data internal to the timing array would be a benefit.
We demonstrate that enhancing the usual pair of timing ASIC data (ie threshold time and amplitude or time-over-threshold) with a 2nd threshold time greatly simplifies the analysis of amplitude walk. Walk dependence on the slope at threshold (derived from the two thresholds) is quite generally given by a single linear expression. Furthermore the Amplitude Walk Coefficient (AWC) can usually be determined in advance, as we will show.
While this technique results in calibration precision equivalent to the familiar brute force technique it should be emphasized that it is applicable when the tools required for the latter technique are not available.
