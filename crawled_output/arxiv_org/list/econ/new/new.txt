Title:
Linear fractional relative risk aversion
Kristian Behrens, Yasusada Murata
Comments:
63 pages, 0 figures
Subjects:
General Economics (econ.GN)
We characterize the family of utility functions satisfying linear fractional relative risk aversion (LFRRA) in terms of the Gauss hypergeometric functions. We apply this family, which nests various utility functions used in different strands of literature, to monopolistic competition and obtain a closed-form solution for the profit-maximizing price by generalizing the Lambert W function. We let firm-level data decide whether the RRA in each sector or in the aggregate economy is increasing, decreasing, or constant, which in turn determines whether markups are decreasing, increasing, or constant with respect to marginal costs.

Title:
Robo-Advisors Beyond Automation: Principles and Roadmap for AI-Driven Financial Planning
Runhuan Feng, Hong Li, Ming Liu
Comments:
37 pages, 2 figures
Subjects:
General Economics (econ.GN)
Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming financial planning by expanding access, lowering costs, and enabling dynamic, data-driven advice. Yet without clear safeguards, digital platforms risk reproducing longstanding market inefficiencies such as information asymmetry, misaligned incentives, and systemic fragility. This paper develops a framework for responsible AI in financial planning, anchored in five principles: fiduciary duty, adaptive personalization, technical robustness, ethical and fairness constraints, and auditability. We illustrate these risks and opportunities through case studies, and extend the framework into a five-level roadmap of AI financial intermediaries. By linking technological design to economic theory, we show how AI can either amplify vulnerabilities or create more resilient, trustworthy forms of financial intermediation.

Title:
Price Formation in a Highly-Renewable, Sector-Coupled Energy System
Julian Geis, Fabian Neumann, Michael Lindner, Philipp Härtel, Tom Brown
Subjects:
General Economics (econ.GN)
As variable renewable energy increases and more demand is electrified, we expect price formation in wholesale electricity markets to transition from being dominated by fossil fuel generators to being dominated by the opportunity costs of storage and demand management. In order to analyse this transition, we introduce a new method to investigate price formation based on a mapping from the dual variables of the energy system optimisation problem to the bids and asks of electricity suppliers and consumers. This allows us to build the full supply and demand curves in each hour. We use this method to analyse price formation in a sector-coupled, climate-neutral energy system model for Germany, PyPSA-DE, with high temporal resolution and myopic foresight in 5-year steps from 2020 until full decarbonisation in 2045. We find a clear transition from distinct price levels, corresponding to fossil fuels, to a smoother price curve set by variable renewable energy sources, batteries and electrolysis. Despite higher price volatility, the fully decarbonised system clears with non-zero prices in 75% of all hours. Our results suggest that flexibility and cross-sectoral demand bidding play a vital role in stabilising electricity prices in a climate-neutral future. These findings are highly relevant for guiding investment decisions and informing policy, particularly in support of dynamic pricing, the expansion of energy storage across multiple timescales, and the coordinated development of renewable and flexibility technologies.

Title:
The anatomy of Green AI technologies: structure, evolution, and impact
Lorenzo Emer, Andrea Mina, Andrea Vandin
Subjects:
General Economics (econ.GN)
Artificial intelligence (AI) is a key enabler of innovation against climate change. In this study, we investigate the intersection of AI and climate adaptation and mitigation technologies through patent analyses of a novel dataset of approximately 63 000 Green AI patents. We analyze patenting trends, corporate ownership of the technology, the geographical distributions of patents, their impact on follow-on inventions and their market value. We use topic modeling (BERTopic) to identify 16 major technological domains, track their evolution over time, and identify their relative impact. We uncover a clear shift from legacy domains such as combustion engines technology to emerging areas like data processing, microgrids, and agricultural water management. We find evidence of growing concentration in corporate patenting against a rapidly increasing number of patenting firms. Looking at the technological and economic impact of patents, while some Green AI domains combine technological impact and market value, others reflect weaker private incentives for innovation, despite their relevance for climate adaptation and mitigation strategies. This is where policy intervention might be required to foster the generation and use of new Green AI applications.

This paper investigates the economic feasibility of replacing human labor with robotics and automation in Qatar's manufacturing and service sectors. By analyzing labor costs, productivity gains, and implementation expenses, the study assesses the potential financial impact and return on investment of robotic integration. Results indicate the sectors where automation is economically viable and identify challenges related to workforce adaptation, policy, and infrastructure. These insights provide guidance for policymakers and industry stakeholders considering automation strategies in Qatar.

Title:
The temporary impact of permanent hiring incentives: Evidence from Italy
Michele Cantarella, Maria Cristina Maurizio, Francesco Serti
Comments:
44 pages, 11 figures
Subjects:
General Economics (econ.GN)
This paper evaluates the short and medium-term effectiveness of hiring incentives aimed at promoting the permanent conversion of temporary contracts through social contribution exemptions. Using rich administrative data from Tuscany, providing detailed employment histories, we use difference in differences and regression discontinuity designs to exploit a unique change in eligibility criteria in 2018. We find that the incentives immediately increased the probability of conversion, with no evidence of substitution against non-eligible cohorts. However, these positive effects were short-lived and appear to reflect anticipated conversions, as we find null longer-term effects on permanent hirings.

Title:
Targeted Advertising in Elections
Maria Titova
Subjects:
Theoretical Economics (econ.TH)
How does targeted advertising influence electoral outcomes? This paper presents a one-dimensional spatial model of voting in which a privately informed challenger persuades voters to support him over the status quo. I show that targeted advertising enables the challenger to persuade voters with opposing preferences and swing elections decided by such voters; under simple majority, the challenger can defeat the status quo even when it is located at the median voter's bliss point. Ex-ante commitment power is unnecessary -- the challenger succeeds by strategically revealing different pieces of verifiable information to different voters. Publicizing all political ads would mitigate the negative effects of targeted advertising and help voters collectively make the right choice.

Title:
Smooth Tests for Normality in ANOVA
Peiwen Jia, Xiaojun Song, Haoyu Wei
Subjects:
Econometrics (econ.EM)
The normality assumption for random errors is fundamental in the analysis of variance (ANOVA) models, yet it is rarely formally tested in practice. In this paper, we propose Neyman's smooth tests for assessing the normality assumption across various types of ANOVA models. The proposed test statistics are constructed based on the Gaussian probability integral transformation of ANOVA residuals. Under the null hypothesis of normality, the test statistics are asymptotically Chi-square distributed, with degrees of freedom determined by the dimension of the smooth model (the number of orthonormal functions). A data-driven selection of the model dimension using a modified Schwarz's criterion is also discussed. Simulation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Title:
Dealing with Logs and Zeros in Regression Models
Christophe Bellégo, David Benatia, Louis Pape
Subjects:
Econometrics (econ.EM); Methodology (stat.ME)
The log transformation is widely used in linear regression, mainly because coefficients are interpretable as proportional effects. Yet this practice has fundamental limitations, most notably that the log is undefined at zero, creating an identification problem. We propose a new estimator, iterated OLS (iOLS), which targets the normalized average treatment effect, preserving the percentage-change interpretation while addressing these limitations. Our procedure is the theoretically justified analogue of the ad-hoc log(1+Y) transformation and delivers a consistent and asymptotically normal estimator of the parameters of the exponential conditional mean model. iOLS is computationally efficient, globally convergent, and free of the incidental-parameter bias, while extending naturally to endogenous regressors through iterated 2SLS. We illustrate the methods with simulations and revisit three influential publications.

Title:
A shared-revenue Bertrand game
Raj Pabari, Udaya Ghai, Dominique Perrault-Joncas, Kari Torkkola, Orit Ronen, Dhruv Madeka, Aviad Rubinstein, Dean Foster, Omer Gottesman
Subjects:
Theoretical Economics (econ.TH)
We introduce and analyze a variation of the Bertrand game in which the revenue is shared between two players. This game models situations in which one economic agent can provide goods/services to consumers either directly or through an independent seller/contractor in return for a share of the revenue. We analyze the equilibria of this game, and show how they can predict different business outcomes as a function of the players' costs and the transferred revenue shares. Importantly, we identify game parameters for which independent sellers can simultaneously increase the original player's payoff while increasing consumer surplus. We then extend the shared-revenue Bertrand game by considering the shared revenue proportion as an action and giving the independent seller an outside option to sell elsewhere. This work constitutes a first step towards a general theory for how partnership and sharing of resources between economic agents can lead to more efficient markets and improve the outcomes of both agents as well as consumers.

Title:
Analysis of Multiple Long-Run Relations in Panel Data Models
Alexander Chudik, M. Hashem Pesaran, Ron P. Smith
Subjects:
Econometrics (econ.EM)
The literature on panel cointegration is extensive but does not cover data sets where the cross section dimension, $n$, is larger than the time series dimension $T$. This paper proposes a novel methodology that filters out the short run dynamics using sub-sample time averages as deviations from their full-sample counterpart, and estimates the number of long-run relations and their coefficients using eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the pooled covariance matrix of these sub-sample deviations. We refer to this procedure as pooled minimum eigenvalue (PME). We show that PME estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal as $n$ and $T \rightarrow \infty$ jointly, such that $T\approx n^{d}$, with $d>0$ for consistency and $d>1/2$ for asymptotic normality. Extensive Monte Carlo studies show that the number of long-run relations can be estimated with high precision, and the PME estimators have good size and power properties. The utility of our approach is illustrated by micro and macro applications using Compustat and Penn World Tables.

Title:
The Precautionary Principle and the Innovation Principle: Incompatible Guides for AI Innovation Governance?
Kim Kaivanto
Comments:
47 pages
Subjects:
Computers and Society (cs.CY); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); General Economics (econ.GN)
In policy debates concerning the governance and regulation of Artificial Intelligence (AI), both the Precautionary Principle (PP) and the Innovation Principle (IP) are advocated by their respective interest groups. Do these principles offer wholly incompatible and contradictory guidance? Does one necessarily negate the other? I argue here that provided attention is restricted to weak-form PP and IP, the answer to both of these questions is "No." The essence of these weak formulations is the requirement to fully account for type-I error costs arising from erroneously preventing the innovation's diffusion through society (i.e. mistaken regulatory red-lighting) as well as the type-II error costs arising from erroneously allowing the innovation to diffuse through society (i.e. mistaken regulatory green-lighting). Within the Signal Detection Theory (SDT) model developed here, weak-PP red-light (weak-IP green-light) determinations are optimal for sufficiently small (large) ratios of expected type-I to type-II error costs. For intermediate expected cost ratios, an amber-light 'wait-and-monitor' policy is optimal. Regulatory sandbox instruments allow AI testing and experimentation to take place within a structured environment of limited duration and societal scale, whereby the expected cost ratio falls within the 'wait-and-monitor' range. Through sandboxing regulators and innovating firms learn more about the expected cost ratio, and what respective adaptations -- of regulation, of technical solution, of business model, or combination thereof, if any -- are needed to keep the ratio out of the weak-PP red-light zone. Nevertheless AI foundation models are ill-suited for regulatory sandboxing as their general-purpose nature precludes credible identification of misclassification costs.

Title:
Web3 x AI Agents: Landscape, Integrations, and Foundational Challenges
Yiming Shen, Jiashuo Zhang, Zhenzhe Shao, Wenxuan Luo, Yanlin Wang, Ting Chen, Zibin Zheng, Jiachi Chen
Subjects:
Computers and Society (cs.CY); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); General Economics (econ.GN)
The convergence of Web3 technologies and AI agents represents a rapidly evolving frontier poised to reshape decentralized ecosystems. This paper presents the first and most comprehensive analysis of the intersection between Web3 and AI agents, examining five critical dimensions: landscape, economics, governance, security, and trust mechanisms. Through an analysis of 133 existing projects, we first develop a taxonomy and systematically map the current market landscape (RQ1), identifying distinct patterns in project distribution and capitalization. Building upon these findings, we further investigate four key integrations: (1) the role of AI agents in participating in and optimizing decentralized finance (RQ2); (2) their contribution to enhancing Web3 governance mechanisms (RQ3); (3) their capacity to strengthen Web3 security via intelligent vulnerability detection and automated smart contract auditing (RQ4); and (4) the establishment of robust reliability frameworks for AI agent operations leveraging Web3's inherent trust infrastructure (RQ5). By synthesizing these dimensions, we identify key integration patterns, highlight foundational challenges related to scalability, security, and ethics, and outline critical considerations for future research toward building robust, intelligent, and trustworthy decentralized systems with effective AI agent interactions.
