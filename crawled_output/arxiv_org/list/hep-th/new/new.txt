An effective density matrix for vacua in asymptotically flat gravity

We explicitly construct the density matrix associated to the vacuum state of a large spherically symmetric causal diamond of area $A$ in four-dimensional asymptotically flat gravity. We achieve this using the soft effective action, which characterizes the low-energy gravitational degrees of freedom that arise in the long-distance limit of the Einstein-Hilbert action and consists of both the soft graviton mode and the Goldstone mode arising from the spontaneous breaking of supertranslation symmetry. Integrating out the soft graviton mode, we obtain an effective action for purely the Goldstone mode, from which we extract the density matrix and therefore the modular Hamiltonian $K_{s}$ associated to the vacuum state. We explicitly compute the mean and variance of $K_{s}$, finding $\langle \Delta K_{s}^{2} \rangle = A/\epsilon_{\text{UV}}^{2}$, with $\epsilon_{\text{UV}}$ being a length-scale UV cutoff on the celestial sphere.

It has recently been shown that the Nambu-Goto equation for a string emerges from the junction conditions in three-dimensional gravity. Holographically, gravitational junctions are dual to interfaces in conformal field theory. We demonstrate that each stringy mode of the junction corresponds to a universal $\mathcal{H}_{in}\rightarrow \mathcal{H}_{out}$ quantum map between in and out Hilbert spaces of excitations scattered at the interface, and also a universal $\mathcal{H}_{L}\rightarrow \mathcal{H}_{R}$ quantum map relating the excitations on both sides. These quantum maps generalize those realized by defect operators and preserve the conformal boundary condition at the interface.

Hawking-Page transition in anti-de Sitter massive gravity with non-compact spatial boundary

High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
In gauge/gravity duality, the Hawking Page (HP) process plays the important role of representing a confined/deconfined phase transition. For spaces that are asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) with planar spatial boundary there is no HP transition, unless some infrared energy scale is introduced. Massive gravity theories have been applied in the context of holography in order to represent systems with momentum dissipation. In this work we study the HP transition for massive gravity in an asymptotically AdS space with $\mathbb{R}^n\times\, $S$^1 $ boundary. It is shown that the graviton mass term produces an HP transition at a finite critical temperature.

Conventional understandings of quantum theory hold that measurements change the state of an observed system following the Lüders update rule. Textbooks describe the application of this idea to non-relativistic systems, but extensions to relativistic and gravitating systems encounter subtleties. One consistent approach is via detector-based measurements. We study the effects of such measurements in a CFT with a holographic dual. We work out the boundary space-time regions associated to a Lüders update and how the outcome extends to modifications of the bulk gravity state. We explore information-theoretic consequences of this picture, and relate the information extracted by a measurement to updates of the semiclassical parameters of the bulk state.

Thermodynamic Split Conjecture and an Observational Test for Cosmological Entropy

We revisit string theoretic derivations of black hole entropy and argue that their enabling structures do not persist in realistic cosmologies. We formalize this as the Thermodynamic Split Conjecture (TSC) which is the statement that in any UV complete quantum gravity, black hole and cosmological horizon thermodynamics are generically inequivalent. The BKE criterion is then formulated to formalize this approach while we also discuss ways to falsify the conjecture. Finally, we propose an observational scaling test which is centered around comparisons of data native entropy proxies from tomographic maps to the Bekenstein Hawking prediction. The framework both sharpens when and why the area law holds and provides a roadmap towards a UV complete description of cosmological horizon entropy.

On the universal Casimir spectrum

Comments:
LaTeX, 15 pages
Subjects:

We conjecture the connection between $su$ and $so$ members of universal, in Vogel's sense, multiplets.
The key element is the notion of the {\it vertical componentwise sum} $\oplus_v$ of Young diagrams. Representations in the decomposition of the power of the adjoint representation of $su(N)$ algebra can be parameterized by a couple of $N$-independent Young diagrams $\lambda$ and $\tau$, with equal area. We assume that the $so(N)$ member of the universal (Casimir) multiplet of a given $su(N)$ representation is the $so$ representation with $\lambda \oplus_v \tau$ Young diagram. This allows one to obtain the universal form of the Casimir eigenvalue on that multiplet. Conjecture is checked for all known cases: universal decompositions of powers of adjoint up to fourth, and series of universal representations.
On this basis we suggest the set of universal Casimirs for fifth power of adjoint. We also conjecture that vertical sum operation is a kind of the (dual version of the) folding map of Dynkin diagrams. This will hopefully explain the intrinsic symmetry of universal formulae with respect to the automorphisms of Dynkin diagrams.

Dimensional reduction of the M-theory Chern-Simons term at order $\ell_p^6$

High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
The dimensional reduction of M-theory couplings at order $\ell_p^6$ is known to produce one-loop $\alpha'^3$ corrections in type IIA string theory. In this paper, we perform the Kaluza-Klein reduction of the M-theory Chern-Simons coupling $t_8\epsilon_{11} A R^4$ at this order. By meticulously accounting for non-gauge-invariant total derivative terms, we derive the complete set of corresponding one-loop, gauge-invariant couplings in the type IIA effective action. Our results not only reproduce the standard Chern-Simons term $t_8\epsilon_{10} B R^4$ which is gauge invariant up to total derivatives, but also unveil a new set of gauge-invariant couplings involving RR and NS-NS field strengths.
To validate our findings, we test their consistency under string dualities. We dimensionally reduce the derived type IIA couplings on a K3 manifold and show that the resulting one-loop $\alpha'$ corrections in six dimensions transform under S-duality into the dimensional reduction of the tree-level heterotic string Chern-Simons coupling $H_{\mu\nu\alpha} \Omega^{\mu\nu\alpha}$ on $T^4$. This non-trivial agreement provides strong evidence for the correctness of both the M-theory Chern-Simons term and its reduction to type IIA.

Chiral symmetry restoration for helical magnetic fields in holography
Nick Evans, Wanxiang Fan

Subjects:

We study the chiral symmetry breaking effects of helical magnetic fields in a simple bottom up AdS/CFT model. We explore the instability of the chirally symmetric solution in the presence of the B field and see how it switches off as the wave vector of the helix, k, rises, resulting in a first order transition. At low energies the model averages over the helix and the magnetic field is not seen. We show that other sources of chiral symmetry breaking are not directly effected by the helical B field. We provide examples of both magnetic catalysis and inverse magnetic catalysis which switch off at large k.

We argue that duality symmetries can be manifestly realised when theories with these symmetries are quantised using phase space quantum theory. In particular, using background fields and phase space quantum theory, we quantise the bosonic string and show that it has SO(26,26) symmetry, even when the string is not compactified on a torus.

Title:
Line defects and scattering amplitudes in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence
Martín Lagares
Comments:
PhD thesis, 254 pages, 16 figures
Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
Line defects and scattering amplitudes have proven to be fruitful objects of study in the context of holographic dualities. They serve as valuable theoretical laboratories for the development of non-perturbative methods and have provided fertile ground for unveiling remarkable structures that have deepened our understanding of quantum field theory, such as the positive geometry description of scattering amplitudes in theories like ${\cal N}=4$ super Yang-Mills and ABJM. This thesis focuses on two main goals. The first concerns the application of analytic conformal bootstrap and integrability methods to the study of superconformal line defects in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ and AdS$_4$/CFT$_3$ dualities. We present evidence for a vast family of BPS line defects in the context of AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ correspondences, providing an analytic bootstrap computation of four-point functions along 1/2 BPS defects at next-to-leading order in the strong-coupling regime. Moreover, we analyse the integrability properties of the 1/2 BPS Wilson line of the ABJM theory, whose spectral problem we show to be described by an integrable and open spin chain. We conjecture a Y-system of equations for the cusped Wilson line of the theory, which we test by reproducing the one-loop cusp anomalous dimension. The second goal of the thesis pertains to the analysis of infrared-finite functions, referred to as integrated negative geometries, that arise from the positive geometry description of scattering amplitudes in ABJM. We compute the four-point integrated negative geometries up to three loops and use this result to provide a direct four-loop computation of the light-like cusp anomalous dimension of the theory, in agreement with the integrability-based prediction present in the literature.

A Geometric View on Crossing-Symmetric Dispersion Relations

Subjects:

We introduce a general framework for constructing dispersion relations using crossing-symmetric variables, leading to infinitely many distinct representations of the 2-to-2 scattering amplitude of identical scalars. Classical formulations such as the Auberson-Khuri crossing-symmetric dispersion relations (CSDRs), the Mahoux-Roy-Wanders relations, and the local CSDR, as well as fixed-t dispersion relations emerge as special cases. Within this setting we re-derive the null constraints from a geometric perspective. Finally, we present, for the first time, an explicit extension of Roy-like equations that remain valid at arbitrarily high energies, relying only on the rigorously established analyticity domain of scattering amplitudes.

We consider a generalisation of vector fields on a vector space, where the vector space is generalised to a highest-weight module over a Kac-Moody algebra. The generalised vector field is an element in a non-associative superalgebra defined by the module and the Kac-Moody algebra. Also the Lie derivative of a vector field parameterised by another is generalised and expressed in a simple way in terms of this superalgebra. It reproduces the generalised Lie derivative in the general framework of extended geometry, which in special cases reduces to the one in exceptional field theory, unifying diffeomorphisms with gauge transformations in supergravity theories.

Entanglement Suppression in Quantum Field Theories: Holography, Chaos, and Mixed-State Dynamics

Recent work has revealed that entanglement entropy growth in conformal field theories (CFTs) can be suppressed when a local operator quench interacts with a mixed-state excitation, providing a dual interpretation in terms of black hole scattering in AdS. This phenomenon, termed \emph{entanglement suppression}, opens several promising directions for exploration. In this proposal, I outline five distinct yet interconnected research trajectories: generalization to higher dimensions, the role of quantum chaos via out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs), the absence of suppression in integrable models, the extension to entanglement negativity as a probe of mixedness, and a geometric interpretation based on scattering cross sections in AdS. Each direction offers new insights into the interplay between holography, non-equilibrium dynamics, and quantum information.

Regular black holes with gravitational self-energy as dark matter
Kimet Jusufi, Douglas Singleton
Comments:

Subjects:
General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
We incorporate the effect of non-local gravitational self-energy to obtain a neutral, non-singular spacetime geometry. This is achieved by using a non-local gravitational theory inspired by T-duality, where particle mass is not point-like but smeared over a region. This non-local gravitational self-interaction is derived from the Newtonian gravitational potential and energy density, allowing us to define a coordinate-independent quantity. Thus, we incorporate the non-local gravitational field into the spacetime metric. We demonstrate that the total ADM mass is modified by a finite, regularized gravitational mass term, leading to a regular solution of the Ayon-Beato-Garcia type metric but without electric charge. We show the existence of extremal configurations known as \emph{particle-black hole} objects of order of the Planck mass, which are thermodynamically stable, have a vanishing Hawking temperature and could be a viable dark matter candidate.

From Quantum Tsallis Entropy to Strange Metals

We develop a unified framework connecting quantum Tsallis statistics to electronic transport in strongly interacting systems. Starting from Rényi and Tsallis entropies, we construct a quantum Tsallis distribution that reduces to the conventional Fermi--Dirac distribution when $q=1$. For $q$ slightly deviating from unity, the correction term in the occupation function can be mapped to a $q$-deformed Schwarzian action, corresponding to soft reparametrization modes. Coupling these soft modes to electrons via the Fermi Golden Rule yields a modified scattering rate, which reproduces conventional Fermi-liquid behavior at low temperatures and linear-in-temperature resistivity at high temperatures. Using the memory matrix formalism, we analyze magnetotransport, finding a linear-in-field magnetoresistance and a Hall angle consistent with Anderson's two-lifetime scenario. At sufficiently low temperatures, both magnetoresistance and Hall response smoothly recover Fermi-liquid quadratic behaviors. This approach provides a controlled interpolation between Fermi-liquid and non-Fermi-liquid regimes, quantitatively linking $q$-deformation, soft-mode dynamics, and experimentally measurable transport coefficients in strange metals.

Free mutual information and higher-point OTOCs

We introduce a quantity called the free mutual information (FMI), adapted from concepts in free probability theory, as a new physical measure of quantum chaos. This quantity captures the spreading of a time-evolved operator in the space of all possible operators on the Hilbert space, which is doubly exponential in the number of degrees of freedom. It thus provides a finer notion of operator spreading than the well-understood phenomenon of operator growth in physical space. We derive two central results which apply in any physical system: first, an explicit ``Coulomb gas'' formula for the FMI of two observables $A(t)$ and $B$ in terms of the eigenvalues of the product operator $A(t)B$; and second, a general relation expressing the FMI as a weighted sum of all higher-point out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs). This second result provides a precise information-theoretic interpretation for the higher-point OTOCs as collectively quantifying operator ergodicity and the approach to freeness. This physical interpretation is particularly useful in light of recent progress in experimentally measuring higher-point OTOCs. We identify universal behaviours of the FMI and higher-point OTOCs across a variety of chaotic systems, including random unitary circuits and chaotic spin chains, which indicate that spreading in the doubly exponential operator space is a generic feature of quantum many-body chaos. At the same time, the non-generic behavior of the FMI in various non-chaotic systems, including certain unitary designs, shows that there are cases where an operator spreads in physical space but remains localized in operator space. The FMI is thus a sharper diagnostic of chaos than the standard 4-point OTOC.

The Local Unitarity formalism provides a constructive, integrand-level realisation of the Kinoshita-Lee-Nauenberg theorem, by combining loop and phase-space integrals appearing in scattering cross-sections in such a way that their final-state infrared singularities cancel before integration. Supplemented with localised ultraviolet renormalisation, it enables the direct Monte Carlo integration of (differential) cross sections at arbitrary perturbative order in four-dimensional spacetime. In this paper, we present its application to the Next-to-Next-to-Leading Order (NNLO) QCD cross sections for heavy-quark pair production in direct photon fusion, involving the contribution from 138 distinct forward-scattering diagrams where external photons couple only to heavy quarks. By combining NNLO QCD with Next-to-Leading Order (NLO) ElectroWeak (EW) corrections and Next-to-Leading Power (NLP) Coulomb resummation, we obtain state-of-the-art predictions for top-, bottom-, and charm-quark production in ultraperipheral hadron collisions and at $e^+ e^-$ colliders.

Quantum Resolution of Mass Inflation in Reissner-Nordström Interiors via Wheeler-DeWitt Equation

We construct a canonical quantization, the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, of the interior geometry of static and spherically symmetric black holes in Einstein-Maxwell-$\Lambda$ framework, focusing on Reissner-Nordström. The wave function of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation for the Reissner-Nordström black hole is set to be on-shell and exhibiting exponential damping away from the classical locus. Horizon boundary conditions for the wave function generate two regimes: a single inward mode from event horizon yields monotonic decay, while superpositions produce either a quantum bounce (single time arrow) or interference-driven annihilation-to-nothing (two time arrows). We show that these are generic features of static black hole interiors. Furthermore, the wave function of the Schwarzschild black hole, obtained as the charge-neutral limit of the Reissner-Nordström black hole, is monotonically decaying and no longer unbounded. Moreover, this framework unifies classical and quantum interiors, suggests a quantum gravitational resolution to the mass inflation, and motivates extensions to Kerr and regular black holes.

Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
The Riemann zeta function regularization is employed to extract finite temperature corrections to effective magnetic moment $S^*$ of one- and two-dimensional Heisenberg ferro- and antiferromagnets. Whereas for the one-dimensional ferromagnet we obtain the usual $T^{1/2}$ spin-wave dependence, for the antiferromagnetic chain the dependence is described by a generalized incomplete Riemann function. The quantity $S^*$ determines strong short-range magnetic order in the absence of long-range order, in particular the correlation length. For the one-dimensional ferromagnet, the results are confirmed by the self-consistent spin-wave theory and Monte Carlo simulations by Takahashi et al.

Generic scalar perturbations on a fixed slowly rotating Kerr-AdS black hole background exhibit stable trapping, that is, the scalar field remains in a region between the exterior of the black hole and the AdS boundary for a very long time, decaying only inverse logarithmically in time. We study this effect employing fully general simulations that take into account the non-linear backreaction of the scalar field on the geometry. We find that the stable trapping of generic perturbations of Kerr-AdS persists at the non-linear level. Furthermore, the spacetime settles into a time-dependant and non-axisymmetric black hole which differs from Kerr-AdS. Since our perturbations are generic, our results indicate that slowly rotating Kerr-AdS black holes are non-linearly unstable.

Recently, we have computed the short-distance asymptotics of the generating functional of Euclidean correlators of single-trace twist-$2$ operators in the large-$N$ expansion of SU($N$) Yang-Mills (YM) theory to the leading-nonplanar order. Remarkably, it has the structure of the logarithm of a functional determinant, but with the sign opposite to the one that would follow from the spin-statistics theorem for the glueballs. In order to solve this sign puzzle, we have reconsidered the proof in the literature that in the 't Hooft topological expansion of large-$N$ YM theory the leading-nonplanar contribution to the generating functional consists of the sum over punctures of $n$-punctured tori. We have discovered that for twist-$2$ operators it contains -- in addition to the $n$-punctured tori -- the normalization of tori with $1 \leq p \leq n$ pinches and $n-p$ punctures. Once the existence of the new sector is taken into account, the violation of the spin-statistics theorem disappears. Moreover, the new sector contributes trivially to the nonperturbative $S$ matrix because -- for example -- the $n$-pinched torus represents nonperturbatively a loop of $n$ glueball propagators with no external leg. This opens the way for an exact solution limited to the new sector that may be solvable thanks to the vanishing $S$ matrix.

The deformation approach of arXiv:2104.07816 for computing zeta functions of one-parameter Calabi-Yau threefolds is generalised to cover also multiparameter manifolds. Consideration of the multiparameter case requires the development of an improved formalism. This allows us, among other things, to make progress on some issues left open in previous work, such as the treatment of apparent and conifold singularities and changes of coordinates. We also discuss the efficient numerical computation of the zeta functions. As examples, we compute the zeta functions of the two-parameter mirror octic, a non-symmetric split of the quintic threefold also with two parameters, and the $S_5$ symmetric five-parameter Hulek-Verrill manifolds. These examples allow us to exhibit the several new types of geometries for which our methods make practical computations possible. They also act as consistency checks, as our results reproduce and extend those of arXiv:hep-th/0409202 and arXiv:math/0304169. To make the methods developed here more approachable, a Mathematica package "CY3Zeta" for computing the zeta functions of Calabi-Yau threefolds, which is attached to this paper, is presented.

Quasinormal modes for charged Lifshitz black holes with scalar hair

Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
In this paper, we investigate massive charged scalar perturbations in four-dimensional charged Lifshitz-AdS black holes with scalar hair, within the framework of Einstein--Maxwell--Dilaton (EMD) gravity. Using the improved asymptotic iteration method (AIM), we compute the quasinormal modes (QNMs) and explore their dependence on key parameters, including the Lifshitz dynamical exponent $z$, the scalar field mass and charge, and the black hole charge, under various spatial curvature settings ($k=0, \pm1$). Our results reveal rich and sensitive behavior in both the real and imaginary parts of QNMs. In particular, the decay rates can exhibit monotonic or non-monotonic dependence on the black hole charge, depending on the values of $z$, $m_s$, and $q_s$. These findings highlight the significant role of field and geometric parameters in governing the dynamical stability of Lifshitz black holes and offer insights into the perturbative properties of non-AdS holographic systems.

String field theories exhibit exponential suppression of interactions among the component fields at high energies due to infinite-derivative factors such as $e^{\ell^2 \Box / 2}$ in the vertices. This nonlocality has hindered the development of a consistent Hamiltonian formalism, leading some to question whether such a formalism is even viable. To address this challenge, we introduce a toy model inspired by string field theory and construct its Hamiltonian formalism by demanding that it reproduce all correlation functions derived from the path-integral formalism. Within this framework, we demonstrate for this toy model that physical-state constraints can be imposed to eliminate negative-norm states, while zero-norm states decouple from the physical state space. This approach provides a novel perspective on the nonlocality inherent in string field theories.

We investigate the validity of the thermal product formula proposed in [arXiv:2304.12339], for the shear channel fluctuations of R-charged black branes in five-dimensional AdS where the shear mode is coupled with charge diffusion mode at non-zero momentum. When these modes are suitably decoupled, we are able to obtain an exact formula for the two point functions of the boundary current and energy-momentum tensor in terms of the quasinormal modes of this channel. This exact formula is a simple modification of the previous version of the product formula. We also obtain a similar formula for the case involving a boundary global R-symmetry anomaly, when we have a bulk Chern-Simons term which introduces additional couplings in the shear channel. Also based on insights from the quasinormal mode spectrum, we report on an instability as well as the presence of high momentum long-lived modes associated with large values of the anomaly coefficient.

To effectively utilize the AdS/CFT correspondence, a precise set of rules must be established to guide the translation of computed quantities in the gravitational sector into their CFT counterparts, and vice versa. This framework is commonly referred to as the holographic dictionary. The formulation of such dictionaries opens a two-way gateway, allowing researchers to extend theoretical principles and findings from one domain into the other for further exploration and study. The development of a holographic dictionary for Lifshitz black holes and hyperscaling violation (HSV) models \cite{6} has provided an essential foundation for studying CFT thermodynamics and phase behavior of these black holes. Based on this framework, we will investigate their thermodynamic properties using two distinct approaches. In the first step, we adopt the classical and traditional method, identifying critical points to examine the behavior of the free energy function as a function of temperature near the critical boundary. By analyzing its behavior, we will study phase transitions and then proceed to evaluate the stability of the models. In the next step, to compare both methodologies and highlight their equivalence, particularly demonstrating the accessibility of the topological method compared to the classical approach, we will analyze phase behavior through the lens of topological charges.

Homogeneous isotropization dynamics and entropy production in a hot and dense strongly interacting fluid

We numerically investigate the time evolution of the non-equilibrium entropy during the homogeneous isotropization dynamics of the 2 R-Charge Black Hole (2RCBH) model, corresponding to a top-down holographic fluid defined at finite temperature and R-charge density. In addition to the entropy production, we also analyze the time evolution of the pressure anisotropy and the scalar condensate of the medium. When the system is far-from-equilibrium the dominant and weak energy conditions can be transiently violated. For all initial conditions considered, we observe the emergence of a periodic sequence of several close plateaus forming a stairway for the entropy as the system approaches thermodynamic equilibrium. The entropy stairway allows for the entropy to encode a periodic structure without violating the second law of thermodynamics. In fact, the complex frequency of the lowest quasinormal mode (QNM) of the system is directly tied to the periodic structure of the entropy stairway, which provides another explicit numerical confirmation of a quite general connection between entropy production and QNMs previously discovered in the literature. Furthermore, when the chemical potential of the 2RCBH fluid exceeds a certain threshold, the pressure anisotropy exhibits a late-time decay governed by a purely imaginary QNM, and as the system is doped with increasing values of R-charge chemical potential the late-time equilibration pattern of the pressure anisotropy gets increasingly deformed, eventually losing the oscillatory behavior observed at lower values of chemical potential.

It has recently been shown that there exists an $s$-channel sequence of classical corrections to the $H$ diagram computed long ago by Amati, Ciafaloni and Veneziano. At leading logarithmic accuracy, those corrections feature the gravity BFKL kernel as a crucial element, and may be computed through either rapidity renormalisation group equations or amplitudes built through $s$-channel unitarity cuts. In this paper, we evaluate six-graviton amplitudes in next-to-multi-Regge kinematics, and compute for the first time the Central Emission Vertex for the emission of two gravitons, which is relevant to evaluate the corrections to the gravity BFKL kernel, and thus to go beyond the leading logarithmic accuracy.

A primary goal of string phenomenology is to identify realistic four-dimensional physics within the landscape of string theory solutions. In F-theory, such solutions are encoded in the geometry of singular elliptic fibrations, whose study often requires particularly challenging and cumbersome computations. In this work, we introduce FTheoryTools, a novel software module integrated into the OSCAR computer algebra system, designed to automate the complex and tedious tasks involved in F-theory model building. Key features of FTheoryTools include the enumeration of G4-fluxes, the capability to perform blowups on arbitrary (including non-toric) loci, and a literature database of existing F-theory constructions employing a MaRDI-based data format for enhanced collaboration and reproducibility. As a demonstration of its power, we present a stress test by applying FTheoryTools to the challenging F-theory geometry with most flux vacua (arXiv:1511.03209). Our results illustrate the potential of FTheoryTools to streamline F-theory research and pave the way for future developments in the computational study of string phenomenology.

What if supersymmetry is not something to be hidden, but something to be reached?
We introduce the Supersymmetric Horizon Stabilization (SHS): a conceptually unified and analytically controlled framework for embedding metastable de Sitter vacua and trans-Planckian inflation within effective $\mathcal{N}=1$ supergravity. Built from a logarithmic Kähler potential modified by nilpotent constraints, SHS yields a framework that connects the early universe's inflationary phase, intermediate metastable acceleration, and a final supersymmetric fixed point.
We classify viable models by enforcing four essential criteria: absence of ghosts, de Sitter metastability, smooth Minkowski transitions, and asymptotic supersymmetry. The resulting scalar dynamics exhibit exponential field-space profiles, $\tau(\varphi) \sim e^{-\Delta\varphi}$, allowing trans-Planckian excursions with bounded moduli. This structure leads to finite geodesic distance and a stabilized gravitino mass, conditionally avoiding towers of light states and remaining consistent with the Gravitino and Swampland Distance Conjectures. At the same time, the divergent Euclidean cost of reaching the supersymmetric endpoint realizes the AdS and Generalized Swampland Distance Conjectures, situating the infrared boundary at infinite dynamical distance.
From this behavior emerges the Supersymmetric Horizon Conjecture: that consistent gravitational EFTs may begin and end with supersymmetry -- both at the origin and the asymptotic edge of cosmic evolution -- not as a fine-tuned remnant, but as a geometric boundary condition. SHS also supports localized features that transiently enhance scalar fluctuations, enabling efficient production of primordial black holes with masses far exceeding those in conventional inflationary scenarios.

This work addresses how the growth of invariant operators is influenced by their underlying symmetry structure. For this purpose, we introduce the symmetry-resolved Krylov complexity, which captures the time evolution of each block into which an operator, invariant under a given symmetry, can be decomposed. We find that, at early times, the complexity of the full operator is equal to the average of the symmetry-resolved contributions. At later times, however, the interplay among different charge sectors becomes more intricate. In general, the symmetry-resolved Krylov complexity depends on the charge sector, although in some cases this dependence disappears, leading to a form of Krylov complexity equipartition. Our analysis lays the groundwork for a broader application of symmetry structures in the study of Krylov space complexities with implications for thermalization and universality in many-body quantum systems.

Conformal 3-point correlators of conserved currents play important roles in numerous directions. These correlators are fixed by conformal symmetry up to few parameters, which are known only at the leading order in the perturbative expansions. The major challenges are from the multi-loop Feynman integrals with three external momenta. In this work, we employ the method of subgraphs to compute the subleading order corrections to the conformal current 3-point correlators in the large $N$ expansion. We show that the method of subgraphs generates diagrammatic expansions for the conformal 3-point correlators, and it closely relates to the operator product expansions in momentum space. We verify the subgraph expansions of the conserved current 3-point correlators using the exact results in 3D. We demonstrate that the multi-loop 3-point Feynman integrals can be significantly simplified by taking the subgraph expansions. Due to the constraints from conformal symmetry, it suffices to keep the first few terms of the subgraphs to completely fix the subleading order corrections. We apply this method to compute the $1/N$ corrections to the current correlators $\langle JJJ\rangle$ in the critical $O(N)$ vector model and the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model. We also compute the $1/N$ corrections to the coefficients in the current-current-scalar correlators $\langle JJ\sigma_{T}\rangle$ and $\langle JJ\sigma\rangle$ in the critical $O(N)$ vector model. We compare the perturbative result with the bootstrap data and discuss its application for the conductivity near the quantum critical point.

QCD Effective Lagrangian and Condensation of Chromomagnetic Flux Tubes

Subjects:

Vacuum polarisation effects induced by the sourceless solutions of the Yang-Mills equation are investigated. These solutions represent oppositely oriented chromomagnetic flux tubes permeating the space in all directions. We review and prove the gauge invariance of the effective Lagrangian on sourceless gauge fields and present a number of alternative methods allowing to compute the effective Lagrangian. We compute the effective Lagrangian on chromomagnetic flux tube solutions and demonstrate that the effective Lagrangian has a universal form that supports the stability of the chromomagnetic flux tubes condensation and indicates that the Yang-Mills vacuum state is highly degenerate. The stability is a result of the quartic nonlinear self-interaction of the negative mode completely eliminating the instability and the imaginary term from the effective Lagrangian in chromomagnetic field. It is suggested that the condensate of chromomagnetic flux tubes represents a dual analog of the Cooper pairs condensate in a superconductor.

Canonical Gravity in Degenerate Limit

We construct a limit of Hamiltonian gravity as the determinant of the spatial triad (and hence of the four-metric) goes to zero. Within the Barbero-Immirzi SU (2) formulation, we present two possible realizations of this limit, with the consequence that the Hamiltonian constraint becomes simpler and spatial diffeomorphisms become trivial. In the first case, the Hamiltonian constraint exhibits a polynomial structure, being formally similar to the Euclidean Hamitonian constraint of Sen-Ashtekar self-dual formulation. In the latter, the constraints become free from ordering ambiguity. Further, we show that the Carrollian gravity emerges as a special case of this degenerate limit, thus providing it a new geometric interpretation independent of the speed of light or any dimensionful coupling constant (G).

Non-Clifford and parallelizable fault-tolerant logical gates on constant and almost-constant rate homological quantum LDPC codes via higher symmetries

We study parallel fault-tolerant quantum computing for families of homological quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes defined on 3-manifolds with constant or almost-constant encoding rate. We derive generic formula for a transversal $T$ gate of color codes on general 3-manifolds, which acts as collective non-Clifford logical CCZ gates on any triplet of logical qubits with their logical-$X$ membranes having a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ triple intersection at a single point. The triple intersection number is a topological invariant, which also arises in the path integral of the emergent higher symmetry operator in a topological quantum field theory: the $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$ gauge theory. Moreover, the transversal $S$ gate of the color code corresponds to a higher-form symmetry supported on a codimension-1 submanifold, giving rise to exponentially many addressable and parallelizable logical CZ gates. A construction of constant-depth circuits of the above logical gates via cup product cohomology operation is also presented for three copies of identical toric codes on arbitrary 3-manifolds. We have developed a generic formalism to compute the triple intersection invariants for 3-manifolds. We further develop three types of LDPC codes supporting such logical gates: (1) A quasi-hyperbolic code from the product of 2D hyperbolic surface and a circle, with almost-constant rate $k/n=O(1/\log(n))$ and $O(\log(n))$ distance; (2) A homological fibre bundle code with $O(1/\log^{\frac{1}{2}}(n))$ rate and $O(\log^{\frac{1}{2}}(n))$ distance; (3) A specific family of 3D hyperbolic codes: the Torelli mapping torus code, constructed from mapping tori of a pseudo-Anosov element in the Torelli subgroup, which has constant rate while the distance scaling is currently unknown. We then show a generic constant-overhead scheme for applying a parallelizable universal gate set with the aid of logical-$X$ measurements.

We consider chiral, generally nonlinear density waves in one dimension, modelling the bosonized edge modes of a two-dimensional fermionic topological insulator. Using the coincidence between bosonization and Lie-Poisson dynamics on an affine U(1) group, we show that wave profiles which are periodic in time produce Berry phases accumulated by the underlying fermionic field. These phases can be evaluated in closed form for any Hamiltonian, and they serve as a diagnostic of nonlinearity. As an explicit example, we discuss the Korteweg-de Vries equation, viewed as a model of nonlinear quantum Hall edge modes.

We study how a machine based on deep learning algorithms learns Krylov spread complexity in quantum systems with N x N random Hamiltonians drawn from the Gaussian unitary ensemble. Using thermofield double states as initial conditions, we demonstrate that a convolutional neural network-based algorithm successfully learns the Krylov spread complexity across all timescales, including the late-time plateaus where states appear nearly featureless and random. Performance strongly depends on the basis choice, performing well with the energy eigenbasis or the Krylov basis but failing in the original basis of the random Hamiltonian. The algorithm also effectively distinguishes temperature-dependent features of thermofield double states. Furthermore, we show that the system time variable of state predicted by deep learning is an irrelevant quantity, reinforcing that the Krylov spread complexity well captures the essential features of the quantum state, even at late times.

Primordial black holes (PBHs) offer a compelling candidate for dark matter. The production of PBHs through well-tested and accepted physical processes is highly worthy of investigation. This work highlights the role of turbulences in the very early universe in sustaining intense and persistent fluctuations in energy or mass density, which could provide a natural mechanism for PBH formation in the primordial universe. We analyze the mass range and abundance of PBHs produced in the magnetohydrodynamic turbulence induced by the electroweak phase transition. Remarkably, we find that the mass range of the produced PBHs falls within the most viable ``asteroid mass'' window from the present-day observations, and within natural parameter regions their abundance can be sufficiently large. These findings suggest that PBHs produced during magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in the very early universe may comprise a dominant part of dark matter.

We extend the projected sensitivity of LDMX for sub-GeV dark matter (DM) to the case of dark photons produced through higher order electromagnetic moments. These moments arise from loop diagrams involving portal matter fields, along with the gauge fields of new symmetry groups. Due to the Lorentz structures, in particular the momentum dependence, of these additional interactions, the kinematic distributions expected at missing momentum/energy experiments vary with model in addition to dark photon mass. By considering four additional types of interactions -- magnetic and electric dipole, charge radius, and anapole moment -- we show that LDMX Phase-II is expected to probe the relic target of these additional dark photon models. We compare the analytic with the numerical methods for calculating the dark bremsstrahlung cross section, and compute the kinematic distributions for each model. The potential for model discrimination in the scenario of non-zero signal events at LDMX is discussed. We find that there is a degeneracy between the dark photon mass and model, which can be partially broken by considering both the energy and the transverse momentum of the recoil electron.

We develop a Lagrangian formulation for gravity with matter where the gravitational couplings are universally treated as being field-dependent. The solutions for FLRW geometries and the associated time evolution of the Newton and cosmological couplings are found. The distance-redshift relations are shown to prefer a slowly growing Newton's coupling along with a negative equation of state ($w\geq -\frac{1}{3}$) for the matter fluid at the present epoch of accelerated expansion, while ruling out Dirac's large number hypothesis. We obtain an improved bound on $\dot{G}(t)$ as: $1.67\times 10^{-11} yr^{-1}<\frac{\dot{G}}{G}<3.34\times 10^{-11} yr^{-1}$ in the context of supernova cosmology, as well as a new constraint on $\dot{\Lambda}(t)$ as: $-0.67\times 10^{-11} yr^{-1}<\frac{\dot{\Lambda}}{\Lambda}<-1.34\times 10^{-11} yr^{-1}$. Based on this formulation, we also present a dynamical solution to the `cosmic coincidence' problem.

In addition to clarifying the roles of the contorsion and symplectic terms, we introduce the three-state quantum geometric tensor as a necessary element in the geometric classification of nonlinear responses and discuss the significance of the emergent terms from a gravitational point of view. We also identify a dual quantum geometric drag force in momentum space that provides an entropic source term for the multiband matrix of Einstein field equations.

The closed-form expressions of electric potentials and field lines for a uniformly-charged tube and cylinder are presented using elliptic integrals and Appell's hypergeometric functions, where field lines are depicted by introducing the concept of the field line potential in axisymmetric systems, whose contour lines represent electric field lines outside the charged region, thought of as an analog of the conjugate harmonic function in the presence of non-uniform metric. The field line potential for the tube shows a multi-valued behavior and enables us to define a topological charge. The integral of $Z(u|m)\operatorname{sc}(u|m)$, where $ Z $ and $ \operatorname{sc} $ are the Jacobi zeta and elliptic functions, is also expressed by Appell's hypergeometric function as a by-product, which was missing in classical tables of formulas. In the Addendum appended after the main article, several relevant references are provided and the decomposition of the solution by ``degrees of transcendence'' is proposed.

The character of every irreducible finite-dimensional representation of a simple Lie algebra has the highest weight property. The invariance of the character under the action of the Weyl group W implies that there is a similar "extremal weight property" for every weight obtained by applying an element of W to the highest weight. In this paper we conjecture an analogous "extremal monomial property" of the q-characters of simple finite-dimensional modules over the quantum affine algebras, using the braid group action on q-characters defined by Chari. In the case of the identity element of W, this is the highest monomial property of q-characters proved in arXiv:math/9911112. Here we prove it for simple reflections. Somewhat surprisingly, the extremal monomial property for each w in W turns out to be equivalent to polynomiality of the "X-series" corresponding to w, which we introduce in this paper. We show that these X-series are equal to certain limits of the generalized Baxter operators for all w in W. Thus, we find a new bridge between q-characters and the spectra of XXZ-type quantum integrable models associated to quantum affine algebras. This leads us to conjecture polynomiality of all generalized Baxter operators, extending the results of arXiv:1308.3444.

Quantum simulation offers a powerful approach to studying quantum field theories, particularly (2+1)D quantum electrodynamics (QED$_3$), which hosts a rich landscape of physical phenomena. A key challenge in lattice formulations is the proper realization of topological phases and the Chern-Simons terms, where fermion discretization plays a crucial role. In this work, we analyze staggered and Wilson fermions coupled to $\text{U}(1)$ background gauge fields in the Hamiltonian formulation and demonstrate that staggered fermions fail to induce (2+1)D topological phases, while Wilson fermions admit a variety of topological phases including Chern insulator and quantum spin Hall phases. We additionally uncover a rich phase diagram for the two-flavor Wilson fermion model in the presence of a chemical potential. Our findings resolve existing ambiguities in Hamiltonian formulations and provide a theoretical foundation for future quantum simulations of gauge theories with topological phases. We further outline connections to experimental platforms, offering guidance for implementations on near-term quantum computing architectures.

We investigate the impact of curvature corrections to Starobinsky inflation in light of the latest observational results from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). While the pure Starobinsky model remains a compelling candidate for cosmic inflation, we explore how the higher-order curvature terms $R^3$, $R^{4}$ and $R^{3/2}$ modify the inflationary predictions. Using the scalar-tensor formulation of $f(R)$ gravity, we derive the effective scalar potentials and compute the resulting scalar tilt $n_s$, its running index $\alpha_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. We show that those curvature corrections can shift the predictions to align better with the ACT data, thus providing a possible resolution to a minor discrepancy between the standard Starobinsky model and ACT observations. Our findings suggest that the modified Starobinsky models with the higher-order curvature terms offer a viable pathway to reconciling inflationary predictions with precision cosmological measurements. At the same time, measuring or constraining primordial tensor modes can help to discriminate between these corrections.

Recently, a connection has been shown between certain geometric quantities and quantum information theory. In this paper, we demonstrate that geometric quantities such as area and volume can emerge directly from entangled multi-qubit states. In particular, the area of a two-dimensional parallelogram is derived from a 4-qubit entangled state, the vector area of a three-dimensional parallelogram from three 6-qubit entangled states, and the volume of a three-dimensional parallelepiped from a 9-qubit entangled state. Corresponding quantum circuits are constructed and implemented using Qiskit to generate the required entangled states. Given that parallelograms and parallelepipeds serve as elementary building blocks for more complex geometric structures, these results may offer a pathway toward exploring emergent geometry in quantum information frameworks

We continue scientific scrutiny of the DESI dynamical dark energy (DE) claim by explicitly demonstrating that the result depends on the analysis pipeline. Concretely, we define a likelihood that converts the $w_0 w_a$CDM model back into the (flat) $\Lambda$CDM model, which we fit to DESI constraints on the $\Lambda$CDM model from DR1 Full-Shape (FS) modelling and BAO. We further incorporate CMB constraints. Throughout, we find that $w_0$ and $w_a$ are within $1 \sigma$ of the $\Lambda$CDM model. Our work makes it explicit that, in contrast to DR1 and DR2 BAO, there is no dynamical DE signal in FS modelling, even when combined with BAO and CMB. Moreover, one confirms late-time accelerated expansion today $(q_0 < 0)$ at $ \gtrsim 3.4 \sigma$ in FS modelling + BAO. On the contrary, DR1 and DR2 BAO fail to confirm $q_0 < 0$ under similar assumptions. Our analysis highlights the fact that trustable scientific results should be independent of the analysis pipeline.

Superradiant Axionic Black-Hole Clouds as Seeds for Graviton Squeezing

It is shown that both, standard general relativity (GR) and Chern-Simons (CS) gravity, the latter containing chiral gravitational anomaly terms, seed the production of pairs of entangled gravitons in a multi-mode squeezed state. This involves the interaction of gravitons with the axionic cloud surrounding a superradiant Kerr (rotating) black hole background. The order of magnitude of the squeezing effect, specifically the number of graviton excitations in the squeezed vacuum, is estimated in the non-relativistic limit, relevant for the superradiance process. It is found analytically that the squeezing from the GR process of annihilation of two axions into two gravitons, dominates, by many orders of magnitude, that coming from the axion decay into two gravitons, induced by the higher-derivative CS term. It is also shown that significant squeezing effects are produced in the case of long-lived axionic clouds, whose lifetimes are much longer than the timescale for which superradiance is effective.

Disentangling the Origins of the NANOGrav Signal: Early Universe Models and $ΔN_{eff}$ Bounds

We investigate whether an Early-Universe stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) can account for the common spectrum process reported by NANOGrav, while also being consistent with current and projected CMB measurements of extra radiation. We compute the contribution of effective number of relativistic species, $\Delta N_{eff}$, for a number of Early-Universe models proposed to explain the pulsar timing array (PTA) spectrum. We demonstrate that models predicting $\Delta N_{eff}$ above the CMB limit would be firmly excluded, implying that the NANOGrav signal in tension with these bounds must instead arise from astrophysical sources. We find that current NANOGrav 15-year dataset, sensitive up to 60 nHz, gives a negligible contribution to $\Delta N_{eff}$ and remains well below the present and future CMB detection threshold. However, when we project future PTA capabilities reaching upto 1 $\mu$Hz, even with our conservative estimate we find that Inflation, Scalar Induced Gravitational Waves (SIGW), and metastable cosmic strings can induce a $\Delta N_{eff}$ large enough for $>3.5\sigma$ detection by the Simons Observatory.

Title:
Scalable hybrid quantum Monte Carlo simulation of U(1) gauge field coupled to fermions on GPU

14+4 pages, 6+6 figures

We develop a GPU-accelerated hybrid quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithm to solve the fundamental yet difficult problem of $U(1)$ gauge field coupled to fermions, which gives rise to a $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state under the description of (2+1)d quantum electrodynamics QED$_3$. The algorithm renders a good acceptance rate and, more importantly, nearly linear space-time volume scaling in computational complexity $O(N_{\tau} V_s)$, where $N_\tau$ is the imaginary time dimension and $V_s$ is spatial volume, which is much more efficient than determinant QMC with scaling behavior of $O(N_\tau V_s^3)$. Such acceleration is achieved via a collection of technical improvements, including (i) the design of the efficient problem-specific preconditioner, (ii) customized CUDA kernel for matrix-vector multiplication, and (iii) CUDA Graph implementation on the GPU. These advances allow us to simulate the $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state with unprecedentedly large system sizes, which is up to $N_\tau\times L\times L = 660\times66\times66$, and reveal its novel properties. With these technical improvements, we see the asymptotic convergence in the scaling dimensions of various fermion bilinear operators and the conserved current operator when approaching the thermodynamic limit. The scaling dimensions find good agreement with field-theoretical expectation, which provides supporting evidence for the conformal nature of the $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state in the \qed. Our technical advancements open an avenue to study the Dirac spin liquid state and its transition towards symmetry-breaking phases at larger system sizes and with less computational burden.

Title:
Critical quantum liquids and the cuprate high temperature superconductors

Comments:
92 pages, 43 figures. Review article based on lectures by SS at Boulder, Trieste, Hong Kong, with links to lecture videos. Comments welcome. v3. Introduced terminology of Ancilla Layer Model (ALM). v4. Added additional QMC results on variable exponents in Griffiths phase

We present a theoretical framework for the cuprate superconductors, rooted in a fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*) description of the intermediate-temperature pseudogap phase at low doping. The FL* theory predicted hole pockets each of fractional area $p/8$ at hole doping $p$, in contrast to the area $p/4$ in a spin density wave state or its thermal fluctuation. A recent magnetotransport observation of the Yamaji angle is in good agreement with area $p/8$.
We review a theory for the FL* phase of a single-band model using a layer construction with a pair of ancilla qubits on each site: the Ancilla Layer Model (ALM). Its mean field yields hole pockets of area $p/8$, and matches the gapped photoemission spectrum in the anti-nodal region of the Brillouin zone. Fluctuations are described by the SU(2) gauge theory of a background spin liquid with critical Dirac spinons. A Monte Carlo study of the thermal SU(2) gauge theory transforms the hole pockets into Fermi arcs in photoemission. One route to confinement of FL* upon lowering temperature yields a $d$-wave superconductor via a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition of $h/(2e)$ vortices, with nodal Bogoliubov quasiparticles featuring anisotropic velocities and vortices surrounded by charge order halos. An alternative route produces a charge-ordered metallic state that exhibits quantum oscillations in agreement with experiments.
Increasing doping from the FL* phase in the ALM drives a transition to a Fermi liquid at large doping, passing through an intermediate strange metal regime. We formulate a theory of this metal using a critical quantum `charge' liquid of mobile electrons in the presence of disorder, via an extension of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model.
At low temperatures, and across optimal and over doping, we address the regimes of extended non-Fermi liquid behavior by Griffiths effects near quantum phase transitions in disordered metals.

Title:
The Classification of 3+1d Symmetry Enriched Topological Order

Comments:
31 pages
Subjects:
Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Category Theory (math.CT); Quantum Algebra (math.QA)
We use a 2-categorical version of (de-)equivariantization to classify (3+1)d topological orders with a finite $G$-symmetry. In particular, we argue that (3+1)d fermionic topological order with $G$-symmetry correspond to $\mathbf{2SVect}$-enriched $G$-crossed braided fusion 2-categories. We then show that the categorical data necessary to define these theories agrees with that arising from a fermionic generalization of the Wang-Wen-Witten construction of bosonic topological theories with $G$-symmetry saturating an anomaly. More generally, we also explain how 2-categorical (de-) equivariantization yields a classification of all braided fusion 2-categories.

Symmetric tensor portals to dark matter I: Creation of dark scalars

We examine the creation of scalar dark matter through a symmetric tensor portal. We find that both freeze-in and thermal freeze-out through a symmetric tensor mediator can create scalar dark matter. The required tensor masses for freeze-in are much larger than for freeze-out for the same dark-matter mass, in agreement with the nonthermalization assumption in freeze-in scenarios.

Title:
Black Hole Gravitational Phenomena in Higher-Order Curvature-Scalar Gravity

79 pages, 25 figures and 17 tables -- Revised version incorporating corrections to the references

This work aims to explore the gravitational consequences of a recently proposed black hole solution presented in the literature [Phys. Dark Univ. 50 (2025) 102061]. We initiate our analyzes by taking into account the horizon structure, focusing on both the event and Cauchy horizons. Subsequently, we examine the quasinormal modes by considering all types of perturbations -- scalar, vector, tensor, and spinorial. To strengthen these results, we also compute the time-domain for each perturbation. Next, we turn to the study of optical properties of the black hole. In particular, we investigate null geodesics, the photon sphere and its stability, as well as the corresponding black hole shadows. Following this, we analyze gravitational lensing phenomena in two regimes: the weak-field limit, utilizing the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, and the strong deflection limit, employing Tsukamoto's approach. In addition, we confront the lensing observables with Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) data for $Sgr A^{*}$ and $M87^{*}$. Finally, constraints on the parameter $\xi$ -- which is introduced by higher-order curvature-scalar gravity, thereby differing from the Schwarzschild solution -- are estimated using Solar System measurements such as the precession of Mercury's orbit, gravitational light bending, and time delay (or Shapiro effect).
