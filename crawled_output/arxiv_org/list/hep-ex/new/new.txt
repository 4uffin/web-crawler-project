Measurement of the branching fraction of the $Λ_b^0\to JψΛ$ decay and isospin asymmetry of $B\to JψK$ decays

This paper describes a measurement of the \LbJpsiLambda branching fraction using data collected with the LHCb experiment in proton-proton collisions from 2016 to 2018. The dataset corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 5.4\invfb. The branching fraction is determined relative to that of $B^0\to J\psi K^0_\text{S}$ decays, $\frac{\mathcal{B}(\Lambda_b^0\to J\psi\Lambda)}{\mathcal{B}(B^0\to J\psi K^0_\text{S}} = 0.750 \pm 0.005 \pm 0.022 \pm 0.005 \pm 0.062\,,$ yielding $\mathcal{B}(\Lambda_b^0\to J\psi\Lambda) = (3.34 \pm 0.02 \pm 0.10 \pm 0.08 \pm 0.28)\times 10^{-4}$, where the first uncertainty is statistical, the second systematic, the third due to external inputs on branching fractions and the fourth due to the ratio of $\Lambda_b^0$ baryon and $B^0$ meson hadronisation fractions. In addition, the isospin asymmetry between the rates of $B^0\to J\psi K^0_\text{S}$ and $B^0\to J\psi K^+$ decays is measured to be $A_{\rm I} = -0.0135 \pm 0.0004 \pm 0.0133$, where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second systematic.

Physics potential of the IceCube Upgrade for atmospheric neutrino oscillations
IceCube Collaboration

High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)
The IceCube Upgrade is an extension of the existing IceCube Neutrino Observatory and will be deployed in the 2025-2026 austral summer. It will significantly improve the sensitivity of the detector to atmospheric neutrino oscillations. The existing 86-string IceCube array contains a dense in-fill known as DeepCore which is optimized to measure neutrinos with energies down to a few GeV. The IceCube Upgrade will consist of seven new densely-instrumented strings placed within the DeepCore volume to further enhance the performance in the GeV energy range. The additional strings will feature new optical modules, each containing multiple PMTs, in contrast to the existing modules that each contain a single PMT. This will more than triple the number of PMT channels with respect to the current IceCube configuration, allowing for improved detection efficiency and reconstruction performance at GeV energies. We describe necessary updates to simulation, event selection, and reconstruction to accommodate the higher data rates observed by the upgraded detector and the addition of multi-PMT modules. We determine the expected sensitivity of the IceCube Upgrade to the atmospheric neutrino oscillation parameters sin$^2\theta_{23}$ and $\Delta m^2_{32}$, the appearance of tau neutrinos and the neutrino mass ordering. The IceCube Upgrade will provide neutrino oscillation measurements that are of similar precision to those from accelerator experiments, while providing complementarity by probing higher energies and longer baselines, and with different sources of systematic uncertainties.

A search for resonant structures in the $J/\psi +\psi$(2S) mass spectrum is performed using proton--proton collision data at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 140 fb$^{-1}$, recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC. The decay channels of $J/\psi +\psi\text{(2S)} \rightarrow 4\mu$ and $J/\psi +\psi\text{(2S)} \rightarrow 4\mu+2\pi$ are analyzed. An excess near 6.9 GeV is observed in both channels with a combined significance of 8.9$\sigma$. No significant signal is observed near 7.2 GeV, and an upper limit on its yield relative to $X$(6900) is provided. A simultaneous fit with the di-$J/\psi$ channel is carried out under assumptions regarding the resonance interferences, yielding a ratio of the partial decay widths between the $J/\psi +\psi\text{(2S)}$ and di-$J/\psi$ channels of $1.08\pm 0.20_{-0.17}^{+0.40}$ for the resonance near 6.9 GeV.

We detail experimental results inferring ionization and temperature for warm dense copper plasmas at several times solid density (15 to 25 g/cm$^3$) and temperatures of 10 to 21 eV. Experiments performed at the OMEGA Laser Facility generate uniform warm dense matter conditions via symmetric shock compression of a buried copper layer. The plasma is probed with a laser-generated x-ray source to collect the K-shell x-ray absorption spectrum. Fitting bound-bound absorption contributions from constituent charge states of copper provides an estimated $\overline{Z}$ of approximately 4 to 7 for these warm dense copper plasmas. We find that these partially ionized plasmas have K-edge shifts of 12 to 30 eV and bound-bound resonance 1s$\rightarrow$3p absorption shifts of 4 to 26 eV with respect to the cold K-edge. This study provides necessary experimental data to improve ionization and opacity models in the warm dense matter regime.

Quantum spread complexity as a probe of NSI, $CP$ Violation, and mass ordering in neutrino oscillations in matter

Quantum spread complexity characterizes how a quantum state evolves and becomes distributed over the Hilbert space under unitary dynamics. In this work, we employ a cost function as a quantitative measure of spread complexity. We investigate this cost function within the framework of three-flavor neutrino oscillations in vacuum and matter, incorporating the $CP$-violation phase and Non-Standard Interaction (NSI) effects, under both normal and inverted mass ordering scenarios. The cost function is evaluated for each scenario and analyzed with the corresponding neutrino transition probabilities for both initial muon neutrino and muon antineutrino flavor states. The results are presented using the energy where the first oscillation is maximum and baseline lengths of ongoing long-baseline accelerator neutrino experiments, including T2K and NOvA, as well as upcoming experiments such as DUNE and P2O. Our findings indicate that the difference in the cost function between normal and inverted mass orderings during neutrino propagation in matter is sensitive to these experiments, with the appropriate choice of NSI parameters and the best-fit $CP$-violation phase values.

The anisotropic flow coefficients $v_n$ quantify the collective medium response to the initial spatial anisotropy of the overlapping region in ion collisions and serve as sensitive probes of both the medium properties and shape of nuclear initial states. In this analysis, the $v_2$ and $v_3$ parameters of prompt charged particles are measured using the multiparticle cumulant method in fixed-target PbNe and PbAr collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 70.9$ GeV, collected by LHCb using the SMOG2 gas-target system during the 2024 LHC lead-beam run. The cumulant method is first validated using 2018 PbPb collision data, successfully reproducing previous measurements obtained via the two-particle correlation method. Results for the fixed-target collisions are then presented, showing a significantly larger value of the elliptic flow coefficient $v_2$ in central PbNe with respect to PbAr collisions. This is qualitatively consistent with 3+1D hydrodynamic predictions including ab-initio descriptions of the nuclear structure. The results provide the first experimental confirmation of the distinctive bowling-pin shape of the ground-state $^{20}$Ne nucleus, validating at the same time the hydrodynamic description of the hot medium formed in high-energy collisions involving light ions.

Observing Double Higgs Production at the LHC via Neutrino Feature Engineering in $hh\to b\bar{b}\ell\ellνν$

Double Higgs production is challenging even at the High Luminosity LHC. The Standard Model (SM) $hh\to b\bar{b}WW(ZZ)\to b\bar{b}\ell\ell\nu\nu$ has a moderate cross section compared to other decay modes, but its backgrounds, mainly top quark pairs and Drell-Yan production, are overwhelming. In this work, we propose new kinematic features designed to improve the discrimination of double Higgs pairs, in the $b\bar{b}\ell\ell\nu\nu$ channel, with cut-based and multivariate analyses. The new features are built with the neutrinos' momenta solutions obtained from imposing mass constraints when calculating Higgsness and Topness variables. For the SM $hh$ production, we estimate a $3.7\sigma$ statistical significance from an optimized cut-based strategy, improving about 20% over the best estimates of the literature, and $5\sigma$ from a multivariate analysis if systematic uncertainties on the backgrounds are small. The new variables are constructed as ratios of kinematic functions of the particles' momenta, being less prone to systematic errors. We also demonstrate the usefulness of the solutions in reconstructing heavy scalar resonances and other variables of phenomenological importance.

Searching for leptophilic composite asymmetric dark sector at $e^+e^-$ colliders

High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)
Composite asymmetric dark matter (ADM) models provide a well-motivated paradigm that simultaneously explains dark matter (DM) relic density and matter-antimatter asymmetry. In these models, the mass of the DM candidate (the lightest dark baryon) is generated through the dark confinement scale dynamics. Although the leptophilic composite ADM model offers a viable framework, comprehensive studies of its collider phenomenology are absent. This work systematically explores novel signatures from leptophilic composite asymmetric dark sector at both low-energy and high-energy $e^+e^-$ colliders as well as other existing collider constraints. We demonstrate detectability of TeV-scale mediators along with sub-GeV to GeV-scale lightest dark mesons at Belle II and its proposed far detector, GAZELLE, as well as CEPC experiments. Moreover, these experiments exhibit complementary coverage of the model parameter space.

We review the state of the art in the detection of extreme high-energy neutrinos, focusing on the IceCube and KM3NeT neutrino telescopes. IceCube, operating deep in Antarctic ice, and KM3NeT, a new array in the Mediterranean Sea, employ distinct designs to capture Cherenkov light from neutrino interactions. We examine their detector architectures, readout and reconstruction performance for PeV-scale and higher-energy neutrinos. Recent candidate events above 5 PeV are highlighted. These include a ~120 PeV muon track observed by KM3NeT in 2023, and IceCube's highest-energy detections, which comprise several-PeV showers and tracks. We outline current approaches to neutrino energy reconstruction and explore scenarios that might explain the apparent differences in observed event characteristics. Finally, we summarize future prospects for extreme-energy neutrino observations and their implications for astrophysical source populations and cosmogenic neutrinos.

The Spin Physics Detector (SPD) experiment at the NICA collider in JINR aims to investigate the spin structure of nucleons and spin-related phenomena. The combination of the number of background processes, the event rate and conditions for event selection makes the use of a classical trigger system impractical, requiring a triggerless data acquisition (DAQ) system. The DAQ system is designed to ensure precise time synchronization, efficient data collection, and high-throughput processing. Its architecture combines commercially available FPGA-based modules and high-speed optical interfaces with custom-developed components based on widely accessible technologies. This approach provides scalability from 180,000 at the initial stage of the experiment to more than 600,000 detector channels in the final configuration and supports data rates up to 20 GB/s or more. The modular system design ensures adaptability for future upgrades while maintaining high efficiency and reliability. Such an approach makes the DAQ system suitable for other high-rate nuclear physics experiments.

Muon imaging, especially muon scattering tomography (MST), has recently garnered significant attention. MST measures the magnitude of muon scattering angles inside an object, which depends not only on the material properties but also on the muon momentum. Due to the difficulty of simultaneous measurement of momentum, it was neglected and taken as a constant in multiple MST reconstruction algorithms. Recently, an experimental measurement scheme has emerged that is feasible in engineering, but it requires many layers of detectors to approach the true momentum. From this, we proposed both an algorithm to incorporating momentum into MST, and a scheme to determine the thresholds of Cherenkov detectors. This novel scheme, termed the "equi-percentage scheme", sets momentum thresholds for Cherenkov detector layers based on cosmic muon momentum distribution. Results showed our approach delivers noticeable enhancement in reconstructed image quality even with only two detector layers, reaching near-saturation performance with four layers. This study proves that momentum measurement significantly enhances short-duration MST, and that substantial improvement can be achieved with relatively coarse momentum measurement using 2-4 layers of Cherenkov detectors.

Observation of charmonium sequential suppression in heavy-ion collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider
The STAR Collaboration
Subjects:
Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex); High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)
We report measurements of charmonium sequential suppression in $^{96}_{44}\rm{Ru}$+$^{96}_{44}\rm{Ru}$ and $^{96}_{40}\rm{Zr}$+$^{96}_{40}\rm{Zr}$ collisions at \sqrtsnn\ = 200 GeV with the STAR experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The inclusive yield ratio of $\psi$(2S) to J/$\psi$ as a function of transverse momentum is reported, along with the centrality dependence of the double ratio, defined as the $\psi$(2S) to J/$\psi$ ratio in heavy-ion collisions relative to that in $p$+$p$ collisions. In the 0-80\% centrality class, the double ratio is found to be 0.41 $\pm$ 0.10 (stat) $\pm$ 0.03 (syst) $\pm$ 0.02 (ref), lower than unity with a significance of 5.6 standard deviations. This provides experimental evidence that $\psi$(2S) is significantly more suppressed than J/$\psi$ in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC. It is also observed that this sequential suppression pattern is more pronounced at lower transverse momentum.

One-loop Renormalization of the Type-I Seesaw Model in the On-shell Scheme

Subjects:

In a previous paper arXiv:2507.21691, we have carried out one-loop renormalization of the type-I seesaw model in the modified minimal-subtraction ($\overline{\rm MS}$) scheme. In the present one, we continue to renormalize the type-I seesaw model in the on-shell scheme. Such an investigation is mainly motivated by the fact that the on-shell scheme has been widely adopted in the renormalization of the standard electroweak theory and implemented for its precision tests. We first specify the physical parameters in the on-shell scheme, and then fix the corresponding counterterms through on-shell renormalization conditions. In the presence of massive Majorana neutrinos, we propose a practical method to determine gauge-independent counterterms for the lepton flavor mixing matrix. With the explicit counterterms in both the $\overline{\rm MS}$ and on-shell schemes, we establish the matching relations of the electric charge, physical masses and flavor mixing matrix elements between these two schemes. Our results in the present and previous papers lay the foundation for precision calculations in the type-I seesaw model.

High-precision $e^+e^-\to c\bar{c}$ data (20 final states) from the BESIII and Belle in $\sqrt{s}=3.75-4.7$ GeV are analyzed with a semi three-body unitary coupled-channel model. Vector charmonium poles are extracted from the amplitudes obtained from the fit. We find well-known $\psi$ states listed in the PDG, and also several states near open-charm thresholds. The compositeness of the near-threshold poles suggests that $\psi(4040)$ could mainly consist of a $D^*\bar{D}^*$-molecule component, rather than a conventionally accepted quark-model $\psi(3S)$ state. Also, $\psi(4230)$ and $\psi(4360)$ might be substantial mixtures of $D_1(2420)\bar{D}$, $D_1(2420)\bar{D}^*$, $D_s^*\bar{D}_s^*$, and $c\bar{c}$ components.

In this paper we carefully assess the theory prediction for $R(s)$ below charm threshold, $R_{uds}$, and address tensions with the existing data, notably with the 2021 BES-III results. We analyze the uncertainty of the perturbative QCD description in the light of renormalons making use of the large-$\beta_0$ limit and the renormalon-free gluon-condensate scheme. We provide a reliable estimate of the duality violation contributions; we show they are sizable up to $2.5$~GeV and improve the agreement between theory and data, but are negligible for higher energies. We then combine the available experimental data for $R_{uds}$ and find the data sets to be mutually compatible. Finally, we compare theory and data, both locally and in their contributions to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. Theory is compatible with the combined data but discrepancies with the BES-III data reach more than 3$\sigma$.

We consider 331 composite Higgs model (CHM3) in which the Lagrangian of the strongly coupled sector is invariant with respect to global SU(3)_C \times SU(3)\times U(1)_6 symmetry that can originate from SU(6) subgroup of E_6 and contains the gauge group of the standard model (SM) as a subgroup. The breakdown of the approximate SU(3)\times U(1)_6 symmetry down to SU(2)_W\times U(1)_Y subgroup around the scale f\sim 10 TeV results in a set of pseudo--Nambu--Goldstone bosons (pNGBs) that, in particular, involves Higgs doublet. The generation of the masses of the SM fermions in the CHM3 is discussed. We argue that an approximate discrete Z_2 symmetry may give rise to tiny masses of the left-handed neutrinos and several composite fermions with masses 1-2 TeV. The lepton and baryon asymmetries can be generated within the CHM3 via the out--of equilibrium decays of extra Majorana particle into the Higgs doublet and these composite fermions.

The observation of the electroweak production of single-top-quarks is made using 255 $\text{pb}^{-1}$ of proton-proton collision data recorded at $\sqrt{s} = 5.02$ TeV with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. An event selection is used to identify single-top-quark candidates arising from $t$-channel production with the top quark decaying semi-leptonically. Events passing the selection are then used to measure the inclusive cross-section for the combined production of single-top-quarks and antiquarks, $\sigma({tq + \bar{t}q})$, and the ratio $R_t$ between these two.

This Letter reports the first evidence of production of same-sign $W$ boson pairs where at least one of the $W$ bosons is longitudinally polarized and the most stringent constraint to date for the production of two longitudinally polarized same-sign $W$ bosons. The data set used corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 140 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, collected with the ATLAS detector during Run 2 of the Large Hadron Collider. The study is performed in final states including two same-sign leptons (electrons or muons), missing transverse momentum, and at least two jets with a large invariant mass and a large rapidity difference. Two independent fits are performed targeting the production of same-sign $W$ bosons with at least one, or two longitudinally polarized $W$ bosons. The observed (expected) significance of the production with at least one longitudinally polarized $W$ boson is 3.3 (4.0) standard deviations. An observed (expected) 95% confidence level upper limit of 0.45 (0.70) fb is reported on the fiducial production cross section of two longitudinally polarized same-sign $W$ bosons.

The extensive and ambitious physics program planned at the Future Circular Collider for electrons and positrons (FCC-ee) imposes strict constraints on detector performance. This work investigates how different detector properties impact jet flavor identification and their subsequent effects on high-profile physics analyses. Using Higgs boson coupling measurements and searches for invisible Higgs decays as benchmarks, we systematically evaluate the sensitivity of these analyses to tracker and calorimeter detector configurations. We examine variations in single-point resolution, material budget, silicon layer placement, and particle identification capabilities, quantifying their effects on flavor-tagging performance. Additionally, we present the first comprehensive study of Higgs-to-invisible decay detection using full detector simulation, providing important insights for optimizing future detector designs at lepton colliders.

Using $(2712.4\pm14.3)\times10^6$ $\psi(3686)$ events collected by the BESIII detector operating at the BEPCII storage ring, the decays $\chi_{cJ}(J=0,1,2)\rightarrow p\bar{p}\eta\eta$ are observed for the first time through the radiative transition $\psi(3686)\to\gamma\chi_{cJ}$. The statistical significances for $\chi_{cJ}$ signals are all larger than 5$\sigma$. The branching fractions of $\chi_{c0,1,2}\to p\bar{p} \eta\eta$ are determined to be $({5.75 \pm 0.59 \pm 0.42}) \times 10^{-5}$, $({1.40 \pm 0.33 \pm 0.17}) \times 10^{-5}$, and $({2.64 \pm 0.40 \pm 0.27}) \times 10^{-5}$, respectively, where the first uncertainties are statistical and the second systematic. No evident resonant structures are found in the $p\bar{p}$ and $p\eta/\bar{p}\eta$ systems.

We report a search for an axion-like particle $a$ in $B\rightarrow K^{(*)} a (\rightarrow\gamma\gamma)$ decays using data collected with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric energy electron-positron collider. The search is based on a $711 \mathrm{fb^{-1}}$ data sample collected at the $\Upsilon 4S$ resonance energy, corresponding to a sample of $772\times10^6$ $\Upsilon 4S$ events. In this study, we search for the decay of the axion-like particle into a pair of photons, $a \rightarrow \gamma\gamma$. We scan the two-photon invariant mass in the range $0.16\ \mathrm{GeV/}c^2-4.50\ \mathrm{GeV}/c^2$ for the $K$ modes and $0.16\ \mathrm{GeV/}c^2-4.20\ \mathrm{GeV}/c^2$ for the $K^{*}$ modes. No significant signal is observed in any of the modes, and 90\% confidence level upper limits are established on the coupling to the $W$ boson, $g_aW$, as a function of $a$ mass. The limits range from $3 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ to $3 \times 10^{-5} \mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$, improving the current constraints on $g_aW$ by a factor of two over the most stringent previous experimental results.

This work reinterprets so-called 'noise' in cosmic ray imaging, indicating that the data of reconstructed Points of Closest Approach (PoCA points) outside the volume of interest defined by traditional tomography methods contain valuable physical information that has been traditionally disregarded. Through analysis of data from the detection system of four resistive plate chambers (RPCs) and Monte Carlo simulations employing energy deposition weighting for coordinate determination, we confirm that these points physically originate from the interaction between muons and the material above the detection system, particularly the roof, resulting in the production of secondary particles. The research yields two principal findings: first, in the four-layer compliance measurement system, the position recording of the first layer can be from secondary particles generated by cosmic rays, while the records from the three layers below represent the actual trajectories of cosmic rays; second, the roof structure significantly impacts the distribution of PoCA points at detector positions, where quantitative analysis demonstrates a strong correlation between roof thickness and the number of reconstructed PoCA points -- a relationship that can be precisely measured through $z$-coordinate distribution analysis in specific intervals. Due to the varying performances of different roofing materials in this analytical method, this approach holds significant potential for development into a new tomography technique.

This proceeding presents recent advances in the study of hyperon physics using data from the BESIII experiment. The BESIII detector has been in full operation at the BEPCII collider since 2008, providing excellent resolution, particle identification (PID), and large coverage for both neutral and charged particles. Leveraging the outstanding capability of the detector, the BESIII experiment has collected 10 billion $J/\psi$ and 2.7 billion $\psi(3686)$ events. In recent years, BESIII has conducted a series of analyses focusing on hyperon physics, utilizing the pair production of quantum-entangled hyperon-antihyperon pairs from these charmonium decays. The transverse polarizations of the $\Lambda$, $\Sigma^{+,0}$, and $\Xi^{-,0}$ hyperons have been observed in $J/\psi$ and $\psi(3686)$ decays, providing excellent opportunities to search for the CP violation in hyperon decays. Additionally, BESIII investigates weak radiative hyperon decays, semi-leptonic hyperon decays, and hyperon-nucleon interactions.

We propose an O(100)m Atom Interferometer (AI) experiment - AICE - to be installed against a wall of the PX46 access shaft to the LHC. This experiment would probe unexplored ranges of the possible couplings of bosonic ultralight dark matter (ULDM) to atomic constituents and undertake a pioneering search for gravitational waves (GWs) at frequencies intermediate between those to which existing and planned experiments are sensitive, among other fundamental physics studies. A conceptual feasibility study showed that this AI experiment could be isolated from the LHC by installing a shielding wall in the TX46 gallery, and surveyed issues related to the proximity of the LHC machine, finding no technical obstacles. A detailed technical implementation study has shown that the preparatory civil-engineering work, installation of bespoke radiation shielding, deployment of access-control systems and safety alarms, and installation of an elevator platform could be carried out during LS3, allowing installation and operation of the AICE detector to proceed during Run 4 without impacting HL-LHC operation. These studies have established that PX46 is a uniquely promising location for an AI experiment. We foresee that, if the CERN management encourages this Letter of Intent, a significant fraction of the Terrestrial Very Long Baseline Atom Interferometer (TVLBAI) Proto-Collaboration may wish to contribute to AICE.

We study the impact of a non-uniform magnetic background field on the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) in equilibrium QCD using lattice simulations with 2+1 flavors of dynamical staggered quarks at the physical point. We show that in the presence of a non-uniform magnetic field the CME manifests itself via a localized electromagnetic current density along the direction of the field, which integrates to zero over the full volume. Our primary observable is the leading-order coefficient of the current in a chiral chemical potential expansion, which we compute for various lattice spacings and extrapolate to the continuum limit. Our findings demonstrate that, even though the global spatial average of the CME conductivity vanishes in equilibrium, steady currents still exist locally. Thus, spatially modulated magnetic fields provide a possible way of generating a non-trivial CME signal in equilibrium.

We propose to probe light-quark dipole interactions at lepton colliders using the azimuthal asymmetry of a collinear dihadron pair $(h_1h_2)$ produced in association with another hadron $h'$. This asymmetry, arising from quantum interference in the quark spin space, is exclusively sensitive to dipole interactions at the leading power of the new physics scale and simultaneously probes both the real and imaginary components of the dipole couplings. By combining all possible channels of $h'$, this method allows for disentangling the up and down quark dipole moments and has the potential to significantly strengthen current constraints by one to two orders of magnitude.

Ultra-sensitive quantification of trace radioactive krypton-85 is essential for low-background experiments, particularly for next-generation searches of galactic dark matter and neutrino physics using xenon-based time projection chambers (TPCs). While the rare gas mass spectrometer (RGMS) represents the current state-of-the-art for krypton detection in the field, we are developing a fully automated system (Auto-RGMS) to overcome the limitations of its manual operation. Auto-RGMS incorporates a robust control system for rapid measurements and minimized systematic uncertainties. A primary goal is to reach detection limits in the low parts-per-quadrillion (ppq) range for natural krypton by improving the chromatography stage to enhance the separation of krypton from xenon. Investigations into various adsorbent materials identified two candidates. HayeSep Q offers a 12-fold improvement in chromatographic resolution for xenon/krypton separation compared to the previously used adsorbent. Alternatively, HayeSep D provides a more limited improvement in resolution while allowing a higher measurement frequency because of its moderate retention-induced contamination after each measurement. By automating krypton assays and achieving ppq sensitivity, Auto-RGMS will be an indispensable tool for next-generation detectors, maximizing their scientific potential.

Recently, $B\to PP$ decays ($B = \{B^0, B^+, B_s^0\}$, $P = \{ \pi, K \}$) were analyzed under the assumption of flavor SU(3) symmetry (SU(3)$_F$). Although the individual fits to $\Delta S=0$ or $\Delta S=1$ decays are good, it was found that the combined fit is very poor: there is a $3.6\sigma$ disagreement with the SU(3)$_F$ limit of the standard model (SM$_{\rm{SU(3)}_F}$). One can remove this discrepancy by adding SU(3)$_F$-breaking effects, but 1000\% SU(3)$_F$ breaking is required. In this paper, we extend this analysis to include decays in which there is an $\eta$ and/or $\eta'$ meson in the final state. We now find that the combined fit exhibits a $4.1\sigma$ discrepancy with the SM$_{\rm{SU(3)}_F}$, and 1000\% SU(3)$_F$-breaking effects are still required to explain the data. These results are rigorous, group-theoretically -- no theoretical assumptions have been made. But when one adds some theoretical input motivated by QCD factorization, the discrepancy with the SM$_{\rm{SU(3)}_F}$ grows to $4.9\sigma$.

Within the framework of the new formalism of quantum theory - the quantum principle of least action - the initial state of the universe is determined, which is an analogue of the Hartle-Hawking no-boundary wave function. The quantum evolution of the universe is modified by additional conditions in a certain compact region of space-time, which is called the observation region. Additional conditions are Noether identities related to the general covariance of the theory and internal symmetries of matter fields. The consequences of the local law of conservation of the energy-momentum tensor of matter are considered in detail. Its consequence is the deterministic nature of the motion of the energy and momentum densities of matter in the observation area. The geometric parameters of the region boundary are also determined by the deterministic motion of the matter fields inside. The choice of boundary conditions for the energy-momentum flow at the boundary serves as a mechanism for decoherence of the quantum evolution of the universe. The result of decoherence is a certain correspondence between the final state of the universe and the state of the observer in the specified region. This correspondence allows us to formulate the extremum principle in quantum cosmology, in which the action functional constructed using the final state determines the world history of the universe as the observer sees it.

We give a pedagogical introduction to the origin of the mass of the nucleon. We first review the trace anomaly of the energy-momentum tensor, which generates most of the nucleon mass via the gluon fields and thus contributes even in the case of vanishing quark masses. We then discuss the contributions to the nucleon mass that do originate from the Higgs mechanism via the quark masses, reviewing the current status of nucleon $\sigma$-terms that encode the corresponding matrix elements.

After the successful measurement of the Higgs-like particle at the Large Hadron Collider, the determination of whether it corresponds to either the minimal version of the Higgs scalar, provided by the Standard Model, or to some new physics, so far unknown, has become a main objective of the high-energy-physics community. In particular, the investigation of the couplings of this particle with the rest of the Standard-Model field content is a central task. To this aim, in the present paper we consider a variant of the seesaw neutrino-mass-generating mechanism in which the masses of light neutrinos are generated via radiative corrections of the neutrino 2-point function. In this framework, we calculate the contributions from virtual Majorana neutrinos to the $WWh$ vertex, at one loop. A set of anomalous couplings, some of them $CP$-even and the others $CP$-odd, emerge from this calculation. We perform numerical estimations of these anomalous couplings by taking into account the role of the $WWh$ vertex in (1) $Wh$ production from $pp$ collisions and (2) in Higgs production by vector-boson fusion, occurring in some lepton collider. Our estimations show that all the generated anomalous couplings are beyond current experimental sensitivity. However, we note that $CP$-conserving anomalous couplings could be as large as $\sim10^{-3}$, which would be near the reach of the high-luminosity phase of the Large Hadron Collider. On the other hand, $CP$-odd effects, amounting to $\sim10^{-4}$, turn out to be well below expectations for the Compact Linear Collider by about 2 orders of magnitude.

The axial-vector molecular structure $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{AV}}=(B_{c}^{\ast +}B_{c}^{-} + B_{c}^{\ast - } B_{c}^{+})/2$ is explored in QCD sum rule framework. The mass and current coupling of this compound are found by means of the two-point sum rule method. It turns out that the mass of $\mathcal{M} _{\mathrm{AV}}$ is equal to $m=(12770 \pm 60)~\mathrm{MeV}$ making possible its dissociations to pairs of $J/\psi \eta_b$, $\Upsilon \eta_c$, $ B_{c}^{\ast +} B_{c}^{-}$, and $B_{c}^{\ast - } B_{c}^{+}$ mesons. The partial widths of these decay modes contain the strong couplings at $ \mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{AV}}$-meson-meson vertices which are calculated by utilizing the three-point sum rule method. The full decay width of the molecule $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{AV}}$ is formed due to these dominant processes and amounts to $\Gamma[\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{AV}}]=(93 \pm 14)~ \mathrm{MeV}$. Our results for parameters $m$ and $\Gamma[\mathcal{M}_{ \mathrm{AV}}]$ of the hadronic molecule $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{AV}}$ are useful for experimental studies of various fully heavy four-quark mesons.

Electron-positron colliders operating in the GeV region of center-of-mass energies or the Tau-Charm energy region, have been proven to enable competitive frontier research, due to its several unique features. With the progress of high energy physics in the last two decades, a new-generation Tau-Charm factory, Super Tau Charm Facility (STCF) has been actively promoting by the particle physics community in China. STCF holds great potential to address fundamental questions such as the essence of color confinement and the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe in the next decades. The main design goals of STCF are with a center-of-mass energy ranging from 2 to 7 GeV and a peak luminosity surpassing 5*10^34 cm^-2s^-1 that is optimized at a center-of-mass energy of 4 GeV, which is about 50 times that of the currently operating Tau-Charm factory - BEPCII. The STCF accelerator is composed of two main parts: a double-ring collider with the crab-waist collision scheme and an injector that provides top-up injections for both electron and positron beams. As a typical third-generation electron-positron circular collider, the STCF accelerator faces many challenges in both accelerator physics and technology. In this paper, the conceptual design of the STCF accelerator complex is presented, including the ongoing efforts and plans for technological R&D, as well as the required infrastructure. The STCF project aims to secure support from the Chinese central government for its construction during the 15th Five-Year Plan (2026-2030) in China.
