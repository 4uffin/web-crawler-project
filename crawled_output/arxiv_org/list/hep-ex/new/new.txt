Title:
Studies of the tracking and identification efficiencies of electrons and positrons at BESIII
Xinyu Chai, Mengzhen Wang, Xiaobin Ji, Shengsen Sun, Dayong Wang
Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)
The efficiencies for electron and positron tracking and identification in the BESIII experiment are investigated with the radiative Bhabha process $e^+e^-\rightarrow e^+e^-\gamma$ from the data samples collected at the center-of-mass energies of 3.08 GeV and 3.097 GeV. The relative differences between data and MC associated with tracking and identification efficiencies of electrons and positrons, as well as the corresponding correction factors are determined. It turns out the relative differences of tracking efficiency and particle identification efficiency after correction are mostly less than 0.5$\%$ for transverse momenta $p_T>0.4$ GeV and for the entire momentum region, respectively.

We review recent heavy quarkonium measurements in $pp$, $p\mathrm{Pb}$, and $\mathrm{PbPb}$ collisions at the LHC by the ALICE, ATLAS, CMS, and LHCb collaborations using Run 2 and early Run 3 data. Production studies include present differential cross sections and polarization measurements of charmonium and bottomonium, providing precise tests of QCD theoretical calculations and unveiling symmetry relations among spin and orbital configurations. Notably, a $t\bar{t}$ quasi bound state has been observed at the LHC recently. Suppression analyses quantify the sequential melting of bottomonium states in $\mathrm{PbPb}$ collisions, serving as a probe of the deconfined quark gluon plasma. Cold nuclear matter effects are constrained through comparisons of quarkonium yields in $p\mathrm{Pb}$ and $pp$ collisions. Furthermore, multi quarkonium investigations observe di and tri quarkonium production processes and resonances, exploring multi parton interactions and the symmetry structure underlying exotic hadron states.

Commissioning and Testing of IceAct Telescopes at the IceCube Neutrino Observatory

Subjects:
Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)
IceAct is an array of imaging air Cherenkov telescopes located at the ice surface above the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. Each telescope features a silicon photomultiplier based 61 pixel camera and a Fresnel-lens as imaging optic, resulting in a 12-degree field of view. The design is optimized to be operated in harsh environments, particularly at the South Pole. The setup will consist of seven telescopes in a so-called fly's eye configuration, increasing the field of view to 36^\circ, and an additional telescope 200m apart for stereoscopic observations. Rigorous testing procedures have been performed before deployment to ensure that operation under these conditions is possible, e.g. night sky observations and cold temperature tests. Furthermore, on-site calibrations are used to verify the accuracy and reliability of the installation. We derive the geometric alignment of each IceAct telescope by comparing the directional reconstruction of muons measured with IceCube to the corresponding primary particle direction reconstruction from IceAct. This contribution presents these testing procedures. Additionally, we present the on-site alignment calibration, including a Graph Neural Network reconstruction for the primary particle direction in IceAct, verification on Monte Carlo simulation, and the application to a commissioning dataset.

$Ξ_c \to Ξ$ Semileptonic Decays: An LCSR View on the Experiment-Lattice Tension

Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex); High Energy Physics - Lattice (hep-lat)
We present a light-cone QCD sum rule analysis of the semileptonic decays of $\Xi_c$ baryons, focusing on the channels $\Xi_c^0 \to \Xi^- \ell^+ \nu_\ell$, and $\Xi_c^+ \to \Xi^0 \ell^+ \nu_\ell$. The transition form factors are calculated within the light-cone QCD sum rules framework, using the distribution amplitudes of the heavy $\Xi_c$ baryons. The obtained form factors are then used to compute the differential and total decay widths, as well as the branching fractions. Our numerical results for the branching fractions are $\mathcal{B}(\Xi_c^0 \to \Xi^- \ell^+ \nu_\ell) = (3.73 \pm 1.04)~\%$ , $\mathcal{B}(\Xi_c^0 \to \Xi^- \mu^+ \nu_\mu) = (3.59 \pm 1.01)~\%$, $\mathcal{B}(\Xi_c^+ \to \Xi^0 \ell^+ \nu_\ell) = (11.2 \pm 3.25)~\%$, and $\mathcal{B}(\Xi_c^+ \to \Xi^0 \mu^+ \nu_\mu) = (10.8 \pm 3.13)~\%$. These results are in good agreement with recent lattice QCD calculations, while being larger than the current experimental measurements and differing from the predictions of other theoretical approaches.

A Differentiable Surrogate Model for the Generation of Radio Pulses from In-Ice Neutrino Interactions

Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)
The planned IceCube-Gen2 radio neutrino detector at the South Pole will enhance the detection of cosmic ultra-high-energy neutrinos. It is crucial to utilize the available time until construction to optimize the detector design. A fully differentiable pipeline, from signal generation to detector response, would allow for the application of gradient descent techniques to explore the parameter space of the detector. In our work, we focus on the aspect of signal generation, and propose a modularized deep learning architecture to generate radio signals from in-ice neutrino interactions conditioned on the shower energy and viewing angle. The model is capable of generating differentiable signals with amplitudes spanning multiple orders of magnitude, as well as consistently producing signals corresponding to the same underlying event for different viewing angles. The modularized approach ensures physical consistency of the samples and leads to advantageous computational properties when using the model as part of a bigger optimization pipeline.

Higgs boson production through gluon fusion in association with two jets is an irreducible background to Higgs boson production through vector boson fusion, one of the most important channels for analyzing and understanding the Higgs boson properties at the Large Hadron Collider. Despite a range of available simulation tools, precise predictions for the corresponding final states are notoriously hard to achieve. Using state-of-the-art fixed-order calculations as the baseline for a comparison, we perform a detailed study of similarities and differences in existing event generators. We provide consistent setups for the simulations that can be used to obtain identical parametric precision in various programs used by experiments. We find that NLO calculations for the two-jet final state are essential to achieve reliable predictions.

We analyze the potential of rare charm decays as probes of new physics at a high-luminosity flavor facility operating at the $Z$ pole, such as the FCC-ee or CEPC. In particular, we identify clean null-test observables in $D^0 \to \pi^+ \pi^- \nu\bar{\nu}$ and in polarized $\Lambda_c^+ \to p \ell^+ \ell^-$ decays with $\ell=e, \mu$. Complementarity with the LHC and HL-LHC flavor programs arises from the characteristic features of a Tera-$Z$ environment: the capability to study missing-energy modes and charm production with significant polarization. We improve the theoretical description of $D^0 \to \pi^+ \pi^- \nu\bar{\nu}$ decays and work out the phenomenology of polarization-induced null-test observables in $\Lambda_c^+ \to p \ell^+ \ell^-$ decays. In regions of dilepton mass near the $\phi$ resonance, polarization asymmetries can reach $O(5 \%)$ for muons and $O(14 \%)$ for electrons times the $\Lambda_c^+$ polarization. We also point out synergies between the dineutrino and the dilepton modes using the SMEFT framework of heavy new physics. Using the IDEA detector concept at FCC-ee, we find in simulation studies that dineutrino branching fractions as low as $\sim 2 \times 10^{-7}$ can be probed, which reaches well into the parameter space of new physics, and also allows for discrimination of lepton flavor structures. Furthermore, the measurement of asymmetries in $\Lambda_c^+ \to p \mu^+ \mu^-$ at $O(1 \%)$ will be possible. Similar sensitivities are expected for dielectron final states, although robust predictions will require further dedicated studies.

We carry out an Effective Field Theory (EFT) study of the $pp \to \bar{t} t Zh$ process in the $4b + 3 \ell + \ge 2j + \slashed{E}_T$ final state. This process can uniquely probe the $\bar{t} t Zh$ couplings arising from higher dimensional EFT operators and can also provide bounds on $\bar{t} t Z$ coupling deviations. We highlight the importance of the proposed proton-proton Future Circular Collider (FCC-$hh$) to study this process and then perform a complete collider analysis by examining the relevant background processes. This allows us to determine the FCC-$hh$ sensitivity to probe anomalous $\bar{t} t Zh$ couplings.

Gravitational Wave Signature and the Nature of Neutrino Masses: Majorana, Dirac, or Pseudo-Dirac?

The fermionic nature of neutrinos and the origin of their tiny masses remain unresolved issues in particle physics, intrinsically connected to lepton number symmetry-conserved for Dirac, violated for Majorana, and effectively pseudo-Dirac when global symmetries invoked for conservation are broken by quantum gravity. We investigate whether distinctive gravitational-wave (GW) signatures can illuminate the nature of neutrino masses and their underlying symmetries, particularly in scenarios where Yukawa couplings are not unnaturally small. To this end, we consider the minimal $B-L$ gauge extension of the Standard Model, where quantum numbers of beyond-SM states determine the neutrino nature and the scale of spontaneous $B-L$ breaking governs mass generation. In this framework, we show that neutrinos yield characteristic GW spectra: Majorana neutrinos with high-scale breaking ($\sim 10^{14}$ GeV) produce local cosmic strings and a flat spectrum across broad frequencies, Dirac neutrinos with low-scale breaking ($\sim 10^{7}$ GeV) generate peaked spectra from first-order phase transitions, and pseudo-Dirac scenarios give kink-like features from domain wall annihilation.

A search is performed for pairs of light pseudoscalar bosons (a) produced from decays of the 125 GeV Higgs boson ($\text{h}_{125}$). The analysis is based on publicly available data collected in 2016 by the CMS experiment at the LHC in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The amount of data analyzed corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 16.4 $\text{fb}^{-1}$. The analysis explores for the first time at the LHC the final state exhibiting two muons and two c-quarks, which originate from flavor-asymmetric decays of the pseudoscalar pair. The search probes the pseudoscalar boson mass interval comprised between 4 and 11 GeV, which represents a region where the light bosons exhibit a considerable Lorentz boost, and thus their decay products overlap. No significant deviation from the standard model expectation is observed. Model-independent upper limits at 95% confidence level are set on the product of the cross section and branching fraction for the ${\text{h}_{125} \rightarrow \text{a}\text{a} \rightarrow \mu^{-}\mu^{+} c\bar{c}}$ process relative to the standard model Higgs boson production cross section, reaching a minimum value close to $3.3 \times 10^{-4}$. The results are interpreted in the context of two Higgs doublets plus singlet models and compared to existing experimental results covering other decay channels. The exclusion limits obtained by this search improve the current constraints set by various LHC searches in scenarios where the coupling of the light boson to up-type quarks is enhanced.

Title:
Hybrid-Graph Neural Network Method for Muon Fast Reconstruction in Neutrino Telescopes
Cen Mo, Liang Li
Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)
Fast and accurate muon reconstruction is crucial for neutrino telescopes to improve experimental sensitivity and enable online triggering. This paper introduces a Hybrid-Graph Neural Network (GNN) method tailored for efficient muon track reconstruction, leveraging the robustness of GNNs alongside traditional physics-based approaches. The "LITE GNN model" achieves a runtime of 0.19-0.29 ms per event on GPUs, offering a three orders of magnitude speedup compared to traditional likelihood-based methods while maintaining a high reconstruction accuracy. For high-energy muons (10-100 TeV), the median angular error is approximately 0.1 degrees, with errors in reconstructed Cherenkov photon emission positions being below 3-5 meters, depending on the GNN model used. Furthermore, the Semi-GNN method offers a mechanism to assess the quality of event reconstruction, enabling the identification and exclusion of poorly reconstructed events. These results establish the GNN-based approach as a promising solution for next-generation neutrino telescope data reconstruction.

The electromagnetic structure of the nucleon can be determined from the scattering of electrons off a nucleon target. However, to study its axial structure, neutrino beams are required. The results from these experiments should be extrapolated to zero energy-momentum transfers to access the static properties of the nucleon. For baryons with strange quarks, hyperons, the static limit can instead be approached in semi-leptonic decays, which give direct access to the weak magnetism and axial-vector coupling strengths that are inaccessible in electromagnetic interactions. The axial-vector coupling as while weak magnetism coupling and the overall normalization, given by form factor $f_1$, are being determined with increased precision from the theory of strong interactions using a first principles formulation on the space--time lattice. Furthermore, the probability of the semi-leptonic hyperon decay is approximately proportional to $|V_{us}|^2\cdot (f_1^2+3g_1^2)$, where $V_{us}$ is the CKM matrix element responsible for the transition between an $s$ and a $u$ quark. Current determinations of $|V_{us}|$ come from kaon decays, but the results are not consistent and could indicate a deviation from CKM matrix unitarity, a tell-tale sign of physics beyond the Standard Model (SM) of elementary particles. Here we determine the absolute branching fraction and weak coupling strengths for $\Lambda\to p e^-\bar\nu_e$, and $\bar \Lambda\to \bar p e^+\nu_e$. These observables combined with form factors determined from first-principle lattice QCD calculations allow for the extraction of the $|V_{us}|$ value. We demonstrate how $|V_{us}|$ can be extracted with increasing sensitivity using polarized hyperons from entangled, baryon-antibaryon pairs, thus enabling a complementary road to that of meson decays. In addition, the presented experimental method can be used for other semileptonic decays of baryons.

Incoherent J/$\psi$ photoproduction in heavy ion ultraperipheral collisions (UPCs) provides a sensitive probe of localized, fluctuating gluonic structures within heavy nuclei. This study reports the first measurement of the photon-nucleon center-of-mass energy ($W_{\gamma\mathrm{N}}$) dependence of this process in PbPb UPCs at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of 5.02 TeV, using 1.52 nb$^{-1}$ of data recorded by the CMS experiment. The measurement covers a wide $W_{\gamma\mathrm{N}}$ range of $\approx$ 40-400 GeV, probing gluons carrying a fraction $x$ of nucleon momentum down to an unexplored region of 6.5 $\times$ 10$^{-5}$. Compared to baseline predictions neglecting nuclear effects, the measured cross sections exhibit significantly greater suppression at lower $x$. Additionally, the ratio of incoherent to coherent photoproduction is found to be constant across the probed $W_{\gamma\mathrm{N}}$ and $x$ range, disfavoring the establishment of the black disk limit. This study provides critical insights into the $x$-dependent evolution of fluctuating gluonic structures within nuclei and calls for further advancements in theoretical models incorporating nuclear shadowing and gluon saturation.

The ALICE Collaboration is planning to construct a new detector (ALICE 3) aiming at exploiting the potential of the high-luminosity Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The new detector will allow ALICE to participate in LHC Run 5 scheduled from 2036 to 2041. The muon-identifier subsystem (MID) is part of the ALICE 3 reference detector layout. The MID will consist of a standard magnetic iron absorber ($\approx4$ nuclear interaction lengths) followed by muon chambers. The baseline option for the MID chambers considers plastic scintillation bars equipped with wave-length shifting fibers and readout with silicon photomultipliers. This paper reports on the performance of a MID chamber prototype using 3 GeV/$c$ pion- and muon-enriched beams delivered by the CERN Proton Synchrotron (PS). The prototype was built using extruded plastic scintillator produced by FNAL-NICADD (Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory - Northern Illinois Center for Accelerator and Detector Development). The prototype was experimentally evaluated using varying absorber thicknesses (60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 cm) to assess its performance. The analysis was performed using Machine Learning techniques and the performance was validated with GEANT 4 simulations. Potential improvements in both hardware and data analysis are discussed.

Title:
Criterion for the Existence of the $G(3900)$ Resonance
Yin Huang, Xurong Chen
Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)
About 18 years ago, the BABAR and the Belle Collaborations reported evidence for a new $c\bar{c}$ structure near $3900~\mathrm{MeV}$ in $e^{+}e^{-} \to D\bar{D}$, triggering debate over whether it represents a genuine hadronic state or arises from interference effects and the opening of the $D^{*}\bar{D}$ threshold. The issue remained unsettled until 2024, when BESIII, with an enlarged $e^{+}e^{-} \to D\bar{D}$ sample, confirmed the presence of the $G(3900)$ structure, reviving discussion of its nature. Although it has been proposed as a $P$-wave $D\bar{D}^{*}$ molecular state, no consensus has emerged, and interference effects remain a plausible explanation. In this Letter, we show that analyzing the $e^{+}e^{-}\to D\bar{D}$ cross section as a function of the transverse momentum of the final-state $D$ meson reveals a prominent Jacobian peak. This feature cannot be generated by interference effects alone and thus provides direct evidence for the existence of $G(3900)$. Moreover, the peak position is highly sensitive to the actual mass of $G(3900)$, offering a precise determination method. Our results further disfavor the interpretation of $G(3900)$ as a $D\bar{D}^{*}$ molecular state, pointing instead to alternative internal structures. The criterion illustrated by $G(3900)$ can be extended to other hadronic systems, offering a powerful tool to identify genuine resonances.
