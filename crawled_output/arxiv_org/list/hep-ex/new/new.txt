Title:
NuGraph2 with Explainability: Post-hoc Explanations for Geometric Neural Network Predictions

Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)
With the growing popularity of artificial intelligence used for scientific applications, the ability of attribute a result to a reasoning process from the network is in high demand for robust scientific generalizations to hold. In this work we aim to motivate the need for and demonstrate the use of post-hoc explainability methods when applied to AI methods used in scientific applications. To this end, we introduce explainability add-ons to the existing graph neural network (GNN) for neutrino tagging, NuGraph2. The explanations take the form of a suite of techniques examining the output of the network (node classifications) and the edge connections between them, and probing of the latent space using novel general-purpose tools applied to this network. We show how none of these methods are singularly sufficient to show network "understanding", but together can give insights into the processes used in classification. While these methods are tested on the NuGraph2 application, they can be applied to a broad range of networks, not limited to GNNs.

Title:
NuGraph2 with Context--Aware Inputs: Physics--Inspired Improvements in Semantic Segmentation
Vitor F. Grizzi, Margaret Voetberg, Giuseppe Cerati, Hadi Meidani
Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)
Graph neural networks have recently shown strong promise for event reconstruction tasks in Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers, yet their performance remains limited for underrepresented classes of particles, such as Michel electrons. In this work, we investigate physics-informed strategies to improve semantic segmentation within the NuGraph2 architecture. We explore three complementary approaches: (i) enriching the input representation with context-aware features derived from detector geometry and track continuity, (ii) introducing auxiliary decoders to capture class-level correlations, and (iii) incorporating energy-based regularization terms motivated by Michel electron energy distributions. Experiments on MicroBooNE public datasets show that physics-inspired feature augmentation yields the largest gains, particularly boosting Michel electron precision and recall by disentangling overlapping latent space regions. In contrast, auxiliary decoders and energy-regularization terms provided limited improvements, partly due to the hit-level nature of NuGraph2, which lacks explicit particle- or event-level representations. Our findings highlight that embedding physics context directly into node-level inputs is more effective than imposing task-specific auxiliary losses, and suggest that future hierarchical architectures such as NuGraph3, with explicit particle- and event-level reasoning, will provide a more natural setting for advanced decoders and physics-based regularization.

Title:
3D Tracking with the CYGNO/INITIUM experiment
David José Gaspar Marques

PhD Dissertation in the field of Astroparticle Physics; Location: Gran Sasso Science Institute (Italy); Supervisor: Elisabetta Baracchini
Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)
The nature of dark matter (DM) remains one of the most fundamental open questions in physics. Among the main DM candidates are Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), expected to interact with matter through scattering. Directional detection offers a way to overcome the limits of conventional WIMP searches - in particular the neutrino fog - by identifying the direction of nuclear recoils (NR) and thus inferring the incoming WIMP direction. Earth's motion through the Galaxy produces an apparent WIMP wind, resulting in an anisotropic distribution of recoil tracks that no background can mimic. This thesis contributes to this effort through the development of 3D reconstruction techniques for the CYGNO/INITIUM experiment. CYGNO operates with a He:CF4 gas mixture at 1 ATM and triple-GEM amplification, producing scintillation light which is read by CMOS sensors and photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). A 3D reconstruction method was developed by combining CMOS (XY) and PMT (Z) data. A dedicated framework extracts PMT waveform information, synchronizes it with CMOS data, and reconstructs the full 3D topology and direction of tracks. The analysis focused on alpha particles, whose ionization profiles resemble WIMP-induced NRs. Alpha tracks were reconstructed with accurate direction and head-tail determination. The study characterized alpha backgrounds in LIME, confirming the presence of Rn-222 in the gas. Angular and spatial distributions also revealed U-238 and Th-232 contamination in the GEMs, cathode, and field cage. These findings clarified discrepancies with MC simulations and guided design improvements for CYGNO-04. Finally, first steps toward Negative Ion Drift (NID) operation with the MANGO prototype are presented, including a novel analysis of the first-ever NID PMT waveforms observed. These results demonstrate the potential of CYGNO for directional, low-background dark matter detection.

Diffusion of $^{210}\text{Pb}$ and $^{210}\text{Po}$ in Nylon

High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)
Radon and its progeny constitute a major source of background in rare-event physics experiments, such as those searching for dark matter, neutrinos, and neutrinoless double beta decay, due to their origin as unavoidable decay products of natural uranium. In particular, $^{222}$Rn and its long-lived daughter $^{210}$Pb can diffuse from detector material surfaces, resulting in sustained background contributions. To investigate this process, a system was developed using a controlled radon source, a vacuum chamber with a high electric field, and a thin Nylon-6 film to enable deposition of radon progeny onto the film surface. Nylon-6 was selected for the initial measurement given its history in low-background experiments. We intend to systematically study diffusion in various polymers in the future. Our setup allowed for controlled study of the diffusion behavior of $^{210}$Pb and its daughter $^{210}$Po under varying humidity conditions. Our results show that both $^{210}$Pb and $^{210}$Po diffuse significantly in nylon under high relative humidity, which can potentially lead to internal contamination and increased background in low-background detectors. The diffusivity of $^{210}$Pb was found to be lower than 1.14 $\times$ 10$^{-15}$ cm$^2$/s at 40$\%$ relative humidity (RH), and to be (4.03 $\pm$ 1.01) $\times$ 10$^{-13}$ cm$^2$/s at 95$\%$ RH. The diffusivity of $^{210}$Po at 95$\%$ RH was measured to be (3.94 $\pm$ 0.98) $\times$ 10$^{-13}$ cm$^2$/s. These findings underscore the importance of controlling environmental humidity and material exposure to radon in the design of ultra-low background experiments.

In the context of nucleon structure studies, Generalized Parton Distributions (GPDs) are crucial for understanding the correlation between the longitudinal momentum and the transverse position of partons inside the nucleon. A privileged channel for GPD studies is the Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering (DVCS) process, whose experimental observables can provide access to GPDs through spin-dependent asymmetries. Although detecting all final state particles is preferred for selecting DVCS events, DVCS identification can be ensured by requiring the detection of only two final state particles, as the missing particle can be reconstructed from conservation laws. In this work, we present preliminary Beam Spin Asymmetry and cross-section measurements of proton-DVCS in the $e\gamma$ topology from experimental data taken by the CLAS12 detector at Jefferson Lab. Moreover, we show that relying on $e\gamma$ detection and Machine Learning techniques boosts statistics and gives access to a wider phase space than the proton-detected topology, providing the first time CLAS12 measurement of this observable in the $-t$ range below $0.1$ GeV$^{2}$.

We propose an O(100)m Atom Interferometer (AI) experiment to be installed against a wall of the PX46 access shaft to the LHC. This experiment would probe unexplored ranges of the possible couplings of bosonic ultralight dark matter (ULDM) to atomic constituents and undertake a pioneering search for gravitational waves (GWs) at frequencies intermediate between those to which existing and planned experiments are sensitive, among other fundamental physics studies. A conceptual feasibility study showed that this AI experiment could be isolated from the LHC by installing a shielding wall in the TX46 gallery, and surveyed issues related to the proximity of the LHC machine, finding no technical obstacles. A detailed technical implementation study has shown that the preparatory civil-engineering work, installation of bespoke radiation shielding, deployment of access-control systems and safety alarms, and installation of an elevator platform could be carried out during LS3, allowing installation and operation of the detector to proceed during Run 4 without impacting HL-LHC operation. These studies have established that PX46 is a uniquely promising location for an AI experiment. We foresee that, if the CERN management encourages this Letter of Intent, a significant fraction of the Terrestrial Very Long Baseline Atom Interferometer (TVLBAI) Proto-Collaboration may wish to contribute to such an AI experiment.

In recent years, the Super-Kamiokande (SK) experiment has contributed to multi-messenger astronomy by searching for neutrino signals in coincidence with gravitational wave events. The fourth observing run (O4) of the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA collaborations started in May 2023. During the initial phase, known as O4a, LIGO identified 81 gravitational wave candidates. Neutrino follow-up searches with O4a were performed in SK. While no significant signal was observed, flux limits were computed.

DeepMET: Improving missing transverse momentum estimation with a deep neural network
CMS Collaboration

High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)
At hadron colliders, the net transverse momentum of particles that do not interact with the detector (missing transverse momentum, $\vec{p}_\mathrm{T}^\text{miss}$) is a crucial observable in many analyses. In the standard model, $\vec{p}_\mathrm{T}^\text{miss}$ originates from neutrinos. Many beyond-the-standard-model particles, such as dark matter candidates, are also expected to leave the experimental apparatus undetected. This paper presents a novel $\vec{p}_\mathrm{T}^\text{miss}$ estimator, DeepMET, which is based on deep neural networks that were developed by the CMS Collaboration at the LHC. The DeepMET algorithm produces a weight for each reconstructed particle based on its properties. The estimator is based on the negative vector sum of the weighted transverse momenta of all reconstructed particles in an event. Compared with other estimators currently employed by CMS, DeepMET improves the $\vec{p}_\mathrm{T}^\text{miss}$ resolution by 10$-$30%, shows improvement for a wide range of final states, is easier to train, and is more resilient against the effects of additional proton-proton interactions accompanying the collision of interest.

We use a cavity optomechanical accelerometer to perform a resonant search for ultralight dark matter at acoustic frequencies near 39 kHz (a particle mass of $0.16$ neV/$c^2$). The accelerometer is based on a Si$_3$N$_4$ membrane, cryogenically cooled to 4 K, with photothermal heating employed to scan the resonance frequency by $10^2$ detector linewidths. Leveraging shot-noise-limited displacement readout and radiation pressure feedback cooling, we realize an acceleration resolution of $\sim 10\;\text{n}g_0/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ over a bandwidth of $30$ Hz near the fundamental test mass resonance. We find no evidence of a dark matter signal and infer an upper bound on the coupling to normal matter that is several orders of magnitude above the stringent bounds set by equivalence principle experiments. We outline a path toward novel dark matter constraints in future experiments by exploiting arrays of mass-loaded optomechanical sensors at lower temperature probed with distributed squeezed light.

Dark matter remains a mystery in fundamental physics. The only evidence for dark matter's existence is from gravitational interactions. We constructed a precision torsion balance experiment to search for non-gravitational, long-range interactions between ordinary matter in our lab and the Milky Way's dark matter. We find no evidence of such interaction and set strict upper bounds on its strength. These results suggest that dark matter only interacts gravitationally over long distances and constrains a variety of dark matter theories.

Towards a precise measurement of the $Λ_c^+/D^0$ ratio at RHIC

sPHENIX is a next-generation experiment at RHIC for jet and heavy-flavor physics which was fully commissioned during 2023 and 2024. Using its novel streaming-readout-capable, precision tracking system, sPHENIX collected 100 billion unbiased $p$$+$$p$ collisions, and a further sample of minimum-bias Au-Au collisions, in Run-24. A key measurement of the sPHENIX heavy flavor physics program is the comparison of $\Lambda_c^+$ to $D^0$ differential yields in both Au+Au and $p$$+$$p$ collisions, which probes questions related to the hadronization of heavy-flavor baryons compared to mesons in the Quark-Gluon Plasma medium and in vacuum. At RHIC energies, there is no previous measurement of the $\Lambda_c^+/D^0$ baseline in $p$$+$$p$ collisions, modern Monte Carlo event generators give widely different predictions, and the ratio in Au+Au is only poorly known. These proceedings present the status of measurement from sPHENIX of the $\Lambda_c^+/D^0$ ratio in $p$$+$$p$ collisions.

The Direct Detection (DD) experiments are vital for probing the particle nature of the Dark Matter (DM). However, in the absence of a scattering event, DD searches result in stringent bounds on the corresponding parameter space. The paper has considered a $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$-extension of the Standard Model (SM) and augmented the particle spectrum with $SU(2)_L$-singlet vector-like leptons and scalars. Further, a discrete $Z_2$ symmetry stabilizes the lightest SM-singlet vector-like lepton as the viable DM candidate. In the proposed model, amplitude-level cancellation can be achieved for both DM-electron and DM-quark scatterings, leading to a trivial explanation for the continuous null results in the DD experiments. The framework can also induce one-loop corrections to the lepton anomalous magnetic moments and $Z\ell^+\ell^-$ couplings. The experimental bounds on the $Z\to\ell^+\ell^-$ decays are instrumental in constraining the model parameters. Particularly, using the $Z\to\tau^+\tau^-$ decay, a stronger exclusion limit can be imposed on the $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ parameter space. Future experimental updates on the $(g-2)_\ell$, $Z\to\ell^+\ell^-$ decays and improved bounds on the $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ theory can be crucial to test the proposed model. Moreover, future DD experiments searching for a DM-muon scattering might be significant to probe the considered DM-SM interaction.

The electromagnetic and gravitational form factors of the nucleon determined by quark and gluon contributions are calculated using the momentum transfer dependence of generalized parton distributions with different forms of parton distribution functions obtained by various Collaborations. The power forms of gravitational form factors of quarks and gluons are examined. It is shown that the gluon gravitational radius of the nucleon is comparable to the electromagnetic radius of the proton; however, the quark gravitational radius of the nucleon is less than its electromagnetic radius. It is shown that the gluon gravitational form factor drops faster than the quark gravitational form factor at large transfer momenta and corresponds to the triple form.

Calorimeters operating in high-radiation environments are susceptible to damage, leading to increased noise that can significantly degrade energy resolution. A common way to mitigate noise is to apply a higher energy threshold on the cells, typically set a few standard deviations above the noise level. However, this method risks discarding cells with genuine energy deposits, worsening the energy resolution. In this paper we explore various machine learning (ML) algorithms that can replace a rigid threshold on the reconstructed cell energy and we demonstrate the improvement in calorimetric energy reconstruction and energy resolution that these ML methods can achieve in such challenging conditions.

We report the first determination of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix elements $|V_{cs}|$ and $|V_{cd}|$ from a global fit to data from inclusive and sum-of-exclusive charm decays. Simultaneously, the heavy quark expansion parameters are determined, and they are in good agreement with results from the literature, validating the robustness of this work. With the current precision, our determined value for $|V_{cs}|$ is consistent with the world-average value extracted from exclusive charm decay processes, while a tension of approximately $3\sigma$ is observed for $|V_{cd}|$ when compared to its exclusive world-average counterpart.

Electron-positron colliders operating in the GeV region of center-of-mass energies or the Tau-Charm energy region, have been proven to enable competitive frontier research, due to its several unique features. With the progress of high energy physics in the last two decades, a new-generation Tau-Charm factory, Super Tau Charm Facility (STCF) has been actively promoting by the particle physics community in China. STCF holds great potential to address fundamental questions such as the essence of color confinement and the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe in the next decades. The main design goals of STCF are with a center-of-mass energy ranging from 2 to 7 GeV and a peak luminosity surpassing 5*10^34 cm^-2s^-1 that is optimized at a center-of-mass energy of 4 GeV, which is about 50 times that of the currently operating Tau-Charm factory - BEPCII. The STCF accelerator is composed of two main parts: a double-ring collider with the crab-waist collision scheme and an injector that provides top-up injections for both electron and positron beams. As a typical third-generation electron-positron circular collider, the STCF accelerator faces many challenges in both accelerator physics and technology. In this paper, the conceptual design of the STCF accelerator complex is presented, including the ongoing efforts and plans for technological R&D, as well as the required infrastructure. The STCF project aims to secure support from the Chinese central government for its construction during the 15th Five-Year Plan (2026-2030) in China.

The Large Particle Physics Laboratory Directors Group (LDG) established the Working Group (WG) on the Sustainability Assessment of Future Accelerators in 2024 with the mandate to develop guidelines and a list of key parameters for the assessment of the sustainability of future accelerators in particle physics. While focused on accelerator projects, much of the work will also be relevant to other present and upcoming research infrastructures. The development and continuous update of such a framework aim to enable a coherent communication amongst scientists and adequately convey the information to a broader set of stakeholders. This document outlines the key findings and recommendations of the LDG Sustainability WG and provides a summary of current best practices aimed at enabling sustainable accelerator-based research infrastructures. Not all sustainability topics are addressed at the same level. The assessment process is complex, largely under development and a homogeneous evaluation of all the aspects requires a strategy to be developed and implemented over time.

In an ultra-peripheral collision, a photon can interact with a gluon in the target nucleus and produce a pair of charm quarks, while the target nucleus breaks up (inelastic scattering). These charm quarks then fragment and are observed as open charm hadrons or vector mesons. This process has been used in e$\unicode{x2014}$p collisions to set stringent limits on the proton gluon distribution at low-$x$. The current measurements can provide similar constraints on the much less known nuclear gluon distributions. ALICE has measured the transverse momentum distribution of inelastically photoproduced $\text{D}^0$ at midrapidity, in Pb$\unicode{x2014}$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\text{NN}}$=5.36 TeV. The distribution is measured down to $p_\text{T}$=0 for the first time. The results are compared to model calculations.

Machine learning (ML) in high-energy physics (HEP) has moved in the LHC era from an internal detail of experiment software, to an unavoidable public component of many physics data-analyses. Scientific reproducibility thus requires that it be possible to accurately and stably preserve the behaviours of these, sometimes very complex algorithms. We present and document the petrifyML package, which provides missing mechanisms to convert configurations from commonly used HEP ML tools to either the industry-standard ONNX format or to native Python or C++ code, enabling future re-use and re-interpretation of many ML-based experimental studies.

We investigate the dark parton shower effects in the direct detection of cosmic-ray boosted dark matter (CRDM), focusing on a dark photon-mediated model with fermionic dark matter-electron interactions. Utilizing a Monte Carlo framework to incorporate the Sudakov form factors and kinematic dipole recoil schemes, we simulate the CRDM energy spectrum evolution under the dark sector splitting. Our results reveal a significant energy-dependent modification of the CRDM flux. For a 1 keV dark matter (DM) mass and a coupling of $g_D=3$, the CRDM flux can be enhanced by a factor up to 1.12 in the $\mathcal{O}(10^{-2} \sim 1)$ MeV energy range for $2m_\chi \lesssim m_{A^\prime} \lesssim 10^{-2}$ MeV, while it is suppressed by more than $50\%$ at energy around 100 MeV for $m_{A^\prime} \lesssim 10^{-3}$ MeV. We then translate these effects into the experimental sensitivities for PandaX-4T, Super-Kamiokande, and JUNO. At $m_{A^\prime} = 10^{-3}$ MeV and $g_D=3$, the bounds on the kinetic mixing parameter $\epsilon^2$ are relaxed by factors of 1.02, 1.6 and 1.4, respectively. Finally, we demonstrate that the parameter space considered is consistent with those astrophysical constraints on dark matter self-interactions from observations of the Bullet Cluster.

The mass and width of the lightest scalar open-charm state listed in the Review of Particle Physics, the $D_0^\ast(2300)$, are in puzzling tension with predictions from unitarized chiral perturbation theory (UChPT) and lattice QCD, which favor a lighter state at around $2100$ MeV. However, to date, no direct experimental evidence for this lighter state exists. In an effort to facilitate a direct observation, we introduce angular asymmetries of $B\rightarrow D \pi \ell \nu$ decays that allow for a direct extraction of the $D\pi$ S-wave phase shift and discuss a novel measurement strategy for the Belle II experiment. We conduct a sensitivity study, finding that the Belle II experiment can determine the pole location with sufficient precision to firmly establish the $D_0^\ast(2100)$ using the currently available data set. We also investigate the possibility and necessary statistics of measuring the $D\pi$ isospin 1/2 scattering length with an accuracy sufficient to distinguish between the predictions from both UChPT and lattice QCD and the measurement by ALICE using femtoscopy.

Title:
New constraints on $Z^\prime$ from captured dark matter annihilation in astrophysical objects

Considering dark matter capture in astrophysical objects such as neutron stars and brown dwarfs, followed by their annihilation into two neutrino and four neutrino final states, we derive new constraints on the mass and coupling of a novel abelian gauge boson $Z^\prime$ arising from an anomaly-free $U(1)$ extension of the Standard Model. We further confront these astrophysical limits with complementary bounds from the Planck-observed relic abundance via the freeze-in mechanism, big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), gravitational wave signatures from cosmic strings, and searches at energy and intensity frontier experiments.

Inclusive and differential cross sections for Higgs boson production in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13.6 TeV are measured using data collected with the CMS detector at the LHC in 2022, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 34.7 fb$^{-1}$. Events with the diphoton final state are selected, and the measured inclusive fiducial cross section is $\sigma_\text{fid}$ = 74 $\pm$ 11 (stat) $^{+5}_{-4}$ (syst) fb, in agreement with the standard model prediction of 67.8 $\pm$ 3.8 fb. Differential cross sections are measured as functions of several observables: the Higgs boson transverse momentum and rapidity, the number of associated jets, and the transverse momentum of the leading jet in the event. Within the uncertainties, the differential cross sections agree with the standard model predictions.

Efficient and accurate particle tracking is crucial for measuring Standard Model parameters and searching for new physics. This task consists of two major computational steps: track finding, the identification of a subset of all hits that are due to a single particle; and track fitting, the extraction of crucial parameters such as direction and momenta. Novel solutions to track finding via machine learning have recently been developed. However, track fitting, which traditionally requires searching for the best global solutions across a parameter volume plagued with local minima, has received comparatively little attention. Here, we propose a novel machine learning solution to track fitting. The per-track optimization task of traditional fitting is transformed into a single learning task optimized in advance to provide constant-time track fitting via direct parameter regression. This approach allows us to optimize directly for the true targets, i.e., the precise and unbiased estimates of the track parameters. This is in contrast to traditional fitting, which optimizes a proxy based on the distance between the track and the hits. In addition, our approach removes the requirement of making simplifying assumptions about the nature of the noise model. Most crucially, in the simulated setting described here, it provides more precise parameter estimates at a computational cost over 1,000 times smaller, which leads directly to improvements in particle momentum estimation, vertex finding, jet substructure, and anomaly detection.

Study on the Impact of Radioactive Background on the Dark Count Rate of 20-inch MCP-PMTs

This study systematically investigates the impact of natural radioactive background on the dark count rate (DCR) of 20-inch microchannel plate photomultiplier tubes (MCP-PMTs). Variations in PMT DCR under different radiation conditions were examined via underground tests, lead shielding experiments, and irradiation with \(^{55}\mathrm{Fe}\), \(^{60}\mathrm{Co}\), and \(^{90}\mathrm{Sr}\) sources. The experimental results indicate that natural radioactivity from surrounding air and rock in the underground environment results in a significantly higher DCR compared to laboratory conditions. Further, lead shielding experiments confirmed that effective shielding can markedly reduce the interference from environmental background radiation. Notably, $\beta$ particles from the \(^{90}\mathrm{Sr}\) source increased the DCR by approximately 14 kHz, whereas the effects of $\mathrm{X}$-rays from \(^{55}\mathrm{Fe}\) and $\gamma$-rays from \(^{60}\mathrm{Co}\) were comparatively minor. In addition, Geant4 simulations provided quantitative analysis of Cherenkov radiation induced by $\beta$ particles, with the simulation results closely matching the experimental data and confirming $\beta$ particles as the primary contributor to the DCR increase. These findings offer both theoretical and experimental evidence for a deeper understanding of the influence of radioactive background on 20-inch MCP-PMTs' performance in underground experiments and hold significant implications for improving the energy resolution of large-scale neutrino detection systems

Recent high-precision $e^+e^-\to c\bar{c}$ data from the BESIII and Belle are highly useful to understand vector charmonium ($\psi$) pole structures and puzzling lineshapes due to the exotic hadron candidates $Y$. We thus perform a global coupled-channel analysis of most of the available data (10 two-body, 9 three-body, and 1 four-body final states) in $\sqrt{s}=3.75-4.7$ GeV. Not only cross sections but also invariant-mass distributions of subsystems are fitted. The $e^+e^-\to \mu^+\mu^-$ cross sections are also predicted. Our model includes dozens of (quasi) two-body states that nonperturbatively couple with each other through bare $\psi$ excitations, particle-exchange, and short-range mechanisms; approximate three-body unitarity is considered. The amplitudes obtained from the fit are analytically continued to $\psi$ and $Z_c$ poles. We find $\psi$ states similar to those in the Particle Data Group listing and $Y(4320)$. Moreover, several $\psi$ states, including new ones, are found close to open charm thresholds. Trajectories and compositeness of the near-threshold poles suggest dominant hadron-molecule contents in their internal structures. Two $Z_c$ poles are found as virtual states $\sim$40 MeV below the $D^*\bar{D}^{(*)}$ thresholds, being consistent with lattice QCD results. This work presents the first global analysis to determine $\psi$ and $Z_c$ poles, thereby paving the way to extracting detailed properties of the prominent exotic hadron candidates from data.

We consider the most general form of soft and collinear factorization for hard-scattering amplitudes to all orders in perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics. Specifically, we present the generalization of collinear factorization to configurations with several collinear directions, where the most singular behaviour is encoded by generalized collinear splitting amplitudes that manifestly embed the breaking of strict collinear factorization in space-like collinear configurations. We also extend the analysis to the simultaneous soft-collinear factorization with multiple collinear directions where na\"ıve multiplicative factorization does not hold. As an illustrative example of factorization breaking, we present explicit results at the one-loop level in the soft-collinear limit.

We report the first analytic calculation of the Higgs boson decay width to gluons up to next-to-leading order in quantum chromodynamics including full dependence on the bottom and charm quark masses. The interference between top- and bottom/charm-quark-induced amplitudes provides unexpectedly large contributions because the large logarithms of the bottom (charm) quark masses over the Higgs boson mass compensate for the suppression of the Yukawa coupling. These logarithms exhibit a unique structure distinct from Sudakov resummation and more complex than the Higgs-gluon-gluon form factor. Our results demonstrate that the previous calculation with massless bottom and charm quarks overestimates the decay width by nearly 20%. The prediction of the partial decay width with massive quarks provides essential theory input needed in the precise determination of Higgs couplings at future colliders.

This report, summarising work achieved in the context of the LHC Dark Matter Working Group, investigates the phenomenology of $t$-channel dark matter models, spanning minimal setups with a single dark matter candidate and mediator to more complex constructions closer to UV-complete models. For each considered class of models, we examine collider, cosmological and astrophysical implications. In addition, we explore scenarios with either promptly decaying or long-lived particles, as well as featuring diverse dark matter production mechanisms in the early universe. By providing a unified analysis framework, numerical tools and guidelines, this work aims to support future experimental and theoretical efforts in exploring $t$-channel dark matter models at colliders and in cosmology.

We describe a resonant cavity search apparatus for axion dark matter constructed by the Quantum Sensors for the Hidden Sector (QSHS) collaboration. The apparatus is configured to search for QCD axion dark matter, though also has the capability to detect axion-like particles (ALPs), dark photons, and some other forms of wave-like dark matter. Initially, a tuneable cylindrical oxygen-free copper cavity is read out using a low noise microwave amplifier feeding a heterodyne receiver. The cavity is housed in a dilution refrigerator and threaded by a solenoidal magnetic field, nominally 8T. The apparatus also houses a magnetic field shield for housing superconducting electronics, and several other fixed-frequency resonators for use in testing and commissioning various prototype quantum electronic devices sensitive at a range of axion masses in the range 2.0 to 40 micro-eV/c2. The apparatus as currently configured is intended as a test stand for electronics over the relatively wide frequency band attainable with the TM010 cavity mode used for axion searches. We present performance data for the resonator, dilution refrigerator, and magnet, and plans for the first science run.

Primordial black holes and magnetic fields in conformal neutrino mass models

Sufficiently strong and long-lasting first-order phase transitions can produce primordial black holes (PBHs) that contribute substantially to the dark matter abundance of the Universe, and can produce large-scale primordial magnetic fields. We study these mechanisms in a generic class of conformal $\mathrm{U(1)}^\prime$ models that also explain active neutrino oscillation data via the type-I seesaw mechanism. We find that phase transitions that occur at seesaw scales between $10^4$ GeV and $10^{11}$ GeV produce gravitational wave signals (from the dynamics of the phase transition and from the decay of cosmic string loops) at LISA/ET that can be correlated with microlensing signals of PBHs at the Roman Space Telescope, while scales near $10^{11}$ GeV can be correlated with Hawking evaporation signals at future gamma-ray telescopes. LISA can probe the entire range of PBH masses between $1\times 10^{-16}M_\odot$ and $8\times 10^{-11}M_\odot$ if PBHs fully account for the dark matter abundance. For Z' masses between 40 TeV and $10^4$ TeV, and 10 TeV right-handed neutrinos, helical magnetic fields can be produced with magnitudes $\gtrsim 0.5$ pG and coherence lengths $\gtrsim 0.008$ Mpc, above current blazar lower bounds.

Charmed baryon decays: $SU(3)_F$ breaking and CP violation

We present a comprehensive study of anti-triplet charmed baryon decays into octet baryons and pseudoscalar mesons using the $SU(3)_F$ flavor symmetry framework. By decomposing the flavor structure, all decay amplitudes are parametrized with a minimal set of irreducible amplitudes, and the Körner-Pati-Woo theorem further reduces the number of independent parameters from the original 35 to 19 under exact symmetry when small terms proportional to $\lambda_b = V_{cb}^*V_{ub}$ are neglected. The independent number becomes 27 with leading $SU(3)_F$ breaking effects. A global fit to 51 experimental measurements yields a $\chi^2$/d.o.f. of 2.36 and provides precise values for the decay amplitudes. Notable discrepancies are observed in the fitted branching fractions of $\Xi_c^0 \to \Xi^- \pi^+$ and $\Xi_c^+ \to \Xi^- \pi^+ \pi^+$, which exceed current measurements by more than $2\sigma$. Incorporating final-state rescattering effects to recover the main effects of terms proportional to $\lambda_b$, we predict enhanced CP violation, with $A_{CP}$ reaching up to $10^{-3}$ in golden channels such as $\Xi_c^0 \to p K^-$ and $\Xi_c^0 \to \Sigma^+ \pi^-$. Our analysis also finds that the branching ratio for $\Xi_c^+ \to \Lambda \pi^+$ is enhanced to $(9.7 \pm 1.2) \times 10^{-4}$ due to significant cancellations.

Charged current neutrino and antineutrino induced associated particle production from nucleons

In this work, we study the charged-current (anti)neutrino-induced associated particle($K\Lambda$) production($\Delta S=0$) from free nucleons in the energy region of a few GeV, relevant to the (anti)neutrino oscillation experiments with accelerator and atmospheric neutrinos. We employ a model based on effective Lagrangians to evaluate the contributions from the nonresonant and the resonant diagrams. The nonresonant background terms are calculated using a microscopic model derived from the SU(3) chiral Lagrangians. For the resonant contributions, we consider the low-lying spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ resonances, such as $S_{11}(1650)$, $P_{11}(1710)$, $P_{11}(1880)$, and $S_{11}(1895)$, and spin-$\frac{3}{2}$ resonances, such as $P_{13}(1720)$ and $P_{13}(1900)$, which have finite branching ratios to the $K\Lambda$ channel. These resonant contributions are modelled using an effective phenomenological Lagrangian approach, with strong couplings determined from the experimental branching ratios and the decay widths to the $K\Lambda$ channel. To fix the parameters of the vector current interaction, the model is first used to reproduce satisfactorily the MAMI experimental data on the real photon induced scattering off the nucleon resulting an eta meson in the final state and with the CLAS data for the $K\Lambda$ production in the final state. The PCAC hypothesis and the generalized Goldberger-Treiman relation are used to fix the parameters of the axial vector interaction. The model is then applied to study the weak production of $K\Lambda$ induced by the neutrinos and antineutrinos, and predicts the numerical values for the $Q^2$-distribution, the kaon kinetic energy distribution, and the total scattering cross sections with and without a cut on the CM energy W. The results presented in this work are relevant for the present and future accelerator and atmospheric neutrino experiments.

SuperKEKB has achieved significantly higher specific luminosity than its predecessor KEKB, and it has proven a much more sustainable machine. It has successfully demonstrated several key design elements of FCC-ee. The design luminosity has not yet been reached, however. This observation is often (mistakenly) used to put into question the reliability of the FCC-ee design luminosity. In this note we review the accomplishments, challenges and obstacles of SuperKEKB, and compare these with the FCC-ee design.
