Title:
Accurate ground states of $SU(2)$ lattice gauge theory in 2+1D and 3+1D

We present a neural network wavefunction framework for solving non-Abelian lattice gauge theories in a continuous group representation. Using a combination of $SU(2)$ equivariant neural networks alongside an $SU(2)$ invariant, physics-inspired ansatz, we learn a parameterization of the ground state wavefunction of $SU(2)$ lattice gauge theory in 2+1 and 3+1 dimensions. Our method, performed in the Hamiltonian formulation, has a straightforward generalization to $SU(N)$. We benchmark our approach against a solely invariant ansatz by computing the ground state energy, demonstrating the need for bespoke gauge equivariant transformations. We evaluate the Creutz ratio and average Wilson loop, and obtain results in strong agreement with perturbative expansions. Our method opens up an avenue for studying lattice gauge theories beyond one dimension, with efficient scaling to larger systems, and in a way that avoids both the sign problem and any discretization of the gauge group.

Title:
Configurational Temperature as a Diagnostic for Complex Langevin Dynamics in the 3D XY Model
Anosh Joseph, Arpith Kumar
Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Lattice (hep-lat); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
We investigate the applicability of complex Langevin dynamics to the three-dimensional XY model at finite chemical potential. To assess correctness, we introduce a new diagnostic based on the configurational temperature (or configurational coupling) estimator, recently proposed as a thermodynamic consistency check. We compare this criterion with the established Nagata-Nishimura-Shimasaki drift-decay test across a range of couplings and chemical potentials. Our results show that complex Langevin dynamics yields reliable results in the ordered phase (large $\beta$), but fails in the disordered phase (small $\beta$), even when the sign problem is mild. The configurational estimator provides a clear and physics-driven reliability test that complements drift-based diagnostics. These findings establish the estimator as a practical tool for identifying incorrect convergence, and highlight its potential for broader applications in lattice field theories with complex actions.

Title:
Smallness of neutrino masses and leptogenesis in 331 composite Higgs model

We consider 331 composite Higgs model (CHM3) in which the Lagrangian of the strongly coupled sector is invariant with respect to global SU(3)_C \times SU(3)\times U(1)_6 symmetry that can originate from SU(6) subgroup of E_6 and contains the gauge group of the standard model (SM) as a subgroup. The breakdown of the approximate SU(3)\times U(1)_6 symmetry down to SU(2)_W\times U(1)_Y subgroup around the scale f\sim 10 TeV results in a set of pseudo--Nambu--Goldstone bosons (pNGBs) that, in particular, involves Higgs doublet. The generation of the masses of the SM fermions in the CHM3 is discussed. We argue that an approximate discrete Z_2 symmetry may give rise to tiny masses of the left-handed neutrinos and several composite fermions with masses 1-2 TeV. The lepton and baryon asymmetries can be generated within the CHM3 via the out--of equilibrium decays of extra Majorana particle into the Higgs doublet and these composite fermions.

Title:
Localized Chiral Magnetic Effect in equilibrium QCD

We study the impact of a non-uniform magnetic background field on the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) in equilibrium QCD using lattice simulations with 2+1 flavors of dynamical staggered quarks at the physical point. We show that in the presence of a non-uniform magnetic field the CME manifests itself via a localized electromagnetic current density along the direction of the field, which integrates to zero over the full volume. Our primary observable is the leading-order coefficient of the current in a chiral chemical potential expansion, which we compute for various lattice spacings and extrapolate to the continuum limit. Our findings demonstrate that, even though the global spatial average of the CME conductivity vanishes in equilibrium, steady currents still exist locally. Thus, spatially modulated magnetic fields provide a possible way of generating a non-trivial CME signal in equilibrium.

We present the results of a first-principles theoretical study of the inclusive semileptonic decays of the $D_s$ meson. We performed a state-of-the-art lattice QCD calculation using the gauge ensembles produced by the Extended Twisted Mass Collaboration (ETMC) with dynamical light, strange and charm quarks with physical masses and employed the so-called Hansen-Lupo-Tantalo (HLT) method to extract the decay rate and the first two lepton-energy moments from the relevant Euclidean correlators. We have carefully taken into account all sources of systematic errors, including the ones associated with the continuum and infinite-volume extrapolations and with the HLT spectral reconstruction method. We obtained results in very good agreement with the currently available experimental determinations and with a total accuracy at the few-percent level, of the same order of magnitude of the experimental error. Our total error is dominated by the lattice QCD simulations statistical uncertainties and is certainly improvable. From the results presented and thoroughly discussed in this paper we conclude that it is nowadays possible to study heavy mesons inclusive semileptonic decays on the lattice at a phenomenologically relevant level of accuracy. The phenomenological implications of our physical results are the subject of a companion letter [1].

We present the results of a first-principles theoretical study of the inclusive semileptonic decays of the $D_{s}$ meson. We performed a state-of-the-art lattice QCD calculation by taking into account all sources of systematic errors. A detailed discussion of our lattice calculation, demonstrating that inclusive semileptonic decays can nowadays be studied on the lattice at a phenomenologically relevant level of accuracy, is the subject of a companion paper [1]. Here we focus on the phenomenological implications of our results. Using the current best estimates of the relevant Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix elements, our theoretical predictions for the decay rate and for the first two lepton-energy moments are in very good agreement with the corresponding experimental measurements. We also argue that, while the inclusive $D_{s}$ channel is not yet competitive with the exclusive channels in the $|V_{cs}|$ determination, the situation can be significantly improved in the near future.

The nature of confinement is connected with color charge. Unfortunately, the color charge densities in QCD, the Noether charge densities associated with the global color invariance, are not invariant under local color rotations. This implies that the expectation values of the net color charge in any region of any physical state in QCD, states that satisfy the color Gauss law, are automatically zero for all components of color. In this paper it is shown that the expectation value of the square of the net color charge in a region, a measure of the color charge fluctuations, is necessarily nonzero when evaluated in physical states and the result, while depending on the scheme and scale by which the theory is regulated, is gauge invariant. This holds despite the formal lack of gauge invariance of the operator. Moreover, there is a particular combination of the color charge fluctuations for the vacuum and for a system describable by a non-trivial density matrix that is independent that has a well-defined continuum limit

Novel insight into centre-vortex geometry in four dimensions

Centre-vortex surfaces are mapped out in four dimensions within the framework of SU(3) lattice gauge theory to understand the role of secondary loops that develop in three-dimensional visualisations of centre-vortex structure, appearing separate from the percolating cluster. Loops that initially appear disconnected in three-dimensional slices can originate from the same connected surface in four dimensions depending on the surface's curvature. For the first time, these secondary loops are identified as "connected" or "disconnected" with respect to the vortex sheet, allowing new insight into the evolution of centre-vortex geometry through the finite-temperature phase transition. At low temperatures, we find that secondary loops of any length primarily lie in the same sheet percolating the four-dimensional volume. Only a handful of small secondary sheets disconnected from the percolating sheet are identified. Above the phase transition, the vortex structure is still found to be dominated by a single large sheet but one that has aligned with the temporal dimension. With the near absence of any curvature orthogonal to the temporal dimension, connected secondary loops become vanishingly rare. Other novel quantities, such as the four-dimensional density of secondary sheets and the sheet sizes themselves, are analysed to build a complete picture of centre-vortex geometry in four dimensions.

Motivated by recent work connecting Higgs phases to symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases, we investigate the interplay of gauge redundancy and global symmetry in lattice gauge theories with Higgs fields in the presence of a boundary. The core conceptual point is that a global symmetry associated to a Higgs field, which is pure-gauge in a closed system, acts physically at the boundary under boundary conditions which allow electric flux to escape the system. We demonstrate in both Abelian and non-Abelian models that this symmetry is spontaneously broken in the Higgs regime, implying the presence of gapless edge modes. Starting with the U(1) Abelian Higgs model in 4D, we demonstrate a boundary phase transition in the 3D XY universality class separating the bulk Higgs and confining regimes. Varying the boundary coupling while preserving the symmetries shifts the location of the boundary phase transition. We then consider non-Abelian gauge theories with fundamental and group-valued Higgs matter, and identify the analogous non-Abelian global symmetry acting on the boundary generated by the total color charge. For SU($N$) gauge theory with fundamental Higgs matter we argue for a boundary phase transition in the O($2N$) universality class, verified numerically for $N=2,3$. For group-valued Higgs matter, the boundary theory is a principal chiral model exhibiting chiral symmetry breaking. We further demonstrate this mechanism in theories with higher-form Higgs fields. We show how the higher-form matter symmetry acts at the boundary and can spontaneously break, exhibiting a boundary confinement-deconfinement transition. We also study the electric-magnetic dual theory, demonstrating a dual magnetic defect condensation transition at the boundary. We discuss some implications and extensions of these findings and what they may imply for the relation between Higgs and SPT phases.

A basis of the gradient flow exact renormalization group for gauge theory

The gradient flow exact renormalization group (GFERG) is a variant of the exact renormalization group (ERG) for gauge theory that is aimed at preserve gauge invariance as manifestly as possible. It achieves this goal by utilizing the Yang--Mills gradient flow or diffusion for the block-spin process. In this paper, we formulate GFERG by the Reuter equation in which the block spinning is done by Gaussian integration. This formulation provides a simple understanding of various points of GFERG, unresolved thus far. First, there exists a unique ordering of functional derivatives in the GFERG equation that remove ambiguity of contact terms. Second, perturbation theory of GFERG suffers from unconventional ultraviolet (UV) divergences if no gauge fixing is introduced. This explains the origin of some UV divergences we have encountered in perturbative solutions to GFERG. Third, the modified correlation functions calculated with the Wilson action in GFERG coincide with the correlation functions of diffused or flowed fields calculated with the bare action. This shows the existence of a Wilson action that reproduces precisely the physical quantities computed by the gradient flow formalism (up to contact terms). We obtain a definite ERG interpretation of the gradient flow. The formulation given in this paper provides a basis for further perturbative/nonperturbative computations in GFERG, preserving gauge invariance maximally.

Nucleon mass: trace anomaly and $σ$-terms

We give a pedagogical introduction to the origin of the mass of the nucleon. We first review the trace anomaly of the energy-momentum tensor, which generates most of the nucleon mass via the gluon fields and thus contributes even in the case of vanishing quark masses. We then discuss the contributions to the nucleon mass that do originate from the Higgs mechanism via the quark masses, reviewing the current status of nucleon $\sigma$-terms that encode the corresponding matrix elements.

Chiral and deconfinement transitions in spin-polarized quark matter

We investigate the influence of spin polarization in strongly interacting matter by introducing a finite spin potential, $\mu_\Sigma$, which effectively controls the spin density of the system without requiring rotation or specific boundary conditions. Inspired by recent lattice QCD simulations that incorporated such a potential, we implement this approach within an effective QCD framework. Our results show that increasing spin polarization leads to a simultaneous decrease in both the chiral and deconfinement restoration temperatures. The resulting phase structure is qualitatively consistent with lattice findings, and notably, we observe the emergence of a first-order chiral phase transition at low temperature. These results suggest that spin-polarized environments can significantly impact the QCD phase diagram and offer a controlled route for studying spin effects in hot and dense matter.

Axial-vector molecular structures $B_{c}^{\ast \pm} B_{c}^{\mp}$

The axial-vector molecular structure $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{AV}}=(B_{c}^{\ast +}B_{c}^{-} + B_{c}^{\ast - } B_{c}^{+})/2$ is explored in QCD sum rule framework. The mass and current coupling of this compound are found by means of the two-point sum rule method. It turns out that the mass of $\mathcal{M} _{\mathrm{AV}}$ is equal to $m=(12770 \pm 60)~\mathrm{MeV}$ making possible its dissociations to pairs of $J/\psi \eta_b$, $\Upsilon \eta_c$, $ B_{c}^{\ast +} B_{c}^{-}$, and $B_{c}^{\ast - } B_{c}^{+}$ mesons. The partial widths of these decay modes contain the strong couplings at $ \mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{AV}}$-meson-meson vertices which are calculated by utilizing the three-point sum rule method. The full decay width of the molecule $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{AV}}$ is formed due to these dominant processes and amounts to $\Gamma[\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{AV}}]=(93 \pm 14)~ \mathrm{MeV}$. Our results for parameters $m$ and $\Gamma[\mathcal{M}_{ \mathrm{AV}}]$ of the hadronic molecule $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{AV}}$ are useful for experimental studies of various fully heavy four-quark mesons.
