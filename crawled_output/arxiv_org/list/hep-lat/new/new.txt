Title:

The masses of pure gauge glueballs are calculated with the use of relativistic string Hamiltonian without fitting parameters. The string tension $\sigma_f=0.184$~GeV$^2$ in fundamental representation is fixed, using the Necco-Sommer lattice data, and to calculate the vector coupling $\alpha_{\rm V}(r)$ the value of $\Lambda_{\overline{MS}}^0=238$~MeV ($N_f=0$) is taken. The spin-spin potential, defined via the vacuum correlation function, is shown to produce a screening effect and decrease a hyperfine splittings between tensor and scalar glueballs. The masses of first and second $0^{++}$, $2^{++}$ excitations are predicted. For the ground states the masses $M(0^{++})=1508$~MeV, $M(2^{++})=2292$~MeV (in case A), in agreement with those of $f_0(1500),~f_2(2300)$ are obtained, and the first excitation mass $M(0^{++})=2613$~MeV is predicted. In case B $M(0^{++})=1.669$~MeV, $M(2^{++})=2212$~MeV are obtained.

Title:
Dilated coordinate method for solving nuclear lattice effective field theory

We introduce a dilated coordinate method to address computational challenges in nuclear lattice effective field theory (NLEFT) for weakly-bound few-body systems. The approach employs adaptive mesh refinement via analytic coordinate transformations, dynamically adjusting spatial resolution to resolve short-range nuclear interactions with fine grids while efficiently capturing long-range wave function tails with coarse grids. Numerical demonstrations for two- and three-body systems confirm accelerated convergence towards infinite-volume limit compared to uniform lattices, particularly beneficial for accessing highly excited states and shallow bound states near the continuum threshold. This method establishes a foundation for \textit{ab initio} studies of exotic nuclear systems near the dripline and light hypernuclei, with direct extensions to scattering and reaction processes.

Title:

Quantum simulation offers a powerful approach to studying quantum field theories, particularly (2+1)D quantum electrodynamics (QED$_3$), which hosts a rich landscape of physical phenomena. A key challenge in lattice formulations is the proper realization of topological phases and the Chern-Simons terms, where fermion discretization plays a crucial role. In this work, we analyze staggered and Wilson fermions coupled to $\text{U}(1)$ background gauge fields in the Hamiltonian formulation and demonstrate that staggered fermions fail to induce (2+1)D topological phases, while Wilson fermions admit a variety of topological phases including Chern insulator and quantum spin Hall phases. We additionally uncover a rich phase diagram for the two-flavor Wilson fermion model in the presence of a chemical potential. Our findings resolve existing ambiguities in Hamiltonian formulations and provide a theoretical foundation for future quantum simulations of gauge theories with topological phases. We further outline connections to experimental platforms, offering guidance for implementations on near-term quantum computing architectures.

Title:
Stability of universal properties against perturbations of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm
Matteo Bacci, Claudio Bonati
Comments:

We numerically investigate the stability of universal properties at continuous phase transitions against perturbations of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm used to simulate the system. We consider the three dimensional XY model as test bed, and both local (single site Metropolis) and global (single cluster) updates, introducing deterministic truncation-like perturbations and stochastic perturbations in the acceptance probabilities. In (almost) all the cases we find a remarkable stability of the universal properties, even against large perturbations of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm, with critical exponents and scaling curves consistent with those of the standard XY model within statistical uncertainties. Only for the single cluster update with very large truncation error does something different happen, but large scaling corrections prevent us from precisely assessing the critical properties of the transition, and, in particular, to understand whether the critical behavior observed corresponds to a known universality class.
