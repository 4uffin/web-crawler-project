Offices with a Geographic Focus
EPA offices with a geographic focus enable EPA to address health and environmental concerns in a specific area of the country across a set of environmental, economic, cultural, and other conditions common in that area. Focusing on a specific area also enhances opportunities to work with other federal, state, local and tribal partners, as well as with citizen groups, and others.
