EPA's Implementation of the Privacy Act
Privacy at EPA
The Privacy Act of 1974  (5 U.S.C. § 552a) mandates how federal agencies maintain records about individuals. The law strives to balance the government's need to maintain these records with the individual's right to be protected from unwarranted invasions of personal privacy.
