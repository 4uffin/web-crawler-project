South River, N.J. - U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced it has stopped harmful chemicals from getting into the South River in Middlesex County, New Jersey and put a local facility on the road to complying with environmental regulations. In July 2025, EPA collaborated with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection to respond to a public concern about chemical odors and a white, foaming substance along the South River. EPA inspected the facility, Envirochem, Inc., suspected of producing the discharge and issued an order under the Clean Water Act (CWA) to stop the discharge.  “Risks to America’s waterways call for fast action and EPA is ready to step in,” said EPA Regional Administrator Michael Martucci. “This shows how listening to the public and working with the state and local partners can help identify pollution sources, prevent pollution, and deliver clean water to communities throughout the region.”  Within two weeks of receiving the complaint from the public, EPA inspected Envirochem, Inc. While evaluating the facility, EPA inspectors observed improper drainage systems on site that allowed a foaming liquid to flow from a chemical loading dock directly into the South River. EPA issued the administrative order which requires the facility to stop the discharge of unauthorized pollutants immediately, as well as to develop measures to comply with the requirements of the CWA. As a result, the chemical discharge was stopped and Envirochem, Inc. is currently working on longer-term solutions to properly manage its operations and prevent direct discharges into the river. Through training, technical guidance, and case-by-case problem solving, EPA works with communities to fulfill its core mission of protecting human health and the environment while simultaneously helping businesses thrive. Follow EPA Region 2 on X, Instagram, and visit our Facebook page.
