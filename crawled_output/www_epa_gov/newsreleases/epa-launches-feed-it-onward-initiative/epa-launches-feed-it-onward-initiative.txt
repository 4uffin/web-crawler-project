St. Clair County, ILLINOIS — U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin today announced the launch of Feed It Onward, a new national initiative designed to reduce food waste and strengthen food security across America. At Scott Air Force Base in Illinois, Administrator Zeldin was joined by representatives from Frey Farms, who delivered a truckload of fresh produce, that otherwise would’ve been sent to a landfill, to feed and support military families on base. “I want to thank Frey Farms and Scott Air Force Base for being our first partners of EPA’s new Feed It Onward initiative to reduce food waste in the United States,” said Administrator Lee Zeldin. “Feed It Onward highlights how Americans of all walks of life, from our farmers, service members, business owners, and government can join hands and help our fellow Americans. We hope this initiative will help amplify the Americans working each day to help their fellow citizens.” “At Frey Farms, we believe that good food should never go to waste. Partnering with the EPA gives us the opportunity to live out that value in a meaningful way - reducing waste, nourishing families, and honoring the men and women who serve our country,” said Frey Farms CEO Sarah Frey. “I’m especially grateful for Administrator Zeldin’s leadership and vision. Together, I’m confident we can advance solutions that not only protect our environment, but also provide real support for our nation’s military families.” In the United States, more than one-third of all food goes uneaten and gets thrown away. This creates an impact on both our environment and American families’ wallets. Food waste has become the largest component of materials reaching our landfills, more than any other type of trash. At the same time, millions of families across the country don't have enough food to eat. Data from EPA’s 2025 report, Estimating the Cost of Food Waste to Consumers (pdf), shows that individual consumers lose $728 annually to food waste—equivalent to $14 thrown away every single week. A family of four wastes nearly $3,000 worth of food each year, representing approximately 11 percent of their total household spend on food. Programs like Feed It Onward can help the environment and help American families save money by making sure good food doesn’t go to waste. Feed It Onward connects food donors with communities in need while reducing the environmental impact of food waste in landfills. Feed It Onward will continue to partner with private and public entities to highlight food waste and recovery initiatives and connect food providers with opportunities to reduce our nation’s food waste. Background:  Feed It Onward is a voluntary program that partners with farms, restaurants, grocery stores, food brands, and military bases donating food within their communities.  As part of the America 250 celebration, Feed It Onward reflects the values that have always made the country strong — generosity, grit, and community. EPA encourages organizations nationwide to join this vital effort to reduce food waste while strengthening communities. To learn more or become a partner, visit EPA’s Feed It Onward webpage.
