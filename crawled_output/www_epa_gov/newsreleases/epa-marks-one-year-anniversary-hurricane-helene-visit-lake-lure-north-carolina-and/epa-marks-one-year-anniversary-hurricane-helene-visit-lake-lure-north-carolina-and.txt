EPA marks one-year anniversary of Hurricane Helene with visit to Lake Lure, North Carolina, and commitment to remaining a partner in western North Carolina’s recovery Lake Lure, North Carolina (Sept. 17, 2025) – Today, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) officials marked the one-year anniversary of Hurricane Helene with a tour of Lake Lure, a mountain town struck with more than 22 inches of rainfall during the hurricane that caused catastrophic damage.  EPA provided support to state and local agencies for Lake Lure and all impacted areas by helping restore wastewater and drinking water systems and recovering and disposing of hazardous waste. EPA is continuing its support the communities through allocating a total of $685 million to North Carolina for water infrastructure resiliency, as well as $61 million through the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) for Hurricane Helene recovery.  “The devastation in Lake Lure and other parts of western North Carolina was overwhelming, yet through collaboration and the hard work of so many, these communities have made incredible progress,” said EPA Regional Administrator Kevin McOmber. “This work is far from over, and EPA will continue to partner with state and local agencies, ensuring these communities will be more resilient and better able to withstand weather events.”  “Having reliable and resilient drinking water and wastewater systems is critical to both the health and economic prosperity of North Carolinians,” said North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality Secretary Reid Wilson. “The recent funding provided by EPA is instrumental in helping these communities rebuild and recover, and DEQ plans to begin awarding funding to local government water and wastewater systems this week.” Below is some of the work EPA’s accomplished in order to fulfill its core mission of protecting human health and the environment in the aftermath. This is in addition to the allocations for water system resiliency:  Wastewater and Drinking Water Systems EPA worked with state partners and local utilities to bring drinking water and wastewater systems back online, restoring service to more than 75 drinking water systems serving approximately 260,000 people in the Asheville area. EPA mobile water labs analyzed more than 1,500 drinking water samples from private wells in Buncombe and Watauga Counties. EPA offered technical guidance to local water operators, supporting efforts to restore and maintain drinking water systems and other essential services safely. EPA advised residents on precautions to prevent waterborne illnesses, emphasizing the importance of following local boil water advisories and staying informed through local health updates in collaboration with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance and local health authorities. Hazardous Waste  EPA collected more than 1,200 containers with oil, hazardous materials or propane from orphan containers for recycling or disposal. EPA managed approximately 20,000 gallons of oil and oil-contaminated fluids recovered from various containers, tanks, etc.; had it tested for hazardous substances and then arranged for the transportation of the usable material to an oil recycler in Charlotte. Background Hurricane Helene struck western North Carolina on September 27, 2024, causing catastrophic flooding and destruction. A Federal Major Disaster Declaration covered 39 North Carolina counties and the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians.
