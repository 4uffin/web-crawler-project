Syracuse, N.Y. - U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has issued an order under the Safe Drinking Water Act to the City of Syracuse that lays out steps the city needs to take to address lead in its drinking water. This order is the result of an inspection conducted in April in collaboration with the New York State Department of Health, and takes into account information gathered during conversations with the state, city, and groups that have petitioned EPA to consider taking certain actions. The order addresses lead levels in drinking water and strengthens protections for children and families by requiring the city to improve corrosion control to prevent lead from pipes leaching into water, continue proper lead tap sampling at appropriate locations, and establish a robust plan for educating the public on the health risks of lead and how to reduce their exposure.“Families across America, including Syracuse, deserve clean drinking water,” said EPA Regional Administrator Michael Martucci. “EPA is working alongside the City of Syracuse and the New York State Department of Health to address lead risks and put long-term solutions in place. This order provides Syracuse a roadmap that clearly lays out the steps needed under federal regulation to address lead in its drinking water.”“The State Health Department oversaw the most recent round of monitoring and results were below the action level for lead,” said New York State Health Commissioner Dr. James McDonald. “The Department will continue to be actively involved to ensure the public’s health is protected and that the public water system meets all state and federal requirements.”EPA’s inspection report identified errors in the manner and location in which samples were taken and also cited inadequate public education. The order increases EPA oversight and directs Syracuse to develop protocols for improved sampling for EPA approval, continue the increased frequency of tap monitoring until otherwise directed, and complete all required lead education outreach.Background:Lead can enter drinking water when service lines or household plumbing contain lead. Exposure to lead is particularly harmful to children and can affect growth, behavior, and learning. A successful lead sampling program is contingent on public participation and cooperation. To learn more and support ongoing sampling efforts, visit the Syracuse Water Department website.While replacing lead service lines is a years-long process, steps can be taken to reduce the amount of lead leaching from the pipes or fittings via a corrosion control system that forms a barrier between the pipe and the water. EPA established technical assistance contractor centers to help water systems, including to aid in developing effective corrosion control treatment. Syracuse is currently receiving this assistance.  EPA remains committed to helping state and local entities meet environmental standards and protecting human health. Through training, technical guidance, and case-by-case problem solving, EPA works as a partner – not just a regulator – to keep communities safe and businesses thriving across the country.For more information on lead in drinking water, visit EPA's Lead webpage.Follow EPA Region 2 on X, Instagram, and visit our Facebook page.
