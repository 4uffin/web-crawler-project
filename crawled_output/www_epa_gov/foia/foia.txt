EPA Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)
FOIA
The FOIA furthers the EPA's fundamental commitment to government accountability through information transparency and accessibility.
1
The FOIA allows any person access to federal agency records. All agencies, including the EPA, have the duty to release records to the public. To balance the public's right to know with efficient government operations, the FOIA allows agencies to withhold nine categories of information from the public if disclosure of that information would harm government or private interests.
