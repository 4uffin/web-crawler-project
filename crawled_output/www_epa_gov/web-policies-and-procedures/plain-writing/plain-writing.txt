Plain Writing
Clear air... clear water... it all depends on clear writing.
The Plain Writing Act of 2010 (pdf) requires federal agencies to write "clear Government communication that the public can understand and use."
Former President Obama emphasized the importance of establishing "a system of transparency, public participation, and collaboration" in his January 21, 2009, Memorandum on Transparency and Open Government.
The EPA uses the Federal Plain Language Guidelines to write new documents in plain language.
EPA staff oversee our plain writing efforts, and Eric Wachter, director of the Office of the Executive Secretariat, serves as the Senior Agency Official for Plain Writing.
We are training our employees to improve our review process. We must use plain writing in any document that:
is necessary for obtaining any federal government benefit or service or for filing taxes;
provides information about any federal government benefit or service; or
explains to the public how to comply with a requirement that the federal government administers or enforces.
We must report on our progress and success. This site shares the initial report and annual reports on the Plain Writing Act.
We need your help to comply with this Act! Let us know if you have trouble understanding any content on our website, so we can make sure EPA documents comply with the Plain Writing Act.
