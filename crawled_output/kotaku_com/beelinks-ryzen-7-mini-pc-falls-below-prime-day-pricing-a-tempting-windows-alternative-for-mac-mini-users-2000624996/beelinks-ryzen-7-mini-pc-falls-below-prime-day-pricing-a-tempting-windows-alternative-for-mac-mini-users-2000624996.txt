The mini PC wave doesn’t seem to be cresting anytime soon. Far from it, in fact, as more and more new models hit the market â and, like this Windows 11 Pro model from Beelink â hit the Amazon sale list. The Beelink SER5 PRO Mini PC has an AMD Ryzen 7 processor that can reach speeds of up to 4.5GHz, and three-monitor support via HDMI, DisplayPort, and USB-C, all of which can support 4K resolution.
This mini PC has all the connections you need, including Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.2, and during this limited-time Amazon deal, this price is very definitely right â just $265 after a 26% drop from its usual retail price of $360. There’s a whole lot of productivity and computing muscle in this small package that’s now at a smaller price, so read on and decide.

Is This You?
A mini PC is not going to be your hardcore gaming rig or your high-end 3D-editing station. But if you’re looking for a PC that’s reliable, more than fast enough for everyday productivity tasks and streaming, quick for browsing, and positioned in an excellent price point, that’s a pretty solid description of the Beelink SER5 PRO. If you value efficient spatial organization and hate the idea of adding a bulky tower or even a large laptop to your desk, then the SER5 PRO is really for you.
The SER5 PRO is so small that you can easily fit three 4K monitors on your desk. And you’ll be able to run them all at the same time, since the SER5 PRO’s Ryzen 7 5825U 8-core processor, 16GB of RAM (expandable to 64GB), and 2000MHz AMD Radeon Graphics 8 chip provide more than enough graphic-generating muscle. There’s an HDMI 60Hz port, DisplayPort, and USB-C port at the ready for your monitors, along with four USB-A 3.2 Gen2 ports and a 2.5Gbps LAN for super-fast hardwired internet.
Built to Last
The Beelink SER5 PRO is designed to be your everyday PC for a long time to come, and that’s not just because of the sturdy construction bolstered by a silent high-speed fan, heat sink, and other safety features to guard against overheating. It’s also expandable â there are dual SO-DIMM RAM slots so you can easily boost the RAM as high as 64GB, and the 500GB SSD storage can be swapped out for one as large as 4TB.
The mini PCs are only going to keep becoming more common and more advanced, but this Beelink SER5 PRO has the power to be your everyday desktop PC right now, and also the capacity to expand to meet future workloads. The Amazon limited-time deal price of $265 may end up being your PC budget for years to come.
