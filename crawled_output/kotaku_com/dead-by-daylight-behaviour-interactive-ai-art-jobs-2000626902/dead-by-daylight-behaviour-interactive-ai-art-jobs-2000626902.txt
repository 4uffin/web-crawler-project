Today, Dead by Daylight fans noticed that developer Behaviour Interactive is hiring for a Senior Full-stack Programmer at the team’s Montreal and Toronto studios. The person hired would work with the team’s “Generative AI Research Team,” with a directive to work on “researching, developing, and integrating innovative solutions using generative AI.” Fans saw “generative AI” and assumed that this might mean that the online asymmetrical horror game would be filled with generative AI assets in a future update. However, Behaviour has publicly spoken out about these claims, saying that it isn’t the case. In a post on X, Behaviour responded to a post speculating that the hired programmer would be working on Dead by Daylight, clarifying that this position is entirely dedicated to improving the companyâs workflow using AI, rather than creating anything that will show up in the game itself. âWe have a very firm policy that prevents the inclusion of anything generated by AI in Dead by Daylight or any other game we’re working on, including marketing assets,â the post reads. âYes, Behaviour is exploring the use of generative AI tools to improve internal workflows – not for anything that ships in our games. But our policy isn’t changing, and this job isn’t for a role on a game team.â

The actual job listing itself notes this as well, saying âBehaviour is exploring the use of generative AI tools to improve internal workflows – not for anything that ships in our games.â Iâm sure people are relieved to know that genAI slop isnât about to infect Dead by Daylight any time soon. However, some people still take issue with the company using generative AI in any capacity, or argue that this is a slippery slope that could lead to implementing it elsewhere in the company.Â  Dead by Daylight will enter its 37th “Chapter” on September 25, which will introduce The Krasue, a new Killer character with an absolutely gnarly intro animation.
