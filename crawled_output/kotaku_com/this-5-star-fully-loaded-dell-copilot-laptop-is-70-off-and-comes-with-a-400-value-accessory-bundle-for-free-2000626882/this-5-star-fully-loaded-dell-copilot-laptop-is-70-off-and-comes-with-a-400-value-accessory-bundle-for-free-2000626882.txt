When’s the last time you flexed on somebody about a laptop deal? We’re guessing â maybe even hoping â the answer is “never,” but if you’re so inclined, this Amazon limited-time deal on a fully tricked-out Dell Inspiron 15 touchscreen is a golden opportunity, because it’s being sold at a savings of over $2,000. The bottom-line $900 price is a 70% drop from the list price of $2,999.
When we say “fully tricked out,” we’re being quite literal. It’s stuffed with max memory (64GB), max storage (2TB), and Microsoft’s best OS (Windows 11 Pro), which includes the elite-level Copilot AI assistant. Pretty much every bell and every whistle is included here, with a $400 accessories bundle thrown in for good measure.

Not a Retread
If you’re looking for the “used” or “refurbished” or “dent and scratch special” tag on this Dell Inspiron 15, you’re not going to find one. It’s a brand-new 2024 model that’s fully up to date in every way possible. It’s notÂ the lightest laptop around, but at just 3.66 pounds, it’s hardly a lumbering dinosaur. And the Intel Core i5 processor is competitive, with speeds up to 4.66GHz.
This Dell Inspiron 15 touchscreen laptop is an obvious productivity superstar, with that processor and memory and storage combining with Realtek Wi-Fi 6 to power through remote work and as many work tasks as you can throw at it. Copilot AI will work wonders here as well when you need a hand with an Excel spreadsheet or you’re just not finding the right words for your email to the boss. It also has a 720p HD camera with a built-in privacy shutter, and MaxxAudio Pro stereo speakers for your Zoom calls and video conferencing.
Time to Play
All that speed and power and those hot speakers can also make this Dell Inspiron 15 a great gaming and streaming laptop when you’re off hours. The 15.6-inch display is full HD, with 1.4 million pixels and anti-glare coating to bring your games and shows to life, and if you cap off your work day with a long gaming grind or binge-watching your favorite new streaming show, the battery is up to the task, and Dell’s ExpressCharge tech lets you power it all the way back up to 80% in just 60 minutes.
Nobody will question your deal-scoring bona fides when you tell them the insane deal you got on this Dell Inspiron 15 touchscreen laptop. But you’ll want to tell them anyway: This $900 deal is a 70% drop from the original price of $2,999, and that’s not including the $400 accessory bundle that you’re getting for free.
