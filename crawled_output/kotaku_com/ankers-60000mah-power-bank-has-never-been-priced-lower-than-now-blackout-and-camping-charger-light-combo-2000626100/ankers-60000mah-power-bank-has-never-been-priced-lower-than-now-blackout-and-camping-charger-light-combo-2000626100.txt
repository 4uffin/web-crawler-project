When one device can address several inconveniences and annoyances while putting a pile of money back in your pocket, it’s well worth a look. The Anker 548 Power Bank 60,000mAh portable power station cost $250 two years ago, but right now at Amazon it’s only $80 â its lowest price ever, and a 47% reduction from its most recent retail price of $150. It’ll be the best $80 you’ve spent in a long while after just one camping trip or one blackout.
What are those annoyances it can eliminate for you? How about when the power goes out and you reach into the junk drawer for a flashlight, only to discover it’s dead and has likely been dead for a long time, leaving you to scramble for a handful of D-cell batteries. Or when you buy a “portable” power station only to discover it might be portable if you’re a powerlifter, but otherwise it’s a ginormous device that you’d really rather not have to carry around. The Anker 548 Power Bank is the $80 solution to those woes, and many more.

Truly, Amazingly Portable
Unless you enjoy the workout of lugging a “portable” power station that tips the scales at 25 or more pounds, the first thing you’ll notice about the Anker 548 Power Bank is that it’s really, truly portable for everyone. It’s barely over 5 pounds, and has a built-in handle atop its compact 4.6 x 4.6 x 8.2 inch body. It’s power on the go literally anywhere you need it â ideal for stashing in your bedroom for a power outage, keeping in the car for powering devices on long trips, or occupying a very small space in your vehicle on your next outdoor adventure.
The built-in light at the top of the Anker 548 Power Bank is retractable so it can give you either a little glow or a full-on light source, and there’s also an SOS mode for emergencies â ideal for roadside breakdowns. The Anker 548 is also ready when you need it, even if that’s months away â after a full year without being recharged, it retains an amazing 85% of its charge.
Multi-Device Power
The Anker 548 Power Bank has an enormous 60,000mAh capacity, and two USB-C and two USB-A ports ready for your devices. That’s enough to fully charge a MacBook Air almost 3 times, and an iPhone 14 Pro Max 7.4 times, and a 3W LED emergency lamp will stay lit for over 42 hours. The LED Smart Display shows you all the vital stats, including the power level of the 548 Power Bank itself. Recharging the Anker 548 Power Bank is a simple USB-C operation, or you can attach it to a compatible solar panel with an XT-60 connector for clean, endlessly renewable recharging.
It’s safe to say the Anker 548 Power Bank massively overperforms the $80 price tag it’s carrying during this limited-time Amazon deal. It’ll take just one power outage or one fun camping trek for it to easily pay for itself, and since it has a projected lifespan up to 10 times longer than most competing models, you’ll have plenty of time to reap the rewards.
