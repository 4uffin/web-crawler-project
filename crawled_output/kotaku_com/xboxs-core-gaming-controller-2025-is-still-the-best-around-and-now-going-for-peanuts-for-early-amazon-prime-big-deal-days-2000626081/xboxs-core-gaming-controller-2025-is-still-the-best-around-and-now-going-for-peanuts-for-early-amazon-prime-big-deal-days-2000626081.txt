Whether you’re gaming on an Xbox console, PC, or Android device, the first-party Xbox Core controller is still one of if not the very best gamepad out there. Right now, it’s been discounted down from $65 to just $50 for the robot white version. That’s a solid $15 discount. If you want something a bit funkier than that, colorways like the deep pink, shock blue, and pulse red are on sale too in the $50 to $55 range.

While Sony each generation has decided to push forward, adding on new bells and whistles to its DualShock controller design like a touchpad or haptic triggers, Microsoft had different plans. Xbox firmly planted its flag in the dirt back in 2013 with the release of the Xbox One controller and said “We’re done here.” 12 years later, the design is mostly unchanged with some slight adjustments to keep with modern times such as Bluetooth support and a change over to USB-C. Other than that and some slightly upgraded materials, you’re basically looking at the same controller that launched the same year Grand Theft Auto V came out the first time.
Nothing’s really changed within the form factor of the Xbox Core controller because it just works.
Unbeatable Controller Design
I played through Hollow Knight on my PlayStation 5 in the lead up to the release ofÂ Silksong. It’s fine, but I decided to gift myself a new Xbox controller for playing the new one on PC Game Pass. I haven’t updated my Xbox controllers since those first few years of the Xbox One. I’d been mostly using either PlayStation or some third-party stuff like 8BitDo’s selection of retro controllers, but unboxing my brand new Sky Cipher Xbox controller felt like returning home.
An underrated, less talked about, standout of the Xbox controller is its D-pad. Dashing and hopping around with Hornet through Pharloom with that just sings. Feels comfortable to grip onto for long game sessions.Â The textured grips on the triggers, bumpers and back-case are a nice touch which are very welcomed when my hands are dripping with sweat as I go up against the Splinter Sister for an eighth time.
Some new improvements that have actually come in this last decade is a whole suite of customization options. You can map out button layouts to your own personal preference with the Xbox Accessories app. Anything that adds accessibility for folks who need it is a win in my book, even if the person using it is just someone who grew up on Nintendo that keeps forgetting which one is the A button.
