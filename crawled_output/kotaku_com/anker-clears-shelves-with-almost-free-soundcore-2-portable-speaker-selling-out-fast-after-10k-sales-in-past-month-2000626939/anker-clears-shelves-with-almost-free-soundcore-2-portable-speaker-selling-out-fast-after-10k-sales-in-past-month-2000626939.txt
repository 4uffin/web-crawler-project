I was late to the party in discovering what a treat the new Sony-animated, Netflix-owned hit movieÂ K-Pop Demon HuntersÂ is. The story and characters are fun, but we all know the real show is the soundtrack. Just banger after banger. You should be listening to “Golden” and “Your Idol” on loop and you deserve to do that on a good speaker. Anker has its Soundcore 2 Bluetooth speaker on sale right now over at Amazon. Normally priced at $45, you can get one for as low as $29. That 35% discount saves you a solid $16.
That cheaper price is for the black model. If you’re willing to pay a wee bit more (but still less than the list price) you can grab the Anker Soundcore 2 speaker in one of three funky colors. It’s available in red, blue, and navy. Each of those is discounted down from $46 to $38. That $9 difference between these and the black version might be worth it if you want some extra style in your life.

What we have here is a fine portable speaker with big sound in a compact form. At only about 6.5 inches long, The Anker Soundcore 2 can easily slip into a bag or be carried around with your wherever you go. It utilizes Bluetooth 5.0 which can ensure you always maintain a stable connection between your phone, laptop, or other audio source and the speaker., even at a distance.
The speaker has a powerful battery with 5,200mAh, capable of delivering you great sound all day long. That Li-ion battery will last you a full 24 hours on a single charge.
Rugged for the Outdoors
Don’t be afraid to take this Bluetooth speaker outside. The Anker Soundcore 2 is IPX7 waterproof so it can handle getting splashed on poolside under rained over. It can even be fully submerged underwater and come out just fine. Heck, take this in the shower with you and sing along.
If you decide to double dip and get yourself a second Anker Soundcore 2 speaker, you can wireless pair them together. This will enable a bold stereo sound for even more immersive listening at double the volume. You can even choose to just have them both output the same thing if you want to keep them in different rooms of your house during a party. This way as people navigate from the living room the to kitchen, they never need to leave the music behind.
Right now, you can get this Anker Soundcore 2 Bluetooth speaker for as low as just $29.
