These two sides met earlier this year in the Women's Six Nations. France began their campaign with a 27-15 win over Ireland in Belfast despite a 20-minute red card for Gabrielle Vernier.The centre opened the scoring with the game's first try but had her 45th-minute yellow card for a high tackle upgraded by the Television Match Official (TMO) bunker.Scott Bemand's side drew within two points in the closing stages at Kingspan Stadium but, in a game in which both teams scored three tries, France grabbed the contest's final 10 points thanks to Emilie Boulard's late score and five points from the tee for MorÂ­gane Bourgeois.The French full-back kicked 12 points in total with those efforts proving to be the difference in a game where number eight Aoife Wafer crossed twice for Ireland.Image source, Getty Images

Watch out for Aoife Wafer today, she picks out lines, she is able to beat defenders, and she brings a lot of energy. I used to love playing in weather like this, it is a forwards day!

Ireland will play their first stand-alone Women's Six Nations fixture at the Aviva Stadium when they host Scotland at the Dublin venue next year.Scott Bemand's side will face Scotland in their final 2026 Six Nations fixture on Sunday, 17 May, with kick-off at 14:30 BST.It will be the second time Ireland, who face France in the Women's World Cup last eight on Sunday, have played at Aviva Stadium.In their first game they cruised to a five-try victory over Italy in 2014 which formed part of a Six Nations double-header alongside the men's team."A lot of work has happened behind the scenes to get to this point from everyone across the IRFU and as part of our women's strategy, we're committed to growing our Green Wave further off the back of the brilliant support the team has received throughout the Women's Rugby World Cup 2025," said IRFU Director of Communications Aoife Clarke."We have seen fantastic numbers turn out in Northampton and Brighton in recent weeks and we want to see them out in force in Aviva Stadium next May."Image source, Inpho

Ireland back row Fiona Tuite says her side "have another gear" to reach in their Women's Rugby World Cup quarter-final against France in Exeter.Scott Bemand's side are playing their first knockout game in this competition since 2014 against a France side who beat them in this year's Women's Six Nations in Belfast.Tuite believes Ireland have been building steadily through the pool stage for this game and they are ready to produce a big performance."I have no doubt we have another gear in us from a physical, speed and tactical point of view to really chase this game on Sunday," she said."We have a next level and a new height to come for us as a squad."Image source, Getty Images

One player Ireland will have to do without is their co-captain Edel McMahon who is out through injury.What Tricky brings is not just her performances on the pitch but her leadership too.She does her job extremely well week in, week out, and you could never say that she hasn't put everything on the line.She's someone who is going to give absolutely everything to get a win and that's the kind of player that you always want in your squad, especially going into a knockout game like this.She is going to be a big loss for Ireland.When you're in that environment and unable to play, it feels like the worst place in the world.It'll be so disappointing for her on a personal level. You want to be involved in every game when you're in that squad, especially so whenever you're leading the team.It just means that her role will have changed throughout this week. She's very detailed and really reads and can analyse the game like no one else throughout the week.She'll probably look more off-field and step up on that side of things.Edel will help prepare them in any way she can.Image source, Getty Images

Image source, InphoThe first 20 minutes of Sunday's quarter-final against France will probably feel like the hardest game Aoife Wafer has ever played.She has not played a game since April and it's a huge ask to come back straight into a World Cup quarter-final and be expected to hit the ground running.But, while it would be tough for any player to come in and start in a game like this after such a long lay-off, I know the type of player she is too.Aoife has proven time and time again and how good she is. I'm sure she'll rise to the challenge ahead of her once again.But it's never all about one player. You'll always have star players who are more prevalent in the media, but you can see how others have stepped up in her absence.Aoife is a bit like Antoine Dupont in that way.He's the star player among other stars within that French squad and they all go about their daily jobs and perform to high levels.What Aoife will bring is probably big game moments - turnovers and carries - and others will get energy off things like that, but we've seen already how many other good players there are in Scott Bemand's squad.

This is Ireland's first knockout game at a World Cup since 2014, the biggest game of their lives for these players.There's this fine line. You want to be tapping into that emotion and it being such a huge achievement for this team, but then also not letting it override your every thought and building it up into something that you're almost afraid to be doing when the day comes around.When I was in camp, I used to need to get out for a coffee, or even just watch a terrible TV show in the hotel, because when you're in the midst of a tournament, rugby can become every waking moment of your day.And the closer kick-off gets, the bigger the occasion can seem.There'll be a lot of Irish fans over again and there's a great atmosphere at a sold-out Sandy Park. It is quite an exposed stadium though, and one that the wind really whips through.I think the weather, if it is as forecast, could play a big part and it might come down to who best manages the conditions.Shutting down the likes of Pauline Bourdon Sansus will be huge but I do believe Ireland can do it.A semi-final place would be absolutely huge and really highlight how far Ireland have come from the Wooden Spoon in the Six Nations in only 2023.A lot of people have had to stand up and say that what was happening wasn't good enough and it would make all of that hardship worthwhile because we're now seeing the rewards of people stepping up and fighting for the better of the game.

We've all wanted to see her back on pitch. She's been desperate to get back out there and give some of herself to the cause that we're undertaking," said Ireland head coach Scott Bemand."She's worked incredibly hard behind the scenes and there's been an incredible amount of support for her in getting her back to this point."We're fully confident she's fit and ready. She's desperate to get on the pitch, now it's just time to let her go."France: Bourgeois; Grisez; Menager, Vernier; Arbey; Queyroi, Boudron Sansus; Brosseau, Gerin, Bernadou; M Feleu, Fall Raclot; Bethoumieu, Champon, Escudero.Replacements: Bigot, Deshaye, Khalfaoui, Ikahehegi, Okemba, T Feleu, Chambon, Boulard.Ireland: Flood; Parsons, Dalton, Higgins, Costigan; O'Brien, Reilly; O'Dowd, Jones, Djougang, Campbell, Monaghan (capt), Tuite, Wafer, Hogan.Replacements: Moloney MacDonald, Perry, McGrath, Corri-Fallon, Moore, Lane, Breen, McGann.Image source, Getty Images

There is perhaps no phrase that strikes more fear into an Irish rugby supporter than World Cup quarter-final.The only senior Irish side to ever make the semi-finals of the global showpiece were the women's squad in 2014, a tournament that did not feature a last eight.When Scott Bemand's side face France in Sandy Park on Sunday afternoon, it will be their first time at the quarter-final stage since 1994 when they were beaten 76-0 by the United States.Throw in eight quarter-final losses from eight ties for the men's team and it is little wonder why these fixtures have come to be known as Irish Rugby's glass ceiling.Rather than have history weigh heavily on their shoulders, Amee-Leigh Costigan says the side are energised by the "do-or-die" nature of the fixture."It's a World Cup quarter-final, it's knockout stages, everybody's going to be going hard at it," said the winger who also turned out for Ireland Sevens at the Paris Olympics last year."I think probably the most exciting part is we're in this position to put our country in the best place."Obviously, it's all focused on putting out that performance and just being excited for it because there's not many chances that are do-or-die in this situation."Image source, Inpho
