The term describes skin that appears similar to crepe paper, appearing thin and crinkled, lacking elasticity and missing that thickness of youth. It’s also extremely common as it’s a byproduct of aging, menopause, sun exposure and various lifestyle choices.Well, while it’s impossible to completely get rid of the stuff using OTC skin care products, maintaining healthy, hydrated skin can definitely help aesthetics. We found an Olay moisturizer that one 53-year-old user in particular gives an absolutely glowing review: “Now after two months [of use, my] fine lines have disappeared and crepe skin is history. My skin looks like it did 10 years ago or more.”Advertisement
The two-ounce jar of Olay Plump and Hydrate Hyaluronic Gel moisturizer is ultra-nourishing, fragrance-free and has impressed hundreds of reviewers for improving their skin quality.$32 at AmazonThe two-ounce gel moisturizer is packed with hyaluronic acid (alleviates dryness) niacinamide (an antioxidant said to reduce fine lines) and peptides (helping to produce collagen). You just dab a small amount over your face and neck, and it’ll do its skin maintenance magic. While many users say they use theirs daily, most prefer using it before bed because it’s ultra-thick yet non-greasy. One even says that it’s so hydrating, they still feel it in the morning.Advertisement

If you need some extra encouragement, check out these happy reviews below.“I am 53 yrs old, and a lifelong sun worshipper. Fine lines and crepe skin were showing up mire and more. I started using this and within two days my skin started to improve. It is a light gel, and only need a tiny bit of this to cover your whole face. It keeps my skin hydrated for 24 hours, which is just amazing to me. Now after two months fine lines have disappeared, and crepe skin is history. My skin looks like it did 10 years ago or more. Am sold!” — Arrow Dog Rescue “This is my favorite nighttime moisturizer. First time I used it the texture threw me (it’s a super light gel) but it absorbs very quickly and keeps my face hydrated and feeling soft and smooth even when I have a lazy day and don’t wash my face in the morning! Doesn’t clog my pores and really helps with thirsty skin in the winter. I have super sensitive combination skin so sometimes my face is dry or oily and this stuff works well for me.” — Anna “This is an excellent night time moisturizer. I got it after it was recommended by a dermatologist as a good “drug store” option. A little goes a long way. It applies smoothly. It is definitely a night time lotion as it is a heavy moisturizer. After putting it on before bed, my skin feels soft and supple in the morning. Highly recommended. I use it at night along with the Olay eye cream. I’m almost out, but the tiny amount I have left will probably last another 2 weeks.” — Julie K. “Didn’t notice any scent, very rich and creamy. Using at night and in the morning, my skin is glowing. My previous moisturizer wasn’t doing the trick on my forehead. Using this 3 days and my mother asked me what I was using because my face was glowing! Highly recommend.” — Wanda Brown$32 at AmazonRelatedBeautyAmazonsalesskin care moisturizerTarget's 'Best Sheets Known To Man' Are Finally On Sale AgainThe Ring Doorbell And Stick-Up Cameras Are Up To 45% Off At These Selected Stores — But Not For LongReviewers Swear This Wearable Pain Relief Pad Is A 'Back Saver' And It's 20% Off If You HurryReviewers Say Their Crepey Skin Is ‘History’ After Using This Moisturizer — And It’s $23 Right Now Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
