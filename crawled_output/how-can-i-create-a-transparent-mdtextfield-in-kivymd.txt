I'm trying to create a fully transparent KivyMD MDTextInput. So far, I have tried this:
MDFloatLayout:
id: layout
MDTextField:
mode: "filled"
color: "Custom"
size_hint: 1, 1
fill_color_normal: 0, 0, 0, 0
fill_color_focused: 0, 0, 0, 0
text_color_normal: 0, 0, 0, 0
text_color_focused: 0, 0, 0, 0
MDTextFieldHintText:
text: "Start typing..."
But it's fully white (or the default off white)
KivyMD version: 2.0.1dev0
