I'm taking you back in time with these classic cheesy, saucy shells. This updated version is bursting with flavor, thanks to a creamy vodka sauce packed with sirloin and Italian sausage. —Tyler Smith, Virginia Beach, Virginia

4 tablespoons tomato paste
8 to 10 fresh basil leaves, sliced, plus more for garnish

Text Ingredients
Directions
In a large skillet, heat 1-2 tablespoons oil over medium heat. Add ground sirloin and sausage. Cook until no longer pink, 5-8 minutes, breaking into crumbles. Remove with a slotted spoon.
In the same pan, cook shallot until tender, 1-2 minutes, adding 1 tablespoon oil if needed. Add garlic, cook 1 minute longer. Add tomato paste and basil; cook until fragrant. If using, add vodka. Cook until liquid has reduced, 4-5 minutes.
Stir in heavy whipping cream and marinara sauce until combined; heat through. Add cooked beef mixture and Parmesan cheese. Reduce heat to a simmer. Cook until flavors have combined, 5-10 minutes.
Prepare pasta according to package directions, reserving 1/2 cup cooking liquid. Add cooking liquid and sauce to pasta; toss well to coat.
Top shells with mozzarella. Let melt or, if desired, heat under broiler. Garnish with additional Parmesan and basil.
