A splash of red wine and a shower of Parmesan give this veggie-loaded slow-cooker meatball soup its rich, comforting flavor.
Let’s talk about soup that eats like a meal. This one starts with a base of beef broth and red wine, which smells like it came from a recipe passed down to you by your Italian Nonna. Carrots and celery become tender without turning to mush, and the meatballs—yes, you’re allowed to use frozen meatballs—soak up all that garlicky, herby goodness while you do literally anything else. The tomatoes bring brightness, and the pasta adds heft.
Then comes the spinach, added just before serving so it stays vibrant. A finishing shower of Parmesan melts on contact, giving each bite a salty, creamy kick. The whole thing tastes like you cooked all day—even though the slow cooker did the work. Serve it with something crusty to mop up the broth, and you’ll have a dinner that’s warm, filling and as delightful as the stuff your favorite Italian joint serves.
Slow-Cooker Meatball Soup Ingredients
Carrots
Celery
Onion
Bay leaf
Italian seasoning
Pepper
Frozen cooked Italian meatballs
Beef broth
Italian diced tomatoes
Water
Red wine
Ditalini or other small pasta
Fresh baby spinach
Grated Parmesan cheese
Directions
Step 1: Combine the meat, vegetables and seasonings
Eric Kleinberg for Taste of Home
Add the carrots, celery, onion, bay leaf, Italian seasoning, pepper, meatballs, broth, tomatoes, water and wine to a 6-quart slow cooker.
Step 2: Slow-cook the soup
Cook the soup, covered, on low until the vegetables are tender and the flavors are blended, five to six hours.
Step 3: Add the pasta and spinach
Eric Kleinberg for Taste of Home
Stir in the pasta and cook, covered, on high until the pasta is tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Discard the bay leaf, then stir in the spinach until it’s wilted. Sprinkle the soup with cheese before serving it.

How to Store Slow-Cooker Meatball Soup
Let the soup cool completely, then transfer it to a food storage container and refrigerate it for up to four days. The pasta will continue to absorb liquid as it sits, so you may want to add a splash of water or broth when reheating the soup. For longer storage, freeze the soup—minus the pasta—for up to three months.
Slow-Cooker Meatball Soup Tips
Eric Kleinberg for Taste of Home
Can you use homemade meatballs to make meatball soup in a slow cooker?
Yes, you can make quick and simple meatballs for this meatball soup, but it’s best to cook them fully before adding them to the slow cooker.
What are good sides for this slow-cooker meatball soup?
Good side dishes to serve with slow-cooker meatball soup include crusty bread, garlic toast or a simple green salad. These sides complement the hearty flavors and help round out the meal.
Can you make crockpot meatball soup on the stovetop?
You can make crockpot meatball soup on the stovetop by simmering the first 11 ingredients in a large pot over medium-low heat for 30 to 40 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender and the flavors meld. Stir in the pasta and cook the soup for another 10 to 12 minutes, then add the spinach just before serving it.
