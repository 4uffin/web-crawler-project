It isn’t a party unless you've got some ribs in attendance! These single-serve ribs make for a great bite to take to any barbecue and can be prepared in less time than your typical rack of ribs. —Tyler Smith, Virginia Beach, Virginia

Ingredients
1 rack baby back ribs
6 to 8 tablespoons barbecue seasoning rub of choice
4 tablespoons unsalted butter
4 tablespoons hot or regular honey
1/2 cup apple cider vinegar
2 cups barbecue sauce of choice
Text Ingredients
Directions
Preheat grill to 325° (I suggest lighting one side of the burners to have a direct and an indirect side). Remove the rack of ribs from the package. To remove the membrane, work a butter knife under the membrane in the middle of the back side of the rack until it is mostly separated. Then, using a paper towel for grip, pull up on the middle of the membrane while simultaneously pushing the rack away until the membrane comes off.
Using a sharp knife, slice up the ribs. Coat each one evenly with your barbecue seasoning of choice.
Once the grill is preheated, place the ribs with space in between on the indirect side of the grill. Cook for 45 to 60 minutes. If you want smoke, either add wood chunks to the charcoal or place a smoking box on the direct heat side of a propane grill.
Remove the ribs and place them in a grill pan. Add the butter, honey, remaining barbecue seasoning and apple cider vinegar, and toss until fully coated. Cover the pan with aluminum foil and put the ribs back onto the grill for another 45 to 60 minutes or until fork tender (stick a fork into it and there is very little resistance).
Remove the ribs from the grill pan and place them back on the grill. Coat them with barbecue sauce of choice until fully glazed. Cook for an additional 30 to 45 minutes.
Remove ribs from the heat and let them rest 15 to 20 minutes before serving.
