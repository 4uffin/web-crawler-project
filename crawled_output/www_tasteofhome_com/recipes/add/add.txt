Quick Fix 5-Ingredient Main Dishes

From speedy chicken curry to short-cut sauerbraten, we’re looking for ethnic main dishes that come together in a snap. If your dinner has 5 ingredients or less (not counting water, oil, salt & pepper) we want to taste it!
Sheet Pan Suppers

Think crispy teriyaki tempeh with broccoli and pineapple or teriyaki glazed chops with sweet potatoes and asparagus. Or maybe a simple pan-roasted chicken cutlet with zucchini fries. Breakfast for dinner? Okay, that works too!
Copycat Recipes

As the weather cools down, our thoughts turn to soups and stews! We all love those warm and hearty soups you get at your favorite restaurants but can you make your own version of them? Can you create a version of Panera’s Bistro French Onion Soup or maybe their Summer Corn Chowder? How about Olive Garden’s Chicken & Gnocchi Soup? Or maybe the Lobster Bisque from Red Lobster? Let’s break out those Dutch ovens, chop those veggies and get to stewing up something tasty!
Be sure to include the name of the restaurant in the title of your recipe.
One-Dish Wonders
View Details
Hide Details
One-dish recipes are a blessing for the time-starved cook, and if we’re being totally honest, for those of us who just don’t want to clean up a lot of dishes. Dishes like General Tso’s Chicken & Cauliflower Casserole or Sheet Pan Maple-Glazed Chicken Thighs with Sweet Potatoes are just what we’re looking for. Let’s start creating recipes where everything, the veggies, starch and protein are all cooked in a single pot, pan, sheet try or baking dish.
Gluten-Free Baking

We're looking for your best gluten-free cakes, pies, muffins, cookies and more. Got a gluten-free chocolate cake you'd swear was the real deal? Let's see it!

Share your original baking recipes with us! Whether it’s a sweet mashup like crème brulee cookies or a trendy upgrade to a classic like Dubai chocolate brownies, we want to see your most delicious desserts! If you found a neat way to use that sourdough starter or developed a flavored focaccia that gets eaten up in a flash, we can’t wait to see it.
