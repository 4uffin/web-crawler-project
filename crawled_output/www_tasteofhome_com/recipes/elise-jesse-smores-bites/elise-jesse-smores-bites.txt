These sweet little bites are just as fun but way less messy than classic s'mores. I make my own marshmallow fluff, but you can use store-bought, too. —Elise Jesse, Cincinnati, Ohio

1 cup sugar
6 tablespoons water

Text Ingredients
Directions
Stir together gelatin and 1/4 cup cool water in a large mixing bowl; set aside.
Combine sugar, 6 tablespoons water, honey and vanilla in a saucepan. Bring to a boil. As soon as ingredients are incorporated, take the saucepan off the heat.
Using a whisk attachment on your stand or hand mixer, start on a low speed and slowly pour the hot syrup over the gelatin in the large mixing bowl.
When the ingredients have combined, turn the speed to high, and you'll have the white marshmallow fluff in a few minutes.
Break all the graham crackers into quarters and set them aside. Spread a thin layer of fluff down the middle of a graham cracker piece and top it with another cracker. Repeat until you’ve made the amount you need.
Melt chocolate in 30-second increments (don’t go over 1:30) and add coconut oil to the chocolate mixture.
Dip one half of each marshmallow graham cracker sandwich into the chocolate and set on parchment paper and a baking sheet. Sprinkle with flaky salt.
Place the finished s’mores bites into the refrigerator for 10 to 15 minutes.
