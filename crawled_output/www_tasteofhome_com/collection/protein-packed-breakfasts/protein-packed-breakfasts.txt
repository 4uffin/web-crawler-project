With at least 20 grams of protein per serving, these breakfast recipes will keep you energized all morning long, whether you have an hour or five minutes to spare.
As a busy mom and dietitian, I depend on high-protein breakfasts to keep me energized, focused and satisfied throughout my busy mornings. Eating breakfast jump-starts your metabolism, and incorporating high-protein foods into your morning meal has even more benefits. Protein helps slow down digestion, stabilize your energy levels and keep you full throughout the morning.
High-protein smoothies and shakes are perfect in a pinch (and I often depend on them for extra-chaotic mornings). However, I’m always looking for easy breakfast options that satisfy sweet and savory cravings. From biscuits and gravy to sandwiches, wraps, hearty quiches and high-protein egg breakfasts, every recipe in this collection has 20 grams or more of protein for a high-protein morning meal to start your day.
While I love a leisurely weekend breakfast, weekdays are another story. To help you stay fueled no matter how crazy your mornings are, you’ll find several easy-to-make recipes, including grab-and-go options, make-ahead breakfasts and meal prep bowls. And if eggs aren’t your thing, don’t fret! We have plenty of breakfast ideas without eggs. These recipes will make the dreaded breakfast rut a thing of the past!

High-Protein Breakfasts FAQWhat’s a good high-protein breakfast?A healthy, high-protein breakfast should include at least 20 grams of protein and other important nutrients like fiber and healthy fats. Recipes with fruits and vegetables are also a great option for a well-rounded breakfast. Try incorporating a veggie-packed rainbow quiche into your morning meal or serving fruit salad recipes on the side.How can I get 30 grams of protein for breakfast?With a bit of intention, you can easily get 30 grams of protein with your breakfast by combining protein-rich foods like dairy, nuts, seeds, eggs, meat and even legumes. For a meat-free option, enjoy high-protein cottage cheese pancakes with a Greek yogurt parfait. Or, if you enjoy eating meat, try a ham and cheese omelet, which has an impressive 41 grams of protein.What are the best high-protein meal prep ideas?To make your morning easier, you can meal prep breakfast recipes that store well and reheat easily, like freezer breakfast burritos, frittatas or egg muffins. Another great high-protein meal prep option is overnight oats, which can contain a lot of protein when made with ingredients like Greek yogurt, chia seeds, milk, nut butter or protein powder.
