I love a good hike as much as the next person, but thanks to my love of gaming and films, I’ll always be a bit of a couch potato. As a movie lover, my primary focus is finding living room furniture that fits my lounge-heavy lifestyle. I struggled to get cozy on my firm hand-me-down couch for years while cuddling up with my husband and cats to enjoy the latest blockbuster flicks. If only I had known then what I know now: The best modular sectional sofas make all the difference during family movie nights.
The Taste of Home team napped, lounged, laughed and cuddled up on 13 different sectionals to find the best modular sectionals for movie nights. These four options impressed us with their value, comfiness and overall aesthetics. Fire up your popcorn maker and gather up your favorite weighted stuffed animals—it’s time to get cozy!

Best Overall Modular Sectional
Lovesac Sactional
Shop on Lovesac
Pros:
High-quality performance fabric
Piece-meal assembly benefits hard-to-access rooms
Add-on accessories available
Wildly customizable
Machine washable covers
Cons:
Pricey
Time-consuming assembly
When it comes to choosing the best modular sectional for movie nights (or simply snuggling up on), it’s important also to consider the longevity of your purchase—especially if it’s on the pricey side. “I’m a big proponent of forever furniture,” says Senior Shopping Editor Katie Bandurski. “Meaning—I want to buy quality products that last a lifetime. And after ordering, building and testing a Lovesac Sactional, I’m confident this couch fits the bill.”
The Lovesac Sactional is built to last and isn’t just available in your standard size and fabric choices. In fact, it’s entirely customizable, from the arm shape (standard, angled or rolled) to the backrest to the configurations. Choose from a smaller three-seat option for cozier spaces and large, M-shaped picks that seat a minimum of 10. In addition, the fabric choices range from soft bouclé to luxe velvet, chenille, weave, cross weave, polyline, leather and even reversible textiles. And those are just the “quick ship” options—in total, there are over 130 different choices.
“After almost a year of daily use, the Lovesac couch still looks brand new. It’s the first thing you notice when entering our home, and guests always comment on its style and comfort,” says Katie. “Seriously, this is the best piece of furniture I’ve ever owned. It’s stylish, incredibly comfortable and easy to clean. We’re hosting family in a few weeks, and I love that I can convert the modular pieces into an additional guest bed. And if they spill? No sweat. I’ve successfully cleaned coffee, tomato sauce and chocolate off the covers with no remaining stains.”
KATIE BANDURSKI FOR TASTE OF HOME
One thing to remember is that, like most modular sectionals on the market, Lovesac sectionals require significant assembly. The process isn’t difficult, but it is time-consuming. Katie’s Lovesac furniture arrived in over 20 boxes and took over six hours to assemble. “At least I didn’t have to worry if the couch would fit through the doorframe, though!” Katie quips. “The boxes ensure this couch fits even in hard-to-access spaces like a basement or upstairs media room.”
Apart from the multi-box delivery, the only (slight) downside is that it shows a good amount of dirt, hair and debris. “I need to vacuum every few days to keep it in tip-top shape, but honestly, I’m glad it’s so visible. That means I can clean it immediately; a darker fabric would hide the dirt,” says Katie. Investing in a good cordless vacuum cleaner is key to keeping your new Lovesac sofa looking like new as the years go by.

EMILY WAY FOR TASTE OF HOME
Best Large Modular Sectional
Albany Park Kova Pit Sectional
Shop on Albany Park
Pros:
U-Shaped, bed-like configuration
Comes in a variety of fabrics
Simple assembly
30-day home trial
Lifetime warranty
Cons:
Boxes are large and heavy
Assembly can be tricky for the corners
I never expected to fall in love with a couch until I met my Albany Park Kova Pit sectional. It’s available in a variety of fabrics, from soft velvet to teddy bear bouclé to stain-resistant weaves and performance fabrics. I opted for the dark teal velvet with a storage ottoman for an additional fee. I recommend snagging the ottoman—it has been instrumental in organizing my small living space. While the Kova sectional is available in several sizes and configurations (with the option to add more sections later), the Kova Pit is perfectly designed for cuddling up on.
After receiving a call from the freight company and scheduling delivery, my modular sectional arrived in eight big, heavy Albany Park furniture boxes outside my apartment. I appreciated that the boxes were purposefully narrow, making it easy enough to maneuver them through doorways and upstairs. That said, these are heavy boxes, so if you have to move them upstairs, I highly recommend enlisting a few friends or movers for assistance.
To assemble, simply slide the backrests into place using a set of metal tracks on the base. The arms of the corner pieces were the trickiest part. Albany Park offers helpful videos if you, like me, find those areas tricky. The secret? Sliding them in at an angle allows them to sit flush and snug against the backrests. It took me around an hour and a half to assemble it myself. Once assembled, this thing is sturdy. While I don’t recommend it, I regularly stand on the armrests to put up my projector screen without issue.
EMILY WAY FOR TASTE OF HOME
Despite its inviting softness, the Albany Park couch’s velvet material still holds up well against cat claws and pet fur—just be sure to give it a once-over with your cordless vacuum regularly. This goes doubly so if you opt for the velvet material, which is a bit of a fur magnet. In terms of maintenance, like most cloud couches, you’ll also want to regularly fluff the cushions so they stay nice and puffy.
While it’s a bit more work than a traditional sofa, it’s totally worth it if you’re seeking unmatched coziness. I’m actually kind of glad that it needs a little visual upkeep—it’s a good reminder for someone like me who occasionally forgets to pull out the vacuum. As a bonus, I’ve had mine for over a year and it still looks and feels as plush and soft as day one!
One admirable feature of this Albany Park sofa is its flexible configuration. I set up mine in a long L-shape that best fits my small apartment, but the Pit is perfectly adjustable to nearly any space or room setup. You can even arrange it into a bed-like configuration for movie nights—something we do nearly every weekend. After staying on my Albany Park sectional for a few nights, a friend purchased one for her home. If that’s not a testament to the pull of this snuggly sofa, I don’t know what is.

MARY HENN FOR TASTE OF HOME
Best Small Modular Sectional
Burrow Mambo 4-Piece Sectional
Shop on Burrow
Pros:
Multiple fabric and size options
Small enough for tighter spaces
Easy setup, no tools needed
Modern design appeal
Cons:
Leather fabric may not be ideal for pet owners
Nothing says home movie night like a luxurious leather sectional. The Burrow Mambo 4-piece sectional in Camel transforms any basement or den space from lackluster to luxe, and its five-seat body offers plenty of space to spread out and get cozy. The firm-yet-soft build of this luxe leather modular sectional lends itself well to lounging without causing back pain. Plus, the smaller 100-inch length is compact enough for folks living in tight quarters.
A curved backrest and options for either low or high arms, depending on preference, make this a perfect option for those seeking a midday snore. We love that it’s wide and low to the ground, meaning it feels stable enough to support several people simultaneously. Concerned about cleaning your couch? Don’t worry—the top-grain leather (imported from a century-old tannery in Italy!) is also extremely easy to wipe down after accidental spills. Or, opt for the performance fabric for an ultra-tight weave that’s scratch- and stain-resistant.
“I’ve owned the Burrow Mambo for over a year now, and it still looks great,” says Editor Mary Henn of this modular sofa. “It hasn’t lost its shape and remains firm. I was worried about how the leather would hold up against kids and pets, but the fabric has been pretty resilient,” Mary says. “To be honest, I thought the couch would soften over time, but it hasn’t. We use the Mambo in our basement to watch sports when we have a few guests over. It’s perfect for that, but we prefer our softer, more plush sectional upstairs for curling up for naps.”
MARY HENN FOR TASTE OF HOME
However, Mary’s favorite thing about this Burrow sofa is its modular construction. The couch uses custom molded hardware to connect each piece, so it’s super easy to rearrange or take apart for moves. “You can arrange it multiple ways and even pull sections out to adjust the size of the sofa,” she says. “Plus, if you like rearranging your space frequently (to accommodate guests for a movie night, for instance), you can do that with this sectional.”
The only negatives Mary reports in her almost one year of Burrow couch ownership have to do with the fabric, which requires a little extra care if you opt for the leather version. “With any leather furniture, you’ll want to watch out for pets with long nails,” she notes. “However, I will say that the leather surface on this sectional feels thick, as though it would take a good amount of force and a sharp object to puncture through the surface.”

CHER CHECCHIO FOR TASTE OF HOME
Best Splurge Modular Sectional
7th Avenue Modular Chaise Sectional
Shop on 7th Avenue
Pros:
Water-repellent and stain-resistant fabrics
Washable covers
Extra-deep option
Complimentary fill packets included
Lifetime durability of 10 years or more
Cons:
Pricey
Low-back design may not be ideal for some
Family movie nights are fun, but with littles, it’s always best to be prepared for the resulting spills and stains. Former Editor Cher Checchio finds that added durability is worth paying for. “After four years, it was time to upgrade my old sectional with one that would better handle my toddler and dog. I knew I wanted a cloud couch, or at least a cloud couch dupe, but I also wanted a sectional that would fit my family and space,” Cher says. “The 7th Avenue 4-seat chaise modular sectional did just that and more.”
Cher opted for the four-seater modular couch with an extra deep ottoman. With the option to choose from ten different colors in performance fabrics (including velvet, textured and cross-weaves), she chose the ever-popular natural white with performance texture weave. The couch’s minimalistic look perfectly complements most spaces, from farmhouse-inspired decor to mid-century modern. We love that the PFAS-free coating also temporarily repels most household spills, giving parents plenty of time to chase down some paper towels.
About four weeks after purchasing, Cher’s modular sectional arrived in 17 boxes. She assembled the 7th Avenue couch in a couple of hours with the help of a video tutorial and her husband. 7th Avenue offers a limited lifetime warranty that includes a full warranty on the construction (frame, wood, springs, hardware) and manufacturer defects on the cushions and fabrics.
CHER CHECCHIO FOR TASTE OF HOME
They also offer free returns of the full merchandise value—minus shipping and assembly—within 10 days of delivery. Due to its overall durability, Cher expects to sit pretty on this sofa for way more than four years. And that’s a definite plus since, at around $5,700, the couch is rather pricey. That said, 12-, 24- and 36-month financing are available.
“Two of my favorite features of the 7th Avenue sectional are the removable covers and down alternative cushions. The water-repellent and stain-resistant fabric makes the covers easy to clean with a wet paper towel, but it’s also convenient to unzip each one—including the base, arms and backs—and wash them in the machine. The down alternative cushions are a lifesaver, too and not simply because they are hypoallergenic, vegan and cruelty-free. These no-hassle cushions maintain their shape without the need to fluff. Also, I love that the detached ottoman can sit on either end of the sofa, and the extra-deep cushions were oh-so-cozy,” says Cher.
Size(s) available: 2-9 seats | Colors: 10 | Customizable areas: Depth, firmness
Industry Trends for 2025
Modular sectionals are having a major moment in 2025, thanks to their unbeatable flexibility and stylish versatility. According to Summerlyn Feckner, owner and interior designer at Ginger Designs, this year’s trends are all about bold, vibrant colors and luxurious textures. Think plush velvets, cozy bouclés and sleek leathers in rich jewel tones like emerald green, deep sapphire and burnt orange.
“Modular sectionals are a game-changer because they offer unparalleled flexibility, allowing homeowners to customize their seating arrangements to fit any space, big or small,” Feckner explains. With endless configurations and eye-catching finishes, these sofas are proving to be the ultimate blend of function and fashion.
Why You Should Choose a Modular Sectional
“A modular sofa is a type of seating arrangement comprising individual sections (modules) that can be arranged and rearranged in different configurations. These modules typically include pieces like seats, ottomans, chaises, and corners that can be combined to fit various room layouts and preferences,” says interior designer Andy Yates from Andy Yates Design.
According to Andy, there are several reasons why you may prefer a modular sofa to other designs:
Flexibility: You can change the arrangement to suit different occasions or room layouts.
Customization: Tailor the sofa to your specific seating needs by adding or removing modules.
Versatility: Modules can be used separately as additional seating or combined for larger gatherings.
Thanks to their ultra-flexible configurations and soft, inviting fluff, it’s hard to resist the pull of modular sectionals when it comes to family film nights. Nothing beats firing up the projector and curling up with your kids, pets and a pile of fuzzy blankets after a long week.
However, justifying such a pricey purchase is hard without trying out your potential picks. Luckily, our team of editors volunteered our living rooms to try out over a dozen different sectionals to find the best options for every home
What to Look for When Buying a Modular Sectional Sofa
Are you shopping for a sectional modular couch? There are a few key things to keep in mind:
Room size: Always measure your space prior to purchasing a new piece of furniture to ensure it will fit!
Budget: Modular couches typically cost between $800 and $5,000 or more. While you can find some nice budget options, consider longevity. Sometimes, it’s worth paying a bit more upfront for lasting quality. Many stores also offer financing to help make their couches a bit more affordable.
Chaise vs. no chaise: A chaise is a long seat meant for lounging. Some modular sofas have one, while others do not.
Configurability: The amazing thing about modular sectionals is how configurable they are. This makes it easy to arrange them in a way that fits into your space. Look for options that are easy to connect to each other and offer flexibility in terms of arrangement to get the most out of your couch.
Ease of cleaning: Many of the options on this list offer performance fabrics, which are typically coated to make them stain- and spill-resistant. These are excellent choices for families with kids and pets.
Shipping and delivery: Getting a new piece of furniture delivered can be a bit of a headache. To make the process easier, opt for a pick that arrives in boxes that fit through door frames and upstairs. This ensures you’ll be able to maneuver your couch into the right room.
Assembly: Most sectionals ordered online require assembly. While this can take a few hours, choosing a modular sectional with clear instructions makes the process go by a lot quicker.
There are a few additional areas to consider for families that want to create an inviting space to watch their favorite flicks. According to Andy, think about the following:
Modular Sofa Configuration: Opt for a modular sofa with a chaise or one or more ottomans that can serve as a comfortable spot to stretch out during the movie.
Storage Solutions and Tech: Include a coffee table/side table or ottoman with built-in storage compartments for snacks and drinks. Consider furnishings with drink holders, table surfaces and charging elements (ports or wireless) built in. This can make controlling the media in the room easier and more efficient.
Cozy Textiles: Use throws and cushions in soft, cozy fabrics like fleece or velvet for added comfort.
Adjustable Lighting: Install dimmable lights or use floor lamps with adjustable heads to create the right ambiance during movie screenings.
Sound Considerations: If possible, arrange the furniture to optimize the room’s acoustics for better sound quality. Soft surfaces like textile wallpapers and closed draperies help absorb sound and limit reverberation around the room’s hard surfaces.
“When focusing on media in a family room, I often incorporate as many textiles as possible: carpet, furnishings, draperies, and acoustic wallcoverings. This helps to create a more theater-like atmosphere where the focus is on the media and not the unwanted noises created by reverberation off of hard surfaces,” says Andy.
“I also like to employ medium and darker colors in these spaces to reflect less light and create a rich, moody atmosphere. Of course, having an incredibly comfortable and durable sofa is often the linchpin to the success of these spaces.”
By incorporating these elements, you can create a cozy and functional space that enhances the experience of family movie nights in your home!

FAQ
KATIE BANDURSKI FOR TASTE OF HOME
Are modular sofas a good idea?
For some, a modular sofa sectional is an excellent investment. For others, they may not be the best choice. Consider your family’s needs and space before choosing a new couch. This will help ensure you pick the correct size and style.
“In smaller spaces, the use of a modular sofa is often an easy solution for the clients— and the best one. Their flexibility and scale make installing and arranging them easy for maximum function and comfort,” says Andy. “Several vendors have customization options that continue to make these pieces as unique as each client and as affordable options for those on a limited budget.”
What is the difference between modular and sectional sofas?
Modular and sectional sofas may look similar, but the two have key differences. According to Andy, a modular sectional couch offers more flexibility as you can customize the layout based on your needs. “Modules can be rearranged or added to create different seating arrangements. The smaller sections can be grouped together more easily than a sectional,” he says. “Sectional Sofas usually come in predefined configurations with fixed shapes (L-shape, U-shape, etc.) and are less flexible in terms of customization.”
In addition, Andy notes that modular sofas are easier to move and install in tight spaces because they typically come in smaller pieces. On the other hand, sectional sofas may be more challenging to maneuver due to their larger single-piece structure.
Why are modular couches so expensive?
Couches are already pricey, but a modular sectional sofa is often even more so. According to Andy, there’s a reasonable explanation for why. The ability to customize the configuration and choose different modules adds to the cost. In addition, higher-quality materials and craftsmanship are often used to ensure that modules fit together seamlessly and securely. Engineering modular pieces that fit together well and provide stability requires more design effort and investment. That said, modular sofas are not necessarily more expensive than sectionals.
“The investment depends on the quality of the furniture: Where and how was it made, using what labor practices and materials? All types of sofas have options that vary significantly with regard to price,” says Andy. “I find that always discussing the budget with a client, understanding their specific needs and desired investment, and selecting the right pieces for function and aesthetics is the best approach to selecting these larger, key pieces in any room.”
