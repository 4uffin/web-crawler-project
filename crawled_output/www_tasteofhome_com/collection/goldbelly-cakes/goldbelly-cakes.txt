Original PieCaken
Shop on Goldbelly
For the over-the-top Goldbelly cakes fan, you can’t do much better than a PieCaken. It features pecan pie on the bottom, pumpkin pie in the middle and spice cake on top. It’s layered together with cinnamon buttercream and topped with apple pie filling.
“My two favorite layers were the pumpkin pie and cinnamon buttercream, so eating them together was a true treat,” says senior editor Caitlyn Fitzpatrick, who wrote our review of the cake. “The PieCaken allowed me to make my own special bites of different desserts I wouldn’t have normally put together on the same utensil.” There’s also a Christmas version!

You don’t need to be airborn to enjoying biting into the Hummingbird Cake from Savannah’s Candy Kitchen. This fruity cake comes jam-packed with bananas, pecans, and pineapple, finished off with an envelopment of smooth cream cheese frosting. This crowd-pleasing favorite is an excellent addition to both holiday celebrations and summertime get-togethers alike!

JFK's Wedding Cake
Shop on Goldbelly
JFK’s wedding cake is a showstopping gift for bakers and history buffs alike. Boasting ample layers of white cake, raspberry preserves, raspberry frosting and vanilla buttercream, this luxury dessert is sure to leave an impression (and never an empty stomach).
“The texture of the cake was light and fluffy. It wasn’t overly moist, which worked well with the fillings,” says reviewer Molly Allen. “It was beautifully balanced between the white cake, filling and frosting.”

Mortgage Apple Cakes
Shop on Goldbelly
Model and actress Angela Logan originally sold her home-baked apple cake after being faced with foreclosure. Thus, Mortgage Apple Cakes was born! Moist, delicious and surrounded by a delightful cream cheese frosting, Mortgage Apple Cakes are a delightful treat during fall, winter, or whenever. Just don’t expect it to last more than a few days—it’s hard to eat just one slice!

Caroline's Cakes 7-Layer Caramel Cake
Shop on Goldbelly
Caroline’s Cakes is the brand behind one of the most iconic Southern-style caramel cakes. “Cutting into the 7-Layer Caramel Cake was dreamy. The layers are really impressive,” says Shopping Editor Mary Henn. “The cake has very delicate sponge layers with generous layers of dense, sugary caramel.”
“The natural icing pattern had several family members asking if I made the cake myself,” Mary adds. “The cake received several compliments on its taste, and people wanted to know where I’d gotten it. It was a big hit with my family, who loved the caramel flavor.” For a seasonal twist, try out the 7-layer pumpkin cake!
The cake bites from Caroline’s Cakes are just as delightful as their larger, multilayered cousins. Senior Shopping Editor Katie Bandurski tried their small-yet-mighty lemon cake bites and loved the zippy, bright flavors of the lemon curd and buttercream. But if you’re not into lemon, don’t worry—there are other flavors to choose from, like the brand’s famous caramel!

Cinnamon Walnut Coffee Cake
Shop on Goldbelly
Known for their classic Slovenian povitica, Strawberry Hill bakery has been tempting tastebuds since 1908. While they’re best known for their swirled pastries, its patrons can attest to the fantastic quality of its cinnamon walnut coffee cake. This classic cold weather breakfast brings a touch of tangy sour cream along with a thick ribbon of cinnamon sugar in the center. At only $15 per cake, it’s a total bargain for breakfast eaters!

Pumpecapple Piecake

Having a big gathering and want to invest in a surefire crowd pleaser? Opt for the formidable Pumpecapple Piecake. This behemoth confection appeals to a number of folks, thanks to its diverse yet delectable layers. Inside is a pumpkin pie baked in a pumpkin spice cake, an award-winning pecan pie baked in a chocolate cake and an apple pie baked in a traditional spice cake. Each cake—along with each layer—comes with a generous helping of cream cheese frosting to boot. The best part? It feeds up to 40 people!

Angelina's of Maryland Smith Island Cake
Shop on Goldbelly
“People think Maryland is just about crabs and seafood (OK, it is phenomenal there), but Angelina’s of Maryland is iconic,” says content director Nicole Doster. The Smith Island cake originates from Maryland’s only inhabited island in the Chesapeake Bay. It features nine (!!!) layers of ultra-thin yellow cake separated by cooked chocolate icing—a total crowd-pleaser.

Giant Sweet Potato Pound Cake
Shop on Goldbelly
Sweet potato is the ultimate autumn ingredient, but why settle for a boring old pie? The Giant Sweet Potato Pound Cake from Southern Girl Desserts is warm, decadent and oh so memorable. Spices like cinnamon and nutmeg along with a drizzle of cream cheese icing give it a fall feel that’s perfect for cozy nights in.

Brooklyn Blackout Cake
Shop on Goldbelly
Brooklyn’s bustling streets house quite a few bakeries, but Brooklyn Blackout Company is easily one of the most famous. Originally sold by the now-defunct Ebinger’s storefront, their chocolatey buttercream Blackout Cake is a recreation of the original 1970s lost recipe. Try a taste of historical Brooklyn without ever leaving the comfort of home with this storied favorite.
While I haven’t tried their customer-favorite cake, I did receive a dozen of their Blackout Cookies from Goldbelly’s cookie of the month club. Spoiler: I totally understand why customers sing this bakery’s praises!

Ina Garten's Coconut Cake
Shop on Goldbelly
Ina Garten’s coconut cake might be one of the most popular Goldbelly cakes there is—that’s for a good reason. Developed by the Barefoot Contessa herself, each snow-white cake holds layers of fluffy white cake, coconut flakes and tangy cream cheese icing. Choose from either a six-inch cake that feeds up to eight or a bigger eight-inch cake for up to 12 guests. It also makes a great gift for families!

Duff Goldman and his legendary cakes earned quite a reputation thanks to the baker’s fun-loving nature. Try one of Duff’s famous recipes, like the popular vintage lemon blueberry cake, on his Goldbelly cakes shop. Bursting with flavor thanks to four layers of lemon cake studded with whole blueberries, this bright and cheery cake makes an excellent birthday cake delivery for friends and family.
Looking for a autumn option? Duff’s bakery also offers a peanut butter Halloween cake and a fall-inspired pumpkin spice cake.

Carlo's Bakery Rainbow Cake
Shop on Goldbelly
Carlo’s Bakery was founded by Carlo Guastaffero in Hoboken, New Jersey, in 1910. Since then, it has skyrocketed to fame with the help of the TLC show “Cake Boss.” This rainbow cake is one of their most popular offerings, due in large part to the mesmerizing and colorful layers containing a signature sweet vanilla icing. Enjoy this six layered behemoth in as soon as two days when you order it on Goldbelly—no cake decorating supplies required!
FAQ
What is Goldbelly?
Goldbelly is the go-to place for foodies who can’t stop thinking about the pizza they devoured in Detroit or the bagels they bought in New York. Goldbelly food gifts are some of the most nostalgic and creative culinary creations available online. Their listings cover everything from tropical pineapples fresh from Maui to one-of-a-kind, hand-dipped chocolates, all from customer-hyped restaurants and bakeries spanning across America.
Over the years, I’ve tried dozens of their delectable sweet and savory offerings through their all-encompassing food subscription, all which I can sum up in one word: YUM. No other service covers such extensive ground in the realm of food gifts. But most impressive is their selection of cakes from world-famous bakeries.
Does Goldbelly ship frozen?
Most cakes from Goldbelly ship frozen with dry ice or ice packs. Some thawing can occur in transit, so it’s important to get your cake inside ASAP, especially if you live in a warm climate.
How do you defrost a Goldbelly cake?
If your Goldbelly cake arrives frozen, remove any plastic wrap and place it back in its bakery box or tin. Then, stick it in the fridge. Let the cake thaw in the fridge overnight and pull it out two hours before serving. Slice, serve and dig in!
