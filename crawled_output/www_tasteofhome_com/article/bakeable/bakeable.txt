Take Our Baking Challenge
Each month, we’ll challenge you to bake one of our most-loved recipes along with us. We’ll teach new tips and techniques to help you become a better baker. You can ask questions about the bake, share your tips with others and post your photos in our Bakeable Facebook group and on your own social media with the hashtag #bakeable. We want to highlight your successes, so we’ll share your photos and stories. Take pics as you bake, and be sure to show us your finished product!
This month, we’re kicking off autumn with an apple treat. Apple monkey bread is a fun bake for a Saturday. Apples, cinnamon and pecans fill the homemade rolls, which are topped with a vanilla icing. Pull ’em apart and share with a friend.
Happy baking!
