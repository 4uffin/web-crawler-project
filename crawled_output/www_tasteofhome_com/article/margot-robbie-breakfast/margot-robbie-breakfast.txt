She's a millennial through and through!
Margot Robbie is without a doubt one of the biggest stars of the moment. I’ve been a huge fan of her work since her role as Tonya Harding in I, Tonya. She and Ryan Gosling were absolutely iconic together in Barbie. Soon, we’ll see Margot as Catherine in the upcoming adaptation of Wuthering Heights. And just this week, the newest film in her portfolio, A Big Bold Beautiful Journey, premiered.
When she’s not on set, she’s most likely working on her alcohol brand, Papa Salt. It’s an Australian-based, award-winning gin company that she launched with her husband and friends.
I wondered what she eats to keep up her energy for such a busy calendar. And honestly, as a fellow millennial, I am not surprised!
What does Margot Robbie eat for breakfast?
It turns out that she has a very specific avocado toast order. Rather than smashing a few pieces of avocado on toast and calling it a day, she turns hers into a veritable feast by adding grilled halloumi and Australian bacon (a leaner, less fatty cut than American-style bacon). I love the idea of dressing up a basic combo like avocado and bread with a protein!
And when she isn’t ordering avocado toast, she is having porridge with blackberries and a smoothie. She has said in interviews that she particularly likes green smoothies (like Reese Witherspoon), and her favorite recipe includes kale, apple and banana. What I love most about Margot Robbie’s go-to breakfast is that it’s something relatable that I could whip up right now.
Oatmeal and porridge is certainly a popular celeb breakfast, considering that people like Kate Middleton, Ina Garten and Willie Nelson all enjoy it in the morning!
