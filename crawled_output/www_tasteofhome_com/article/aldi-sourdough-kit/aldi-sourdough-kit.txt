It's a loaf story, baby, just say bread.
It’s been a very busy year for Taylor Swift. She’s fresh off of her record-breaking Eras Tour, she just regained ownership of all of her master recordings, and she recently got engaged to Travis Kelce. If this was a movie, well, the credits would be playing right now.
But if I’ve learned anything from following Taylor Swift, it’s that she never stops creating. In fact, her twelfth studio album, The Life of a Showgirl, drops in just two weeks. The studio isn’t the only place where she gets in the creative mood though. On a recent episode of the New Heights podcast, Taylor revealed some of her favorite hobbies. Or, as she put it, “I’d say all my hobbies could be categorized as, like, hobbies you could have had in the 1700s.”
We know Taylor likes baking cookies, and it turns out that another of those hobbies is making sourdough bread. I need to know who feeds her starter when she’s on tour! Details aside, I’ve been trying to get motivated to get back into sourdough. The stars seem to have aligned, because Aldi just dropped a sourdough kit that has everything you need. Or should I say, knead.
What’s in Aldi’s sourdough kit?

Making sourdough bread requires a few advanced techniques and special tools. Think of this Aldi sourdough kit as having everything but the sourdough starter. It includes:
Bench scraper: You’ll need this to divide the dough and to shape the dough into a loaf while creating surface tension.
Dough whisk: Different from French whisks and flat whisks, a dough whisk is made specifically for thicker batters and doughs.
Lame with two blades: Bread lames are one of the essential bread baking tools. Use these to score your loaves with all sorts of designs (besides aesthetics, scoring bread lets steam escape for a more even bake).
Proofing basket: Also called a banneton, this is a lined basket that helps keep the shape of your loaf while it proofs.
The best part is that you get all of these materials for $14.99. It’s an incredible value, especially since you can use these tools over and over again to make plenty of loaves.
When is Aldi’s sourdough kit available?
This kit is available right now at Aldi stores nationwide, while supplies last. Since it’s an Aldi Find, it lives by the store’s “here today, gone tomorrow” credo. That means that once they’re sold out, they’re gone for good. So if you’re ready to enter your sourdough era, then it’s time to take a “Getaway Car” to Aldi!
