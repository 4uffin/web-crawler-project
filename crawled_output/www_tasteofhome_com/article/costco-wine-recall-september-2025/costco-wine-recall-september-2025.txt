Check your wine rack and your fridge.
If you picked up a bottle of Kirkland Signature Prosecco Valdobbiadene at Costco earlier this year, then you’ll want to double-check your stash. Costco has issued a recall for certain bottles due to a safety issue that could cause them to break unexpectedly—even if they’re just sitting unopened on your wine rack. Here’s what you need to know.
What caused the recall?
According to a notice sent to Costco members, some bottles of the Prosecco may spontaneously shatter—even if they haven’t been touched. That’s a serious safety risk, as flying glass could cause injury. Costco and Ethica Wines (the product’s importer) are urging members to check their bottles and handle them with care.
What stores sold the wine?
This recall only affects Kirkland Signature Prosecco Valdobbiadene, which is a Costco-exclusive brand. If you purchased Prosecco from Costco in any of the following states, it could be part of the recall: Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, North Dakota, Nebraska, Ohio, South Dakota and Wisconsin.
How do I know if I have a recalled wine?
Here’s what to look for:
Kirkland Signature Prosecco Valdobbiadene
Item number on the label: 1879870
Purchase date: Between April 25, 2025 and August 26, 2025
Costco location you purchased from was in one of the states listed above
If all of those match, your wine bottle is affected.
What should I do next?
Do not try to open the bottle, and do not bring it back into the store. To safely dispose of it, wrap it in paper towels, put it in a plastic bag, and place it in the trash. Then, bring the recall notice (or just your receipt) to your local Costco for a full refund.
If you have questions, you can contact Ethica Wines at [email protected] or by calling 786-810-7132 Monday through Friday between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. EST.
