Community Cook of the Month
Taste of Home, Courtesy Susan Bickta
Susan Bickta from Kutztown, Pennsylvania
Susan Bickta is married and has a pet cat named KirbyKat. She got her love for cooking from watching her mother and Julia Child cook. Susan has attempted to make the dishes featured on Julie Child’s cooking show, her favorite being Beef Wellington.
Susan has been involved in many cooking contests since 2010, a time when she was facing brain surgery and needed something to concentrate on and keep her busy. She has won many contests, including first place in her category for the U.S. Oyster Festival Cook-off, second place in the Legendary Lentil Festival Cook-off and grand prize in the Fisher Nuts “My Fresh Twist” Contest, in which her recipe was picked as the winner by Chef Alex Guarnaschelli. Susan has also served as a culinary judge for the Great Allentown Fair for the past 8 years.
Taste of Home: How long have you been a fan of Taste of Home?
Susan Bickta: For many years, going back to the 1990s.
TOH: What’s the next cooking skill you want to master?
SB: I’d love to try making French macarons!
TOH: What’s your favorite kitchen hack that you now live by?
SB: Cutting my pot pie noodles with a pizza cutter.
TOH: What is something you no longer buy from the store or at restaurants because you know you can make it better at home?
SB: I recently purchased a multi-cooker, and I now use the pressure cooker feature to make my own chicken and ham stock. It tastes so much better when it’s homemade.
