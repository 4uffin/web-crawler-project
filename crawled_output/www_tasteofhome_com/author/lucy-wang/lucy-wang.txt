Articles & Recipes
Lucy Wang’s Mini Chashu Ramen Umami in a bowl! Super tender braised chashu pork slices with a rich broth, bouncy noodles, and a jammy and flavorful ramen egg—it’s literally the perfect bite. Even my picky 2 year old fell in love with slurping away this bowl of goodness. It’s a great recipe to prepare in advance, and even better as leftovers or as a meal prep. —Lucy Wang, Los Angeles, California
Lucy Wang’s Mini Jellycat Cakes A super cute cake that’s mini so you can indulge in just a few bites? Say less. You’ll need one sheet pan and one cookie cutter for these adorable single-serve cakes that deliver big flavor in a charmingly small package. —Lucy Wang, Los Angeles, California
Lucy Wang’s Shoestring Fries These garlic Parmesan shoestring fries might just ruin all other fries for you. Ultra-thin and dangerously crispy, they're fried to golden perfection and absolutely drenched in garlicky, buttery goodness, then buried under a snowfall of freshly grated Parmeggiano Reggiano. You may never go back to basic fries. —Lucy Wang, Los Angeles, California
