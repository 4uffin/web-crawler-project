We have joined forces to launch CodeSandbox SDK and bring code interpretation to generative AI.Learn more ChangelogcommitCodeSandbox SDK RCWe are back with a major update to CodeSandbox SDK, which we're officially announcing soon.Hello there üëã
We've been hard at work over the past few months building the new CodeSandbox SDK to allow you to use CodeSandbox infrastructure and features in new and exciting ways.
We'd like to take this opportunity to thank you, our early adopters. You've provided us with your detailed feedback, worked with us to debug problems and more broadly, you've stuck with us!
As the SDK has matured, a common theme in your feedback has been that the API hasn't been as intuitive as you and we would like it to be. This release candidate includes a comprehensive overhaul of the surface API to make it more accessible, consistent and also make it easier for us to support more features in the future.
We encourage you to read through the RC Docs and use the shiny new playground to test some of these new features (playground sneak peek below).
Try the new SDK now: npm install @codesandbox/sdk@rc
Mental model
Before we jump into the new features, let's do a quick recap of the mental model to use the new SDK:
// Management of all resources
const sdk = new CodeSandbox();
// Management of preview tokens
sdk.previewTokens;
// Management of sandboxes
sdk.sandboxes;
For sandbox resources, the mental model is:
// Manage sandboxes without a session
sdk.sandboxes.create();
sdk.sandboxes.resume("sandbox-id");
sdk.sandboxes.restart("sandbox-id");
sdk.sandboxes.shutdown("sandbox-id");
sdk.sandboxes.hibernate("sandbox-id");
// Create a session to interact
sandbox.connect();
sandbox.createBrowserSession();
sandbox.createRestSession();
What's new?
+-3Support for environment variables üîë
This has been one of the top-requested features for quite a while! Now, the SDK has
support for environment variables for your sessions, bound to any command or terminal
instances created.
+-3Select a git source ‚úîÔ∏è
You can now select a git source for a Sandbox, which allows you to clone a repo.
+-3Preview API üì∫
Our new Preview API allows you to interact with the preview iFrame in the browser. You can try this now on our playground!
+-3Automatic reconnect handling üîÑÔ∏è
The browser connection to a Sandbox now has automatic reconnect handling.
+-3Snapshots deployed to all clusters üåê
Now, when you build templates using the CLI, we will deploy the snapshots to all our clusters. Below you can see an example where the snapshot was deployed to our fc-eu-2 and fc-us-1 clusters (several additional clusters are available).
Other New Features & Improvements
+-3Tasks are now enhanced with features to manage the task and open its shell output.
+-3You can now pass Git credentials to a session to manage git in a Sandbox.
CodeSandbox SDK Breaking Changes
If you are moving from 0.12.x to the release candidate, it can be a good idea to read through the docs, as there are several surface API changes. The most noticeable are:
shells are removed in favor of higher dedicated abstractions called terminals, commands , interpreters , setup and tasks . They all abstract the lower-level shell with accessible methods and behaviors for consuming the underlying shells.
Separation of Sandbox instance and Sessions.
And there you have it!
We hope you're as excited as we are about all these updates, especially as we get closer to a full release.
Thank you again for continuing to share your feedback with us to help us make the SDK better for everyone.
Have fun building and see you soon üëãcommitPrivate preview support, auto-wake & CodeSandbox SDK improvementscommitCodeSandbox SDK sessions API, list running sandboxes & many improvementscommitJoining Together AI, launching CodeSandbox SDK & tons of improvementscommitNew Status Page, Sandpack Accessibility Improvements and Tons of FixescommitNew Template Picker, Sandpack Static File Support and Several ImprovementscommitNew Editor Powered by Web VS Code, Test Runner, and Several ImprovementscommitWeb VS Code Beta and Several ImprovementscommitStorybook Add-on, SOC 2, Unlimited Public Sandboxes and morecommitVS Code Web, Extension Marketplace and Dashboard UpdatescommitNew Repo Import Flow, Annual Plans, Better AI and UX ImprovementscommitVM Resizing and Dashboard & Editor ImprovementscommitCodeSandbox CDE, Usage-based Billing, and Live SessionscommitUnified Platform, Codeium and VS Code editorcommitEnterprise, Dev Containers, GPT-4 and VS Code extension updatecommitAI Commit Messages 2.0, new command palette and morecommitSSO, VIM mode, dependency picker and Chrome DevToolscommitCode reviews, editor updates and custom themescommitBoxy AI assistant, Go support, VS Code overhaul, and editor updatescommitPHP support, faster microVMs and better stabilitycommitSeamless branching, workspace scopes, Python support and many morecommitDocker support, Rust, seamless branching and much morecommitCloud Sandboxes for iOS & VS Code, new onboarding and morecommitNew dashboard, repositories and cloud sandboxescommitThe realtime multiclient collaboration updatecommitGitHub App updates, better Astro support and a new login methodcommitVS Code Insider support, faster project imports and much morecommitSandpack meets Dracula, support for custom NPM registries and bug fixescommitBetter list-view and rename branches from the command palettecommitPublic beta, new documentation and GiHub AppcommitAlways on previews, VScode improvements and better UI consistencies.commitSandpack June UpdatecommitBinary files on mobile, more syntax highlights and repository renames.commitDrag and drop file upload, better framework support and more.commitFirecracker by default, more storage and more FPS.commitSandpack April & May UpdatecommitProtected branches, bulk discard and relative file path.commitCodeSandbox May UpdatecommitSandpack March UpdatecommitAnnouncing CodeSandbox ProjectscommitSandpack February UpdatecommitMeet the new CodeSandboxcommitSandpack January UpdatecommitSandpack Devtools have landedcommitWelcome to our release notesUse CasesCodeSandbox SDKCode in SandboxesStorybook IntegrationLearn & ExperimentEcosystemFeaturesVS Code ExtensionSandpackStatusPricingExploreDiscoverChangelogDocumentationBlogCompanyAboutSupportCareersBrand kitCopyright ¬© 2025 CodeSandbox BV, a Together AI company.
