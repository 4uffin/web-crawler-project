Read the Docs Get started in secondsnpm install @codesandbox/sdkimport { CodeSandbox } from "@codesandbox/sdk";
const sdk = new CodeSandbox();
const sandbox = await sdk.sandbox.create();
const result = await sandbox.shells.python.run("print(1+1)");
// Live clone the sandbox to a second version
const sandbox2 = await sandbox.fork();
// Checkpoint the sandbox by hibernating it
await sandbox.hibernate();
checkSupports VM snapshot/restore & cloning within seconds.checkPersistence of sandboxes using git source control.checkPrebuild custom snapshots using Docker.checkFully integrates with Together AI inference.checkData centers close to you (US, APAC or EMEA)Built for AI agents and moreAI agentsGive agents a sandbox to resolve user prompts, or create autonomous agents running on sandboxes. You can run multiple agents in parallel without them interfering with each other. Using the forking mechanism, you can also A/B test different agents.Development environments at scaleCreate a sandbox for each developer or student, and run their code in the sandbox. This way, you can run multiple development environments in parallel without them interfering with each other.Secure code interpretation & evalsRun code in a sandbox to interpret it. This way, you can run untrusted code without worrying about it affecting your system. You can also run popular evals on any piece of code.CI/CDRun tests inside a sandbox, and hibernate the sandbox when the tests are done. This way, you can quickly start the sandbox again when you need to run the tests again or evaluate the results.Secure code generation at scaleSettingsPowerful APIsUse our APIs to create isolated development environments (sandboxes) that can run any type of code you need.LockSecure & isolatedEvery environment runs in isolation, so you can safely run untrusted code without it affecting your system.DnsReady for scaleWe can handle millions of concurrent VMs and make it easy to provision, manage and decommission VMs.CloudContinuous contextResume development within the same sandbox after periods of inactivity. With no loss thanks to our snapshots.SyncQuick start & auto resumeOur microVM infrastructure allows us to spin up entire VMs, clone them and restore snapshots within 2 seconds.ScheduleCustomizable hibernationGain total control over periods of inactivity before auto hibernation kicks in.Frequently asked questionsDo I need a CodeSandbox workspace to be able to use the SDK?Yes. You need a CodeSandbox API key to use CodeSandbox SDK, which you can get by creating a CodeSandbox account.What is the pricing of CodeSandbox SDK?How long does the SDK take to create a sandbox?What are memory snapshots?Are there any SDK rate limits?Can I use the same CodeSandbox plan for SDK and non-SDK usage?Is it possible to self-host CodeSandbox SDK?Start building todaynpm install @codesandbox/sdkRead the Docs
