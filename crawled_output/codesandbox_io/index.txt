We have joined forces to launch CodeSandbox SDK and bring code interpretation to generative AI.Learn more Sandboxesbuilt for scaleProgrammatically spin up isolated sandboxes for instant code execution in your AI agents and code playgrounds.Start for free Try CodeSandbox SDK chevron_rightSecure code generation at scaleSettingsPowerful APIsUse our APIs to create isolated development environments (sandboxes) that can run any type of code you need.LockSecure & isolatedEvery environment runs in isolation, so you can safely run untrusted code without it affecting your system.DnsReady for scaleWe can handle millions of concurrent VMs and make it easy to provision, manage and decommission VMs.CloudContinuous contextResume development within the same sandbox after periods of inactivity. With no loss thanks to our snapshots.SyncQuick start & auto resumeOur microVM infrastructure allows us to spin up entire VMs, clone them and restore snapshots within 2 seconds.ScheduleCustomizable hibernationGain total control over periods of inactivity before auto hibernation kicks in.Built for AI agents and moreAI agentsGive agents a sandbox to resolve user prompts, or create autonomous agents running on sandboxes. You can run multiple agents in parallel without them interfering with each other. Using the forking mechanism, you can also A/B test different agents.Development environments at scaleCreate a sandbox for each developer or student, and run their code in the sandbox. This way, you can run multiple development environments in parallel without them interfering with each other.Secure code interpretation & evalsRun code in a sandbox to interpret it. This way, you can run untrusted code without worrying about it affecting your system. You can also run popular evals on any piece of code.CI/CDRun tests inside a sandbox, and hibernate the sandbox when the tests are done. This way, you can quickly start the sandbox again when you need to run the tests again or evaluate the results.Template universeStart with your favorite stack.No templates found.Explore templates0 million+users0+repositories connected0+organizations0.0 billion+lines of code writtenJoin the future of buildingStart for freeUse CasesCodeSandbox SDKCode in SandboxesStorybook IntegrationLearn & ExperimentEcosystemFeaturesVS Code ExtensionSandpackStatusPricingExploreDiscoverChangelogDocumentationBlogCompanyAboutSupportCareersBrand kitCopyright Â© 2025 CodeSandbox BV, a Together AI company.
