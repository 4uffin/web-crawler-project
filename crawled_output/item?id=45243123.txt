Private equity seems to be a form of cancer that slowly sucks the life out of everything it touches, with a single goal: to grow and spread. Can someone more knowledgeable please explain to me why I'm wrong?replynzeid 1 hour ago

The reason it's easy to conclude that they're evil is because they are almost never committed to preserving or improving the quality of their investees. They are only committed to making money, and that often comes in the form of price gouging and liquidation.replydgrin91 1 hour ago

(not my views, playing devils advocate)PE strives to make things more efficient from a capital point of view. Business foois making $X in profit, and the PE firm's analysis says the can make X+Y dollars with some changes. This is 'better' because now the capital usage is more efficient and more can be spent in other places - new products, new jobs, new businesses, returns to investors, etc. And of course returns to the PE firm.In principle an efficient economy is important on a macro scale - if all the business are stuck in how they were doing things 30 years ago then we would have reduced innovation and ultimately less jobs.In practice there is of course a lot of money that flows back into the PE boss's pockets and.... thats it.replyOutOfHere 1 hour ago

It trades robustness for efficiency. It makes the business/service altogether less robust, unable to withstand shocks, unable to survive the tests of time.replyfreetanga 2 hours ago

Have you seen “Other peoples money” with Danny de Vito? I felt it explains this cancer quite well, 35 years ago.replyrpjt 1 hour ago

Efficiency?replynine_k 1 hour ago
| root | parent | next [–]
The classic playbook includes making a lot of debt, and then leaving the lenders holding the bag when the company files for bankruptcy. It can only be considered efficient if con artistry is efficient, that is, efficient at taking the money from the hands of people who trust other people "too much".replydgrin91 1 hour ago

This is over simplistic and if everyone knew this is what happens when PE comes into play then no one would lend to PE-backed companies. Often times these debts can work out.replynzeid 2 hours ago

Goddamnit, I just moved everything to Namecheap to avoid more outages. Anyone have other recommendations in the event of the likely private equity rot?replyectospheno 2 hours ago

If all you care about is avoiding outages and price then it is hard to beat cloudflare.replytensor 1 hour ago

I've been using Gandi for years and recently have been consolidating things there. In the past I've used Google and still have some stuff and Namecheap too.Gandi is a little more expensive, but are consistently excellent. Especially now with their new UX and org support, it's super easy to manage domains from both corporate and personal accounts with one login.replyjsheard 1 hour ago

Gandi was also bought out by private equity a few years ago, as far as I know their service is still fine but they keep raising their prices without any rhyme or reason. They want $38 to renew a .com now, and despite those price hikes they also rugpulled users of their previously-included email service by turning it into a paid add-on.Look forward to Namecheap heading the same way in a few years!replytensor 1 hour ago

Good for Namecheap. They're still my default when I'm searching for new domains, even though I end up registering somewhere else (their bulk search is still best in class imo).I'm a bit surprised at their revenue numbers considering domain registration is pretty much a commodity at this point. I always assumed non-technical people would first go to a web host/email provider that lets them buy a domain vs. a domain registrar that also supports email and web hosting. Clearly I'd be wrong.replynine_k 1 hour ago

> surprised at their revenue numbersI suppose that web and email hosting, and "security services" constitute a large part of it. Domain registration is not necessarily even the biggest part.replykennywinker 2 hours ago

Are there guides on how to move domains from Namecheap to whoever the new recommended provider is?replyblahyawnblah 2 hours ago
| parent | next [–]
Typically you just need to unlock the domain, obtain an authorization code from your current registrar, and then initiate the transfer process with the new registrar.replydismalaf 1 hour ago

Ugh, all my domains are with Namecheap, since Google stopped dealing with domains and CloudFlare and GoDaddy seem more evil.
Also I appreciated Namecheap's support of Ukraine.Hopefully it's not too predatory and the owner just wanted to cash out some chips; some corps do okay under private equity (Suse for example) but lots get ripped to shreds...replygavinsyancey 1 hour ago

I advise people to use porkbun generally.
Personally I use and like EasyDNS, though their UI is a little quirky.replyDrewADesign 2 hours ago

Do you think they have an enshttifying strategy before hand? Or do you think they just get in there and McKinsey their way to a worse product on the fly?replytensor 1 hour ago
| root | parent [–]
It can be either, but in both cases the ultimate goals are the same: increase efficiency. So if they buy multiple domain registrars then they can share infrastructure and staff and become more efficient.Or, without merging companies they can simply change the goal from growth to efficiency and "make do with less" and then that naturally leads to enshitification.reply
