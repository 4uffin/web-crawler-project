"The Grand Finale" goes out not with a bang, but also not with a whimper, but rather a polite wave goodbye.
Rated: B-

Nathalie Atkinson
Globe and Mail
Returning director Simon Curtis still doesn’t solve the television pacing and plotting problem of making a two-hour fan film that doesn’t feel like episodes tacked together, but at least gives each of the extensive beloved cast an arc and some closure.

A great, big, comfy upholstered couch of a finale.

Susan Granger
SSG Syndicate
Witty writer Julian Fellowes has cleverly created and cast such fully realized, socially stratified characters that what occurs is completely credible and director Simon Curtis continues the bittersweet vibe - so the conclusion is elegant and endearing.
Rated: 8/10

FandomWire
The Grand Finale is more than a two-hour contained episode but instead a fun way to celebrate the past and future of the franchise.
Rated: 7/10

From the Front Row
For longtime fans of the series, it will serve as a charming, if slight, capper on the decades-spanning story.

If you're a fan of Downton Abbey, you won't be disappointed.
The movie felt like it was solely made to provide an appropriate ending to the story line. Nothing really more (or less) to it than that. All the characters were there, played by the original actors. Even with Dame Maggie passing last year, they wove that in the story line in the right way. If the point of making the movie was made to close out the story line and to give fans a last hurrah, than it was successful. That's really it.

Love the fan fare, the costumes and the characters.
I wish they could have a few more. I would like to see how Downton would handle WW2.

Sir Julian Fellows has wrapped things up quite keenly with a bow in this final installment of Downton.
What blew my mind the most was Lady Edith! And it was lovely to see Thomas finally happy!! I want to go again!!
