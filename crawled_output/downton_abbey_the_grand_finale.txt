"The Grand Finale" goes out not with a bang, but also not with a whimper, but rather a polite wave goodbye.
Rated: B-

Nathalie Atkinson
Globe and Mail
Returning director Simon Curtis still doesn’t solve the television pacing and plotting problem of making a two-hour fan film that doesn’t feel like episodes tacked together, but at least gives each of the extensive beloved cast an arc and some closure.

A great, big, comfy upholstered couch of a finale.

Mortal Cinema (Substack)
...this is a comfort-food platter for longtime devotees, like whatever the adult equivalent is of Chickie Nuggies and Choccy Milk served on a silver platter with Grey Poupon and a bouillon spoon.

Caution Spoilers
I can attest that you you don’t need to have seen any of the show’s 52 episodes to (a) work out who’s who and (b) thoroughly enjoy this whole ridiculous shebang. You could probably do it on the memes alone.
Rated: 3/5

Susan Granger
SSG Syndicate
Witty writer Julian Fellowes has cleverly created and cast such fully realized, socially stratified characters that what occurs is completely credible and director Simon Curtis continues the bittersweet vibe - so the conclusion is elegant and endearing.
Rated: 8/10

A long time fan
Writing and actor were good.
The quality of the film, (the stock used to film the movie) I did not like.
It was not clear or sharp as in other movies. Also, I did not care for the lighting. Interior scenes were dark. Otherwise Downton Abbey fans will appreciate one last movie.
