"The Grand Finale" goes out not with a bang, but also not with a whimper, but rather a polite wave goodbye.
Rated: B-

Nathalie Atkinson
Globe and Mail
Returning director Simon Curtis still doesn’t solve the television pacing and plotting problem of making a two-hour fan film that doesn’t feel like episodes tacked together, but at least gives each of the extensive beloved cast an arc and some closure.

A great, big, comfy upholstered couch of a finale.

Caution Spoilers
I can attest that you you don’t need to have seen any of the show’s 52 episodes to (a) work out who’s who and (b) thoroughly enjoy this whole ridiculous shebang. You could probably do it on the memes alone.
Rated: 3/5

Susan Granger
SSG Syndicate
Witty writer Julian Fellowes has cleverly created and cast such fully realized, socially stratified characters that what occurs is completely credible and director Simon Curtis continues the bittersweet vibe - so the conclusion is elegant and endearing.
Rated: 8/10

The Grand Finale is more than a two-hour contained episode but instead a fun way to celebrate the past and future of the franchise.

Downton Abbey: The Stakes Have Never Been Lower. Feels a bit tired weve seen all these plot points before. One wonders why they made this movie at all. Nevertheless, the film was pretty fun.
