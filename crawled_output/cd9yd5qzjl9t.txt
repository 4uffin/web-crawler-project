I think race-planning for the season is something that Matthew Hudson-Smith is going to have to look into.He opened so early back in April, didn't do that many races after that, and then expected himself to be in top form by September, which was always going to be difficult.He just looked a little bit rusty, it looked difficult for him out there.

Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone starts her campaign for 400m flat victory by cruising to an easy victory in heat three in 49.41 seconds.She's over a second quicker than Martina Weil of Chile in second, with Mercy Oketch of Kenya in third.

Matthew Hudson-Smith got out well. He looked good and in control but he just lacked energy and that fifth-gear which you need in the final part.I think it will be mentally quite challenging for him to go away now and come into the next round. He will be thinking about what he needs to do, what went wrong in the latter part of the race and how he can correct things in a really short amount of time.

Matthew Hudson-Smith chose not to stop in the mixed zone after his 400m heat, but he has spoken briefly to British Athletics after progressing as a non-automatic qualifier."It felt flat, and my hips are a bit iffy," said Olympic and world silver medallist Hudson-Smith. "I was running and I felt âoh no my hips donât feel goodâ. "I got through it, but it hurt man. "I donât know, I really donât know, I literally had nothing. Itâs weird."

Great Britain's Sam Reardon has been speaking to BBC Sport after his men's 400m heat: "That was tough. The atmosphere was just amazing when I walked out and I have so much family out here so it was very special seeing them as I came into the home straight."It was a good race I think, I've obviously had a tough year with lots of injuries - three hamstring tears - so to go out there and still be in with a chance of getting a semi-final spot makes me really happy."Lane eight is tough in the 400m. You have to run your own race really but I knew I could go out strong, reserve a bit on the back straight and then work the bend. It was just about trying to get as close as I could to them as possible. I hope it's enough, but you never know."Reardon's time turned out to be enough to qualify for the semi-finals as the fourth quickest non-automatic qualifier.Image source, Getty Images

Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone isn't going to get an easy tilt at the 400m title.Standing in her way is reigning Olympic and world champion Marileidy Paulino. Last summer, the 28-year-old became the first woman from the Dominican Republic to win an Olympic
gold medal in any sport, upgrading her silver from Tokyo with an Olympic record of 48.17. Paulino, who did not run competitively until the age of 19, has only faced McLaughlin-Levrone once, beating her in June 2023. Instead she has mostly been duelling it out with Salwa Eid Naser, who took silver in Paris last summer. That was the 27-year-old's first medal since she became the youngest ever
womenâs 400m world champion in 2019, after the Bahrain athlete served a drugs ban that saw her miss the Tokyo Olympics and 2022 World Championships. She beat Paulino in the
recent Diamond League Final in Zurich. Great Britain's Amber Anning became the first British woman to win an individual world indoor sprint title this March,
edging out American Alexis Holmes in Nanjing. She set a national record of 49.29 seconds while finishing fifth at the Paris Olympics but has not been in top
form this summer. Her last outing before Tokyo was encouraging though, setting a seasonâs best
of 49.75 for fifth place at the Diamond League Final in Zurich. She is joined in the field by team-mates Yemi Mary John and Victoria Ohuruogu.

It's amazing to think that someone who has been so dominant for so long hasn't won this World Championship title yet. It just hasn't gone Valarie Allman's way in either 2022 or 2023.She is the two-time Olympic champion so you know that she is here to finally take that crown this year.

Image source, Getty ImagesThe women's discus final is under way.Can Valarie Allman secure gold after bronze in 2022 and
silver in 2023?The American retained her Olympic title in Paris in dominant fashion with the best four
throws of the final. The 30-year-old has eight of the top 10 throws this year - including a remarkable 73.52m in April. No-one had thrown as far since 1989 and it moves
Allman to sixth on the world all-time list. Laulauga Tausaga shocked herself and many others in 2023 by
becoming the first American woman to win a discus world title. Her winning effort of 69.49m
was four metres further than sheâd ever thrown before. The pair qualified in third and fifth respectively in Saturday's qualifying, with Croatia's Sandra Elkasevic recording the best throw of 66.72m. Elkasevic has two golds in both the Olympics and the World Championships, won in a period between 2012 and 2017. She took bronze in Paris last year and has also won seven consecutive European titles going back to 2010.

A very nice run from Sam Reardon. I was watching him in marvel because he has only just come back from injury and he has been thrown into this kind of company.Reece Holder went out like a man possessed because he knew the quality of the people around him. He thought he would take the race to them all and see what happens. He did what was necessary and ended up with another season best.

That was very hard work for Matthew Hudson-Smith. He looked really out of sorts.Our expectations are through the roof for the Olympic silver medallist, but he looked very tired coming down that home straight. He just couldn't gain on people.While everybody else was charging, Hudson-Smith seemed like he was faltering a little bit. He went off so quickly, as he normally does, but there's always a lot on the line at a World Championships.
