Image source, Getty ImagesGreat Britain's Charlie Dobson has been speaking to BBC Sport after reaching the men's 400m semi-final: "I don't think it was my sharpest race but, at the end of the day, I secured a position in the top three. I saw I was in that position and just relaxed a bit down the home straight to save a bit in the tank for two days time."That 200m to 300m period is something that I've worked on a lot this season. I don't think I've actually got it right once yet in a race, but it's all for nothing in the semi-finals so we'll see what happens."I still feel like I'm learning, but unfortunately that's not an excuse here so I'll make sure to give it everything again in the semi-final."

Lots of the runners looked like they were in cruise-mode there. I must admit the race looked a lot slower than the final time that was given, which was 44.64.What played into Charlie Dobson's hands was the fact he had Jereem Richards, who is an experienced runner, on the outside. Dobson will have known that if he just tracked Richards all the way through, it would be enough.

We've had a short delay before the start of heat two of the men's 400m, as the judges try to sort themselves out with the high jump heats getting under way. Bit of multi-tasking going on.

The now full-time athlete is the second fastest 400m runner in the world this year, after setting a PB of 43.85 seconds.Commonwealth Games champion Muzala Samukonga won bronze at Paris 2024, becoming the the first Zambian in 28 years to win an Olympic medal in any sport. The 22-year-old is yet to hit top form this year, finishing outside the top three in six of his seven races in 2025.Zakithi Nene is the fasted 400m runner of 2025, winning by over a second in a meeting in Nairobi in May in 43.76 to place him 16th on the all-time list.33-year-old Kirani James has a full set of Olympic and World Championship medals, and was back-to-back global champion in 2011 and 2012. He's not in great form - James is only the 19th quickest 400m runner in 2025.

Great Britain's Jake Wightman has been speaking to BBC Sport after winning his men's 1500m heat: "I didn't really want to win my heat. I tried to go into this thinking that I would just get in the top three, but it was messy and I could hear the bodies falling so I just wanted to stay out of that."I knew that if I felt good, I could control the last 200m which I felt like I did. It felt really nice to be out there. It was exactly what I needed today."

Having overcome battles with mental health to get to this point - and he recently became a father - he'll be desperate to get his hands on the top prize.Dobson is the current British champion and earned a surprise win over Hudson-Smith at July's London Diamond League meet, while Reardon will hope to use the momentum of setting a new PB of 44.60 seconds.The top three from each heat will progress to the semi-finals, along with the six fastest non-automatic qualifiers.

Yesterday was a significant day for hosts Japan, who celebrated the return of a premier global sporting event to Tokyo with a medal in the opening men's 35km race walk.Four years after the Japanese capital hosted the postponed 2020 Olympics behind closed doors because of the coronavirus pandemic, the National Stadium's entrances were opened to fans for the start of the World Athletics Championships.Memories of the 2020 Games are scattered all around the stadium which was supposed to stage magical moments for Japan, including the Olympic cauldron.The president of Japan Athletics spoke about the opportunity for these World Championships to wipe away the mixed emotions felt back then and, on the evidence of last night's atmosphere and with another sold-out session to come, that flame feels like it has been reignited.

Dressed for the part and delivering a top class service, volunteers have been out and about helping fans keep cool by spraying mist as the heat and humidity remains pretty darn intense in Tokyo. There are plenty of options available to help spectators cope with the conditions outside the stadium, including this walkthrough cooling area which, let me tell you, was very refreshing. Momentarily, at least.Organisers have done what they can to help provide temporary relief from the temperatures, which have remained consistently around 30C and are only expected to increase over the coming days.It really is tough out there for the athletes. I'm not sure how else to explain it other than it feels like the air is just sticking to you.Thankfully the women's marathon played out without any major incidents this morning following the carnage we saw after the race walks on Saturday.
