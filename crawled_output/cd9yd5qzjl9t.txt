I would love to see Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce do this for one last time.Her legacy within this sport is incredible. She is one of the greatest-ever and I'm so happy to see her in the final, it is brilliant to see.

There was a lot of luck involved in that semi-final heat for Sha'Carri Richardson.She came out of her blocks, she got into her rhythm, she then just stumbled and her leg collapsed a little bit. She had a hell of a lot of work to do to bring that back, but she did it.She absolutely put on the burners to secure that qualification position, but she wouldn't have wanted to run it in that way. She will have to go away and make sure her start is bang on for the final.

That was good wasn't it! We knew this semi-final heat was going to be tight, but Melissa Jefferson-Wooden is just immense. Her season has been so strong.What I love about her is not just her consistency, because that's clear, but her metronome way of running. It's all about rhythm and timing for her. She runs effortlessly because it is just one thing after the other for her - get a good start, go to my transition, get into my knee lift and just maintain.Dina Asher-Smith will be very happy to see the 'Q' next to her name.

I know there is more in the tank," said Lyles."This is the best form I have ever been in my life. I am bringing special things here. Running 9.95 in the first round is exactly what I wanted to warm up my body."

Jeremiah Azu, Zharnel Hughes and Romell Glave are the British trio looking to reach the men's 100m final.Azu and Hughes progressed through Saturday's heats with little fuss, but Glave had to wait to find out if he would be one of the quickest non-automatic qualifiers after he finished his heat in fourth.Glave equalled his personal best of 10 seconds, and was quicker on the day than both of his compatriots.Azu lines up alongside Olympic champion Noah Lyles in heat one, as well as 2020 Olympic champion Lamont Marcell Jacobs.Hughes goes head-to-head with Lyles' arch-rival Kishane Thompson, who is favourite to take gold in Tokyo.In heat three, Glave must deal with Olympic 200m champion Letsile Tebogo and Oblique Seville, the second fastest man in history to never win a major individual medal.

Daryll Neita leaves the hot seat reserved for the current two fastest non-automatic finishers, to be replaced by British team-mate Amy Hunt. Sport can be cruel.That is gutting for Neita, having looked so good in the heats and been so determined here to claim her first global medal after going agonisingly close at Paris 2024.Now it is Hunt sat just down below the media seats here with her fingers crossed, hoping she can hang on to a place in the final.As for Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, well, the fact her name has been cheered as loudly as that of any Japanese athlete over the past two days tells its own story. And she might just be writing one last remarkable chapter here.

We got a taste of what's to come this evening in yesterday's 100m heats, and even that was enough to get the crowd very, very excited.Prepare yourselves, because over the next two hours we're going to have eight 100m races and crown two world 100m champions.Noah Lyles claimed he is in the form of his life as he looks to win a third consecutive global 100m title. The question is whether that will be enough, with Jamaican's Kishane Thompson and Oblique Seville among those hoping to dethrone him.Meanwhile, is the women's event a two-horse race between American Melissa Jefferson-Wooden and Julien Alfred? Opinions could very well change over the course of these semi-finals.

Great Britain's Yemi Mary John has been speaking to BBC Sport after her women's 400m heat: "The energy was incredible. I always love racing in championships like this, but this is my first individual so I'm just soaking it in and enjoying every moment of it. Hopefully I make it through to the semi-finals, I do think I ran hard in my heat so hopefully I'm through."In the outside lanes, you can't see anyone so you can't really assess where you are until almost the last 150 metres. It can definitely be harder being in one of the outside lanes, but it was just about focusing on my lane, focusing on my race and hopefully booking my ticket to the next round."I know how to run championships, but this is a whole new level. We've already seen some incredibly fast women and there's so much competition here, so I'm buzzing."
