Become a book author with Springer
“Springer Nature is always my first choice for publishing my books, as the full team is highly motivated and they motivate us to do something novel, out of the box, professionally relevant and well researched.” - Professor Shailendra K. Saxena, Book Author
Work with a publisher with the reach, reputation and relationship skills to guide you through your first (or fiftieth) book.
Whether you’re considering publishing a textbook in your field or have been asked to contribute to an essential handbook, our vision for your work is simple: create the highest quality publication and make it widely accessible in multiple formats so it is easily discovered, downloaded and cited. Our industry-leading open access options offer even more impact.
On average, a Springer eBook receives 8,800 downloads in the first year of publication and 40 citations during the first four years of publication.
Typically, our open access books receive 10 times more downloads, 2.4 times more citations and 10 times more online mentions compared to non-open access books.
Are you ready to write or edit a book or have you been invited to write a book or chapter? Our highly-skilled, global Publishing Editors—on the ground in areas where research is growing—guarantee quality and stewardship and value the author relationship above all else.
