About Us
Law
Software purchase, multilateral agreements and charges of corruption against officials – the scope of law application is broad. The relevant field of law and the source of law on a national or international level have to be identified in order to solve a given legal question. The Springer Law program maps all relevant fields, from both a scientific and a practical standpoint – and thus connects all the crucial dots for researchers, students and practitioners.
