Hank Thompson (Austin Butler) was a high-school baseball phenom who can't play anymore, but everything else is going okay. He's got a great girl (Zoë Kravitz), tends bar at a New York dive, and his favorite team is making an underdog run at the pennant. When his punk-rock neighbor Russ (Matt Smith) asks him to take care of his cat for a few days, Hank suddenly finds himself caught in the middle of a motley crew of threatening gangsters. They all want a piece of him; the problem is he has no idea why. As Hank attempts to evade their ever-tightening grip, he's got to use all his hustle to stay alive long enough to find out....

What to Know
Critics Consensus
A freewheeling throwback, Caught Stealing splendidly showcases Austin Butler's movie star charisma while marking a surprisingly lighthearted gearshift for director Darren Aronofsky.

Audience Says
A diverting, pulpy caper with ‘90s flair, Caught Stealing is a gritty, violent ride fueled by the charisma of Austin Butler and Zoë Kravitz.

This is a straightforward, entertaining crime thriller.

AARP Movies for Grownups
Caught Stealing is the best movie from Darren Aronofsky... in years, a crazy After Hours-style yarn with a high body count and a buoyant, breathless pace.
Rated: 4/5

It’s Aronofsky near his best.

Caught Stealing can be set present day or any other time in New York city's checkered history. Sure there's a talk of gentrification, Giuliani and Mets, but no one in the movie seems to be affected by them at all.

Less Hat, Moorhead
Caught Stealing is ultimately just standard mayhem from the Robert Rodriguez or Guy Ritchie playbook... Butler kept me rooting for him until the end, however. So did the cat.

The kind of movie I imagine a lot of film school students envisioned making after seeing "The Boondock Saints" and a couple of Guy Ritchie flicks.

Oof. All over the place, nonsensical and twists you can see from a mile away.
And the random baseball references are so obscure you know they relate to literally one person - the dude who wrote the book.
