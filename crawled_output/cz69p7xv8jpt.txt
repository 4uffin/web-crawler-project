Tyrrell Hatton is looking pretty serene as he wanders down the seventh hole, chatting to Sky Sports."I'm just trying to get myself opportunities on every hole - I've basically had a birdie putt for the first six holes but unfortunately only two have gone in so far," he laughs. "It's going fine. I have a moan and then by the next shot I';m getting really focused and know what I'm trying to do."I feel fairly good, somewhat comfortable with my swing. I'm just trying to keep hitting good golf shots. Hopefully some putts will drop."

Over on the sixth and Adrien Saddier finally has a look at a birdie but the Frenchman slides his effort past the hole.Tyrrell Hatton also has a presentable chance, from around 15 feet, but his ball stays on the green.Alex Noren scrambles well after being out of shape of the tee, two-putting for par from 35 feet.

I mean, wow. Majestic from Viktor Hovland whose view of the green is completely blocked by some of the giant trees that flank Wentworth.No bother, he flops it over the foliage and kills it dead, seven feet from the pin. Terrific.

A smile from Matt Fitzpatrick follows a chip-in birdie on the seventh and he moves alongside playing partner Ewen Ferguson, who narrowly misses doing similar from the greenside rough.Patrick Reed has a great chance to move a shot clear of them after knocking his approach to three feet. But that's an awful putt. Wow. Big miss. Par.

Aaron Rai's terrific start continues - a fourth birdie in his opening seven holes sees the Englishman move two off the lead.His latest is a four-footer after another pin-seeking wedge from 140 yards.

Hottest player out there right now? That's Kristoffer Reitan who rams home his fifth birdie of his opening eight holes and leaps to 14 under par.The 27-year-old has made almost 70 feet of putts so far today.Image source, Getty Images

Jon Rahm knows he's not given his lengthy birdie putt enough juice up at the 14th and is immediately up and after it.A shot picked up there would have been a bonus.He's four back with four to play but could set a target.

Another man joining the gaggle at 13 under par is Darren Fichardt as he tidies in a birdie on his sixth hole.Gutsy par save from Viktor Hovland too as he required 14 feet after that trouble off the tee.He'll stay at 12 under.

There had been high hopes that Ludvig Aberg may shine today but the Swede is having one of those rounds.He bounced back from a couple of early bogeys with successive birdies on the fourth and fifth but he immediately gave a shot back on the sixth. A par on the seventh and he's way off the pace.

A nice move from Marco Penge up ahead of the leaders as he sneaks up to 13 under par.Birdies at 10 and 11 mean the Englishman is within three with seven holes of his round to play.

Image source, Getty ImagesAlex Noren does about as well as you could expect to from 30 yards with no green to work with. He parachutes a high effort straight at the pin but there's no stop on the ball.And the 15-footer coming back for par is too tricky. Shot gone.Adrien Saddier shows some frustration as he leaves another chip short of the hole. But he once again tidies up for par.And finally, Tyrrell Hatton for birdie... in the heart of the hole. Lead cut to one.

If anyone was thinking Viktor Hovland was settling in for a normal round after his first par of the day at the fifth, then I've got news for you.He has blundered his tee shot waaay right off the sixth.More trouble for the Norwegian.

A comedy trampoline bounce off a footpath for Alex Noren's ball down the right of the par-three fifth hole.But it's no laughing matter for the Swede who cannot watch as his ball takes a huge bounce away from the green. His two-shot lead may be threatened here......Tyrrell Hatton, fresh off his down, up, down par on the last, fires in to about three feet. Saddier's scruffy start continues as his ball runs through the back of the green.

Jon Rahm perhaps in must-make mode after an untidy approach found the bunker at the 14th.He's ended up seeking par from 11 feet and no, he's given it too much turn.That is a real momentum checker for the Spaniard.

I must admit at no stage did it look like it was in. Because of the pace he hit it, it did a full 360 around the cup - and that's always hard to take.

A penny for your thoughts Tyrrell Hatton. His birdie putt horseshoes in and out the hole. The emotions are kept in check, just.Alex Noren leaked his approach to the fourth way out right but he played a delightful third to a fraction inside Hatton's ball and he learns from the putt to drain his birdie and he's suddenly two clear.That's because Adrien Saddier is also a little ragged and fails to hole a chip from just off the green for a four. Par for the Frenchman.

Delicate touch from Viktor Hovland out of the rough fringing the fifth green. He's judged it extremely well and will ensure he gets par.Disappointment for Harry Hall though as a bogey drops him back.

Two weeks running he's holed out at the 72nd with an eagle three.Obviously last week it meant more to get into that play-off at the Irish Open, but my word, he's Billy Box Office isn't he.There is never a dull moment.Always a story with Rory.

That will tell your Rory McIlroy has indeed found an eagle at the last with a giant putt from 35 feet - and maybe it's carried across the pond too.The Masters champion has been excellent today, shooting seven under and into the top 10.

Back to the fourth and the trials and tribulations of Tyrrell Hatton. The Englishman's ball didn't go out of bounds and he's advanced it back into the fairway with his second shot.He's having a chat with a rules official about his ball. Hatton is claiming his ball is cracked, after bouncing on a tarmac road and therefore he can change it. The rules official is having none of it, despite Hatton's protestations.So he gets back over his ball, 76 yards from the pin, and he spins one in to about six feet. Think the rules official might have been right Tyrrell!
