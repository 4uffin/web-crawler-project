Anyone who pars the fourth is losing ground today. Ewen Ferguson and Patrick Reed are both in for birdies, but Matt Fitzpatrick goes one better after firing a laser-guided iron into about three feet and knocking in the putt for an eagle-three.Heating up nicely.

A tasty run of birdies has fired Kristoffer Reitan of Norway into contention here.He's five holes in, already three under for the day and trying to force himself into the mix.

Jon Rahm! He opens his mouth in shock that his eagle putt at the 12th has lipped out. That looked nailed on.It would have put him at -14 and seriously in the mix.Still, -13 is only three shots back.

Adrien Saddier is first up on the third green and his effort, up and over a ridge but that's not troubling the hole. It's all a little bit of a scramble of a round so for for the Frenchman.Alex Noren perhaps learns a little from Saddier's putt and drains a first birdie putt of the day and Tyrrell Hatton, who has had the benefit of watching two putts, also knocks his into the hole.

There are so many people following Rory McIlroy. He won't win the tournament, but is definitely the leading attraction.He's putting from the fringe for eagle at the 17th, about 24 feet and it comes up a little short.A bounceback birdie though with one hole left.

The par-five fourth is playing the easiest hole on the course today. And it's not a huge surprise given it's playing under 500 yards and the pros are booming drives and leaving around 170-180 yards into the green.Aaron Rai is the latest to pick up a shot on a hole that is playing 0.86 shots under par on average.

One Englishman we've not mentioned yet is Darren Bradbury, who has shot a sublime 66 to race up the leaderboard.A bogey at the first and then seven birdies over the following 17 holes has vaulted him into the top 20.

Onto the third for our leaders, who are all in good shape off the tee and Alex Noren - who won last month's British Masters for his first title in seven years - fires his second from 175 yards into the heart of the green, pin-high, 20 feet away.Adrien Saddier leaks another right, but he too finds the green, about double the distance of Noren.Tyrrell Hatton goes for the pin and leaves himself a dozen feet for birdie.

So close to a 41-foot birdie for Harry Hall on that third green. He's taking a par, as it Darren Fichardt. No change to either of their scores today.Sadly for Viktor Hovland, he's dropped back again with a second bogey of his round.

A fifth birdie of the day drops on the 11th hole for Jon Rahm and the Spaniard is just three back and with seven holes remaining has plenty of time to set a testing clubhouse target.

Viktor Hovland's topsy-turvy start is continuing at the third after finding the wilderness off the tee.We join him as his ball lands in the heart of the green but he'll have 25 feet to save par.

Rory McIlroy's momentum has hit the brakes at the 16th as his approach flies over the back of the green.He can't get up and down for par and slips back to nine under for the tournament.Two par fives left on his round.

A trio of pars for Matt Fitzpatrick is a solid start but that won't be good enough if he fancies a crack at the title.Ewen Ferguson is showing him how to do it though. A pin-seeker on the third sets up a tap-in birdie. The Scot making strides.

The par-three second is only a yard over 150 but the pin is tucked away back left.Noren and Hatton find the dancefloor to set up birdie looks from inside a dozen feet.Saddier goes long and into the rough again. His chip out leaves a four-footer for par.Noren first up and his putt misses left. Hatton from closer in... misses right. Saddier drops his par putt. As you were gents.

Big par saver for Adrien Saddier on the first, knocking in a six-footer after a decent chip from the cabbage.You feel it's important for him to get off to a solid start given he led by one last week at the Irish Open, only to fall away with a 74 as Rory McIlroy took the win.Alex Noren and Tyrrell Hatton also in for more comfortable pars.

Chance for Viktor Hovland to balance the books?Done. Nice birdie from the Norwegian and he's back where he started.

That's more like it from Viktor Hovland.Wanting to erase that opening bogey, he's fired a dart at the second green and landed it nine feet from the pin.Can he re-find his putting touch?

I haven't got a clue who is going to win this.Is it going to be someone from behind posting a score? One from those top three players?You have to think one of the top three will shoot at worst level par, and probably one or two under.So is it a three-horse race? I'm not sure.

What odds an American spoiling the European party today? And what an American to do it... Patrick Reed knocks in his first birdie of the day on the second and he's now just four off the lead.No Reed at the Ryder Cup this year though.Matt Fitzpatrick and Ewen Ferguson both safely in for par.
