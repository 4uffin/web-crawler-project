Sensational from the Swede. He takes dead aim at the cup and rattles his putt from the back edge of the green. It smacks into the back of the cup and drops. Advantage Alex Noren.What has Adrien Saddier got? Oh my. What. A. Putt. The Frenchman responds by draining his 10-footer.Game. On.

The final tee shot of a unfulfilling weekend for Viktor Hovland is thumped plumb down the middle of the 18th fairway.Can Team Europe's Ryder Cup man finish with a flourish here? At the moment, he is out of the top 10.

It's a wedge-off on the 17th after Adrien Saddier and Alex Noren both take two to get with 100 yards or so of the green. And it's advantage to the Frenchman, who fires his dart much closer to the bullseye.But first up is Tyrrell Hatton with an 18-footer for birdie. Again he misses.

Up ahead on the green and Ludvig Aberg is knocking in a birdie putt to finish on 12 under. Successive birdies to finish will leave a sweet taste for the Swede who has not had his best stuff today.Aaron Rai, on the other hand, who had been in the mix for a Ryder Cup wildcard place, knocks in a short par putt. He finishes with two pars, when birdies were needed. Still, a good week for the Englishman who posts a bogey-free 66 and is the clubhouse leader should those coming up behind him falter.

Another look to the heavens from Darren Fichardt as his birdie putt at 17 seems destined for the hole but stays up.It's an exact reaction from Viktor Hovland too - eyes to the sky because his effort also stays out.Neither player can cash in on this par five.Onto the last.

Oof - is this going to be a reload for Ewen Ferguson on the 18th tee? He spends an age drying the face of his driver before unleashing a huge drive down the right but his ball is bending out way further and careers into the trees. Not a time to be going out of bounds.

Another player with a wry look on his face is Patrick Reed after he misses a short birdie putt on the 17th. The American really did need that to have any chance of posting the clubhouse target.He's joined on 15 under by Matt Fitzpatrick who follows his birdie on 16 with another on 17 and his demeanour is completely opposite to Reed's as he bounces off the green.Ewen Ferguson knocks in a par saver to remain the leader in this group. Big par-five finisher coming up.

It really is a matchplay situation on the 16th green. Alex Noren's putt is tracking nicely but misses to the left.Tyrrell Hatton slams his putter on the ground in frustration as his putt goes straight right off the bat. He knows his chances have all but gone.Will Adrien Saddier take advantage? No! His putt sidles by on the left. Par.

Adrien Saddier is first up on the 16th and puts the pressure on with a pin-high approach that leaves him around six feet for a birdie.Tyrrell Hatton follows him in, albeit just on the fringe of the green and 12 feet away.How are your nerves Alex Noren? Rock steady from the Swede who has won 11 times on the DP World Tour since 2009 - only one player has more... a certain Rory McIlroy, with 20. Noren's ball pulls up 15 feet from the hole and he'll have first putt...

The final group all find the fairway with their tee shots on the par-four 16th. In fact, you could throw a reasonably sized picnic rug over all their balls.A bit of a matchplay situation now, first up gets the chance to put some pressure on their opponent.

Good effort from Viktor Hovland up at 16 but perhaps as his lengthy birdie putt slides by so do any lingering hopes of him winning this,Four back with two holes to go seems pretty insurmountable at this stage.

Aaron Rai, is in short sleeves on the 17th green. The rain looks like it's eased. An outside chance of birdie from the back edge but he rattles his putt right. One to play for the man from Wolverhampton. Can he set a challenging target?He's playing with Ludvig Aberg and the Swede smashes in a birdie putt across the green. He gives a sheepish smile to the fans. Not been his day.

Up on the 16th green and Patrick Reed is surveying a 25-footer that will come in from the right. But he doesn't hit it wide enough. ParMatt Fitzpatrick gets another one to drop though and with two par-five holes to finish, he's still not 100% out of this.Big par saver for Ewen Ferguson coming up - what has he learned from Reed's putt? Absolutely everything is the answer. Great putt to stay right in this.

It's still a packed leaderboard but with the leaders reaching 18 under par, it's stretched a little.Like an accordion.

Adrien Saddier is finally ready to hit his second on the 15th. It's too big an ask to bend one round the trees onto the green, so he hits a low sawn-off chaser that scuttles up to the apron and leaves himself a chip up the green.Alex Noren has already played but he's half a club short from 209 yards, his ball nestling into greenside rough.Tyrrell Hatton finds the middle of the green. If he ever needed a birdie putt to drop...

An error by Ewen Ferguson off the side of the 16th green. He's only a few yards off the green and needs to be delicate but he thins his chip a little and it scuds past the hole, 10, 12, 15 feet... that could prove costly.

It's the person with the hood I feel sorry for.It's raining so heavily but because of where Saddier's ball landed, he can't put his hood up for shelter!

Adrien Saddier is chuckling when he finally finds his ball after an errant tee shot flies way right down the 15th. The fans don't seem to immediately know where it's gone, given everyone is sheltering under umbrellas.But one 'lucky' punter has managed to catch it in the hood of his jacket.That'll be a drop among the trees for the Frenchman but it could have been so much worse had his ball bounced because there's an out-of-bounds fence not far from there.

Lovely touch from Darren Fichardt to keep himself afloat at the 15th.He's clipped it out of the rough and should save par.Similar result for Viktor Hovland who found the bunker with his second shot but splashes out safely.
