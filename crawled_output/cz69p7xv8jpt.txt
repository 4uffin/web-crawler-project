Tyrrell Hatton with a mid-range birdie look on the 14th and yet another putt misses. It's just not going to be his day.Alex Noren up next with the par saver from 12 feet. Judges the weight to perfection as his ball dies in the right edge. Great par.But here's Adrien Saddier from about eight feet for birdie. A little fist bump from the Frenchman who is going nowhere.

Alex Noren is short with his tee shot on the short 14th, and his ball plugs in a greenside bunker. In fact, it's not just plugged, it almost disappears from view and it's under the lip. Ugly.But the Swede, who matched the course record with a 62 when he won this title in 2017, smashes his ball out of the sand and it plops onto the green.

Huge birdie putt for Ewen Ferguson on the 15th green. The sunglasses are staying in place, despite the gloomy conditions, and they are working for the Scot, who sinks a 20-footer for a fourth birdie in five holes.Matt Fitzpatrick, from half that distance lips out. The Englishman sinks to his knees. You've got to feel that's his race run.

Alex Noren was furthest away with his second to the 13th, so he's up first with the birdie putt. And the Swede slides his ball into the cup.What have his playing partners got? Adrien Saddier thinks he's followed him in, but his ball lips out. And then Tyrrell Hatton's does exactly the same. Daylight for Noren.

Darren Fichardt is inches from a timely birdie at the 14th as he watches his putt slide by.it's a better result for playing partner Viktor Hovland who takes his time before downing a second straight birdie, from five feet.Hovland hovering.

The Guardian's Ewan Murray, speaking to BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra: "Alex Noren has timed his run ever-so slightly too late to make Team Europe's Ryder Cup team."If Rasmus Hojgaard had not qualified automatically, Noren would have had a very strong chance to be going instead of him."And, as vice captain, i think he'll be taking his clubs. Just in case."

It is absolutely hosing it down at Wentworth. And we find Tyrrell Hatton in the middle of the 13th fairway, deep in conversation with his caddie, huddled under an umbrella.Just 158 yards to the pin. "Oh, pulled it, get lucky," he says as his ball flies over trees towards the left of the green. And oh boy, sometimes it pays to talk to your ball. It hops out of the thick stuff and then a bit of backspin takes hold and his ball rolls back towards the cup. Hatton can't see his ball so seems surprised by the cheers. He'll find himself with an eight-footer for birdie.Alex Noren and Adrien Saddier are both more than double that distance away.

What a birdie can do. Viktor Hovland has taken dead aim at the flag on the 14th and landed his tee shot inside seven feet.The Norwegian is injecting life into his round - he'll just hope it's not too late.

Oh one's gone in for Viktor.Great 24-foot putt up at the 13th - that's his 16th birdie of the week, but the first time his scorecard has moved since the fourth.That puts a little smile on his face.There's a fist-pump from Darren Fichardt too as he saves par in gutsy fashion.

Patrick Reed is on the 14th green stalking a left-to-righter, down the hill. About 12 feet. He doesn't borrow quite enough though and his ball drifts off to the right. Big birdie chance missed. Ewen Ferguson, from a similar distance, shows Reed how to do it, rattling his birdie try home. The Scot's race is far from run.Matt Fitzpatrick knocks in a two-putt par from 40 feet.

Aaron Rai, with his distinctive look of a black glove on both his hands, is in the middle of the 15th fairway and staring down the flag but he doesn't give his approach enough juice and he's in two-putt par territory.

A must-make putt for Tyrrell Hatton, especially with the other two making birdies.There was no way he could miss that one, for his mood and his momentum.It's definitely a birdie hole but the rain is really starting to come down. I think it's in for the rest of the day.

Aaron Rai's spell at the top of the leaderboard may well be short-lived because Alex Noren has just played a delightful chip onto the 12th green with his third shot and then Adrien Saddier confirms that by flicking a wedge from a bunker to about four centimetres.The Frenchman gets to 17 under.Will Noren join him? We'll have to wait until Tyrrell Hatton has tried his birdie attempt from about six feet. Tyrrell's putter has been lukewarm today but he gets that one to drop. A third of the day.Here's Noren from a foot or so, tidying up.
