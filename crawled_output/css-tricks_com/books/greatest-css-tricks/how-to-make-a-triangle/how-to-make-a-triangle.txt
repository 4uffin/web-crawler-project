Border Triangles
There are triangular unicode characters. You could draw a triangle in SVG. But there is another way to draw a triangle on the web, involving nothing but the border property and a little CSS trickery.
Imagine an element with a thick border:
.triangle {
width: 200px;
height: 200px;
border: 10px solid black;
}
Now imagine all four borders have different colors:
.triangle {
...
border-left-color:
red;
border-right-color:
yellowgreen;
border-top-color:
orange;
border-bottom-color:
rebeccapurple;
}
Notice how the borders meet each other at angles?
Look what happens when we collapse the element to zero width and height:
.triangle {
...
width: 0;
height: 0;
}
If three of those borders were transparent, we’d have a triangle!
.triangle {
...
border-left-color: transparent;
border-right-color: transparent;
border-top-color: transparent;
border-bottom-color: rebeccapurple;
}
Nice.
This could be useful on something like a pointing bubble of text. In that case, you could add the triangle to another element via a pseudo-element. Here’s a complete example:
