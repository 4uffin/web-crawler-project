Here the beloved Midwest condiment of pickled veggies in a punchy-hot brine does double duty: The vegetables get finely chopped and tossed with charred cabbage, lending pops of crunchy confetti throughout. And even more importantly, the brine gets transformed into a zesty vinaigrette that cloaks charred cabbage in a tangy, spicy sheen. Topped with sliced Italian sausage and plenty of basil, the giardiniera amps up an otherwise straightforward dish.When shopping for this recipe, make sure to grab Italian-style (vinegar-based) giardiniera, not Chicago-style. The latter is typically chopped much finer and includes oil, causing this dish to turn out a bit too slick.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleSee Related Recipes and Cooking TipsiconGalleryAll the Recipes From *Bon Appétit*’s Summer IssueWe’ve got sausage with cabbage and giardiniera, tomato aguachile, and matcha-berry frozen yogurt.ChevronChevronRead MorePork and Shrimp Cabbage RollsThink of these cabbage-wrapped beauties stuffed with a flavorful pork and shrimp filling as a hybrid between stuffed cabbage and dumplings.Chicken and Cabbage Stir-FryJuicy ground chicken and charred cabbage are the stars of this family-friendly meal.Stacked Muffuletta SaladThis towering salad—built with the components of a muffuletta sandwich like mortadella and an olive dressing—is ready for a party.Fet-Fisk’s Grilled Cabbage CaesarThe contrast of serving a grilled vegetable ice-cold is thrilling, and the Caesar dressing is rich and thick enough to cling longingly to each leaf of cabbage.Cabbage and Burrata Salad With Spicy TahiniThis dinner salad combines decadent burrata cheese with a spicy tahini dressing that clings to every crinkly leaf of Napa cabbage.Cod With Chorizo, Greens, and ChickpeasIn this one-pan dinner, flaky cod is finished in a chorizo-spiked sauce, alongside wilty greens and chickpeas—some tender, some crispy.Chicken Breakfast SausagesGive your favorite breakfast sausage a makeover with ground chicken.
