In the early 20th century, small Rust Belt cities like Utica and Rome were home to a large wave of immigrants who created new-age renditions of familiar dishes such as chicken riggies, Utica greens, and tomato pie in their homes and restaurants.Today the pasta is a comforting regional favorite for serving at everything from festivals to funerals in the upper stretch of New York State. The obsession is real: At the annual Riggies Run in Utica, runners are challenged to stop mid-race and scarf down a serving.This recipe sticks with a blend of fresh mini sweet peppers and jarred hot cherry peppers (look for jars labeled “hot cherry peppers” from brands like Cento, Mezzetta, B&G, or Jeff’s Garden; if sliced are unavailable, use whole and slice them yourself), but feel free to take after some upstate New Yorkers and add sautéed mushrooms or olives to the mix.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleRead MoreOne-Pot Buffalo Chicken PastaBuffalo chicken dip, but make it dinner.Vinegar Chicken With FigsA weeknight-friendly chicken dinner with two kinds of vinegar, dried figs, and a rich sauce.
