The only problem? A proper crisp takes about an hour to bake, and leaving the oven on during the dog days of summer is a hard pass. The solve? Making the crisp entirely on the stovetop so your air conditioner can get some much-needed rest.The trick to making this dessert an oven-free affair is to make a stovetop streusel. You just combine butter, flour, brown sugar, oats, cinnamon, salt, and vanilla, then—instead of baking them—you’ll fry them up in a skillet until crunchy. And for the filling, an array of any berries of your choosing can be tossed together. Blueberries, strawberries, and blackberries are ideal candidates, retaining their pristine shape as they cook down. Just avoid using raspberries, which have a tendency to turn to soup as soon as they hit the warm pan. And if you want to use frozen, just increase the amount of cornstarch to 2 tablespoons to account for their slightly more watery texture.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleSee Related Recipes and Cooking TipsiconGalleryAll the Recipes From *Bon Appétit*’s Sports IssueWe’ve got chocolate-date bran muffins, sheet-pan chicken souvlaki, and salmon with sizzle nut salsa.ChevronChevronRead MoreBlueberry Muffin Baked OatmealA nourishing, cozy breakfast you can throw together with fresh or frozen berries.Matcha-Berry Frozen YogurtFroyo for one, made in a blender and topped with a crackly magic shell.Grilled Pound Cake Sundae With RaspberriesThis is the perfect summer party dessert, featuring grilled pound cake, Cointreau-spiked raspberries, and classic vanilla ice cream.Neapolitan CakeInspired by Wayne Thiebaud’s iconic Cake Slice, these three distinct layers start with one simple batter.Dark Chocolate Flax BarkCrunchy, seedy flax crackers get topped with dark chocolate and a showering of sea salt for the ultimate sweet and salty snack.Matcha-Mango Chia PuddingFeaturing a bright layer of sweet mango, these colorful chia puddings are worth waking up early for.
