Brown butter, smoked paprika, and garlic create a sauce that makes a big impact with no extra ingredients. Its success is twofold: First, make sure to really brown your butter. You’ll know it’s ready when the sizzling has subsided and it smells deeply of toasted nuts. The second is to add your smoked paprika to the brown butter as soon as it’s done. Blooming the spices in fat helps to release and heighten their flavor.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleSee Related Recipes and Cooking TipsiconGalleryAll the Recipes From *Bon Appétit’s* Restaurants IssueWe’ve got vinegar chicken with figs, gnocchi piccata, and a corn cake.ChevronChevronRead MoreOur Favorite French Onion SoupCaramelized onions, melty Gruyère, and a deeply savory broth deliver the kind of comfort that doesn’t need improving.Kung Pao Cabbage With TofuReliable cabbage is cooked in the punchy sauce and then combined with store-bought baked tofu and roasted cashews for a salad that can also be eaten with rice.Béchamel SauceThis classic 15-minute sauce is your secret weapon for homemade mac and cheese, chowder, lasagna, and more.5-Minute Chocolate Mug CakeYes, it's a shortcut in a microwave.
