The Hugo spritz—a nimble union of prosecco, elderflower liqueur, fresh mint, and lime juice—is poised to take over your summer aperitivo. Perfect for enjoying poolside, alfresco, or simply helping you cool off, the effervescent low-ABV cocktail encapsulates the Italian word sprezzatura, a kind of effortless grace. Who wouldn’t want that after a day in the sun?A modern entrée to the spritz cocktail canon, the Hugo spritz cocktail recipe was created in 2005 and is often credited to bartender Roland Gruber in Northern Italy’s Dolomites. Rumor has it that Gruber’s original version used a syrup made from fresh mint leaves and lemon balm (locally known as melissa), but he soon switched to a ready-made Italian elderflower syrup. Today, most versions rely on elderflower liqueur (St-Germain is good and widely available), which is why you’ll also see the drink referred to as an elderflower spritz. The spirit imparts a honeyed, lightly floral flavor that’s far less bitter than an Aperol spritz or one made with Campari, making it a great option for any spritz skeptics in your life.For the finishing bubbles, use quality club soda or seltzer, and remember to slap each mint sprig in your palm to release its aroma before tucking it into the side of the glass with a lime slice.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleSee Related Recipes and Cooking TipsiconGalleryThe Most-Saved Recipes in the Epicurious App in JuneLike hummingbird cake and a steak salad with feta dressing.iconGalleryAll the Recipes From *Bon Appétit*’s Drinks IssueWe’ve got coffee cake scones, pad kra pao, and a frozen espresso martini.ChevronChevronRead MoreViolet Vodka SlushyCrème de violette is an exuberantly floral violet liqueur that gives vibrant color to this fun frozen cocktail.SaketiniA short list of ingredients comes together in this elegant sake martini.Paloma SlushyFrozen into a slushy, the classic tequila and grapefruit cocktail becomes even more refreshing.Bicycle BanditA riff on the Bicycle Thief cocktail, a citrusy, low ABV riff on a Negroni, this three-ingredient, party-ready twist features grapefruit soda.Dirty SpritzIn this nonalcoholic take on a spritz, which typically features a bitter liqueur with sparkling wine or fizzy water, the olive brine brings flavor and depth.Sea BreezeGourmet’s version of this perfect summer drink mixes the ideal ratio of vodka with cranberry and grapefruit juices, right in the glass.Rob RoyNamed for a Scottish revolutionary, a New York City operetta—or both—this effortless scotch cocktail is built to last.Sake-Grapefruit FizzThis light and drinkable cocktail pairs the bittersweet flavor of grapefruit with botanical gin and sparkling sake for a bubbly finish.Since 1995, Epicurious has been the ultimate food resource for the home cook, with daily kitchen tips, fun cooking videos, and, oh yeah, over 33,000 recipes.FacebookXPinterestYouTubeInstagramAbout UsThe Epicurious AppNewslettersSubscription FAQsGift GuidesCareersPress CenterAdvertisingMastheadUser AgreementPrivacy PolicyYour California Privacy RightsAccessibility HelpCondé Nast Store© 2025 Condé Nast.
