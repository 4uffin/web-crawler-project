This salad is for you. Instead of fighting it, this recipe celebrates it, flaking a fillet of salmon into large pieces and nestling them alongside an array of vegetables. The salmon, along with a cohort of endives, shallots, and beets, is simply dressed in lemon juice and olive oil and placed atop spicy horseradish yogurt. While you can certainly roast your own beets, using precooked, vacuum-sealed ones from the store makes this dinner a breeze to bring together. Look for them in the produce section next to the fresh juices and cut veggies.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleSee Related Recipes and Cooking TipsiconGalleryAll the Recipes From *Bon Appétit’s* Restaurants IssueWe’ve got vinegar chicken with figs, gnocchi piccata, and a corn cake.ChevronChevronRead MoreSoy-Glazed Salmon BowlsSaucy, soy-honey salmon—cut into cubes to speed up the cooking process—makes a savory topping for a quick weeknight bowl.Sheet-Pan Salmon With Rice Cakes and KimchiA comforting dinner of chewy rice cakes, punchy kimchi, bok choy, and perfectly flaky salmon made entirely on just one sheet pan.Sheet-Pan Pierogies and BeetsA flavorful one-pan meal featuring baked pierogies, roasted beets, and a poppy seed dressing.
