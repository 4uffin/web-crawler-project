While chili crisp is traditionally made with warming spices like star anise, cinnamon, and Sichuan peppercorns, this iteration is a summery, fresh take featuring jalapeños and scallions. The beauty of this green chili crisp is you can double the recipe (you’ll want to) for a condiment to use throughout the week. Top your fried eggs with it, serve it alongside flaky salmon, or mix it into some fried rice.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleRead MoreGreen Chutney ChickenCilantro and a handful of basic spices brings vibrant green color and rich flavor to broiled chicken thighs.
