Some trace its origins to the Savoy Cocktail Book (1930), where bartender Harry Craddock’s “Sea Breeze Cooler” mixed gin, apricot brandy, and grenadine. Others credit a midcentury Ocean Spray campaign, which helped popularize the version we know today.The classic Sea Breeze cocktail formula is simple and summery: vodka, grapefruit juice, and cranberry juice, served over ice in stemware or a highball glass, accompanied by a grapefruit wedge. It’s easy to make, easy to drink, and endlessly refreshing.This summer drink recipe is part of a family of easy vodka cocktails. A Bay Breeze swaps the grapefruit for pineapple juice, while a Cape Codder doubles down on cranberry and adds a lime wedge. A Greyhound is vodka plus grapefruit, hold the cran, and if you add on a salted rim, it becomes a Salty Dog.With minimal ingredients and zero fuss, the Sea Breeze remains a warm-weather favorite nearly 100 years after its debut.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleSee Related Recipes and Cooking TipsiconGalleryThe 17 Most Popular Drink Recipes of 2023Here are the fizzy, bitter, bright, and smoky drinks our readers made the most this year.iconGallery17 Grapefruit Cocktails for Those Who Like It Bitter and SweetThese grapefruit juice drinks are just the refreshment you’re looking for.iconGallery27 Simple 3-Ingredient Cocktails to Make Now and Memorize for LaterCocktails don’t need a million ingredients to be delicious.
