Chef Fátima Juárez has built a menu around heirloom corn nixtamalized and ground in-house. Her pan de elote recipe combines white heirloom corn and house-made rice flour, paying homage to her Jacona, Michoacán-born grandmother and the long, storied tradition of pan dulce in Mexico.Unlike American cornbread recipes, which rely on cornmeal, the batter here is made from puréed fresh sweet corn kernels (you can use yellow corn or white corn). In a pinch, you could use frozen corn, but anticipate a flatter, less nuanced taste. Avoid canned corn at all costs, as the kernels, even if drained, can cause the dessert to become waterlogged.Don’t worry if it sinks very slightly as it cools; the corn cream is a magical and unmissable accompaniment, sure to cover any flaws. It’s only lightly sweetened and amplifies the flavor of the cake while providing additional richness.Chef’s note: The custardy texture is essential to this cake, so err on the side of underbaking rather than overbaking it. Pull the cake from the oven when it’s golden on top and just set. Don’t worry if it sinks very slightly as it cools; the cream will cover any flaws.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleSee Related Recipes and Cooking TipsiconGalleryAll the Recipes From *Bon Appétit’s* Restaurants IssueWe’ve got vinegar chicken with figs, gnocchi piccata, and a corn cake.ChevronChevronRead MoreGrilled Summer Salad With Creamy Miso DressingA luxuriously creamy and bright dressing made with aquafaba, miso, and crunchy poppy seeds makes a star out of summer produce.Tomato AguachileJuicy peak-season tomatoes make the perfect plant-based swap for aguachile.Spicy Pork and Refried Bean SoupA can of refried beans disappears into the broth of this simple soup, adding body and luscious texture, while chipotle chiles in adobo add smoky heat.Smoky Orange Chicken ThighsChicken thighs cooked inside parchment packets alongside onions and oranges makes for a flavorful dinner that’s almost entirely hands off.Jalapeño Popper Skillet TacosRoasted poblanos, jalapeños, and red onion are coated with a melty sauce—warm with the flavors of pepper jack, and stabilized with a block of cream cheese.Neapolitan CakeInspired by Wayne Thiebaud’s iconic Cake Slice, these three distinct layers start with one simple batter.Ruffled Mushroom Pot PieTopping a classic mushroom pot pie with crunchy, scrunched-up phyllo takes the comfort food classic from good to great.Corn Furikake Fried RiceThe first thing you should make with sweet summer corn.Since 1995, Epicurious has been the ultimate food resource for the home cook, with daily kitchen tips, fun cooking videos, and, oh yeah, over 33,000 recipes.FacebookXPinterestYouTubeInstagramAbout UsThe Epicurious AppNewslettersSubscription FAQsGift GuidesCareersPress CenterAdvertisingMastheadUser AgreementPrivacy PolicyYour California Privacy RightsAccessibility HelpCondé Nast Store© 2025 Condé Nast.
