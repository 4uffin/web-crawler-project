But ground chicken is actually the perfect canvas, primed for taking on whatever flavors you throw at it. Here it is paired with a plethora of fresh mint, turning the meatballs into verdant beauties that are as vibrant as they are flavorful.Using a blender to blitz the mint, garlic, onions, and egg makes quick work of the prep, breaking down a bushel of hardworking ingredients in no time so you can cram the meatballs with as much flavor as possible. And to up the ante: Pairing the meatballs with a cooling yogurt sauce and scattering of cucumbers turns these emerald meatballs into a meal worth celebrating.Chef's Note: Make sure to use regular plain fine breadcrumbs, not panko, for this recipe. You need the fine texture to help absorb the excess liquid in the meatball mixture and bind them together. And don’t fret if your meatballs don’t turn out perfectly round. These meatballs will naturally slump on each side as they cook, but turning them often will help them retain their round shape.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleSee Related Recipes and Cooking TipsiconGalleryAll the Recipes From *Bon Appétit*’s Summer IssueWe’ve got sausage with cabbage and giardiniera, tomato aguachile, and matcha-berry frozen yogurt.ChevronChevronRead MoreAir-Fryer Chicken TikkaLacking an actual tandoor, the air fryer might be the best way to make chicken tikka.
