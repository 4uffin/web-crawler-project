MeekerArrowJump To RecipeSave StorySave this storyPrintThis sauce is slightly magical. The texture cloaks your pasta noodles much like a traditional meat sauce does, and the flavors are deep and rich, but the sauce is vegetarian…vegan, actually! The key to success is cooking the vegetables hot and fast, so they char but don’t fully cook and soften, which they will do once you’re simmering the whole sauce. The other important point is to chop the vegetables, after charring, finely enough that they resemble the ground meat in a meat sauce yet not so finely that they become a puree. I use a food processor, but you might have more control with a big ol’ chef’s knife and a cutting board.Inspired by a recipe from Food & Wine magazine, my version includes dried porcini (though it’s optional), which enhances the smoky-meaty flavors of the charred vegetables, and I crisp up a bunch of kale leaves and add them to the mix, which brings a pleasant, slightly bitter note to the otherwise sweet vegetables.Pappardelle rigate is a great noodle for this ragù, with its wide, slightly ridged surface. I also like bucatini for slurpability and rigatoni for when you want a short noodle, perhaps in a baked dish.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleRead MoreOur Favorite French Onion SoupCaramelized onions, melty Gruyère, and a deeply savory broth deliver the kind of comfort that doesn’t need improving.Simple Hot Cocoa for OneWith rich chocolate flavor and easy customization, this hot cocoa recipe is just the one you want to get you through winter.Béchamel SauceThis classic 15-minute sauce is your secret weapon for homemade mac and cheese, chowder, lasagna, and more.Dulce de LecheMake this versatile caramel at home with our slow-simmered method using milk and sugar—or take one of two sweetened condensed milk shortcuts.Moo Ping (Thai Grilled Pork Skewers)This version of pork skewers is made in the oven, which tastes just as good, but you could always throw these on the grill for a version closer to the original.Black Sesame Tofu “Basque” CheesecakeThere are many things that appeal about a Basque cheesecake—it's crustless (one less job) and is meant to look “rustic” with its wrinkled and jagged sides.Vinegar Chicken With FigsA weeknight-friendly chicken dinner with two kinds of vinegar, dried figs, and a rich sauce.
