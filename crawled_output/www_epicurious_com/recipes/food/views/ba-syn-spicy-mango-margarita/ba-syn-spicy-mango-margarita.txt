With just a few ingredients, this is the summer cocktail you’ll want to drink whenever warm weather is around.It starts with Tajín, a Mexican spice mix consisting of just three ingredients—chili peppers, lime, and sea salt. In lieu of the salt rim that accompanies the typical marg, we coated the rims of the glasses for this mango version in Tajín for added color and flavor. (For the rest of the bottle, it’s also great on a salad.)As for the drink itself, we recommend frozen mango chunks (but feel free to freeze some freshly chopped ripe mangoes if you have some on hand), good-quality blanco tequila, and Cointreau or another high-grade triple sec. After blending, give the mixture a taste; depending on your fruit, you may want to adjust the amount of sweetener.Pro tip: You can make this cocktail recipe up to 4 hours in advance. Stash the mixture in the freezer; when ready to serve, blend again until smooth.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleSee Related Recipes and Cooking TipsiconGalleryAll the Recipes From *Bon Appétit*’s Drinks IssueWe’ve got coffee cake scones, pad kra pao, and a frozen espresso martini.ChevronChevronRead MorePaloma SlushyFrozen into a slushy, the classic tequila and grapefruit cocktail becomes even more refreshing.Sea BreezeGourmet’s version of this perfect summer drink mixes the ideal ratio of vodka with cranberry and grapefruit juices, right in the glass.Violet Vodka SlushyCrème de violette is an exuberantly floral violet liqueur that gives vibrant color to this fun frozen cocktail.Hugo SpritzWith elderflower liqueur, mint, and prosecco, the effervescent Hugo spritz cocktail is a hit year round, but particularly on warm nights.Kimchi Bloody MaryThe kimchi brine is the secret hero here; just a splash of it brightens the cocktail while deepening it with a little funky je ne sais quoi.Bicycle BanditA riff on the Bicycle Thief cocktail, a citrusy, low ABV riff on a Negroni, this three-ingredient, party-ready twist features grapefruit soda.Rob RoyNamed for a Scottish revolutionary, a New York City operetta—or both—this effortless scotch cocktail is built to last.SaketiniA short list of ingredients comes together in this elegant sake martini.Since 1995, Epicurious has been the ultimate food resource for the home cook, with daily kitchen tips, fun cooking videos, and, oh yeah, over 33,000 recipes.FacebookXPinterestYouTubeInstagramAbout UsThe Epicurious AppNewslettersSubscription FAQsGift GuidesCareersPress CenterAdvertisingMastheadUser AgreementPrivacy PolicyYour California Privacy RightsAccessibility HelpCondé Nast Store© 2025 Condé Nast.
