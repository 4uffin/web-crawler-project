Here Sun Gold tomatoes lend their sweet juices and subtle orange hue to the cocktail. By simply smashing the tomatoes in a shaker along with a few basil leaves—not unlike muddling fruit into a cocktail—you infuse their ripe, vegetal flavor into gin—doubling down on the spirit’s complex floral character. That stirred (not shaken) mixture gets strained into a chilled glass so all you’re left with is the essence of tomato. It’s sweet, salty, savory, and ripe with summer flavor.While you can certainly use vodka in place of the gin here, using the latter gives this martini a stronger herbal flavor that brings out the best qualities of both the tomatoes and basil. A cheeky garnish of a cherry tomato threaded onto a cocktail pick gives the drink a touch of whimsy.This recipe is a part of Tomato Week 2025, a toast to summer's best produce.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleRead MoreSaketiniA short list of ingredients comes together in this elegant sake martini.Hugo SpritzWith elderflower liqueur, mint, and prosecco, the effervescent Hugo spritz cocktail is a hit year round, but particularly on warm nights.Rob RoyNamed for a Scottish revolutionary, a New York City operetta—or both—this effortless scotch cocktail is built to last.Sake-Grapefruit FizzThis light and drinkable cocktail pairs the bittersweet flavor of grapefruit with botanical gin and sparkling sake for a bubbly finish.Sea BreezeGourmet’s version of this perfect summer drink mixes the ideal ratio of vodka with cranberry and grapefruit juices, right in the glass.Bicycle BanditA riff on the Bicycle Thief cocktail, a citrusy, low ABV riff on a Negroni, this three-ingredient, party-ready twist features grapefruit soda.Frozen Espresso Martini With Spiked Whipped CreamThis frozen cocktail uses instant espresso for a strong flavor and unbeatable convenience.BeergaritaThe beergarita perfectly encapsulates laid-back summer sipping in a single pitcher, combining the familiarity of a margarita with the effervescence of beer.Since 1995, Epicurious has been the ultimate food resource for the home cook, with daily kitchen tips, fun cooking videos, and, oh yeah, over 33,000 recipes.FacebookXPinterestYouTubeInstagramAbout UsThe Epicurious AppNewslettersSubscription FAQsGift GuidesCareersPress CenterAdvertisingMastheadUser AgreementPrivacy PolicyYour California Privacy RightsAccessibility HelpCondé Nast Store© 2025 Condé Nast.
