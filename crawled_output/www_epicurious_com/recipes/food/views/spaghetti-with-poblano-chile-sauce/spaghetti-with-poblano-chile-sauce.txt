Slightly sweet with a bit of heat, roasted poblanos are blitzed with cream cheese, sour cream, and, if you can take the heat, some fresh jalapeños. This is one of Izzy’s favorite recipes, and I love to remind her that even if it’s a little too spicy, we must endure it, because we’re Mexican and love our spicy food! It’s fancy enough to serve to company and delight vegetarians.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleSee Related Recipes and Cooking Tips16 Standout Cookbooks for Summer 2025Here are the titles we’re keeping cracked in our own kitchens—recipes included.ChevronChevronRead MoreFrijoles de la Olla Ramen (Mexican Stewed Beans)Traditionally, this Mexican staple is simmered for hours in an olla, or clay pot.
