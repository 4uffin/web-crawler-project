Its origins lie in the use of excess meat from the commissaries of American military facilities in the Philippines, where Filipinos learned to be frugal and avoid food waste. In this plant-based version, using potato starch to coat the mushrooms is the key to achieving a super-crispy yet chewy texture. To experience sisig to its full effect, eat it over a bed of rice with a pint of cold beer or any fizzy beverage.I recommend using two skillets to save time while frying the mushrooms and tofu, but feel free to use just one skillet and reuse the frying oil. To get the full sizzling-plate experience, you can also make this sisig in a cast-iron skillet and serve it directly from the hot skillet. Place a wooden trivet under the skillet to protect your table and your hands.Amazon's Big Spring Sale is in fully swing—check out all the best kitchen deals now.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleSee Related Recipes and Cooking Tips16 Standout Cookbooks for Spring 2025Here are the titles our editors are cooking from at home—recipes included.ChevronChevronRead MoreCrispy Tofu With Scallion-Ginger SauceThe tofu is crunchy on the outside, in part thanks to a panko-studded exterior, and squishy-in-a-good-way on the inside.
