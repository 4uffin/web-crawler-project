Opt for short or tubular pasta shapes, such as shells, campanelle, or mini penne, over long noodles like linguine, fettuccine, or tagliatelle. You want lots of nooks and crannies to trap the cream sauce and give each bite rich flavor.Save your lox and cold-smoked salmon for bagels; you want the firmer, flakier texture of hot-smoked salmon here. For easy cleanup, you’ll boil the pasta first, then build the sauce in the same pot. But, if you just can’t wait, go ahead and cook the shallot, capers, and cream in a large skillet while the pasta cooks, then transfer the mixture to the drained pasta (remember to reserve some pasta water) to combine. Finish the creamy sauce with lemon zest and juice for bright flavor—just be sure to reserve the lemon juice until the dish is off the heat to keep its vibrancy. If you’re not into dill, any soft herb can take its place; try basil, chives, or tarragon. Pair this creamy pasta with a dry white wine or crisp seltzer.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleSee Related Recipes and Cooking TipsiconGallery47 Fall Dinner Ideas You’ll Crave All SeasonRecipes for back-to-school, sweater weather, and more.ChevronChevronRead MoreShrimp Scampi PastaWith lightning-quick shrimp and an easy garlic butter sauce, this crowd-pleasing pasta builds flavor fast.Cilantro Pesto PastaThis vibrant cilantro pesto recipe blends blanched herbs, Cotija cheese, garlic, and toasted pepitas.
