Fill your totes with heirlooms and pack your pockets with Sun Golds: Each day, we’re sharing a brand new, extra-delicious way to make the most of this fleeting season.Imagine the tender, flavorful filling of a pork dumpling—seasoned with soy sauce and brightened with a combination of ginger, garlic, and scallion. Now imagine that instead of a typical dumpling wrapper, it’s stuffed inside a juicy tomato, meant to be eaten with a fork and knife alongside a mound of rice. Cute and a little silly, it’s a fun way to use up an excess of summer tomatoes in a surprising and filling way, even straight from the baking dish.This recipe calls for 8–10 slicer (or beefsteak) tomatoes because they can really vary in size. You’ll want all of the tomatoes full nearly to the top with your seasoned pork mixture; if your tomatoes are on the larger end, you may only have enough pork to stuff 8 in total.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleSee Related Recipes and Cooking TipsiconGalleryAll the Recipes From *Bon Appétit*’s Summer IssueWe’ve got sausage with cabbage and giardiniera, tomato aguachile, and matcha-berry frozen yogurt.ChevronChevronRead MoreQuick Butter-Braised Tomatoes and DumplingsStore-bought dumplings, fresh tomatoes, butter, and soy sauce simmer away for dinner in a flash.Pad Kra PaoThis fast stir-fry dish pairs minced pork and fragrant basil with hot Thai chiles and a crispy fried egg.Pork and Tomatillo UdonTwo pantry sauces—hoisin and green tomatillo salsa—join forces to form a deliciously balanced sauce for udon noodles.Steak With Cherry Tomato ChutneyA steak dinner that’s more about the sauce than the meat.Sheet-Pan Salmon With Rice Cakes and KimchiA comforting dinner of chewy rice cakes, punchy kimchi, bok choy, and perfectly flaky salmon made entirely on just one sheet pan.Soy-Glazed Salmon BowlsSaucy, soy-honey salmon—cut into cubes to speed up the cooking process—makes a savory topping for a quick weeknight bowl.Five-Spice Beef Noodle SoupInspired by the flavors of Vietnamese pho, this ground beef and rice noodle soup comes together in just 20 minutes.Spicy Pork and Refried Bean SoupA can of refried beans disappears into the broth of this simple soup, adding body and luscious texture, while chipotle chiles in adobo add smoky heat.Since 1995, Epicurious has been the ultimate food resource for the home cook, with daily kitchen tips, fun cooking videos, and, oh yeah, over 33,000 recipes.FacebookXPinterestYouTubeInstagramAbout UsThe Epicurious AppNewslettersSubscription FAQsGift GuidesCareersPress CenterAdvertisingMastheadUser AgreementPrivacy PolicyYour California Privacy RightsAccessibility HelpCondé Nast Store© 2025 Condé Nast.
