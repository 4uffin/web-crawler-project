Ful medames is commonly enjoyed as a hearty breakfast or a satisfying meal throughout the day. Using lentils here, instead of fava beans, makes the dish much lighter and more accessible, as canned lentils are a staple pantry item in many kitchens.While the base ingredient changes, both versions are still prepared the same way, but garlic and chile are what really make the dish, while hearty cumin, fresh cilantro, tomato, and tahini pile on layers of flavors.
