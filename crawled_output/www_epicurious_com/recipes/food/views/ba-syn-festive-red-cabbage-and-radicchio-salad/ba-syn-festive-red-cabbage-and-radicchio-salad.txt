This moody-colored mix of cold-weather stalwarts, like radicchio, cabbage, red onion, and citrus, is equal parts juicy, fresh, and festive. Cara Cara, Valencia, or standard navel oranges will work in a pinch. Look for a smaller, more-tender head of cabbage for this salad, and don’t skip the massaging step—you want to retain some crunch, but not overwhelm with too much thick roughage.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleSee Related Recipes and Cooking TipsiconGalleryRecipes From Bon Appétit’s November 2024 IssueWe’ve got new and old Thanksgiving hits, pantry dinners, and retro-chic desserts.ChevronChevronRead MoreHappy Fridge SaladThe citrus juice and sherry vinegar in the dressing work hard to tenderize the hearty kale and crunchy broccoli slaw as they sit in the fridge.Cabbage and Burrata Salad With Spicy TahiniThis dinner salad combines decadent burrata cheese with a spicy tahini dressing that clings to every crinkly leaf of Napa cabbage.Winter Greens With Anchovy BreadcrumbsA mix of leafy greens turns extremely tender with the simplest treatment.
