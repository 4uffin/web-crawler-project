All it takes is hot oil in a Dutch oven and a tall drinking glass. The latter is key to thoroughly coating each dog in the cornmeal batter without making a mess of your countertops. Use standard-size turkey, pork, or beef hot dogs. Longer sausages can be challenging to maneuver in the corn dog batter and fry pot, and thicker cuts may cook unevenly. For structural stability during and after frying, slide the wooden skewers about three quarters of the way into each hot dog.If you enjoy smokier flavors, you can grill the dogs before dredging them. Either way, be sure to dry their surfaces first so the batter sticks.Oil temperature is crucial for deep-frying, so use an instant-read thermometer to ensure it remains at 350°F. Fry in batches and avoid using tongs, as they can damage the cornbread coating. Instead, turn the dogs with a slotted spoon or spider. Allow the crispy-hot corn dogs to rest on paper-towel-lined plates just until cool enough to eat. Serve with mustard, ketchup (if that’s your thing), relish, and your other favorite condiments. A root beer float on the side is nonnegotiable.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleSee Related Recipes and Cooking TipsiconGallery41 Low-Fuss Recipes for Labor Day WeekendPeel-and-eat shrimp, corn on the cob with basil butter, three-ingredient peach floats, and more.iconGalleryOur 35 Best Hot Dogs and SausagesDouble-stuffed dogs, grilled kielbasa tacos, low-country boils, and more ways to enjoy sausage this summer.iconGalleryGrand Slam Foods for a Baseball GameMake me some peanuts and Cracker Jack.iconGalleryHow to Eat Like a KidWhether you're planning for picky eaters or are just feeling nostalgic, these foods do the trick. iconGalleryFood on SticksFrom s'mores to kebabs, food's better when it's on a stick.ChevronChevronRead MoreSlow-Smoked ChickenAn espresso-and-cumin-spiked rub (or brine) gives this smoked chicken impressive flavor.Beer-Battered Onion RingsEasy to make, impossible to stop eating.Spice-Grilled Pork ChopsA pinch of sugar in the spice rub ensures picture-perfect grill marks with layers of flavor.Chicken CroquettesRather than breaded and fried as you might expect croquettes to be, these are something more akin to a seared chicken salad patty.Jammy Grape GaletteWe don’t bake with grapes as often as we should.
