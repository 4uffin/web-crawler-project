Keep your gin, sake, and sparkling water in the fridge until you’re ready to assemble and serve. We like using SummerFall sake because of its high levels of carbonation and light drinkability; if your sake is more on the sweet, syrupy end of the spectrum, you might want to add a touch more sparkling water to balance it out.While cocktails that contain simple syrup are often shaken, we found that the process diluted the delicate gin and citrus flavors too much; a quick stir is enough to homogenize your base before adding the fizzy elements. To make a big batch of these drinks, combine the grapefruit, lemon, simple syrup, and gin up to three hours in advance, then divide over ice and top with the sake and seltzer to serve.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleSee Related Recipes and Cooking TipsiconGalleryAll the Recipes From Bon Appétit’s Travel IssueWe’ve got honey-soy chicken, asparagus Comté salad, and a grapefruit cocktail.ChevronChevronRead MoreBicycle BanditA riff on the Bicycle Thief cocktail, a citrusy, low ABV riff on a Negroni, this three-ingredient, party-ready twist features grapefruit soda.Sea BreezeGourmet’s version of this perfect summer drink mixes the ideal ratio of vodka with cranberry and grapefruit juices, right in the glass.SaketiniA short list of ingredients comes together in this elegant sake martini.BeergaritaThe beergarita perfectly encapsulates laid-back summer sipping in a single pitcher, combining the familiarity of a margarita with the effervescence of beer.Rob RoyNamed for a Scottish revolutionary, a New York City operetta—or both—this effortless scotch cocktail is built to last.Paloma SlushyFrozen into a slushy, the classic tequila and grapefruit cocktail becomes even more refreshing.Brown DerbyThis simple honey-grapefruit cocktail dates to Prohibition, though its origin is a matter of some debate.BA’s Best Old-FashionedA classic drink that never goes out of style.
