With origins in Jamaica, the first American version of the recipe was believed to be published in Southern Living magazine. The cake would go on to become the magazine’s most-requested recipe of all time. While bananas, pineapple, and pecans and cream cheese frosting are considered nonnegotiable in this iconic cake, the jury is still out on whether or not coconut is a compulsory addition (we decided it wasn’t).Where most hummingbird cakes include the pineapple (almost always crushed and from a can) in the cake batter, in this recipe it’s isolated and turned into a jam that’s layered throughout. Approached this way, the cake layers are moist but not sodden, gummy, or weighed down by the liquid from the pineapple, a common affliction in hummingbird cakes. Cooking down the pineapple with sugar and lime concentrates the flavor and introduces a welcome hit of acid, particularly refreshing against the cream cheese frosting. Speaking of, the frosting is more cream-cheese-flavored whipped cream than traditional frosting. It’s light and airy and stays that way even after a multiday stint in the fridge.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleSee Related Recipes and Cooking TipsiconGalleryThe Most-Saved Recipes in the Epicurious App in JuneLike hummingbird cake and a steak salad with feta dressing.ChevronChevronRead MoreNeapolitan CakeInspired by Wayne Thiebaud’s iconic Cake Slice, these three distinct layers start with one simple batter.Passion Fruit Olive Oil CakeA plush olive oil cake swirled with tangy passion fruit curd.Pistachio Bundt CakePredestined to be the star of your next weekend hang or holiday brunch.Diner-Style Apple Pie With Lattice CrustCut this easy-to-handle dough (thanks, cream cheese) into wide strips for a fast-forming lattice that stuns.Tiramisu Basque CheesecakeTwo of our all-time favorite desserts, now in one new classic.Chocolate Olive Oil CakeFruity olive oil means this fudgy cake will stay moist for days.Flourless Chocolate-Orange CakeParty-ready and delightfully simple, this fudgy cake will become your go-to hosting dessert.Banana Pudding Paris-BrestThis modern riff on an old-school French classic is the ultimate fancy-pants dessert.Since 1995, Epicurious has been the ultimate food resource for the home cook, with daily kitchen tips, fun cooking videos, and, oh yeah, over 33,000 recipes.FacebookXPinterestYouTubeInstagramAbout UsThe Epicurious AppNewslettersSubscription FAQsGift GuidesCareersPress CenterAdvertisingMastheadUser AgreementPrivacy PolicyYour California Privacy RightsAccessibility HelpCondé Nast Store© 2025 Condé Nast.
