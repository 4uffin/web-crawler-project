Aided by some well-chosen spices, the flavor of this baked tofu makes it good enough to eat on its own. Make a double batch so you have some on hand through the week—the final baked tofu takes well to being simmered in a sauce, scattered over a salad, or stir-fried with vegetables.All products featured on Epicurious are independently selected by our editors.
