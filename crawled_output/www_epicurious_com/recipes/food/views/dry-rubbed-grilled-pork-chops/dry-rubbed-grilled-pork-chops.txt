You’ll want it to flavor chicken thighs, pork tenderloins, burgers, and more juicy, thick center-cut pork chops down the line. The secret is a smidgen of sugar. Just a dash of that sweet powder helps develop a crackly crust and ensures caramelization, with layers of flavor backed by chili powder, paprika, and garlic and onion powders. (And yeah, it works with brown sugar too.)The longer you let the chops marinate in the rub, the better they’ll be. As the sugar and salt dissolve, they’ll travel to the center of the meat, taking all that flavor with them. Just remember: Excess moisture is the enemy of crispy edges. Pat each side of the pork chops with paper towels before applying the spices and again right before cooking. Give the seasoned chops at least 20 minutes to come to room temperature before cooking (use the time to heat the grill). And let the cooked pork chops rest for at least 5 minutes before slicing, so their juices have time to settle.If it’s cold or raining, or your home isn’t blessed with a charcoal or gas grill, you can adapt this recipe for the indoors. Preheat a cast-iron skillet or grill pan over medium-high heat and add a slick of vegetable oil to the the pan. Sear the bone-in chops, making sure not to crowd the pan, flipping them occasionally until the internal temperature reaches 145°F on an instant-read thermometer for medium (or up to 160°F for well-done). Leftovers will keep in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 4 days.This recipe was adapted for style from ‘The Big Book of Outdoor Cooking & Entertaining’ by Cheryl and Bill Jamison.
