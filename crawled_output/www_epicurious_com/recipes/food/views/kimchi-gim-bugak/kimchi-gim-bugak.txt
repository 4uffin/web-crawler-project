It’s usually prepared by deep-frying dried vegetables or seaweed coated in chapssalpul 찹쌀풀 (glutinous rice paste), but I’ve deployed an easier technique here by leveraging rice paper. Thin sheets of kimchi add an extra spicy savory layer.VARIATION: USE KIMCHI SEASONING! Seoul Sisters, a sisters-owned brand based in Korea, makes a delicious kimchi seasoning for an even easier version of this kimchi bugak. Assemble everything as directed, but skip the kimchi. After you lay down the rice paper sheets, sprinkle with 2 Tbsp. kimchi seasoning, then the sesame seeds. Dry for 1 to 2 hours, then fry.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleSee Related Recipes and Cooking Tips16 Standout Cookbooks for Summer 2025Here are the titles we’re keeping cracked in our own kitchens—recipes included.ChevronChevronRead MoreMaple TamagoyakiFrom author Sonoko Sakai, this Japanese omelet is distinguished by its fluffy layers, with a touch of sweetness from maple syrup.Okonomiyaki Tater TotsCrispy tots topped with savory-sweet sauce, mayonnaise, furikake, scallion, and katsuobushi.Hong Kong Egg Scramble“Soft and pillowy, custardy and light—they were unlike any other scrambled eggs I had experienced before.”Rotisserie Chicken CongeeLeftover rotisserie chicken finds new purpose in this endlessly comforting dish.Ta’ameya (Fava Bean Fritters)Serve these as you would falafel: in a pita, on top of a salad, or as a snack with a dip.Bánh Mì Khong (Bánh Mì Bread)Making your own crusty loaves is surprisingly easy.Mapo Tofu SaladThe pan-fried tofu is crispy yet pillowy, served with a punchy dressing that is made with the same bold flavors as mapo seasoning.XO SauceDeveloped in the 1980s by a chef in Hong Kong, this sauce is all about umami.Since 1995, Epicurious has been the ultimate food resource for the home cook, with daily kitchen tips, fun cooking videos, and, oh yeah, over 33,000 recipes.FacebookXPinterestYouTubeInstagramAbout UsThe Epicurious AppNewslettersSubscription FAQsGift GuidesCareersPress CenterAdvertisingMastheadUser AgreementPrivacy PolicyYour California Privacy RightsAccessibility HelpCondé Nast Store© 2025 Condé Nast.
