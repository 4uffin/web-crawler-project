The trick is to fully cook your sugar. Allowing it to properly caramelize is what gives the stew its complex flavor, so be patient and allow it to deepen in color before adding your sauce. This process might feel scary, but fearlessness will be rewarded with a richer flavor. Dropping the tofu directly in the sauce and allowing it to gently simmer in the flavorful hot tub transforms them into flavorful cubes perfect for serving over warm rice. Topped with fresh herbs and chile, the tofu strikes the perfect balance of flavors with just enough heat.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleSee Related Recipes and Cooking TipsiconGalleryAll the Recipes From *Bon Appétit’s* Restaurants IssueWe’ve got vinegar chicken with figs, gnocchi piccata, and a corn cake.ChevronChevronRead MoreSilken Tofu With Black Bean Garlic SauceA homemade black bean sauce is better than anything you can find in the grocery store.
