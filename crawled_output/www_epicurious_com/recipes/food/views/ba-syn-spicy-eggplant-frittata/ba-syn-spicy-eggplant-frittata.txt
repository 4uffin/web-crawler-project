Look for long Japanese or Chinese eggplants for this frittata. They cook quickly, going from firm to custardy in minutes without a hint of bitterness. Their mild flavor counterbalances the sharp red onion and biting chile. Include the stems on the cilantro; much of the flavor is concentrated there. For a truly luxurious frittata, use half-and-half in place of milk.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleSee Related Recipes and Cooking TipsiconGalleryAll the Recipes From *Bon Appétit*’s Summer IssueWe’ve got sausage with cabbage and giardiniera, tomato aguachile, and matcha-berry frozen yogurt.ChevronChevronRead MoreTurkish-Style Eggs and TomatoesThis riff on çılbır marries garlicky yogurt, fried eggs, and spiced butter with summer tomatoes.Scallion-Speckled RiceScallion-infused oil, or pa gireum in Korean, is a fragrant way to upgrade a pot of rice.Jalapeño Popper Skillet TacosRoasted poblanos, jalapeños, and red onion are coated with a melty sauce—warm with the flavors of pepper jack, and stabilized with a block of cream cheese.Silken Tofu With Black Bean Garlic SauceA homemade black bean sauce is better than anything you can find in the grocery store.
