Honeycrisp apples are juicy, bright in flavor, and hold their shape beautifully, even after a long bake, making them one of the best apples for pie. All they need is a little butter, lemon zest, and cinnamon to bring out their very best.The stovetop pie filling can be made up to two days ahead or frozen for longer. (Line a pie dish with plastic wrap, freeze the apple filling, and then pop it out and triple-wrap it in more plastic. When you’re ready, drop it straight into your crust and bake.)Don’t be tempted to swap out the pie dough here for Our Favorite Pie Crust recipe. Unlike a double-crust pie, a lattice crust lets moisture evaporate, concentrating the filling and preventing a soggy bottom. The cream cheese in this dough keeps it tender and easy to handle while you roll and weave the lattice top. For clean, even strips, use a pizza cutter or sharp knife and aim for wide bands—they’re simpler to work with and, as developer Shilpa Uskokovic notes, far less fussy than spindly lattice. No need for an egg wash here; just brush the top crust with a bit of water and sprinkle on some granulated sugar for an extra-flaky pie crust that sparkles.Dollop the top of the pie with homemade whipped cream or a scoop of vanilla ice cream and pair each slice with a mug of black coffee for the authentic diner experience.All products featured on Epicurious are independently selected by our editors.
