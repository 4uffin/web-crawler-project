This easy mango bread recipe is adapted from her maternal grandmother’s neighbor, Mrs. Furusho. As neighbors, they shared a flowering hedge and a fondness for fresh mangoes, of which there are plenty in Hawai‘i. Think of mango bread as the island cousin to banana bread, with the same tender, moist crumb of the familiar quick bread, but golden on the inside, and with a bright, floral perfume.Mango season is fleeting, and proper mango bread is made with ultra-ripe fruit that is almost too soft. Some of the juiciest, sweetest mangoes in Hawai‘i are the highly coveted silky and virtually fiberless Pirie variety. For nonlocals, frozen mango is a reliable substitute—and a good way to make sweet mango bread year-round, but if you have a bevy of ripe mangoes, feel free to use them here.While Maii prefers her mango bread without any add-ins, the addition of toasted chopped walnuts or pecans, shredded coconut, or raisins would be perfectly natural. Regular white sugar best preserves the sunny hue of this delicious mango bread, but you could swap in an equal amount of light brown sugar for a more caramelly sweetness. If you love mango in any form, do yourself a favor and make this one immediately.Head this way for more of our favorite mango recipes →Recipe notesBack to topTriangleSee Related Recipes and Cooking TipsiconGalleryAll the Recipes From *Bon Appétit*’s Summer IssueWe’ve got sausage with cabbage and giardiniera, tomato aguachile, and matcha-berry frozen yogurt.ChevronChevronRead MorePineapple PieWith a crisp crust and fruity filling, pineapple pie is a Philippine bakeshop specialty.Sour Cherry and Campari GaletteThis Campari-spiked galette features the herbal aperitif, tart cherries, and floral citrus zest and is perfect for those who prefer bitter to sweet.Bánh Mì Khong (Bánh Mì Bread)Making your own crusty loaves is surprisingly easy.Matcha-Mango Chia PuddingFeaturing a bright layer of sweet mango, these colorful chia puddings are worth waking up early for.
