And while she acknowledges that she isn’t as fanatical as she once was (“Sometimes I make baba ganoush in January!”), that impulse is still foundational to her cooking. “One of the things that will never leave my body is the way you get to look forward to something returning every year, and that it feels like this reintroduction,” she reflects. This grilled salad, a tumble of the best ingredients that high summer has to offer, is one she makes every year, and is also one of the first things she cooked outside the restaurant that really felt like her own creation. “There’s a pleasure in remembering how good it all tastes again,” she smiles.And while peak season vegetables are the star of the show here, the luxuriously creamy dressing deserves its own shoutout. It uses aquafaba, the viscous liquid from a can of chickpeas (or any other canned white bean), to create a rich emulsion that will remain thick and stable for several days in the fridge. Savory with miso, tart with lemon, and with the fun crunch of poppy seeds, it can make a great salad out of just about any vegetable (just ask a plain bowl of lettuce).Recipe notesBack to topTriangleRead MoreGreen Beans With Tahini SbagliatoAn accidental recipe (sbagliatio means mistaken in Italian) yields a delicious herby tahini dressing that is excellent poured over lightly blanched green beans.Green Falafel Smash BurgersHerby chickpea falafel gets the veggie burger treatment with harissa mayo and pickled onion.Juicy Bison Burger With Cucumber–Red Onion SlawUpgrade any cookout—or keep the cooking on the stovetop—with these smashed cast-iron bison burgers, then stack with lemon mayo and a crisp cucumber-onion slaw.Tomato AguachileJuicy peak-season tomatoes make the perfect plant-based swap for aguachile.Marinated Grilled PeppersLetting just-grilled, still-warm peppers marinate in a bright and punchy vinaigrette allows the flavors to permeate even further.Crispy Rice Salad With Spicy Tahini DressingWith crunchy cabbage, sweet mango, and ripe avocado, this salad will keep you full.One-Pot Summer Vegetable PastaHigh on zucchini, corn, eggplant, and tomatoes.
