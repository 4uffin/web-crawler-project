Fill your totes with heirlooms and pack your pockets with Sun Golds: Each day, we’re sharing a brand new, extra-delicious way to make the most of this fleeting season.While we’d never say no to an herby chimichurri or salsa verde, nothing packs the same umami punch as a sauce made from cooked-down tomatoes. Their sweet-tart-savory qualities become deeper and more majestic as they reduce, like a reddening sun diving toward the horizon. Add a handful of carefully layered spices and aromatics, and you’ve got a sauce that transforms a platter of steak into a summer fireworks display. Double up and save some in the fridge for later. Also excellent over grilled or roasted chicken or grilled eggplant.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleSee Related Recipes and Cooking TipsiconGalleryAll the Recipes From *Bon Appétit*’s Summer IssueWe’ve got sausage with cabbage and giardiniera, tomato aguachile, and matcha-berry frozen yogurt.ChevronChevronRead MoreGingery Pork Stuffed TomatoesWe reimagined pork dumplings as a filling for juicy stuffed tomatoes.Tomato AguachileJuicy peak-season tomatoes make the perfect plant-based swap for aguachile.Turkish-Style Eggs and TomatoesThis riff on çılbır marries garlicky yogurt, fried eggs, and spiced butter with summer tomatoes.Quick Butter-Braised Tomatoes and DumplingsStore-bought dumplings, fresh tomatoes, butter, and soy sauce simmer away for dinner in a flash.Juicy Bison Burger With Cucumber–Red Onion SlawUpgrade any cookout—or keep the cooking on the stovetop—with these smashed cast-iron bison burgers, then stack with lemon mayo and a crisp cucumber-onion slaw.Pad Kra PaoThis fast stir-fry dish pairs minced pork and fragrant basil with hot Thai chiles and a crispy fried egg.Steak Salad With Feta DressingJuicy steak, crisp lettuce, and a blender dressing come together for a breezy summer dinner.Five-Spice Beef Noodle SoupInspired by the flavors of Vietnamese pho, this ground beef and rice noodle soup comes together in just 20 minutes.Since 1995, Epicurious has been the ultimate food resource for the home cook, with daily kitchen tips, fun cooking videos, and, oh yeah, over 33,000 recipes.FacebookXPinterestYouTubeInstagramAbout UsThe Epicurious AppNewslettersSubscription FAQsGift GuidesCareersPress CenterAdvertisingMastheadUser AgreementPrivacy PolicyYour California Privacy RightsAccessibility HelpCondé Nast Store© 2025 Condé Nast.
