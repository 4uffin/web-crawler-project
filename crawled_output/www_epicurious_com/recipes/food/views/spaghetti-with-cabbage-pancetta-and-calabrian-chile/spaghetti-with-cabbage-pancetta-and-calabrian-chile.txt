MeekerArrowJump To RecipeSave StorySave this storyPrintCabbage is the unsung hero of the winter kitchen—available anywhere, long-lasting in the fridge, and super affordable. It is also an excellent partner for pasta. Caramelizing the cabbage in butter creates a deep sweetness and silky texture, with the denser portions of the leaves retaining a bit of juicy crunch.Here, spicy Calabrian chiles add a contrasting kick of heat; look for them in a jar in the condiment section of the grocery store. Add them late in the cooking process so their flavor doesn’t fully permeate the whole dish but rather creates little pops of heat and acidity in each bite. The recipe calls for 1 tsp., which is a moderate amount; if you’re a hothead, increase that amount.Note: Slice up a few peperoncini and add them to the sauce when you add the Calabrian chiles; they’ll contribute a nice acidity and a bit of a sauerkraut flavor.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleRead MoreOur Favorite French Onion SoupCaramelized onions, melty Gruyère, and a deeply savory broth deliver the kind of comfort that doesn’t need improving.Simple Hot Cocoa for OneWith rich chocolate flavor and easy customization, this hot cocoa recipe is just the one you want to get you through winter.Béchamel SauceThis classic 15-minute sauce is your secret weapon for homemade mac and cheese, chowder, lasagna, and more.Dulce de LecheMake this versatile caramel at home with our slow-simmered method using milk and sugar—or take one of two sweetened condensed milk shortcuts.Moo Ping (Thai Grilled Pork Skewers)This version of pork skewers is made in the oven, which tastes just as good, but you could always throw these on the grill for a version closer to the original.Black Sesame Tofu “Basque” CheesecakeThere are many things that appeal about a Basque cheesecake—it's crustless (one less job) and is meant to look “rustic” with its wrinkled and jagged sides.Vinegar Chicken With FigsA weeknight-friendly chicken dinner with two kinds of vinegar, dried figs, and a rich sauce.
