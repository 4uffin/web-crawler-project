The density and softness of this dish always delivers healing to my belly and my soul. This slow-simmering Oxtail Guisado is a Caribbean-inspired dish that originates in the Dominican Republic. Unlike other versions of the dish, which often feature brown sugar and soy sauce, this one is made with tomato paste, which lends its vibrant red hue, sweeter finish, and body to the sauce. You can replace the Goya seasonings called for with more salt and pepper to taste. You can also use other cuts of boneless meat, such as short ribs, if oxtails aren’t available. Boneless short ribs take significantly less time to cook so adjust the simmering time as needed.Read More: I Wanted My Pre-Baby Body Back.
