So 2021. But a frozen espresso martini? Now that’s a sign of the times (as evidenced by your social media feed). A frozen espresso martini is like a Frappuccino for adults. By taking the cult classic and blending it with ice, the drink becomes borderline dangerous in its drinkability. It’s cold, it’s strong, it tastes like coffee and dessert at the same time.Making this coffee cocktail is simple. Choose a basic vodka, nothing too fancy. There are a few different brands of coffee liqueur out there—we like Kahlúa best. If you use another brand, you may need to adjust the sugar in the final drink to fine-tune the sweetness. (Baileys, another popular liqueur, contains cream and isn’t quite potent enough here.)Where most recipes use brewed espresso for the coffee element, this frozen espresso martini recipe makes use of convenient and shelf-stable instant espresso powder. Instant espresso powder means no fussing about with espresso machines, or heading to your nearest coffee shop to buy a quad shot, or freezing leftover coffee in an ice cube tray to make espresso cubes. Don’t be tempted to use cold brew. It’s too weak and will only dilute the frozen drink. And no need to go through the additional prep time of making simple syrup when you can simply add sugar to the blender with the rest of the ingredients.While you could stop there, a flourish of whipped cream takes this frozen cocktail into affogato territory. Hand whip the cream for the best texture. You want it soft and swoopy. Feeling extra cheeky? Go with ice cream instead of whipped cream. And if you really want to play bartender, garnish the top with espresso beans (or coffee beans in a pinch), just like you might with a classic espresso martini. Served in a martini glass, or a fancy coupe glass, this is a drink that just wants you to have a good time.Want more frozen cocktail recipes? Right this way.
