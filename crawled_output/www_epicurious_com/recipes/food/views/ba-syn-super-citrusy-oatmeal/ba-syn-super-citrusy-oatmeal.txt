When the mornings are gray and the weather’s gloomy, I crave pick-me-up foods that bring brightness and energy, and nothing does that better than citrus. I typically use navel oranges for this oatmeal, but you can add a variety of grapefruits, blood oranges, Cara Caras, and any other citrus fruit that’s in season.I use steel-cut oats and unsweetened plant-based milk for a hearty, chewy base to absorb all that vibrance, which you also get from the fresh orange zest and juice. A drizzle of ginger syrup adds an extra cheerful tang, but you can use maple syrup or honey instead if that’s your vibe. (I personally skip those sweeter syrups because I find the fruit and spices to be plenty sweet and fragrant already.) Some cinnamon goes a long way in warming out any tartness, but you can also go lighter or heavier on the zest and juice to get the level of citrusy flavor you like.I top it all with slices of fresh citrus and pomegranate seeds for a colorful finish—and a cozy, sunshine-in-a-bowl breakfast that always reminds me how, even in the coldest months, there’s plenty of brightness to be found.Read More: A Citrusy Oatmeal to Chase Away the Winter BluesRecipe notesBack to topTriangleRead MoreBlueberry Muffin Baked OatmealA nourishing, cozy breakfast you can throw together with fresh or frozen berries.Horchata Overnight OatsA big batch of overnight oats made with chopped almonds and mild rice milk that tastes just like horchata.
