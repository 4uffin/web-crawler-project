It’s one of those dishes that is initially met with some skepticism (yogurt soup? cold? with just cucumber?), which is all the more reason that I encourage people to try it, often finding they come back for a second helping. This soup is best made with Persian cucumbers, which are smaller, sweeter, and more intensely flavored, but regular cucumbers work fine too—­just peel them first. Be sure to use full-­fat Greek-­style yogurt (not strained or low-­fat), and I prefer to use sea salt flakes as they have a more pronounced mineral flavor. You can find edible dried rose petals in Iranian grocery stores or online; they aren’t essential, but a small pinch does make this soup take on a more elegant quality. This soup keeps in the fridge for about 24 hours.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleSee Related Recipes and Cooking Tips16 Standout Cookbooks for Summer 2025Here are the titles we’re keeping cracked in our own kitchens—recipes included.ChevronChevronRead MoreZucchini, Pea, and Bulgur PilafThis fragrant salad uses bulgur wheat as its base, an endlessly versatile, slightly chewy grain that’s very popular throughout the eastern Mediterranean.Roasted Snap Pea Salad With Yakult-Style DressingThis crunchy, creamy salad has everything you want for a cookout.Brussels Sprouts LatkesWho says latkes have to be potato?
