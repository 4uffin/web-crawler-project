From southern Thailand, gai hat yai is known for its crispy skin, great aromatics, and super juicy meat. Traditionally, it’s served with crispy fried shallots and sticky rice, but we also often eat it with som tum thai (green papaya salad). Over the years I have experimented with many different variations in the dipping and coating sauce to make this dish right up there with other popular fried chicken dishes of the world.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleRead MoreOur Favorite French Onion SoupCaramelized onions, melty Gruyère, and a deeply savory broth deliver the kind of comfort that doesn’t need improving.Béchamel SauceThis classic 15-minute sauce is your secret weapon for homemade mac and cheese, chowder, lasagna, and more.Stir-Fried Phở Noodles With BeefThis dish is not only a quick meal option but also a practical way to use leftover phở noodles when you’re out of broth.Minty Chicken MeatballsWho says ground chicken is boring?
