Originating in Italy, the name of the dish means “mixed fried things,” and it’s very versatile. Some recipes include a plethora of seafood like calamari, scallops, and anchovies, along with vegetables like artichokes, zucchini, eggplant, and sage leaves. This version streamlines things with a trio of large shrimp, mixed mushrooms, and fennel, laced with crispy leaves of fragrant fresh basil.There are two keys to the light and crunchy exterior. First is white rice flour, which absorbs less oil than all-purpose flour, helping the fritto misto retain its integrity long after frying. The second is club soda or seltzer, which helps to create an airy tempura-like batter with lots of bubbles trapped in its crispy walls.The good news is you don’t need a dedicated fryer to make fritto misto. A Dutch oven or similar heavy-bottomed pot works perfectly. Fry the shrimp and vegetables in alternating batches until golden brown and crispy, then transfer them with a slotted spoon to a paper towel to absorb excess hot oil. Season generously with kosher or sea salt, and serve with lemon wedges or aioli for a light, bright Italian appetizer—or enjoy it for lunch alongside a big Italian salad.All products featured on Epicurious are independently selected by our editors.
