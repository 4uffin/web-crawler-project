Consider ours to be a deluxe version. An entire bag of frozen strawberries keeps the blended drink frosty and so fruity, it might as well be a spiked smoothie.This frozen drink utilizes the basic tenets of a classic daiquiri—a shaken drink of lime, rum, and sugar that dates back to 20th-century Cuba—just with the addition of frozen fruit. Think of it as a grown-up Slurpee with minimal ingredients and a definite buzz.This is the kind of cocktail recipe that doesn’t need overthinking. Forget the daiquiri mix. Start with frozen strawberries. They create the perfect texture without having to add too many ice cubes. In fact, there’s no ice at all in this strawberry daiquiri recipe. If you have a glut of fresh strawberries on hand, hull and freeze them for at least an hour and use those instead. White rum (a synonym for light rum) is the way to go here. Dark rum will muddy the color and its spice will overpower the strawberry flavor.A bit of sugar blended with the fruit does the job of simple syrup. Taste and adjust the sweetness depending on the ripeness of your frozen berries. Some brands are more tart than others. (We like Wyman’s brand of frozen strawberries for their intense color and sweet fragrance.) Freshly squeezed lime juice takes a little prep time but makes a big difference. It’s the high acidity that makes this the best strawberry daiquiri. Don’t use the bottled kind, no matter how tempting. It lacks the floral flavor and fragrance of fresh-squeezed.To finish, garnish with a fresh strawberry, lime slice, or our favorite, a tiny cocktail umbrella. This easy frozen strawberry daiquiri looks great in a glass, making you feel like you’re on vacation, even as you sweat through the summer days at home.Want more frozen cocktail recipes?
