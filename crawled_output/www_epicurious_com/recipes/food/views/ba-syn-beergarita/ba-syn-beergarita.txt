Crisp, bright flavors of Mexican lager mellow out punchy citrus and tequila, making this drink just right for hot days.We love mixing up a batch for game-day gatherings, backyard barbecues, and all-day porch hangs. Swap in other acidic juices such as grapefruit, lemonade, or even mango nectar to remix the vibe. If you're hosting a bash, create a mixed salt station to allow guests to customize their own glasses. Think chile-lime as in Tajín, flaky sea salt, and even the pink stuff, for whimsy.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleSee Related Recipes and Cooking TipsiconGalleryAll the Recipes From *Bon Appétit*’s Sports IssueWe’ve got chocolate-date bran muffins, sheet-pan chicken souvlaki, and salmon with sizzle nut salsa.ChevronChevronRead MoreSake-Grapefruit FizzThis light and drinkable cocktail pairs the bittersweet flavor of grapefruit with botanical gin and sparkling sake for a bubbly finish.Bicycle BanditA riff on the Bicycle Thief cocktail, a citrusy, low ABV riff on a Negroni, this three-ingredient, party-ready twist features grapefruit soda.BA’s Best Old-FashionedA classic drink that never goes out of style.
