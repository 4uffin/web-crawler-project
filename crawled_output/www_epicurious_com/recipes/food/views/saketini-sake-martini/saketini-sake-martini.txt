Now is not the moment to dig the bottle you can’t even remember buying from the back of the fridge. Something light, fruity, floral, and meant for sipping is the move. Sake is classified in part by the amount of polishing done to its headlining ingredient, rice. The varieties available in the US range from affordable table sakes called Futsushu to top-shelf Daiginjo. The best sake for any cocktail recipe is one you like to drink; for a saketini, try an aromatic Junmai Ginjo, which tends to be fresh and dry and has savory undertones that complement dry vermouth. Sake has a lower alcohol content than gin, which makes most of the balance of a classic martini, so this drink is less boozy than its forebears.It’s versatile too. Muddle a cucumber slice in your cocktail shaker before adding ice, and swap the gin for vodka to make a cucumber saketini. Instead of sake, try shochu, the Japanese spirit distilled from grains or vegetables. Substitute lychee liqueur for the vermouth to make a sake-lychee martini; garnish it with a skewered lychee. Serve your saketini in a Nick & Nora or any stemmed cocktail glass in your cupboard. To quickly chill glassware, fill with ice water while you prep the drinks.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleRead MoreBicycle BanditA riff on the Bicycle Thief cocktail, a citrusy, low ABV riff on a Negroni, this three-ingredient, party-ready twist features grapefruit soda.Hugo SpritzWith elderflower liqueur, mint, and prosecco, the effervescent Hugo spritz cocktail is a hit year round, but particularly on warm nights.Rob RoyNamed for a Scottish revolutionary, a New York City operetta—or both—this effortless scotch cocktail is built to last.Sake-Grapefruit FizzThis light and drinkable cocktail pairs the bittersweet flavor of grapefruit with botanical gin and sparkling sake for a bubbly finish.Paloma SlushyFrozen into a slushy, the classic tequila and grapefruit cocktail becomes even more refreshing.Sea BreezeGourmet’s version of this perfect summer drink mixes the ideal ratio of vodka with cranberry and grapefruit juices, right in the glass.Violet Vodka SlushyCrème de violette is an exuberantly floral violet liqueur that gives vibrant color to this fun frozen cocktail.Dirty SpritzIn this nonalcoholic take on a spritz, which typically features a bitter liqueur with sparkling wine or fizzy water, the olive brine brings flavor and depth.Since 1995, Epicurious has been the ultimate food resource for the home cook, with daily kitchen tips, fun cooking videos, and, oh yeah, over 33,000 recipes.FacebookXPinterestYouTubeInstagramAbout UsThe Epicurious AppNewslettersSubscription FAQsGift GuidesCareersPress CenterAdvertisingMastheadUser AgreementPrivacy PolicyYour California Privacy RightsAccessibility HelpCondé Nast Store© 2025 Condé Nast.
