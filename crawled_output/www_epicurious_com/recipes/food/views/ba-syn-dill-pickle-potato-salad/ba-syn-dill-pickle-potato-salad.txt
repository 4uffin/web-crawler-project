This process doesn't have to take days. In fact, you only need a matter of minutes to yield the crunchiest, freshest, tangiest pickles in all the land. Just thinly slice cucumbers, then quickly soak them in a mustard-vinegar brine. That’s it. Toss these with boiled potatoes and lots of dill—and you have the potato salad of the summer. It's great with grilled anything (especially chicken or pork).Red potatoes are cute and contrast well against the cukes, but yellow ones like Yukon Golds work just fine if that’s what you have. Whatever you do, avoid using teeny-weeny peewee potatoes for this salad. They have too much skin compared to creamy insides and don’t sufficiently take in the dressing well (we tried). Use golf-ball-size potatoes and cut them up to maximize their absorbent surface area.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleSee Related Recipes and Cooking TipsiconGalleryThe Most-Saved Recipes in the Epicurious App in MayLike green falafel smash burgers and a crispy rice salad.ChevronChevronRead MoreGreen Beans With Tahini SbagliatoAn accidental recipe (sbagliatio means mistaken in Italian) yields a delicious herby tahini dressing that is excellent poured over lightly blanched green beans.Sheet-Pan Pierogies and BeetsA flavorful one-pan meal featuring baked pierogies, roasted beets, and a poppy seed dressing.
