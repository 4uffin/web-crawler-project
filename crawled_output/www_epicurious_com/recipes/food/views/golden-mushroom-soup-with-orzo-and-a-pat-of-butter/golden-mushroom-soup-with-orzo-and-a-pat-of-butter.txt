But what you’re likely underestimating is the power of mushrooms (naturally high in umami, a fever dream of mixed textures, visually dazzling in all their shapes and sizes), which are doing most if not all of the heavy lifting here. Technically this recipe can be done with all button or crimini mushrooms, but I can’t say it will look or taste as good as it does with a mix of the more exotic types, such as oyster, maitake, or chanterelle. The simplicity of this soup means you do have to be vigilant about seasoning (especially if you’re so bravely using water instead of broth), salting, peppering, and adjusting with fish sauce as you go. That said, I really enjoy the monk-like restraint of the mushroom-garlic-water magic that occurs (with a fish sauce assist, of course), creating a broth that is delicate and earthy, evoking a very good, robust mushroom tea.EAT WITH: In keeping with the monastic theme, I like to eat this soup alone (often for lunch), but for dinner (maybe even with others), I think a giant piece of toasted bread or baguette to dunk into the broth would be nice.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleRead MoreOur Favorite French Onion SoupCaramelized onions, melty Gruyère, and a deeply savory broth deliver the kind of comfort that doesn’t need improving.Kung Pao Cabbage With TofuReliable cabbage is cooked in the punchy sauce and then combined with store-bought baked tofu and roasted cashews for a salad that can also be eaten with rice.Béchamel SauceThis classic 15-minute sauce is your secret weapon for homemade mac and cheese, chowder, lasagna, and more.5-Minute Chocolate Mug CakeYes, it's a shortcut in a microwave.
