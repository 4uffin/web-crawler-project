This flavor-packed summer vegetable stew is great warm—and possibly even better cold or room temperature the next day, making it ideal for meal prep.Originating from Provence, France, traditional ratatouille combines zucchini, eggplant, and sweet peppers with fresh tomatoes, but the formula is adaptable. Out of zucchini? Yellow squash works fine. You could substitute red onions, leeks, or any type of onion, really. Replace the individual dried herbs with a dash of herbes de Provence or a bundle of fresh thyme, savory, or oregano sprigs. Finish the cooked ratatouille with a scattering of mixed fresh herbs, including parsley and chervil, along with the basil from your garden.Serve your ratatouille as a side dish to pan-seared pork chops or grilled fish. Top it with a jammy egg over crusty bread, or turn it into the star of a vegetarian main course by spooning it over Creamy Polenta or tossing with pasta.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleSee Related Recipes and Cooking TipsiconGalleryThe Most-Saved Recipes in the Epicurious App in JuneLike hummingbird cake and a steak salad with feta dressing.iconGallery23 Fresh Basil Recipes for Pesto and BeyondGrilled corn with basil butter, pineapple shrimp noodles, slow-cooker pork with zesty basil sauce, and more.iconGalleryOur 29 Best July RecipesOur most popular recipes for the month—plus a few staff picks.iconGallery46 Fresh Tomato Recipes to Make While Summer Is HotThere’s no time like summertime for tomatoes.
