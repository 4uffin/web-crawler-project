Blending cauliflower into “cauli rice” can transform the vegetable into the perfect texture and size to resemble the ground nature of the meat. The cauliflower bits release their moisture and soften as they cook, easily absorbing the deep, warm spices and umami-packed notes you’d taste in a classic chorizo. Sprinkle it on tostadas, quesadillas, and potato tacos, on top of refried beans, or use in sopes.Editor’s note: Especially for plant-based cooking, mushroom powder is an invaluable addition to your spice rack.
