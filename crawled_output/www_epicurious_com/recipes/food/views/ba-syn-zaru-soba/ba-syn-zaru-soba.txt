I was little and shirtless, a kitchen towel draped around my neck, legs swinging off the chair, the steady hum of our window AC unit in the background. On a hot summer day, those cold buckwheat noodles were pure relief—dinner that could quench as much as it could satisfy.These days, when the humidity sets in, I still reach for this cold noodle dish to cool down from the inside out. To remove every trace of starch, my mother would rinse the cooked soba under cold running water, scrubbing them like laundry. This step shocks the hot noodles, setting their bouncy texture and preventing clumping.Next comes the mentsuyu—a savory noodle soup base that serves as a dipping sauce, typically made from dashi, mirin, soy sauce, and sake. To keep it weeknight-easy, I skip the sake (no one in my family seems to notice). Meanwhile, instant dashi powder delivers deep umami flavor, bypassing the need to make a homemade version with kombu and bonito flakes.To serve, pile the cold soba noodles into a bowl and pour the mentsuyu into a separate, small bowl. Drop in a couple of ice cubes to chill and gently dilute the sauce—like a martini on the rocks, but saltier. I finish the noodles with sliced green onions, shredded nori, a dab of wasabi, and a mound of grated daikon radish. Don’t skip that last one—this bittersweet garnish is like fluffy snow, melting into the sauce.You could arrange the zaru soba in picture-perfect compositions like my mother always did. But more often, I eat them right from the strainer with chopsticks—noodles flying, mentsuyu splashing—until the bowl is empty and I’m cool again.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleSee Related Recipes and Cooking TipsiconGalleryAll the Recipes From *Bon Appétit*’s Sports IssueWe’ve got chocolate-date bran muffins, sheet-pan chicken souvlaki, and salmon with sizzle nut salsa.ChevronChevronRead MoreMentaiko SpaghettiIn this wafu pasta recipe from author Sonoko Sakai, the only cooking involved is boiling spaghetti.Angel Hair BibimguksuGochujang creates a sauce that delivers the perfect balance of spice, tang, and sweetness.Smoked Mackerel UdonChewy noodles, tinned fish, and hardy greens in an umami broth.Maple TamagoyakiFrom author Sonoko Sakai, this Japanese omelet is distinguished by its fluffy layers, with a touch of sweetness from maple syrup.Okonomiyaki Tater TotsCrispy tots topped with savory-sweet sauce, mayonnaise, furikake, scallion, and katsuobushi.Microwaved Tofu With Butter and Soy SauceThis custardy and comforting tofu comes together in minutes, all thanks to your microwave.
