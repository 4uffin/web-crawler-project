Searing the squid rings and tentacles (look for them in the freezer section of your grocer or online) without stirring builds flavor and color, while tossing them around for the second half of the cooking session finishes them quickly.Consider this a blueprint for any squid salad you can dream up. Swap out the olives for anything briny, such as capers or pickled artichoke hearts. Or use any type of fresh herbs that appeal to you (basil, mint, tarragon, or dill would all be fantastic). Big on crunch? Bump up the celery. Need more acid? The other half of the lemon is sitting right there. Craving some heat? Crushed red pepper flakes are nice. The point is, this is our ideal calamari salad recipe; now go make it your own.Although delicious when eaten right away, this dish tastes even better if allowed to marinate in the fridge for up to 8 hours. Bring it to room temperature (about 1 hour) before serving. Plate as a main course or appetizer as is or on a bed of romaine.
