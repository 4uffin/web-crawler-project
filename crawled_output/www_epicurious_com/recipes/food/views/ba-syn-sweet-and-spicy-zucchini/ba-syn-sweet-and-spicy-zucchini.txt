Things like pickled chiles and preserved lemon paste, which require an investment of time on the front end but make day-to-day cooking easier, more delicious, and distinctive. “You’re giving your future self a gift,” she says. These flavor-packed elements show up in recipes throughout the book, and Nosrat hopes that readers will “start to see the pattern of how I incorporate these ingredients, and feel more liberated to make choices for themselves.” We’ve adapted her zucchini recipe to incorporate store-bought preserved lemons and Calabrian chile paste, but the recipes for the homemade versions you’ll find in Good Things are reason alone to buy the book.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleRead MoreZucchini ButterTransform summer squash into this spectacular spread to put toward sandwiches, pastas, and more all season long.Gourmet’s Classic RatatouilleSummer’s best produce cooked into one vibrant, silky, flavor-packed dish.Green Beans With Tahini SbagliatoAn accidental recipe (sbagliatio means mistaken in Italian) yields a delicious herby tahini dressing that is excellent poured over lightly blanched green beans.Tomato AguachileJuicy peak-season tomatoes make the perfect plant-based swap for aguachile.Steamed Vegetables With Miso-Ginger DressingThis assertive dressing is the perfect complement to tender, delicate steamed vegetables.One-Pot Summer Vegetable PastaHigh on zucchini, corn, eggplant, and tomatoes.
