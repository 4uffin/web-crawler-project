Try frozen blueberries, sweet or tart cherries, bananas, or mangoes as fun variations. While whole-milk Greek yogurt makes the creamiest fro-yo, a nondairy coconut yogurt version also performed well in our tests. Substitute coconut or cashew cream for the heavy cream.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleSee Related Recipes and Cooking TipsiconGalleryAll the Recipes From *Bon Appétit*’s Summer IssueWe’ve got sausage with cabbage and giardiniera, tomato aguachile, and matcha-berry frozen yogurt.ChevronChevronRead MoreSummer Berry Stovetop CrispThis no-oven-needed crisp can be made with almost any fresh berry (we’d avoid raspberries) and comes together within 45 minutes.Dark Chocolate Flax BarkCrunchy, seedy flax crackers get topped with dark chocolate and a showering of sea salt for the ultimate sweet and salty snack.Neapolitan CakeInspired by Wayne Thiebaud’s iconic Cake Slice, these three distinct layers start with one simple batter.Grilled Pound Cake Sundae With RaspberriesThis is the perfect summer party dessert, featuring grilled pound cake, Cointreau-spiked raspberries, and classic vanilla ice cream.Matcha-Mango Chia PuddingFeaturing a bright layer of sweet mango, these colorful chia puddings are worth waking up early for.
