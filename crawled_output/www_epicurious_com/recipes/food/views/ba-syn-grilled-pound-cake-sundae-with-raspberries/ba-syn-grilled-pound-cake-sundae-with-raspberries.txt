Tender and rich with a compact ingredient list, it’s a candidate for Best Cake to Whip Up for Company, no matter the occasion.Making all of the components of this summery dessert well in advance means this recipe is ideal for hosting. Bake your pound cake a day in advance, then slice and grill it before your guests arrive (you’ll want to get it on the fire before any saucy meat or vegetables that could leave burnt bits on the grate). The Cointreau-spiked macerated raspberries are better the longer they sit, and chopped toasted pistachios can wait their turn in a bowl on the counter. At go time, just scoop vanilla ice cream and assemble!This sundae is as riffable as you want it to be. Short on time? Use store-brought pound cake instead. Pistachio allergy? Try almonds. Dealing with a blackberry or peach abundance from the farmers market? Swap in a different summer fruit. Vanilla ice cream makes for a nice neutral base, but you could change that up, too, if you’re feeling adventurous.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleSee Related Recipes and Cooking TipsiconGalleryAll the Recipes From *Bon Appétit*’s Summer IssueWe’ve got sausage with cabbage and giardiniera, tomato aguachile, and matcha-berry frozen yogurt.ChevronChevronRead MoreStrawberry-Rhubarb Cheesecake BarsThese bright cheesecake bars feature spring’s favorite flavor duo and a Triscuit cracker crust.Pistachio Bundt CakePredestined to be the star of your next weekend hang or holiday brunch.Neapolitan CakeInspired by Wayne Thiebaud’s iconic Cake Slice, these three distinct layers start with one simple batter.Summer Berry Stovetop CrispThis no-oven-needed crisp can be made with almost any fresh berry (we’d avoid raspberries) and comes together within 45 minutes.Hummingbird CakeOur spin on the beloved classic, featuring pineapple jam and cream cheese frosting.Matcha-Berry Frozen YogurtFroyo for one, made in a blender and topped with a crackly magic shell.Diner-Style Apple Pie With Lattice CrustCut this easy-to-handle dough (thanks, cream cheese) into wide strips for a fast-forming lattice that stuns.Flourless Chocolate-Orange CakeParty-ready and delightfully simple, this fudgy cake will become your go-to hosting dessert.Since 1995, Epicurious has been the ultimate food resource for the home cook, with daily kitchen tips, fun cooking videos, and, oh yeah, over 33,000 recipes.FacebookXPinterestYouTubeInstagramAbout UsThe Epicurious AppNewslettersSubscription FAQsGift GuidesCareersPress CenterAdvertisingMastheadUser AgreementPrivacy PolicyYour California Privacy RightsAccessibility HelpCondé Nast Store© 2025 Condé Nast.
