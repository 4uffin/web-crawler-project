Classically, the drink lightens up a gin and Campari base with a combination of fresh grapefruit and lemon juice, simple syrup, and club soda. This iteration is a party-ready three-ingredient twist, incorporating store-bought grapefruit soda instead.We tested a lot of grapefruit sodas in creating our itineration of this drink. Our favorite is San Pellegrino Pompelmo, though Jarritos and Squirt are also great. Just avoid grapefruit-flavored seltzer—you need more sweetness than it brings to the party.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleSee Related Recipes and Cooking TipsiconGalleryAll the Recipes From *Bon Appétit*’s Summer IssueWe’ve got sausage with cabbage and giardiniera, tomato aguachile, and matcha-berry frozen yogurt.ChevronChevronRead MoreSake-Grapefruit FizzThis light and drinkable cocktail pairs the bittersweet flavor of grapefruit with botanical gin and sparkling sake for a bubbly finish.Sea BreezeGourmet’s version of this perfect summer drink mixes the ideal ratio of vodka with cranberry and grapefruit juices, right in the glass.Paloma SlushyFrozen into a slushy, the classic tequila and grapefruit cocktail becomes even more refreshing.SaketiniA short list of ingredients comes together in this elegant sake martini.Dirty SpritzIn this nonalcoholic take on a spritz, which typically features a bitter liqueur with sparkling wine or fizzy water, the olive brine brings flavor and depth.Rob RoyNamed for a Scottish revolutionary, a New York City operetta—or both—this effortless scotch cocktail is built to last.Hugo SpritzWith elderflower liqueur, mint, and prosecco, the effervescent Hugo spritz cocktail is a hit year round, but particularly on warm nights.Violet Vodka SlushyCrème de violette is an exuberantly floral violet liqueur that gives vibrant color to this fun frozen cocktail.Since 1995, Epicurious has been the ultimate food resource for the home cook, with daily kitchen tips, fun cooking videos, and, oh yeah, over 33,000 recipes.FacebookXPinterestYouTubeInstagramAbout UsThe Epicurious AppNewslettersSubscription FAQsGift GuidesCareersPress CenterAdvertisingMastheadUser AgreementPrivacy PolicyYour California Privacy RightsAccessibility HelpCondé Nast Store© 2025 Condé Nast.
