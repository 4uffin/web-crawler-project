As the salmon roasts, the magic salsa comes together, sizzling an array of finely chopped nuts in oil until they are golden and toasted. Using a store-bought blend of mixed nuts—like the kind dubbed cocktail nuts meant for snacking—is the key to making a salsa with a variety of colors and textures without having to buy multiple bags of individual nuts. (Although you can use whatever near-empty bags of nuts you have on hand.) The sauce is poured over the salmon, then scattered with a bushel of fresh mint and cilantro. Serve it with rice, cooked noodles, toasted bread, or potatoes to sop up all the flavorful oil.Perfectly cooking a large piece of salmon can be intimidating, but the best way to tell when it is done is to flake a bit of the flesh in the center: It should come apart easily and look light pink and opaque. If you’re still unsure, an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part should register 145°.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleSee Related Recipes and Cooking TipsiconGalleryAll the Recipes From *Bon Appétit*’s Sports IssueWe’ve got chocolate-date bran muffins, sheet-pan chicken souvlaki, and salmon with sizzle nut salsa.ChevronChevronRead MoreSheet-Pan Salmon With Rice Cakes and KimchiA comforting dinner of chewy rice cakes, punchy kimchi, bok choy, and perfectly flaky salmon made entirely on just one sheet pan.Soy-Glazed Salmon BowlsSaucy, soy-honey salmon—cut into cubes to speed up the cooking process—makes a savory topping for a quick weeknight bowl.Air-Fryer Sea Bass With Dilly Potato Chip CrustCrushed potato chips (mixed with a bit of mayo) make a delightfully crispy and nostalgic-tasting topping for flaky white fish.Crispy Salmon With Avocado SauceYou’ll want to put this creamy (but dairy-free) green sauce on everything and it’s particularly sublime under crispy-skinned salmon.Sheet-Pan Pomegranate Chicken With Walnut RelishThis weeknight-friendly chicken dinner—made with pomegranate molasses and a toasted walnut relish—is inspired by the flavors of Persian fesenjan.Beet-Salmon Salad With Horseradish YogurtCooked beets, flaked salmon, and an array of crunchy vegetables crown a bed of spicy horseradish yogurt in this hearty salad.Greenest Mint and Ginger PestoAn electrifying pesto that stays bright green for days on end.
