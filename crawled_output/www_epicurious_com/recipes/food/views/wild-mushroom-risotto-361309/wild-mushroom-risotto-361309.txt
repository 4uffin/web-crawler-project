Calling them “wild” is a bit of a misnomer, as hen of the woods mushrooms and shiitakes are commercially grown. Porcini mushrooms and chanterelles are a bit harder to track down (and pricier), because they are still primarily foraged, but you can find them in season at the farmers market or specialty grocery stores. Chanterelle season generally runs between spring and fall, while porcini are available during the autumn.Risotto has a reputation for being challenging, but making a good one is really just a matter of patience. Browning the mushrooms, sweating the leeks, warming the chicken stock, toasting the rice: All of these steps take a moment, but in doing so, you’re coaxing the most flavor out of each ingredient. Constant stirring creates the signature creamy texture—but don’t overcook the rice. Al dente is the way to go.You can serve this recipe the traditional Italian way, in small portions before the main course, but no one will hold it against you if you decide to make this the center of your meal. If you’re serving this risotto recipe family-style, consider warming the serving bowl before placing the risotto in it—this will help it maintain its perfect creamy texture, all the way to the plate. Garnish each serving with additional Parmesan cheese if you wish, but it’s not required.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleSee Related Recipes and Cooking TipsiconGallery47 Fall Dinner Ideas You’ll Crave All SeasonRecipes for back-to-school, sweater weather, and more.iconGallery23 Risotto Recipes for Silky, Creamy Dinners at HomeTurn any Tuesday into a night of luxury with our favorite risotto recipes.iconGallery59 Date Night Recipes for a Romantic Night InCandlelight dinner ideas that don’t involve making a reservation?
