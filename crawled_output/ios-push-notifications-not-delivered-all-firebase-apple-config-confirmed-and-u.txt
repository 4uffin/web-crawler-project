I’m experiencing a critical issue where iOS push notifications are not being delivered to my app, even though all configuration and checklist items are confirmed to be correct.
Details:
Firebase Project: [rise-daily-7cff8]
iOS Bundle ID: com.josephmudie.Daily-Bread.dev
Push notifications enabled on Apple and in Xcode, using APNs Auth Key (.p8), correctly uploaded to Firebase
Firebase configured in AppDelegate, APNs token passed to FCM (Messaging.messaging().apnsToken = deviceToken)
Push permission/registration handled via Capacitor JS, prompt only after login, latest FCM token always used
UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate is implemented in AppDelegate
Swizzling ON (default), no custom settings
Test notifications from Firebase Console never delivered (no banner, no foreground, no error logs)
No errors in Xcode console or device logs
All troubleshooting steps in Firebase docs confirmed
Second Problem:
I have attempted to submit a detailed support ticket through the Firebase Support Portal
, but I am repeatedly getting
"Error submitting request. Please try again later."
I have tried different browsers, incognito, different accounts, shortened messages, and waited over an hour, but the issue persists.
Request:
Push Issue: Can someone from Firebase help investigate why my iOS app is not receiving push notifications despite all setup being verified?
Support Portal Issue: Is there a workaround or alternate channel for opening a ticket when the main support form is broken?
Any help, escalation, or direct contact would be much appreciated!
Happy to provide screenshots, logs, or more info as needed.

The first thing to check is that your environments match. If you are using a dev build (ie not from the AppStore), are you using a dev certificate in your firebase configuration. are you testing on a real device. Do you have a paid developer program membership (presumably yes or you wouldn't be able to create the required certificate)

Please note that this site is not Firebase support. Please edit your question and remove all mention of the problem with the Firebase support portal. Please focus on your one main issue regarding push notifications.
