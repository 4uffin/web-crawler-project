I’m experiencing a critical issue where iOS push notifications are not being delivered to my app, even though all configuration and checklist items are confirmed to be correct.
Details:
Firebase Project: [rise-daily-7cff8]
iOS Bundle ID: com.josephmudie.Daily-Bread.dev
Push notifications enabled on Apple and in Xcode, using APNs Auth Key (.p8), correctly uploaded to Firebase
Firebase configured in AppDelegate, APNs token passed to FCM (Messaging.messaging().apnsToken = deviceToken)
Push permission/registration handled via Capacitor JS, prompt only after login, latest FCM token always used
UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate is implemented in AppDelegate
Swizzling ON (default), no custom settings
Test notifications from Firebase Console never delivered (no banner, no foreground, no error logs)
No errors in Xcode console or device logs
All troubleshooting steps in Firebase docs confirmed
Request:
Push Issue: Can someone from Firebase help investigate why my iOS app is not receiving push notifications despite all setup being verified?
Any help, escalation, or direct contact would be much appreciated!
Happy to provide screenshots, logs, or more info as needed.
here is my appdelegate code:
import UIKit
import Capacitor
import FirebaseCore
import FirebaseMessaging
@UIApplicationMain
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {
var window: UIWindow?
func application(
_ application: UIApplication,
didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?
) -> Bool {
// Only configure Firebase—do NOT request push permission here!
if FirebaseApp.app() == nil {
FirebaseApp.configure()
}
return true
}
// Handle APNs device token for FCM, with explicit environment
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken deviceToken: Data) {
#if DEBUG
Messaging.messaging().setAPNSToken(deviceToken, type: .sandbox)
print("✅ Registered APNs sandbox token (DEBUG build)")
#else
Messaging.messaging().setAPNSToken(deviceToken, type: .prod)
print("✅ Registered APNs prod token (RELEASE build)")
#endif
}
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError error: Error) {
print("❌ Failed to register for remote notifications: (error.localizedDescription)")
}
}

The first thing to check is that your environments match. If you are using a dev build (ie not from the AppStore), are you using a dev certificate in your firebase configuration. are you testing on a real device. Do you have a paid developer program membership (presumably yes or you wouldn't be able to create the required certificate)

Please note that this site is not Firebase support. Please edit your question and remove all mention of the problem with the Firebase support portal. Please focus on your one main issue regarding push notifications.

@Paulw11 so you are just saying since I am just testing, my APN key that i create in my apple developer account, then push over to firebase, must be a sandbox key?
