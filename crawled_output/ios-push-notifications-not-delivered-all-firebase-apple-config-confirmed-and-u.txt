iOS Firebase Push Notifications Not Delivered — APNs Key, Bundle ID, and Permissions All Set Up (No Errors, No Delivery)
Problem:
I’m unable to receive Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) push notifications on my iOS app, despite confirming all recommended configuration steps and double-checking my setup.
No push notifications are delivered (neither foreground nor background, banner or alert).
No errors appear in Xcode/device logs or Firebase dashboard.
Setup Details
Firebase Project: rise-daily-7cff8
iOS Bundle ID: com.josephmudie.Daily-Bread.dev (identical in Xcode, Firebase, Apple Developer portal, and provisioning profile)
Push enabled:
Apple Developer: Certificates, IDs & Profiles > Identifiers > [App ID] → Push Notifications ON
Xcode: Signing & Capabilities → Push Notifications, Background Modes (Remote notifications) ON
APNs Authentication Key (.p8):
Uploaded to Firebase Console (Cloud Messaging > iOS App Configuration)
Key ID and Team ID confirmed to match Apple Developer account
Only production APNs key uploaded (Firebase doc says this works for both dev/prod builds)
GoogleService-Info.plist:
Downloaded from Firebase and present in Xcode project root
App Code & Registration Logic
AppDelegate.swift:
import UIKit
import Capacitor
import FirebaseCore
import FirebaseMessaging
@UIApplicationMain
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {
var window: UIWindow?
func application(
_ application: UIApplication,
didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions:
[UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?
) -> Bool {
if FirebaseApp.app() == nil {
FirebaseApp.configure()
}
return true
}
func application(_ application: UIApplication,
didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken deviceToken:
Data) {
#i f DEBUG
Messaging.messaging().setAPNSToken(deviceToken, type:
.sandbox)
print("✅ Registered APNs sandbox token (DEBUG build)")
#else
Messaging.messaging().setAPNSToken(deviceToken, type: .prod)
print("✅ Registered APNs prod token (RELEASE build)")
#endif
}
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError error: Error) {
print("❌ Failed to register for remote notifications: (error.localizedDescription)")
Push permission and FCM token registration:
Managed via Capacitor JS (@capacitor/push-notifications)
Permission requested only after login
Latest FCM token is displayed in the logs and copy-pasted directly for Firebase Console testing
UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate is implemented and set
Swizzling is ON (default)
Testing & Results
Tested with real device (iPhone, NOT simulator)
Push permission granted in iOS settings
Latest FCM token used (matches device log)
Sent multiple test notifications from Firebase Console (Notification composer) targeting the device token
No notification delivered (foreground, background, or killed app)
No logs appear in Xcode/device log when test notification sent
What I’ve Tried
All steps in Firebase docs
Revoked and re-uploaded APNs key
Rebuilt/reinstalled app
Confirmed provisioning profile & entitlements
Triple-checked Bundle ID in all locations
What’s Missing / What Am I Overlooking?
Is there anything obvious in my config or code that could prevent APNs delivery?
Are there silent failures or additional debug flags for Firebase iOS push?
Any tools to further debug APNs → device delivery?
Any known issues with using Capacitor and Firebase Messaging on iOS 17+?
Any guidance, even if just how to get any log/error when push fails, would be super appreciated!
Happy to provide any logs, screenshots, or additional config as needed.
Thank you!I’m experiencing a critical issue where iOS push notifications are not being delivered to my app, even though all configuration and checklist items are confirmed to be correct.
Details:
Firebase Project: [rise-daily-7cff8]
iOS Bundle ID: com.josephmudie.Daily-Bread.dev
Push notifications enabled on Apple and in Xcode, using APNs Auth Key (.p8), correctly uploaded to Firebase
Firebase configured in AppDelegate, APNs token passed to FCM (Messaging.messaging().apnsToken = deviceToken)
Push permission/registration handled via Capacitor JS, prompt only after login, latest FCM token always used
UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate is implemented in AppDelegate
Swizzling ON (default), no custom settings
Test notifications from Firebase Console never delivered (no banner, no foreground, no error logs)
No errors in Xcode console or device logs
All troubleshooting steps in Firebase docs confirmed
Request:
Push Issue: Can someone from Firebase help investigate why my iOS app is not receiving push notifications despite all setup being verified?
Any help, escalation, or direct contact would be much appreciated!
Happy to provide screenshots, logs, or more info as needed.
here is my appdelegate code:
import UIKit
import Capacitor
import FirebaseCore
import FirebaseMessaging
@UIApplicationMain
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {
var window: UIWindow?
func application(
_ application: UIApplication,
didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?
) -> Bool {
// Only configure Firebase—do NOT request push permission here!
if FirebaseApp.app() == nil {
FirebaseApp.configure()
}
return true
}
// Handle APNs device token for FCM, with explicit environment
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken deviceToken: Data) {
#if DEBUG
Messaging.messaging().setAPNSToken(deviceToken, type: .sandbox)
print("✅ Registered APNs sandbox token (DEBUG build)")
#else
Messaging.messaging().setAPNSToken(deviceToken, type: .prod)
print("✅ Registered APNs prod token (RELEASE build)")
#endif
}
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError error: Error) {
print("❌ Failed to register for remote notifications: (error.localizedDescription)")
}
}

The first thing to check is that your environments match. If you are using a dev build (ie not from the AppStore), are you using a dev certificate in your firebase configuration. are you testing on a real device. Do you have a paid developer program membership (presumably yes or you wouldn't be able to create the required certificate)

Please note that this site is not Firebase support. Please edit your question and remove all mention of the problem with the Firebase support portal. Please focus on your one main issue regarding push notifications.

@Paulw11 so you are just saying since I am just testing, my APN key that i create in my apple developer account, then push over to firebase, must be a sandbox key?
