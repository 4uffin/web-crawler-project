Life seems easy for picture-perfect couple Ivy (Olivia Colman) and Theo (Benedict Cumberbatch): successful careers, a loving marriage, great kids. But beneath the façade of their supposed ideal life, a storm is brewing -- as Theo's career nosedives while Ivy's own ambitions take off, a tinderbox of fierce competition and hidden resentment ignites. The Roses is a reimagining of the 1989 classic film The War of the Roses, based on the novel by Warren Adler.

The Roses
What to Know
Critics Consensus
The Roses' blend of broad comedy and dark satire makes for an uneasy marriage, although watching Olivia Colman and Benedict Cumberbatch trade barbs is a treat onto itself.

The dazzling script is thespian heaven for the stars, Olivia Colman and Benedict Cumberbatch, who put a wicked British spin on this remake of Danny DeVito’s 1989 movie The War of the Roses...
Rated: 3.5/5

Chicago Reader
The pacing switches too suddenly between vigor and slackness, leaving the film without the propulsion its absurd premise demands, causing the conflict to drag on.

It's a throwback film, the kind they don't make anymore -- and given the sheer amount of Screenwriting 101 cliches that pile up -- you can't help thinking that might be a good thing.

Armond White
National Review
None of the couple’s success, failure, or fame reflects the unsatisfying ups and downs of these times. Roach and McNamara cheat us of understanding ourselves. The Roses plays like a hoax. Hollywood can’t go on making movies like this.

The Roses is a very good movie, but what makes it exceptional are the two leads: Benedict Cumberbatch as Theo and Olivia Coleman as Ivy.

It is like going to a party and ending on a down note. It is so strange to laugh for almost the entire movie then to leave as silent as the grave.

It was entertaining to see these two incredibly talented actors in a comedy! I enjoyed everything about it. The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is because its not an original story. It seems that, these past couple years, original movies are a rarity. However, the acting and writing were excellent (and brilliantly funny)!
