It's interesting and puzzling how the 20th century religious writers like Chesterton, Lewis and Tolkien have become so popular on the tech scene. I'd expected them to die of obsolescence. I like them all, but they all have kind of similar limitations as writers of fiction.replybigstrat2003 0 minutes ago

You expected JRR Tolkien, the founding father of the fantasy genre as we know it, to die of obsolescence? Because if so that was a very badly miscalculated expectation.replyMikhail_Edoshin 8 minutes ago

Long time ago I considered myself atheistic. Then I noticed a strange thing: I liked Chesterton. (Or Graham Greene; also an open Catholic). Why? Why their writings appeared more profound than others'? I couldn't not answer it then, so I just noted that and kept reading. I guess it made me more open. A Buddhist would say it was a good karmic sign.reply
