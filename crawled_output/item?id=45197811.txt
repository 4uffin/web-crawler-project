Orthodoxy by Chesterton is an amazing analysis of why Christianity is so important for any society. https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16769replydash2 15 hours ago

It's interesting and puzzling how the 20th century religious writers like Chesterton, Lewis and Tolkien have become so popular on the tech scene. I'd expected them to die of obsolescence. I like them all, but they all have kind of similar limitations as writers of fiction.replyMikhail_Edoshin 13 hours ago

Long time ago I considered myself atheistic. Then I noticed a strange thing: I liked Chesterton. (Or Graham Greene; also an open Catholic). Why? Why their writings appeared more profound than others'? I couldn't not answer it then, so I just noted that and kept reading. I guess it made me more open. A Buddhist would say it was a good karmic sign.replyflanked-evergl 13 hours ago

You should try reading Chesterton, he wrote better than almost any contemporary writer. Especially his non fiction works. His use of language is masterful.replydash2 12 hours ago

I've never read his non-fiction. I like the Father Brown stories, they're fun, but they are also full of plot holes and retrofitted explanations, and the characters are pretty thin. I feel a bit the same about C. S. Lewis. His non-fiction is brilliant, I love The Inner Ring [1], but his stories don't really have depth. I think it's not surprising that 2 out of the 3 I mentioned had their greatest success with children's books.[1] https://www.lewissociety.org/innerring/replygraemep 11 hours ago

Which CS Lewis fiction have you read? Till We Have Faces is the best IMO and few people seem to read it. I also like Out of The Silent Planet and That Hideous Strength, although not the middle book of that trilogy, Perelandra. The Screwtape Letters and The Great Divorce are pretty good too.I am not sure Tolkien's books are accurately described as children's books. The Hobbit perhaps, but not the Lord of The Rings IMO.replydash2 10 hours ago

I started That Hideous Strength but did not get far. I'll put the others on my list!replybigstrat2003 13 hours ago

You expected JRR Tolkien, the founding father of the fantasy genre as we know it, to die of obsolescence? Because if so that was a very badly miscalculated expectation.replydash2 12 hours ago

I didn't think fantasy was an important genre, and actually, I still don't. I like Ursula Le Guin. George Martin is incredibly well-written, but it's not literature.replyAfterHIA 4 hours ago

As a committed Christian Atheist I'm prepared to devour anything from the prophet.reply
