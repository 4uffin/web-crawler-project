Happening now
• The 77th Primetime Emmy Awards: The Emmys are recognizing the best of television tonight in Los Angeles.
• Big winners: Seth Rogen’s comedy series skewering Hollywood execs, “The Studio,” is on a roll, taking home three Emmys, including an acting nod for Rogen. In the drama categories, we’re watching the evolving race between “Severance” and “The Pitt.”
• Speeches on the clock: Host Nate Bargatze challenged winners to keep acceptance speeches under 45 seconds, or else he’ll reduce a $100,000 donation to the Boys & Girls Club. An on-screen counter has showed the total falling for violations, though some speakers have vowed to make up the difference. Attendees have also used their platform to speak out in protest.

Television Academy chair speaks out on Congress defunding CPB
From CNN's Maureen Chowdhury

Chair of the Television Academy President Cris Abrego spoke on the Emmys stage regarding the Corporation for Public Broadcasting’s plans to shut down after Congress cut funding earlier this year.
Abrego began his remarks by noting that last week, he presented the Creative Emmys Governor’s Award to the CPB, which was met with a loud round of applause.
He then went on to say that CPB will be closing its doors at the end of the year because Congress “has voted to defund it and silence yet another cultural institution.” The crowd responded with loud “boos” and audible disapproval.
Abrego said that the move is a reminder of “just how much our work here matters, especially right now. At a time when division dominates the headlines, storytelling still has the power to unite us. Television and the artists who make it do more than reflect society, they shape our culture. And at times of cultural regression, they remind us what’s at stake and what can still be achieved.”
More on the cuts: CPB announced last month that it will wind down its operations due to the successful Republican effort to defund local PBS and NPR stations across the country.
The announcement came just over a week after President Donald Trump enacted a rescissions bill clawing back congressionally approved federal funds for public media and foreign aid. Of the $9 billion in canceled funds, $1.1 billion was earmarked for the CPB for the next two years.

And "Adolescence" wins again, with Erin Doherty taking home best supporting actress award

Erin Doherty took home the Emmy for best supporting actress in a limited or anthology series for her portrayal of the child psychologist Briony Ariston in “Adolescence.”
She dedicated her win to her older sister, who she said she “wouldn’t be here without.”
About the show: The unnerving Netflix series explores the disconnect between the lack of awareness of parents and what kids are being exposed to on social media. It starts out as a crime drama, but over the course of four episodes it explores what exactly could have possessed such an innocent-looking boy to allegedly commit murder.

Cristin Milioti wins her first Emmy for her work in "The Penguin"

Cristin Milioti has won outstanding lead actress in a limited series for her role in “The Penguin.”
“I’m so profoundly grateful,” Milioti said while accepting her award.
She said she wrote her acceptance speech on the back of notes from a recent therapy session.
“So don’t look at the back,” she said, to which the audience laughed.
Milioti, who plays the fierce and dangerous Sophia Falcone in the HBO Max series, thanked the show’s cast and crew as well as her family and friends.
“I loved making this show and I loved playing Sophia so much,” she said. “Getting to inhabit this woman was a bright spot for me despite it being very grisly. Playing her felt like flying.”
About the show: “The Penguin” is a hard-boiled look at the gritty criminal underbelly of the Gotham City presented in Matt Reeves’ “The Batman,” and puts actor Colin Farrell’s morally bankrupt villain Oz Cobb at the center.
HBO Max and CNN are both owned by parent company Warner Bros. Discovery.

Lorne Michaels wins 24th Emmy for outstanding live variety special for "SNL50"

Lorne Michaels has won the Emmy for outstanding live variety special for “SNL50: The Anniversary Special.”
Michaels is noted as having the most Emmy nominations for an individual, primarily for producing “Saturday Night Live”.
He has been nominated for an Emmy
a whopping 112 times, and has now won 24 times.
He was presented the award on Sunday by former “Saturday Night Live” cast member and protégée Tina Fey.
“When I won this award for the first time 50 years ago, in 1975, I was younger and I had a lot of dreams about what would happen in my life — and not one of those dreams was that I’d be doing the same show for next 50 years. However, here we are,” Michaels, 80, said during his acceptance speech.

Inside the room: The speech timer is a hit, and commercial breaks get a soundtrack
From CNN's Tori B. Powell
Host Nate Bargatze speaks on stage.

For those keeping track at home, the Boys & Girls Club donation counter stands at $99,000.
Host Nate Bargatze’s stunt — in which he’s reducing the donation by $1,000 for every second a winner goes over 45 seconds in their acceptance speech — has been going over really well with the stars inside the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles, according to CNN’s Elizabeth Wagmeister, who’s inside the show. If winners keep their speeches short, money is added back to the donation pot per every second under 45 seconds.
It’s such a hit that people at the award show are trying to make their speeches extra short, Wagmeister reports. That includes “The Studio” crew, who helped raise the number back to nearly its original total, $100,000, by giving an extremely abbreviated address for their last win. John Oliver also kept things extra brief for the same reason.
More from inside the room: Ever wonder what happens during commercial breaks at the Emmy Awards?
Well, this year songs from popular television shows like “Law & Order,” “Will and Grace” and “Different Strokes” as well as clips from previous Emmys broadcasts are playing in the theater when the award ceremony goes off the air, according to Wagmeister. That’s also been contributing to the fun vibe inside.

We have missed you, "Gilmore Girls!"

Thanks to the Emmys, we don’t have to wait for the reportedly planned “Gilmore Girls” documentary to get a fix of our “coffee, coffee, coffee.”
The awards show presented a set reveal with “Gilmore Girls” stars Alexis Bledel and Lauren Graham on Sunday night.
The pair joked about the limited budget of their beloved show when it was on the air while presenting the award for outstanding writing for a comedy series.
“We saved up all year long to have one snow episode,” Bledel said during the presentation.
“Then ER would wet down their street and wash it all away,” Graham joked.
The award they presented was won by the writing team for “The Studio,” which included Seth Rogen notching his third win of the night.
Fans fell in love with Graham as single mom Lorelai Gilmore and her teen daughter Rory, played by Bledel, making a life for themselves in the fictional town of Stars Hollow, Connecticut on the beloved series, which ran from 2000 to 2007.

Cooper won for “Adolescence” and is the youngest nominee in the best supporting actor, limited/anthology series or TV movie category.
At 15, he is the youngest male winner of any acting Emmy ever, according to the TV Academy.
Cooper said he started taking drama classes just a few years ago.
“I think tonight proves that if you listen and you focus and you step out your comfort zone, you can achieve anything in life,” he said while accepting his award. “I was nothing about three years ago. I’m here now.”
About the show: The British miniseries “Adolescence” on Netflix, filmed as one continuous shot, starts out as a crime drama, but over the course of four episodes explores what exactly could have possessed such an innocent-looking boy to allegedly commit murder.
The answers it comes up with aren’t so simple.
Another win: “Adolescence” also took home the Emmy for outstanding writing for a limited or anthology series or movie.

"Survivor" host Jeff Probst did double duty at the Emmys

No one would have been shocked if Jeff Probst got emotional at the Emmys.
After all, he got teary-eyed during an episode of “Survivor” in March when one contestant, who has autism, was lovingly helped by another.
The Emmys are celebrating a milestone in the reality competition’s history, which began back in 2000, to mark the show’s upcoming 50th season.
Probst used the tribute to announce the outstanding scripted variety show award, which was between two “tribes”: “Saturday Night Live” and “Last Week Tonight With John Oliver.”
Oliver won.
Later this month, “Survivor” – which has won seven Primetime Emmys before tonight in its run – will premiere its 49th season, ahead of next spring’s 50th, which will feature returning finalist and Emmy-winning writer-director Mike White of “White Lotus” fame.

“Thanks so much. This is an honor,” he said.
“Slow Horses” — which features Gary Oldman, Jack Lowden, Rosalind Eleazar and Kristin Scott Thomas — brings espionage to the small screen. The Apple TV+ show, created and written by Will Smith, follows a team of agents in the UK as they try to protect the country from danger.

Tramell Tillman has won the Emmy for outstanding supporting actor in a drama series, becoming the first Black actor to do so.
Tillman stars in “Severance,” which entered the night with more nominations than any other show.
“You remember what you want to remember. You make time for what you want to make time for. Do the work. Show up and most importantly, for the love of God, don’t embarrass me in public. My first acting coach was tough y’all. But all great mothers are,” Tillman said as the audience collectively said “aww” and
applauded the gesture.
“Momma, you were there for me when no one else was and no one else would show up. Your loving kindness stays with me. And this is for you,” he said.
Tillman went on to thank the Television Academy.
This is his first Emmy win and nomination.

Jeff Hiller is taking home the Emmy for outstanding supporting actor in a comedy series for his work in HBO Max’s “Somebody Somewhere.”
He thanked his family, the show’s writers for creating a series “about connecting and love in this time when compassion is seen as weakness,” as well as the show’s star, comedian and actress Bridget Everett.
On the ground: CNN’s Elizabeth Wagmeister, who is in the Peacock Theater right now, said the room is stunned at Hiller’s win. The iconic Harrison Ford was nominated in the same category — which was his first Emmy nomination and would have been his first win in his decades-long career.

Not even an hour into the show and the Emmys host is still thinking about the money.
Putting his wallet where his mouth is has Nate Bargatze paying attention to the counter for acceptance speeches, and he wanted to be clear that “Hacks” star Hannah Einbinder – who won her first Emmy, for outstanding supporting actress in a comedy – offered to pay the difference after she went over the allotted 45 seconds.
She also swore, saying “f**k ICE,” and Bargatze offered, “I will start a swear jar.”

Hannah Einbinder has won a best supporting actress Emmy for her work in the comedy “Hacks.”
Einbinder, who was wearing a Palestine pin, ended her speech by saying, “Free Palestine!” Her remarks come as Israel faces growing global outcry over its intensifying assault on Gaza City. We’ve seen other stars wearing pins and making comments of protest against the war in Gaza at tonight’s awards.
She also spoke out against the Trump administration’s ongoing immigration crackdown, saying, “F**k ICE,” in a comment that was partially muted on the broadcast.
As Einbinder’s acceptance speech surpassed the 45-second time limit, she promised she would “pay the difference” to the Boys and Girls Club.
Her comments on the win: Einbinder thanked the creators of “Hacks” for giving her the opportunity and for “changing my life in every conceivable way.”
Einbinder also thanked co-star Jean Smart, who she described is “like the sun and I just get to stand in her warmth” as well as the rest of the cast and crew of “Hacks.”
This was Einbinder’s first Emmy win for the show, although she’s been previously nominated for her role as Ava Daniels. Smart won in the lead comedy actress category before her.

Thank you for being a friend, Reba McEntire, Karen Fairchild and Kimberly Schlapman.
The trio traveled down the road and back again to sing the famed “Golden Girls” theme song in honor of the hit comedy’s 40th anniversary on a recreation of the show’s famous kitchen set.
It was so much fun watching members of the audience – including Emmy nominee Colin Farrell – bop and sing along.
Bea Arthur, Betty White, Rue McClanahan and Estelle Getty starred as four older women living together in this beloved series that ran from 1985 to 1992, winning 11 Primetime Emmys along the way.
Tonight’s trio of singers not only used the moment to pay tribute to the show, but also to present the award for best supporting actress in a comedy, which was fitting.
The song – originally written by Andrew Gold and released in 1978 before the Cynthia Fee cover version became the show’s iconic theme – is a tune that keeps on giving, in part for going viral again in 2020.

Something to look out for tonight: The race between "The Pitt" and "Severance"
From CNN's Elizabeth Wagmeister and Matt Meyer
Katherine LaNasa is embraced by co-star Noah Wyle as she wins best supporting actress in a drama series for "The Pitt."
Mike Blake/Reuters
Katherine LaNasa winning best supporting actress in a drama may bode well for medical drama “The Pitt.”
She was not widely considered a lock for the category, so this could be a positive sign for co-star Noah Wyle, who is nominated in the outstanding lead actor in a drama category.
It could be shaping into a two-man race between Adam Scott of “Severance” and Wyle in that category.
“The Pitt” and “Severance” are also going head-to-head for the best drama award. That’s probably the biggest matchup of the night.
“The Pitt” is coming into the show with momentum, given its strong showing at the Creative Arts Emmys.

“Severance” has notched another win, this time in the outstanding lead actress in a drama category, which went to star Britt Lower.
“It’s a privilege to even be mentioned alongside such an incredible group of artists. Wow,” she said while accepting her award.
This is Lower’s first Emmy nomination and win, according to the Television Academy. She thanked fans, her “heroic cast and crew,” her team, her fellow nominees and family.
“Severance,” created by Dan Erickson, is a dystopian workplace series in which employees sign away all rights to their 9-to-5 brains. It leads tonight’s nominees with 27 nods.

We went back-to-back with the comedy lead awards: Jean Smart has won for her work in “Hacks.”
“You know one of the best things about winning something like this is that you actually get to publicly thank the people you work with,” Smart said in her remarks.
She went on to thank fellow star of “Hacks” Hannah Einbinder as well as the rest of the cast and crew.
Smart also thanked her children who she said were her “anchor.”
She ended her speech by saying, “Everybody let’s be good to each other.”
Smart plays feisty comedienne-turned-late night host Deborah Vance in the award-winning series, while Einbinder portrays the up-and-coming comedy writer Ava Daniels.
Tonight’s win was Smart’s fourth for “Hacks.”
“Hacks” is an HBO Max show. HBO Max is owned by CNN’s parent company.
