Sep 10, 2025
Weâve all been there â stuck in back-to-back meetings that couldâve been handled in a simple Slack message, dealing with cranky customers, feeling our souls slowly leave our bodies when we hear the word "bandwidth."
Thankfully, television has often managed to turn our work pain into catharsis through comedies and dramas that are as satisfying as your paycheck hitting your bank account on the first Friday of the month.
From shows with crushing career pressure, like "The Pitt," or sitcoms about the kind of colleagues who make Mondays tolerable, like "Abbott Elementary,â CNN teamed up with Rotten Tomatoes to select 25 exceptional TV series from the past 25 years that prove workplaces are the ultimate backdrop for compelling stories.
The series are presented in an order reflective of their Tomatometer scores. In cases of a tie, the audience Popcornmeter scores were factored in.
These are TV shows that more than got the job done. They managed to make workâ¦ entertaining.

Abbott Elementary
2021-present
From the brain of creator and star Quinta Brunson, âAbbott Elementaryâ has been showing us the highs and lows of the public education system for going on five seasons now. What makes âAbbottâ so special is how it takes the typical elements of the sitcom and the workplace comedy and blends them with a message: Teachers put up with a lot! The school staff may have problems and hijinks, but they put that aside as much as they can to educate the next generation. The sitcom casts an eye on the significance of teachers, even when theyâre doing something utterly hilarious.

âIt all started when Gregory first got to the school and I gave him a tour. I thought, âThis is somebody I could get to know.â And then I thought, âMaybe a friendship with this guy.â And then I thought, âHe's kind of cute, but he's my colleague.â So, you know, at this point, you would think I would go forward in the story, but I actually probably need to go back a few years, um, to 11th grade, when I finally hit puberty.â

Warner Bros. Television
âPilotâ
Season 1, Episode 1, December 2021
A series that is a love letter to educators also shows love to students. In this pitch-perfect pilot, Janine, in a cash-strapped school district, gets a new rug for her kindergarten classroom, with the help of her fellow teachers.
âWinter Breakâ
Season 4, Episode 8, December 2024
This holiday episode showcases the love these teachers have for each other. Jacob worries heâs discovered a dead relative at Melissaâs hilarious Christmas dinner, while Ava crashes Janine and Gregoryâs cozy first holiday as a couple â dressed in matching winter onesies, of course.
âDistrict Budget Meetingâ
Season 4, Episode 14, February 2025
After a satisfying slow burn, Janine and Gregory are now a couple. A garbled voice note from Gregory while on a smoothie run leaves Janine thinking â but not quite sure â he said âI love youâ for the first time. Gregory realizes he did, in fact, accidentally say the âLâ word. Itâs how he feels. Janine records a voice note to say she loves him, too.
Younger
2015-2021
Very rarely does a workplace dramedy like âYoungerâ come around, showing how challenging it is to find and keep the career of your dreams in New York City. Younger hits all the relatable beats, speaking volumes about what transition post-divorce looks like. Liza lies on her job application to secure her ideal job, knowing she possesses the necessary skills but lacks the years of experience â sound familiar? But a mid-life crisis is not complete until you have an entanglement, and Josh, the much younger, hot, and charming tattoo artist, and Charles, her attractive, book-loving boss, provide more than Liza bargained for. Lizaâs new career sees her trauma-bonding with Kelsey, her work bestie turned family, over their mutual frustrations with Diana, the villainous boss who ends up having a heart after all. While the personal and professional ramifications of Lizaâs lies leave a trail of broken hearts, she ultimately finds herself, her voice, and dominates in publishing.

Thereâs a lot to love about this scene-setting pilot that hooks you from the words âStarring Sutton Foster.
âShedonismâ
Season 1, Episode 6, April 2015
A guest appearance from Jane Krakowski as a difficult author pumps up the comedy in this wild episode.
âSecrets and Lizaâ
Season 2, Episode 1, March 2016
âYoungerâsâ parody of âGame of Thrones,â âCrown of Kings,â is introduced in this episode that has secrets being revealed and a shocking death that would have even Westeros shook.
Ugly Betty
2006-2010
âUgly Bettyâ holds a special place in my heart as it was one of the first shows that truly made me feel seen on screen. America Ferrera played Betty Suarez, a smart and ambitious Latina trying to make it in the cutthroat world of fashion publishing. Though she doesnât fit the mold, Betty stays true to herself as she blossoms to become the confident woman sheâs meant to be over the course of four seasons. Despite telenovela-style twists and rivalries, Mode Magazine becomes more than just a workplace. Itâs a found family, and itâs all thanks to Bettyâs endless optimism. âUgly Bettyâ has used its incredible humor, compassion, and authentic representation to pave the way for more shows with diverse voices like âJane The Virginâ and âThe Bold Type.â

âSecretariesâ Dayâ
Season 1, Episode 21, May 2007
Whatâs not to love about an episode that has a medieval-themed restaurant and Daniel showing up for Betty in the way she deserves?
âHow Betty Got Her Grieve Backâ
Season 2, Episode 1, September 2007
Itâs one of those episodes that you canât really experience the same way you did the first time you watched it.
âHello Goodbyeâ
Season 4, Episode 19, April 2010
Goodbyes are tough, but the show sets up a bright future for Betty Suarez in this wedding episode that sees Hilda marrying Bobby.
Mythic Quest
2020-2025
âMythic Questâ is a defining workplace show that not-so-subtly nails the nuances of gaming and geek fandom while perfectly balancing comedy and societal awareness. Leaning into its dysfunction and quirkiness, âMythic Questâ uses the narcissistic, mansplaining tendencies of virtually every man who works there to highlight the challenges their brilliant women colleagues face daily, utilizing their tools, ideas, wit, and answers to solve 90% of the problems they didnât create. A gem that darkens its tone via backstories that tie into the chaos of the present-day storyline, âMythic Questâ doesnât pretend to be anything other than what it is. Even with a controversial will-they-wonât-they storyline between Poppy and Ian that left half the fans wanting more and the other half wanting platonic friendships to still exist in the workplace, you can tell itâs a show created by friends who wanted to have fun and lean into the absurdity of the male-dominated gaming industry.

Brooklyn Nine-Nine
2013-2021
While Brooklyn Nine-Nine has all the hallmarks of a great workplace comedy, the thing that makes it stand out is the mentor relationship that Jake has with Holt. Throughout the show, the two characters slowly grow to respect one another and develop a close relationship that goes beyond just work and even turns paternal at times. It's safe to say that we all wish we had a Captain Holt in our lives, even if it means we're constantly being addressed in a stone-cold deadpan.

Succession
2018-2023
âSuccessionâ made life inside the C-suite of major media conglomerates appear as dark as we fear. Between the backstabbing, intoxicating power, insatiable fighting and family dysfunction that would make any therapist throw in the towel â we couldn't wait for the backstory that broke the news! It was as unpredictable as real life and made us rethink the audience as the story.

The Pitt
2025-present
For âThe Pitt,â Scott Gemmill, John C. Wells, and Noah Wyle set out to make the most accurate medical drama on TV, and they did so with surgical attention to detail and a stellar cast. The miracle of âThe Pittâ is that, while we watch Wyle's Dr. Robby endure one of the worst days of his life as every bad decision and buried demon resurfaces, we are also gifted a new high-water mark for an ensemble performance. Amid the relentlessness of one shift on a hellish day in a Pittsburgh emergency room is a brilliant workplace drama as intimate as it is realistic, filled with characters you can't help but watch and fall in love with.

An episode with equal parts high-intensity medical crises and heartbreak sees the ER responding to a mass casualty event and Dr. Robby reeling from past - and very present - trauma.
Severance
2022-present
Iâm sure we all wish we were better at establishing a work-life balance, right? Apple TV+ brings a whole new meaning to that concept in their hit series âSeverance.â At Lumon Industries, office workers have had their minds surgically altered to separate their work lives and their personal lives. It may sound like a dreamâ¦ until the reality sets in. Being âseveredâ causes deep identity struggles as each employee now has two personas: âinnies,â who exist only inside Lumon to perform mysterious tasks, and âouties,â their original selves outside of work. This chilling premise is a powerful metaphor for corporate life and the struggle to balance work and play. Through a dystopian sci-fi lens, the characters begin to question their identities, the peculiar work theyâre doing, how much the company controls their lives and how our jobs define us. While itâs an extreme example, it forces us as viewers to look at our own workplace experiences and how they impact us.

Mad Men
2007-2015
Given how often Don Draper played hooky, it's easy to forget that âMad Menâ was also the story of his job, a 1960s ad agency transformed by the blowing winds of countercultural transition. Matthew Weiner's watershed period piece didn't just track a few dozen vividly sketched characters over seven seasons and an eventful decade, showing how they changed (or refused to; paging the incorrigible Roger Sterling!) alongside an America rocked by rock music, Vietnam, and the Civil Rights movement. It also traced the ups and downs of a company with nearly as many names on the door as clients in the books. If the salacious hook of the show was Don's extracurricular (and extramarital) affairs, Weiner found plenty of drama in deadlines, pitches, mergers, bull sessions, and office politics, too â the normal business of Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce, or whatever it was calling itself as the â70s hangover loomed.

Don and Peggy pull an all-nighter working on the Samsonite account and unpack years of emotional baggage.
Silicon Valley
2014-2019
âSilicon Valleyâ is one of the few shows that successfully balances broad comedy with brutal accuracy. The tech figureheads it parodied seemed too ridiculous to be believed until creator Mike Judge started talking openly about how much the tech industry wrote the show for them. The characters played by Thomas Middleditch, T.J. Miller, Martin Starr, Kumail Nanjiani, and Zach Woods may have been archetypes of friends trying to make it big in Silicon Valley, but that is not what got folks to tune in. It was their friendship and underdog status that made them so endearing. Yes, they were awkward and often said the wrong things, jumping from bad scenarios to worse ones, but they always figured it out in the end. The guys everyone else counted out - the nerds - somehow found a way to make good. And despite their missteps, we couldnât help but root for them because they were typically surrounded by figures who were invariably worse.

Party Down
2009-2023
What's a workplace sitcom without the workplace? This prematurely canceled, triumphantly revived catering comedy switched up âthe whereâ every week, following as it did a staff of food-service flunkies from one absurd SoCal gig to the next. It was the who (a gutbusting ensemble that included Lizzie Caplan, Martin Starr, Ken Marino, and Jane Lynch) that kept us clocking in, just as the right colleagues can make almost any job worth keeping. Beyond the steady laughs, âParty Downâ had a lot to say about holding on to a calling while working a lousy job to pay the bills. And in its recent, unlikely revival, the show pushed beyond wish-fulfillment to a bigger truth for aging, aspiring actor Henry (Adam Scott): Sometimes you have to know when to be happy where you landed instead of bitter about where you didn't.

Featuring some delicious cameos, including Christopher Mintz-Plasse at his 'McLovin' nerdiest, the late great Lupe Ontiveros and Guttenberg himself, this party really went places, including faraway galaxies with a surprisingly arresting script reading of Roman and Kent's epic sci-fi project.
"Constance Carmell Wedding"

There's something downright inspiring watching Constance â one of the most carefree characters ever to exist on television â somehow end up hitched to an old man who will one day make her a filthy rich heiress. Plus, we get to experience Kyle's misguided but killer vocals in a tribute to the plucky bride.
"KSGY-95 Prizewinner's Luau"
Season 3, Episode 4, May 2023
The PD gang gets weird on magic mushrooms at a laid-back luau in Malibu, and it's really tough to pick who is most gleeful to watch tripping their faces off â we'll just say it's a toss-up between Evie and Sackson, with everyone else as runners-up.
Itâs Always Sunny in Philadelphia
2005-present
A few friends hanging out in a bar â groundbreaking. But cheers to the team at âItâs Always Sunny in Philadelphia,â who knew the timeless TV concept still had uncharted ground. Twenty years after its debut and 17 seasons in, the gang inside Paddyâs Pub (Rob McElhenney, Charlie Day, Glenn Howerton, Kaitlin Olson and Danny DeVito) hold a TV record as the longest-running live-action US sitcom. More importantly, the show â at many times so delightfully ridiculous that it feels like youâre watching human cartoons â has entered into pop culture history a show that is almost a language of its own and if you have the ability to speak it, youâre sticking around until closing time.

Veep
2012-2019
âVeepâsâ unflinching portrayal of incompetence in policymaking and politicking pushed the boundaries of satire until actual government dysfunction seemed to surpass the showâs absurdity. Starring Julia Louis Dreyfus as toxic-boss-in-chief/Vice President (and briefly President) Selina Meyer, âVeepâ made precision verbal brutality a comedic high art. There are no âWest Wingâ romantic notions of governance in this series, just workplace chaos with egos, ambition and a laugh-or-youâll-cry look at politics.

Superstore
2015-2021
No doubt angling for another âOffice,â NBC ordered up its spiritual successor: a clock-puncher sitcom about the kooky employees of a Midwestern big-box store. Viewers never flocked to Cloud 9 at the volume they visited Dunder Mifflin, despite a will-they-won't-they (between Ben Feldman's endearingly pretentious Jonah and America Ferrera's harried supervisor Amy) to rival Jim and Pam's. But maybe modest success suited the underdog ethos of âSuperstore,â which perfectly captured the quotidian grind of a customer-facing corporate job, as well as the commiserative pleasures of spending a shift goofing off with coworkers. By the end of six consistently funny seasons, it had quietly, and without preaching, become the most pro-labor show on TV, its sympathies reserved for workers underpaid, essential, and undocumented alike.

âThe Bearâ initially started out as a series where the real star was the fantastic food that Chef Carmen âCarmyâ Berzatto (Jeremy Allen White) was making every episode. But itâs transitioned into a series about generational trauma, perseverance, and, yes, still ogling the amazing food. Itâs a celebration of finding joy and belonging in oneâs work and attempting to find a happy medium between a job and career. And, cannot stress this enough, the food.

Season 2, Episode 6, June 2023
Emotions run high in a flashback episode to a âFeast of the Seven Fishesâ dinner with the Berzatto family. Unless your holidays also include chain-smoking, screaming and your mom crashing a car in your living room, it will give you more than a few reasons to be thankful for your own personal family recipe of dysfunction.
âThe Bearâ
Season 2, Episode 10, June 2023
Opening night of the newly renovated restaurant sees a triumphant âfriends and familyâ service in the dining room and chaos in the kitchen as the staff navigate pressures, personal demons and Chef Carmy getting locked in the walk-in fridge.
Parks and Recreation
2009-2015
The highlight of a good office comedy is the variety of characters that come with it. From the upbeat go-getter to the curmudgeon who's only there for a paycheck, it's impossible to look at âParks and Recreationâ and not feel like it just resonates. Whether it's Ron happily avoiding all meetings (until April accidentally schedules them all on one day) or the staff partying with each other outside of work for something like Galentine's Day, there's always something to connect to. With bureaucracy stymying swift progress, it's immensely entertaining to watch as characters struggle through the same monotony that can often plague an office job without losing the humor of life.

âGalentineâs Dayâ
Season 2, Episode 16, February 2010
At her core, Leslie Knope was the friend we all want and need. Nothing highlights this better than this episode. She throws a Valentineâs Day-adjacent celebration for the women who mean the most to her, with a side serving of Ron advice that reminds you of his special bond with his No. 1 Knope.
âHarvest Festivalâ/âLil Sebastianâ
Season 3, Episode 7/Episode 16, March and May 2011
Weâre going to call this pair of hijinks-packed episodes a double feature because who knew a tiny horseâs disappearance and eventual demise could be such an amazing vehicle for comedy? When even the horse is a great actor, you know you have a stellar ensemble.
âAndy and Aprilâs Fancy Partyâ
Season 3, Episode 9, April 2011
âParks and Recâ did weddings well, but this off-beat celebration of the romance no one saw coming was hilarious, warm and like the show itself, a tribute to found family.
Ted Lasso
2020-2023
âTed Lassoâ arrived at the perfect time. In a moment of global uncertainty and fear, this thoughtful, funny and emotionally raw show was exactly what I needed. âTed Lassoâ was â and is â a reminder that we are at our best when we challenge ourselves, embrace our vulnerabilities and care for one another. I love that my younger son identified most with Sam, connecting with the characterâs kind heart and strong convictions. There is such beauty in Royâs gruff exterior and liberal F bombs wrapping a character who loves so deeply. While Tedâs folksy observations, relatable struggles and his growth get much of the attention, the strong women who serve as the backbone of this ensemble regularly had me cheering. âTed Lassoâ is a timeless reminder of the strength to be found in a teamâ¦ a team that is at its best when it is diverse, open and curious.

The White Lotus
2021-present
One of the most thankless jobs in the world is working in hospitality. Itâs even worse if you have to deal with people day and night, and nothing is quite as bad as working at a resort where the privileged guests not only expect to be waited on hand and foot, but also essentially look right through you. And while the kooky guests of âThe White Lotusâ might be the stars of the show, it's hard not to feel a kinship to the regular people working behind the scenes who have to scramble to keep the resorts afloat. We can forgive them for being a little messy, look at the people they have to deal with!

"You have to treat these people like sensitive children. They always say it's about the money, but it's not. It's not even about the room. They just need to feel seen.

Industry
2020-present
It is unique to have a workplace drama that boldly exposes the corporate toxicity, classism, racism, sexism and employee burnout in the way that âIndustryâ does. It is a shockingly honest and unfiltered look into the high-stakes world of investment banking through the lens of Pierpoint & Co. While having worked in a variety of high-stress industries, seeing Harper navigate frequent microaggressions and her capabilities constantly being questioned hit eerily too close to home for me as a Black woman. Now, donât get me wrong â there are no angels in âIndustry,â and everyone is flawed, utterly human, and oftentimes put in impossible circumstances. The choices the employees face, the long nights at the office, the manipulation, and the backstabbing â while Pierpoint & Co. is the fictionalized company of nightmares for some viewers, for others, it is a triggering look back at a time they never want to revisit.

The characters go to new extremes with a major merger for Pierpoint and careers at a crossroads.
Reno 911!
2003-2009, 2020-2022
Among the first - and most hilarious - workplace mockumentary series of the last 25 years, "Reno 911!" didn't just parody "Cops," it set a template for workplace dysfunction comedies. Set in "The Biggest Little City in the World," the series became a playground for over-the-top characters and the masters of improv, such as Thomas Lennon and Niecy Nash, who played them. The deeply-flawed but loveable deputies of "Reno 911!" are as incompetent as the troublemakers they encounter. The showâs systemic critique of authority, wrapped in absurdist humor, still holds up.

Scrubs
2001-2010
Long before âTed Lassoâ was playing with your emotions like they were a ball being bullied up and down the pitch during a World Cup final, âScrubsâ was skillfully operating in the now ubiquitous âwhy is this comedy making me cry?â genre. Led by Zach Braff as Dr. JD Dorian, Donald Faison as Dr. Christopher Turk and Sarah Chalke as Dr. Elliot Reid, the show had a way of hitting all notes â funny, fantastical, playful, poignant and everything in between â with surgical precision. Thereâs a reason it will soon be joining the ranks of the rebooted: Comedy that dares us to feel has a way of living on.

The Office
2005-2013
âThe Officeâ has become the ultimate blueprint for workplace comedies. Set at a paper company called Dunder-Mifflin, it uses a mockumentary-style format to follow its quirky staff. What sets âThe Officeâ apart is the way it highlights the absurdities of everyday office life. We can all relate to having a ridiculous boss or co-workers we spend more time with than our own families. It has this rare ability to make the small, mundane moments absolutely hilarious. You canât help but fall in love with this dysfunctional crew, which is why it's such a comforting show that people love to watch over and over again. With nine seasons of humor and goofy workplace antics, itâs no surprise that âThe Officeâ has had a lasting impact on pop culture. In fact, the show worked so well, theyâre doing it all over again as the same team brings us âThe Paper.â

30 Rock
2006-2013
As showrunner of a long-running (albeit critically middling and frequently ratings-challenged) comedy series, Tina Feyâs Liz Lemon would seem, by any measure, to be a professional success. But Liz is no role model and hers is no dream gig, even if she does get to work with her best friend, narcissistic star actress Jenna (Jane Krakowski), and a genuinely invested mentor, Reagan-worshipping exec Jack (Alec Baldwin). The TGS offices are a chaotic mess of petty grudges and outlandish schemes, unruly scribes and scheming suits. On any given day, we might find Jenna wooing an inbred prince, or Kenneth (Jack McBrayer) pulling out all the stops for Leap Day William, or Tracy (Tracy Morgan) trying to bond with a âsonâ whoâs older than he is. Yet if the joke-a-minute plots and instantly memorable one-liners are too heightened to be relatable, the wry exhaustion underneath it all, from dealing every day with impossible coworkers, unreasonable bosses and other miscellaneous bits of bullshit, might be.

Characters are always the number one reason why viewers connect with shows. And on "The Morning Show," we've given our characters a glamorous, but also riotous, work environment to play in. As a producer of the drama, I once told the writers to think of morning TV as a battle for control â from the open-plan newsroom to the anything-can-happen studio to the control room. Power struggles happen in every office, and on this show, they're sometimes even televised for the world to see.
