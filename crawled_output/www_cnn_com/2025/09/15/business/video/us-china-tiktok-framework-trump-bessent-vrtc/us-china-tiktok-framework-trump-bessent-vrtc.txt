Bessent: Framework for TikTok deal reached
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says the US and China have agreed to a framework for a deal on TikTok. A bipartisan bill passed by Congress and signed by former President Joe Biden banned TikTok in the United States unless its China-based owner divested its stake in the company. President Trump has delayed the implementation of that law several times while he sought a US buyer for TikTok.
