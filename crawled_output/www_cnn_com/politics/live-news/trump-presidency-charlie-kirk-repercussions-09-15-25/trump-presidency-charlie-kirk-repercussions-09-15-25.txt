Suspect in Kirk killing wrote a note saying he had an opportunity to take out activist, FBI director says

The suspect in last week’s killing of Charlie Kirk wrote that he had the “opportunity to take out” the conservative influencer, and “I’m going to take it,” FBI Director Kash Patel said today.
The message was written prior to Wednesday’s shooting, Patel told Fox News. It’s unclear which form the message took; Patel described it as both a “note” and a “text message exchange.” He said the writing had since been “destroyed” but was recovered by investigators.
Patel did not share the full text of the message.
Patel’s interview with Fox is highly unusual, as FBI officials and Justice Department prosecutors generally avoid giving investigative details in a case that will be prosecuted for fear that it could damage the case.
Patel also said that DNA recovered from a screwdriver and towel which were both found with the gun used in Kirk’s killing were matched for the suspect in the assassination, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson.
Robinson’s family, Patel said, told investigators that Robinson had “subscribed to left-wing ideology.” Patel did not provide specifics on what that ideology included.
Robinson’s family, Patel said, told investigators that Robinson had “subscribed to left-wing ideology.”
Patel defended his agency’s role in the shooting amid mounting questions over his handling of the case and his leadership of the FBI. Bureau employees previously told CNN they were frustrated with how Patel led the investigation.

Qatari and US officials had serious discussions about security partnership after Israeli strike, diplomat says
From CNN's
Mostafa Salem in Doha
Qatari and US
officials had “serious discussions” about the two countries’ bilateral security and defense partnership after Israel targeted Hamas officials in an airstrike in Doha last week, a diplomat with knowledge of the discussions told CNN.
The discussions also included Qatar’s potential purchase of more advanced US defense equipment, the diplomat said.
Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani visited the White House and had dinner with US President Donald Trump on Friday, three days after the Israeli strike.
Trump has said publicly that he was “very unhappy about every aspect” of the Israeli attack.
Arab and Muslim leaders are meeting in Qatar today to discuss a response to last week’s Israeli strike. The diplomat said that Gulf Arab nations are in advanced discussions to solidify their collective military defense.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio will visit the Qatari capital Doha tomorrow following a visit to Israel, the diplomat told CNN earlier.

If you’re just joining us, we’re covering political developments in Washington, DC and beyond.
Here’s what to watch so far this morning:
Charlie Kirk: Vice President JD Vance said that he will host the “Charlie Kirk Show” podcast at noon today. Meanwhile, FBI Director Kash Patel provided new details about a note written by the suspect in Kirk’s assassination. The White House has also requested an additional $58 million in security funding for the executive and judicial branches Kirk’s assassination, a Republican aide said.
Rubio in Mideast: Rubio met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem this morning. Israeli sources told CNN before the meeting that the Netanyahu was expected to raise his government’s potential West Bank annexation plans. Rubio’s visit comes after Israel’s strike in Doha last week. The secretary of state will also travel to Qatar, a senior State Department official said.
Nuclear power deal with UK: The US and UK governments will sign an agreement this week ushering in new deals on nuclear power between companies in the two countries. The news comes ahead of Trump’s state visit. You can read more details here about what to expect.
TikTok deal: A deal has been reached between the Trump administration and China to keep TikTok operational in the United States, US administration officials said, concluding a yearslong effort that began during President Donald Trump’s first term. The US president said he would be speaking to his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, on Friday.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said there has been no progress toward setting up a trilateral summit with Ukraine and the United States.
US President Donald Trump had raised that prospect after his Alaska summit last month with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin. The Kremlin has since insisted on several conditions for such a meeting.
But asked about the possibility on a media call today, Peskov said: “There is no progress so far,” adding there was a “pause” in the negotiation process on the conflict in Ukraine.
Asked about Trump’s remarks on Friday that his patience with Putin was wearing thin, Peskov said that the Kremlin had “heard these statements,” and Russia remained ready to resolve the crisis by political and diplomatic means.

Trump hints that a TikTok deal may have been reached with China

President Donald Trump suggested that a deal has been reached with China to keep TikTok operational in the United States, the conclusion of a yearslong effort that began during Trump’s first term.
“The big Trade Meeting in Europe between The United States of America, and China, has gone VERY WELL! It will be concluding shortly,” Trump posted on Truth Social. “A deal was also reached on a ‘certain’ company that young people in our Country very much wanted to save. They will be very happy! I will be speaking to President Xi on Friday.”
More on TikTok talks: Chinese and US diplomats have been meeting this week in Spain, to discuss trade and other matters. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, leading the latest round of trade talks on behalf of the United States, had said that TikTok was one of the subjects likely to be discussed.
Trump multiple times has extended a self-imposed deadline to reach a deal with China to sell at least part of its US TikTok business to an American-backed owner. A bipartisan bill passed by Congress and signed by former President Joe Biden banned TikTok in the United States unless its China-based owner divested its stake in the US assets of the social media company.
The deadline had most recently been extended to Wednesday.

Kirk’s killing was an attempt to intimidate others who want to engage with opposing viewpoints, Rubio says

The killing of Charlie Kirk is an attempt to silence those who want to openly engage in debate with those with opposing views, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said today while in Israel.
Rubio said that it was a “particularly difficult week” for the White House because Kirk was not only a supporter of President Donald Trump but also a “personal friend” to a lot of people at the White House.
Rubio went on to talk about Kirk’s efforts to engage with people he disagreed with.
“Apart from the tragedy of it for him and for his family and for the nation really is the irony: Charlie was one of the few people out there who was actually engaging in what we need more of. And that is debate and conversation among people with strong disagreements,” Rubio said.He added, “He would go on college campuses, and he would actively seek out and invite people who strongly disagreed with him to come to the microphone and engage in a back and forth. The alternative to the back and forth is just to attack each other. It’s very easy to do just do podcasts and just do interviews and give speeches where you attack the other side. It’s much harder to engage with people whose views are diametrically opposed to yours and engage them in a debate. And he did that.”
The secretary of state said that he believes the assassination was not only an effort to silence Kirk but also to intimidate others who wanted to engage in open dialogue with those with opposing viewpoints.

US and UK agree nuclear power deals ahead of Trump’s state visit
From CNN’s Olesya Dmitracova
The US and UK governments will sign an agreement this week ushering in new deals on nuclear power between companies in the two countries.
Among other things, the accord will make it easier to build new nuclear power stations in both countries – for example, by reducing the time it takes for a nuclear project to get a license from roughly three or four years to about two, the UK government said in a statement today.
“With President Trump’s leadership, the United States is ushering in a true nuclear renaissance – harnessing the power of commercial nuclear to meet rising energy demand and fuel the AI revolution,” US energy secretary Chris Wright said in the statement.
The agreement between DC and London, announced ahead of President Donald Trump’s state visit to the UK this week, clears the way for “a major expansion” of new nuclear projects in the country, according to the British government.
It is also in line with moves by the US administration earlier this year to boost nuclear energy, which include measures to speed up reactor testing and expand the enrichment of uranium.
Nuclear power, generally, doesn’t emit planet-warming pollution when generated or used. However, one problem is storing radioactive waste, which can remain dangerous for thousands of years.

'We don't see each other as humans anymore, we see each other as ideologies': CNN panel on a divided America
08:47
Charlie Kirk’s assassination has not yet crystallized into hard policy responses by the Trump administration, leaving the country in limbo, on the brink of something potentially significant that is yet to be defined.
The graphic nature of Kirk’s killing, which could be witnessed by anyone with a cellphone, and the conservative activist’s youth, political power and proximity to President Donald Trump may enshrine it as a searing collective moment in modern US history.
Its potential to galvanize profound reactions is more potent because it took place in a nation racked by its most venomous divides in decades, where every political win or loss can seem existential, and under an administration that often shows a desire to wield almost unlimited power.
This is also an age when activists and partisan media figures on the left and the right have personal and financial incentives to stoke division and social media tools to magnify their extremism.
This is a significant impediment for those political leaders who genuinely want to cool tempers. And no wonder lawmakers and opinion formers are reconsidering their exposure to the public following Kirk’s killing in a hunkering-down that could further constrain American democracy.
Trump has not chosen the traditional presidential route of invoking calm at perilous political moments. He’s ominously blaming his opponents collectively for a spate of worsening political violence that has spilled blood on both sides. “The problem is on the left. It’s not on the right,” he said Sunday.
One fear is that the assassination of Kirk, who took Trump’s MAGA movement to a younger generation of voters, will provoke more violence or reprisals against other political leaders, or will stifle open public debate.

White House requests $58 million in security funding from Congress following Kirk assassination
From CNN's Arlette Saenz
The White House has requested an additional $58 million in security funding for the executive and judicial branches following the assassination of Charlie Kirk, a Republican aide said.
The funding request is being “actively processed” in the context of the stopgap funding bill, the aide said.
The request comes amid heightened concerns about security, including among members of Congress, in the wake of the Kirk assassination. On Sunday, House Speaker Mike Johnson said leadership is looking at “all options” to bolster member security.

Rubio to visit Qatar after Israel trip, US official says
From CNN's Jennifer Hansler
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio will travel to Qatar as part of his current travels, a senior State Department official confirmed Monday.
The tiny Gulf state is a key US ally that welcomed President Donald Trump just four months ago; red carpets were laid, billion-dollar deals were done and a controversial presidential aircraft bequeathed.
Qatar is also a key mediator working to end the war in Gaza.
But last week another key US ally, Israel, struck Hamas in Doha without warning, upending peace talks and straining diplomatic ties.
Arab and Muslim leaders are meeting in Qatar today to discuss a response to the strike.
CNN’s Mostafa Salem contributed to this post, which was updated with the State Department confirming details of Rubio’s trip.

Rubio and Netanyahu met again today

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio is in Israel, where he met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this morning.
Three Israeli sources told CNN before the meeting that the Israeli leader was expected to raise his government’s potential West Bank annexation plans with Rubio. Talks were also expected to address the Israeli strike on Hamas in Doha and Israel’s intentions to expand its war in Gaza.
Some context: Israel has established Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank in defiance of international law. Palestinians want the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza for a future state, a position supported by most of the international community.
Yesterday, Rubio visited the Western Wall in the Old City of Jerusalem with Netanyahu and US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee.

Watch: Rubio visits Jerusalem's Western Wall
00:30
And this evening, Rubio is scheduled to attend the opening of the Pilgrimage Road at the City of David, a controversial archeological dig in the Palestinian neighborhood of Silwan in East Jerusalem.
The dig was first inaugurated by the former US Ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, who said it vindicated President Donald Trump’s decision in December 2017 to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.
That same year, Trump became the first sitting US president to visit the Western Wall, breaking decades of US precedent which held that the status of Jerusalem was to be determined in negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians.
Rubio’s trip comes after Israel’s strike in Doha stalled war talks just days after Hamas said it was reviewing a US-backed ceasefire proposal.
Before the trip, Rubio said he hoped to gain more clarity on Israel’s strategy and to “get a much better understanding of what their plans are moving forward.”

What to know about the TikTok deadline this week
From CNN's Kevin Liptak
President Donald Trump said he’s working toward an agreement with China on the future of TikTok, days ahead of a critical deadline for the social media app.
“We may let it die, or we may, I don’t know, it depends. It’s up to China,” Trump said yesterday.
“I’d like to do it for the kids,” he went on. “They like it.”
Trump faces a deadline on Wednesday to either enforce a law requiring TikTok’s parent company, Bytedance, to sell to a US buyer or be banned in the United States.
He’s already delayed enforcing the law three times.
The topic was a central point of discussion between Chinese and US officials — including US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer — in trade talks in Spain yesterday.
Those talks resumed today.
Trump, who seemed agnostic about a plan for the app, touted his success in using it to cultivate young voters in last year’s election.
“I did very well on TikTok, and I got the youth vote and I got numbers that nobody’s ever even come close to in the Republican Party,” he said.
“Some was attributed to TikTok, and a lot was attributed to Charlie,” he went on, referring to the late conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

Vice President JD Vance said that he will host the “Charlie Kirk Show” podcast at noon today.
“Please join me as I pay tribute to my friend,” he said on X yesterday.
Erika Kirk, the slain conservative activist’s widow, on Friday called the vice president a “dear friend” of Charlie Kirk and thanked him and the second lady Usha Vance “for their love and support.”
The vice president and second lady escorted the widow and her husband’s casket to Phoenix last week on a flight aboard Air Force Two from Salt Lake City.
