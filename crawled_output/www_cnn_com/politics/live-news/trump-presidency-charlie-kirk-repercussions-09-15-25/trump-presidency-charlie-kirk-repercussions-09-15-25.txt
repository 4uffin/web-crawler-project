What we're covering
• New details: Tyler Robinson, the suspect in Charlie Kirk’s murder, apparently confessed to the killing in a small chat group on the online platform Discord, the Washington Post reported today.
• Assassination roils DC: Vice President JD Vance hosted the “Charlie Kirk Show” podcast today as last week’s political assassination continues to roil the country.
• Suspect’s note: FBI Director Kash Patel provided new details about an alleged note written by the suspect. His interview with Fox was highly unusual, as FBI officials and Justice Department prosecutors generally avoid giving investigative details in a case that will be prosecuted.

Meanwhile: Thune accuses Schumer of angling for a government shutdown

Senate Majority Leader John Thune speaks to reporters at the US Capitol on Monday.
Ken Cedeno/Reuters
Senate Majority Leader John Thune accused his Democratic counterpart of angling for a government shutdown at the end of the month to appease “a portion of their base” that he said wants “to pick a fight with the Trump administration.”
“The Democrat leader is ready to hold the CR hostage and shut down the government over extraneous policy measures,” Thune said.
He reiterated that Republicans are proposing a stopgap bill to keep the government funded into November and would want to pass the package “as soon as this week.”
“We will be putting forward a clean resolution to ensure there is no reason for Democrats to oppose this bill and delay passage. My hope would be that we could get this done as soon as this week and then continue bipartisan work on appropriations bills,” he said.
The Republican leader said he “can’t imagine what Democrats think they’re going to gain from this.”

Washington Post: Charlie Kirk shooting suspect appears to confess in online chat

Tyler Robinson, the suspect in Charlie Kirk’s murder, apparently confessed to killing the right-wing activist in a small chat group on the online platform Discord, the Washington Post reported today.
A series of messages sent by Robinson to a small group of people show him saying he had “bad news,” and that it was “me at UVU yesterday,” the Post said, citing sources and screenshots the Post viewed.
He told the group that he would be surrendering shortly and thanked them for “all the good times and laughs,” the outlet said, adding it didn’t appear anyone responded to the chat.
CNN has reached out to law enforcement about Discord chats in the case, as well as the Utah Department of Public Safety for comment.
Robinson sent the messages about two hours before he was taken into custody, the Post said.

Vance blames a "growing and powerful minority on the far left" for Charlie Kirk's death

Vice President JD Vance blamed Charlie Kirk’s death on “a growing and powerful minority on the far left,” in his concluding remarks while hosting “The Charlie Kirk Show” today.
“We can thank God that most Democrats don’t share these attitudes, and I do, while acknowledging that something has gone very wrong with a lunatic fringe, a minority, but a growing and powerful minority on the far left,” Vance said on the show.
Vance added that there could be “no unity” with the people who “celebrate Charlie Kirk’s assassination” or “people who scream at children over their parents’ politics.” He was referencing a time he went to Disneyland with his kids, when he said multiple people yelled offensive things at his family.
“There was a loud and very vocal minority that would shout at my children, who were eight, five and three, whenever they got the opportunity. ‘You should disown your dad, you little sh*t,’ one middle-aged woman yelled at my five year old,” Vance said. “‘Tell the Secret Service to protect the Constitution, not your father,’ screamed another.”
“Are these women violent? Probably not. Are they deranged? Certainly,” Vance concluded, claiming it was a “statistical fact” that “most of the lunatics in American politics today are proud members of the far left.”
Vance’s comments echo recent remarks by President Donald Trump and others within the administration. Speaking to NBC News on Saturday, Trump said he wants the nation to “heal,” but added, “We’re dealing with a radical left group of lunatics, and they don’t play fair and they never did.”

Utah Democrats have received threats after Charlie Kirk's assassination, state lawmaker says

Utah state Rep. Angela Romero speaks with CNN on Monday.
CNN
Utah Democrats have received threatening calls and messages since Charlie Kirk was killed last week, Democratic state Rep. Angela Romero told CNN’s Pamela Brown and Wolf Blitzer, calling it “a real eye-opener” to be blamed for Kirk’s death.
Romero, the Democratic leader in the state House, said that one person called “almost every Democrat,” calling them names and telling them to “leave the state,” with a tone that she described as “really frightening.”
Asked by Blitzer whether state lawmakers are considering any bills in response to the fatal shooting, Romero said that “those are conversations we’re going to have.” She and Utah Senate Minority Leader Luz Escamilla are also weighing an appropriation request related to safety and security funding, Romero said.

Utah official says he thinks "a lot more" information on Kirk shooting investigation will be released tomorrow
From CNN's Eric Levenson
Utah Department of Public Safety Commissioner Beau Mason speaks with CNN on Monday.
CNN
“A lot more information” is expected to be released tomorrow once the state files charges against the suspect accused of killing Charlie Kirk, the Utah Department of Public Safety Commissioner Beau Mason told CNN’s Boris Sanchez.
“I do believe a lot more information tomorrow after those charges are filed will be able to speak to more of the intricacies of this investigation,” Mason said.
Mason declined to offer any details on the case, saying he did not want to compromise the integrity of the case against the suspect, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson.
He said investigators believe Robinson “acted alone” as the shooter. They are looking into the timeframe before and after the shooting, examining the suspect’s online behavior and interviewing personal contacts to learn more about him, Mason said.
“What I can speak to is we are still conducting follow-up interviews and a lot of investigative leads to determine any relationship that may have played into this, whether that be political or personal,” he said.
He added that those who had contact with the suspect were “very cooperative” with investigators.
Mason’s decision not to offer further details on the evidence is a contrast to that of FBI Director Kash Patel, who provided intimate details on the case in an interview with Fox News this morning.

TikTok deal makes a Trump-Xi meeting this year more likely, US officials say
From CNN’s Kevin Liptak

A deal with China that would allow TikTok to remain operating in the United States is a crucial step toward arranging a meeting between President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping in the coming months, US officials said today after a framework plan was announced.
Without a TikTok deal in place, a meeting between the two leaders wouldn’t be possible, the officials said. But an agreement makes it more likely the two men sit down when Trump visits Asia at the end of October, according to those officials.
Here are the key things to know:
Such an encounter would be the first in-person meeting between the two men since Trump reentered office. Both Trump and Xi agreed in their last phone call to visit each other’s countries, but no details were announced.
Beijing is hoping Trump will make a state visit to China to meet with Xi. American officials are hoping to extract concessions on trade and other issues before they agree, according to the US officials.
US officials are also hoping for additional agreements on Chinese purchases of soybeans and more action by China in cracking down on precursor chemicals for fentanyl, the officials said.
An alternate venue would be on the sidelines of the APEC summit in South Korea that’s scheduled for the end of October.
Trump and Xi are expected to discuss an in-person meeting when they speak by phone on Friday.

White House will go after leftist "terror" networks who organize doxxing campaigns, Miller says
From CNN’s Samantha Waldenberg
White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller speaks to Vice President JD Vance, who is guest hosting an episode of "The Charlie Kirk Show," on Monday.
Rumble
White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller said today the White House will be going after leftist “terror” networks who organize doxxing campaigns after the killing of Charlie Kirk.
“The organized doxxing campaigns, the organized riots, the organized street violence, the organized campaigns of dehumanization, vilification, posting people’s addresses, combining that with messaging that’s designed to trigger and incite violence and the actual organized cells that carry out and facilitate the violence. It is a vast domestic terror movement,” Miller told Vice President JD Vance, who was guest hosting an episode of “The Charlie Kirk Show.”
Miller did not specify any specific groups. He vowed to “use every resource we have at the Department of Justice, Homeland Security, and throughout this government to identify, disrupt, dismantle, and destroy these networks and make America safe again for the American people.”
He added they would do it “in Charlie’s name.”
Vance had numerous guests on the show to talk about Kirk’s assassination last week. Erika Kirk, the slain conservative activist’s widow, on Friday called the vice president a “dear friend” of her husband and thanked him and second lady Usha Vance “for their love and support.”

US and China have reached "basic framework consensus" on TikTok, top Chinese trade negotiator says
From CNN’s Bo Gu and Fred He

Brook Joyner/CNN
Officials from US and China held “candid and in-depth exchanges” and have “reached a basic framework consensus” to keep TikTok operational in the United States, Li Chenggang, China’s top trade negotiator and vice commerce minister, said today.
The talks between the two countries took places over the last two days in Spain and is the culmination of a years-long effort to determine the future of TikTok in the United States.
The framework agreed upon includes “resolving TikTok-related issues through cooperation, reducing investment barriers, and promoting relevant economic and trade cooperation,” Li said at a news conference in Madrid, according to Chinese state media.
US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said President Donald Trump will speak with Chinese leader Xi Jinping Friday to finalize the deal.
Remember: TikTok briefly went dark on January 18, 2025, ahead of a US ban of the app. A bipartisan bill passed by Congress and signed by former President Joe Biden toward the end of his term banned TikTok in the United States because of national security concerns, allowing the app to continue operating in America only if its China-based owner divested its stake in the US assets of the social media company.

Lawyers for Jeffrey Epstein’s estate provided a second production of documents to the House Oversight Committee on Friday, according to a letter obtained by CNN.
The document production included two more pages from Epstein’s so-called birthday book – a collection of letters gifted to the late convicted sex offender for his 50th birthday – that were redacted in the first production earlier this month.
The latest batch of documents also included another address book belonging to Epstein, according to the letter.
Epstein’s estate will continue producing documents to the congressional panel on a rolling basis in response to its subpoena.

Charlie Kirk prioritized supporter access over tighter security, executive producer says
From CNN’s Lily Hautau
Andrew Kolvet speaks to CNN on Monday.
CNN
Charlie Kirk’s team had been in constant coordination with the FBI ensuring Kirk’s safety amid many threats, Andrew Kolvet, the executive producer of “The Charlie Kirk Show” told CNN’s Pamela Brown.
Kolvet said they discussed additional protective measures but ultimately held back because Kirk “loved interacting with” the community. He said Kirk wanted to be as close to his supporters as possible, shaking hands and tossing hats into the crowd.
As Kirk mobilized young conservatives on college campuses, he faced numerous personal threats in recent years.
And his stops on campus tours were often met with impassioned protests that sometimes spiraled into chaos and violence, leading some schools to adopt strict security measures around his appearances.
As authorities continue investigating Kirk’s fatal shooting at his campus visit in Utah on Wednesday — the first on another nationwide tour of colleges — they have not yet said whether he faced any specific, recent threats before the event.
CNN’s Curt Devine, Rob Kuznia and Dalia Faheid contributed to this report.

Rubio doubles down on pledge to deny and revoke visas from those the US deems as celebrating Kirk's killing
From CNN's Jennifer Hansler
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio doubled down on the administration’s pledge to deny and revoke visas from those who the US deems as celebrating the murder of Charlie Kirk.
“We should not be giving visas to people who are going to come to the United States and do things like celebrate the murder, the execution, the assassination of a political figure,” Rubio said in an interview with Fox News today.“And if they’re already here, we should be revoking their visa. Why would we want to bring people into our country they’re going to engage in negative and destructive behavior?” he continued.
The State Department has not responded to questions on whether any visas have actually been revoked or how many officials are working on this initiative. It is unclear under what legal authorities the State Department would revoke the visas. The agency has said free speech is a priority.
In a post last week, Deputy Secretary of State Chris Landau said he had directed consular officers, who are involved in adjudicating visas, “to undertake appropriate action” against people “praising, rationalizing, or making light of” Kirk’s death.

Suspect in Kirk killing wrote a note saying he had an opportunity to take out the right-wing activist, FBI director says

The suspect in last week’s killing of Charlie Kirk wrote that he had the “opportunity to take out” the conservative influencer, and “I’m going to take it,” FBI Director Kash Patel said today.
The message was written prior to Wednesday’s shooting, Patel told Fox News. It’s unclear which form the message took; Patel described it as both a “note” and a “text message exchange.” He said the writing had since been “destroyed” but was recovered by investigators.
Patel did not share the full text of the message.
Patel’s interview with Fox is highly unusual, as FBI officials and Justice Department prosecutors generally avoid giving investigative details in a case that will be prosecuted for fear that it could damage the case.
Patel also said that DNA recovered from a screwdriver and towel which were both found with the gun used in Kirk’s killing were matched for the suspect in the assassination, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson.
Robinson’s family, Patel said, told investigators that Robinson had “subscribed to left-wing ideology.” Patel did not provide specifics on what that ideology included.
Robinson’s family, Patel said, told investigators that Robinson had “subscribed to left-wing ideology.”
Patel defended his agency’s role in the shooting amid mounting questions over his handling of the case and his leadership of the FBI. Bureau employees previously told CNN they were frustrated with how Patel led the investigation.

Qatari and US
officials had “serious discussions” about the two countries’ bilateral security and defense partnership after Israel targeted Hamas officials in an airstrike in Doha last week, a diplomat with knowledge of the discussions told CNN.
The discussions also included Qatar’s potential purchase of more advanced US defense equipment, the diplomat said.
Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani visited the White House and had dinner with US President Donald Trump on Friday, three days after the Israeli strike.
Trump has said publicly that he was “very unhappy about every aspect” of the Israeli attack.
Arab and Muslim leaders are meeting in Qatar today to discuss a response to last week’s Israeli strike. The diplomat said that Gulf Arab nations are in advanced discussions to solidify their collective military defense.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio will visit the Qatari capital Doha tomorrow following a visit to Israel, the diplomat told CNN earlier.

If you’re just joining us, we’re covering political developments in Washington, DC and beyond.
Here’s what to watch so far this morning:
Charlie Kirk: Vice President JD Vance said that he will host the “Charlie Kirk Show” podcast at noon today. Meanwhile, FBI Director Kash Patel provided new details about a note written by the suspect in Kirk’s assassination. The White House has also requested an additional $58 million in security funding for the executive and judicial branches Kirk’s assassination, a Republican aide said.
Rubio in Mideast: Rubio met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem this morning. Israeli sources told CNN before the meeting that the Netanyahu was expected to raise his government’s potential West Bank annexation plans. Rubio’s visit comes after Israel’s strike in Doha last week. The secretary of state will also travel to Qatar, a senior State Department official said.
Nuclear power deal with UK: The US and UK governments will sign an agreement this week ushering in new deals on nuclear power between companies in the two countries. The news comes ahead of Trump’s state visit. You can read more details here about what to expect.
TikTok deal: A deal has been reached between the Trump administration and China to keep TikTok operational in the United States, US administration officials said, concluding a yearslong effort that began during President Donald Trump’s first term. The US president said he would be speaking to his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, on Friday.
Ukraine-Russia: Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said there has been no progress toward setting up a trilateral summit with Ukraine and the United States.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said there has been no progress toward setting up a trilateral summit with Ukraine and the United States.
US President Donald Trump had raised that prospect after his Alaska summit last month with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin. The Kremlin has since insisted on several conditions for such a meeting.
But asked about the possibility on a media call today, Peskov said: “There is no progress so far,” adding there was a “pause” in the negotiation process on the conflict in Ukraine.
Asked about Trump’s remarks on Friday that his patience with Putin was wearing thin, Peskov said that the Kremlin had “heard these statements,” and Russia remained ready to resolve the crisis by political and diplomatic means.

Trump hints that a TikTok deal may have been reached with China

President Donald Trump suggested that a deal has been reached with China to keep TikTok operational in the United States, the conclusion of a yearslong effort that began during Trump’s first term.
“The big Trade Meeting in Europe between The United States of America, and China, has gone VERY WELL! It will be concluding shortly,” Trump posted on Truth Social. “A deal was also reached on a ‘certain’ company that young people in our Country very much wanted to save. They will be very happy! I will be speaking to President Xi on Friday.”
More on TikTok talks: Chinese and US diplomats have been meeting this week in Spain, to discuss trade and other matters. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, leading the latest round of trade talks on behalf of the United States, had said that TikTok was one of the subjects likely to be discussed.
Trump multiple times has extended a self-imposed deadline to reach a deal with China to sell at least part of its US TikTok business to an American-backed owner. A bipartisan bill passed by Congress and signed by former President Joe Biden banned TikTok in the United States unless its China-based owner divested its stake in the US assets of the social media company.
The deadline had most recently been extended to Wednesday.

Kirk’s killing was an attempt to intimidate others who want to engage with opposing viewpoints, Rubio says

The killing of Charlie Kirk is an attempt to silence those who want to openly engage in debate with those with opposing views, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said today while in Israel.
Rubio said that it was a “particularly difficult week” for the White House because Kirk was not only a supporter of President Donald Trump but also a “personal friend” to a lot of people at the White House.
Rubio went on to talk about Kirk’s efforts to engage with people he disagreed with.
“Apart from the tragedy of it for him and for his family and for the nation really is the irony: Charlie was one of the few people out there who was actually engaging in what we need more of. And that is debate and conversation among people with strong disagreements,” Rubio said.He added, “He would go on college campuses, and he would actively seek out and invite people who strongly disagreed with him to come to the microphone and engage in a back and forth. The alternative to the back and forth is just to attack each other. It’s very easy to do just do podcasts and just do interviews and give speeches where you attack the other side. It’s much harder to engage with people whose views are diametrically opposed to yours and engage them in a debate. And he did that.”
The secretary of state said that he believes the assassination was not only an effort to silence Kirk but also to intimidate others who wanted to engage in open dialogue with those with opposing viewpoints.

US and UK agree nuclear power deals ahead of Trump’s state visit
From CNN’s Olesya Dmitracova
The US and UK governments will sign an agreement this week ushering in new deals on nuclear power between companies in the two countries.
Among other things, the accord will make it easier to build new nuclear power stations in both countries – for example, by reducing the time it takes for a nuclear project to get a license from roughly three or four years to about two, the UK government said in a statement today.
“With President Trump’s leadership, the United States is ushering in a true nuclear renaissance – harnessing the power of commercial nuclear to meet rising energy demand and fuel the AI revolution,” US energy secretary Chris Wright said in the statement.
The agreement between DC and London, announced ahead of President Donald Trump’s state visit to the UK this week, clears the way for “a major expansion” of new nuclear projects in the country, according to the British government.
It is also in line with moves by the US administration earlier this year to boost nuclear energy, which include measures to speed up reactor testing and expand the enrichment of uranium.
Nuclear power, generally, doesn’t emit planet-warming pollution when generated or used. However, one problem is storing radioactive waste, which can remain dangerous for thousands of years.

'We don't see each other as humans anymore, we see each other as ideologies': CNN panel on a divided America
08:47
Charlie Kirk’s assassination has not yet crystallized into hard policy responses by the Trump administration, leaving the country in limbo, on the brink of something potentially significant that is yet to be defined.
The graphic nature of Kirk’s killing, which could be witnessed by anyone with a cellphone, and the conservative activist’s youth, political power and proximity to President Donald Trump may enshrine it as a searing collective moment in modern US history.
Its potential to galvanize profound reactions is more potent because it took place in a nation racked by its most venomous divides in decades, where every political win or loss can seem existential, and under an administration that often shows a desire to wield almost unlimited power.
This is also an age when activists and partisan media figures on the left and the right have personal and financial incentives to stoke division and social media tools to magnify their extremism.
This is a significant impediment for those political leaders who genuinely want to cool tempers. And no wonder lawmakers and opinion formers are reconsidering their exposure to the public following Kirk’s killing in a hunkering-down that could further constrain American democracy.
Trump has not chosen the traditional presidential route of invoking calm at perilous political moments. He’s ominously blaming his opponents collectively for a spate of worsening political violence that has spilled blood on both sides. “The problem is on the left. It’s not on the right,” he said Sunday.
One fear is that the assassination of Kirk, who took Trump’s MAGA movement to a younger generation of voters, will provoke more violence or reprisals against other political leaders, or will stifle open public debate.
