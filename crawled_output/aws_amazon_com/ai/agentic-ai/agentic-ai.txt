What is agentic AI?
Agentic AI marks the evolution from reactive assistants to proactive, autonomous systems that can understand, decide, and act with minimal oversight. AI agents access tools, data, and the internet to navigate complex tasks, adapt to changing conditions, and collaborate with other agents to get work done. Unlike traditional AI that simply answers questions, agents can think, plan, remember, and learn from experience — driving efficiency and innovation across industries like finance, healthcare, retail, and customer service. As transformative as the personal computer or the internet, AI agents are set to redefine how we work and live.
