How we build for security
Designed to be the most secure cloud
Maintaining customer trust is the foundation of our business at AWS and we know you trust us to protect your most critical and sensitive assets: your systems and data. That’s why every aspect of AWS – from our culture, to our infrastructure, to our data practices, to our operations – is designed to provide the most secure cloud computing environment available today.
Since 2006, AWS has been built to satisfy the security and compliance requirements of the military, global banks, and other high-sensitivity organizations. This is backed by a deep commitment to protect your data, help you meet mandated regulatory objectives, and simplify your audit processes.
Our commitment
"Delivering secure and operationally excellent services for our customers is, and will forever remain, our top priority."
