Accessibility Conformance Reports (ACRs)
Accessibility Conformance Reports (ACRs)
Accessibility Conformance Reports (ACRs) for AWS products and services are available on AWS Artifact, a self-service portal for AWS compliance-related information. Through AWS Artifact, you can download ACRs on-demand to understand the accessibility of a specific AWS product or service. AWS ACRs utilize the ITI Voluntary Product Accessibility Templates (VPAT®) and reference various accessibility standards including: Section 508 (U.S.), EN 301 549 (EU), and Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).After signing into the AWS Management Console, you can access the ACRs by selecting view reports in AWS Artifact.
