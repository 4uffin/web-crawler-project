Once relegated to the browser as one of the 3 core technologies of the web, JavaScript can now be found almost anywhere you find code.
JavaScript developers move fast and push software development forward; they can be as opinionated as the frameworks they use, so let's keep it clean here and make it a place to learn from each other!
