about #python
Python is an interpreted programming language that is considered "batteries-included". It was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991, and is popular for application and web development, as well as for scientific computing and data analysis.
Python 3 is the current language version. Python 2 is set to be deprecated in 2020.
