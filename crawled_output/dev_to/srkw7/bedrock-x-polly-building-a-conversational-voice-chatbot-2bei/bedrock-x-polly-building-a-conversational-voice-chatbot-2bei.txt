Bedrock Polly: Building a Conversational Voice Chatbot
#aws
#ai
#development
At Tokyo CommunityBuilders Night #2 / Jr.Champions collaboration event, I presented how to implement a conversational voice chatbot by combining Amazon Bedrock and Amazon Polly.
Event link: https://jawsug.connpass.com/event/363613/
This article summarizes the session and walks through the architecture, implementation code, and practical tips.
TL;DR
Use Bedrock to generate conversational scripts, then convert them into male/female alternating voices with Polly.
Control speech rate and pauses with SSML, creating a natural back-and-forth experience.
Cover Polly‚Äôs features, pricing, and production-ready tips, with code samples included.
The article first explains the background, then dives into the architecture ‚Üí implementation examples so you can quickly grasp the full picture.
Background
Why ‚ÄúConversational Voice Chatbot‚Äù?
We‚Äôve all been there:
You start reading a long article but get fatigued and click away.
You‚Äôd like to absorb information during your commute, but staring at a screen isn‚Äôt practical.
Post-COVID, with commuting and travel back in our routines, the demand for ‚Äúhands-free learning while doing something else‚Äù has grown significantly.
While many GenAI tools already offer text-to-speech features, a flat, mechanical voice gets boring fast. Listeners lose focus, or even fall asleep.
That‚Äôs why we explored dialogue-style narration:
One speaker delivers details.
Another provides summaries, follow-ups, or questions.
This dynamic creates rhythm and makes it feel like a radio show‚Äîeasy to listen through to the end.
Personalization effect: conversational tone improves comprehension and memory
Voice numerosity effect: switching voices resets attention and increases persuasion
Amazon Polly Overview
Amazon Polly is a cloud-based Text-to-Speech (TTS) service that turns text into lifelike voice.
With Neural voices, it produces natural, newscaster-quality audio. Combined with SSML, you can fine-tune prosody, pace, and pauses to approximate real conversations.
Key Features
29 languages, 60+ voices (Japanese included)
Tokyo (ap-northeast-1) region supports Standard and Neural voices
Low-latency synthesis
Popular Japanese voices:

For a conversational chatbot, the most natural combo is Takumi (Male, Neural) + Kazuha (Female, Neural).
Cost in Tokyo Region
Pricing is per character synthesized.
Voice Type
Per 1M characters
Approx JPY
Standard
\$4.00
~¬•600
Neural
\$16.00
~¬•2,400
Example: conversational setup with 500 chars/session √ó 10/day √ó 30 days = 150k chars/month
Standard only ‚Üí ~¬•90/month
Neural only ‚Üí ~¬•360/month
Mixed (Standard+Neural) ‚Üí ~¬•225/month
üëâ Very cost-effective for production usage.
Production Tips
Use SSML <break> tags after punctuation for natural pacing
Slow down speech (rate="slow") for technical terms or jargon
Implement fallbacks: if Neural synthesis fails, fall back to Standard (e.g., Kazuha ‚Üí Mizuki)
Architecture
User ‚Üí CloudFront ‚Üí API Gateway + Lambda
Lambda ‚Üí Bedrock (generate dialogue script)
Lambda formats text into SSML, split by male/female roles
Lambda ‚Üí Polly (Takumi / Kazuha, Neural voices) ‚Üí audio output
API Gateway + Lambda ‚Üí CloudFront ‚Üí User
Protect S3 with OAC, serve only via CloudFront
Add custom header check between CloudFront ‚Üí API Gateway to block direct API hits
Implementation Example
Project structure:
bedrock-polly-chatbot/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bin/bedrock-polly-chatbot.ts
# CDK entry
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cdk-stack.ts
# Infra definition
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lambda/app.py
# Lambda handler
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lambda/requirements.txt
# Python deps
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html
# Single-file UI
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Full code: https://qiita.com/srkw7/items/5f197986bebee4c7cadd
CDK deploys CloudFront, API Gateway, Lambda, and S3 site hosting.
Lambda calls Bedrock + Polly with SSML preprocessing.
index.html is a minimal UI with example prompts + SSML snippets.
Usage Example
Simple UI loads at CloudFront endpoint.
Input: ‚ÄúTell me about Amazon Polly pricing in Tokyo‚Äù
Output: alternating male/female voices with play/download options.
üëâ Users can listen while commuting or multitasking.
Summary
Key Takeaways
Bedrock ‚Üí generates conversational script
Polly (Neural voices) ‚Üí turns script into natural back-and-forth speech
SSML ‚Üí controls pacing and clarity
Infra ‚Üí CloudFront + API Gateway + Lambda, secured with OAI/OAC and headers
Cost ‚Üí very affordable (~¬•360/month for Neural, ~¬•90/month for Standard)
Ops Checklist
BEDROCK_MODEL_ID & ORIGIN_TOKEN set as env vars
Same region for Bedrock & Polly
Secure S3 (OAI/OAC) + protect API with custom headers
Allow POST/OPTIONS in CORS
Monitor Polly (char-based), Bedrock (token-based), CloudFront bandwidth costs
Future Extensions
Integrate RAG (KNOWLEDGE_BASE_ID) for domain-specific dialogues
Cache audio in S3 to reduce cost/latency
Add dictionary-based SSML rules for domain terms
Move from OAI ‚Üí OAC, add WAF for bot protection
Why not give your chatbot some personality?
Add conversational voice with Bedrock √ó Polly, and make your UX more engaging.
