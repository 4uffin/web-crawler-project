I work in a service-based corporate role where we primarily use Python. As many know, Python can be quite slow, especially when dealing with large datasets. We often work with MDF files and signal data, which used to take around 10 minutes just to load.
Recognizing this bottleneck, I proposed offloading the loading and computation parts to Rust for better performance. Initially, management was skeptical and resistant to the idea. It took quite a bit of effort to convince them, and the process was definitely hectic.
But eventually, I got the green light‚Äîand the results were amazing. The entire desktop application now loads in just 10‚Äì15 seconds. Huge win!
