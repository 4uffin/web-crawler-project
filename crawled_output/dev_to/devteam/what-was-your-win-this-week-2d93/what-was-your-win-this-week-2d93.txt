üéâ My big win this week - I won the Real-Time AI Agents Challenge!
Built BrandGuard AI, a multi-agent brand monitoring system that automatically tracks brand mentions across social platforms, analyzes sentiment, and delivers insights through web dashboard and Slack bot.
Working with Bright Data and n8n was an incredible experience.
Thanks to DEV.to, n8n, and Bright Data for organizing such an amazing challenge!
Really excited about this win üöÄ
