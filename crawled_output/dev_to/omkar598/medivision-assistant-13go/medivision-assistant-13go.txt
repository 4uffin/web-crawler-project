This is a submission for the Google AI Studio Multimodal Challenge
What I Built
MediVision Assistant - An AI-powered healthcare companion that makes medical assistance accessible to everyone, especially those with visual impairments or accessibility needs. The app combines computer vision, voice recognition, and AI chat to provide comprehensive health monitoring and assistance.
Key Features:
üñºÔ∏è AI Skin Analysis - Upload photos for instant skin condition assessment
üé• Video Health Analysis - Upload videos for comprehensive health monitoring and assessment
üé® AI Health Infographics - Generate professional medical infographics using Imagen 4.0
üé§ Voice Symptom Logger - Record and transcribe health symptoms using speech-to-text
üíä Medication Scanner - OCR-powered medication identification and management
üí¨ AI Health Chat - Conversational AI for health questions and guidance
‚ôø Full Accessibility Support - Voice navigation, screen reader compatibility, high contrast mode
üì± Progressive Web App - Works offline, installable on any device
Demo
Live Application: https://medivision.omkard.site
GitHub Repository: https://github.com/omkardongre/medi-vision-assistant-ai
Screenshots
Homepage Dashboard: Clean, accessible dashboard with health summary and quick actions
Skin Analysis: AI-powered skin condition analysis with detailed insights
Voice Logger: Voice-to-text symptom recording with transcription
Health Chat: Conversational AI for health questions
AI Health Infographics: Professional medical infographics
Health Records
Accessibility Features: Comprehensive accessibility toolbar with voice navigation
How I Used Google AI Studio
I leveraged Google AI Studio extensively to power the multimodal capabilities:
1. Gemini 2.5 Flash for Video Health Analysis
Integrated Gemini's advanced video analysis capabilities for comprehensive health monitoring
Analyzes uploaded videos up to 25MB for movement patterns, posture, gait analysis, and health indicators
Provides detailed health assessments with confidence scores and medical recommendations
Supports multiple video formats (MP4, MOV, AVI, WebM) with automatic optimization
2. Gemini 2.5 Flash for Skin Analysis
Integrated Gemini's vision capabilities to analyze uploaded skin photos
Provides detailed assessments of skin conditions, moles, rashes, and other dermatological concerns
Returns structured health insights with confidence scores and recommendations
3. Gemini 2.5 Flash for Health Chat
Powers the conversational AI health assistant
Processes natural language health questions and provides evidence-based responses
Maintains conversation context for follow-up questions
4. Imagen 4.0 for Health Infographics
Integrated Google Imagen 4.0 for professional medical infographic generation
Creates medication schedules, health progress charts, and symptom tracking visuals
Generates accessible, high-contrast infographics with professional medical styling
Supports download and sharing of AI-generated health content
Uses latest Imagen 4.0-generate-001 model for cutting-edge image generation
5. Multimodal Integration
Combined text, image, video, voice, and AI-generated visual content for comprehensive health monitoring
Multimodal Features
üé• Video + Text Analysis
Video Health Monitoring: Users upload videos for comprehensive health analysis including movement patterns, posture, and gait
Exercise Form Analysis: AI evaluates exercise techniques and provides improvement recommendations
Symptom Documentation: Video recordings of symptoms for detailed medical assessment
Progress Tracking: Visual health progress monitoring over time with video comparisons
üñºÔ∏è Image + Text Analysis
Skin Photo Analysis: Users upload photos of skin conditions, and Gemini analyzes them for potential health concerns
Medication OCR: Scans medication labels and bottles to extract drug information, dosages, and instructions
Visual Health Monitoring: Tracks changes in skin conditions over time with AI-powered analysis
üé§ Voice + Text Processing
Voice Symptom Logger: Records audio descriptions of symptoms and converts them to structured text
Voice Navigation: Complete app navigation using voice commands ("go home", "skin analysis", "emergency")
Audio Feedback: Text-to-speech responses for accessibility
üí¨ Conversational AI
Contextual Health Chat: AI remembers previous conversations and provides personalized health guidance
Multimodal Queries: Users can ask questions about their uploaded images, voice recordings, or general health topics
Emergency Response: Voice-activated emergency protocols with immediate AI assistance
‚ôø Accessibility-First Design
Screen Reader Compatible: Full ARIA labels and semantic HTML
Voice Commands: Navigate the entire app using voice ("skin analysis", "medication scanner", "help")
High Contrast Mode: Enhanced visibility for users with visual impairments
Font Scaling: Adjustable text size up to 300%
Keyboard Navigation: Complete app functionality without mouse
üé® AI-Generated Visual Content
Health Infographics: Professional medical charts and schedules generated by Imagen 4.0
Medication Schedules: Visual medication timing and dosage charts
Progress Tracking: Health milestone and achievement visualizations
Symptom Charts: Color-coded symptom monitoring and tracking graphics
Download & Share: Export AI-generated infographics for medical consultations
üîÑ Data Integration
Health Records: All multimodal inputs (videos, images, voice, chat, infographics) are stored and organized
Export Capabilities: Users can export their health data and AI-generated infographics for medical consultations
Video Storage: Secure video analysis results with privacy protection
Visual Content: AI-generated infographics stored and accessible for future reference
Technical Implementation
Frontend: Next.js 15 with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
AI Integration: Google AI Studio with Gemini 2.5 Flash (video, image, text, audio) and Imagen 4.0 (infographics)
Voice Processing: Web Speech API for speech-to-text and text-to-speech
Image Processing: Canvas API for image optimization and preprocessing
Deployment: Google Cloud Run with automatic scaling
Database: Supabase for health records and user data
Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant with comprehensive testing
Impact & Accessibility
This project demonstrates how AI can make healthcare more accessible to everyone, particularly:
Visually impaired users who can navigate entirely by voice
Elderly users who may have difficulty with complex interfaces
Users with motor disabilities who rely on voice commands
Non-native speakers who can describe symptoms in their own words
The multimodal approach ensures that health monitoring is not limited by traditional input methods, making medical assistance truly inclusive.
