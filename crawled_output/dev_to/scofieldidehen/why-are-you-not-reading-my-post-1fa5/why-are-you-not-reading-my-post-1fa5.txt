Why Are You Not Reading My Post?
#tutorial

Anyone who writes a post, article, how-to guide, etc., does so for people to consume, and it's painful when you write and no one seems to notice, or your post gets seen by only 1 or 2 people.
If you have a blog, this is one part of the journey that blog owners hardly share; for me, it is a daily task, figuring out what to post and what readers will be interested in seeing.
The amount of research that goes into it, and sometimes you end up writing, only to have it receive zero interactions. I remember feeling that my network was bad or the algorithm was flawed, as I kept reloading, hoping to see even one like or comment after spending weeks developing the content.
I know how draining that can be because I am still in the trenches of getting more readers to interact with my content.
Many blog owners are churning out AI-generated content with little regard for authenticity. The focus is to push out more posts, populate their blogs, and then buy backlinks to boost traffic.
As I mused about how to crack this invisible code, I figured throwing it out here for anyone and everyone to share their opinion was a good way to start.
Why are you here?
What do you enjoy reading?
Give me one person, a platform you enjoy reading from?
Please share what drives you here, and let's keep this going.
Have a great weekend.

Everyone is working on something, and most time we work too hard only to realize that whatever we are building is already outdated or not right for the market. How do you define what is right to build and when to build? Read my thoughts.
