This is a submission for the Google AI Studio Multimodal Challenge
I built a Women‚Äôs Health AI Web App that focuses on improving early breast cancer detection, overall women‚Äôs health awareness, and doctor efficiency.
The app solves two main problems:
For Doctors ‚Äì It reduces workload by automatically triaging mammograms and other scans, generating annotated heatmaps, risk scores, BI-RADS classifications, and longitudinal comparisons. Doctors receive AI-prepared reports that they can manually review, saving significant time.
For Patients ‚Äì It empowers women with personalized education and health guidance. The app generates simplified visual reports, self-exam teaching modules, cycle tracking, pregnancy visuals, nutrition annotation, and skin lesion checks.
This creates a dual experience:
Doctors get a technical clinical assistant that improves efficiency.
Patients get a personalized health companion that simplifies complex medical data.
Uploading a mammogram and receiving an annotated heatmap with BI-RADS score.
Patient-friendly report with plain-language explanation.
Doctor dashboard with Smart Triage Queue and longitudinal tumor tracking.
Teaching module showing self-breast exam steps generated as annotated visuals.
(If Gemini 2.5 Flash Image trial access is no longer active, include a demo video showcasing the AI-generated annotations, risk scoring, and education modules.)
üõ†Ô∏è How I Used Google AI Studio
I leveraged Google AI Studio as the foundation for my app by integrating Gemini‚Äôs multimodal capabilities:
Text + Image Understanding ‚Üí Mammogram, ultrasound, and X-ray scans are uploaded, and Gemini interprets the medical content, returning clinical risk scores and explanations.
Image Annotation ‚Üí Gemini automatically highlights suspicious areas in scans (tumors, lesions, cysts, bone density loss).
Image Generation ‚Üí Used for patient education (e.g., breast self-exam visuals, pregnancy growth diagrams, healthy vs unhealthy mole comparisons).
Multimodal Context Handling ‚Üí The model takes into account both the image and patient history (age, symptoms, family risk factors) to generate personalized outputs.
This allowed me to build a system where Gemini is not just analyzing but also teaching, guiding, and supporting clinical workflows.
üåê Multimodal Features
Here are the key multimodal features and why they matter:
Scan Upload + Annotation (Image ‚Üí Text + Image)
Doctors and patients upload medical scans.
Gemini analyzes and returns annotated heatmaps, BI-RADS categories, and explanations.
Enhances accuracy, speed, and clarity for doctors.
Report Generation (Text ‚Üí Dual Reports)
Clinical report (technical, BI-RADS, risk factors).
Patient report (plain language, visuals).
Enhances communication between doctors and patients.
Teaching Modules (Image Generation)
AI creates step-by-step annotated visuals for breast self-exam, menstrual cycle, pregnancy stages, bone health, and skin checks.
Enhances health literacy and self-awareness among women.
Doctor Efficiency Tools (Multimodal Decision Support)
Smart triage: AI sorts critical scans first.
Longitudinal tracking: Gemini compares old and new scans.
Enhances doctor productivity and clinical outcomes.
Telemedicine Integration
Remote patients can upload scans.
AI pre-screens before sending to doctor.
Enhances accessibility for rural/low-resource areas.
In summary:
This app leverages Gemini multimodal capabilities to build a full-stack women‚Äôs health assistant that helps doctors detect breast cancer faster and educates women on their health journey through visual, annotated, and personalized experiences.
