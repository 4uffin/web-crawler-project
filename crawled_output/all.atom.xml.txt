<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Prepatch</dt>
<dd>Prepatch or &quot;RC&quot; kernels are mainline kernel pre-releases that are
mostly aimed at other kernel developers and Linux enthusiasts. They
must be compiled from source and usually contain new features that
must be tested before they can be put into a stable release.
Prepatch kernels are maintained and released by Linus Torvalds.</dd>
<dt>Mainline</dt>
<dd>Mainline tree is maintained by Linus Torvalds. It's the tree where
all new features are introduced and where all the exciting new
development happens. New mainline kernels are released every 9-10
weeks.</dd>
<dt>Stable</dt>
<dd>After each mainline kernel is released, it is considered &quot;stable.&quot;
Any bug fixes for a stable kernel are backported from the mainline
tree and applied by a designated stable kernel maintainer. There are
usually only a few bugfix kernel releases until next mainline kernel
becomes available -- unless it is designated a &quot;longterm maintenance
kernel.&quot; Stable kernel updates are released on as-needed basis,
usually once a week.</dd>
<dt>Longterm</dt>
<dd>There are usually several &quot;longterm maintenance&quot; kernel releases
provided for the purposes of backporting bugfixes for older kernel
trees. Only important bugfixes are applied to such kernels and they
don't usually see very frequent releases, especially for older
trees.</dd>

<h2>Distribution kernels</h2>
<p>Many Linux distributions provide their own &quot;longterm maintenance&quot;
kernels that may or may not be based on those maintained by kernel
developers. These kernel releases are not hosted at kernel.org and
kernel developers can provide no support for them.</p>
<p>It is easy to tell if you are running a distribution kernel. Unless you
downloaded, compiled and installed your own version of kernel from
kernel.org, you are running a distribution kernel. To find out the
version of your kernel, run <cite>uname -r</cite>:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
# uname -r
5.6.19-300.fc32.x86_64
</pre>
<p>If you see anything at all after the dash, you are running a distribution
kernel. Please use the support channels offered by your distribution
vendor to obtain kernel support.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="releases-faq">
<h2>Releases FAQ</h2>
<p>Here are some questions we routinely receive about kernel release
versions. See also the main &quot;FAQ&quot; section for some other topics.</p>
<div class="section" id="when-is-the-next-mainline-kernel-version-going-to-be-released">
<h3>When is the next mainline kernel version going to be released?</h3>
<p>Linux kernel follows a simple release cadence:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>after each mainline release, there is a 2-week &quot;merge window&quot; period
during which new major features are introduced into the kernel</li>
<li>after the merge window closes, there is a 7-week bugfix and
stabilization period with weekly &quot;release candidate&quot; snapshots</li>
<li>rc7 is usually the last release candidate, though occasionally there
may be additional rc8+ releases if that is deemed necessary</li>
</ul>
<p>So, to find the approximate date of the next mainline kernel release,
take the date of the previous mainline release and add 9-10 weeks.</p>
<p>You can also subscribe to the releases calendar that forecasts key
development dates for the upcoming kernels:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://www.kernel.org/releases-calendar.ics">https://www.kernel.org/releases-calendar.ics</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-is-the-next-longterm-release-going-to-be">
<h3>What is the next longterm release going to be?</h3>
<p>Longterm kernels are picked based on various factors -- major new
features, popular commercial distribution needs, device manufacturer
demand, maintainer workload and availability, etc. You can roughly
estimate when the new longterm version will become available based on
how much time has elapsed since the last longterm version was chosen.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="why-are-some-longterm-versions-supported-longer-than-others">
<h3>Why are some longterm versions supported longer than others?</h3>
<p>The &quot;projected EOL&quot; dates are not set in stone. Each new longterm kernel
usually starts with only a 2-year projected EOL that can be extended
further if there is enough interest from the industry at large to help
support it for a longer period of time.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="does-the-major-version-number-4-x-vs-5-x-mean-anything">
<h3>Does the major version number (4.x vs 5.x) mean anything?</h3>
<p>No. The major version number is incremented when the number after the
dot starts looking &quot;too big.&quot; There is literally no other reason.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="does-the-odd-even-number-still-mean-anything">
<h3>Does the odd-even number still mean anything?</h3>
<p>A long time ago Linux used a system where odd numbers after the first
dot indicated pre-release, development kernels (e.g. 2.1, 2.3, 2.5).
This scheme was abandoned after the release of kernel 2.6 and these days
pre-release kernels are indicated with &quot;-rc&quot;.</p>

<h2>What is Linux?</h2>
<p>Linux is a clone of the operating system Unix, written from scratch by
Linus Torvalds with assistance from a loosely-knit team of hackers
across the Net. It aims towards POSIX and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.unix.org/">Single UNIX Specification</a>
compliance.</p>
<p>It has all the features you would expect in a modern fully-fledged Unix,
including true multitasking, virtual memory, shared libraries, demand
loading, shared copy-on-write executables, proper memory management, and
multistack networking including IPv4 and IPv6.</p>
<p>Although originally developed first for 32-bit x86-based PCs (386 or
higher), today Linux also runs on a multitude of other processor
architectures, in both 32- and 64-bit variants.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="new-to-linux">
<h2>New to Linux?</h2>
<p>If you're new to Linux, you don't want to download the kernel, which is
just a component in a working Linux system. Instead, you want what is
called a distribution of Linux, which is a complete Linux system. There
are numerous distributions available for download on the Internet as
well as for purchase from various vendors; some are general-purpose, and
some are optimized for specific uses. We currently have mirrors of
several distributions available at <a class="reference external" href="https://mirrors.kernel.org/">https://mirrors.kernel.org/</a>.</p>
<p>Note, however, that most distributions are very large (several
gigabytes), so unless you have a fast Internet link you may want to save
yourself some hassle and purchase a CD-ROM with a distribution; such
CD-ROMs are available from a number of vendors.</p>

<div class="section" id="i-heard-that-linux-ships-with-non-free-blobs">
<h2>I heard that Linux ships with non-free &quot;blobs&quot;</h2>
<p>Before many devices are able to communicate with the OS, they must first
be initialized with the &quot;firmware&quot; provided by the device manufacturer.
This firmware is not part of Linux and isn't &quot;executed&quot; by the kernel --
it is merely uploaded to the device during the driver initialization
stage.</p>
<p>While some firmware images are built from free software, a large subset
of it is only available for redistribution in binary-only form. To
avoid any licensing confusion, firmware blobs were moved from the main
Linux tree into a separate repository called <a class="reference external" href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/firmware/linux-firmware.git/">linux-firmware</a>.</p>
<p>It is possible to use Linux without any non-free firmware binaries, but
usually at the cost of rendering a lot of hardware inoperable.
Furthermore, many devices that do not require a firmware blob during
driver initialization simply already come with non-free firmware
preinstalled on them. If your goal is to run a 100% free-as-in-freedom
setup, you will often need to go a lot further than just avoiding
loadable binary-only firmware blobs.</p>

<div class="section" id="what-does-stable-eol-and-longterm-mean">
<h2>What does &quot;stable/EOL&quot; and &quot;longterm&quot; mean?</h2>
<p>As kernels move from the &quot;mainline&quot; into the &quot;stable&quot; category, two
things can happen:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>They can reach &quot;End of Life&quot; after a few bugfix revisions, which
means that kernel maintainers will release no more bugfixes for this
kernel version, or</li>
<li>They can be put into &quot;longterm&quot; maintenance, which means that
maintainers will provide bugfixes for this kernel revision for a
much longer period of time.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the kernel version you are using is marked &quot;EOL,&quot; you should consider
upgrading to the next major version as there will be no more bugfixes
provided for the kernel version you are using.</p>
<p>Please check the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.kernel.org/releases.html">Releases</a> page for more info.</p>

<p>Long-term support (&quot;LTS&quot;) kernels announced on the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.kernel.org/releases.html">Releases</a> page will
be marked as &quot;stable&quot; on the front page if there are no other current
stable kernel releases. This is done to avoid breaking automated parsers

kernel release marked as &quot;stable.&quot;</p>

<div class="section" id="linus-has-tagged-a-new-release-but-it-s-not-listed-on-the-front-page">
<h2>Linus has tagged a new release, but it's not listed on the front page!</h2>
<p>Linus Torvalds PGP-signs git repository tags for all new mainline kernel
releases, however a separate set of PGP signatures needs to be generated
by the stable release team in order to create downloadable tarballs. Due
to timezone differences between Linus and the members of the stable
team, there is usually a delay of several hours between when the new
mainline release is tagged and when PGP-signed tarballs become
available. The front page is updated once that process is completed.</p>

<div class="section" id="why-another-mailing-list-service">
<h2>Why another mailing list service?</h2>
<p>Linux development started in 1991 and has been ongoing for the past 30
years at an ever-increasing pace. Many popular code collaboration
platforms have risen throughout these three decades -- and while some of
them are still around, many others have shut down and disappeared
without offering any way to preserve the history of the projects they
used to host.</p>
<p>Development via mailed-in patches remains the only widely used mechanism
for code collaboration that does not rely on centralized infrastructure
maintained by any single entity. The Linux developer community sees
transparency, independence and decentralization as core guiding
principles behind Linux development, so it has deliberately chosen to
continue using email for all its past and ongoing collaboration efforts.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-about-vger-kernel-org">
<h2>What about vger.kernel.org?</h2>
<p>The infrastructure behind lists.linux.dev supports multiple domains, so
all mailing lists hosted on vger.kernel.org will be carefully migrated
to the same platform while preserving current addresses, subscribers,
and list ids. The only thing that will noticeably change is the
procedure to subscribe and unsubscribe from individual lists. As
majordomo is no longer maintained, we will instead switch to using

<p>To start using the Beijing mirror, simply clone from that location or
add a separate remote to your existing checkouts, e.g.:</p>

the patches you send to the LKML are applied to linux-next or to the
mainline git trees. If you are interested in trying it out, here are the
details:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The patches must be sent to the LKML (<a class="reference external" href="mailto:linux-kernel&#64;vger.kernel.org">linux-kernel&#64;vger.kernel.org</a>).</li>
<li>One of the cc's must be <a class="reference external" href="mailto:notify&#64;kernel.org">notify&#64;kernel.org</a> (Bcc will not work).</li>
<li>Alternatively, there should be a &quot;X-Patchwork-Bot: notify&quot; email header.</li>
<li>The patches must not have been modified by the maintainer(s).</li>
<li>All patches in the series must have been applied, not just some of them.</li>
</ul>
<p>The last two points are important, because if there are changes between
the content of the patch as it was first sent to the mailing list, and
how it looks like by the time it is applied to linux-next or mainline,
the bot will not be able to recognize it as the same patch. Similarly,
for series of multiple patches, the bot must be able to successfully
match all patches in the series in order for the notification to go out.</p>
<p>If you are using <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git-format-patch</span></tt>, it is best to add the special
header instead of using the Cc notification address, so as to avoid any
unnecessary email traffic:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
--add-header=&quot;X-Patchwork-Bot: notify&quot;
</pre>
<p>You should receive one notification email per each patch series, so if
you send a series of 20 patches, you will get a single email in the form
of a reply to the cover letter, or to the first patch in the series. The
notification will be sent directly to you, ignoring any other addresses
in the Cc field.</p>
<p>The bot uses our <a class="reference external" href="https://lore.kernel.org/patchwork">LKML patchwork instance</a> to perform matching and
tracking, and the <a class="reference external" href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mricon/korg-helpers.git/tree/git-patchwork-bot.py">source code</a> for the bot is also available if you
would like to suggest improvements.</p>

by using the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mricon/grokmirror">grokmirror</a> tool. The following repos.conf file should get
you all you need:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
[lore.kernel.org]
site = https://lore.kernel.org
manifest = https://lore.kernel.org/manifest.js.gz
toplevel = /path/to/your/local/folder
mymanifest = /path/to/your/local/folder/manifest.js.gz
pull_threads = 4
</pre>
<p>Please note, that you will require at least 20+ GB of local storage. The
mirroring process only replicates the git repositories themselves -- if
you want to use public-inbox with them, you will need to run
&quot;<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">public-inbox-init</span></tt>&quot; and &quot;<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">public-inbox-index</span></tt>&quot; to create the
database files required for public-inbox operation.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="linking-to-list-discussions-from-commits">
<h2>Linking to list discussions from commits</h2>
<p>If you need to reference a mailing list discussion inside code comments
or in a git commit message, please use the &quot;permalink&quot; URL provided by
public-inbox. It is available in the headers of each displayed message
or thread discussion. Alternatively, you can use a generic message-id
redirector in the form:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://lore.kernel.org/r/message&#64;id">https://lore.kernel.org/r/message&#64;id</a></li>
</ul>
<p>That should display the message regardless in which mailing list archive
it's stored.</p>

<h2>Mainline release tarball signatures</h2>
<p>Starting with the 4.18 final release, all mainline tarball PGP
signatures will be made by Greg Kroah-Hartman instead of Linus Torvalds.
The main goal behind this change is to simplify the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.kernel.org/signature.html">verification
process</a> and make all kernel tarball releases available for download on
kernel.org be signed by the same developer.</p>
<p>Linus Torvalds will continue to PGP-sign all tags in the mainline
git repository. They can be verified using the <tt class="docutils literal">git <span class="pre">verify-tag</span></tt>
command.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sunsetting-gz-tarball-generation">
<h2>Sunsetting .gz tarball generation</h2>
<p>We stopped creating .bz2 copies of tarball releases 5 years ago, and the
time has come to stop producing .gz duplicate copies of all our content
as well, as XZ tools and libraries are now available on all major
platforms. Starting September 1st, 2018, all tarball releases available
via <tt class="docutils literal">/pub</tt> download locations will only be available in XZ-compressed
format.</p>
<p>If you absolutely must have .gz compressed tarballs, you may obtain them
from git.kernel.org by following snapshot download links in the
appropriate repository view.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="no-future-pgp-signatures-on-patches-and-changelogs">
<h2>No future PGP signatures on patches and changelogs</h2>
<p>For legacy purposes, we will continue to provide pre-generated
changelogs and patches (both to the previous mainline and incremental
patches to previous stable). However, from now on they will be generated
by automated processes and will no longer carry detached PGP signatures.
If you require cryptographically verified patches, please generate them
directly from the <a class="reference external" href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git">stable git repository</a> after verifying the PGP
signatures on the tags using <tt class="docutils literal">git <span class="pre">verify-tag</span></tt>.</p>

full clones of kernel trees from git.kernel.org, we strongly recommend
that you use the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.kernel.org/cloning-linux-from-a-bundle.html">git bundles we provide</a> instead of performing a full
clone directly from git repositories.</p>
<p>It is better for you, because downloading the bundle from CDN is
probably going to be much faster for you than cloning from our frontends
due to the CDN being more local. You can even copy the bundle to a
fileserver on your local infrastructure and save a lot of repeated
external traffic.</p>
<p>It is better for us, because if you first clone from the bundle, you
only need to fetch a handful of newer objects directly from
git.kernel.org frontends. This not only uses an order of magnitude less
bandwidth, but also results in a much smaller memory footprint on our
systems -- git daemon needs a lot of RAM when serving full clones of
linux repositories.</p>
<p>Here is a simple script that will help you automate the process of first
downloading the git bundle and then fetching the newer objects:</p>

Nitrokey digital tokens for kernel developers2018-04-04T00:00:00+00:002024-08-06T19:40:29+00:00Konstantin Ryabitsevtag:www.kernel.org,2018-04-04:/nitrokey-digital-tokens-for-kernel-developers.html<p>The Linux Foundation IT team has been working to improve the code

integrity of git repositories hosted at kernel.org by promoting the use
of PGP-signed git tags and commits. Doing so allows anyone to easily
verify that git repositories have not been altered or tampered with no
matter from which worldwide mirror they may have been cloned. If the
digital signature on your cloned repository matches the PGP key
belonging to Linus Torvalds or any other maintainer, then you can be
assured that what you have on your computer is the exact replica of the
kernel code without any omissions or additions.</p>
<p>To help promote the use of PGP signatures in Linux kernel development,
we now offer a detailed guide within the kernel documentation tree:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/maintainer-pgp-guide.html">Kernel Maintainer PGP Guide</a></li>
</ul>
<img alt="Nitrokey logo" class="align-left" src="https://www.kernel.org/news/images/nitrokey-logo.png" style="width: 207px; height: 70px;" />
<p>Further, we are happy to announce a new special program sponsored by
<a class="reference external" href="https://linuxfoundation.org/">The Linux Foundation</a> in partnership with <a class="reference external" href="https://www.nitrokey.com/">Nitrokey</a> -- the developer
and manufacturer of smartcard-compatible digital tokens capable of
storing private keys and performing PGP operations on-chip. Under this
program, any developer who is listed as a maintainer in the <a class="reference external" href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/MAINTAINERS">MAINTAINERS</a>
file, or who has a kernel.org account can qualify for a free digital
token to help improve the security of their PGP keys. The cost of the
device, including any taxes, shipping and handling will be covered by
The Linux Foundation.</p>
<p>To participate in this program, please access the special store front
on the Nitrokey website:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://kernel.nitrokey.com/">Nitrokey Start for Kernel Developers</a></li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="who-qualifies-for-this-program">
<h2>Who qualifies for this program?</h2>
<p>To qualify for the program, you need to have an account at kernel.org or
have your email address listed in the <a class="reference external" href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/MAINTAINERS">MAINTAINERS</a> file (following the
&quot;<tt class="docutils literal">M:</tt>&quot; heading). If you do not currently qualify but think you should,
the easiest course of action is to get yourself added to the MAINTAINERS
file or to <a class="reference external" href="https://korg.wiki.kernel.org/userdoc/accounts">apply for an account at kernel.org</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="which-devices-are-available-under-this-program">
<h2>Which devices are available under this program?</h2>
<p>The program is limited to <a class="reference external" href="https://shop.nitrokey.com/shop/product/nitrokey-start-6">Nitrokey Start</a> devices. There are several
reasons why we picked this particular device among several available
options.</p>
<p>First of all, many Linux kernel developers have a strong preference not
just for open-source software, but for open hardware as well. Nitrokey
is one of the few companies selling GnuPG-compatible smartcard devices
that provide both, since Nitrokey Start is based on Gnuk cryptographic
token firmware developed by <a class="reference external" href="https://www.fsij.org/category/gnuk.html">Free Software Initiative of Japan</a>. It is
also one of the few commercially available devices that offer native
support for ECC keys, which are both faster computationally than large
RSA keys and generate smaller digital signatures. With our push to use
more code signing of git objects themselves, both the open nature of the
device and its support for fast modern cryptography were key points in
our evaluation.</p>
<p>Additionally, Nitrokey devices (both Start and Pro models) are already
<a class="reference external" href="https://lwn.net/Articles/736231/">used by open-source developers</a> for cryptographic purposes and they
are known to work well with Linux workstations.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-is-the-benefit-of-digital-smartcard-tokens">
<h2>What is the benefit of digital smartcard tokens?</h2>
<p>With usual GnuPG operations, the private keys are stored in the home
directory where they can be stolen by malware or exposed via other
means, such as poorly secured backups. Furthermore, each time a GnuPG
operation is performed, the keys are loaded into system memory and can
be stolen from there using sufficiently advanced techniques (the likes
of Meltdown and Spectre).</p>
<p>A digital smartcard token like Nitrokey Start contains a cryptographic
chip that is capable of storing private keys and performing crypto
operations directly on the token itself. Because the key contents never
leave the device, the operating system of the computer into which the
token is plugged in is not able to retrieve the private keys themselves,
therefore significantly limiting the ways in which the keys can be
leaked or stolen.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="questions-or-problems">
<h2>Questions or problems?</h2>
<p>If you qualify for the program, but encounter any difficulties
purchasing the device, please contact Nitrokey at <a class="reference external" href="mailto:shop&#64;nitrokey.com">shop&#64;nitrokey.com</a>.</p>

<div class="section" id="basic-concepts">
<h2>Basic concepts</h2>
<p>Every kernel release comes with a cryptographic signature from the
person making the release. This cryptographic signature allows anyone to
verify whether the files have been modified or otherwise tampered with
after the developer created and signed them. The signing and
verification process uses public-key cryptography and it is next to
impossible to forge a PGP signature without first gaining access to the
developer's private key. If this does happen, the developers will revoke
the compromised key and will re-sign all their previously signed
releases with the new key.</p>
<p>To learn more about the way PGP works, please consult <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy#How_PGP_encryption_works">Wikipedia</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="kernel-org-web-of-trust">
<h2>Kernel.org web of trust</h2>
<p>PGP keys used by members of kernel.org are cross-signed by other members
of the Linux kernel development community (and, frequently, by many
other people). If you wanted to verify the validity of any key belonging
to a member of kernel.org, you could review the list of signatures on
their public key and then make a decision whether you trust that key or
not. See the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust">Wikipedia article</a> on the subject of the Web of Trust.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="using-the-web-key-directory">
<h2>Using the Web Key Directory</h2>
<p>If the task of maintaining your own web of trust is too daunting to you,
you can opt to shortcut this process by using the &quot;Trust on First Use&quot;
(TOFU) approach and rely on the kernel.org Web Key Directory (WKD).</p>
<p>To import keys belonging to many kernel developers, you can use the
following command:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ gpg2 --locate-keys [username]&#64;kernel.org
</pre>
<p>For example, to import keys belonging to Linus Torvalds and Greg
Kroah-Hartman, you would use:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ gpg2 --locate-keys torvalds&#64;kernel.org gregkh&#64;kernel.org
</pre>
<p>This command will verify the TLS certificate presented by kernel.org
before importing these keys into your keyring.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="using-gnupg-to-verify-kernel-signatures">
<h2>Using GnuPG to verify kernel signatures</h2>
<p>All software released via kernel.org has detached PGP signatures you can
use to verify the integrity of your downloads.</p>
<p>To illustrate the verification process, let's use Linux 4.6.6 release as
a walk-through example. First, use &quot;<tt class="docutils literal">curl</tt>&quot; to download the release
and the corresponding signature:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ curl -OL https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v4.x/linux-4.6.6.tar.xz
$ curl -OL https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v4.x/linux-4.6.6.tar.sign
</pre>
<p>You will notice that the signature is made against the uncompressed
version of the archive. This is done so there is only one signature
required for .gz and .xz compressed versions of the release. Start
by uncompressing the archive, using <tt class="docutils literal">unxz</tt> in our case:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ unxz linux-4.6.6.tar.xz
</pre>
<p>Now verify the .tar archive against the signature:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ gpg2 --verify linux-4.6.6.tar.sign
</pre>
<p>You can combine these steps into a one-liner:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ xz -cd linux-4.6.6.tar.xz | gpg2 --verify linux-4.6.6.tar.sign -
</pre>
<p>It's possible that you get a &quot;No public key error&quot;:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
gpg: Signature made Wed 10 Aug 2016 06:55:15 AM EDT using RSA key ID 38DBBDC86092693E
gpg: Can't check signature: No public key
</pre>
<p>Please use the &quot;<tt class="docutils literal">gpg2 <span class="pre">--locate-keys</span></tt>&quot; command listed above to download
the key for Greg Kroah-Hartman and Linus Torvalds and then try again:</p>

<p>To make the &quot;<tt class="docutils literal">WARNING</tt>&quot; message go away you can indicate that you
choose to trust that key using TOFU:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">

this are multiple, but largely this is because people who are most
interested in pre-release tags -- kernel developers -- do not rely on
patches and tarballs to do their work.</p>
<div class="section" id="obtaining-tarballs-on-your-own">
<h2>Obtaining tarballs on your own</h2>
<p>Here is how you can generate the tarball from a pre-release tag using
the &quot;<tt class="docutils literal">git archive</tt>&quot; command (we'll use 4.12-rc1 in these examples):</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git
cd linux
git verify-tag v4.12-rc1
git archive --format=tar.gz --prefix=linux-4.12-rc1/ \
-o linux-4.12-rc1.tar.gz v4.12-rc1
</pre>
<p>The upside of this method is that during the &quot;<tt class="docutils literal">git <span class="pre">verify-tag</span></tt>&quot; step
you will check the PGP signature on the tag to make sure that what you
cloned is exactly the same tree as on Linus Torvalds's computer.</p>
<p>The downside of this method is that you will need to download about 1
GiB of data -- the entire git history of the Linux kernel -- just to get
the latest tag. Notably, when -rc2 is tagged, all you'll need to do is
run a quick &quot;<tt class="docutils literal">git pull</tt>&quot; to get the latest objects and it will be
dramatically less data to download, so cloning the whole tree may be
worth it to you in the long run if you plan to do this again in the
future.</p>
<p>If you do not want to download the whole git repository and just want to
get the latest tarball, you can download the version automatically
generated by cgit at the following (or similar URL):</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
wget https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/t/linux-4.12-rc1.tar.gz
</pre>
<p>Please note that you will not be able to cryptographically verify the
integrity of this archive, but the download will be about 10 times less
in size than the full git tree.</p>

<h2>Obtaining patches to the previous mainline</h2>
<p>If you would like to get just the patch to the previous mainline
release, you can get it from cgit as well:</p>

wget -O patch-4.12-rc1 https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/p/v4.12-rc1/v4.11

<p>Unfortunately, cgit does not currently offer an easy way to get

<h2>Why not provide these at their old locations?</h2>
<p>We intentionally did not provide these automatically generated tarballs
and patches in locations previously used by Linus
(<tt class="docutils literal">/pub/linux/kernel/v4.x/testing</tt>), even if this meant potentially
breaking automated scripts relying on contents published there. Anything
placed in the /pub tree is signed and curated directly by developers
and all patches and software archives published there invariably come
with a PGP signature provided directly by the developer of that software
(or one of the developers).</p>
<p>Patches and tarballs automatically generated by git.kernel.org are NOT
a replacement for this stringent process, but merely a convenience
service that comes with very different trust implications. By providing
these at different URLs we wanted all users of these services to make a
conscious decision on whether they want to trust these automatically
generated tarballs and patches, or whether they want to change their
process to continue to use PGP-verifiable tags directly from the git
tree.</p>

<p>We are extremely happy to announce that <a class="reference external" href="https://www.packet.net/">Packet</a> has graciously donated
the new hardware systems providing read-only public access to the
kernel.org git repositories and the public website (git.kernel.org and
www.kernel.org, respectively). We have avoided using cloud providers in
the past due to security implications of sharing hypervisor memory with
external parties, but Packet's hardware-based single-tenant approach
satisfies our security requirements while taking over the burden of
setting up and managing the physical hardware in multiple worldwide
datacenters.</p>
<p>As of March 11, 2017, the four new public frontends are located in the
following geographical locations:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>San Jose, California, USA</li>
<li>Parsippany, New Jersey, USA</li>
<li>Amsterdam, Netherlands</li>
<li>Tokyo, Japan</li>
</ul>
<p>We have changed our DNS configuration to support GeoDNS, so your
requests should be routed to the frontend nearest to you.</p>
<p>Each Packet-hosted system is <a class="reference external" href="https://www.packet.net/bare-metal/servers/type-2-virtualization/">significantly more powerful</a> than our
previous generation frontends and have triple the amount of available
RAM, so they should be a lot more responsive even when a lot of people
are cloning linux.git simultaneously.</p>
<p>Our special thanks to the following organizations who have graciously
donated hosting for the previous incarnation of kernel.org frontends:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://www.isc.org/">Internet Systems Consortium</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://www.vexxhost.com/">Vexxhost</a></li>

you used to be able to mount kernel.org directly as a partition on your
system using NFS (or even SMB/CIFS). The Wayback Machine shows that this
was still advertised some time in <a class="reference external" href="https://web.archive.org/web/19980130085039/http://www.kernel.org/">January 1998</a>, but was removed by
the time the <a class="reference external" href="https://web.archive.org/web/19981212030306/http://www.kernel.org/">December 1998</a> copy was made.</p>
<p>Let's face it -- while kinda neat and convenient, offering a public
NFS/CIFS server was a Pretty Bad Idea, not only because both these
protocols are pretty terrible over high latency connections, but also
because of important security implications.</p>
<p>Well, 19 years later we're thinking it's time to terminate another
service that has important protocol and security implications -- our
FTP servers. Our decision is driven by the following considerations:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The protocol is inefficient and requires adding awkward kludges to
firewalls and load-balancing daemons</li>
<li>FTP servers have no support for caching or accelerators, which has
significant performance impacts</li>
<li>Most software implementations have stagnated and see infrequent updates</li>
</ul>
<p>All kernel.org FTP services will be shut down by the end of this year.
In hopes to minimise the potential disruption, we will be doing it in
two stages:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="ftp://ftp.kernel.org/">ftp://ftp.kernel.org/</a> service will be terminated on March 1, 2017</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="ftp://mirrors.kernel.org/">ftp://mirrors.kernel.org/</a> service will be terminated on December 1, 2017</li>

perform a fresh clone of Linux.git, you may find it tricky to do so if
your connection resets before you are able to complete the clone. There
is currently no way to resume a git clone using git, but there is a neat
trick you can use instead of cloning directly -- using <a class="reference external" href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bundle">git bundle</a>
files.</p>
<p>Here is how you would do it.</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Start with &quot;<tt class="docutils literal">wget <span class="pre">-c</span></tt>&quot;, which tells wget to continue interrupted
downloads. If your connection resets, just rerun the same command while
in the same directory, and it will pick up where it left off:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
wget -c https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/clone.bundle
</pre>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Next, clone from the bundle:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
git clone clone.bundle linux
</pre>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Now, point the origin to the live git repository and get the latest changes:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
cd linux
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git
git pull origin master
</pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Once this is done, you can delete the &quot;<tt class="docutils literal">clone.bundle</tt>&quot; file, unless
you think you will need to perform a fresh clone again in the future.</p>
<p>The &quot;<tt class="docutils literal">clone.bundle</tt>&quot; files are generated weekly on Sunday, so they
should contain most objects you need, even during kernel merge windows
when there are lots of changes committed daily.</p>

to high IO load.</p>
<p>We have recently upgraded our hardware in order to increase capacity --
16TB was no longer nearly sufficient enough to host all the distro
mirrors and archives. We chose larger but slower disks and offset the
loss of performance by heavily utilizing SSD IO caching using dm-cache.</p>
<p>While it was performing very well, we have unfortunately run across an
FS data corruption bug somewhere along this stack:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
megaraid_sas + dm_cache + libvirt/virtio + xfs
</pre>
<p>We've temporarily removed dm-cache from the picture and switched to
Varnish on top of SSD for http object caching. Unfortunately, as Varnish
does not support FTP, we had to restrict FTP protocol to a limited
number of concurrent sessions in order to reduce disk IO. If you are
affected by this, simply switch to HTTP protocol that does not have such
restrictions.</p>
<p>This is a temporary measure until we identify the dm-cache problem that
was causing data corruption, at which point we will restore unrestricted
FTP access.</p>

<p>Install this configuration file anywhere that makes sense in your
environment. You'll need to make sure that the following directories (or
whatever you changed them to) are writable by the &quot;mirror&quot; user:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal">/var/lib/git/mirror</tt></li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">/var/log/mirror</tt></li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">/var/lock/mirror</tt></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<div class="section" id="mirroring-kernel-org-git-repositories">
<h2>Mirroring kernel.org git repositories</h2>
<p>Now all you need to do is to add a cronjob that will check the
kernel.org mirror for updates. The following entry in
<tt class="docutils literal">/etc/cron.d/grokmirror.cron</tt> will check the mirror every 5 minutes:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
# Run grok-pull every 5 minutes as &quot;mirror&quot; user
*/5 * * * * mirror /usr/bin/grok-pull -p -c /etc/grokmirror/repos.conf
</pre>
<p>(You will need to adjust the paths to the grok-pull command and to
repos.conf accordingly to reflect your environment.)</p>
<p>The initial run will take many hours to complete, as it will need to
download about 50 GB of data.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="mirroring-a-subset-of-repositories">
<h2>Mirroring a subset of repositories</h2>
<p>If you are only interested in carrying a subset of git repositories
instead of all of them, you are welcome to tweak the <tt class="docutils literal">include</tt> and
<tt class="docutils literal">exclude</tt> parameters.</p>

Pelican (which we largely adapted) has an unclear license. Until this is
cleared up, we've put together a quick-and-dirty cleanroom CSS
reimplementation that preserves the functional aspects of the site, but
sacrifices a lot of the bells and whistles.</p>

style, please let us know at <a class="reference external" href="mailto:webmaster&#64;kernel.org">webmaster&#64;kernel.org</a>.</p>
