Robinson was taken into custody on 12 September after his father persuaded him to surrender to police, a development investigators described as pivotal in ending a 33-hour nationwide manhunt. Investigators said the father recognised Robinson from the images released by law enforcement, and he confronted his son. The father then spoke to a youth pastor, who called the US Marshals. The suspect is now being held at Utah County Jail without bail, where he is on special watch to determine if he is a risk to himself or others, police told the BBC's US partner CBS News.An affidavit from the state of Utah confirms that Robinson was arrested on suspicion of the crimes of aggravated murder, felony discharge of a firearm, and obstruction of justice.Utah County Attorney Jeff Gray said he anticipates filing formal charges on Tuesday. Robinson is also expected to make his first court appearance on Tuesday.Robinson has no prior convictions and no history of violent offences, according to a Public Safety Assessment Report filed in Utah state court.FBIAt a press briefing on Friday announcing the arrest, FBI officials declined to discuss Robinson's background, political leanings, or possible motive, saying the investigation was ongoing. "We are confident we have the right individual in custody," an FBI spokesperson said, "but we are still working to establish the full picture of who he is and why he acted."Shooting throws Utah students into heart of US political divideSuspected killer brought into custody after confessing to fatherUtah Governor Spencer Cox said a family member interviewed by investigators stated that Robinson had become "more political" in recent years.The relative also said that during a dinner conversation before the attack, Robinson had discussed Kirk's upcoming event at Utah Valley University, according to Cox."They talked about why they didn't like him and the viewpoints that he had," Cox said referring to the conversation.Public records reviewed by the BBC suggest Robinson had in the past registered as an unaffiliated, or nonpartisan, voter in Utah. His parents, Matthew Carl Robinson and Amber Denise Robinson are registered Republicans, according to state records.People who lived in the Robinson's Washington, Utah neighbourhood told the BBC had a good reputation in the community.One neighbour, who asked the BBC not publish her name, called his parents "amazing" and hard workers. The family was Mormon, she said.Tyler Robinson was not enrolled at UVU, the site of the shooting. In a statement, the Utah Board of Higher Education said Tyler James Robinson was a third-year student in the electrical apprenticeship programme at Dixie Technical College. "He previously spent one semester at Utah State University in 2021 and earned concurrent enrolment credits through Utah Tech University while in high school between 2019 and 2021," it added.Social media accounts indicate Robinson's father runs a kitchen countertop and cabinet installation business, while his mother is a social worker. The family is Mormon and active in the local church. Utah governor details how Charlie Kirk murder suspect apprehendedInvestigators say Robinson was steeped in online culture, pointing to inscriptions on shell casings linked to the case.Two casings displayed apparent references to online trolling humour. The inscription "notices bulges OwO what's this?" on a fired shell casing may refer to a "copypasta" - a piece of text that is repeated over and over again, often to troll people online. Another casing, that was unfired, was inscribed with the words "If you read this, you are gay lmao" - again an apparent reference to a trolling joke.Meanwhile, other casings could be interpreted as sympathetic to Antifa, or the anti-fascist movement, a loose collection of far-left activists who have been active in the US over the last decade and often demonstrate against Trump policies and far-right groups.
One unfired casing had the words "Hey fascist! Catch!" and an up, right and three down arrows. The three down arrows alone could be a common symbol used for anti-fascism. But as a whole, the arrows could reference a sequence of control inputs used in a popular video game - although this remains unclear, and authorities have not yet released images of the casings.A second casing was inscribed with lyrics to the song "Bella Ciao" that honours World War Two-era partisans of the Italian resistance who fought Nazi Germany.Authorities said Robinson also appeared to have been active on Discord, the social media platform primarily used by gamers, but now also popular with other communities.According to an affidavit, a roommate of Robinson's showed investigators messages on Discord, a messaging and social app, from a contact named "Tyler" referencing a rifle "drop point" and instructions about retrieving and hiding the weapon.Discord later issued a statement saying his account had been suspended.
"We have removed the suspect's account for violating our off-platform behavior policy," it said.For now, Robinson remains in custody as prosecutors prepare formal charges. The investigation into his background, motives, and potential affiliations continues in what officials are calling one of the most significant political killings in recent US history.US gun violenceUnited StatesUtahRelated'We knew the family:' Utah town in disbelief after neighbour accused of killing Charlie Kirk'I will never let your legacy die' - Charlie Kirk's widow gives tearful address after shootingNew clues in hunt for Charlie Kirk's killerMore from the BBC3 hrs agoAfter fatal crash, Sikh truck drivers in the US fear blowbackSikh truck drivers say they've experienced an uptick in harassment after a fatal crash thrust them into the national spotlight.3 hrs ago5 hrs agoAnimal shelter workers hospitalised after FBI uses furnace to burn seized methFourteen staff were hospitalised and 75 cats and dogs evacuated.5 hrs ago6 hrs agoTrump 'ready' to sanction Russia if Nato nations stop buying its oilThe US president has repeatedly threatened tougher measures against Moscow, but has so far failed to take action.6 hrs ago8 hrs agoMemphis mayor 'not happy' about Trump's plan to send National GuardThe deployment of the National Guard to Memphis comes roughly a month after he sent troops to Washington DC. 8 hrs ago10 hrs agoCharlie Kirk: Conservative influencer who rallied a youth movementKirk, an influential Trump ally who at age 18 set up Turning Point USA, died in a shooting while speaking at a Utah campus event.10 hrs agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
