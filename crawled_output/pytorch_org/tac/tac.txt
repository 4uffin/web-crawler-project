Technical Advisory Council
The PyTorch Foundation’s Technical Advisory Council (TAC) provides a forum for technical communication, leadership, and collaboration for the PyTorch Foundation. The committee members are members of the PyTorch Foundation.
The TAC holds open meetings once a month that anyone in the community can attend. The committee provides thought leadership on technical topics, knowledge sharing, and a forum to discuss issues with other technical experts in the community.

Brian GrangerAmazon Web ServicesSenior Principal TechnologistBrian GrangerSenior Principal TechnologistBrian Granger is a Senior Principal Technologist at Amazon Web Services and a professor of physics and data science at Cal Poly State University in San Luis Obispo, CA. He works at the intersection of UX design and engineering on tools for scientific computing, data science, machine learning, and data visualization. Brian is a co-founder and leader of Project Jupyter, co-founder of the Altair project for statistical visualization, and creator of the PyZMQ project for ZMQ-based message passing in Python.
Gregory ChananMetaGregory ChananJeff DailyAMDFellowJeff DailyFellowJeff Daily is a Fellow at AMD and the chief architect of the Machine Learning Software Engineering group supporting ML frameworks such as PyTorch and onnxruntime on AMD GPUs. He enjoys delivering open source software to answer the challenges of the rapidly-changing ML landscape. For over five years, he has contributed to the PyTorch core as well as its extension libraries. His sustained contributions earned him the first ever Linux Foundation PyTorch Award “for excellence in long-term contributions across all PyTorch modalities.” Though he has not achieved the status of maintainer, Jeff is a trusted contributor. Jeff’s technical leadership is one of the reasons PyTorch runs out of the box without any code modifications on AMD GPUs. In addition to PyTorch technical contributions, Jeff is the AMD representative for the PyTorch Foundation’s Technical Advisory Committee.
Jeremy EderIBMJeremy EderJoe PamerGoogleJoe PamerLuca AntigaLightning AICTOTAC ChairLuca AntigaCTOLuca Antiga is the CTO at Lightning AI. He is an early contributor to PyTorch core and co-authored “Deep Learning with PyTorch” (published by Manning). He started his journey as a researcher in Bioengineering, and later co-founded Orobix, a company focused on building and deploying AI in production settings.
Milos PuzovicArmTechnical DirectorMilos PuzovicTechnical DirectorMilos Puzovic is Technical Director at Arm where he is working on accelerating machine learning frameworks such as PyTorch on AArch64. In the past, he worked on designing and developing infrastructure for rapid development and deployment to edge devices and cloud of novel neural models that were trained using semi-supervised approach. He also has interest in optimizing applications through hardware and software co-design by using machine learning, code generation, optimization and verification of high-level models for different types of architecture. Milos has PhD in Computer Science from University of Cambridge where his thesis was on hardware/software interface for dynamic multicore scheduling and BSc with First Class Honors in Joint Mathematics and Computer Science from Imperial College London.
Piotr BialeckiNVIDIAPiotr BialeckiPiotr joined PyTorch team at NVIDIA in 2019 and currently manages the team.

Wang WeihanIntelWang WeihanXavier DupréMicrosoftXavier DupréGraduated in 1999 from the ENSAE and doctor in 2004, Xavier Dupré began his career at A2iA, a company specialized in automatic reading of cheques and handwriting recognition. After a short passage in finance, he joined Yahoo in 2008 to work on search query rewriting problems by implementing statistical algorithms designed for all languages. In 2010, Xavier joined Microsoft to participate in the local search engine. He contributed to the partnership between PagesJaunes and Bing. Xavier worked on very large scale problems for Microsoft’s search engine Bing. He is now working on Azure Machine Learning. Meanwhile, Xavier Dupré have been teaching programming since 2001 at the ENSAE. The courses have expanded in 2014 to machine learning and technologies associated to big data, including Azure through a partnership between Microsoft France and the ENSAE. More recently, Xavier has explored new ways to teach through hackathons (hackathon Microsoft- ENSAE-Croix-Rouge – November 2015 – video – article), collaborations between academic and non-profitable organization through students projects or coding snack.
