AI Infra Summit at PyTorch Conference
By PyTorch FoundationSeptember 18, 2025No Comments
On October 21st, the AI Infra Summit comes to San Francisco and PyTorch Conference 2025, bringing together experts building the infrastructure behind the latest explosion in AI innovation.
This half-day summit will cover the tools and platforms that drive AI’s rapid progress, including pre and post training, fine tuning, inference time scaling, and model compression and other optimizations. We will share insights on scaling AI workloads efficiently, optimizing training and inference, and the future of AI infrastructure in the era of generative models.
Top 3 Reasons to Attend
Learn how new approaches in infrastructure are making AI more efficient, powerful, and scalable.
Connect with peers who are solving similar challenges and shaping the next generation of AI systems.
Be part of the conversation on where AI infrastructure is headed.
AI Infra Summit Program Highlights
The program is packed with keynotes, technical talks, and panel discussions that explore how infrastructure shapes the future of intelligence. If you care about model optimization, large-scale training, and new execution paradigms, this is the place to learn and connect with the people driving progress.
