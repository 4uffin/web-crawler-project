PyTorch Cloud Credit Program
We believe providing public, self-service, and automated access to cloud infrastructure is essential for every project’s incubation, growth, and success.
To support this, PyTorch has established a program that enables organizations to contribute either cloud credits or financial donations directly towards maintaining and expanding our Continuous Integration (CI) infrastructure and other foundation-hosted project infrastructure. Contributions from organizations like AWS have already provided cloud credits, demonstrating a clear commitment to the success and sustainability of the PyTorch’ Foundation’s hosted projects. Many organizations continue to sponsor PyTorch projects, recognizing that supporting foundational infrastructure contributes directly to their own business growth and success.

How it works
Step 1
Decide how to donate
Cloud credits can be donated via cash or credit:
Credit, for products a sponsor usually sells as a service to the public
Cash, to be earmarked for paying for services when we run out of donated credits
Step 2
Determine the technical points of contact
Projects often need help utilizing credits. We ask that you provide a technical support resource with a defined SLA.
Step 3
Projects benefit from your donation
After getting set up with PyTorch, projects can access these credits via a curated self-service portal, managed by PyTorch.
