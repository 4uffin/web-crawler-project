Join PyTorch Foundation
Become part of a thriving community in the booming global AI market.
According to statistics from MIT Sloan, 75% of top executives believe AI will help their organizations grow and gain a competitive edge. Since 2020, there has been a 14X increase in the number of active AI startups, and venture capitalist-funded startups have increased by 6X. The PwC Global Artificial Intelligence Study indicates that AI has the potential to contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030, with 45% of the total economic gains coming from product enhancements that stimulate consumer demand.
