PyTorch
PyTorch is an open source deep learning framework built to be flexible and modular for research, with the stability and support needed for production deployment.
PyTorch is an open source machine learning framework that accelerates the path from research prototyping to production deployment. Built to offer maximum flexibility and speed, PyTorch supports dynamic computation graphs, enabling researchers and developers to iterate quickly and intuitively. Its Pythonic design and deep integration with native Python tools make it an accessible and powerful platform for building and training deep learning models at scale.
Widely adopted across academia and industry, PyTorch has become the framework of choice for cutting-edge research and commercial AI applications. It supports a broad range of use cases—from natural language processing and computer vision to reinforcement learning and generative AI—through a robust ecosystem of libraries, tools, and integrations. PyTorch is also optimized for performance across CPUs, GPUs, and custom hardware accelerators, including support for distributed training and deployment on cloud platforms and mobile devices.
Whether you’re advancing academic research or deploying AI solutions at enterprise scale, PyTorch delivers the speed, flexibility, and ecosystem support needed to transform ideas into impact.
