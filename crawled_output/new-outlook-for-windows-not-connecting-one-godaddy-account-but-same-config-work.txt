Could someone help me with the following? I’m using Microsoft Outlook Version 1.2025.829.200 (the new WebView2-based Outlook for Windows) on Windows 11, and I have a GoDaddy IMAP email account.
Thunderbird connects successfully to the same account.
In Outlook, when adding the account, I get “Invalid credentials” / “Temporarily unavailable” errors.
Other accounts are getting added proper, only this particular email is not adding
Removing the outlook completely does not remove the accounts from Outlook; old accounts keep reappearing when reinstall.
What I’ve Tried:
Removed accounts from Outlook → Settings → Accounts.
Cleared Windows Credentials Manager entries related to Outlook/GoDaddy servers.
Deleted local cache and profiles:
%localappdata%\Microsoft\Outlook
%localappdata%\Packages\Microsoft.OutlookForWindows*
%appdata%\Microsoft\Outlook
Cleared WebView2 / Edge cache used by new Outlook.
Cleared identity tokens:
%localappdata%\Packages\Microsoft.AAD.BrokerPlugin*
%localappdata%\Packages\Microsoft.AccountsControl*
Cleared Windows Mail / Email & Accounts entries.
Reset/uninstalled Outlook app via PowerShell (Remove-AppxPackage / Remove-AppxProvisionedPackage).
Cleared DeliveryOptimization cache.
Deleted Outlook registry profiles under HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Outlook\Profiles.
Rebooted multiple times.
