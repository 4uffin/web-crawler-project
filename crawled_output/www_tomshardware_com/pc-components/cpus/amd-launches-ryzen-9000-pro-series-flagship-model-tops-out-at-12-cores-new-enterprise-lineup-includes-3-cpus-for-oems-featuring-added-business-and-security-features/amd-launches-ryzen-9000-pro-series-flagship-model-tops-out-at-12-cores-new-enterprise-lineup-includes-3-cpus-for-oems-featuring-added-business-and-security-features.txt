AMD released a bunch of new Zen 3, Zen 4, and Zen 5 processors yesterday, refreshing both existing and older families of CPUs. During this time, the company also silently launched its new enterprise lineup: Ryzen PRO 9000. These include three new SKUs built on the same Zen 5 "Granite Ridge" architecture as the mainline Ryzen 9000 series, but they feature cut-down silicon in favor of enterprise management and security features not present on standard CPUs.First up, we have the Ryzen 5 Pro 9645. It comes with 6 cores and 12 threads, clocked at 3.9 GHz with boost speeds up to 5.4 GHz. Then there's the Ryzen 7 Pro 9745 with 8 cores and 16 threads, featuring the same 5.4 GHz boost clock but a slightly reduced 3.8 GHz base clock. The final model is the Ryzen 9 Pro 9945, which only has 12 cores and 24 threads, clocked at 3.4 GHz and boosting up to 5.4 GHz. Cache levels also remain unaltered in comparison to analogous Ryzen 9000 models.Swipe to scroll horizontallyRyzen PRO 9000SKUCore CountBase Clock / Boost ClockCacheTDPRyzen 9 PRO 994512C / 24T3.4 GHz / Up to 5.4 GHz76 MB65WRyzen 7 PRO 97458C / 16T3.8 GHz / Up to 5.4 GHz40 MB65WRyzen 5 PRO 96456C / 12T3.9 GHz / Up to 5.4 GHz38 MB65WAll three SKUs share the same 65W TDP, despite the standard Ryzen 9 9900X — which the Pro 9945 would be based on — featuring a 120W TDP. But it makes sense given there are 4 fewer cores on the Pro 9945. There are consistent base and boost clock gains over the previous generation Ryzen PRO 7000 series, like a 300 MHz boost clock increase on the Ryzen 5 Pro SKUs. However, the Ryzen Pro 9945 loses 300 MHz in its base clock when compared to its predecessor (3.4 GHz vs 3.7 GHz).

Performance-wise, AMD shared some slides highlighting the improvements these Zen 5-based enterprise processors carry. Even though they're technically not focused on raw numbers, the Ryzen 9 Pro 9945 is reportedly up to 44% faster in Blender and up to 22% faster in other productivity benchmarks, when compared to Intel's Core i7-14700 processor. Moreover, surprisingly, these CPUs will also come with a bundled Wraith Stealth stock cooler
(Image credit: Future)Pricing and availability are not clear because these CPUs are distributed to OEMs that supply them in bulk to enterprises around the world. Ryzen PRO is generally less mature than Intel's competing vPro technology, but both offer similar features with an overlapping goal in mind.Follow Tom's Hardware on Google News, or add us as a preferred source, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

As far as I know, AMD never launched a 16-core model with a TDP of 65W. At least, not on AM5.
That's the issue, here. At 65W (88W PPT), there's just not enough headroom for 16 cores to stretch their legs and deliver a meaningful performance increase sufficient to justify the price.
