I have a code to filter the slicer data based on the last 6 dates currently what I do is find the unique dates from my table and copy and paste them into a list, then I
set a variable for the last 6 (a-f),
then then go through each slicer item and check of it matches a-f
if yes then select
if no then do not select
since there is a lot of date it takes about 45 seconds to a 1 minute for customer and we could have 30 customers to go through along with the rest of the code to run (which takes about another 20-30 seconds per customer)
What I would love to be able to do is select the last X (say 6) items on a Slicer. or a quick way to filter slicer items.
any help would be great, thank you. here is the code I'm using:
With ActiveWorkbook.SlicerCaches("SalesDates")
ThisWorkbook.Worksheets("Data").Activate
LRDates = ThisWorkbook.Worksheets("Data").Range("A1", Range("A1").End(xlDown)).Rows.Count
For Each oSlicerItem In .SlicerItems
a = ThisWorkbook.Worksheets("Data").Range("A" & LRDates)
b = ThisWorkbook.Worksheets("Data").Range("A" & LRDates - 1)
C = ThisWorkbook.Worksheets("Data").Range("A" & LRDates - 2)
D = ThisWorkbook.Worksheets("Data").Range("A" & LRDates - 3)
E = ThisWorkbook.Worksheets("Data").Range("A" & LRDates - 4)
F = ThisWorkbook.Worksheets("Data").Range("A" & LRDates - 5)
ThisWorkbook.Worksheets("Pivot table").Activate
If oSlicerItem.Name = a _
Or oSlicerItem.Name = b _
Or oSlicerItem.Name = C _
Or oSlicerItem.Name = D _
Or oSlicerItem.Name = E _
Or oSlicerItem.Name = F _
Then
oSlicerItem.Selected = True
Else
oSlicerItem.Selected = False
End If
Next oSlicerItem
End With
