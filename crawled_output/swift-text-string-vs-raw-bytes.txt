I gave the following Swift-code to ChatGPT:
let data = text.data(using: .utf8)
It answered me:
"This line takes your string and turns it into raw bytes (data) that can be stored, sent over the network, or written to a file."
The answer confused me more then it helped.
What's the difference between string and raw bytes?
I mean: Strings/Characters are only bits/bytes themself. What's the critical differentiation?

well, why don't you ask it "What's the difference between string and raw bytes?" and "What's the critical differentiation?"
