Intel i915 vs. Xe Graphics Driver Benchmarks For Meteor Lake: Extra Performance In 2025
12 September 10:35 AM EDT - Display Drivers - 13 CommentsLast month I provided a fresh look at the Intel Arc A-Series graphics between the i915 and Xe kernel graphics drivers for Linux systems.

There were some performance advantages for the Arc A-Series if switching over to that newer driver option. Similarly, there are advantages with Meteor Lake too when moving from the i915 to Xe Linux drivers. Here are benchmarks to quantify that advantage.

AMD EPYC 9575F CPUs For GPU/AI Servers Show Leading Performance In Benchmarks
11 September 08:30 AM EDT - Processors - 10 CommentsSince the launch of the AMD EPYC 9005 series nearly one year ago, I have performed hundreds of different benchmarks on these EPYC "Turin" processors across a wide range of workloads/disciplines to really terrific performance, power efficiency, and value. AMD EPYC 9005 performs exceptionally well compared to the competition from Intel and ARM CPU vendors. One area though I hadn't explored to this point was how well the AMD EPYC 9005 series performs for serving as the host CPU for GPU/AI servers. That changed as I recently wrapped up some benchmarks exploring that area using the AMD EPYC 9575F and it managed to accelerate past the available competition in proving capable of being the superior host processor for AI servers.
