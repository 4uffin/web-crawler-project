Three strangers share an obsession with true crime and suddenly find themselves wrapped up in one. When a grisly death occurs inside their exclusive Upper West Side apartment building, the trio suspects murder and employs their precise knowledge of true crime to investigate the truth. Perhaps even more explosive are the lies they tell one another. Soon, the endangered trio comes to realize a killer might be living among them as they race to decipher the mounting clues before it's too late.

What to Know
Critics Consensus
Putting the very fate of the Arconia on the line, Only Murders in the Building's fifth season goes back to the series' fundamentals — its core trio — and reaffirms that their charm hasn't waned one bit.

Ed Power
Daily Telegraph (UK)
Yet far from turning stale, this is one of the strongest series yet, largely because show runners Martin and John Hoffmann lean further into the murder-mystery side of things with deadly intent.

G. Allen Johnson
San Francisco Chronicle
The series likely will never reach the heights of the Broadway-set Season 3, which introduced Streep to the main cast. This season, like last year’s Hollywood-set Season 4, operates more like comfort food.
Rated: 3/4

It's comfort food, something that goes down easily through a blend of breakneck plotting—there’s a new twist every episode—and remarkable starpower. Could it be better? Sure. But sometimes, good enough will do.

Hipertextual
The fifth season of 'Only Murders in the Building' proves that, even though it repeats the formula, its story doesn't lose any of its freshness or humor. [Full Review in Spanish]

Everyone has a great character game to play, and they play it to the rafters. Viewers are given a feast of fun performances that enrich the series instead of feeling like tedious filler.

Entertainment Voice
This series endures because Martin, Short and Gomez seem to have endless energy in reuniting to give these characters quirky life.
