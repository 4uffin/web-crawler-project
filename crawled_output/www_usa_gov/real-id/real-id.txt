How to get a REAL ID and use it for travel
The REAL ID Act is a law that sets higher security standards for state-issued driver's licenses and identification cards (IDs).
How to get a REAL IDWhen you apply for or renew your driverâs license or state identification card, you can choose to make it REAL ID-compliant. When you receive your new card, it will have the REAL ID star marking at the top right.The process of getting a REAL ID and what documents you must provide depends on your state. In most cases, your state driverâs licensing agency will require you to bring:Proof of identity - To prove your identity, you can bring a U.S. birth certificate, U.S. passport, or Permanent Resident Card (Green Card) if you are a non-U.S. citizen.Proof of a Social Security number - You can provide your Social Security card, Form W-2, which shows your earnings for tax purposes, or a pay stub or paycheck from your job.Proof of residency - Your state department of motor vehicles may ask you for a deed, mortgage statement, lease agreement, utility bill, or bank statement to prove you are a state resident.Look up and visit your stateâs driverâs licensing agency website to learn how to apply and what documentation you need.Why upgrade your license to a REAL ID?If you do not have a REAL ID-compliant driverâs license or state-issued ID, you will not be able to use it to:
Board federally regulated commercial aircraft
Access federal government facilities or military installations
Enter nuclear power plants
Visit the REAL ID website for more details and frequently asked questions.Check to see if your license or state ID is already REAL ID-compliantIf your driver's license or state ID has a star in the upper right-hand corner, it is already REAL-ID-compliant. There is nothing more you need to do.Can I fly without a REAL ID?Yes. If you do not upgrade your license or state ID, you can use a passport or one of these other acceptable forms of identification to fly. Can you still get a non-REAL ID-compliant license or state ID?You will still be able to get a driver's license or state ID card that is not REAL ID-compliant. But you will not be able to use it for air travel or to get into federal facilities or military installations. Look up and visit your state's driver's licensing agency website to see how to get a non-REAL ID-compliant license or state ID.
