There's a whole subculture for fonts smaller than 8 by 8, with real world uses for things such as small LED displays, for example.
This is at the extreme end, though.Also https://stormgold.itch.io/picket-right-fontreplyomoikane 8 hours ago

I wonder if there are really tiny fonts that make use of color.
For example, this 2-pixel wide Picket Right font could theoretically be even thinner if we were to use sub-pixel features.At least, I think the 2-pixel high Two Slice font can be more legible with some anti-aliasing.replysedatk 7 hours ago

Don’t stop at colors. Just add a ligature for every string and support for animations and you have yourself a font that can render any alphanumeric string in a single pixel. I’ll need to brush up on Morse code though.replyeichin 6 hours ago

> such as small LED displaysThe highest DPI screen is 127,000 PPI. You could fit over 14,000 lines of 8x8 text in a single inch tall screen.For reference, a decent monitor is 140 PPI.I'm pretty sure we don't need to go below 8x8 if physical size is the issue.replycrq-yml 8 hours ago

Pad grid controllers like the Novation Launchpad, and its indie, open-source counterpart, Mystrix Pro, have an 8x8 grid. At first this style of controller didn't use any lights, but as the manufacturing and features progressed, they went towards one
RGB LED per pad. So, of course, you end up doing some text and graphics on the resulting grid. Mystrix uses a scrolling marquee which isn't ideal, but does get the job done.And yeah, you could throw on more hardware to have a display nearby and use that for text. That is not the problem being solved though.replybongodongobob 7 hours ago

I think readability is helped a lot by the low entropy of English words and sentences, i.e. if you can’t make out one letter, you’ll probably get it anyway from the context.It’s not so readable if you test it with random strings.replykstrauser 7 hours ago

This brings back fond memories from the 8-bit era. Tasword II was a text processor for the Sinclair ZX Spectrum where the developers resorted to extra-narrow fonts to cope with the Speccy's very limited (256x192) screen resolution.
The lower screenshot in [1] provides a glimpse of what seems to be a 3px wide font.OP's 2px width are a bit too extreme for my taste though.[1] https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/entry/4000080/Timex/Tasword_...replymrspuratic 2 hours ago

One of the first Spectrum emulators (JPP?) used a VGA text mode with 2 pixel high font where each character was its own ordinal, i.e. 65 was two rows of 01000001 pixels. That meant you could draw individual rows bytewise exactly as the Spectrum did, and just take care of the Y offset bit shuffle, and fake the colour clash.replyreaperducer 33 minutes ago

Similar to VIP Term on the Commodore 64, which used a 3x7 bitmap font in a 4x8 space to display 80-column text.I don't know is any word processors did that, though, except in printer preview mode.replyK0balt 1 hour ago

White space around each letter is completely critical for fonts like this. That makes this font 4x4 as presented, or 3x4 but you lose a lot of readability—too much imho.The exception to this would be a physical manifestation, where each 2x3 pixel block was surrounded by a dead space, so that the display was actually optimised for this font configuration.Still, that’s an impressive accomplishment, allowing a 16x32 character display on a sub 1$ oled, and 10x18 on a 3$ integrated computer with built in display.Nice work.For anyone actually thinking of using tiny fonts in a practical project, imho 4x5 (3x4 plus padding) is about as small as it gets for a font that doesn’t require extra work to read, giving 1 pixel of (violable) padding bottom and right. Unlike the OP font, it only needs 1px of top padding to be perfectly readable, so you are actually getting “free” readability compared to needing top+bottom padding like the OP font.replygliptic 1 hour ago

Glyph advance or line spacing is not part of the bitmaps.replyK0balt 1 hour ago
| root | parent | next [–]
I get that, but it figures in when you actually put this on pixels. I’m thinking about practical use of such a font, most likely on a pixel-constrained screen, otherwise you would use a higher definition font.It’s a cool hack, and for someone actually using little fonts like I do in real world devices it’s very interesting.I find that you can actually go 4x5 (including padding) and still have great readability. Any less and you have to work to read it.replyDwedit 5 hours ago

| root | parent | next [–]
I think most of what makes this font readable is the user using context to sort of guess at what the word could be.If you start writing things that aren’t sentences normal people would use (or especially if you start mixing case) it doesn’t hold up. Still interesting for a “normal” use case though.replyjasonjmcghee 9 hours ago

Well I think to make fonts like these legible, the trick is to use texts as examples that the readers already know, then you don’t really need to recognize very letter, but just the one here and there to keep up overall recognition. It also helps to focus on letters that are most readable.But tongue in cheek humor aside, this is a neat accomplishment. It’s a great idea to stretch the letters out in width, greatly improves readability. (Earlier approaches Fokus a lot on trying to stay square, which doesn’t really work at this size)replywingmanjd 5 hours ago

I love this. It speaks to me in a similar ways as a lot of the AI zeitgeist—why shouldn’t we optimize for how the brain actually operates at scale versus hundreds-years-old ideas about ligatures designed for reading in candlelight?

The Atari 2600 had pretty good vertical resolution (assuming you could set up the next line in 76 cycles) but limited horizontal resolution. A 3x5 font is possible, but good luck distinguishing N from M.This font seems to use characters up to 5 pixels wide, which helps with its near-legibility.replyDwedit 5 hours ago
| parent | next [–]
The thing to do with a 3x5 font is to make the capital N into a giant lowercase n.
Then M H and W all become similar letters, just with a different location for the horizontal bar.replyboredhedgehog 5 hours ago
