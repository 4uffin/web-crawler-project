Meanwhile, 3x5 fonts are actually usable.replyJdeBP 5 hours ago

There's a whole subculture for fonts smaller than 8 by 8, with real world uses for things such as small LED displays, for example.
This is at the extreme end, though.Also https://stormgold.itch.io/picket-right-fontreplyomoikane 2 hours ago

I wonder if there are really tiny fonts that make use of color.
For example, this 2-pixel wide Picket Right font could theoretically be even thinner if we were to use sub-pixel features.At least, I think the 2-pixel high Two Slice font can be more legible with some anti-aliasing.replysedatk 1 hour ago

That one is relatively easier to read, I guess because it looks like normal font that was cut into strips.replytyppilol 2 hours ago

Thanks for sharing this. I enjoy seeing these cool subcultures; they evoke the hacker ethos.replyJdeBP 7 minutes ago

I’m not a hacker but I really appreciate their ethos. It’s like punk. I’m not punk either. But I will defend it all with my dying breathe.replyhdjrudni 3 hours ago

> such as small LED displaysThe highest DPI screen is 127,000 PPI. You could fit over 14,000 lines of 8x8 text in a single inch tall screen.For reference, a decent monitor is 140 PPI.I'm pretty sure we don't need to go below 8x8 if physical size is the issue.replycrq-yml 2 hours ago

Pad grid controllers like the Novation Launchpad, and its indie, open-source counterpart, Mystrix Pro, have an 8x8 grid. At first this style of controller didn't use any lights, but as the manufacturing and features progressed, they went towards one
RGB LED per pad. So, of course, you end up doing some text and graphics on the resulting grid. Mystrix uses a scrolling marquee which isn't ideal, but does get the job done.And yeah, you could throw on more hardware to have a display nearby and use that for text. That is not the problem being solved though.replybongodongobob 1 hour ago

No, small LED displays with like 25 ppi. Think arduino/embedded.replykstrauser 2 hours ago

Really like that zero glyph. I wonder if, instead of Roman numerals, one could use ligatures to encode numeric strings as binary… 42 as 010101(I sort of randomly picked 42, didn't know it was such an interesting string… Douglas Adams must have known that)replyaddaon 3 hours ago

Capital H is cursed... unconnected pixels, indistinguishable from 'ii' or "II". The concept's cool, but for this one point the wrong choice was made.replyPenguinRevolver 2 hours ago

Try reading "HiGh sky buys The lies" in the font. Pretty difficult to make out what it says...replyjasonjmcghee 3 hours ago

Like all of language: context.Why would hair be like 80s synthpop, or potatoes be in any way related to a by-product of honey?replyJowsey 2 hours ago

Some of the characters/words (particularly "c"/"can") sort of look like they've been cropped from the top, trusting the brain to fill in the bottom half. Reminds me of what Sandisk did with the "S" in their redesign. I wonder if there's any research behind this?replymagackame 2 hours ago

I love this. It speaks to me in a similar ways as a lot of the AI zeitgeist—why shouldn’t we optimize for how the brain actually operates at scale versus hundreds-years-old ideas about ligatures designed for reading in candlelight? (In the AI case, a romanticism for having to learn and prove memory in such a rote way)replymatznerd 3 hours ago

okay but what about "c" being nearly the same as "z", neither of which look like the character and are nearly(?) identical. Is our brain supposed to just be able to figure it out?replysharkjacobs 1 hour ago
| parent | next [–]
O and 0 are very similar in lots of typefaces. And I and l and 1. Even u and v. Your brain's pretty good at figuring it out. Context helps a lot.replycal85 3 hours ago

The Atari 2600 had pretty good vertical resolution (assuming you could set up the next line in 76 cycles) but limited horizontal resolution. A 3x5 font is possible, but good luck distinguishing N from M.This font seems to use characters up to 5 pixels wide, which helps with its near-legibility.replyDwedit 1 minute ago
| parent | next [–]
The thing to do with a 3x5 font is to make the capital N into a giant lowercase n.
Then M H and W all become similar letters, just with a different location for the horizontal bar.replyeipipuz 1 hour ago
