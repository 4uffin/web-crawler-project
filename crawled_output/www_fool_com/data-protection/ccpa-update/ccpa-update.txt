Selling of Personal Information
As a user of our website, you have the right, at any time, to direct us not to sell your personal information
to third parties. This is also known as the right to opt-out of the sale of personal information.
What does “selling to a third party” mean?
When we say, “sell” and “sale” we mean any disclosure or transfer of your data to a third party for that third
party’s benefit instead of one of our own business purposes. If we plan on “selling” your data in this fashion,
we will disclose that fact to you when we collect your personal information and also in our
Privacy Policy.
If I opt-out, what will you do with my data?
If you opt-out of the sale of your information, we will not give it to third parties for their own use. We will
continue to use your data for our business purposes, as we disclose in our
Privacy Policy, including using
service providers to deliver services to fulfill our business purposes. We prohibit these service providers from
using your personal information for any purpose other than to deliver their services to us. They must return or
delete personal information upon the completion or termination of their agreement with us, unless the law
requires they maintain records for a certain additional period.
For more information about our practices for collecting, retaining, disclosing, and using your personal
information, or for information about additional rights you may have regarding your data, see our
Privacy Policy.
Disclosure: We are collecting your email address on this page solely for the purpose of restricting the
sale of the personal information we collect and retain about you.
