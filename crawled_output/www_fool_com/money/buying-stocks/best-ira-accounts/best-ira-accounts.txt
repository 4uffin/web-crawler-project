How to choose the right IRA brokerIn my view, assuming you qualify for an individual retirement account, the most important thing you can do is get one set up and use it. The tax advantages have the potential to make a big difference in your retirement.That said, choosing the right broker for your IRA can make a real difference to both your IRA investing and your long-term savings. Let's consider a few of the key reasons.
Investment optionsNot all IRA brokers offer the same investment options. Even if you use the same broker as your taxable investment account, the options could differ.So one of the first things you need to do is make sure that the investment options for the broker match your needs. For most reputable brokers, you should be able to count on U.S.-listed stocks, ETFs, and mutual funds being available.If your investing mix includes options, individual bonds, crypto, or other less-common investments, you'll want to make sure the broker offers it. Likewise, while most brokers will offer mutual funds, which specific funds and fund providers are available can vary.Fees and commissionsMany brokers these days offer $0 commissions on stock and ETF trades. But that can vary from broker to broker, as well as between taxable accounts and IRAs.The commissions for stock and ETF trades -- whether it's actually $0 or a low fee -- is one fee to consider. But mutual fund fees can vary, so if mutual funds are part of your mix, consider both the fees to buy and sell funds as well as expense ratios for the funds. Fees for options contracts and transacting in crypto can also vary.Outside of the fees for transacting, some brokers may have fees for inactivity, or simply a monthly account fee. Fees for transacting over the phone rather than on web or mobile are also typical. You'll want to take note of all of these ancillary fees to consider how they would add up for you.Retirement planning tools and resourcesMany brokers these days offer significant resources and tools to help investors make investment decisions, plan for retirement, and track their portfolio. Many, but not all.What's important really depends on you and your process, as some tools will be critical for some investors, while others won't use them at all. Common tools and resources include screeners for finding stocks and other investments, investment research, calculators, educational guides, and webinars.User experienceThe platform interface can significantly impact your investing experience. Consider how you'll primarily interact with your account -- if you're an active trader who needs detailed charting and analysis tools, a robust desktop platform might be critical. But if you primarily check balances and make occasional trades, a solid, easy-to-use mobile app might be sufficient.Customer support can be important, but needs vary by investor. Some brokers offer 24/7 phone support with dedicated retirement specialists, while others primarily rely on chat and email. If you want face-to-face interactions, consider whether the broker has physical branches in your area and what services they offer, as branch availability can be particularly valuable when you need help with complex transactions or account services.And for those looking for a more hands-off approach, robo-advisors and hybrid services have evolved significantly. These services typically combine algorithmic portfolio management with varying levels of human oversight, and the best platforms offer customization options that you can fit to your retirement goals while targeting the risk levels you want and tax efficiency. Some hybrid services provide periodic access to human advisors for strategy reviews and major life events.Integration with other banking servicesAccount integration can make your financial management much simpler. Many brokers now offer seamless connections between investment accounts and banking services, which allows quick transfers and the ability to view your accounts holistically on one page.Major banks have aimed to get more customers onto their investing services, sometimes even providing incentives for existing banking customers. These might include preferred pricing on investment services, higher rewards on credit cards, or better rates on banking products. However, while they can be a nice cherry on top, don't let these perks be the sole determining factor -- the quality of the investment platform and available options should take precedence over banking integration benefits.All in all, consider how these features align with your long-term retirement strategy. The best platform for you will be one that provides the tools and services you'll actually use while offering the investment options you need at a reasonable cost.

What is an IRA and why it's important
Individual retirement accounts are designed for retirement savings, and specifically to give a tax-advantaged benefit to savers who use them. IRAs can typically hold a variety of investments including stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, and options. Which means that for most people, investing in an IRA won't feel much different than investing in their standard brokerage account.Types of IRAsTwo main types of IRAs are the traditional IRA and the Roth IRA. Both can be useful accounts, but they have slightly different tax advantages. A couple additional types of IRAs exist as well.
Traditional IRA
A traditional IRA allows you to invest money pre-tax, allowing you to compound your investments on that pre-tax basis. It's generally only when you withdraw your money from a traditional IRA in retirement that you are taxed. For many people, that could mean paying taxes at a lower rate in retirement versus the tax rate during your peak earning years.
Roth IRA
A Roth IRA has essentially the opposite tax advantage. With a Roth IRA, you pay taxes on the money when you earn it, but then are not taxed on any of the gains you make on your investment earnings. This can be particularly advantageous for younger earners in a lower tax bracket who can pay taxes at a lower rate, then let their investments compound over decades, and enjoy those tax-free earnings in retirement.
Other IRAs
SEP IRAs and SIMPLE IRAs are two additional types of individual retirement accounts that are specifically designed for self-employed people or small businesses. These have contribution guidelines that typically allow qualified individuals to contribute more than they would with a traditional or Roth IRA.
Setting up your IRA step by step
Actually opening an IRA is naturally a crucial first step toward building your retirement savings, and the process is typically straightforward. Here's a detailed look at four steps you'll need to follow to get started.1. Gather your personal informationBefore you begin the application process, you'll need to have some personal information at the ready. Normally, this includes your Social Security number, current address, employment information, and basic financial details.2. Select the account typeChoosing which type of individual retirement account -- traditional IRA, Roth IRA, etc -- is one of the most important decisions you'll make when setting up an IRA.As discussed earlier, traditional IRAs offer upfront tax benefits by allowing you to invest pre-tax dollars, with taxes paid when you withdraw your money in retirement. Roth IRAs, on the other hand, are funded with after-tax money but offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. For self-employed individuals, a SEP IRA might be the better choice, as it typically allows for higher contribution limits compared to traditional or Roth IRAs.Making this choice depends on your needs and personal circumstances. Many people may be able to determine this on their own, based on a review of their finances, current tax situation, and future needs. Others may want to consult a finance or tax professional to help them figure out which will make the most sense for them.3. Fund the accountThere are several ways to fund your new IRA, though this can vary a bit depending on the broker you choose. The most common and straightforward method is linking your bank account directly to your IRA. Most brokers make this process simple, often allowing you to set up a one-time transfer to get up and running or recurring transfers for regular contributions.Transferring funds from an existing IRA is another option. While this might require some paperwork, direct transfers between institutions are typically straightforward and can usually be initiated by your new broker. This approach helps avoid any potential tax implications that might arise from receiving a distribution check.4. Choose your investmentsOnce your account is funded, you'll need to select investments. For some investors, this is the fun part, though to others it can sometimes seem overwhelming. The good news is that if you've chosen a top-notch IRA broker, this step can be relatively painless regardless of which side of that spectrum you fall.For experienced investorsFor investors with a newly-funded IRA account, choosing investments will mainly mean populating your new account with investments that align and compliment the rest of your portfolio. That is, making sure that what you buy in your new IRA doesn't throw off the allocations or risk profile across your investment portfolio as a whole.For newer investorsIf this is your first time investing, this means building your portfolio. If you want to get started investing quickly and keep it simple, using low-cost ETFs covering major indexes like the S&P 500 or Wilshire 5000 can be a great way to get diversified quickly while keeping your costs low. Tapping into a robo-advisor if your broker offers one can be another easy quick-start option.Remember that your investment choices can be adjusted over time as your needs and circumstances change. Many brokers offer research tools and educational resources to help you make informed investment decisions as you build and manage your retirement portfolio.
IRA contributions and withdrawals
Contributing to and withdrawing from an IRA requires that you do pay some mind to IRS rules and regulations. While these accounts offer significant tax advantages, they come with specific rules that govern how you can use them effectively for retirement savings.Contribution limitsThe IRS sets annual limits on how much you can contribute to your IRAs, and these limits apply collectively across all your IRA accounts. For 2025, most individuals can contribute up to $7,000 across their traditional and Roth IRAs combined. If you're age 50 or older, you can make additional "catch-up" contributions, bringing your total allowable contribution to $8,000 for the year.Withdrawal rulesIRAs are designed for long-term retirement savings, and the IRS enforces this through its withdrawal rules. Generally, you must wait until age 59 1/2 before taking distributions from your IRA to avoid penalties. Early withdrawals from traditional IRAs typically trigger a 10% penalty on top of any income taxes owed on the distribution.However, there are some exceptions to these early withdrawal penalties. These might include using the funds for a first-time home purchase (up to certain limits), qualified educational expenses, or certain medical expenses. Even when these exceptions apply, you'll still need to pay regular income taxes on distributions from traditional IRAs.
Final thoughts
Individual retirement accounts are one of the most powerful tools available for building long-term wealth for retirement. These accounts combine the potential for investment growth with significant tax advantages, making them a key retirement planning strategy for many Americans.The best brokers offer a combination of low fees, diverse investment options, useful planning tools, and educational resources that can help you make informed decisions about your retirement savings.Remember, don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good -- while it's worth taking time to choose the right broker and investment strategy, the benefits of getting started typically outweigh the advantages of waiting for the "perfect" moment or setup. Consider using one of the top IRA brokers listed here to open your account today and take the first step toward a more secure retirement future.

FAQs
Can I have multiple IRAs?
Yes, you can maintain multiple IRAs across different brokers. Some investors do this to access specific investment options or take advantage of different brokers' features.However, your total contributions across all traditional and Roth IRAs combined still can't exceed the annual IRS limit ($7,000 for 2025, or $8,000 if you're 50 or older). This means you'll need to carefully track your contributions across accounts to avoid excess contribution penalties.
What fees are typical?
While many brokers now offer commission-free trading for stocks and ETFs in IRAs, you should keep an eye out for other fees. These can include contract fees for options trading, load fees or transaction fees for mutual funds, and annual account maintenance fees. Some brokers might also charge for services like wire transfers, paper statements, or making a trade over the phone.When comparing brokers, look at their complete fee schedule to understand the total cost of maintaining your account based on your intended investment strategy. Make sure to do this with your own needs in mind -- if there's a fee for paper statements, but you don't use them anyway, then that fee really shouldn't matter to you.
Am I eligible for tax breaks with an IRA?
The tax advantages of IRAs depend on several factors, including your income, whether you or your spouse participate in a workplace retirement plan, and which type of IRA you choose. For traditional IRAs, the ability to deduct contributions can phase out at higher income levels if you're covered by a workplace plan.Roth IRA contributions are subject to income limits, above which your ability to contribute begins to phase out and eventually becomes restricted entirely. If you're self-employed or have a small business, the rules are also different, so be sure to consult IRS regulations with your specific situation in mind.
Can I contribute if I already have a 401(k)?
Having a 401(k) doesn't prevent you from contributing to an IRA. In fact, maintaining both types of accounts can be an effective way to maximize your retirement savings.However, if you're covered by a workplace retirement plan, your ability to deduct traditional IRA contributions may be limited based on your income level. Roth IRA contribution eligibility is determined by income regardless of workplace plan participation.
Are IRAs safe if my brokerage fails?
IRAs at member firms of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) are protected up to $500,000 per account type if your brokerage firm fails. This includes up to $250,000 in cash.In the fine print at the bottom of their webpage, most brokerages will note that they are SIPC member firms. If you have any doubt, you can confirm with their customer support. It's important to understand that SIPC protection covers the custody of your assets -- making sure they're returned to you if your broker goes bankrupt -- but doesn't protect against investment losses.
Can I lose money in an IRA?
Yes, you can. While IRAs offer tax advantages, they don't protect against market risk. The value of your investments can fluctuate based on market conditions and investment performance. So you could lose money, particularly in the short term.Additionally, withdrawing money before age 59 1/2 typically triggers a 10% early withdrawal penalty on top of any taxes owed, which can significantly impact your account balance. This reinforces the importance of viewing IRAs as long-term retirement savings vehicles rather than short-term investment accounts.
