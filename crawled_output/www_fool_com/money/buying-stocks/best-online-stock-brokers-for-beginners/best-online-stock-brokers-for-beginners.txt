What to consider when choosing a beginner brokerage accountChoosing the right brokerage account is a crucial first step in your investing journey. There are five main factors to evaluate when selecting a beginner-friendly account. Below, we'll break down each factor and explain what to look for, followed by insights into how the brokerages on our list measure up.
As you compare options, keep in mind how well a brokerage aligns with your long-term financial goals and whether it can grow with you as you gain experience.1. Trust and brand recognitionThe most important factor when choosing a brokerage is trust. After all, no amount of savings on fees matters if your money isn't in a secure and reliable place. Every brokerage on our list has been thoroughly vetted and is SIPC insured, providing coverage for up to $500,000.When assessing trustworthiness, consider brands you already know -- especially if you bank with them, as they may offer seamless integration. If in-person assistance is important to you, focus on brokerages with physical branches.2. Platform usabilityThe platform's usability can make or break your experience. A well-designed platform should be intuitive, modern, and easy to navigate -- especially for beginners. While some platforms are sleek and app-focused (e.g., Robinhood), others cater more to desktop users.Consider how you'll primarily interact with your account. For instance, while I use my brokerage's app to monitor my investments, I prefer the desktop version for executing trades. If you're a beginner, features like customizable charts, trade simulators, or advisory tools can be invaluable in helping you learn and make informed decisions.3. FeesThe best beginner brokerages prioritize affordability by eliminating trading fees and monthly account fees. It's 2025 -- you shouldn't have to pay just to let your money work for you.One standout feature to look for is fractional share trading, which allows you to invest with small amounts of money. This flexibility is especially helpful for beginners, enabling you to invest in high-value stocks without needing to buy full shares.4. Investment optionsDiverse investment options are essential, particularly for beginners. Ensure the brokerage supports stock trades and mutual funds or ETFs, as these are the most common starting points for new investors.Looking ahead, consider whether the account can accommodate your evolving strategies. Does it support more advanced features like options trading? Can you open specialized accounts, such as IRAs or custodial accounts, as your needs grow? A scalable platform will save you the hassle of switching brokerages down the road.5. Educational resourcesFinally, prioritize brokerages with robust educational resources. Investing can be daunting, but access to tutorials, articles, and webinars directly within the platform can help you build confidence and skills faster.Look for platforms that offer beginner-friendly guides, explain financial concepts in plain language, and provide tools to simulate trades or practice strategies. A solid educational foundation will set you up for long-term success.

Trust and brand reputationSoFi®, widely known for its student loans and banking services, also offers a trustworthy and reliable brokerage account. If you're already a SoFi® banking customer, adding a brokerage account can simplify your financial management.However, keep in mind that SoFi® is an online-only platform, so its customer service experience is crucial. While phone support is unavailable on weekends, they make up for it with 24/7 chat support, which can be a lifesaver when you need quick assistance.PlatformSoFi®'s platform is one of the simplest that we've found. While it lacks the advanced features of some competitors, its streamlined design makes it ideal for beginners who want a no-frills experience. If your primary focus is straightforward stock and ETF investing, SoFi® provides everything you need without unnecessary complexity.FeesSoFi® has no commission fees for stocks or options, no account minimums, and no annual fees.¹ This makes it an excellent choice for beginners who want to maximize their investments without worrying about commissions.That said, there are some fees to be aware of: a $25 inactivity fee per account for 12 months of login inactivity and a $100 fee for full or partial outgoing transfers. These charges are notably higher than what many other brokerages on this list impose, so consider whether these fees might impact your plans.Investment optionsSoFi® offers a well-rounded selection of investment options. You can choose between self-directed trading and automated robo-advising services. In addition to trading stocks and ETFs, SoFi® allows you to invest in IPOs at IPO prices -- an uncommon feature that sets it apart.² Fractional share trading is also available, which is perfect for beginners looking to start small and diversify their portfolio without significant upfront costs.³ (See disclosures.)Educational resourcesSoFi® shines in the educational department with its SoFi® Learn section, a comprehensive guide to financial literacy. This resource doesn't just cover investing basics -- it also provides insights into credit cards, insurance, budgeting, home buying, and more. As our pick for Best All-In-One Financial App, it offers far beyond investing.Another standout feature is access to financial planners, a fantastic benefit for beginners who may need personalized guidance.⁶ These planners can help create a holistic financial plan that goes beyond investing, covering all aspects of your financial health.

Trust and brand reputationFidelity is a name synonymous with investing, even for those new to the market. Founded in 1946, it brings decades of expertise and a reputation for reliability. Fidelity also stands out by offering physical branches, allowing investors to meet face to face with advisors -- an invaluable feature for those who prefer in-person support.If a trusted brand with a proven track record and robust customer service is a top priority, Fidelity is an excellent choice.PlatformFidelity's platform is straightforward, offering just enough information to make informed decisions without being overwhelming. While it may not have the ultra-modern aesthetics of newer platforms like Robinhood, its reliability and functionality are consistently high.Compared to its closest competitor, Charles Schwab, Fidelity's online platform edges out with a cleaner and more user-friendly experience, making it particularly well-suited for beginners.FeesFidelity is a leader in low-cost investing. It offers $0 commission trades for stocks and ETFs, and its no-transaction-fee mutual funds set it apart from many other brokerages. Plus, Fidelity is as cheap as it gets when it comes to miscellaneous expenses like closing IRA account fees and account transfer fees (both $0).One thing to note is that Fidelity charges $49.95 for redeeming no transaction fee, non-Fidelity funds within 60 days of buying them -- so hold onto them to avoid that.Investment optionsFidelity provides a diverse selection of investment options, including stocks, ETFs, mutual funds, and specialized accounts such as IRAs and 529 college savings plans. One of its standout features is the no-transaction-fee mutual funds, which allow you to invest with low costs and achieve broad diversification -- perfect for building a well-rounded portfolio. These options, along with the ease of access and flexibility, make Fidelity an excellent choice for beginners looking to grow their investments.Educational resourcesFidelity excels in educational resources, offering tools like free in-depth reports from over 20 independent research firms, StarMine analyst rating analysis, and daily market insights. Its robust screeners for stocks, funds, and ETFs make it easy for investors to find opportunities tailored to their goals. These features are invaluable for beginners and seasoned investors alike.

Trust and brand reputationRobinhood revolutionized the investing world by popularizing commission-free trading, attracting younger, tech-savvy investors with its intuitive and accessible app. However, the platform faced criticism in 2020 due to system outages during periods of market volatility and in 2021 for freezing trades on GameStop during the stock's highly publicized rally.Since then, Robinhood has worked to rebuild its reputation, addressing past issues and enhancing its platform. With over 10 million users now relying on Robinhood as their primary brokerage, it remains a popular choice for beginner investors seeking a straightforward entry point into the market.PlatformRobinhood is renowned for its simple, beginner-friendly app, which makes navigating and managing investments easy. In October 2024, the company introduced Robinhood Legend, a desktop platform designed for advanced traders. This addition gives users room to grow by offering access to enhanced charting tools, technical indicators, and other advanced features, while retaining the app's hallmark simplicity for beginners.This dual approach ensures that Robinhood accommodates both novice investors and those looking to expand their trading capabilities.
FeesRobinhood led the way in commission-free trading, making it an excellent platform for new investors who want to start trading without worrying about fees eating into their gains. There are no account minimums or annual fees, further cementing its reputation as an affordable option. There is a $100 fee to transfer from Robinhood to an outside brokerage.Investment optionsRobinhood focuses on the essentials, allowing users to invest in stocks and ETFs. Fractional share trading is a standout feature, enabling users to buy into high-value stocks for as little as $1.However, Robinhood's investment options are limited compared to some competitors. The platform does not offer mutual funds or many alternative investments. If these are important to your strategy, you might consider other brokers like Charles Schwab or Fidelity, which provide more diverse offerings.Educational resourcesRobinhood offers an educational hub called Robinhood Learn, which provides accessible content on the basics of investing. This resource is great for beginners looking to build foundational knowledge.That said, Robinhood's in-app research tools are relatively basic unless you upgrade to Robinhood Gold, which provides access to advanced research and data. If deep analytical tools and comprehensive research options are a priority, other platforms may better meet your needs.

Navigating the investment waters: Risk assessment and portfolio diversificationInvesting can feel a lot like setting sail across a wide-open ocean. Just like a savvy captain adjusts course based on weather patterns, every investor needs a strategy to handle the inevitable risks and steer their portfolio toward long-term success. Luckily, that's where we at The Motley Fool thrive.Risk assessment: Understanding your toleranceBefore you start investing, it’s important to take a moment and reflect on your own risk tolerance. Are you cool with the market's rollercoaster ride, or do the smallest drops leave you in a cold sweat?Conservative: These investors prefer to play it safe, favoring low-risk options like bonds and stable, dividend-paying stocks.Moderate: Looking for balance, moderate investors split their assets between stocks, bonds, and other investments for steady, long-term growth.Aggressive: Ready to go big, aggressive investors focus on higher-risk, high-reward opportunities, like tech stocks and small-cap companies, hoping for bigger returns.Building a diversified portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basketSmart investors don’t put all their eggs in one basket -- and neither should you. Diversification is key to weathering market storms, so spread your investments across different assets, sectors, and regions.Asset allocation: This is the core of diversification. It’s about balancing your stocks, bonds, real estate, and other assets to match your risk tolerance and investment goals.Sector diversification: Spreading your investments across different industries -- like tech, healthcare, and energy -- helps protect you from risks tied to any one sector.The importance of rebalancingYour financial situation -- and your risk tolerance -- might shift over time. That’s why regularly rebalancing your portfolio is crucial. It ensures that you stay on track to meet your investment goals while keeping the risk at the level you’re comfortable with.A note of cautionWhile diversification is a smart strategy, it’s not a magic bullet. Even the best-diversified portfolios can take a hit in a market downturn. Just remember, it's all about balancing risk with reward and staying focused on the long-term horizon.By understanding your risk tolerance and building a diversified portfolio, you'll be better prepared to navigate the unpredictable waters of the stock market and reach your financial goals -- come rain or shine.
