How to pick the right mortgage lender for you
Follow these six steps to find the best mortgage lender for you.Step 1. Check your credit scoreA higher credit score could help you save money over the long term with a lower interest rate on your mortgage. Check your credit score before you apply. You may be able to check it for free by logging onto your bank or credit card dashboard. Otherwise, find a free credit score website.If your score isn't where you want it to be (and especially if it's close to the cutoff for a lender's lower rate), take steps to improve it. The two most important things you can do for your score are pay your bills on time and keep credit card debt low.Step 2. Determine your loan amountBefore selecting a mortgage lender, have a sense for how much you can borrow. A good affordability benchmark for your total housing payment is 28% of your monthly gross (before taxes) income. Your housing payment includes the principal and interest, your homeowners insurance, property taxes, and your homeowners association fees, if any.If the dollar amount seems too high for your budget, you can aim for a smaller loan and smaller payment. Even if you're approved for a bigger loan, you don't have to commit to a payment that would make your financial life hard.Now that you have the monthly payment amount in mind, use a mortgage calculator for your state to figure out how much you could borrow. The amount you can borrow will depend on mortgage interest rates and how much you pay for property taxes, insurance, and HOA fees, so you'll want to play around with the numbers a little.Step 3. Ask about interest ratesYour mortgage rate will depend on your credit score, your down payment, the loan type, and the lender. Even a small difference in rates can have a big impact on how much you end up paying every month and overall.When lenders quote rates, be sure to ask how many mortgage discount points you would have to pay to get the quoted rate.Step 4. Choose a lender offering the terms you wantVirtually all mortgage lenders offer 15-year mortgages and 30-year mortgages, but not everybody wants those terms. You could get a lower interest rate by choosing a different term, or reach some other goal. For instance, maybe you plan to retire in 23 years and you want your loan to be paid off by then. Explore the different term options with all of the lenders you talk to.Step 5. Look for lenders with lower closing costsClosing costs are charges for things like the property appraisal, prorated property taxes, a credit report fee, a title search fee, and so on. These could total 2% to 6% of your total loan amount.Step 6. Get prequalified or pre-approvedGetting prequalified can give you a general estimate of the mortgage rate you might qualify for, without hurting your credit score. A hard credit check for pre-approval could knock a few points off your credit score, but should give you a more accurate rate estimate.
What is a mortgage lender?
A mortgage lender is a bank, credit union, online lender, or other financial institution that provides a loan to purchase real estate.
Are there different kinds of mortgages?
How do I compare mortgage lenders?
Once you've found a few mortgage lenders you love, it's time to compare them. There are a few factors that are important to compare to make sure you find a home loan that fits your situation.How quickly do you need to be pre-approved? Some mortgage lenders specialize in quick mortgage pre-approval, while others may take a little longer.What are the lender's rates? Different lenders offer different mortgage rates, so be sure to compare them before settling on one.Does the lender charge any fees? Most lenders charge some fees, like origination fees and closing costs; some charge low or no fees. Make sure you read the fine print to understand what you'll pay.When you're ready to apply for a loan, it's a good idea to apply with multiple lenders on the same day. After you apply, they are each supposed to give you a document called a loan estimate. The loan estimate is a standard form, so they'll all look the same even if they are from different lenders.This tells you all the information about the loan you're being offered, including closing costs. If you apply with multiple lenders, you can compare the loan estimates and see how the closing costs stack up against each other.
How do I qualify for a home loan?
Many factors go into qualifying for a mortgage. In general, lenders like to see a good credit score, a down payment, and consistent income. They also prefer that all your monthly debt payments -- housing included -- add up to less than half of your monthly income.If you don't check all those boxes, don't worry. Look at different mortgage types and talk to lenders -- many are flexible to different situations.

How can home buyers feel more confident when choosing a mortgage lender?As with any large-ticket item purchase, the more information you have to make a decision the more confident you are with your choice. Due to the size of the mortgage industry in the U.S. there are many lending platforms and mortgage information sites on the internet. I searched for "mortgage rates" and ended up with 674 million results. For comparison purposes, searching for "NFL" brought up 496 million results. Granted, this could result in decision paralysis with this much information. I would recommend starting with your current bank/credit union, and include other lenders from [review] sites. It is likely the lender you choose will end up selling your loan through the mortgage-backed securitization process. So focus on lower rates and fees. Customer service is less under your control.How do changing interest rates affect mortgages in different communities?The loan decision is standardized in the mortgage market due to the participation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (two government-sponsored enterprises that buy and sell about half of U.S. mortgages). FICO® Score, current income, and availability of money for a down payment are the most important factors. The efficiency of the mortgage market works against underserved communities where the ability to build a prime FICO® Score (above 720) can be more difficult. If you do not have the opportunity to build a credit history then it is more difficult to obtain an affordable mortgage. Therefore, the issue for underserved communities is the opportunity to create a solid credit history.What's one tip you would give to members of underserved communities looking to get the best mortgage rate possible?Building a credit history is the key. This starts with on-time payment of bills (utilities, cable, cellphone) and then moves on to other opportunities like credit cards. Utilizing a credit card as a debit card, for only small-ticket purchases that can be paid off in full every month, also helps build credit. There are also programs through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's FHA program targeted directly at helping underserved communities become homeowners.

How can homebuyers feel more confident when choosing a mortgage lender?
First, ever since the financial crisis in 2008, a number of measures were taken to strengthen and improve oversight of mortgage lending practices in the industry.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
(CFPB) was established in part to address many of the deficient and sometimes predatory lending practices that occurred at that time.
As a result, mortgage lenders, even those nonbank mortgage entities that are not regulated as closely as commercial banks and other depositories at the federal level must comply with all applicable federal state and local laws regarding mortgage lending.
Generally, in shopping around for a lender you can trust, I would look at their track record in terms of complaints which are available at the CFPB Consumer Complaint Database. References from friends and family are another good way of benchmarking lenders in terms of how they handled the loan process.
Regulated depositories, according to my research, tend to have far less operational problems in loan origination than nonbank financial institutions in terms of how they follow the process required to underwrite borrowers for Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac-eligible loans.
So that might be another factor to consider as well.How do changing interest rates affect mortgages in different communities? We are approaching the end of a very long secular decline in interest rates that has spanned decades.
At some point we expect the Fed to begin the process of taking measures that will start to raise interest rates including US Treasuries.
Since the 10-year US Treasury yield is the benchmark for setting 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rates, we should expect that higher rates are going to dampen demand for mortgages at some point.
Lower income borrowers, including minority borrowers, are going to feel the impact first of higher interest rates which will further put the dream of homeownership out of reach during a period of time when there are acute housing affordability issues already.What's one tip you would give to members of underserved communities looking to get the best mortgage rate possible?I'll offer a few tips.
The first is one that every borrower needs to do first.
Check your credit score and credit history through one of the readily available credit reporting companies and services and find out if there are any issues that you can address prior to applying for a mortgage.
The second tip is look at your current finances.
Add up all your outstanding monthly debt including credit card, student debt and the like and divide that by your monthly income. The lower that debt-to-income ratio is, the better chance you have at getting a loan.
Also, determine how much money you have to put down on a home.
Make sure you leave yourself with enough cash or short-term assets that you can tap for an unexpected event and for home maintenance.
If you are a first-time homebuyer, do some homework or take a class on what to expect in owning a home.
These activities can really help put you in good shape to find the right home and mortgage for your family.

How can home buyers feel more confident when choosing a mortgage lender?It is important for home buyers to undertake sufficient search to obtain quotes from various prospective lenders before selecting one -- especially given the range of pricing that can arise. They also should try potentially to clarify the servicing process with the lender (or even check with other borrowers of the lender about their experience, if feasible).How do changing interest rates affect mortgages in different communities?The decline in interest rates has contributed to high house prices and loan values, as buyers would bid more aggressively.What's one tip you would give to members of underserved communities looking to get the best mortgage rate possible?I would reinforce my advice (above) -- it is very important for home buyers to undertake ample search so as to ensure that they are receiving favorable pricing on their loans as underserved communities are especially vulnerable to attempts to exercise market power. This may be at the heart of the meaning of a community being "underserved."

How can home buyers feel more confident when choosing a mortgage lender?The first thing to understand about home lenders is that many of the companies that advertise mortgage loans are not really lenders. They are brokers. The money is not coming from them -- it is coming from a lender (to whom the broker takes the loan). As an example, I financed my last mortgage through Right Choice Mortgage. However, the loan was made to me from Glendale Credit Union.The second thing to understand is that even if you go directly to a lender, the lender may still act as a broker. A lender, such as Bank of America, could give you a mortgage. But they could just as easily "sell off" the mortgage to a group of investors in the mortgage aftermarket. Why? Because this frees up the bank's capital to make more loans.Who you choose to help you obtain a mortgage really depends on two things: 1) Your personal financial situation and, 2) What sort of relationship you want with a mortgage lender. If you have a complex personal financial situation, such as having multiple sources of income, being self-employed, having investment properties, and owning LLCs, or previous bankruptcies, you may find that some mortgage companies don't want to bother working with you (because it will take more time and effort to get your mortgaged approved). Also, many of the large automated or semi-automated mortgage companies where you apply online don't have the right "boxes" on their application for you to explain everything. You can end up in a quagmire of endless frustration working with these companies.Even if you have a straightforward financial situation, you still must decide what sort of relationship you want with the mortgage company. Are you okay doing everything online or do you need to fill out forms by hand? Do you want to speak to the same person every time or are you okay with talking to whichever one of the hundreds of people in the call center answers the phone? Do you need someone who can walk you through the process and explain things to you, or are you an old "mortgage pro" who understands how the system works? Making the right decision will make your mortgage application process a whole lot easier.Whoever you choose to work with to get a mortgage, before getting in too deep, find out how they do business and if their style fits in with your needs. Finally, if you do use one of those online brokers, if you can't find the phone number on the home page, don't use them.How do changing interest rates affect mortgages in different communities?Interest rate changes affect home buying. When interest rates drop, homes become more affordable because loan payments go down. As an example, if you purchased a home for $600,000 (the average price of a home in California) and put 20% down, you would have a $480,000 mortgage. At 3% interest your payment before taxes and insurance would be $2,024. At a 5% interest rate, your payment would be $2,577, or 27% higher. As lenders typically look for your cost of housing to be no more than 30% of your income, lower interest rates should allow more people to get mortgages, and higher interest rates will restrict mortgages.However, changes in mortgage interest rates do not affect all communities the same. Obviously very rich people, who may still mortgage their homes for tax or financial planning purposes, have few restraints on their ability to get a mortgage. At the lower end of the scale, the least expensive house may continue to sell well when interest rates rise because there are many programs to help underserved and first-time buyers. FHA loans are specifically intended for lower-income, lower-credit, and/or first-time home buyers. This program, which is backed by the Federal Housing Administration, makes it easier to become a homeowner by relaxing the standards borrowers must meet to get a mortgage.The communities that get hit hardest (or benefit the most) when interest rates change are those communities where the home prices are above average, but not high enough to be of interest to rich people. As an example, in California, that might include communities where the home prices are in the $1 million to $1.5 million range. I recall the recession of 2008, when the value of real estate dropped substantially, there was still demand for the least expensive houses and still demand for mega-mansions of the rich. But those million-dollar homes couldn't find many buyers.What's one tip you would give to members of underserved communities looking to get the best mortgage rate possible?I offer three tips to members of underserved communities to get the best rates possible. First, do whatever you can to improve your credit score. Even in underserved communities credit scores are one of the primary indicators of credit worthiness used by our financial system.Second, work with a bank or lender that is familiar with all the programs that are available to underserved communities. Some mortgage companies may not want to use these programs because they may be extra work. Find a mortgage company who can talk frankly to you about those programs that are available and that you can use to your benefit.Finally, make sure the mortgage company knows that you are a member of an underserved community. Today when we do a lot of business online or on the phone, it may be difficult for the lender to know that you are member of an underserved community which under the broad-based definition recently provided by the White House is said to include "people of color and others who have been historically underserved, marginalized, and adversely affected by persistent poverty and inequality." That definition covers a lot of people.

How can home buyers feel more confident when choosing a mortgage lender?The most effective way is to get quotes from multiple lenders. Time consuming as it is, the extra work pays off with leverage in your discussions with those lenders. If you know what other lenders are offering, each lender is likely to try to match or beat the rates you are getting with other lenders.Another way is to obtain a mortgage from the bank or credit union where you have your checking or savings accounts. Such lenders sometimes offer discounts to their account holders.You can also compare the rates lenders are offering to national benchmark rates, such as those published by Freddie Mac.How do changing interest rates affect mortgages in different communities?I think changing interest rates have similar impacts across communities. When interest rates fall, they generally fall for all borrowers.What's one tip you would give to members of underserved communities looking to get the best mortgage rate possible?Many issues surrounding loans to members of underserved communities stem from issues with credit scores and credit reports. My one tip is to obtain the free credit report to which you are entitled by law and review it for inaccuracies before applying for a mortgage. If there are errors in your credit report, correcting them will improve your credit score, which in turn could get you a lower interest rate.
FAQs
What credit score do you need to get a mortgage?
Most mortgage lenders set the minimum credit score for a mortgage at around 620. But some loans, including a VA loan, have no minimum credit score requirements at all. Other government-backed loans, such as FHA loans, are available to applicants with lower scores.Keep in mind that if your application is strong in other areas, it's easier for the lender to be flexible with your credit score. For instance, it'll help if you have a bigger down payment.
How do I find a better mortgage rate?
To find the best mortgage rates from the best mortgage lenders, get quotes from as many lenders as possible. Look for lenders that allow you to check rates with only a soft credit check. Soft credit checks don't affect your credit score. Compare rates and fees to assess total costs of borrowing.If you want the best loan at the most competitive rate, the following can help:Increase your credit scorePay down your other debtChoose a shorter loan termMake a larger down payment
Are mortgage loans secured loans?
Mortgages are secured loans. A secured loan is guaranteed by collateral (something the lender can take if you fail to repay the loan). On a mortgage, the real estate is the collateral. Collateral lowers the risk for the lender, and in turn the lender can charge less for the loan.
