Breakfast News: Baidu Booms on LLM Goals
September 17, 2025
Tuesday's Markets
S&P 5006,607 (-0.13%)
Nasdaq22,334 (-0.07%)
Dow45,758 (-0.27%)
Bitcoin116,771 (+1.26%)
1) AI Deal Sends Baidu Higher
Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) jumped 9% in overnight trading, on top of a 7.8% gain yesterday, after the Chinese tech giant sealed a new partnership with state-owned China Merchants Group in its accelerating artificial intelligence (AI) drive."Both sides plan to focus on applications of large language models, AI agents and 'digital employees'": Baidu, the leader in China's search engine market, spoke of plans for "scalable and sustainable progress in industrial intelligence."Advances in factuality and agentic capabilities: Baidu had earlier announced Ernie X1.1, its latest AI reasoning model, claiming its performance beats DeepSeek and matches OpenAI's GPT-5 and Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Gemini 2.5 Pro.
2) Fed Set to Cut Rates
Investors' eyes are on the Federal Reserve meeting that concludes today, expecting it to produce the first interest-rate reduction of the year. The money is on a 25-basis-point cut, though most expect new Fed appointee Stephen Miran to back something bigger. The CME FedWatch tool indicates a chance of a 50-point cut at just 4%."The goals of the Fed's dual mandate are in 'tension' and are likely to become more so going forward": John Velis at BNY (NYSE:BK) points to the conflicting goals facing the Fed after Chair Jerome Powell hinted at Jackson Hole that tackling unemployment could be growing in priority."The key questionâ€¦is whether the committee will signal that this is likely the first in a series of consecutive cuts": David Mericle at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) expects the Fed's dot plot -- its quarterly chart showing each member's prediction -- will signal two cuts in 2025 rather than three.
3) U.K. Tech Deals Reach $42 Billion
The U.S. and U.K. have agreed on a technology partnership to boost cooperation in AI, quantum computing, and nuclear energy, as President Donald Trump arrived on his second state visit. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) -- pledging $30 billion -- joins Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Alphabet, OpenAI, and Rule Breakers recommendation Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) in the new $42 billion "Tech Prosperity Deal.""Truly make the UK an AI maker, not an AI taker": Nvidia's David Hogan enthused as the company, in partnership with Britain's Nscale, plans to use up to 60,000 Grace Blackwell Ultra chips to help build the country's biggest AI supercomputer."Next-generation biopharma factories and laboratories in the United States": As part of growing trade deals, Britain's GSK (NYSE:GSK) will invest at least $30 billion in research and development (R&D) in the U.S., including plans to advance AI-based manufacturing.
4) TikTok Sale Set to Go Ahead
Further details are emerging regarding the sale of TikTok's U.S. operations to a consortium led by Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), ahead of a discussion between President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping set for this week.ByteDance stake to fall below 20%: According to Bloomberg, venture capital firms Andreessen Horowitz and Silver Lake will join Oracle as part owners, with a new U.S.-based app under development."Mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation": China's People's Daily praised the plans, adding that China will review TikTok's technology and intellectual property.
5) StubHub Joins IPO Surge
Online ticket reseller StubHub has set the pricing of its initial public offering (IPO) at $23.50 per share, with trading expected to commence today under the ticker "STUB" -- raising $800 million and valuing the company at $8.6 billion.Success at third try: StubHub had seen two previous attempts to go public shelved, the most recent derailed by President Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs shock.IPO market surging: Recent public offerings, including Klarna (NYSE:KLAR) last week and Bullish (NYSE:BLSH) last month, got off to winning starts.
