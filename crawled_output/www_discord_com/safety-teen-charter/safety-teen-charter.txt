Chill TogetherCreated with teens, for teens.This may come as a surprise,but the person writing these words is not a teen.So while weâre not experts in what it feels like to be a teen right now, we are experts in building digital spaces where you and your friends can play and chill. And because youâre great at knowing what itâs like to be you, a teen, we have worked closely with teen users globally (30+ focus groups!) to understand what matters most to make your experiences safe.Teen CharterThis set of principles represent the expectations teens have of each other and of Discord. Whether youâre new to Discord or a long time user, this charter is key to keep in mind and hold each other and us accountable to - so everyone can have a safe experience. These principles will help inform product and policy improvements that make Discord a better place to play and chill.

Come as you areAuthenticityOn Discord, you should feel empowered to share the version of yourself that you feel most comfortable being. All teens have the right to find community and to engage in safe spaces as themselves.
Take space, make spaceInclusivityTeens should feel that they can express their thoughts and opinions and support other teens to do the same. On Discord, you should be able to express yourself freely as long as it doesnât end up harming someone else.
What's yours is yoursPrivacyWe believe you should be in control of how much personal information you share on Discord. Teens also have a responsibility to protect each otherâs information too; this may look like asking before sharing someone elseâs information.
Know the Discord deetsTransparencyWe want you to have a clear understanding of how Discordcollects, and uses, and protects your information, how content moderation decisions are made, and how youraccount status can be impacted. It's on us to make sure you continually feel like you know what's going on.

When you donât have to think about protecting yourself, then weâre doing our job.We heard from teens that some of you have developed skills to make an assessment and take action to keep yourself safe. Know that you donât have to do it alone - we have your back and work endlessly to keep you safe while protecting your privacy.recognizing poor formSee if you can guess which examples are acceptable and in line with our Community Guidelines, Terms of Service, or other policies.
