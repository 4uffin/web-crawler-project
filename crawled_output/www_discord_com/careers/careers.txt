Questions?Questions about our hiring process? Check out our frequently asked questions.View All QuestionsHow old do you have to be to work at Discord?
At least 18 years old. If you are under 18, unfortunately we cannot hire you!Are you hiring interns?
We often hire interns for various roles across the company, aligned to the summer intern recruiting season. Please feel free to check back in on the âinternshipsâ section of our jobs page. If you donât see anything there (or the âinternshipsâ category itself), that means we donât currently have any roles open.What states do you hire in? Do I have to live in San Francisco to work for Discord?
While we have no requirement to work from the office, weâre hiring most roles in the SF Bay Area to foster a vibrant central hub in the region. For most roles, candidates will need to reside in or be willing to relocate to the San Francisco Bay Area (Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, Napa, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Solano, and Sonoma counties). Not every role requires candidates to be based in the SF Bay Area. In some cases, we continue to hire from across the U.S. Your recruiter can share more about location expectations for the role youâre interested in.Where are your offices located?
We have one office in San Francisco and one in Amsterdam.What countries do you hire in?
The majority of our roles are US based. We are also able to hire folks in Canada, but only in Ontario, Quebec, and British Columbia at the moment. We also have a few specialized roles in the Netherlands! Each job posting will state the location requirement, so be sure to review all the details in the description.Does Discord sponsor employees?
Discordâs immigration policy includes:Continued sponsorship for any candidate with a current O-1, TN, E-3, H-1B1, or H-1B visa, provided they are eligibleSponsorship of new TN or E-3 visas for Mexican/Canadian or Australian candidatesSponsorship of Green Card for employees after 6 months of employmentContinued sponsorship of the Green Card process after 3 months of employment for candidates who have already received their priority dateIf you have any questions about these policies, be sure to connect with your recruiter should you be selected to interview!I submitted an application, when will I hear back from a recruiter?
Thanks a ton for applying! We do our best to respond to each person who applies within two weeks. Given the incredibly high number of applicants to some roles, we cannot guarantee each candidate will get a response directly from a recruiter. We appreciate your patience!Iâm interested in a role at Discord, can I speak to a recruiter or hiring manager about it?
Weâre hyped youâre interested! Recruiters and hiring managers are unable to meet with everyone whoâs interested due to time constraints, but also to ensure a fair and equitable hiring process! The best thing to do is apply for the role and the team will be sure to take a look.Can I apply to multiple positions at a time?
You can! Although, we recommend that you apply only to the roles you are most interested in and qualified for. Please note that you may hear back at different times for each role you apply to, and you can expect a separate update for each role.I saw a job posting I was interested in, but I no longer see it on the careers page. What does this mean?
This could mean a variety of things - ranging from high applicant volume that needs to be reviewed, to the role already being filled. Keep an eye on the jobs page for any similar roles, or the role being posted again!Where are your offices located?
We have offices in San Francisco and Amsterdam! We are a hybrid company and treat our internal staff Discord server as our HQ.What do I need to know before my interview?
If youâre selected to interview, your recruiter will share all the details you need to know about the entire interview process - including how to prepare for each stage. Donât hesitate to ask questions!Do I have to write a Cover Letter?
Double check the job description to see if one is required! Itâs never a bad idea to write a cover letter, since it gives us a chance to get to know you better.What if I get an error when trying to apply?
Applicants sometimes run into one of these errors:500 Internal Server ErrorâWell this is awkward. There was a problem submitting your application. Please try again or hit up our team at jobs@discordapp.comâIf you see one of these, we recommend these solutions:Try accessing the application by using an alternate browser such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, or Opera.Use an incognito browser tab to see if that resolves the issue.If you run into an error regarding uploading an html or word doc, try uploading a PDF instead!If Iâve been referred, do I also need to formally apply?
