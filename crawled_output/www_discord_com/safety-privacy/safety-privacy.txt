App StoreDiscord PrivacyÂ HubBecause privacy is an essential part of feeling safe.Our Privacy PrinciplesWe created Discord to be a platform that brings people together over shared experiences. Not everyone uses Discord in the same way â from small, private groups to large servers around shared interests. Users have different expectations of privacy in each space, and your information may be treated differently depending on the space youâre in. Across Discord, we build privacy into our products, and we keep you informed about what's happening with your data. Here are our guiding principles:Youâre in controlStronger privacy starts with putting you in control of your experience. Whether thatâs limiting the information Discord collects about you, or deciding who can chat with you or what content you see, itâs up to you.Youâre not the productWe donât sell your personal information. Our business is based on subscriptions and paid products, not from selling your personal information to third parties. Know that on Discord, whatâs yours is yours.Less data, more transparencyWe want you to always have a clear understanding of whatâs happening with your personal information on Discord, whether thatâs through our Privacy Policy, in the app, or right here on our site. Â We work hard to limit the information we collect in the first place. When your data is no longer needed, we anonymize it, aggregate it, or delete it. And we make third-party integrations play by the same rules.With data comes great responsibilityCollecting, storing, and using any kind of data is a big deal and we donât take it lightly. Your information is only private if itâs secure, and we invest heavily in securing our systems. We believe itâs important to build both privacy protective measures into our architecture and features everyone can use to stay both safe and private.Privacy Preserving ProductsWe approach everything we make with privacy principles in mind from the very start, take extra measures to keep you safe, and put you in control of your experience with privacy settings.Learn MorePrivacy PoliciesOur Privacy Policies goes into all the details about how we collect, use, store, protect, and share your personal information.Applicant and Candidate Privacy PolicyPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyRegional Privacy PoliciesTerms of ServiceRetention PolicyData Privacy ControlsDiscord Data Package
