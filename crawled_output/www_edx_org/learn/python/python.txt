Discover how this popular programming language can open doors to creativity, innovation, and career growth — as well as how to get started — in our guide.What is Python?Python is a popular programming language used to build machine learning (ML) algorithms, analyze data, develop software, automate processes, and more. It's an essential competency in many careers. Learning Python can help newcomers break into the industry and help professionals advance in their careers.Because its syntax — the keywords, variables, and other elements — is mostly formatted in plain English, Python is considered a beginner-friendly programming language. Victoria Southall, an IT professional with over 15 years of experience, says its "clean and intuitive" syntax helps beginners focus on logic, rather than rules."Python is versatile enough to be used in real-world scenarios, keeping learners motivated and building skills that can scale," she says.Southall also notes that Python is the leading programming language for automation processes, data analysis, and visualization.Python is used by data analysts, software engineers, web developers, and ML engineers, among other tech professionals.
