Everyone can access it, but its structure prevents unauthorized modifications or fraudulent entries. Each entry is a tamper-proof record or "block" of information connected to the previous transaction by a complex string of numbers called a cryptographic hash.Knowing how to work with blockchain can open up a variety of positions for you in security and contracts. As more industries begin to use blockchain to verify products and agreements, blockchain skills may translate to more job opportunities.Why should you learn blockchain?Blockchain development isn't just a record of cryptocurrency transactions — it's also a transformative method of storing anonymous data. As the technology progresses and people find new uses for it, more businesses will likely adopt some form of blockchain security. Therefore, blockchain skills may qualify you for increasingly essential roles.Other benefits of learning blockchain include:Gaining worldwide skills: Blockchains are decentralized, meaning they operate through networks worldwide. Learning blockchain may lead to global opportunities.Creating a flexible career: Many industries, such as supply chain management, healthcare, and finance, use blockchain technology, making the skill highly transferable.Becoming an innovator: Blockchain technology is a fairly recent invention with many capabilities for discovery. Learning blockchain can help you innovate tech spaces.How to get started in blockchain technology1. Learn front-end developmentYour journey to learning blockchain technology may begin with front-end development. Front-end development involves coding the part of a website that the user interacts with, including UI, UX, and page elements.Many people begin learning blockchain with front-end development because coding languages like CSS, Javascript, and HTML are instrumental in communicating with the blockchain. Once you understand general coding languages, you can explore Solidity, the primary language for smart contracts.Dive into the basics of computer science with Harvard CS50 on edX to learn about front-end development and other computer science basics.2. Understand smart contract anatomyUsing blockchain technology requires an understanding of smart contract anatomy. This code automates the algorithms necessary for immediate approvals of changes to the blockchain.Smart contracts run the input data through an algorithm that assesses its qualities. If the input meets certain qualifications, each blockchain member has a smart contract that approves the data, and the blockchain will change accordingly. The approval process, along with cryptographic hashing, is what makes blockchain technology so secure.3. Set up a blockchain and deploy smart contractsBlockchain involves many processes that make it anonymous and secure. These essential processes include:Oracles: Oracle networks are third-party programs that enable communication between blockchain and the real world.Security: Learn the standard practices, like fuzz-testing and time-tested tools like Manticore, that can help you keep your blockchain technology secure.Management: Management platforms like Ethereum, IBM Blockchain, and OpenZeppelin offer frameworks for operating blockchain applications and technology.After developing each process, you can upload it to a control system and hosting service and test the code.Featured blockchain coursesHow to choose the best blockchain program for youWhat are your goals for learning blockchain? edX offers various learning opportunities that can help you qualify for new job opportunities, explore new business ventures, or find investment opportunities.Courses: Courses can build skills in blockchain for beginners who are taking their first steps into the field, or for industry veterans looking to hone their knowledge or talents in a specific area.Certificates: Blockchain certificates can help advance your career or facilitate your pivot to a new one.Executive Education programs: For those with professional experience, especially in leadership roles, blockchain Executive Education programs on edX can provide insight into important blockchain concepts and their implications for industries.Degrees: A full computer science or cybersecurity degree program can provide the foundation for many jobs in the technology field, and an advanced degree can open up high-paying positions and leadership roles.Jobs that use blockchain technologyYou can find blockchain jobs in industries like finance, supply chain management, and even healthcare.

It involves inputting information into an algorithm and "hashing" it into a fixed-length, anonymized output.When you cryptographically hash an input, the output is identifiable as having gone through that specific algorithm, but doesn't include any information about the transaction. It's statistically unlikely that anyone can decode the information after it has been hashed.In blockchain technology, cryptographically hashed information is stored in a database. This database is saved to many computers, but all must match to verify an entry, a process that secures the validity of blockchain transactions.How long does it take to learn blockchain?Understanding the basics of blockchain can take as little as a few weeks. Becoming a blockchain developer may take longer, however, depending on your familiarity with programming and complex algorithms.How hard is it to learn blockchain?The difficulty of learning blockchain depends on your learning goals and previous experience with related material. If you want to learn blockchain basics to make decisions in your workplace, it may take you just a few weeks or a single course. However, if you want to actively work with and develop blockchain, it may take longer.Last updated June 17, 2025Browse CoursesLearn AILearn ChatGPTLearn SpanishLearn PythonLearn ExcelLearn Software EngineeringLearn BlockchainLearn Computer ProgrammingLearn EconomicsLearn ArchitectureLearn Project ManagementLearn Business Administrationsee more CoursesStep-by-step guidesBecome a Cybersecurity AnalystBecome a Data ScientistBecome a Social Media ManagerBecome a Software DeveloperBecome a Software Engineersee more GuidesComplete your bachelor's onlineBachelor's in BusinessBachelor's in Computer Science / Data ScienceBachelor's in Health and NursingBachelor's in AccountingBachelor's in FinanceBachelor's in PsychologyBachelor's in Public HealthBachelor's in Social Worksee more Undergraduate DegreesEarn your online graduate degreeMaster's in Business AdministrationMaster's in Public HealthMaster's in Social WorkMaster's in NursingMaster's in Data ScienceMaster's in EngineeringMaster's in Speech PathologyMaster's in CounselingMaster's in HealthcareMaster's in EducationMaster's in AIMaster's in Computer Sciencesee more Graduate Degreessee more Doctorate DegreesedxPartner With UsAboutedX For BusinessAffiliatesOpen edX2U Advisory CouncilCareersNewsConnectIdea HubContact UsHelp CenterSecurityMedia KitLegalTerms of Service & Honor CodePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyAccessibility PolicyTrademark PolicyModern Slavery StatementSitemapYour Privacy ChoicesChoose your languageEnglishSpanishApply© 2025 edX LLC.
