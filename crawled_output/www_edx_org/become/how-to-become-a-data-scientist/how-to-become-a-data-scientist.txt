Explore educational paths, essential skills, and certifications to begin a career in machine learning and AI.Browse online data science programs and coursesAre you thinking about jumping into the in-demand field of data science? If you're looking to upskill or change careers entirely, this guide will walk you through the most important steps to become a data scientist.What does a data scientist do?Data scientists are digital detectives who interpret the stories hidden within collected data. They blend their math and statistical know-how with programming skills to help companies make smarter business decisions.Data scientists help identify trends, fine-tune algorithms, and analyze customer usage. They commonly work in industries like technology, finance, marketing, healthcare, biotechnology, retail, commerce, and even professional sports.According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), data scientists earn a median annual salary of $108,020 as of May 2023.Steps to become a data scientistWhile there's no one-size-fits-all path to becoming a data scientist, these steps can make the move easier:Step 1: Earn a relevant degreeMany data scientist positions require formal education. Nearly all data scientists have at least a bachelor's degree in computer science, statistics, mathematics, or a related field. As competition gets tighter for entry-level roles, however, many employers seek applicants with a master's or doctorate degree in more specialized areas like artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science or analytics.If your math skills are a bit shaky or you're still figuring out artificial intelligence or machine learning, online courses can help break down these concepts and teach you how to apply them.Step 2: Master essential programming languagesThe most widely used programming languages for data scientists are Python and R. It may be best to begin with Python, as it's more beginner-friendly and has excellent tools for data work. Then, consider learning R for its statistical analysis abilities.You'll also want to get familiar with Pandas for optimizing datasets and NumPy for crunching numbers.Step 3: Develop your data analysis toolkitData scientists have many tools of the trade to help them collect, analyze, interpret, and visualize data, including:SQL: to store and manage dataTableau or PowerBI: to visualize large datasetsJupyter Notebooks: to explore and interact with dataGit: to keep track of changes in source codeCloud platforms (AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure): to build and deploy machine learning modelsGithub: to showcase your skills through an online portfolioStep 4: Learn machine learning fundamentalsMachine learning is an essential skill for data scientists that requires both advanced math and computer science skills. Consider starting simple with basic supervised learning, where you essentially teach a computer to make predictions. Then, let computers find patterns on their own through unsupervised learning.Deep learning will require tools like scikit-learn and TensorFlow. For each learning stage, practice by using real-life data from Kaggle.Step 5: Gain practical experience and build your portfolioKnowing the theory is nice, but data scientists must prove they can actually do the work. Here's a potential game plan:Jump into open-source projects (It's like a practice arena for coders.)Enter Kaggle competitions (Friendly competition can be a strong motivator.)Build projects that solve real problems (This is often what employers want to see.)Share your work on Medium or LinkedIn (This can let you show off your expertise.)Network with other data scientists (Get the inside scoop on their day-to-day.)Get started on edXWhether you're looking to dip your toes in through an introductory course or go all-in on a degree program, edX's learning opportunities in computer data sciences will fit your schedule and help you reach your career goals as a data scientist.Stand out in your fieldUse the knowledge and skills you have gained to drive impact at work and grow your career.Learn at your own paceOn your computer, tablet or phone, online courses make learning flexible to fit your busy life.Earn a valuable credentialShowcase your key skills and valuable knowledge.Explore all online data science programs and courses Frequently asked questionsWhat is a data scientist?A data scientist uses math, statistics, and various computer software and technologies to store and analyze large amounts of data to find insights that help businesses improve their product or processes.How much does a data scientist make a year?Data scientists earn a median annual salary of $108,020 as of May 2023, according to the BLS. The highest 10% of data scientists earned over $184,090 in 2023.How long does it take to become a data scientist?If you already have a relevant bachelor's or master's degree, it can take one to two years to get familiar with the skills and technology required in data science. If you are already confident with coding or statistics, you could become a data scientist in roughly 6 to 12 months.Browse CoursesLearn AILearn ChatGPTLearn SpanishLearn PythonLearn ExcelLearn Software EngineeringLearn BlockchainLearn Computer ProgrammingLearn EconomicsLearn ArchitectureLearn Project ManagementLearn Business Administrationsee more CoursesStep-by-step guidesBecome a Cybersecurity AnalystBecome a Data ScientistBecome a Social Media ManagerBecome a Software DeveloperBecome a Software Engineersee more GuidesComplete your bachelor's onlineBachelor's in BusinessBachelor's in Computer Science / Data ScienceBachelor's in Health and NursingBachelor's in AccountingBachelor's in FinanceBachelor's in PsychologyBachelor's in Public HealthBachelor's in Social Worksee more Undergraduate DegreesEarn your online graduate degreeMaster's in Business AdministrationMaster's in Public HealthMaster's in Social WorkMaster's in NursingMaster's in Data ScienceMaster's in EngineeringMaster's in Speech PathologyMaster's in CounselingMaster's in HealthcareMaster's in EducationMaster's in AIMaster's in Computer Sciencesee more Graduate Degreessee more Doctorate DegreesedxPartner With UsAboutedX For BusinessAffiliatesOpen edX2U Advisory CouncilCareersNewsConnectIdea HubContact UsHelp CenterSecurityMedia KitLegalTerms of Service & Honor CodePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyAccessibility PolicyTrademark PolicyModern Slavery StatementSitemapYour Privacy ChoicesChoose your languageEnglishSpanishApply© 2025 edX LLC.
