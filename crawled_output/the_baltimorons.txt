On Christmas Eve, Cliff, a down-on-his luck comedian who can't catch a break, chips a tooth, and suddenly finds himself in the late-night care of Didi, a sharp-witted, no-nonsense dentist. What should have been a quick fix unfolds into an unforgettable night of unexpected twists, comic mishaps, and a brewing heartfelt connection. Their holiday misadventures lead to the discovery that the best gifts aren't under the tree--they're the ones you never saw coming.

Critics Consensus
Like the most delightful of stocking stuffers, The Baltimorons is modestly-sized but incredibly winning with its outsized charm.

Yet the story manages to put a smile on your face from time to time, despite the gloom of its humor.
Rated: 2.5/4

It’s light on its feet but gradually gathers real emotional weight. It’s also beautifully shot and steeped in atmosphere. We walk away from it feeling like we’ve actually been somewhere and felt something.

Associated Press
One of those little movies you might stumble across and be surprised that it hooks you. It does so despite -- or more likely because -- of its complete lack of flashiness or any self-evident attempt to “hook you.”
Rated: 3/4

WBGR-FM (93.7 FM - Monroe, WI)
This is just a great character study within the holiday spirit, and both actors deliver the scenario with just enough hilarity and pathos to minimize the schmaltz. Strassner is a reminder of prime John Belushi, and Larsen connects with joy. Duplass! Xmas!
Rated: 4.5/5

A fun, sweet movie about unexpected connection and being true to your dreams. Written by a guy who clearly knows and loves Baltimore, it was a treat as a native living far from home, to see my city as the backdrop for such a nice film.

Very believable characters with real chemistry.
Seeing 34th street in Baltimore used a backdrop was a plus.
