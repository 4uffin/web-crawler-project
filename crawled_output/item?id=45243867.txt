> The researchers found that new cases of diabetes were significantly higher in the cannabis group (1,937; 2.2%) compared to the healthy group (518; 0.6%).We know there's a path from obesity to diabetes.
I think it would be interesting to see if there's a path from cannabis to obesity.replyklipt 51 minutes ago

You would think that's the mechanism, but there seems to be evidence that points to lower BMI with cannabis use.Mouse study: https://medschool.uci.edu/news/new-research-may-explain-why-...Human study: https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/can.2024.0069Many people might have removed alcohol intake with cannabis use, to reduce overall caloric intake.replySparkle-san 27 minutes ago

I wonder if this is skewed by the states where marijuana was legal/more accessible during that time window. Colorado was the first state to legalize it and is also the state with the lowest BMI.replyzoklet-enjoyer 6 minutes ago

I don't know why this isn't talked about that often, but a lot of people who smoke weed end up needing to smoke weed to be able to eat. Which probably is part of the thing that leads to reduced BMI.replytapoxi 19 minutes ago

Speaking from personal experience I went from a BMI of 24 (healthy) to a BMI of 31 (obese) because of daily cannabis use that gave me insane munchies.This may be genetic, I had friends that didn't get them nearly as badly as I did.(I have since quit weed and lost the weight.)replydyauspitr 36 minutes ago

There’s also something to cannabis potentially messing with your metabolism because anecdotally potheads usually aren’t particularly fat.replycaboteria 43 minutes ago

I wonder if this is connected to the appetite the cannabis consumption brings about. I personally experienced appetite from consuming it but learned that not acting on it is equally pleasant. Maybe I have more self control or something...replyhomeonthemtn 1 hour ago

Wonder if cannabis triggers blood sugar level changes which causes the munchies.I have funky blood sugar issues, and I can certainly see the overlap in how the cravings feel but never made the connection until now. Very interesting.replyAngryData 40 minutes ago

There does seem to be an effect on blood sugar levels, but apparently not in a simple way because studies struggle to get consistent results. It seems like it lowers it a little bit, atleast at first, but many people spend far more time with excess sugar levels, possibly due to eating in response.Anecdotally it always seemed to me that it didn't make you that hungry straight out, but it did depress the feeling of satiation after eating so it is much easier to binge on food once you start eating something.replyFade_Dance 44 minutes ago

Seems to me that that would have been known/measured by now if it was the case. Fairly easy to measure.replyklysm 35 minutes ago

Exactly what is going on here appears to be more complicated than that.
For example: https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/325050Title: Marijuana users less likely to be overweight or have obesityOpening line: New research finds that, despite the common phenomenon of having “the munchies” after using marijuana, cannabis users tend to weigh less and are less likely to be obese.This involved 33k participants in the US, so at least one order of magnitude smaller and in a different context.replyimchillyb 1 hour ago

> The authors note that more research is needed on the long-term endocrine effects of cannabis use and whether diabetes risks are limited to inhaled products or other forms of cannabis such as edibles.This study did not differentiate between edibles, which are loaded with sugar, and inhaled cannabis usage.
And, since they are not a food product, edibles do not carry the same onus as food for labeling, nor similar regulatory oversight.This seems a significant flaw in the data gathering and could change the ultimate conclusion of the study.replyyosame 54 minutes ago

Edibles wouldn't have enough sugar to singularly cause diabetes.replycactusplant7374 54 minutes ago

Is it really possible to get diabetes from eating one piece of candy every day?replyleptons 55 minutes ago
| parent | prev | next [–]
Not all edibles have sugar, but most seem to be pure candy. It's dangerous too because if the edible tastes so amazing you want to eat another one and then you get way too high. That's why when I used to make "magic brownies" I would make two batches, one of them "plain", so I could eat those after eating the magic one.Level Protabs are pretty amazing, so clean and zero sugar. It's literally just THC and a little bit of corn starch pressed into a pill. I break them in half and it gives me a focused creativity boost.replygabrielhfrn 51 minutes ago

When you frame it that way, it almost brings the study's findings into question!I wonder if it was truly a flaw or if it was a calculated omission.reply
