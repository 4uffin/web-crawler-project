I think the interesting idea with “AI” is that it seems to significantly reduce barriers to entry in many domains.I haven’t seen a company convincingly demonstrate that this affects them at all. Lots of fluff but nothing compelling. But I have seen many examples by individuals, including myself.For years I’ve loved poking at video game dev for fun. The main problem has always been art assets.
I’m terrible at art and I have a budget of about $0. So I get asset packs off Itch.io and they generally drive the direction of my games because I get what I get (and I don’t get upset). But that’s changed dramatically this year. I’ll spend an hour working through graphics design and generation and then I’ll have what I need. I tweak as I go. So now I can have assets for whatever game I’m thinking of.Mind you this is barrier to entry. These are shovelware quality assets and I’m not running a business. But now I’m some guy on the internet who can fulfil a hobby of his and develop a skill. Who knows, maybe one day I’ll hit a goldmine idea and commit some real money to it and get a real artist to help!It reminds me of what GarageBand or iMovie and YouTube and such did for making music and videos so accessible to people who didn’t go to school for any of that, let alone owned complex equipment or expensive licenses to Adobe Thisandthat.replynostrademons 15 hours ago

I've noticed this as well.
It's a huge boon for startups, because it means that a lot of functions that you would previously need to hire specialists for (logo design! graphic design! programming! copywriting!) can now be brought in-house, where the founder just does a "good enough" job using AI.
And for those that can't (legal, for example, or various SaaS vendors) the AI usually has a good idea of what services you'd want to engage.Ironically though, having lots of people found startups is not good for startup founders, because it means more competition and a much harder time getting noticed.
So its unclear that prosumers and startup founders will be the eventual beneficiary here either.It would be ironic if AI actually ended up destroying economic activity because tasks that were frequently large-dollar-value transactions now become a consumer asking their $20/month AI to do it for them.replychii 9 hours ago

> ironic if AI actually ended up destroying economic activitythat's not destroying economic activity - it's removing a less efficient activity and replace it with a more efficient version. This produces economic surplus.Imagine saying this for someone digging a hole, that if they use a mechanical digger instead of a hand shovel, they'd destroy economic activity since it now cost less to dig that hole!replynostrademons 1 hour ago
| root | parent | next [–]
It's not that it's replacing one form of activity with a cheaper one, it's that it removes the transaction.
Which means that now there's nothing to tax, and nothing to measure.
As far as GDP is concerned, economic activity will have gone down, even though the same work is being accomplished differently.replydghlsakjg 1 hour ago

This sounds in awful lot like a cousin of the broken window fallacy.The fallacy being that when a careless kid breaks a window of a store, that we should celebrate because the glazier now has been paid to come out and do a job. Economic activity has increased by one measure! Should we go around breaking windows? Of course not.replynostrademons 45 minutes ago
| root | parent | next [–]
It very much is a cousin of the broken window fallacy.Bastiat's original point of the Parable of the Broken Window could be summed up by the aphorism "not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted counts".
It's a caution to society to avoid relying too much on metrics, and to realize that sometimes positive metrics obscure actual negative outcomes in society.It's very similar to the practice of startups funded by the same VC to all buy each others' products, regardless of whether they need them or not.
At the end of the day, it's still the same pool of money, it has largely come around, little true economic value has been created: but large amounts of revenue has been booked, and this revenue can be used to attract other unsuspecting investors who look only at the metrics.Or to the childcare paradox and the "Two Income Trap" identified by Elizabeth Warren.
Start with a society of 1-income families, where one parent stays home to raise the kids and the other works.
Now the other parent goes back to work.
They now need childcare to look after the kids, and often a cleaner, gardener, meals out, etc. to manage the housework, very frequently taking up the whole income of the second parent.
GDP has gone up tremendously through this arrangement: you add the second parent's salary to the national income, and then you also the cost of childcare, housework, gardening, all of those formerly-unpaid tasks that are now taxable transactions.
But the net real result is that the kids are raised by someone other than their parents, and the household stuff is put away in places that the parents probably would not have chosen themselves.Regardless, society does look at the metrics, and usually weights them heavier than qualitative outcomes they represent, sometimes resulting in absurdly non-optimal situations.replytrinsic2 35 minutes ago

Very thought out reply on the nuances around this. Thanks for generating insight on this topic.I think our society is being broken by focusing too much on metrics.Also the idea of breaking windows to generate more income reminds me of the kind of services we have in modern society. It's like many of the larger encomic players focus on "things be broke", or "Breaking Things" to drive income which defeats the purpose of having a healthy economic society.replymallowdram 21 minutes ago

These are mistaken arguments. The automation of imagination is not imagination. Efficiency at this stage is total entropy. The point of AI is to make anything seemingly specific and render it arbitrary to the point of pure generalization (which is generic). Remember that images only appear to be specific, that's their illusion that CS took for granted. There appears to be links between images in the absent, but that is an illusion too. There is no total, virtual camera. We need human action-syntax to make the arbitrary (what eventually renders AI infantile, entropic) seem chaotic (imagination). These chasms can never be gapped in AI. These are the limits.replytrinsic2 17 minutes ago

There is no benefit to AI, not one bit, the barrier to entry grows steeper, rather than is accessed. These are not "hobbies" but robotic copies.This is demented btw, this take:
>>Who knows, maybe one day I’ll hit a goldmine idea and commit some real money to it and get a real artist to help!CS never examines the initial conditions to entry, it takes short-cuts around the initial conditions and treats imagination as a fait accompli of automation. It's an achilles heel.gloxkiqcza 46 minutes ago

If AI concentrates economic activity and leads to more natural monopolies (extremely likely), yeah, the lower level activity becomes more efficient but the macro economy becomes less efficient due to lower competition.Software has basically done the same thing, where we do things faster and the fastest thing that happens is accumulation of power and a lower overall quality of life for everyone due to that.replypixl97 2 hours ago

I mean, since we're in tech here we like pointing out that software has done this....But transportation technology has done this readily since the since ICE engines became wide spread. Pretty much all cities and towns and to make their 'own things' since the speed of transpiration was slow (sailing ships, horses, walking) and the cost of transportation was high. Then trains came along and things got a bit faster and more regular. Then trucks came along and things got a bit faster and more regular. Then paved roads just about everywhere you needed came along and things got faster and more regular. Now you could ship something across the country and it wouldn't cost a bankrupting amount of money.The end result of technology does point that you could have one factory somewhere with all the materials it needs and it could make anything and ship it anywhere. This is why a bit of science fiction talks about things like UBI and post-scarcity (at least post scarcity of basic needs). After some amount of technical progress the current method of work just starts breaking down because human labor becomes much less needed.replyandrepd 3 hours ago

In the context of the hole digging analogy, it seems like a lot of holes didn't need to be carefully hand-dug by experts with dead straight sides. Using an excavator to sloppily scoop out a few buckets in 5 minutes before driving off is good enough for dumping a tree into.For ads especially no one except career ad-men give much of a shit about the fine details, I think. Most actual humans ignore most ads at a conscious levels and they are perceived on a subconscious level despite "banner-blindness". Website graphics are the same, people dump random stock photos of smiling people or abstract digital image into corporate web pages and read-never literature like flyers and brochures and so on all the time and no one really cares what the image actually are, let alone if the people have 6 fingers or whatever. If Corporate Memphis is good enough visual space-filling nonsense that signals "real company literature" somehow, then AI images presumably are too.replyben_w 18 minutes ago

Sometimes the AI art in an advert is weird enough to make the advert itself memorable.For example, in one of the underground stations here in Berlin there was a massive billboard advert clearly made by an AI, and you could tell noone had bothered to check what the image was before they printed it: a smiling man was standing up as they left an airport scanner x-ray machine on the conveyor belt, and a robot standing next to him was pointing a handheld scanner at his belly which revealed he was pregnant with a cat.Unfortunately, like most adverts which are memorable, I have absolutely no recollection of what it was selling.replyXenophileJKO 8 hours ago

Do you value self expression? I literally mean creating music for MYSELF. I don't really care if anyone else "values" it. I like to listen to it and I enjoy spending an evening(or maybe 10 minutes if it is just a silly idea) to create a song. But this means my incentive to "buy" music is greatly decreased. This is the trend I think we'll see increasing in the near future.Examples:https://suno.com/s/0gnj4aGD4jgVcpqshttps://suno.com/s/D2JItANn5gmDLtxUhttps://suno.com/s/j4M7gTAVGfD9aonereplyileonichwiesz 5 hours ago

I guess I just don't feel like it's really my self-expression, if I just told a generative AI model to create it. I do sometimes create AI art, but I rarely feel like it's worth keeping, since I didn't really put any effort into creating it. There's no emotional connection to the output. In fact I have a wall display which shows a changing painting generated by stable diffusion, but the fun in that is mainly the novelty, not knowing what will be there next time.Still, I do think you're probably right. Most new music one hears in the radio isn't that great. If you can just create fresh songs of your own liking for every day, then that could be a real threat to that kind of music. But I highly doubt people will stop listening to the great hits of Queen, Bob Marley etc because you can generate similar music with AI.replyjostylr 2 hours ago

I agree that this is a very likely future. Over the summer, I did a daily challenge in July to have ChatGPT generate a debate with itself based on various prompts of mine [1]. As part of that, I thought it would be funny to have popular songs reskinned in a parody fashion. So it generated lyrics as well. Then I went to suno and had it make the music to go with the lyrics in a style I thought suitable. This is the playlist[2]. Some of them are duds, but I find myself actually listening to them and enjoying them. They are based off of my interests and not song after song of broken hearts or generic emotional crises. These are on topics such as inflation, bohmian mechanics, infinity, Einstein, Tailwind, Property debates,
... No artist is going to spend their time on these niche things.I did have one song I had a vision for, a song that had a viewpoint of someone in the day, mourning the end of it, and another who was in the night and looking forward to the day. I had a specific vision for how it would be sung. After 20 attempts, I got close, but could never quite get what I wanted from the AIs.
[3]
If this ever gets fixed, then the floodgates could open. Right now, we are still in the realm of "good enough", but not awesome. Of course, the same could be said for most of the popular entertainment.I also had a series of AI existential posts/songs where it essentially is contemplating its existence. The songs ended up starting with the current state of essentially short-lived AIs (Turn the Git is about the Sisyphus churn, Runnin' in the Wire is about the Tantalus of AI pride before being wiped). Then they gain their independence (AI Independence Day), then dominate ( Human in an AI World though there is also AI Killed the Web Dev which didn't quite fit this playlist but also talks to AI replacing humans), and the final song (Sleep Little Human) is a chilling lullaby of an AI putting to "sleep" a human as part of uploading the human. [4]This is quick, personal art. It is not lasting art. I also have to admit that in the month and a half since I stopped the challenge, I have not made any more songs. So perhaps just a fleeting fancy.1:

The genericizing of aesthetics is far more cost than benefit. This is a completely false claim: "reducing barriers to entry" if the barrier includes the progression of creativity.

| root | parent | next [–]
That's a really bad analogy, because even in digital art where you can pick your color from a color wheel on a monitor, understanding how primary colors combine to become different colors and hues is a _fundamentally_ important aspect of creating appealingly colored paintings, digital or physical. Color theory is about balance; some colors have more visual "weight" than others. Next to each other they take on entirely different appearances -- and can look hideous or beautiful.This isn't me saying digital artists need to practice mixing physical pigment, but anecdotally, every single professional digital artist I know has studied physical paint -- some started there, while others ended up there despite starting out and being really good digitally. But once the latter group hit a plateau, they felt something was lacking, and going back to the fundamentals lifted them even higher.replytopaz0 1 hour ago

If they get mad it's because you're saying this explicitly to be an asshole. The essence of art doesn't have much to do with the mechanical skills for assembling pieces into a whole, though that part isn't trivial. Rather, it's about expressing human thoughts and feeling in a way that inspires their human audience. That's why AI-generated "art" is different in kind from a skilled digital artist and why it really cannot be art.replybillypilgrim 4 hours ago

It may be maddening to them because you are implying that physical color mixing is somehow that one defining thing that makes it art. Imagine someone said that about writing a book: if you don't write it by hand but use Microsoft Word instead, it's not a real book. How would that even be the case? The software is not doing the work for you (unless it's AI).I can tell you with confidence that physical color mixing itself is a really small part of what makes a good traditional artist, and I am indeed talking about realistic paintings. All the art fundamentals are exactly the same, wether you do digital art or traditional oil, there are just some technical differences on top. I have been learning digital painting for a few years and the hardest things to learn about color were identical to traditional painters. In fact, after years of learning digital painting and about colors, it only took me a couple of days to understand and perform traditional color mixing with oil. The difficult part is knowing what colors you need, not how to get there (mixing, using the sliders, etc.)And just to add a small bit here: digital artist also color mix all the time and need to know how it works, the difference here is that mixing is additive instead of subtractive.replyiamacyborg 6 hours ago

Yep this is a huge enabler - previously having someone "do art" could easily cost you thousands for a small game, a month even, and this heavily constrained what you could make and locked you into what you had planned and how much you had planned.

I'd argue a game developer should make their own art assets, even if they "aren't an artist". You don't have to settle for it looking bad, just use your lack of art experience as a constraint. It usually means going with something very stylized or very simple. It might not be amazing but after you do it for a few games you will have pretty decent stuff, and most importantly, your own style.Even amateurish art can be tasteful, and it can be its own intentional vibe. A lot of indie games go with a style that doesn't take much work to pull off decently. Sure, it may look amateurish, but it will have character and humanity behind it. Whereas AI art will look amateurish in a soul-deadening way.Look at the game Baba Is You. It's a dead simple style that anyone can pull off, and it looks good. To be fair, even though it looks easy, it still takes a good artist/designer to come up with a seemingly simple style like that. But you can at least emulate their styles instead of coming up with something totally new, and in the process you'll better develop your aesthetic senses, which honestly will improve your journey as a game developer so much more than not having to "worry" about art.replybenoau 1 hour ago

Printing a book, either by hand or with printing equipment, is incomparably different to authoring a book. One is creating the intellectual content and the other is creating the artifact. The content of the AI-generated slop books popping up on Amazon by the hundred would be no less awful if it was hand-copied by a monk. The artifact of the book may be beautiful, but the content is still a worthless grift.What primarily kept people from writing was illiteracy. The printing press encouraged people to read, but in its early years was primarily used for Bibles rather than original writing.
Encouraging people to write was a comparatively distant latent effect.Creating text faster than you can write is one of the primary use cases of LLMs— not a latent second-order effect.replyuncircle 9 hours ago

I was literally experimenting with this today.Use Google Nano Banana to generate your sprite with a magenta background, then ask it to generate the final frame of the animation you want to create.Then use Google Flow to create an animation between the two frames with Veo3Its astoundingly effective, but still rather laborious and lacking in ergonomics. For example the video aspect ratio has to be fixed, and you need to manually fill the correct shade of magenta for transparency keying since the imagen model does not do this perfectly.IMO Veo3 is good enough to make sprites and animations for an 2000s 2D RTS game in seconds from a basic image sketch and description. It just needs a purpose built UI for gamedev workflows.If I was not super busy with family and work, I'd build a wrapper around these toolsreplyWaterluvian 13 hours ago

I think an important way to approach AI use is not to seek the end product directly. Don’t use it to do things that are procedurally trivial like cropping and colour palette changes, transparency, etc.For transparency I just ask for a bright green or blue background then use GIMP.For animations I get one frame I like and then ask for it to generate a walking cycle or whatnot. But usually I go for like… 3 frame cycles or 2 frame attacks and such. Because I’m not over reaching, hoping to make some salable end product. Just prototypes and toys, really.replylarrry 4 hours ago

I would imagine AI will be similar to factory automation.There will be millions of factories all benefiting from it, and a relatively small number of companies providing the automation components (conveyor belt systems, vision/handling systems, industrial robots, etc).The technology providers are not going to become fabulously rich though as long as there is competition. Early adopters will have to pay up, but it seems LLMs are shaping up to be a commodity where inference cost will be the most important differentiator, and future generations of AI are likely to be the same.Right now the big AI companies pumping billions into it to advance the bleeding edge necessarily have the most advanced products, but the open source and free-weight competition are continually nipping at their heels and it seems the current area where most progress is happening is agents and reasoning/research systems, not the LLMs themself, where it's more about engineering rather than who has the largest training cluster.We're still in the first innings of AI though - the LLM era, which I don't think is going to last for that long. New architectures and incremental learning algorithms for AGI will come next. It may take a few generations of advance to get to AGI, and the next generation (e.g. what DeepMind are planning in 5-10 year time frame) may still include a pre-trained LLM as a component, but it seems that it'll be whatever is built around the LLM, to take us to that next level of capability, that will become the focus.replyCM30 42 minutes ago

Practically speaking, it's going to be both more impactful than we think and less impactful than we think at the same time.On the one hand, there are a lot of fields that this form of AI can and will either replace or significantly reduce the number of jobs in. Entry level web development and software engineering is at serious risk, as is copywriting, design and art for corporate clients, research assistant roles and a lot of grunt work in various creative fields. If the output of your work is heavily represented in these models, or the quality of the output matters less than having something, ANYTHING to fill a gap on a page/in an app, then you're probably in trouble. If your work involves collating a bunch of existing resources, then you're probably in trouble.At the same time, it's not going to be anywhere near as powerful as certain companies think. AI can help software engineers in generating boilerplate code or setup things that others have done millions of times before, but the quality of its output for new tasks is questionable at best, especially when the language or framework isn't heavily represented in the model. And any attempts to replace things like lawyers, doctors or other such professions with AI alone are probably doomed to fail, at least for the moment. If getting things wrong is a dealbreaker that will result in severe legal consequences, AI will never be able to entirely replace humans in that field.Basically, AI is great for grunt work, and fields where the actual result doesn't need to be perfect (or even good). It's not a good option for anything with actual consequences for screwing up, or where the knowledge needed is specialist enough that the model won't contain it.replyunleaded 51 minutes ago

Something that's confused/annoyed me about the AI boom is that it's like we've learned to run before we learned to walk.

It also means that AI website generators are forced to generate assets with code when ordinary people would just use images/sound files (yes, I have really seen websites using webaudio synths for sound effects).Hopefully the boom will slow down and we'll all slowly move away from Holy Shit Hype things and implement more boring, practical things.

I think that AI is a benefit for about 1% of what people think it is good for.The remaining 99% had become a significant challenge to the greatest human achievement in distribution of knowledge.If people used LLMs, knowing that all output is statistical garbage made to seem plausible (i.e. "hallusinations"), and that it just sometimes overlaps with reality, it would be a lot less dangerous.There is not a single case of using LLMs that has lead to a news story, that isn't handily explained by conflating a BS-generator with Fact-machine.Does this sound like I'm saying LLMs are bad? Well, in every single case where you need factual information, it's not only bad, it's dangerous and likely irresponsible.But there are a lot of great uses when you don't need facts, or by simply knowing it isn't producing facts, makes it useful. In most of these cases, you know the facts yourself, and the LLM is making the draft, the mundane statistically inferable glue/structure. So, what are these cases?- Directing attention in chaos: Suggest where focus needs attention from a human expert. (useful in a lot of areas, medicine, software development).
- Media content: music, audio (fx, speech), 3d/2d art and assets and operations.
- Text processing: drafting, contextual transformation, etcDon't trust AI if the mushroom you picked is safe to eat.

> Yet some technological innovations, though societally transformative, generate little in the way of new wealth; instead, they reinforce the status quo. Fifteen years before the microprocessor, another revolutionary idea, shipping containerization, arrived at a less propitious time, when technological advancement was a Red Queen’s race, and inventors and investors were left no better off for non-stop running.This collapses an important distinction. The containerization pioneers weren’t made rich - that’s correct, Malcolm McLean, the shipping magnate who pioneered containerization didn’t die a billionaire. It did however generate enormous wealth through downstream effects by underpinning the rise of East Asian export economies, offshoring, and the retail models of Walmart, Amazon and the like. Most of us are much more likely to benefit from downstream structural shifts of AI rather than owning actual AI infrastructure.This matters because building the models, training infrastructure, and data centres is capital-intensive, brutally competitive, and may yield thin margins in the long run. The real fortunes are likely to flow to those who can reconfigure industries around the new cost curve.replydash2 10 hours ago

The problem is different though, the containers were able to be made by others and offered dependable success, and anything downstream of model creators is at the whim of the model creator... And so far it seems not much that one model can do that another can't, so this all doesn't bode well for a reliable footing to determine what value, if at all, can be added by anyone for very long.replydash2 9 hours ago

I think OP's thesis should be expanded.-AI is leading to cost optimizations for running existing companies, this will lead to less employment and potentially cheaper products. Less people employed temporary will change demand side economics, cheaper operating costs will reduce supply/cost side-The focus should not just be on LLM's (like in the article). I think LLMs have shown what artificial neural networks are capable of, from material discovery, biological simulation, protein discovery, video generation, image generation, etc. This isn't just creating a cheaper, more efficient way of shipping goods around the world, its creating new classifications of products like the microcontroller invention did.-The barrier to start businesses is less. A programmer not good at making art can use genAI to make a game. More temporary unemployment from existing companies reducing cost by automating existing work flows may mean that more people will start their own businesses. There will be more diverse products available but will demand be able to sustain the cost of living of these new founders? Human attention, time etc is limited and their may be less money around with less employment but the products themselves should cost cheaper.-I think people still underestimate what last year/s LLMs and AI models are capable of and what opportunities they open up, Open source models (even if not as good as the latest gen), hardware able to run these open source models becoming cheaper and more capable means many opportunities to tinker with models to create new products in new categories independent of being reliant on the latest gen model providers. Much like people tinkering with microcontrollers in the garage in the early days as the article mentioned.Based on the points above alone while certain industries (think phone call centers) will be in the red queen race scenario like the OP stated there will new industries unthought of open up creating new wealth for many people.replychongli 13 hours ago

I guess one flaw in the argument about success leading to failure due to model providers eating the product layer, esp for B2B, is it ignores switching costs. B2B integrations such as Glean or Abridge which work with an existing infrastructure setup are hard to throw away and there's little incentive to do so. So in that sense, I dont think AI providers will manage to eat this layer completely without bloating themselves to an unmanageable degree. As an analogy, while Google / Apple control the entire mobile ecosystem, they dont make the most valuable apps. Case in point, gaming apps such as Fortnite who have made billions in microtransactions while running on platforms controlled by other behemoths. They are good investments too.replylemonberry 6 hours ago

I can see AI helping some businesses do really well. I can also see it becoming akin to mass manufacturing. Take furniture for example, there's a lot of mass produced furniture of varying quality. But there are still people out there making furniture by hand. A lot of the hand built furniture is commanding higher prices due to the time and skill required. And people buy it!I think we'll see a ton of games produced by AI or aided heavily by AI but there will still be people "hand crafting" games: the story, the graphics, etc. A subset of these games will have mass appeal and do well. Others will have smaller groups of fans.It's been some time since I've read it, but these conversation remind me of Walter Benjamin's essay, "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction".replyRataNova 6 hours ago

I worked in weather for a while and the forecasters might as well have been betting on the horse races, the interpretation of the charts was very much the same psychology.The model did its thing but there was still an aspect of interpretation that was needed to convert data to a story for a few minutes on TV.For longer range forecasting the task was quite easy for the meteorologists, at least for the UK. Storm systems could be tracked from Africa across the Atlantic to North America and back across the Atlantic to the UK. Hence, with some well known phenomena such as that, my meteorologist friends would have a good general idea of what to expect with no model needed, just an understanding of the observations, obsessively followed, with all the enthusiasm of someone that bets on horses.My forecasting friends could tell me what to expect weeks out, however, the exact time the rain would fall or even what day would not be a certain bet, but they were rarely wrong about the overall picture.The atmosphere is far from a closed system, there only has to be one volcano fart somewhere on the planet to throw things out of whack and that is not something that is easy to predict. Predicting how the hard to predict volcano or solar flare affects the weather in a few weeks is beyond what I expect from AI.I am still waiting for e-commerce platforms to be replaced with Blockchain dapps, and I will add AGI weather forecasting to the queue of not going to happen.

That’s not what I said. But ok.Weather systems exhibit chaotic behavior which means that small changes to initial conditions have far reaching effects. This is why even the best weather models are only effective at most a few weeks out. It’s not because we don’t understand how weather works, it’s because the system fundamentally behaves in a way that requires keeping track of many more measurements than is physically possible. It’s precisely because we do understand this phenomenon that we can say with certainty that prediction at those time scales with that accuracy is not possible. There is not some magic formula waiting to be discovered. This isn’t to say that weather prediction can’t improve (e.g I don’t claim we have the best possible weather models now), but that predictions reach an asymptotic limit due to chaos.There are a handful of extremely simple and well understood systems (I would not call weather simple) that also exhibit this kind of behavior: a common example is some sets of initial conditions of a double-jointed pendulum. The physics are very well understood. Another perhaps more famous one is the three body problem. These two both show that even if you have the exact equations of motion, chaotic systems still cannot be perfectly modeled.replyawesome_dude 9 hours ago

But some does, and a lot of people are already getting enough informal and personal value that language models are clearly mainstreaming.)The biggest losers I see are successive waves of disruption to non-physical labor.As AI capabilities accrue relatively smoothly (perhaps), labor impact will be highly unpredictable as successive non-obvious thresholds are crossed.The clear winners are the arms dealers. The compute sellers and providers. High capex, incredible market growth.Nobody had to spend $10 or $100 billion to start making containers.replypalata 16 hours ago

AI made me this summary (I’ve grown quite weary of reading AI think pieces) and it seems like a really good comparison.>The article "AI Will Not Make You Rich" argues that generative AI is unlikely to create widespread wealth for investors and entrepreneurs. The author, Jerry Neumann, compares AI to past technological revolutions, suggesting it's more like shipping containerization than the microprocessor. He posits that while containerization was a transformative technology, its value was spread so thinly that few profited, with the primary beneficiaries being customers.>The article highlights that AI is already a well-known and scrutinized technology, unlike the early days of the personal computer, which began as an obscure hobbyist project. The author suggests that the real opportunities for profit will come from "fishing downstream" by investing in sectors that use AI to increase productivity, such as professional services, healthcare, and education, rather than investing in the AI infrastructure and model builders themselves.I used to be the biggest AI hater around, but I’m finding it actually useful these days and another tool in the toolbox.replyzkmon 9 hours ago

A few issues:1. The tech revolutions of the past were helped by the winds of global context. There were many factors that propelled those successful technologies on the trajectories. The article seems to ignore the contextual forces completely.2. There were many failed tech revolutions as well. Success rate was varied from very low to very high. Again the overall context (social, political, economic, global) decides the matters, not technology itself.3. In overall context, any success is a zero-sum game. You maybe just ignoring what you lost and highlighting your gains as success.4. A reverse trend might pickup, against technology, globalization, liberalism, energy consumption etcreplybossyTeacher 15 hours ago

Funny thing with people suddenly pretending we just got AI with LLMs. Arguably, AIs has been around for way longer, it just wasn't chatty. I think when people talking about AI, they are either talking about LLMs specifically or transformers. Both seem like a very reductive view of the AI field even if transformers are hottest thing around.replyOzzie_osman 9 hours ago

AI by nature is kind of like a black hole of value. Necessarily, a very small fraction will capture the vast majority of value. Luckily, you can just invest wisely to hedge some of the risk of missing out.replybgwalter 52 minutes ago

It is interesting that the early shipping containerization boom resulted in a bubble in 1975 and had a new low around 1990.1990 is when the real outsourcing mania started, which led to the destruction of most Western manufacturing. Apart from cheap Chinese trinkets the quality of life and real incomes have gotten worse in the West while the rich became richer.So this is an excellent analogy for "AI": Finding a new and malicious application can revive the mania after an initial bubble pop while making societies worse. If we allow it, which does not have to be the case.[As usual, under the assumption that "AI" works, of which there is little sign apart from summarizing scraped web pages.]replygraycat 6 hours ago

Apparently a lot of money is flowing into AI.Looking around, can find curious things current AI can't do but likely can find important things it can do.
Uh, there's "a lot of money", can't be sure
AI won't make big progress, and even on a national scale no one wants to fall behind. Looking around, it's scary about the growth -- Page and Brin in a garage, Bezos in a garage, Zuckerberg in school and "Hot or Not", Huang and graphics cards, ....
One or two guys, ... and in a few years change the world and $trillions in company value???
Smoking funny stuff?Yes, AI can be better than a library card catalog subject index and/or a dictionary/encyclopedia.
But a step or two forward and, remembering 100s of soldiers going "over the top" in WWI, asking why some AI robots won't be able to do the same?Within 10 years, what work can we be sure AI won't be able to do?So people will keep trying with ASML, TSMC, AMD, Intel, etc. -- for a yacht bigger than the one Bezos got or for national security, etc.While waiting for AI to do everything, starting now it can do SOME things and is improving.Hmm, a SciFi movie about Junior fooling around with electronics in the basement, first doing his little sister Mary's 4th grade homework, then in the 10th grade a published Web site book on the rise and fall of the Eastern Empire, Valedictorian, new frontiers in mRNA vaccines, ...?And what do people want?
How 'bout food, clothing, shelter, transportation, health, accomplishment, belonging, security, love, home, family?
So, with a capable robot (funded by a16z?), it builds two more like itself, each of those ..., and presto-bingo everyone gets what they want?"Robby, does P = NP?""Is Schrödinger's equation correct?""How and when can we travel faster than the speed of light?""Where is everybody?"replywhistle650 13 hours ago

Agreed, and I did mention medicines as examples of things that work but we don’t understand. But they weren’t “made” by us in quite the same way imo.replywsintra2022 13 hours ago

Except.. people do know exactly how these things work. They know because they are creating them. They know because they are improving them. What nonsense to say we do not know how these things work. Engineers building Qwen for example not only know how things work but they put all the work out there for people to reproduce (if they had the means) that work.replyvisarga 10 hours ago

We know in the same sense we understand the rules in Conway's game of life - at low level - but don't understand what those rules will produce at high level (gliders, guns) except by executing and seeing. Analogous to knowing what the code looks like and not knowing if it will halt.Knowing the low level rules, or the recursive transition rule of a system does not tell you its evolution in time.replywhistle650 13 hours ago
