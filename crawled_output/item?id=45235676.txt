The style of thinking in this piece is interesting but relies, understandably, on all the historical precedents and the rationalizations around them. But it’s different this time :). One way I think it actually is different is this: we don’t really understand how this thing, created by humans, really works. What other advancement has that property?
I can’t think of one. Perhaps certain important medicines?
Other new technologies: nuclear power, solar cells, etc., say, were fully engineered by a scientific understanding that was basically complete. Things like locomotives, or flight, or even the internet were fully understood in scientific and engineering terms.
They were extrapolations.
Forseeing how people would use it was, of course, difficult, and that is shared with AI.But it does seem a singular property of AI (this generation anyway) that even though “we” made it, we don’t understand it. That it works so well (e.g. next token prediction at scale) is unexpected even by the people who did it (at least that’s my relatively uninformed take … there’s a great book of scientific history to be written on that topic imo). In that sense AI is almost like an alien intelligence that landed here. It’s more of a discovery than an invention. Maybe superconductivity or quantum phenomena are analogues.In any case, what is the consequence of this for predicting how it will play out?replyFade_Dance 2 minutes ago

I think the interesting idea with “AI” is that it seems to significantly reduce barriers to entry in many domains.I haven’t seen a company convincingly demonstrate that this affects them at all. Lots of fluff but nothing compelling. But I have seen many examples by individuals, including myself.For years I’ve loved poking at video game dev for fun. The main problem has always been art assets.
I’m terrible at art and I have a budget of about $0. So I get asset packs off Itch.io and they generally drive the direction of my games because I get what I get (and I don’t get upset). But that’s changed dramatically this year. I’ll spend an hour working through graphics design and generation and then I’ll have what I need. I tweak as I go. So now I can have assets for whatever game I’m thinking of.Mind you this is barrier to entry. These are shovelware quality assets and I’m not running a business. But now I’m some guy on the internet who can fulfil a hobby of his and develop a skill. Who knows, maybe one day I’ll hit a goldmine idea and commit some real money to it and get a real artist to help!It reminds me of what GarageBand or iMovie and YouTube and such did for making music and videos so accessible to people who didn’t go to school for any of that, let alone owned complex equipment or expensive licenses to Adobe Thisandthat.replynostrademons 1 hour ago

I've noticed this as well.
It's a huge boon for startups, because it means that a lot of functions that you would previously need to hire specialists for (logo design! graphic design! programming! copywriting!) can now be brought in-house, where the founder just does a "good enough" job using AI.
And for those that can't (legal, for example, or various SaaS vendors) the AI usually has a good idea of what services you'd want to engage.Ironically though, having lots of people found startups is not good for startup founders, because it means more competition and a much harder time getting noticed.
So its unclear that prosumers and startup founders will be the eventual beneficiary here either.It would be ironic if AI actually ended up destroying economic activity because tasks that were frequently large-dollar-value transactions now become a consumer asking their $20/month AI to do it for them.replybossyTeacher 1 hour ago

All those customers, those AI boosted startups want to attract also have access to AI and so, rather than engage the services of those startups, they will find that AI does a good enough job. So those startups lost most of their customers, incoming layoffs :)replybenoau 2 hours ago

Yep this is a huge enabler - previously having someone "do art" could easily cost you thousands for a small game, a month even, and this heavily constrained what you could make and locked you into what you had planned and how much you had planned.
With AI if you want 2x or 5x or 10x as much art, audio etc it's an incremental cost if any, you can explore ideas, you can throw art out, pivot in new directions.replyKPGv2 2 minutes ago

I have a similar problem (available assets drive/limit game dev). What is your workflow like for generative game assets?replyWaterluvian 1 hour ago

It’s really nothing special. I don’t do this a lot.Generally I have an idea I’ve written down some time ago, usually from a bad pun like Escape Goat (CEO wants to blame it all on you. Get out of the office without getting caught! Also you’re a goat) or Holmes on Homes Deck Building Deck Building Game (where you build a deck of tools and lumber and play hazards to be the first to build a deck). Then I come up with a list of card ideas. I iterate with GPT to make the card images.
I prototype out the game. I put it all together and through that process figure out more cards and change things.
A style starts to emerge so I replace some with new ones of that style.I use GIMP to resize and crop and flip and whatnot.
I usually ask GPT how to do these tasks as photoshop like apps always escape me.The end result ends up online and I share them with friends for a laugh or two and usually move on.replycactusplant7374 2 hours ago

> Yet some technological innovations, though societally transformative, generate little in the way of new wealth; instead, they reinforce the status quo. Fifteen years before the microprocessor, another revolutionary idea, shipping containerization, arrived at a less propitious time, when technological advancement was a Red Queen’s race, and inventors and investors were left no better off for non-stop running.This collapses an important distinction. The containerization pioneers weren’t made rich - that’s correct, Malcolm McLean, the shipping magnate who pioneered containerization didn’t die a billionaire. It did however generate enormous wealth through downstream effects by underpinning the rise of East Asian export economies, offshoring, and the retail models of Walmart, Amazon and the like. Most of us are much more likely to benefit from downstream structural shifts of AI rather than owning actual AI infrastructure.This matters because building the models, training infrastructure, and data centres is capital-intensive, brutally competitive, and may yield thin margins in the long run. The real fortunes are likely to flow to those who can reconfigure industries around the new cost curve.replywewewedxfgdf 2 hours ago

You can't make such generalized statements about anything in computing/business.The AI revolution has only just got started. We've barely worked out basic uses for it. No-one has yet worked out revolutionary new things that are made possible only by AI - mostly we are just shoveling in our existing world view.replygiveita 2 hours ago

The point though is AI wont make you rich. It is about value capture. They compare it to shipping containers.I think AI value will mostly be spread. Open AI will be more like Godaddy than Apple. Trying to reduce prices and advertise (with a nice bit of dark patterns). It will make billions, but ultimately by competing its ass off rather than enjoying a moat.The real moats might be in mineral mining, fabrication of chips etc. This may lead to strained relations between countries.replykg 2 hours ago

The way I look at this question is: Is there somehow a glaring vulnerability/missed opportunity in modern capitalism that billions of people somehow haven't discovered yet? And if so, is AI going to discover it? And if so, is a random startup founder or 'little guy' going to be the one to discover and exploit it somehow? If so, why wouldn't OpenAI or Anthropic etc get there first given their resources and early access to leading technology?IIRC Sam Altman has explicitly said that their plan is to develop AGI and then ask it how to get rich. I can't really buy into the idea that his team is going to fail at this but a bunch of random smaller companies will manage to succeed somehow.And if modern AI turns into a cash cow for you, unless you're self-hosting your own models, the cloud provider running your AI can hike prices or cut off your access and knock your business over at the drop of a hat. If you're successful enough, it'll be a no-brainer to do it and then offer their own competitor.replyRetric 2 hours ago

>> Is there somehow a glaring vulnerability/missed opportunity in modern capitalism that billions of people somehow haven't discovered yet?Absolutely with 150% certainty yes, and probably many. The www started April 30, 1993, facebook started February 4, 2004 - more than ten years until someone really worked out how to use the web as a social connection machine - an idea now so obvious in hindsight that everyone probably assumes we always knew it. That idea was simply left lying around for anyone to pick up and implement rally fropm day one of the WWW. Innovation isn't obvious until it arrives. So yes absolutely the are many glaring opportunities in modern capitalism upon which great fortunes are yet to be made, and in many cases by little people, not big companies.>>

You're not wrong about "change" meaning "new potential wealth streams".
But not sure Facebook counts, 2004 vs 1993 shows an immense difference in network connectivity and computer ownership.
No way, hands down, Facebook would be what it is, if it started in 93.
It probably would have gone bankrupt, or been replaced by an upstart.replyawesome_dude 1 hour ago

There's a lot that goes into it. Before Facebook was Friendster. Which failed spectacularly because they tried to have some sort of n-squared graph of friends that took thw whole thing down. What FB got right in the early days was it didn't crash. We take that for granted now in the age of cloud everything.Also, there was Classmates.com. A way for people to connect with old friends from high school. But it was a subscription service and few people were desperate enough to pay.So it's wasn't just the idea waiting around but idea with the right combination of factors, user-growth on the Internet, etc.And don't forget Facebook's greatest innovation - requiring a .edu email to register. This happened at a time when people were hesitant to tie their real world personas with the scary Internet, and it was a huge advantage: a great marketing angle, a guarantee of 1-to-1 accounts to people, and a natural rate limiter of adoption.replywewewedxfgdf 2 hours ago

> IIRC Sam Altman has explicitly said that their plan is to develop AGI and then ask it how to get rich.There are still lots of currently known problems that could be solved with the help of AI that could make a lot of money - what is the weather going to be when I want to fly to <destination> in n weeks/months time, currently we can only say "the destination will be in <season> which is typically <wet/dry/hot/cold/etc>"What crops yield the best return next season? (This is a weather as well as a supply and demand problem)How can we best identify pathways for people whose lifestyles/behaviours are in a context that is causing them and/or society harm (I'm a firm believer that there's no such thing as good/bad, and the real trick to life is figuring out what context is where a certain behaviour belongs, and identifying which context a person is in at any given point in time - we know that psycopathic behaviour is rewarded in business contexts, but punished in social contexts, for example)replycatlifeonmars 1 hour ago

Few technologies have had as much adoption by so many individuals as quickly as AI models.(Not saying everything people are doing has economic value. But some does, and a lot of people are already getting enough informal and personal value that language models are clearly mainstreaming.)The biggest losers I see are successive waves of disruption to non-physical labor.As AI capabilities accrue relatively smoothly (perhaps), labor impact will be highly unpredictable as successive non-obvious thresholds are crossed.The clear winners are the arms dealers. The compute sellers and providers. High capex, incredible market growth.Nobody had to spend $10 or $100 billion to start making containers.replyxnx 2 hours ago
