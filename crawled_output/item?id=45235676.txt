I think the interesting idea with “AI” is that it seems to significantly reduce barriers to entry in many domains.I haven’t seen a company convincingly demonstrate that this affects them at all. Lots of fluff but nothing compelling. But I have seen many examples by individuals, including myself.For years I’ve loved poking at video game dev for fun. The main problem has always been art assets.
I’m terrible at art and I have a budget of about $0. So I get asset packs off Itch.io and they generally drive the direction of my games because I get what I get (and I don’t get upset). But that’s changed dramatically this year. I’ll spend an hour working through graphics design and generation and then I’ll have what I need. I tweak as I go. So now I can have assets for whatever game I’m thinking of.Mind you this is barrier to entry. These are shovelware quality assets and I’m not running a business. But now I’m some guy on the internet who can fulfil a hobby of his and develop a skill. Who knows, maybe one day I’ll hit a goldmine idea and commit some real money to it and get a real artist to help!It reminds me of what GarageBand or iMovie and YouTube and such did for making music and videos so accessible to people who didn’t go to school for any of that, let alone owned complex equipment or expensive licenses to Adobe Thisandthat.replynostrademons 4 hours ago

I've noticed this as well.
It's a huge boon for startups, because it means that a lot of functions that you would previously need to hire specialists for (logo design! graphic design! programming! copywriting!) can now be brought in-house, where the founder just does a "good enough" job using AI.
And for those that can't (legal, for example, or various SaaS vendors) the AI usually has a good idea of what services you'd want to engage.Ironically though, having lots of people found startups is not good for startup founders, because it means more competition and a much harder time getting noticed.
So its unclear that prosumers and startup founders will be the eventual beneficiary here either.It would be ironic if AI actually ended up destroying economic activity because tasks that were frequently large-dollar-value transactions now become a consumer asking their $20/month AI to do it for them.replybossyTeacher 4 hours ago

All those customers, those AI boosted startups want to attract also have access to AI and so, rather than engage the services of those startups, they will find that AI does a good enough job. So those startups lost most of their customers, incoming layoffs :)replybenoau 4 hours ago

Yep this is a huge enabler - previously having someone "do art" could easily cost you thousands for a small game, a month even, and this heavily constrained what you could make and locked you into what you had planned and how much you had planned.
With AI if you want 2x or 5x or 10x as much art, audio etc it's an incremental cost if any, you can explore ideas, you can throw art out, pivot in new directions.replyKPGv2 2 hours ago

It’s really nothing special. I don’t do this a lot.Generally I have an idea I’ve written down some time ago, usually from a bad pun like Escape Goat (CEO wants to blame it all on you. Get out of the office without getting caught! Also you’re a goat) or Holmes on Homes Deck Building Deck Building Game (where you build a deck of tools and lumber and play hazards to be the first to build a deck). Then I come up with a list of card ideas. I iterate with GPT to make the card images.
I prototype out the game. I put it all together and through that process figure out more cards and change things.
A style starts to emerge so I replace some with new ones of that style.I use GIMP to resize and crop and flip and whatnot.
I usually ask GPT how to do these tasks as photoshop like apps always escape me.The end result ends up online and I share them with friends for a laugh or two and usually move on.replyIAmGraydon 2 hours ago

I'm wondering a good way to create 2D sprite sheets with transparency via AI. That would be a game changer, but my research has led me to believe that there isn't a good tool for this yet. One sprite is kind of doable, but a sprite animation with continuity between frames seems like it would be very difficult. Have you figured out a way to do this?replyWaterluvian 2 hours ago
| root | parent | next [–]
I think an important way to approach AI use is not to seek the end product directly. Don’t use it to do things that are procedurally trivial like cropping and colour palette changes, transparency, etc.For transparency I just ask for a bright green or blue background then use GIMP.For animations I get one frame I like and then ask for it to generate a walking cycle or whatnot. But usually I go for like… 3 frame cycles or 2 frame attacks and such. Because I’m not over reaching, hoping to make some salable end product. Just prototypes and toys, really.replycactusplant7374 5 hours ago

> Yet some technological innovations, though societally transformative, generate little in the way of new wealth; instead, they reinforce the status quo. Fifteen years before the microprocessor, another revolutionary idea, shipping containerization, arrived at a less propitious time, when technological advancement was a Red Queen’s race, and inventors and investors were left no better off for non-stop running.This collapses an important distinction. The containerization pioneers weren’t made rich - that’s correct, Malcolm McLean, the shipping magnate who pioneered containerization didn’t die a billionaire. It did however generate enormous wealth through downstream effects by underpinning the rise of East Asian export economies, offshoring, and the retail models of Walmart, Amazon and the like. Most of us are much more likely to benefit from downstream structural shifts of AI rather than owning actual AI infrastructure.This matters because building the models, training infrastructure, and data centres is capital-intensive, brutally competitive, and may yield thin margins in the long run. The real fortunes are likely to flow to those who can reconfigure industries around the new cost curve.replywewewedxfgdf 5 hours ago

You can't make such generalized statements about anything in computing/business.The AI revolution has only just got started. We've barely worked out basic uses for it.

The point though is AI wont make you rich. It is about value capture. They compare it to shipping containers.I think AI value will mostly be spread. Open AI will be more like Godaddy than Apple. Trying to reduce prices and advertise (with a nice bit of dark patterns). It will make billions, but ultimately by competing its ass off rather than enjoying a moat.The real moats might be in mineral mining, fabrication of chips etc. This may lead to strained relations between countries.replyCuriouslyC 1 hour ago

That's 100% not the case. OpenAI is wedged between the unstoppable juggernaut that is Google at the high end and the state sponsored Chinese labs at the low end, they're going to mostly get squeezed out of the utility inference market.
They basically HAVE to pivot to consumer stuff and go head to head with Apple with AI first devices, that's the only way they're going to justify their valuation. This is actually not a crazy plan, as Apple has been resting on their laurels with their OS/software, and their AI strategy has been scattershot and bad.replyGigachad 1 hour ago

The value is going to be in deep integration with existing platforms.

The way I look at this question is: Is there somehow a glaring vulnerability/missed opportunity in modern capitalism that billions of people somehow haven't discovered yet? And if so, is AI going to discover it? And if so, is a random startup founder or 'little guy' going to be the one to discover and exploit it somehow? If so, why wouldn't OpenAI or Anthropic etc get there first given their resources and early access to leading technology?IIRC Sam Altman has explicitly said that their plan is to develop AGI and then ask it how to get rich. I can't really buy into the idea that his team is going to fail at this but a bunch of random smaller companies will manage to succeed somehow.And if modern AI turns into a cash cow for you, unless you're self-hosting your own models, the cloud provider running your AI can hike prices or cut off your access and knock your business over at the drop of a hat. If you're successful enough, it'll be a no-brainer to do it and then offer their own competitor.replyRetric 5 hours ago

>> Is there somehow a glaring vulnerability/missed opportunity in modern capitalism that billions of people somehow haven't discovered yet?Absolutely with 150% certainty yes, and probably many. The www started April 30, 1993, facebook started February 4, 2004 - more than ten years until someone really worked out how to use the web as a social connection machine - an idea now so obvious in hindsight that everyone probably assumes we always knew it. That idea was simply left lying around for anyone to pick up and implement rally fropm day one of the WWW. Innovation isn't obvious until it arrives.

You're not wrong about "change" meaning "new potential wealth streams".
But not sure Facebook counts, 2004 vs 1993 shows an immense difference in network connectivity and computer ownership.

There's a lot that goes into it. Before Facebook was Friendster. Which failed spectacularly because they tried to have some sort of n-squared graph of friends that took thw whole thing down. What FB got right in the early days was it didn't crash. We take that for granted now in the age of cloud everything.Also, there was Classmates.com. A way for people to connect with old friends from high school. But it was a subscription service and few people were desperate enough to pay.So it's wasn't just the idea waiting around but idea with the right combination of factors, user-growth on the Internet, etc.And don't forget Facebook's greatest innovation - requiring a .edu email to register. This happened at a time when people were hesitant to tie their real world personas with the scary Internet, and it was a huge advantage: a great marketing angle, a guarantee of 1-to-1 accounts to people, and a natural rate limiter of adoption.replywewewedxfgdf 5 hours ago

That’s not what I said. But ok.Weather systems exhibit chaotic behavior which means that small changes to initial conditions have far reaching effects. This is why even the best weather models are only effective at most a few weeks out. It’s not because we don’t understand how weather works, it’s because the system fundamentally behaves in a way that requires keeping track of many more measurements than is physically possible. It’s precisely because we do understand this phenomenon that we can say with certainty that prediction at those time scales with that accuracy is not possible.

I worked in weather for a while and the forecasters might as well have been betting on the horse races, the interpretation of the charts was very much the same psychology.The model did its thing but there was still an aspect of interpretation that was needed to convert data to a story for a few minutes on TV.For longer range forecasting the task was quite easy for the meteorologists, at least for the UK. Storm systems could be tracked from Africa across the Atlantic to North America and back across the Atlantic to the UK. Hence, with some well known phenomena such as that, my meteorologist friends would have a good general idea of what to expect with no model needed, just an understanding of the observations, obsessively followed, with all the enthusiasm of someone that bets on horses.My forecasting friends could tell me what to expect weeks out, however, the exact time the rain would fall or even what day would not be a certain bet, but they were rarely wrong about the overall picture.The atmosphere is far from a closed system, there only has to be one volcano fart somewhere on the planet to throw things out of whack and that is not something that is easy to predict. Predicting how the hard to predict volcano or solar flare affects the weather in a few weeks is beyond what I expect from AI.I am still waiting for e-commerce platforms to be replaced with Blockchain dapps, and I will add AGI weather forecasting to the queue of not going to happen. Imagine if it hallucinates.Will AI put bookmakers out of business? Nope. Same goes with weather.replyawesome_dude 54 minutes ago

I don't think most commenters have read the article. I can understand, it's rambly and a lot of it feels like they created a thesis first and then ham-fisted facts in later. But it's still worth the read for the last section which is a more nuanced take than the click-bait title suggests.replypizzly 2 hours ago
| prev | next [–]
I think OP's thesis should be expanded.-AI is leading to cost optimizations for running existing companies, this will lead to less employment and potentially cheaper products. Less people employed temporary will change demand side economics, cheaper operating costs will reduce supply/cost side-The focus should not just be on LLM's (like in the article). I think LLMs have shown what artificial neural networks are capable of, from material discovery, biological simulation, protein discovery, video generation, image generation, etc. This isn't just creating a cheaper, more efficient way of shipping goods around the world, its creating new classifications of products like the microcontroller invention did.-The barrier to start businesses is less. A programmer not good at making art can use genAI to make a game. More temporary unemployment from existing companies reducing cost by automating existing work flows may mean that more people will start their own businesses. There will be more diverse products available but will demand be able to sustain the cost of living of these new founders? Human attention, time etc is limited and their may be less money around with less employment but the products themselves should cost cheaper.-I think people still underestimate what last year/s LLMs and AI models are capable of and what opportunities they open up, Open source models (even if not as good as the latest gen), hardware able to run these open source models becoming cheaper and more capable means many opportunities to tinker with models to create new products in new categories independent of being reliant on the latest gen model providers. Much like people tinkering with microcontrollers in the garage in the early days as the article mentioned.Based on the points above alone while certain industries (think phone call centers) will be in the red queen race scenario like the OP stated there will new industries unthought of open up creating new wealth for many people.replychongli 2 hours ago

Few technologies have had as much adoption by so many individuals as quickly as AI models.(Not saying everything people are doing has economic value. But some does, and a lot of people are already getting enough informal and personal value that language models are clearly mainstreaming.)The biggest losers I see are successive waves of disruption to non-physical labor.As AI capabilities accrue relatively smoothly (perhaps), labor impact will be highly unpredictable as successive non-obvious thresholds are crossed.The clear winners are the arms dealers. The compute sellers and providers. High capex, incredible market growth.Nobody had to spend $10 or $100 billion to start making containers.replywsintra2022 2 hours ago

The style of thinking in this piece is interesting but relies, understandably, on all the historical precedents and the rationalizations around them. But it’s different this time :). One way I think it actually is different is this: we don’t really understand how this thing, created by humans, really works. What other advancement has that property?
I can’t think of one. Perhaps certain important medicines?
Other new technologies: nuclear power, solar cells, etc., say, were fully engineered by a scientific understanding that was basically complete. Things like locomotives, or flight, or even the internet were fully understood in scientific and engineering terms.
They were extrapolations.
Forseeing how people would use it was, of course, difficult, and that is shared with AI.But it does seem a singular property of AI (this generation anyway) that even though “we” made it, we don’t understand it. That it works so well (e.g. next token prediction at scale) is unexpected even by the people who did it (at least that’s my relatively uninformed take … there’s a great book of scientific history to be written on that topic imo). In that sense AI is almost like an alien intelligence that landed here. It’s more of a discovery than an invention. Maybe superconductivity or quantum phenomena are analogues.In any case, what is the consequence of this for predicting how it will play out?replyFade_Dance 2 hours ago
