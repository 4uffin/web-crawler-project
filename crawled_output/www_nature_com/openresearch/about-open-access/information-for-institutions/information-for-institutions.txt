Information for authors
Publishing your article open access (OA) can bring you several benefits, including increased downloads and citations—and make your research more accessible to readers globally.To help you take advantage of these benefits, many institutions cover researchers’ OA publishing costs (known as article processing charges, or APCs) as part of OA agreements with Springer Nature.

Financial support for APCs
Many institutions offer financial support for researchers to pay APCs. One way is through OA agreements with publishers—either on their own or through a consortium agreement across many institutions.Your institution’s OA agreement with Springer Nature may provide: Full APC coverage - 100% of the APC is paid by the institution A percentage discount - e.g. 10% off the list price APCFixed price coverage - e.g. up to €1,000 paid by the institution.
Different OA agreements include different journals
Institutions take different approaches to how they support their researchers publishing in different journals. Your institution’s agreement with Springer Nature may include journals from across Springer, Nature, BMC, Palgrave, and/or Adis.
Seamlessly integrated in the publishing workflow
Getting your APC paid via an OA agreement is seamlessly integrated into the Springer Nature publishing workflows and led by you, the corresponding author. Your article will be identified as part of an agreement based on details submitted. After your article has been accepted for publication, you will be notified of your coverage options and prompted to confirm your OA licensing on behalf of all co-authors. Explore the steps in detail.
