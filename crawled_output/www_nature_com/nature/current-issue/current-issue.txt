Self-help
Large language models (LLMs) tend to be better at solving problems if they can be trained to set out the steps they take as they try to reach the solution. This kind of ‘reasoning’ is similar to how humans approach more complex problems, but it presents significant challenges for artificial intelligence, requiring human intervention to add labels and annotations. In this week’s issue, researchers at DeepSeek reveal how they trained a model not only to reason in this way but also to do so with minimal human input. The model DeepSeek-R1 was trained using reinforcement learning in which the model was rewarded with a high score when it solved mathematical problems correctly and penalized when it got the answer wrong. As a result, it learnt that reasoning — tackling the problem in a stepwise manner and revealing those steps — was more likely to lead to the correct answer. This led DeepSeek-R1 to self-verify and self-reflect, checking its performance before giving answers to new questions and thereby improving its performance in coding and graduate-level science problems.
