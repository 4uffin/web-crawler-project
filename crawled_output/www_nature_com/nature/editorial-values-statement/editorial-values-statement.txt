Editorial Values Statement
Editors of the Nature Portfolio believe in the transformational power of science and its potential to drive positive change in the world.
As members of the scientific community, we are committed to supporting the research enterprise by curating, enhancing and disseminating research that is rigorous, reproducible and impactful. We work to promote openness and transparency as well as the highest standards in research culture.
We provide an independent forum for reporting and discussing issues concerning research and the community, and we engage with researchers at all stages of their career to understand their needs and advocate for positive change.
We believe that science should represent everyone. As such, we recognize that it is our responsibility to work towards overcoming inequities and to foster a culture of diversity and inclusion in our communities.
