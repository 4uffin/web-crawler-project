This section provides a description of all types of contribution published in Nature, and detailed instructions for preparing, formatting and writing all types of manuscripts published by Nature.
Presubmission enquiries
Presubmission enquiries are provided purely as a service to authors to see if a manuscript is likely to be of interest to the journal and are not compulsory.
