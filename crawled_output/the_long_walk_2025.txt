What to Know
Critics Consensus
Cooper Hoffman and David Johnsson's soulful performances bring a lot of heart to Stephen King's dystopian tale, making The Long Walk a life-or-death ordeal for its characters but a riveting ride for audiences.

...it’s not that [the film] doesn’t work (indeed, parts of it are rather good) but that it ultimately and fundamentally can’t, given what it actually is.
Rated: 2/5

Globe and Mail
While Lawrence keeps the momentum steady and ensures that every few minutes delivers some kind of violent jolt, there’s just not enough meat to this particular roadkill story to keep one cinematic foot in front of the other.

As brutal as this movie is, there is a lot of heart.

Killer Movie Reviews
A devastating gloss on war, actual and economic and political, of sending young men with their whole lives before them into a meat grinder where fairness and decency have no purchase. Where the ultimate battle is to keep your soul.
Rated: 5/5

Film is often about escapism… a way to step away from the heaviness of the real world. “The Long Walk” is a powerful, even incredible work of art, but it’s not escapism. It forces you to confront pain, control, and loss head-on.

Went in blind. Never read the book, so i can't speak on accuracy, but the movie was just OK. Reminded me of Hunger Games, but less memorable.

Most performances are great. The design choices too. But
where is the hope? What’s the point? What’s the takeaway? Is this what we want our kids to be inspired by? No, thank you
