Maresca is sporting skinny jeans and some Air Jordans today. A bold look for the Chelsea manager who might have been out shopping during the international break.

Nobody is happy here. Brentford's Michael Kayode thinks he's been fouled by Jamie Gittens, but the referee gives Chelsea the free-kick instead. But Trevoh Chalobah is shooting as the whistle goes so it's not clear why the ref then wouldn't play advantage. Chalobah did miss though.

Itâs good to rotate players and with an eye on the future games but itâs important to get that win wrapped up before thinking of the players who are yet to make their mark. Winning also keeps the momentum and morale high too. With all these changes Maresca has made, itâs a bit nervous for a Chelsea fan.DW

There was a bit of a question about who would play right back but Enzo Maresca has opted to Wesley Fofana in that role. Of course, he is naturally a centre-back, like the rest of the back line but he has played there before. Also, Trevoh Chalobah was the other candidate but he and Tosin Adarabioyo have performed well as a pair in Levi Colwill's absence through injury.

Tottenham manager Thomas Frank, speaking to Sky Sports: âIt
was a clear, deserved win. I think the first 20 minutes were more even. West
Ham had a few crosses flashed across the box, but after that we dominated
clearly.âIâm happy that we continued that in the second half. We
scored a great first goal and an even better second goal.âWeâre focusing on set pieces. Itâs an important area to be
good at. You need to be important in all areas and today we thought we had a
chance there.ââI felt we were brave and wanted to get on the ball. I
thought we were aggressive too. Thatâs the foundation to try and win a football
match.âOn Lucas Bergvall: âHe was really impressive. Iâm so
happy for him. His work rate, his energy, his enthusiasm â and then he scored a
fantastic goal.â

West Ham manager Graham Potter, speaking to BBC MOTD: "The first half was a positive performance for us. We connected well as a team and attacked well."We were incredibly committed and together as a team so it was disappointing the second half panned out the way it did. We had the red card after conceding and were quickly 2-0 down and it got away from us."We made a mistake for the first goal and they executed it well - we should do better. We had a good reaction, Jarrod [Bowen] had a shot but it became uncomfortable after the red card."On the sending off: "I don't think there was intent from Tomas [Soucek] and there wasn't a lot of speed in it but when you go with your studs raised you've got a problem."

Actually refreshing to see a team not just boot the kick-off into touch these days. Although Nathan Collins fouls Joao Pedro with about 10 seconds on the clock so the move comes to nothing.

West Ham manager Graham Potter, speaking to Sky Sports: "The scoreline is a difficult one for us. The second half went away quickly - I thought the first half was good. We showed attacking intent and there were positives. We made a mistake early in the second half and the game gets away from us after the red card."We've played two games at home against teams in the Champions League but the team is coming together and we need to be patient, focus on the positives and move forward."It was difficult for the players, we're at home, we've got our pride and don't want to make it worse. You're stuck between going after them and not getting opened up. I felt for the players."We defended about nine or 10 set-pieces before the goal but one mistake and we were punished. The red card makes it more difficult but the game at this level is about margins. We had a chance with Lucas [Paqueta] earlier and if that goes in then maybe it changes the game."If you look over the game it was relatively tight in terms of chances and shots but one slight mistake and they execute the set-piece well and then we're down to 10-men and it all changes."On reaction from fans: "I understand because the scoreline is the scoreline and I understand why people are upset. We are a new team and we have to stick together and focus on the things we've done well and see where we can improve."

Having won their last two, the Blues could win three successive league derbies for the first time since February 2024 (run of 4).After only losing two of their final 10 league games last season (W5 D3), Brentford have lost two of their first three in 2025-26 (W1). At home, though, the Bees have won three of their last four league games (L1).Chelsea have won as many as two of their first three Premier League games for only the second time in the last seven seasons (also two out of three in 2021-22).Brentford have lost three of their last five Premier League matches (W1 D1), as many as theyâd lost in their previous 14 combined (W8 D3 L3).Chelsea kept just four clean sheets in their first 26 Premier League games under Enzo Maresca but have since kept nine in their last 15, conceding only eight goals. Since the start of this clean sheet run (25 February), the Blues have the most clean sheets in the top-flight.Enzo FernÃ¡ndez has been involved in 14 goals in his last 18 appearances in all competitions for Chelsea (5 goals, 9 assists). Since the start of last season, the only Premier League player with more assists in all competitions than FernÃ¡ndez (18) is Mohamed Salah (24).Despite only playing 181 minutes in the Premier League this season, only one player has made more dribbles than Chelseaâs EstÃªvÃ£o (18). His nine against Fulham made him the youngest player on record (since 2006-07) with that many in a game for the Blues (18 years, 128 days) and youngest of any player since a 17-year-old Raheem Sterling for Liverpool vs Stoke in October 2012.Brentford forward Igor Thiago has applied 132 high intensity pressures in the opposition half this season so far, 27 more than any other player, and he also leads the way high intensity pressures in the final third of the pitch (88).HomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCBBC emails for youAdvertise with usCopyright Â© 2025 BBC.
