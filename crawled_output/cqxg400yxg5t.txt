Arsenal paid out approximately Â£250m on transfers this summer, taking their overall spending under Mikel Arteta to nearly Â£930m. When a handful of minor sales are accounted for, their net spend in the most recent window was Â£240m, the highest figure in the top flight, with Liverpool(Â£222m) the only other club to break the Â£200m mark. Those numbers will bring even more scrutiny and pressure on the Gunners, who have not won the league since 2004 and have gone five years since lifting the FA Cup, their only major trophyunder Arteta. Defeat at Anfield last time out was certainly not a terminal blow to their title ambitions but registering just a single shot on target highlighted a familiar failing. Arteta's side scored 69 Premier League goals last term, 22 fewer than in 2023-24, with the number of shots also fallingby 111.That drop off in attacking threat ultimately prevented them from running eventual champions Liverpool close. It is well documented how crucial set-pieces are to Arsenal, and four of the Gunners' six goals this term have come in that manner. But aside from restarts, the Londoners have struggled to break down opponents, with their expected goals figure from open play just 1.54, the second lowest in the league.Image source, BBC Sport

Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta, speaks to TNT Sports: "The amount of games we play in the next 21 days. It is finding that right balance by making sure everybody is connected."On Cristhian Mosquera starting over William Saliba: "He [William Saliba] trained yesterday, but at the end of the session he wasn't fully ready to start the game."On Eberechi Eze: "Very exciting there is different connections that the front three have not played together. They can change with different abilities and, in my opinion, that can be very powerful."On Ange Postecoglou: "I'm sure Ange will bring his own things. It is going to be different for sure."Image source, Reuters

Question: Has there ever been a bigger vibe shift in Premier League history than sacking Nuno Espirito Santo and appointing Ange Postecoglou?Answer: Time will tell.What we do know, though, is that the two have very contrasting styles of play. Forest were an outlier last season, excelling by sitting back, absorbing pressure and punishing teams on the counter-attack.That is not the Ange way, mate.

Mikel Arteta spoke yesterday about the reaction to when he brought Raya in to replace Aaron Ramsdale but the stats clearly show that move was justified.

Nottingham Forest boss Ange Postecoglou, speaking to TNT Sports: "Good to be back. What a couple of strikers here (Peter Crouch and Ally McCoist)!"Great to be back as it was unusual for me to be out of work. A long summer, but a great time with the family. "A great opportunity, it is no secret â in a good place with where the squad is at. Some great opportunities this year - back in Europe. It didn't take long for me to say 'yes' as I thought it is a great opportunity. "I didn't want to make so many changes today. I wanted to keep it fairly consistent. We lost Ola, but Morato comes in. "Until you get to know the players, it is hard to make an accurate assessment. Some guys have a hell lot of potential to improve as well. "When you walk in the dressing room and the feeling I sense is it's a united group. I'm looking forward to working with them. "I don't see anyone in the squad who won't be able to play the football that I want to play."I want to leave a mark and leave an impact. That's what we will try and do. A great experience [Spurs' Europa League win] last year and learnt a hell of a lot last year. "The squad that Nottingham have put together is well-equipped to handle that."

The players must be ready for Ange-ball immediately, there will be no half measures, no steady introduction. He knows the way he wants to play - whether it was criticised at Tottenham or not - and they will be asked to do that from day one.The counter-attacking game which served Forest so well under Nuno will remain to a point - Postecoglou will utilise it - pressing and possession will be quickly brought in.The clarity will be there and he will demand commitment but he is good at selling his vision, looking for players to follow him.He will invariably pick his team the day before a game but sometimes may not name it until matchday, although with 10 v 10 games in training - the likely starting line up against others - players will know the expected team.Post match he keeps many thoughts to himself, opting to reflect on the result and performance rather than any instant reactions, a ploy many managers use.Come Monday morning there will be a meeting to debrief the game with a video of around 10 minutes.It will review the structure, how players have reacted to losing the ball, penetration, attacking the box. This will be reinforced through the season.Early on it will most likely be spent discussing what he wants to see and how the squad have executed it.His first review will come after Saturday's game at the Emirates as the Postecoglou era begins.Image source, Getty Images

Postecoglou was named as Forest head coach on Tuesday, just 95 days after being sacked as Tottenham boss.The Australian didn't win a north London derby as Spurs boss but guiding Forest to their first victory on Arsenal turf since 1989 would be the perfect way to win over any sceptical supporters who doubt the wisdom of dismissing Nuno Espirito Santo.The Portuguese left the City Ground following a deteriorating relationship with owner Evangelos Marinakis and tension with Edu, the club's recently appointed global head of football. But Nuno's legacy mean he is unlikely to be out of work long - he took Forest into Europe for the first time in 30 years and leaves with the highest Premier League win percentage of any manager in the club's history.Image source, Getty Images
