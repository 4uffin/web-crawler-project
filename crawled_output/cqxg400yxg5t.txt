Chelsea are level through their star man. Enzo Fernandez's cross is headed down by Joao Pedro towards Cole Palmer, who sweeps home with a nice 12-yard half-volley.

Enzo Fernandez plays a nice reverse ball into Pedro Neto in the box. He squares it and there's nobody on the six-yard line to tap in.

I've lost count the amount of times Maresca has changed the team and tactics and that hasn't worked so has to try and fix it at half time with subs who should have been starting.Kev

Chelsea have been better since these subs probably. Tyrique George pulls the ball back for Marc Cucurella, whose shot is saved by the Brentford keeper.

That squad just shows that money does not buy you the best team. After spending whatever they have spent, I feel like there is a real lack of depth.George

Kevin Schade probably fouled Moises Caicedo while trying to get past him. Caicedo then shoves over Schade, who throws himself to the ground.The end decision is free-kick to Chelsea but no cards.

The Chelsea corner is poor and Brentford counter. And it's all kicking off now between Kevin Schade and Moises Caicedo - and their team-mates.

Could be such a great season. Brentford looked like relegation candidates in week 1, now theyâre leading against a Chelsea side who looked like they could contend for the top 2. And this is what makes the Prem so great, you donât ever get a week off no matter who youâre up against.LeeImage source, Getty Images

Having won their last two, the Blues could win three successive league derbies for the first time since February 2024 (run of 4).After only losing two of their final 10 league games last season (W5 D3), Brentford have lost two of their first three in 2025-26 (W1). At home, though, the Bees have won three of their last four league games (L1).Chelsea have won as many as two of their first three Premier League games for only the second time in the last seven seasons (also two out of three in 2021-22).Brentford have lost three of their last five Premier League matches (W1 D1), as many as theyâd lost in their previous 14 combined (W8 D3 L3).Chelsea kept just four clean sheets in their first 26 Premier League games under Enzo Maresca but have since kept nine in their last 15, conceding only eight goals. Since the start of this clean sheet run (25 February), the Blues have the most clean sheets in the top-flight.Enzo FernÃ¡ndez has been involved in 14 goals in his last 18 appearances in all competitions for Chelsea (5 goals, 9 assists). Since the start of last season, the only Premier League player with more assists in all competitions than FernÃ¡ndez (18) is Mohamed Salah (24).Despite only playing 181 minutes in the Premier League this season, only one player has made more dribbles than Chelseaâs EstÃªvÃ£o (18). His nine against Fulham made him the youngest player on record (since 2006-07) with that many in a game for the Blues (18 years, 128 days) and youngest of any player since a 17-year-old Raheem Sterling for Liverpool vs Stoke in October 2012.Brentford forward Igor Thiago has applied 132 high intensity pressures in the opposition half this season so far, 27 more than any other player, and he also leads the way high intensity pressures in the final third of the pitch (88).HomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCBBC emails for youAdvertise with usCopyright Â© 2025 BBC.
