It's mixed news on the injury front for Arsenal.Bukayo Saka missed the defeat at Anfield with a hamstring injury sustained during a 5-0 win against Leeds in mid-August.Mikel Arteta said on Friday that the winger remains in recovery and will not make today's matchday squad. But there's more hopeful news on centre-back William Saliba, who pulled up early on in the game against Liverpool and was forced off.The France defender trained on Friday and could be included in today's squad, but will Arteta take the risk?

The Gunners are unbeaten in 14 games on home soil against Forest (W10 D4) since a 3-1 defeat back in March 1989.Nottingham Forest have won just two out of 16 Premier League matches against Arsenal (D4 L10) and both wins came at the City Ground, in 1996-97 and 2022-23.Arsenalâs four-match winning Premier League run came to an end with their defeat to Liverpool on MD3 â the Gunners have not lost consecutive games in the competition since December 2023.Nottingham Forest have lost five of their last 11 Premier League matches (W3 D3), only one fewer than in their previous 24 games (W15 D3 L6).Among current Premier League sides, only Fulham (12) are on a longer run without a clean sheet than Nottingham Forest (11); away from home, Forest have gone nine without a shutout since keeping three in a row in December and January last season.Arsenal rank second, behind Chelsea, for expected goals from set plays (2.34) but they rank second bottom, ahead of only Sunderland, for expected goals in open play (1.54). 50.1% of their xG has been from set plays, the highest ratio in the division.Two of the three sides to make the most high intensity pressures in the final third this season are Nottingham Forest (301, 2nd) and Arsenal (280, 3rd), with strikers Viktor GyÃ¶keres (76, 2nd) and Chris Wood (72, 3rd) also in the top three among players for that metric.Nottingham Forest have made the most passes ending in the final third this season (471) and have played the most passes into the box (114) of any side.

The only two players to score two or more goals in both of their first two home Premier League appearances are David Hirst in August 1992 and Sergio AgÃ¼ero in August/September 2011.Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson has made the most line-breaking passes of any midfielder in the Premier League this season (32), while only Alex Iwobi (5) has made more line-breaking passes into the opposition penalty area than Anderson (4).HomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCBBC emails for youAdvertise with usCopyright Â© 2025 BBC.
