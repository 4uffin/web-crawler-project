Villa still havenât scored a league goal. This is getting really worrying. We have creative players, we have a proven goalscorer for the league, what is stopping this team!? Will it be like the metaphorical London bus, we score one & three come back to back?Dom, London

Sunderland are having their best spell of the game and Crystal Palace have not been able to get out of their half for the last five minutes or so.

Leeds keeper Karl Darlow makes his first Premier League save in almost four years, a good diving stop to keep out Harry Wilson's free-kick, which was bending towards the top corner.Leeds almost signed Wilson on deadline day.

The change in personnel has helped Villa. John McGinn has helped dominate the half, but the energy levels have not been the same from Everton.

Brighton are looking a lot livelier after a poor first half.Danny Welbeck comes close with an awkward-looking half-volley that fizzes wide past a scrambling Djordje Petrovic.

Lots of noise from the Aston Villa fans at the moment and they are playing well now as an important intervention just prevents Morgan Rogers turning in a cross.

Leeds right-back Jayden Bogle is allowed to run through unchallenged and his shot is saved.

Itâs the
perfect start isnât it, scoring on your debut at St Jamesâ Park.Iâve been interested to see the positions he takes up.
There was a lot of talk before the game than heâs more a number 10 than a nine.
But I'm sure Eddie Howe and his staff will be saying âyeah, heâs a good link-up
player but with his size, you have to get the ball to him in the boxâ.It was a very promising first half.

Big chance for Crystal Palace as Jean-Philippe Mateta stretches out a boot to prod a cross at goal but Robin Roefs saves well before the follow-up effort is blocked.

Leeds striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin flicks the ball in for Noah Okafor but he's tackled just as he's about to shoot.

He has been poor today, Morgan Rogers. He has shined for England on the international break, but he has struggled.

Bit strange to think 27% of Newcastle's line-up today are taller than 6ft 5in.

Another big chance for Beto!James Garner fires in a really inviting cross and all it needs is a touch, but Beto can't make the right one.

The second half is under way here. Can Newcastle see it out?

Jack Hinshelwood, who picked up an ankle injury less than a minute into this game, has emerged after half-time, hobbling out of the tunnel on a pair of crutches with his foot in a protective boot.

Back under way on the sunny south coast.I've just re-watched Alex Scott's goal and I think the assist might better than his stunning finish. Antoine Semenyo took the ball down beautifully and then tapped a cheeky nutmeg through Kaoru Mitoma's legs before teeing up Scott.Let's see what this second half holds in store.

Chance for Leeds to open the scoring as Brenden Aaronson is picked out at the near post but his effort is straight at Bernd Leno.
