Yet another corner for Tottenham. Mads Hermansen had to be alert to that one as it nearly swung directly in.

That would have been embarrassing. A mix up between Micky van de Ven and Guglielmo Vicario almost sees the ball ricochet off Christian Romero and into the Spurs goal.

You can see for West Ham, it's been an issue defending corners this season. All their players are trying to speak to each other but Tottenham are swinging it into the six-yard box and getting bodies in there.

Xavi Simons lifts in a lovely ball towards the back post but Mohammed Kudus can't quite get to it in time.

Another scramble in the box, with plenty more pushing and shoving as Spurs fizz in a corner.It looked like Micky van de Ven was rugby tackled to the floor by Mateus Fernandes.There was a VAR check, but they've decided play can continue.

Wrong decision to disallow that, but correct from VAR not to correct the referee there as there is a slight push. Hopefully VAR gets the praise when itâs deservedLewis

Djed Spence and Lucas Bergvall link up well on the left before the ball falls to Pedro Porro on the edge of the box. The Spaniard tries to play it back to the far post where Bergvall is waiting, but he's overhit it and Bergvall would have been in an offside position.

Premier League Match Centre on X: "The refereeâs call of no goal was checked and confirmed by VAR â with it deemed that van de Ven pushed Walker-Peters in the back and impacted his ability to play the ball."

How on earth is that not a goal for Spurs? The keeper actually pushes first it's just a coming together the ref has made a mistake there and VAR hasn't done its job.

Djed Spence does well on the left, stealing the ball off Kyle Walker-Peters before whipping a disappointing delivery straight to Mads Hermansen.

Mathys Tel looks to be in a bit of bother. The winger was limping around and he's now gone to ground.He's not happy, but is back up and running. He doesn't look too comfortable, though.

El Hadji Malick Diouf is having a great game so far. The Senegal international has whipped in a number of dangerous crosses and this one wins West Ham a corner.The hosts play it short before delivering the ball into the back post where Tomas Soucek meets it with a weak header, straight into the arms of Guglielmo Vicario.

It looked for all the world that Cristian Romero had acres of space. There's a coming together
but that doesn't look like there's much to it.

The decision stands. Christian Romero was judged to have pushed someone out of the way before nodding into the West Ham goal.I'd say a few Tottenham fans will be unhappy with that.Thomas Frank certainly isn't.

Spurs are looking a bit shaky at the back. There's another great cross from El Hadji Malick Diouf that just has a bit too much on it for Mateus Fernandes who was charging into the box.

scoresSkip back to previous meetingsSkip back to form guideSkip back to season so farMatch FactsScroll LeftScroll RightWest Ham have won just one of their last seven Premier League matches against Tottenham Hotspur (D3 L3), a 2-1 away win in December 2023.Each of the last three Premier League meetings between West Ham and Spurs at the London Stadium have ended as 1-1 draws â Spurs are winless in five league visits (D3 L2) since a 3-2 win in November 2019.West Ham lost their first two Premier League games of 2025-26 but beat Nottingham Forest 3-0 on MD3 â theyâve only won consecutive matches once since David Moyes departed the club, doing so in February 2025.Spurs have lost 10 of their last 16 London derbies in the Premier League (W3 D3), keeping just one clean sheet in their last 21 derby matches in the league, a 2-0 away win at Thomas Frankâs Brentford in February 2025.Having averaged 3.4 shots on target per game across their first 20 Premier League matches under Graham Potter, West Ham had eight in their 3-0 win over Nottingham Forest, their most in a league game under him.Tottenham Hotspur have lost 17 of their last 23 Premier League matches that havenât been against newly promoted sides (W3 D3), with two of their last four league wins against non-promoted sides coming away at the Etihad against Manchester City in November 2024 and August 2025.In his first Premier League appearance since January, Crysencio Summerville came on as an 82nd minute substitute and assisted a goal and won a penalty for West Ham in their 3-0 win over Nottingham Forest â he was the first player in Premier League history to be subbed on that late in a game and achieve that.Following a 2-0 win away at Man City, Thomas Frank is looking to become just the third Spurs manager to win his first two away top-flight matches in charge of the club, along with Ossie Ardiles in 1993-94 and Tim Sherwood in 2013-14.Jarrod Bowen has had a hand in nine Premier League goals in his last nine appearances (6 goals, 3 assists). Since his first appearance under Graham Potter in early February, only Mohamed Salah (15) has scored and assisted more goals than Bowen (9 goals, 4 assists) in the Premier League.Tottenham Hotspur defender Pedro Porro has played 86 Premier League games but never been involved in a 0-0 draw, an all-time record without featuring in one. Itâs the second-longest start to a Premier League career without a 0-0, with only MikaÃ«l Silvestre going more games from his debut without a goalless one (134 matches before featuring in Man Utd 0-0 Arsenal in September 2003).HomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCBBC emails for youAdvertise with usCopyright Â© 2025 BBC.
