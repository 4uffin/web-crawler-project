Was Martin Zubimendi signed to score goals? Well, he has popped up with two today. Forest defensively switched off.

My colleague reliably informs me that it's the first time Martin Zubimendi has scored twice in a game during his career.And I for one believe him.

Noni Madueke blows a kiss to the crowd as he makes his way off the field.He's been Arsenal's best player this afternoon, and by some distance.

Noni Madueke is outstanding. I watched the game against Serbia and he was equally outstanding in that. He constantly drives at his full-back. At the start of the season, some Arsenal fans were complaining about him signing.

Deary me, Nottingham Forest will be thankful to see the back of Noni Madueke.The England winger leaves the Forest defence with twisted blood, going left and right before playing a gorgeous reverse ball for the overlapping Jurrien Timber.The full-back zips an enticing ball across the box, that Declan Rice comes agonisingly close to making.What a move.

This has been more about Arsenal than it has been about Forest. Eberechi Eze has been amazing and he has given them something different. Noni Madueke, you can see his confidence is high.

A lot of Arsenal fans were doubting the transfer and Noni Madueke looks in electric form. He can go either way. He will go on his right as much as he cuts in on his left. From a defensive point of view, that's difficult to defend against.He has caused all sorts of problems.

I was worried Arsenal were becoming Man United. Too many 'superstars' spoiling the broth. But the Gunners seem to have got the mix right.
