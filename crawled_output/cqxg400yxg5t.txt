Aston Villa know all too well the threat of Jack Grealish and they have two players on him whenever he has the ball.

Newcastle should be ahead. Joelinton nods down a long throw and Jacob Murphy, four yards out, shoots straight at Sam Johnstone.

Beto had to score that earlier chance. No wonder he was holding his head in his hands. Iliman Ndiaye stuck that on a plate for him and it was a horrible miss.Good early pressure from Everton.

Fully expecting Everton to pose a serious threat to an out of form Aston Villa, Grealish already bagging four assists in two matches.Kieran, Southampton

A very good start from Everton. The noise around the stadium has picked the Everton players up. The difference in Everton is they're athletic upfront and that's what they have added.

Daichi Kamada goes down inside the box as he turns away from Omar Alderete. Palace fans appeal for a penalty but nothing given.

This is the first time in over a year that James Milner has started a Premier League game. He's on 641 appearances now. Only 12 more to equal Gareth Barry's record.The 39-year-old has just put far too much on a pass and it flies up over the Bournemouth defence and out.

Beto is getting frustrated as he doesn't control a long ball by James Tarkowski very well and the ball bounces off him and out of play.Still, he is getting in some good positions so far.

Nice Toon move but Joelinton's cutback is cut out.
6021Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingPostpublished at 15:09 BST15:09 BSTEverton 0-0 Aston Villa
Jack Grealish scoops the ball over to the back post for Beto, whose header is superbly denied by Emi Martinez, but the flag is up for offside for Grealish.Strong start by Everton, however.

Newcastle United are just catching their breaths after Wolves signalled their intent with that breakneck start.The away end have even felt assured enough to taunt: "Where's your famous atmosphere?"

Villa should be 1-0 down - it was a brilliant chance for Beto. It was a simple tap-in.

Sunderland have a set-piece opportunity with a free-kick. Grant Xhaka whips the ball in but can't beat the first Crystal Palace defender.
