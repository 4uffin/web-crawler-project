I think given the fact Brighton won against Man City last week, you think as a footballing naivety you have a good performance one week and you think you can carry it into the next. Unfortunately, it wasn't going to be for them today. I think it was a good game. Fabian Hurzeler is right to be disappointed because he expected more from his team and he feels a decision didn't go his way.

Everton defender Michael Keane, speaking to BBC MOTD: "I thought we were really good and got on the front foot, and we made it tough for Villa. On another day, it is a game we win. It didn't quite happen for us. The performance was really good and one to be happy with."On his headers: "The first one is not an easy one and the second one is a great save from the keeper. On another day I am sure I could have scored one or two. "They have some really good players â the way we defended as a whole team was really good. We pressed them really well - I'm sure they will go home thinking they had a really tough afternoon."On Jack Grealish and Iliman Ndiaye: "We have got to get the ball to them as much as we can. They're our dangermen. We are lucky to have them, and we need them to keep playing the way they are."

Newcastle debutant Nick Woltemade told BBC Sport: "It felt amazing. If you win the game it's more important too."The Premier league was quite hard. I had cramps. The atmosphere, the team played really good balls and involved me a lot. I think we did quite good. It was a hard game and it was important we won a game."I was here for four days so everything was new for me. I was focusing on myself today. The coach has given me such a good feeling. I felt good on the pitch and knew what I was doing."

Fulham manager Marco Silva, speaking to BBC Match of the Day: "Definitely a tight game, very difficult in some moments to break them down."You felt straightaway the changes that Daniel made to his team were to be much more conservative out wide, control better our left-hand side - and they did it."With good organisation it is not easy to break them down. In the first half, we were probably too slow, We did not take too many risks and we were too slow, then it is difficult to break them down. They had one good shot from a second ball."I think second half we were much better, more dynamic. In these moments, you can have a bit of fatigue and in the last 30 minutes we did create some dangerous moments around their box. Great header from Rodrigo, we should have scored."An own goal in the last minute of the game so we have to feel a bit fortunate. A nice feeling for us, a difficult feeling for Daniel and the Leeds boys but that is part of the game."It was important for us to keep a clean sheet because we need to create this habit and it allowed us to go on and try to win the game."On Kevin's debut from the bench: "Massive impact from him. I know him very well. When I pushed the board to go for him, he's a player I know. Still very young but already enough maturity. He was playing in
different league, not a top five league, but in Champions League and you could see in moments the quality of the player."He's an exciting player and he has a profile that we don't have in our side. It's good to have competition and have players that can break down opposition teams."It is not about the speed, it's about the circumstances when you sign players on the last day of the market. If a player has a pre-season he has time to settle and understand what we want, if they arrive last day of the window it is going to take more time."He's a great talent and he's going to help us."

Brighton head coach Fabian Hurzeler speaking to Sky Sports: "The performance was quite good, we dominated the game, we had chances, we just made the wrong decisions. The small margins made the difference and we weren't at highest level."On injuries at start of the game: "Not a brilliant start but we responded in a good way, kept on pushing. We faced a lot of adversity today."On the shove to Maxim De Cuyper by Antoine Semenyo: "It shouldn't be like this and then we concede a goal with 10 men so I think it's not the right thing. Very unlucky but we have to accept it, that's football."On conceding a penalty: "We win together, we lose together. We will analyse it and come back."On whether Jack Hinshelwood's injury is serious: "I think it is. I'm not a doctor so we have to wait for the scan."

Everton defender Michel Keane, speaking to Sky Sports about his two headed attempts: "I think the first one I got a good head on it, but it was a good save. "The second one I was holding my run hoping Jack [Grealish] would pull it back, which he did. On another day I would have scored - marginally it was not meant to be today. "I thought we played well today. I thought we were a threat going forward. Sometimes it happens. I thought we had enough chances to win the game.""We need to try to make this a fortress as quickly as possible. The club is definitely going in the right place."

Brighton head coach Fabian Hurzeler speaking to BBC MOTD: "I think we don't have to lose this game. We controlled the game quite well, we had chances, the first goal was unlucky when we had 10 men on the pitch. The second goal was an easy mistake. It feels disappointing but we have to show a reaction."On Jack Hinshelwood and Maxim De Cuyper's injuries: "I didnt see them yet so I have to watch it back., Hopefully not the worst but it's an adversity that we have to face. The team reacted in a good way."On Antoine Semenyo's shove on Maxim De Cuyper: "I heard the thoughts but sometime it's better to say nothing."You don't want to get in trouble? "No."On Brighton's away form: "We can't be happy but we have to keep on going, focus on our performances and then results will come."

Wolves needed to get a result because that's four games in a row that they've lost, I think for the first time in their history to start the season. I think Wolves started off really well but you could see as the game progressed their Achilles heel this season is creating good opportunities, taking chances, scoring goals.

Unbelievable. They have settled in so well and we are playing like we know we can."Brighton as always are a tough team, very direct and like to play football which suits us with our press. They've got so many top players but I though we did very well today."On his goal: "I don't score enough goals and it's something I need to bring into my game as a number eight. That takes you to the next level. Some of the lads were saying I was going to score so I'm happy to score. A long time coming."On Antoine Semenyo: "He's deadly from anywhere.

They had chances and Emi Martinez made top saves. A point in the right direction and we go from there. "I felt like we lacked that final pass and the final shot. I know the boys up top are frustrated that we have not scored a goal, so we will go back, and they will be working hard to make sure they score the next game."On Beto: "I thought he was alright. He was alright... it is what it is. "He was a handful at times, but for me, he was alright."On the mood in camp: "The mood in the changing room is fine. In tough moments we need to stick together and that's what we're doing now."

Newcastle took the lead and did whatever they needed to do. From my perspective it wasn't a vintage Newcastle performance but it's a win and their next game's in the Champions League, so you could say the energy is very much up for them at this moment in time.

Nick Woltemade did enough in 65 minutes against Wolves to give
Newcastle fans hope they have found a suitable successor to Alexander Isak.The 23-year-old demonstrated his tidy link-up play,
completing 89% of his passes, and used his 6ft 6in frame to good effect,
winning three of his four aerial duels.
The German only had 20 touches, fewer than any other Magpies
starter, but his touch map shows he made his presence count where it matters most. He had five
touches in the opposition box, including his 29th minute goal.

Since his first appearance under Graham Potter in early February, only Mohamed Salah (15) has scored and assisted more goals than Bowen (9 goals, 4 assists) in the Premier League.Tottenham Hotspur defender Pedro Porro has played 86 Premier League games but never been involved in a 0-0 draw, an all-time record without featuring in one. Itâs the second-longest start to a Premier League career without a 0-0, with only MikaÃ«l Silvestre going more games from his debut without a goalless one (134 matches before featuring in Man Utd 0-0 Arsenal in September 2003).HomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCBBC emails for youAdvertise with usCopyright Â© 2025 BBC.
