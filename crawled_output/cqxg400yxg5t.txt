Madueke had Morato on toast. He's been unplayable. He's a man full of confidence.

Noni Madueke and Eberechi Eze have made a mockery of the defence. All we need is threading the ball to Viktor Gyokeres to make it an easy win, but Nottingham Forest's defence have a tight grip on him.Jonathon, Essex

Great goal by Arsenal, but this game is like watching paint dry.Charles, PerthBy Christmas there will have been a further managerial change. Iâm fairly sure of that Forest will be in the bottom third of the table for certain this season.Jon, Nottingham

I think Ange will be fairly pleased overall. Forest have not been able to do much with the ball, but I think we have seen Forest show a lot more in control when they do have the ball. One player, in particular, who will enjoy playing under Ange is Elliot Anderson.

Well, what did you make of the opening 45 minutes?Arsenal certainly made a bright start, particularly winger Noni Madueke who had Forest full-back Morato on toast at times. Martin Zubimendi opened his account for the club with a well-struck volley from the edge of the box, though it took a slight deflection to beat Forest 'keeper Sels.Forest struggled for much of the first half but their best moments came after going behind, with Morgan Gibbs-White and Chris Wood coming into the game more.

Arsenal are still not moving the ball quickly enough when they're in the opposition half, but at least possession is good.Chris

It's been a quiet afternoon so far for Viktor Gyokeres but the Swede burst into life there to get on the end of a cross from Eberechi Eze.The striker can't get enough on his effort and stabs it wide.

Forest put together their best move of the game so far as Morgan Gibbs-White plays a one-two with Chris Wood, only to curl his effort wide.Much, much better from the visitors. That move started after some lovely play from Elliot Anderson, by the way.

Forest are seeing more of the ball now that Arsenal have taken the lead.The Gunners are seemingly happy to drop a bit deeper, allowing Forest on to them in the hope of exploiting spaces on the break.

That lasted long. 37 minutes and Ange has his first injury!David, YorkEveryone waiting for Ange to fail is a massive disrespect. He's got a good squad at Forest in terms of skill and mentality. He'll do really well, and the naysayers will disappear.Matt, Nottingham

Murillo has been in the thick of the action. He has been superb and he has been asked to do a lot of defending which he has done really well. It would be a huge blow if he can't continue.

Oh my goodness, what a hit! The Spaniard gets his first goal for the club by meeting a clearance from a corner on the volley.At first it looks like the midfielder's effort flies into the top corner, but replays show it takes a slight deflection on the way in which took it past Sels in the Forest net.Nonetheless, a sensational hit.

The Gunners are unbeaten in 14 games on home soil against Forest (W10 D4) since a 3-1 defeat back in March 1989.Nottingham Forest have won just two out of 16 Premier League matches against Arsenal (D4 L10) and both wins came at the City Ground, in 1996-97 and 2022-23.Arsenalâs four-match winning Premier League run came to an end with their defeat to Liverpool on MD3 â the Gunners have not lost consecutive games in the competition since December 2023.Nottingham Forest have lost five of their last 11 Premier League matches (W3 D3), only one fewer than in their previous 24 games (W15 D3 L6).Among current Premier League sides, only Fulham (12) are on a longer run without a clean sheet than Nottingham Forest (11); away from home, Forest have gone nine without a shutout since keeping three in a row in December and January last season.Arsenal rank second, behind Chelsea, for expected goals from set plays (2.34) but they rank second bottom, ahead of only Sunderland, for expected goals in open play (1.54). 50.1% of their xG has been from set plays, the highest ratio in the division.Two of the three sides to make the most high intensity pressures in the final third this season are Nottingham Forest (301, 2nd) and Arsenal (280, 3rd), with strikers Viktor GyÃ¶keres (76, 2nd) and Chris Wood (72, 3rd) also in the top three among players for that metric.Nottingham Forest have made the most passes ending in the final third this season (471) and have played the most passes into the box (114) of any side.

The only two players to score two or more goals in both of their first two home Premier League appearances are David Hirst in August 1992 and Sergio AgÃ¼ero in August/September 2011.Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson has made the most line-breaking passes of any midfielder in the Premier League this season (32), while only Alex Iwobi (5) has made more line-breaking passes into the opposition penalty area than Anderson (4).HomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCBBC emails for youAdvertise with usCopyright Â© 2025 BBC.
