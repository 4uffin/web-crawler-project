Just discovered it's Brentford boss Keith Andrews' 45th birthday today. Suspect Fabio Carvalho's goal is better than anything he might have got at home this morning.

Brentford goalscorer Fabio Carvalho, speaking to BBC Match of the Day: "Unbelievable. Everyone likes a last-minute goal. I'm just grateful I got it today."I have done it before. I just try to make an impact every time I step on the pitch. That's what the gaffer wanted me to do. God willing, it paid off today."On Brentford's use of long throws: "I feel like we use it a lot and it pays off. We've not just scored today but previous years as well. It's something we work on and today it paid off."On how the season has gone so far: "We played some tough teams, had some challenges ourselves within the club but I feel like everyone has handled it amazingly. Hopefully we can kick on and get more results."

Brentford goalscorer Fabio Carvalho, speaking to Sky Sports: "We stuck to the gameplan and it shows our resilience and what the club is about. It wasn't a win but it feels like a win and it's important to get these points."We know what Chelsea's strengths are, they have quality players but we know our strengths and used our attributes today."On scoring the equaliser from a set-piece: "Brentford are big on set-pieces and it's good to put that into practice. It's not as easy as it looks [to find space] but hopefully I can do that again. We do a lot of analysis off the pitch with video and utilise it."On playing under Keith Andrews: "Keith is making his mark with the staff as well and the team are on board. We've got enough quality to do well this season."I'm sure we will be OK - we've lost players but have added a lot of quality and as long as we stay together we'll be fine. Once we get momentum we'll be good."

I can only think of Bournemouth who have been decimated more by the loss of important players leaving. With Brentford, you have lost goals, leaders in the team, your captain. Now this is an opportunity for the new breed. Schade is going to be a really good player. Defensively Collins is a going to be a leader of men, he is so important to that team. And Fabio Carvalho, I saw him in the summer in Portugal and he was doing a pre pre-season and he was working hard and doing extra because things have not gone his way since he left Fulham. He won't want to be a sub but it shows the importance of the squad. It is a massive point for them.

I thought Brentford were magnificent. It would have been a travesty had they not got something out of the game. They never gave up. I thought Jordan Henderson in midfield... it was a masterclass. The energy and organisation he showed, he was absolutely brilliant.For Brentford to sign him is a masterstroke.

Moises Caicedo has scored in both of his Premier League away games in 2025-26 (v West Ham and Brentford). Prior to this season, he had only netted one goal in his first 60 away matches in the competition (v Manchester United in November 2024).

Thatâs why we wonât win the league - Sanchez. He never comes out for corners or free-kicks and then stares at his defenders after conceding. Poor leadership.SamHow did we have five players in one spot and one man marking three at the back? C'mon Chelsea. Do better.Ryan in Winchester

Moises Caicedo thought he had won the game with a brilliant shot from outside the box with five minutes to go but Fabio Carvalho equalised from close range in injury time.

Having won their last two, the Blues could win three successive league derbies for the first time since February 2024 (run of 4).After only losing two of their final 10 league games last season (W5 D3), Brentford have lost two of their first three in 2025-26 (W1). At home, though, the Bees have won three of their last four league games (L1).Chelsea have won as many as two of their first three Premier League games for only the second time in the last seven seasons (also two out of three in 2021-22).Brentford have lost three of their last five Premier League matches (W1 D1), as many as theyâd lost in their previous 14 combined (W8 D3 L3).Chelsea kept just four clean sheets in their first 26 Premier League games under Enzo Maresca but have since kept nine in their last 15, conceding only eight goals. Since the start of this clean sheet run (25 February), the Blues have the most clean sheets in the top-flight.Enzo FernÃ¡ndez has been involved in 14 goals in his last 18 appearances in all competitions for Chelsea (5 goals, 9 assists). Since the start of last season, the only Premier League player with more assists in all competitions than FernÃ¡ndez (18) is Mohamed Salah (24).Despite only playing 181 minutes in the Premier League this season, only one player has made more dribbles than Chelseaâs EstÃªvÃ£o (18). His nine against Fulham made him the youngest player on record (since 2006-07) with that many in a game for the Blues (18 years, 128 days) and youngest of any player since a 17-year-old Raheem Sterling for Liverpool vs Stoke in October 2012.Brentford forward Igor Thiago has applied 132 high intensity pressures in the opposition half this season so far, 27 more than any other player, and he also leads the way high intensity pressures in the final third of the pitch (88).HomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCBBC emails for youAdvertise with usCopyright Â© 2025 BBC.
