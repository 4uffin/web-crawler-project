That was Mohammed Kudus' chance. That would have been the icing on the cake from Tottenham's point of view.

Mohammed Kudus tries again, but it's blocked again.Tottenham have their first corner in a while. Another goal incoming?

The biggest sigh of the afternoon has come up because the fourth official has put five minutes up. Everybody has just gone, 'Why?'. This is a nothing game - it is finished.

How have Tottenham not scored a fourth?Mohammed Kudus can't beat Mads Hermansen from close range and Brennan Johnson skies the rebound, although it turns out the Welshman would have been offside had it gone in.

There will be five minutes added on.I'd say both teams think that's five too many.

Spurs don't look too worried about grabbing a fourth goal here. They're in complete cruise control as they pass the ball sideways.The fans do care, though. "We want four," are the shouts from the away end.

That's the last thing West Ham need. Jarrod Bowen appears to be in a fair bit of pain as he goes down after a challenge from Djed Spence.He seems to be alright.

In a dreadful league campaign last season, Bergvall was one of the few bright sparks. Always gave 100% and full of running and endeavour. Good to see him shining today. He is a class young player.Tattz in Thurlestone

I know they're 3-0 down and only have 10 men on the pitch, but there's absolutely no fight left in this West Ham side.Not the sort of thing you want to be seeing as a fan of the Hammers.

Graham Potter has got problems. I was surprised when they signed Mads Hermansen. He was susceptible last season and watching him today he has not left his line once. You need help from the goalkeeper and that has not come from Hermansen.

Now lets see what Spurs do with this momentum in the game. These are the games that the big boys end up rounding out 0-5 or more but Spurs are rarely that ruthless...and just sit back...Vincent

11 goals (and counting) conceded in 4 games is relegation waiting to happen. For all the owners need to leave for West Ham to be a success, the inability to defend so far this season has to sit with Graham Potter.Matt

This is a horrible place to be as a team that are 3-0 down and down to 10-men. You just want to get off the pitch. I have been in this position a number of times and it is very difficult.

Spurs are enjoying themselves. The players are pinging it around the pitch like it's some sort of training game.The West Ham players are almost at a standstill. It looks like they've given up.

The team selection, the substitutions, the attitude by this team is a disgrace. West Ham are stinking the place out. A complete lack of pride. Total embarrassment. Potter is toast!Andy

have won just one of their last seven Premier League matches against Tottenham Hotspur (D3 L3), a 2-1 away win in December 2023.Each of the last three Premier League meetings between West Ham and Spurs at the London Stadium have ended as 1-1 draws â Spurs are winless in five league visits (D3 L2) since a 3-2 win in November 2019.West Ham lost their first two Premier League games of 2025-26 but beat Nottingham Forest 3-0 on MD3 â theyâve only won consecutive matches once since David Moyes departed the club, doing so in February 2025.Spurs have lost 10 of their last 16 London derbies in the Premier League (W3 D3), keeping just one clean sheet in their last 21 derby matches in the league, a 2-0 away win at Thomas Frankâs Brentford in February 2025.Having averaged 3.4 shots on target per game across their first 20 Premier League matches under Graham Potter, West Ham had eight in their 3-0 win over Nottingham Forest, their most in a league game under him.Tottenham Hotspur have lost 17 of their last 23 Premier League matches that havenât been against newly promoted sides (W3 D3), with two of their last four league wins against non-promoted sides coming away at the Etihad against Manchester City in November 2024 and August 2025.In his first Premier League appearance since January, Crysencio Summerville came on as an 82nd minute substitute and assisted a goal and won a penalty for West Ham in their 3-0 win over Nottingham Forest â he was the first player in Premier League history to be subbed on that late in a game and achieve that.Following a 2-0 win away at Man City, Thomas Frank is looking to become just the third Spurs manager to win his first two away top-flight matches in charge of the club, along with Ossie Ardiles in 1993-94 and Tim Sherwood in 2013-14.Jarrod Bowen has had a hand in nine Premier League goals in his last nine appearances (6 goals, 3 assists). Since his first appearance under Graham Potter in early February, only Mohamed Salah (15) has scored and assisted more goals than Bowen (9 goals, 4 assists) in the Premier League.Tottenham Hotspur defender Pedro Porro has played 86 Premier League games but never been involved in a 0-0 draw, an all-time record without featuring in one. Itâs the second-longest start to a Premier League career without a 0-0, with only MikaÃ«l Silvestre going more games from his debut without a goalless one (134 matches before featuring in Man Utd 0-0 Arsenal in September 2003).HomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCBBC emails for youAdvertise with usCopyright Â© 2025 BBC.
