Weird question: I would like to make a PDF file that is unreadable on a screen, and must be printed on paper in order to be read. Is this possible?
I suspect this is impossible because of the ability to "print to file" but I wonder if there's a way to produce a redacted document with an embedded hook that removes the redaction when the file is sent to an actual printer. I have looked at the PDF spec, and it's somewhat intimidating. Any ideas?
Thanks

we made pdfs that were built to meet a deadline which was imposible so we sent a file that could not be viewed and then since it was not a pdf they could not print anything except garbage
and we got a time extension to retransmit after fixing the corruptions (we intoduced) so the answer is yes certainly but there will be no meaningful charted characters

HMM YES there is a PDF set of objects that can be print not view but you need to read the manual.

I think that is not possible, once you make it in PDF file it is now digital which readable on screen and there still no technology that provides "Print to File" hook.

Adobe included the ability to write text that is not visible so like invisible ink it would show in a printout but it would be very easy to flagon on off. As you say e-files are totaly editable so a signature can be replaced or protection removed as it just often needs one bit changed.
