Market Update: ED, IP, ROK, UAL
Stocks are mixed at midday on Wednesday. The Federal Reserve comes out with its latest rate decision today at 2pm, followed by the usual press conference with Chairman Jerome Powell. This time Wall Street gets the added bonus of the Fed's dot plot which is a predicting tool for the future of rates. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note is 4.04%. Crude oil is at $63 per barrel.

Technical Assessment: Bullish in the Intermediate-Term
The stock market paused on Tuesday ahead of the FOMC's decision on interest rates at 2:00 p.m. today. It's also possible that the major indices were taking a breather after a pretty nice run over the nine days ending September 15. The S&P 500 (SPX) has gained 3.1% in that period, the S&P 100 has popped 4%, the Invesco S&P 500 Top 50 (XLG) and the Nasdaq have ripped higher by about 5%, and the Nasdaq 100 has gained 4.6%.
While a 25-basis-point cut in the fed funds rate seems to be a lock, investor opinions about additional rate cuts going into the end of 2025 and into 2026 are all over the place. That could be why the options market has witnessed a decent move higher in premiums over the past two days. The volatility index (VIX) jumped 6% on Monday and tacked on another 4.3% on Tuesday. While a two-day advance of almost 11% for the VIX is common, it almost always happens during quick price declines in the S&P 500. Indeed, every 10%-20% pop in the VIX over a two-day period during the past year has been due to a fast drop in the SPX. But not this time, as investors are gobbling up options and pushing up premiums to hedge against either a "sell the news" event or for protection if Chairman Powell unleashes a hawkish press conference following the fed funds announcement.
We don't have historical data, but total VIX call and put volume for the September 17 expiration was a huge 463,000 contracts and total VIX option volume for all expirations was massive at 1.8 million. That's almost a 100% jump in volume based on a monthly average. (Mark Arbeter, CMT)
