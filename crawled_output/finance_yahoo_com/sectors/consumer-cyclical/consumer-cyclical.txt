Market Update: ETR, BBWI
Stock indices are flat at midday on Friday, having been slightly higher early in the session but inching into the red as midday nears. Investors are monitoring conversations that are underway between President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping of China, with the trade relationship between the two companies the top issue.
Also likely on the agenda is the framework of a deal to keep TikTok operating in the U.S. Stocks are on track to move higher for the week, with traders processing the recent interest-rate cut, the conclusion of a generally pleasing earnings season, and inflation news that is mostly benign. Argus• 5 hours ago
Technical Assessment: Bullish in the Intermediate-Term
Nine stocks (NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, GOOGL, AMZN, META, AVGO, TSM, TSLA) have trillion-dollar market caps and total about $23 trillion dollars. Maybe we should rename the Mag 7 the Mag 9? Eight of the nine are in the S&P 500 and make up a whopping 35% of the index! TSM is not in the SPX because S&P's selection committee considers only companies with U.S. headquarters. TSM makes up 23% of the iShares MSCI Taiwan ETF (EWT). The eight U.S. stocks represent an incredible 50% of the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ).
If we were to add five more stocks (NFLX, COST, PLTR, TMUS, and CSCO) to the above eight, the 13 stocks represent a whopping 60% of the QQQ. We point this out because these indices, in our opinion, are no longer considered a way to get diversification in a total portfolio. They are, in fact, a huge wager on artificial intelligence (AI) and almost everything else that has to do with technology. In a smaller way, they are a bet on consumer spending. So far, and probably for the foreseeable future, investments in these indices have worked like a charm.
Our concerns about the technical position of the stock market have gone unheeded. When markets ignore momentum divergences, bearish chart patterns, high insider selling (especially in IT), exuberant sentiment, lagging breadth, and weak seasonals, it is categorically bullish. Using price alone as the final arbiter, the indices never gave us reason to be concerned. Until that happens, the very calm crawl higher seems likely to continue. By the way, the second half of September is supposed to be the worst part of the year for stocks, but we will see. (Mark Arbeter, CMT) Argus• 10 hours ago
