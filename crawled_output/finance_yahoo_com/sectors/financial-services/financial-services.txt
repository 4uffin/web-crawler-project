Technical Assessment: Bullish in the Intermediate-Term
The FOMC cut the fed funds rate by an expected 25 basis points (bps), bringing the target rate down to 4.00% to 4.25%. It was the first action by the Fed since it cut rates at the end of 2024. Chairman Powell indicated that two more 25 bps cuts could be made by the end of the year. He suggested that Wednesday's move was a "risk management cut," and added that a very different picture of risks has emerged as the labor market has started to cool.
The CME FedWatch Tool is showing an 88% probability of a 25-bps cut at the October 29 meeting and an 81% chance of another 25-bps cut at the December 10 meeting.
The 10-year Treasury yield dropped about five bps to 4% right after the Fed cut, but reversed higher, finishing at 4.08%. Both the five-year and the two-year also fell about five bps following the cut, but ended higher on the day. The 10-year has fallen from an intraday high of 4.63% on May 22 to an intraday low of 4% on Wednesday; the five-year has dropped from 4.17% to 3.53% during a similar time period; and the two-year has declined from 4.1% on 5/14 to a low of 3.47% on 9/5. Yields across the curve have cycled into oversold territory on a daily basis and -- at least in the short-term -- we may see some upward pressure as yields are stretched to the downside.
On Wednesday, investors took more profits in the two largest semiconductor names, with NVDA losing 2.6% and AVGO shedding 3.8%. Once again, the NVDA chart is looking suspect in the short term and appears to be rolling over. A break of the recent closing low of $167 could open the door for a drop to strong support in the $145-$150 area. (Mark Arbeter, CMT)
