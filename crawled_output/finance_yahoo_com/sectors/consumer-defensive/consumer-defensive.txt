Market Digest: HRL
The stock market paused on Tuesday ahead of the FOMC's decision on interest rates at 2:00 p.m. today. It's also possible that the major indices are taking a breather after a pretty nice run over the nine days ending September 15. The S&P 500 (SPX) has gained 3.1% in that period, the S&P 100 has popped 4%, the Invesco S&P 500 Top 50 (XLG) and the Nasdaq have ripped higher by about 5%, and the Nasdaq 100 has gained 4.6%.
While a 25-basis-point cut in the fed funds rate seems to be a lock, investor opinions about additional rate cuts going into the end of 2025 and into 2026 are all over the place. That could be why the options market has witnessed a decent move higher in premiums over the past two days. The volatility index (VIX) jumped 6% on Monday and tacked on another 4.3% on Tuesday. While a two-day advance of almost 11% for the VIX is common, it almost always happens during quick price declines in the S&P 500. Indeed, every 10%-20% pop in the VIX over a two-day period during the past year has been due to a fast drop in the SPX. But not this time, as investors are gobbling up options and pushing up premiums to hedge against either a 'sell the news' event or for protection if Chairman Powell unleashes a hawkish press conference following the fed funds announcement. We don't have historical data, but total VIX call and put volume for the September 17 expiration was a whopping 463,000 contracts and total VIX option volume for all expirations was massive at 1.8 million. That is almost a 100% jump in volume based on a monthly average.
