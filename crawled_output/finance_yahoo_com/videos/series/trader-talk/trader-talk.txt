Wall Street wisdom without the BS. Kenny Polcari keeps it real for everyday investors.
Wednesdays 2 PM ET
Featured
How Black Monday changed Wall Street forever You can catch Trader Talk on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, or wherever you get your podcasts. What if one phone call told you the market was on fire? On Trader Talk, Kenny Polcari relives Black Monday with First Boston trader John Parasco, the 1987 crash that erased half a trillion dollars in hours. Hear how specialists begged for firm capital, hedge funds dumped portfolios alphabetically, and blue chips like Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) lost half their value in a single day. A raw inside floor account of chaos, fear, and survival when Wall Street stared into the abyss. Watch more episodes of Trader Talk here. Trader Talk with Kenny Polcari on Yahoo Finance delivers expert analysis and actionable insights, empowering you to navigate market volatility and secure your financial future. This post was written by Langston Sessoms.
