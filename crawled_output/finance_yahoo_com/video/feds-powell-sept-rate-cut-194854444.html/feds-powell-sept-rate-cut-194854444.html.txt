Fed's Powell: Sept. rate cut helps manage labor market risks
Yahoo Finance Video
Wed, Sep 17, 2025, 12:48 PM
After the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 25 basis points, Fed Chair Jerome Powell indicated at a press conference on Wednesday that labor supply risks were a major factor in the central bank's decision. Central bank officials are signaling two more rate cuts to come in the remaining 2025 months. Yahoo Finance senior Fed reporter Jennifer Schonberger reacts to Powell's latest remarks.

Fed Chair J. Powell clearly saying that the balance of risks have shifted more towards the labor market, noting that the drop in supply of workers and drop in demand for workers has really caught Fed officials' attention. He noted that it was really those downside risks to the labor market that drove today's cut. He referred to it as a risk management cut. Take a listen.
00:26
J. Powell
I think you could think of this in a way as a risk management cut because if you look at the SEP actually, um the projections for growth this year and next actually ticked up just a little bit and inflation and unemployment didn't really move what. So what what's different now? What's different now is that you see a very different picture of the risks to the labor market. You've seen, you know, we were looking at 150,000 jobs a month at the time of the last meeting. And now we see the revisions and we see the new numbers. And I I didn't I don't want to put too much emphasis on on payroll job creation, but it's just one of the things that suggests that the labor market is really cooling off.
01:21
Jen
Now, Powell said the Fed is going to take meet these rate cuts meeting by meeting even though two more cuts have been pencilled in by the median. He again said, look, you should look at the SEP and the dot plot, which is the interest rate projection that each member of the FOMC pencils in as sort of a is not set in stone, so it could change. So again, kind of taking this meeting by meeting based on the data. As far as inflation,
01:52

Fed Chair J. Powell noted that they still see any impact from tariffs as a one-time increase in prices, but that they will change course if they feel that inflation is going to be turning persistent. Now, he was also peppered with questions on Fed independence, particularly the fact that newly minted Fed Governor Stephen Myron is still retaining his post at the White House. Uh Chair Powell saying that um we're strongly committed to maintaining independence. Beyond that, he had nothing to say. But he did have this to say on Fed independence and the decisions that Fed officials make.
02:44
J. Powell
It's deeply in our culture to do to do our work based on the incoming data and and and never consider anything else. That's just everybody who's at the Fed really feels strongly about that way. So, you know, you'll know it by the way we talk about what we're doing, by by the speeches that people give, by the decisions that we make, you'll know that we're just still going to do that. That's all we do. Um and we don't we don't frame these questions at all or see them in in terms of political outcomes.
03:22
Jen
And Chair Pell again talking about the impact of immigration on the labor market, the fact that that is putting downward pressure on the supply of workers as we're also seeing demand for workers drop. And it is probably the reason why Fed officials have penciled in three cuts, so two more remaining cuts this year, which is why they see growth continuing to continue through this year and rebound into next year. It seems to be the case that these cuts that they've put in place is what is going to keep the economy humming going forward. Josh.

All right, great stuff as always. Thank you, Jen.
