China has reportedly banned firms from buying Nvidia (NVDA) products, according to reporting from the Financial Times. Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Allie Canal outlines the details. Check out Yahoo Finance's interview with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief.
Video Transcript

Speaker A
I want to turn to another story that we are watching closely, and that is the continuing negotiations between the US and China with Nvidia sort of in the middle as a pawn and all of this. As we talked about, the FT is reporting that China's instructed its companies to not buy Nvidia chips. And I recently had a talk the chance to talk to Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Wong, following its earnings and asked him, you know, how necessary is China even for the business? This is what he said.
00:43
Jensen Huang
Every American technology company, um, for every every American technology company, China is important to them. It's an important market. It's also, as you know, it's just really large. It's the second largest computing market in the world. Um, and um, I I'm I'm just delighted that President Trump uh sees the wisdom of American leadership and and particularly at this time uh where AI is taking off, it's vital that America wins the AI race.
01:21
Speaker A
And yet, Ally, you know, the shares, yes, they're down this morning a little more than a percent, but we it doesn't seem as though investors are especially concerned. Um, you know, the shares are still up 30% this year for example.
01:41
Allie
Right. and China is an important market to Nvidia, but it is not the most important market. There certainly is a lot of demand here in the US as well. But this does mark a significant escalation. Now, regulators have previously targeted Nvidia's H20 chips. Those were those paired back processors meant to uh comply with those US export controls. Now the directive extends to the RTX Pro 6000D. That's Nvidia's newest AI chips, customized for China, a lower-powered version of its flagship processor, meant to comply with those same rules. But the timing is also notable. Just a few days ago, uh China accused Nvidia of violating its anti-monopoly law. This comes as President Trump continues to push policies restricting China's access to US chips. At the same time, China is trying to lessen its dependence on US technologies for these exact reasons. And like you said, shares are down slightly in pre-market trading. We did hear from Nvidia's CEO Jensen Wong responding to this report. He said he was quote disappointed, but understood that China and the US have larger geopolitical issues to work out. He described Nvidia's business in China as a bit of a roller coaster and stressed that the company has guided Wall Street not to factor China into its financial forecast given the policy uncertainty. And that may be why we're seeing a bit more muted reaction in shares, because even without China, guidance wasn't too bad in the latest quarter. So, if this China uh issue is resolved, that could be a further boon for Nvidia down the line here. But like you said, Nvidia once again a pawn in this game between the US, China as these trade negotiations continue. President Trump will be meeting with Xi Jinping on Friday. I'm sure this will be a big talking point.
