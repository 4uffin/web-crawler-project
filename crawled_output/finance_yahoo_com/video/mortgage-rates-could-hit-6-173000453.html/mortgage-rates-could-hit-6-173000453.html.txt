Mortgage rates could hit 6% 'by year-end': NAR chief economist

The Federal Reserve's interest rate decision comes as mortgage rates are at their lowest level in a year, while housing starts plunged in August. National Association of Realtors (NAR) chief economist Lawrence Yun joins Market Catalysts with Julie Hyman to discuss how interest rate cuts could impact the housing market and what falling mortgage rates mean for housing demand. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Catalysts.
Video Transcript
00:00
Speaker A
Mortgage rates are at the lowest levels we've seen in a year, while the Federal Reserve's benchmark interest rate does not directly affect mortgage rates, they are connected. So how will a cutting cycle affect the housing market? Lawrence Yun, National Association of Realtors' Chief Economist is joining me now. Good to see you, Lawrence. We also have the backdrop of housing starts which showed some weakness, the lowest since May last month. So that reflecting one part of the housing market as well. But
00:23
Speaker A
as the Fed cuts today, what happens to mortgage rates?
00:32
Lawrence Yun
Uh well, uh you know, mortgage rate is not a one to one relationship with the Federal Reserve, but nonetheless, directionally, uh it tends to move in the similar. Uh so we saw that mortgage rates have already fallen in anticipation of the Federal Reserve rate cut today uh for certain. Uh and then I think the question is how many additional rounds of rate cut in the upcoming months. Uh in my view, uh at least through this year
00:56
Lawrence Yun
could be two or three additional, uh and then next year even more. So we are looking at downward cycle in interest rate uh market condition. Uh this is a great news for potential home buyers uh who have been priced out, but now with lower rates, their purchasing power increases and we expect more buyers to begin to knock on the door.
01:14
Speaker A
But are we going to see any movement on price, Lawrence? Because that too, just forget about the mortgage for a minute. The actual prices of homes have also been an obstacle.
01:27
Lawrence Yun
Uh so the home prices have been in a spectacular increase from five years ago. Compare now with pre Covid condition, many markets seeing about 50, 60% price appreciation and he has really not come down in many markets. Uh we have seen some markets like Florida and Texas, uh additional inventory, uh some price adjustment in those areas. People should view it as a second chance opportunity to get in given the strong job creation in those states.
01:58
Lawrence Yun
Uh but uh what we anticipate uh is that uh with the income rising roughly 4%, if home prices can rise below that level, it will be healthy development. But today's this morning's housing permits data, which is a lowest in a year, that's not a good sign. That means we could face housing shortage again. So we need to ensure there's an adequate supply once the buyers come into the market. any uh unnecessary obstacle to building more homes, those need to be removed because we need more supply to match up with the anticipated rising demand.
02:22
Speaker A
Well, what are the biggest obstacles at this point?
02:26
Lawrence Yun
Well, you know, sometimes, you know, you ask the home builders, some of the permit requirement in some states, it could run up to even $50,000 just to get a housing permit. and then you look for the land and then there's lack of land uh condition. Um, and the so we have to look at all the areas, see some of the uh cost of construction is also rising. Uh maybe even the workers, you know, do we need to train more Americans to go into trade school
02:52
Lawrence Yun
so they have the necessary skill to become plumbers, uh working the carpentry. so we have adequate supply so that builders can keep building without any facing any restrictions. So we have to look at all those angles.
03:04
Speaker A
Well, that that labor angle is an interesting one because where are those bodies coming from, right? Are those the the knowledge workers who aren't who are getting displaced by AI? because if you look at population growth, is that enough to support the the labor force in something like construction?
03:22
Lawrence Yun
Uh you know, naturally, we will let the market determine anytime there is a labor shortage, uh there will be increase in pay opportunity. and people need to remember, the construction industry actually pays above national average. uh And furthermore, uh many of the construction job is not necessarily manual job, you know, people are sitting on a tractor, they're moving certain gears to move things. Uh so and I think people need to consider alternative, maybe in America, we have tilted a little more towards trying to send every high school graduate
03:52
Lawrence Yun
into four- year colleges. maybe we don't need that. Uh maybe some people can go into trade school and then start earning uh without even having a student uh debt load condition. So, uh but certainly, we need more supply because demand once mortgage rate begins to go down, uh and I think the mortgage rate go will go down towards 6%. uh if anything under 6%, consider that as a bonus, uh but that is clearly better than 7%, 8%
04:18
Lawrence Yun
that many consumers face uh in the past couple of years.
04:23
Speaker A
How quickly do you think we'll get there, Lawrence?
04:25
Lawrence Yun
Uh mortgage rate right now, as you mentioned, uh we are already at one year low, uh 6.3%. So we are very close to that. But I think key is uh what the Federal Reserve communicates this afternoon about how they see the labor market, how they see inflationary pressure or disinflationary pressure out there. And then the market can sort of assess how many more rate cut there will be down the line. Um and then 6% mortgage rate by the year end.
04:54
Lawrence Yun
I think that's a clear possibility. In our analysis, that just means that we are going to have another three or four million American households uh based on income distribution who would qualify for a mortgage, who were not able to qualify early part of the year. Of course, not everyone will buy a home, but at least the pool of eligible buyers is beginning to increase.
