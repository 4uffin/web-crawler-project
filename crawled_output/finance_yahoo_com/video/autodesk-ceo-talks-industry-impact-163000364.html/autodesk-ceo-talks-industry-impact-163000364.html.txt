Video Transcript
00:00
Speaker A
you guys have been rolling out a bunch of new AI assisted products. Now, from a user perspective, um and most of your users are professional creators, whether it be architects, designers, people in entertainment, etc. How is the user difference go, how is the user experience going to be different uh when using some of these new products?
00:23
Speaker B
Yeah, so, you know, the tools people use to create models of real things that are going to be built, roads, bridges, buildings, cars, cell phones, products of any variety. It's actually really complicated to build these models. because these models have a lot of fidelity, they have a lot of detail. And what we're trying to do is we're trying to focus the user on what the they're trying to do, the problem they're trying to solve, the aesthetic they're trying to create and try to remove some of the labor of building a 3D model that is physically accurate, physically detailed. So, the workflow changes in a way where the users are actually focused on, what do I want? What are the problems I I want to solve? What are the details I want to specify? And the model gets created for them in incremental steps. It's a huge productivity unlock for our customers. And actually, it removes a lot of work that they don't actually enjoy as part of their jobs.
01:21
Speaker A
Interesting. And so going forward, how impactful do you think this is going to be for your results in terms of demand. You know, as I'm sure you're aware, there's a lot of debate out in the world, especially when we're talking about B2B products like yours, about what the demand is actually like for these AI powered products. So, how is it going to flow through to growth for your company?
01:54
Speaker B
Yeah, Julia, I I think you're raising a good point. These changes don't happen overnight. You know, despite all of the hype and all of the energy around AI, people don't immediately wake up one day and move all of their design processes, all of their make processes to AI generated solutions. So, what you're going to see is incremental progress to moving towards these solutions over time, moving away from some of these more complex heavyweight solutions to some of these more machine-assisted solutions. And what we've tried to do is not only build the future, but also build the path to the future, make it easy for the teams to work with the new AI tools while still working with their existing tools. So it's going to take time, especially in complex public Works industries like civil infrastructure, roads and bridges, but you have to understand, and it's important for us to recognize that these industries have a massive capacity problem. They don't have enough money, they don't have enough people, they don't have enough material to build and rebuild everything that needs to be built and rebuilt. So they need these tools in order to drive that kind of productivity gain.
03:08
Speaker A
Um at the same time, presumably you guys will be making more money from these tools. In other words, they're more expensive than your existing models or can people, you know, sort of buy a software upgrade of their existing product?
03:30
Speaker B
Yeah, in some cases we actually ship the new AI features with the existing products, so they're able to use the two together. But if you look out to the future, what you're going to see is people are going to be using these tools in a much more consumptive fashion. They're going to be pulling all sorts of capabilities in certain directions, and they're going to be touching the entire life cycle. So historically Autodesk has been a design software company, but over the last few years we have become a design and make software company touching the entire life cycle. So where we are going to be creating benefit for both ourselves and the customers is by connecting the elements of that life cycle together in high-speed intelligent ways, allowing architects and and construction professionals to work together seamlessly, allowing engineers and manufacturing professionals to work together seamlessly. There's a lot of value creation in terms of making those processes more seamless, more connected and more simultaneous.
