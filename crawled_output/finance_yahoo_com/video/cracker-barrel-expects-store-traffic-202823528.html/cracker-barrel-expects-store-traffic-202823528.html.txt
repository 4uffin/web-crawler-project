Cracker Barrel expects store traffic decline in mixed Q4 results
Yahoo Finance Video

In this video:
CBRL
Cracker Barrel Old Country Store (CBRL) shares are falling in extended hours after the restaurant chain posted mixed fiscal fourth quarter earnings — revenue of $868 million (vs. estimates of $854.7 million), adjusted earnings of $0.74 per share (vs. estimates of $0.76) — while projecting a decline in store traffic between 4 to 7%. Yahoo Finance senior reporter Brooke DiPalma reviews Cracker Barrel's latest earnings release and 2026 guidance figures after facing consumer backlash to its redesign plan.

Video Transcript
00:00
Speaker A
We'll turn it out a cracker barrel, company reporting its fourth quarter results and Yahoo Finance's Brooke De Palma joins me here to break it all down. Investors, don't look so happy with this one, Brooke.
00:13
Brooke DiPalma
Investors not too pleased. And that's largely because of the outlook that the company provided. The company did say that they now expect total revenue for the fiscal year between 3.35 billion to 3.45 billion. That, they said assumes a comparable sales or rather a comparable store traffic decline of between 4 to 7%.
00:37
Brooke DiPalma
Now, this stock is something that has gotten so much attention in the last month alone. Shares are down about 20%. And that's largely because of the backlash that the company has gotten based upon their rebrand of the logo. They have since now returned or rather returned to what was their previous prior logo and also they paused on redesigns that the company has been undergoing. But keep in mind, earlier this year, the company was posting major renovation plans, major, you know, new redesign plans, and really making a $700 million investment.
01:17
Brooke DiPalma
And we did see just a bit of that, you know, play off a bit. They did beat on their top line coming in at 868 million, but they did miss on earnings. That came in around 74 cents, 2 cents lower than what the street projected. If you also take a look at same store sales growth during the quarter, they did have restaurant comp sales increased by 5.4%. That was more than the 3.43% that the street had projected, but their retail same store sales did decline just ever so slightly.
01:44
Brooke DiPalma
But really back to this outlook. After that backlash had happened, we heard from so many on the street that this could cause some hubbub, cause some, you know, excitement for consumers to return. And now, based upon this outlook, they're saying that they expect a store traffic decline of 4 to 7%, it's certainly not what investors want to hear, especially after all the attention that it got it. They thought that maybe it would stir up some commotion and excitement to return.
02:23
Speaker A
All right, we're down about almost 8% here. What are you listening for on the call?
02:28
Brooke DiPalma
Well, we're really listening to how exactly the future of that $700 million redesign and next generation of cracker barrel will actually turn out to be, especially because now, well, one of those ways in which they were using that investment was towards the redesign of the restaurants and of the logo with the major marketing campaigns. And so, I really think that investors right now are looking for some clear direction on how exactly this future design of Cracker Barrel will be.
03:00
Brooke DiPalma
We know they put a pause on redesigns. We know they reverted to their old logo. So where exactly is that $700 million investment going? What does it look like and what's their future growth plan here for Cracker Barrel? And how will it get underway after this major backlash we've seen?
03:24
Speaker A
All right, we'll see. Thank you, Brooke. Appreciate it.
