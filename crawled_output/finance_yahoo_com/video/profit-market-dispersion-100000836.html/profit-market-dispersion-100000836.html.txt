Speaker B
Let's just start with your big picture overview of the markets right now and how you're seeing things.
00:04
Speaker A
Yeah, you know, I think the thing to know about is the economy and that that's growing. The US economy is growing at about 2%. You know, you have to look closely at the numbers to figure that out. The GDP numbers year- to- date for the first half were 1 and a half percent, but there's another number called GDI, which is gross domestic income. And if we remember college macro, if we attended college macro, we would know that GDP and GDI should be the same. Well, they they are over the long term, but they they, you know,
00:30
Speaker A
reporting period to reporting period can be a little different. The GDI is giving a hotter number than the GDP. and it's about 2% for the first half of the year and that's despite what was happening in the government with layoffs, with trade policy changes. So we think that that's a a good sign and current data coming out recently also looking okay.
00:54
Speaker B
Yeah, and um, you know, it sounds like there might be a little dispersion between those two numbers. Um, but that's not really what we're. Yeah, we're that is our word of the day. And I'm going to break it down right here, but typically it means something else in investing,
01:05
Speaker B
which is how much returns differ across stocks, sectors or asset classes. High dispersion means bigger gaps between winners and losers. So, how do you, how does you as an investor identify some of these gaps in real time and hopefully profit from them?
01:22
Speaker A
Well, it's all about what's going to drive the future and that that that's the, you know, the the the tricky part, isn't it? And picking picking what's going to happen in the future. Um, and so typically what we look at are recent uh, trends that matter for the future. And one of the things we look at a lot are what's happening in earnings. So, we just got through a big earnings reporting season in the US and outside the US, actually. And that gave us a lot of insight into that those dispersion questions. You know,
01:50
Speaker A
you have to ask yourself, where do I want to identify the dispersion? So something I look at a lot is US versus non-US stocks and then within US stocks, what styles of stocks?
01:58
Speaker C
Does that mean you need to be a more active investor versus a passive investor if we do see a greater dispersion among certain companies or sectors?
02:07
Speaker A
The efficient market hypothesis would tell you no. They that you can buy a cap weighted uh index and and hold it and um that's a perfectly reasonable answer. You can do a little bit better if you take advantage of dispersion, but that's where model portfolios come in.
