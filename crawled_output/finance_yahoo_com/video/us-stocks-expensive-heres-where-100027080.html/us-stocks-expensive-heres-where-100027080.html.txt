Speaker A
US stocks are expensive. That gives me high confidence that you can do better elsewhere
00:04
Speaker A
uh uh on a 10-year horizon, probably on a five-year horizon.
00:09
Speaker A
Uh US growth stocks in particular are frothy and expensive. Um, we have a interactive website, uh Asset allocation interactive that forecasts forward returns on 130 different asset classes.
00:20
Speaker A
And it uses simple yield plus historical growth and income, plus something some element of mean reversion back to historic norms. And
00:26
Speaker A
that points to a a total return for US growth stocks over the next 10 years of 1 and a half percent. That's all.
00:31
Speaker B
That's not very much. So you said you could do better elsewhere. Where is the elsewhere?
00:34
Speaker A
US value is up around 5 and a half percent.
00:37
Speaker A
Not brilliant, but not bad. Uh, international, about seven, emerging markets, about eight.
00:42
Speaker A
Um, uh, international value, about nine, emerging markets value, about 10.
00:45
Speaker A
If you can get 10% per annum over the next 10 years versus 1 and a half percent per annum,
00:49
Speaker A
go for the 10.
00:50
Speaker B
Yeah, yeah.
