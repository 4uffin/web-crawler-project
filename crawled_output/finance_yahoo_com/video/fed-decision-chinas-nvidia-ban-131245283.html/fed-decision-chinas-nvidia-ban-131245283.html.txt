Let's get to the three things you need to know today. First up, US stock futures holding steady ahead of the Fed rate decision due at 2 p.m. Eastern time today. The Federal Reserve widely expected to cut interest rates at its meeting amid growing signs of weakness in the labor market. This would mark the first rate cut from the Fed since 2024, and traders are betting on more ahead. All eyes will be on Fed Chair Jay Powell's press conference for clues on the central bank's path forward. Plus, China reportedly banning.Companies from purchasing invidious AI chips. According to the Financial Times, China's internet watchdog has instructed companies to terminate orders for invidious chips. Among the buyer canceling orders, Alibaba, TikTok parent company ByteDance. The decision marks an escalation in US-China trade tensions ahead of a planned call between Trump and Xi this Friday. And during that call, the president will discuss the state of TikTok's US operations. If all goes to plan, the social media's US operation.would be acquired by several companies including Oracle, venture capital firm Andries and Horowitz, and private equity firm Silver Lake. That's according to Bloomberg. TikTok's ban was set to go into effect today, but the deadline has now been extended until December. The deal calls for Oracle to continue providing cloud services for TikTok. Oracle already works with the company to host user data in the US as part of a multi-billion dollar partnership that TikTok has dubbed Project Texas.
