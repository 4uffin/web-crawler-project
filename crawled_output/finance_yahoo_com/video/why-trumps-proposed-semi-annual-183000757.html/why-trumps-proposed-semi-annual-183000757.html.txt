Why Trump's proposed semi-annual earnings could be a 'good idea'

President Trump has called for changes on Wall Street, proposing that companies report earnings results semi-annually rather than quarterly. After taking a look at Yahoo Finance's recent interviews with corporate executives, Harvard University executive fellow and former Medtronic CEO, Bill George, and University of Calgary professor of law and N. Murray Edwards chair in business law, Bryce Tingle, explain why less frequent reporting could benefit companies and investors. Check out Yahoo Finance's interviews with Cisco (CSCO) President Jeetu Patel, Okta (OKTA) CEO Todd McKinnon, and Best Buy (BBY) CEO Corie Barry.

Video Transcript
00:00
Speaker A
President Trump is proposing changes to the way that publicly traded companies report earnings, saying a switch from quarterly reporting to just twice a year would be beneficial for companies. We got a chance to speak to a few executives this morning and got their take on Trump's suggestion.
00:22
Speaker B
It's not a bad way to kind of incentivize long-term thinking rather than just a quarterly outlook.
00:33
Speaker C
I'd be okay either way. Uh I do like the opportunity to talk to investors uh every quarter about the business and the future and the vision of what we're trying to do. Um but I do think sometimes the industry gets too uh obsessed with the quarterly numbers and infers too many from too much uh forward guidance and forward momentum or lack thereof from a single quarter.
00:54
Speaker D
Sometimes, I think when you're in a really volatile backdrop, you do want to be laying some of that groundwork quarterly. For me, that's less about the forecast and more just about providing color just like what we're talking about about the business. Yeah. That being said, I think we're all trying to find ways to free up capacity and make sure we're spending capacity in the most value-added areas.
01:16
Speaker A
Joining me now with their thoughts on the matter, Bill George, Harvard Executive Education fellow and former CEO of Medtronic, and Bryce Tingle, University of Calgary professor of business law. Thank you both for being here. I have to say, Bryce, what a coincidence. You wrote a a piece uh for the New York Times, an op-ed that was published yesterday that just more broadly looked at changes that you think need to happen in terms of regulation of U.S. corporations. Then here comes President Trump proposing this. Do you think this specifically, this the changing of the timing of reporting of earnings would be a helpful change as well?
02:27
Bryce Tingle
Well, I'd like to think I inspired President Trump. Um... But, um, I think it's a I think it's a good idea, to be honest. Uh, London uh has uh survived for centuries as an important financial center and they use semi-annual reporting. Um, I don't think we should be making rules about this sort of thing. I think shareholders and uh managers of businesses are perfectly capable of determining uh what the right reporting uh schedule is. I think there's a lot of companies that would benefit from uh lower costs associated with financial reporting and with benefit maybe from a longer-term focus that not having to uh uh sort of address quarterly performance every three months would would permit. So I think it's a good idea.
03:22
Speaker A
Bill, you you've been in that CEO spe- seat. You've had to, you know, be on this cadence, this hamster wheel maybe, uh of quarterly reporting. Is it a blessing or is it a curse or somewhere in between?
03:41
Bill George
Oh, I I very much favor going to semi-annual reporting. I think you'll find most all CEOs do uh to some of the comments made earlier. There's no reason they can't meet with their investors and talk to them every quarter, tell them generally how things are going, as long as they tell all the investors and not just inside information. But I do think that this would be very salutary in getting people to focus more on the long-term. Right now, all the CEOs are have to play the expectations game because the market demands it. If we can stretch that out to a twice a year, I think it will give much more focus on strategy, uh give us more opportunities to invest longer term in research and development, new capital, uh facilities expenditures. So I'm very much favor the uh the longer term and I hope that uh we move in this direction. I think President Trump gets it right, so does Bryce.
