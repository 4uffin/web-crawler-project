iPhone 17 Won’t Bring ‘Super Cycle’ for Apple (AAPL), AT&T CEO Says

We recently published 10 Stock News You Should Pay Attention To. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the stocks to watch in September. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is trending after the company revealed its new iPhone 17. While many on Wall Street are expecting the company to benefit from an upgrade “super cycle,” some say the new device would not bring strong sales for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). AT&T CEO John Stankey recently said that he does not believe the new device will result in a super cycle for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). “It’s obviously important to a large portion of our customer base that use those devices. So, we do watch it closely and have obviously worked with Apple for many years as a partner in distributing their equipment. I’m not expecting it’s going to be anything what I would call earthshattering or framebreaking. Every time you’re not anticipating a super cycle. I’m not anticipating the infamous super super cycle, but who knows? The customer will ultimately decide that,” Stankey said, according to CNBC.
Photo by Alexandr Bormotin on Unsplash Baron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter: “Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a leading manufacturer of consumer electronics, computer software, and online services. Shares declined amid mounting headwinds, including new U.S. tariffs on Apple’s China centric supply chain, which are pressuring gross margins, and increased regulatory scrutiny of the App Store model in both the U.S. and Europe. These developments have introduced greater uncertainty around the growth and profitability of Apple’s high margin services business. While we continue to admire Apple’s brand, ecosystem, and long-term innovation capabilities, the ongoing regulatory overhang and heightened risk to margins and growth prospects led us to exit the position and reallocate capital to holdings with more compelling risk/return profiles.”
While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk. If you are looking for an extremely cheap AI stock that is also a major beneficiary of Trump tariffs and onshoring, see our free report on the best short-term AI stock.
