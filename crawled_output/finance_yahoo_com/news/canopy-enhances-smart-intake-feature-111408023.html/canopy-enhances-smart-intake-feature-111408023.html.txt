Canopy, the practice management platform serving accounting practices, has enhanced its Smart Intake feature with the introduction of AI Document Request Lists. The new functionality employs AI to produce personalised lists for client documents, reducing the time required by companies to gather tax-related information.
With the AI Document Request Lists, Canopy analyses clients' tax information to generate a list of documents needed. Accountants have the option to adjust these lists by adding or subtracting items to ensure clients provide what is needed. The feature is designed to minimise the need for repeated communication by incorporating automated reminders for both the company and clients. Canopy's $70m funding round in April 2025 was directed towards enhancing its product, with the AI Document Request Lists being one of the improvements financed by this investment. Canopy enables company members to use internal data to create predictive checklists tailored to each client. Over the next few months, Canopy is expanding the AI Document Request Lists to include bookkeeping and audit requests.
The platform will also allow users to create templates and input prompts to assist the AI, which is particularly useful for generating multiple predictive lists. The Smart Intake feature generates customised document request lists based on individual client projects, creates questionnaires, consolidates requests into a single client interface and enables the creation of requests for several clients at once. Further developments in Smart Intake will see the introduction of AI-based Questionnaires, allowing companies to generate surveys with the help of Canopy's AI. In the upcoming months, Canopy is set to release an enhanced version of its proposals and engagements tool, make improvements to its billing system and integrate more AI features into its existing products.
Canopy Product VP Hanna Bjornn said: “Client intake has historically been one of the most time-consuming parts of the accounting workflow, for both practitioners and their clients. With AI Document Request Lists, we are eliminating that back-and-forth and replacing it with an intelligent, automated experience that ensures firms get the right documents the first time.” "Canopy enhances Smart Intake feature to streamline document collection " was originally created and published by International Accounting Bulletin, a GlobalData owned brand.
