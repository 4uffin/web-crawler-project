Trump's UK visit brings flurry of trade announcements as US-India talk tariffs Yahoo Finance is chronicling the latest news and updates on Trump's tariffs.

Trump tariffs could fund bailout for US farmers, says agriculture secretary, FT reports The Trump administration is drawing up plans to use tariff revenue to fund a program to support U.S. farmers as they head into harvest facing falling export sales and rising input costs, the Financial Times reported on Thursday, citing agriculture secretary Brooke Rollins. "There may be circumstances under which we will be very seriously looking to and announcing a package soon," Rollins told the newspaper in an interview on Wednesday.

Brazil's beef exports to US to fall further in September after tariffs, industry group says SAO PAULO (Reuters) -Brazil's beef exports to the United States are seen falling further in September from the previous months, the head of local beef lobby Abiec said on Wednesday, in a move linked to higher tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump on goods from Brazil.
Roberto Perosa said that beef exports to the U.S. should fall to about 7,000 metric tons in September, from around 9,000 tons in August and 30,000 tons per month in the period preceding the tariffs, which came into force in August.
The U.S. used to be the second-largest buyer of beef from Brazil, the world's largest exporter, only behind China.

FedEx profit to be dragged down by US tariffs on previously exempt parcels LOS ANGELES (Reuters) -FedEx will report a quarterly profit hit from President Donald Trump's decision to end tariff-exempt treatment for popular direct-to-consumer shipments when the global delivery firm reports results on Thursday, analysts said.
FedEx's fiscal first quarter, which ended on August 31, captures the impact from the May 2 end of "de minimis" exemptions for packages from China and Hong Kong.
The U.S. also removed de minimis exemptions for the rest of the world on August 29, with full financial effects yet to come.

Trump, Modi Talk in Bid to Calm Tariffs, Russian Oil Dispute US President Donald Trump said he spoke to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a move that offers to ease tensions between the two major economies amid a fight over tariffs and New Delhi’s purchases of Russian oil.
Trump said he had a “wonderful” call with the Indian leader and wished him a happy birthday, in a social media post on Tuesday.
“He is doing a tremendous job,” Trump added.

Japan's exports to the US continue to fall, hit by Trump's tariffs Japan’s exports to the United States plummeted 13.8% in August compared to the same month the previous year, marking the fifth straight month of declines, as auto exports were hit by President Donald Trump’s tariffs.
U.S. tariffs on Japanese automobiles and auto parts decreased from 27.5%, the amount Trump initially levied, to 15% this week, but that’s still higher than the original 2.5%.
Wednesday’s data reflect the month of August, when the tariffs were higher.

UK Drops Steel Tariff Goals Despite Trump’s Concession Talk The UK has scaled back its goals of bringing the levies on steel to zero, according to a person familiar with the matter, representing a blow to an industry which has been waiting months for the removal of the 25% levy.
A failure to remove the tariffs will undercut assessments of the state visit, which Prime Minister Keir Starmer hopes will help covert Trump’s interest in Britain and royal pageantry into diplomatic wins.

India steel exports face EU carbon tax hit, US tariffs impact minimal, official says India's steel industry will not see much direct impact from U.S. tariffs, but the European Union's carbon tax will affect steel exports, the country's steel secretary Sandeep Poundrik said at the FT Live Energy Transition Summit India on Wednesday.
Roughly two-thirds of India's steel exports go to Europe, while exports to the U.S. are negligible.

Japan's exports down in August as automakers grapple with US tariffs Japan's exports fell for a fourth straight month in August, government data showed on Wednesday, as elevated U.S. tariffs took a deeper toll on the country's automotive and other manufacturing sectors.
"Japanese automakers are still mostly absorbing the tariff costs by cutting export prices to maintain U.S. sales volumes," said Saisuke Sakai, chief Japan economist at Mizuho Research.
"Coupled with growing uncertainties over the U.S. economy, the tariff impact on Japan's exports and output is set to intensify towards the year-end."

Coffee prices in New York approach all-time high amid tariffs, Brazil weather NEW YORK (Reuters) -Prices for coffee futures traded in the Intercontinental Exchange in New York approached an all-time high on Tuesday as the market continues to climb amid the U.S. tariffs and a dry September in Brazil, which could hurt production.
Arabica coffee futures earlier rose to a session high of $4.24 per pound, a seven-month top and not far from the all-time peak of $4.29 per pound for the most liquid contract hit earlier this year.
Arabica closed down 2% at $4.0935/lb.

US to consider new national security tariffs on auto parts WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Commerce Department said Tuesday it will consider industry requests to impose tariffs on additional imported auto parts in the coming weeks on national security grounds.
In May, Trump imposed 25% auto tariffs on more than $460 billion worth of imports of vehicles and auto parts annually, but has since struck deals to reduce those tariffs on some countries.
The department said Monday domestic producers of automobiles or automobile parts, or any industry association can ask for tariffs on additional parts to be imposed that have national security impacts.
