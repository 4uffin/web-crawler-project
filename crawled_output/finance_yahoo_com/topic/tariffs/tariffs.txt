Organic food prices could soar as US imposes import restrictions and new tariffs on specialty sugar The price of most organic food could jump this fall because of new policies and tariffs on imported organic sugar, frustrating manufacturers who say the actions won't help sugar growers but could put some food companies out of business.
More than 90% of organic sugar used by U.S. manufacturers is imported.
The price of that product increased in August when the Trump administration imposed steep trade tariffs, and will rise even more when high-tier duties on most organic sugar imports take effect Oct. 1.

Automakers have resisted raising car prices because of tariffs. That might not last DETROIT (Reuters) -Automakers have been absorbing billions in added expenses since U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs took effect in April, sparing American car shoppers from sticker shock.
Car prices were supposed to have bolted higher by now, auto executives and analysts  predicted.
That restraint from the automakers has carried into this autumn, as car brands are implementing only modest price increases as they roll out their 2026 model-year lineups.

From Skechers to Foot Locker: Tariff chaos spurs record-high footwear, apparel deals -U.S. President Donald Trump's trade war is helping to push U.S. clothing and footwear acquisitions to all-time highs this year, with some companies merging to help offset tariff costs while others go private to weather the next 3-1/2 years of his presidency outside of the public market, dealmakers say.
Popular sneaker company Skechers announced a $9.42 billion deal in early May to go private days after it pulled its annual earnings forecasts and sent a letter, along with 75 other footwear companies, telling Trump the tariffs were an "existential threat" to the industry.
Sneaker seller Foot Locker, which also signed the letter to Trump, in May accelerated its $2.4 billion sale to Dick's Sporting Goods.

Swiss exports to US drop over a fifth after Trump tariffs ZURICH (Reuters) -Swiss goods exports to the United States dropped by more than a fifth in August, the month in which President Donald Trump imposed 39% tariffs on the country, official data showed on Thursday.
When adjusted for seasonal swings, total Swiss exports were down 1% compared to the previous month in nominal terms, and up 2.4% in real terms, according to the Swiss government.
Trump applied the tariffs on August 7, arguing they were justified by the U.S. trade deficit with Switzerland.

U.S. may ease India tariffs, India's chief economic adviser says The U.S. may soon scrap the penal import tariff on Indian goods and also cut reciprocal tariff to 10-15% from the existing 25%, India's Chief Economist Adviser V. Anantha Nageswaran said on Thursday.
"My personal confidence is that in the next couple of months, if not earlier, we will see a resolution to at least to the extra penal tariff of 25%," Nageswaran said at a event in Kolkata.
"It may also be the case that reciprocal tariff of 25% may also come down to levels, which we were earlier anticipating somewhere between 10% and 15%."

Hyundai Motor to ramp up US output, trims profit margin goal on tariff hit Hyundai Motor said on Thursday it aims to produce more than 80% of the vehicles it sells in the U.S. in America by 2030 in response to U.S. tariff policies, as the South Korean automaker ramps up capacity at its Georgia plant.
The automaker said in a statement it trimmed its 2025 operating profit margin target to 6-7% from a previously announced 7-8%, citing the impact of U.S. tariffs.
Hyundai Motor, which together with affiliate Kia Corp is the world's third-biggest automaker by sales, said its Georgia factory will reach production capacity of 500,000 vehicles a year by 2028, with a mix of hybrid and electric vehicles (EVs).
