A Rate Cut Seems Certain
Forecasters pretty much universally agree
A Rate Cut Seems Certain Forecasters pretty much universally agree that a rate cut is coming this month. Meanwhile, new inflation data is out this week on both the consumer and producer side. Two data points, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Producer Price Index (PPI) are the last economic updates of note before the Federal Reserve meeting on interest rates in the middle of the month. This new data follows the August jobs report that showed a slowdown in the labor market. Last week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.3%, the S&P 500 gained 0.3%, and the Nasdaq was up 1%. So far this year, the Dow is up 7%, the S&P 500 has popped 10%, and the Nasdaq leads with a gain of 12%.
Turning to other data, the Atlanta Fed GDPNow measure calls for GDP of 3.0% in the third quarter. The Cleveland Fed Inflation Nowcast forecasts a 2.9% rate for CPI in September, suggesting higher prices ahead. Mortgage rates ticked down last week, with the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at 6.50%, according to FreddieMac. Gas prices rose three cents to an average of $3.18 per gallon for regular gas.
Looking ahead, the next Federal Reserve interest-rate decision comes on September 17 and odds have jumped to 100% for a cut, with 92% looking for a 25-basis-point cut and 8% expecting a 50-basis-point cut, according to the CME FedWatch rate tool. After that, the next meeting is on October 29, and odds are at 80% for a second cut if the Fed opts for a smaller move at the September meeting.
Taking a deeper dive into performance, U.S. stocks are lagging global stocks. A leading industrialized global stock market index, the ETF EFA, has surged 21% year to date, while the leading emerging market ETF EEM has gained 20%. U.S. growth stocks, with a year-to-date gain of 11% (ETF IWF), have taken the edge over value stocks (ETF IWD), which have booked an advance of 9%. In other asset classes for the year to date, AGG bonds are up 3%, gold is up 40%, crude oil is down 13%, and Bitcoin is up 19%. The U.S. dollar is down 10%, tracking DXY. The VIX Volatility Index is at back at 15, below its historical average of 20. Sector performance continues to reveal a mixed picture halfway through 2025. Communication Services leads all sectors with a 17% gain, followed by Industrials (+15%), Information Technology (+14%), and Utilities (+11%), all outperforming the broader market. Defensive sectors like Energy, (+4%), Consumer Staples (+4%) and Real Estate (+4%) cluster below the S&P 500's average return, while Consumer Discretionary (+2%), and Healthcare (flat) are at the bottom.
