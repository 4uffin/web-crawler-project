The Argus Min Vol Model Portfolio
Uncertainty over President Trump's new tariff policies almost knocked stocks into a bear market earlier this year. While growth stocks suffered the most, value stocks also declined. Even bond prices were lower amid the confusion. Stocks have since recovered and the bull market that began in 2022 remains intact. But inflation is still an issue and the trade war may still be in play. Is a recession in the offing? With all the puts and takes, and ups and downs, is it time for investors to cash in their chips? Argus believes that Min Vol is an all-weather strategy that is timely in any investing climate. Academic literature and, more to the point, returns history, indicate that Min Vol can deliver market-matching returns on an absolute basis and superior returns on a risk-adjusted basis over various time periods.
