Sector Rotation as Inflation Worries Percolate
The U.S. stock market
Sector Rotation as Inflation Worries Percolate The U.S. stock market continued higher through August despite a pair of unsettling inflation reports and signs, some of them anecdotal, that consumers are pulling back on spending (i.e., Las Vegas foot traffic was down 11% year over year in June). Investors have been reassured by a stellar second-quarter 2025 earnings season, but concerns about the jobs economy linger, and the outlook for third-quarter GDP is fungible after the first two quarters were dominated by tariff pre-positioning.
In one sign the market is getting a little more defensive, the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average has done better in August than the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite. At the sector level, July and early-August strength in growth sectors Information Technology and Communication Services has them out in front for the third quarter and now for the year to date. But the AI trade is looking a little crowded, and investors may be inclined to rotate to overlooked areas as the fall gets underway.
Uncertainty Driving the Stock-Market Value Hunt With the third quarter of 2025 more than halfway done, two of traditional leadership sectors -- Information Technology and Consumer Discretionary -- are back in front for the period. As of the 8/18/25 close, Information Technology (IYW) was up 6.2% for 3Q25 to date. Consumer Discretionary is something of a comeback kid; after posting a negative first half, the sector is up by 5.8% in the third quarter. The other growth sector, Communication Services, is up 2.1% as AI fatigue inevitably hits mega-caps Alphabet and Meta. That puts it in fourth place among the 11 sectors for 3Q stock performance. Utilities are in third place for 3Q25 to date, building on first-half strength that has it the third-best sector for the year to date. Utilities have traditionally been a top five sector in periods of declining interest rates; and the wait for the year's first rate cut could be over as soon as September. Utilities have another driver, in that explosive growth in AI data centers is leading to soaring demand for electric power.
One surprising winner is Materials, in fourth place for the quarter with a 3.7% gain. China and the U.S. have extended their uneasy trade truce for another 90 days. Top commodities consumer China is also finding ready buyers for its manufactured goods worldwide as it continues its policy of lessening reliance on American consumers -- a policy in place before tariffs came back into play in the second Trump administration.
In descending order, four sectors -- Financial, Healthcare, Industrial, and Consumer Staples - are up in the 1%-2% range for 3Q25. Energy is fractionally positive for the period, and Real Estate is fractionally negative. Financial is building on year-to-date strength, while Healthcare is trying to rebound after a down first half. For all of 2025 to date, the top five sectors are Information Technology, Communication Services, Utilities, Materials, and Financial. Middling sectors include Consumer Staples, Consumer Discretionary, Real Estate, and Materials. The negative year-to-date sectors are Healthcare and Energy. There is little in the current investing environment to suggest that there will be much change in this marching order when the 2025 trading year ends. 2Q25 Earnings: Double-Digit Growth S&P 500 earnings from continuing operations for 2Q25 have blown conservative expectations out of the water. With big retailers and some tech laggards reporting over the next two weeks, there could be some individual drama to come; but that will not impact the big picture. For the calendar second-quarter period, S&P 500 earnings grew in solid double-digit percentages for a third straight quarter. Neither of the two preceding quarters began with such subdued expectations nor beat expectations so soundly. Prior to earnings season, blended EPS growth estimates for 2Q25 were in the 1%-4% range. We believe analysts were unusually cautious heading into second-quarter earnings season due to tariffs, signs of slowing consumer spending, impacts from immigration enforcement policies, and other factors. Yet the largest corporations are where they are for a reason. They adapted a range of tariff mitigation strategies, carefully assessing just how much of higher goods costs to absorb and how much to pass on. That has enabled them to beat unusually conservative expectations. Strong outperformance against expectations pushed earnings growth to the mid-single-digit to high-single-digit range by late July. Then came the heavy tech hitters such as Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, and Alphabet. Their huge net-income generation pushed earnings growth above 10% by the second week of August.
According to Bloomberg, and with over three-quarters of companies having reported, second-quarter earnings are up 11% year over year from 2Q24. According to FactSet, earnings growth for the quarter to date is 11.8%; that increased by three percentage points in just a week after the AI monoliths weighed in. Early in August, Refinitiv was first to report double-digit second-quarter 2025 earnings growth. Refinitiv now estimates that 2Q25 S&P earnings are up 12.9% year over year.
The three agencies may have different prior-year baselines and varying definitions of what constitutes continuing-operations earnings. As all the S&P 500 companies report, the three agencies' final growth rates tend to dovetail toward one another, as they are doing now.
To date, 80%-82% of companies with positive earnings have reported results above consensus expectations. That compares with a long-run average of 75%. Analyst caution may also be contributing to the magnitude of the beat against consensus expectations. According to FactSet, companies are reporting earnings that are 8.4% above estimates, compared to the 10-year average of 6.9%. Bloomberg has a more conservative take on the magnitude of the earnings beat, calculating that EPS has come in at a still-strong 7% above consensus.
At the sector level, the best earnings growth in 2Q25 is coming from Communication Services, Information Technology, and Financial; earnings for all three have increased in upper-teens percentages. Sectors with more moderate but still positive growth include Industrials, Consumer Discretionary, Real Estate, and Utilities. Healthcare, Consumer Staples, and Materials are all around break-even for EPS growth, while Energy earnings are down in high-teen percentages.
Digging down to the industry level, most of the growth in Communication Services is coming from media (up 22%); telecom services is up in mid-single-digits. In Financial, insurance earnings growth is strongest, perhaps reflecting a quiet claims season; with Hurricane Erin already churning, that may not last. The best growth in Information Technology is coming from semiconductors, followed by software & services and then by technology hardware and equipment; here too all industries are up in double-digits.
Consumer Discretionary, one of the most diverse sectors, shows retailing earnings up over 25% but consumer durable and apparel down over 35%. The decline in Healthcare earnings, according to Bloomberg, is attributable to healthcare equipment and services, where the health insurance giants are struggling. Pharmaceutical and biotech earnings are fractionally higher year over year.
Argus came into 2Q25 earnings season modeling the high-single-digit to low-double-digit earnings that are now being delivered. We are not making any changes to our forecasts for S&P 500 earnings from continuing operations, maintaining $270 for 2025 and $300 for 2026.
Conclusion The Fed seeks to use its policy tools -- mainly changes in the fed funds rate, but also quantitative easing or tightening -- to serve its double mandate of maintaining full employment while keeping inflation around the 2% level. A weak employment environment coupled with resurgent inflation makes the dual mandate difficult to balance. After a very weak three-month stretch for jobs creation (based on revisions), a pair of recent inflation reports added to the Fed's quandary. The All-Items Consumer Price Index (CPI) for July rose 0.2% month over month and 2.7% year over year. The core CPI, however, rose 0.3% monthly and 3.1% annually. The annual change was the highest since February 2024, meaning that a year and a half of progress on inflation has been undone. The less-well-followed Producer Price Index (PPI) was even more unsettling, rising 0.9% monthly (its highest jump since June 2022) and 3.3% annually.
Weak August payrolls and large prior-months jobs revisions increased the likelihood of a fed rate cut in September, with the CME FedWatch tool shooting to a high-80% probability immediately following jobs Friday. The two inflation reports lessened that probability on the CME FedWatch tool, but only slightly. Argus Fixed Income Strategist Kevin Heal continues to believe that the Fed will cut rates twice this year, with a 25-basis-point cut in both September and December.
As of this writing, Fed officials, CEOs, economists, and policy wonks are heading to Jackson Hole, where they will try to discern the Fed's intention from likely opaque commentary from Fed Chairman Powell. The focus of the symposium this year is not rate policy, but 'Labor Markets in Transition: Demographics, Productivity, and Macroeconomic Policy.' At a time of declining native-born growth rates worldwide and intense immigration debates, this focus will add piquancy to an already highly anticipated event. Argus• 30 days ago
