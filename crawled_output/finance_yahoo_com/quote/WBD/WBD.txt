Miran is Trump's 'sock puppet': Sen. Warren on Fed independence Senate lawmakers confirmed Stephen Miran to the Federal Reserve board on Monday, after he was nominated by President Trump. This came ahead of the Federal Reserve's September FOMC meeting, which began on Tuesday. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Ma.) joins Yahoo Finance senior reporter Jennifer Schonberger on Capitol Hill to speak more about maintaining the Fed's independence from the executive branch and Trump's goal of lowering interest rates by stacking the central bank. She also states that the president's suggestion of cutting quarterly earnings reports down to a semi-annual basis as "undermin[ing] transparency." Warren has been critical of Miran's acting role as chair to the White House Council of Economic Advisers under the Trump administration. Also catch StoneX's Jon Hilsenrath and S&P Global Ratings' Paul Gruenwald emphasize the goal of avoiding policy mistakes as the Trump administration works to replace top Fed officials.

Warner Bros. Discovery and Paramount: Suggested Merger Makes Sense, but Timing Would Be Surprising
Warner Bros. Discovery was formed in 2022 through the combination of WarnerMedia and Discovery Communications. In 2026, it intends to split its global networks business from its streaming and studios businesses, forming two separate companies. The streaming business includes HBO Max, which is rapidly increasing its international footprint in addition to its major presence in the US. Studios include industry leaders in both film and television, which produce movies and television series that are monetized in multiple ways, including theatrical release, sales to third parties, and feeding into Warner’s own platforms. Global networks consist of basic cable networks like CNN, TNT, TBS, Discovery, HGTV, and The Food Network. The Discovery+ streaming service will remain part of global networks.

The calming of insider-sentiment signals in the weekly data from Vickers Stock
The calming of insider-sentiment signals in the weekly data from Vickers Stock Research has continued for a second week. The one-week sentiment data from Vickers is neutral for all indices and the eight-week data has improved across the board, albeit with a mixed overall stance. The NYSE Eight-Week Sell/Buy Ratio has improved but is still bearish (for a third week). The Nasdaq Eight-Week Sell/Buy Ratio has improved and remains neutral, having come very close to a bearish crossover but never having actually made it. And the Total (all exchanges) eight-week ratio has slipped back into neutral territory after one week in the bearish zone. As we said last week, all insider-sentiment roads point towards neutral, but any thought of bullish insider sentiment remains off the table currently. Meanwhile, the volume of insider transactions is growing as restrictions on insider trading fade with the end of earnings season. Insider selling outpaced insider buying across all sectors over the past week. The greatest level of selling occurred in the Information Technology sector, with shares valued at $304 million sold by insiders versus $50 million bought. Selling activity was also of note in the Industrial sector, with shares valued at $262 million sold versus $34 million bought, as well as in Consumer Discretionary, Healthcare, and Financials.
This week, analysts at Vickers highlighted insider transactions of interest at The Carlyle Group Inc. (NGS: CG) and Mirion Technologies Inc. (NYSE: MIR).
