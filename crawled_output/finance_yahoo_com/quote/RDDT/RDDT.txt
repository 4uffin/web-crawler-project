Argus Adjusts Sector Ratings
We have reviewed our recommended sector allocations this month, and based on the analysis we have adjusted our current sector Over-Weight, Under-Weight, and Market-Weight recommendations for the calendar fourth quarter of 2025. Our multi-factor model includes a performance ranking system, which assigns points for monthly, quarterly, and YTD sector performance vs. the benchmark S&P 500; current sector P/E vs. 5-year P/E, with points awarded for discount to S&P 500 current vs. 5-year P/E delta; two-year earnings growth, with points awarded for exceeding benchmark average and for EPS acceleration; relative performance to the sector group average; sector conviction, meaning BUY rating percentage per sector vs. total Argus BUY-rating percentage; and PEG ratio, with points awarded or subtracted based on sector PEG ratios below or above the group average. This time, our process led to an upgrade of the Communication Services sector to Over-Weight from Market-Weight. We lowered Consumer Staples to Market-Weight from Over-Weight. For more details, see our Portfolio Selector and Investment Portfolio Guide reports. Our rebalancing process takes place four times a year, early in the months of March, June, September, and December. Our current Over-Weight sectors are Communication Services, Financial, Utilities, and Information Technology. Our current Market-Weight sectors are Consumer Staples, Energy, Healthcare, Industrials, and Materials. Our Under-Weight sector is Consumer Discretionary. The Argus Research Investment Policy Committee suggests that advisors and investors leverage this consistent and comprehensive process to adjust sector weightings within their diversified equity portfolios, with a primary focus on the largest sectors.
