Argus Quick Note: Weekly Stock List for 08/18/2025: 13Fs Show Big Guns Buying Big Tech
Large institutional investors are buying tech companies. The stock market volatility during 2Q gave institutional investors a chance to buy dips and pick up some tech names at better prices. Taking a look at 13F filings of well-known institutional portfolios, we see that the big guns were busy picking up some new companies and/or adding to existing positions. Buying was across a variety of sectors, but tech names stand out. Vickers Stock Research, a subsidiary of Argus Research Group, analyzes insider trading and institutional stock ownership. Form 13-Fs, which institutions must file to report their holdings, are due 45 days after the end of calendar quarters and have come in for 2Q25. We review 13Fs of major institutional investors, including activists, to see what they are buying and to look for trends. Based on data from Vickers, here are select purchases made in 2Q by some high-profile money managers. The ratings listed are from Argus Research.

AMD: Maintain $155 Fair Value as US Will Get a Piece of the Action on AI Chips Sold Into China
Advanced Micro Devices designs a variety of digital semiconductors for markets such as PCs, gaming consoles, data centers, industrial, and automotive applications. AMD’s traditional strength was in central processing units and graphics processing units used in PCs and data centers. Additionally, the firm supplies the chips found in prominent game consoles such as the Sony PlayStation and Microsoft Xbox. In 2022, the firm acquired field-programmable gate array leader Xilinx to diversify its business and augment its opportunities in key end markets such as data center and automotive.

Raising 12-month target price to $200
Advanced Micro Devices is the number two player in x86-based microprocessors, behind Intel, and, with the 2008 acquisition of ATI, a top player in graphic processors. It now competes with Nvidia in the GPU processor space for AI applications. In 2021, Advanced Micro Devices acquired Xilinx, expanding its presence in embedded computing and data center. In 2025, AMD acquired ZT systems, which provides AI and general purpose infrastructure for the global hyperscale providers.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500, and the Nasdaq Composite are
The Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500, and the Nasdaq Composite are all higher at midday on Wednesday, this despite some not-so-great earnings reports from some big names and news that President Trump has raised tariffs on India to 50% (25% previous and 25% new). Perhaps traders are starting to become numb to the swirling trade-war headlines. On the earnings front, names like Advanced Micro Devices, Snap, Super Micro Computer, and Disney are among the companies to disappoint. On the flipside, names like Shopify and McDonald's are making shareholders happy today. When all is said and done, big moves are in vogue these days. Indeed, seven stocks in the S&P 500 shot up between 4% and 16% on Tuesday, while 14 fell between 5% and 28%.
