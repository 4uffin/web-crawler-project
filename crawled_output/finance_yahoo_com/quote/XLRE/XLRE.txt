Options In Sovereign Debt Yields
The benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury bond yield is back near 4.0%, up from 3.6% last fall but still below the current cycle highs near 5.0% in October 2023. Interest rates have risen in part due to President Trump's tariff and trade war rhetoric, but have come down in recent weeks as the domestic employment environment has cooled. Sovereign fund investors around the world see less of a need to prop up U.S. Treasury prices if the country is going to be purchasing less of the goods they produce. Other sovereign rates generally have headed in the same direction, with UK's benchmark yield near 4.5%, up from 3.9% last summer, and the debt of Australia, which we view as a proxy for China growth, at 4.3%. But not all have climbed to heights. For example, sovereign debt yields for Japan and Switzerland remain near their pandemic lows at sub-1.5% levels, and China has maintained its interest rate near or below 2.0% as well.
Elsewhere around the globe, tariff worries in Mexico and political uncertainty in Brazil are keeping sovereign debt interest rates near 10%. Russian debt yields are close to 14%, up 100 basis points from a year ago, as the conflict with Ukraine drags on and inflation runs at a 9.0% rate. Looking ahead, as U.S. inflation once again starts to moderate, the Federal Reserve is expected to follow the lead of the European Central Bank, as well as the banks of England and Canada, and resume its strategy of lowering short-term interest rates in order to keep the U.S. economy growing. Should that occur, and tax cuts kick in, longer term U.S. Treasury yields may stay in the 4.0%-5.0% range as the domestic economy continues to grow. That's not a bad return, with inflation moderating.

ASML Earnings: Reset of Expectations Sends Shares Lower; Trim Fair Value Estimate to EUR 820
ASML is the leader in photolithography systems used in manufacturing semiconductors. Photolithography is the process in which a light source is used to expose circuit patterns from a photo mask onto a semiconductor wafer. The latest technological advances in this segment allow chipmakers to continually increase the number of transistors on the same area of silicon, with lithography historically representing a high portion of the cost of making cutting-edge chips. ASML outsources the manufacturing of most of its parts, acting like an assembler. ASML’s main clients are TSMC, Samsung, and Intel.

Most US Banks Won't Benefit Directly From Enhanced Supplemental Leverage Ratio Changes
Goldman Sachs is a storied financial institution, founded in 1869 and best known for its role as a leading global investment bank. The firm has a sprawling reach across global financial centers and has been the leading provider of global merger and acquisition advisory services, by revenue, for the past 20 years. Since the global financial crisis, Goldman has expanded its offerings into more stable fee-based businesses like asset and wealth management, which comprised roughly 30% of post-provision revenue at the end of 2024. The bank holding company generates revenue from investment banking, global market making and trading, lending, asset management, wealth management, and a small and declining portfolio of consumer credit card loans.

Barrick Earnings: Elevated Gold Prices Again a Tailwind
Based in Toronto, Barrick Gold is one of the world's largest gold miners. In 2024, the firm produced nearly 3.9 million attributable ounces of gold and about 430 million pounds of copper. At year-end 2024, Barrick had about two decades of gold reserves along with significant copper reserves. After buying Randgold in 2019 and combining its Nevada mines in a joint venture with competitor Newmont later that year, it operates mines in 19 countries in the Americas, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. The company also has growing copper exposure. Its potential Reko Diq project in Pakistan, if developed, could double copper production by the end of the decade.
