The S&P 500 and S&P 100 posted minor all-time highs last week, while the Nasdaq and the Nasdaq 100 got very close.
The S&P 500 and S&P 100 posted minor all-time highs last week, while the Nasdaq and the Nasdaq 100 got very close. Yet the overall market still seems a bit shaky. The advancing days mostly have been small, and there have been a number of nasty downside days. The weaker days also have occurred on heavy or rising volume, a subtle sign of institutional distribution. The declining days mostly have been led by the Information Technology sector, which currently makes up about 42% of the S&P 500 (including IT stocks in the Communication Services sector, such as META and GOOGL). And despite hitting/almost hitting all-time highs, the major indices haven't gone anywhere since their intraday peaks on July 31.
The big economic news for this shortened first week of September is Friday's August jobs report. There also are a number of Federal Reserve speakers over the next four days. In addition, we have some important technology earnings reports this week, including ZS on Tuesday; CRM, CRDO, and HPE on Wednesday; and AVGO and CIEN on Thursday.
The big winners last week were mostly from Consumer Discretionary (gambling, footwear, and recreational services), Information Technology (software and computer hardware), Energy (exploration and production and integrated oil and gas), Materials (gold mining and specialty chemicals), and Financial (banks and consumer finance). On the downside were Consumer Staples (soft drinks and food products), Healthcare (pharmaceuticals, medical supplies, medical equipment, and biotech), and Industrials (building materials, railroad, and trucking).

Stock indices are lower at midday on Friday. The consumer sentiment survey
Stock indices are lower at midday on Friday. The consumer sentiment survey from the University of Michigan showed that expectations from consumers about inflation increasing one year from now are on the rise. Meanwhile, the PCE report that came out this morning indicated that price increases held steady month over month, while the core PCE report indicated that prices rose at the fastest pace since early 2025.

Was there a potential character change in the stock market on Monday?
Was there a potential character change in the stock market on Monday? Stock futures were higher on news about the U.S. trade deal with the EU. But by the time the market opened, those gains had been cut down to size. And by the end of the day, stocks were pretty much flat. So what is the answer to our above question? We don't have enough evidence based on a slightly negative reaction to seemingly good new. In addition, the market is facing many important data points over the rest of the week, so anxiety is sure to be a little heightened -- especially with the market so stretched from early April.
Currently, one of the most frustrating markets is in the world of crypto. After hitting an intraday high of $123,220 on July 14, Bitcoin has gone sideways over the past 14 days, trading between $114,756 and $121,000. It has formed a small bullish wedge and bull flag and looked like it might either break out or break down a number of times. During the crypto currencies strong advance and last intermediate-term advance (in April and May 2025), price traced out three bullish flags that all lasted about 10 days. But not this time, as the waiting for this latest bull flag continues.
Most of the other markets we follow have been surprisingly quiet in recent months (other than the continued strength in silver). Gold has gone nowhere in over three months, the 10-year Treasury yield is at the same level it was in September 2023, and crude oil (WTI) is at the same level it was going back to March 2023.
