Yellow Metal in Demand
When global economic conditions become uncertain or unpredictable, investors tend to flock to gold. According to Comex, the yellow metal currently is trading at around $3,380 per ounce, up about 30% for the year and near the high end of its five-year range of $1,660-$3,410. Essentially, gold has been on an upward arc since the start of the pandemic. Back in 2019, gold was fetching about $1,200 per ounce. That changed quickly during the first phase of the unanticipated global health crisis: the spot price for an ounce of gold jumped 33% in six months and broke through the $2,000 level. Gold prices next spiked in 2022 due to the war in Ukraine and, over the past year, gold has jumped another 40%, driven by geopolitical developments as well as global uncertainty over tariffs and trade wars. The current price of gold reflects the perceived safety of hard assets amid global conflicts, as well as expectations for lower U.S. interest rates, which tend to weaken the dollar (the currency in which gold is priced). The outlook for Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts also helps gold, as lower rates reduce the risk for a global economic recession and thus a potential decline in gold purchased for jewelry. Our forecast trading range for gold in 2025 is $2,500-$3,500 and our average price forecast for the year is now $3,200. This compares to average gold prices of $2,450 in 2024; $1,960 in 2023; $1,873 in 2022; $1,806 in 2021; $1,781 in 2020; $1,400 in 2019; $1,265 in 2018; $1,277 in 2017; $1,258 in 2016; and $1,155 in 2015. As long as geopolitics are flaring and the global economy is wobbling, the price of gold seems likely to remain at elevated levels.
