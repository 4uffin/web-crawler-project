The Argus Min Vol Model Portfolio
Uncertainty over President Trump's new tariff policies almost knocked stocks into a bear market earlier this year. While growth stocks suffered the most, value stocks also declined. Even bond prices were lower amid the confusion. Stocks have since recovered and the bull market that began in 2022 remains intact. But inflation is still an issue and the trade war may still be in play. Is a recession in the offing? With all the puts and takes, and ups and downs, is it time for investors to cash in their chips? Argus believes that Min Vol is an all-weather strategy that is timely in any investing climate. Academic literature and, more to the point, returns history, indicate that Min Vol can deliver market-matching returns on an absolute basis and superior returns on a risk-adjusted basis over various time periods.

Previewing Friday's Jobs Report
On Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) will report July payrolls. That most important economic indicator is even more important this month. On Wall Street, it will inform (or perhaps inflame) the debate on interest rates and whatever policy decision the Federal Open Market Committee announces this coming Wednesday. On Main Street, the jobs report comes during the back-to-school shopping season, one of the most important indicators of consumer spending power ahead of the even-bigger, trillion-dollar holiday season. We expect July nonfarm payrolls to increase by 112,000. The consensus is about 105,000. The three-month average is 150,000. Our estimate is for a steady unemployment rate of 4.1%. The consensus is 4.2%. We expect that average hours worked and growth in average hourly earnings ticked up to 34.3 hours and to 3.8%, respectively. Low unemployment and continuing wage growth should make it a happy (and profitable) holiday and support our above-consensus 4Q25 estimates for personal consumption to rise 1.7% and GDP to rise 1.9%. If unemployment holds at 4.1% for the next 12 months (a lot to ask), monthly payrolls should average 113,500 according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta's jobs calculator. If unemployment rises to the Fed's projection of 4.5%, payrolls might average about 58,000. To determine the likely outcome, we are watching jobless claims. New claims suggest that layoffs are relatively low, but continuing claims over 2 million say that hiring is slow and jobs have become harder to get. The latter interpretation has been supported by a narrowing "differential" between assessments that jobs are "plentiful" versus "hard to get" in the Conference Board's consumer confidence survey. The July confidence report will be released tomorrow. We expect the headline index to improve by two points to 95. Businesses are telling the Fed they may postpone both layoffs and hiring until economic and policy uncertainty diminish according to the Fed's Summary of Commentary on Economic Conditions, also known as the Beige Book.
