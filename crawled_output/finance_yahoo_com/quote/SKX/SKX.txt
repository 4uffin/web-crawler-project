At a time when a single event (an earnings report, a speech by the Fed chair, a jobs number, or news on tariffs) can send markets flying or diving in a single session, corporate insiders have taken cover in neutral land. The insider-sentiment data from Vickers Stock Research this week is almost as neutral as possible. On a scale where any reading between 2.00 and 6.00 is neutral and any reading above 6.00 is bearish, only the NYSE Eight-Week Sell/Buy Ratio is outside of neutral at 6.34 (and even it has improved from 7.06 two weeks ago). So all is quiet on the insider front. Insider buying activity outpaced insider selling in the Energy sector over the past week, as shares valued at $37 million were bought by insiders versus $1.4 million sold. Meanwhile, the greatest level of selling occurred in Healthcare, with shares valued at $365 million sold versus $68 million bought.
This week, analysts at Vickers highlighted insider transactions of interest at Cardinal Health Inc. (NYSE: CAH) and Energy Transfer LP (NYSE: ET).

Stocks are mixed at midday. Maybe the calm before the storm. This is a big week for earnings with four of the Mag7 reporting. The economic calendar is jam-packed with key data coming on jobs, inflation, and GDP. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note is 4.23%. Oil is down 1.7% at $62 per barrel. Gold is up 1%.
