Many investors seem confused (and for good reason) about what the Federal Open
Many investors seem confused (and for good reason) about what the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will do after their expected 25-basis-point cut on September 17. Will it be 'one and done' or is this the start of a series of rate cuts going out into 2026?
Based on history, it seems odd to us (and apparently others) that the FOMC might be cutting rates with the major stock indices at record highs. But currently, the stock market and the economy have become almost two separate forces, with the mega-caps storming higher due to the AI explosion, while the real economy is just muddling along. There is a massive disconnect between the performance of the major indices and the nation's GDP. That has many investors scratching their heads.
Trading volume of late has been very slow, as we are firmly in the 'dog days of summer.' Looking ahead, we note that September historically is the worst month of the year for stocks. Many are expecting a jump in volatility and a pullback in stocks. But maybe share prices will just keep pushing higher. We admit that we don't have a firm technical grasp on what stocks will do in the near-term -- but leaving it up to seasonals is just not enough.
