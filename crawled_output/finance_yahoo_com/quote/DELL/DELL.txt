How is Labor Holding Up?
This week, the focus flips back to the labor market
How is Labor Holding Up? This week, the focus flips back to the labor market as the May jobs report is due out on Friday. Last week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.6%, the Nasdaq popped 1.9%, and the S&P 500 rose 2.0%. So far this year, the Dow and the Nasdaq are down 1%, while the S&P has gained 0.5%. Earnings season is near an end, but a few big names do report this week. The list of includes on Campbell's on Monday; CrowdStrike and Dollar General on Tuesday; MongoDB and Dollar Tree on Wednesday; Broadcom, Cracker Barrel, and Lululemon on Thursday. Some 98% of S&P 500 companies have reported so far, and earnings for 1Q are up 14% from the prior-year quarter. That is far above the pre-reporting consensus that called for EPS growth of 3%-8% and follows 17% growth in 4Q24 EPS and 9% growth in 3Q24, according to LSEG. For 1Q, Healthcare was the leading sector, up 46%, and Energy was at the bottom, down 17%. On the economic calendar, Job Openings and Factory Orders are reported on Tuesday. On Wednesday, the ADP Private Payrolls report is due. On Thursday, the U.S. Trade Deficit will be updated, and on Friday, the May employment report will be released. In addition, many Federal Reserve officials speak this week, including Chairman Powell, who speaks Monday afternoon at the Fed's International Finance Division's conference in Washington, DC. The Economic Call of the Week from Argus' Chief Economist Chris Graja, CFA, is for another healthy employment report on Friday. We expect to see that Nonfarm Payrolls increased by 140,000 and the Unemployment Rate remained at 4.2%. The consensus is 130,000 for payrolls and 4.2% for unemployment. Despite a solid forecast for May and a baseline forecast for U.S. economic growth to slow from 2024 (but avoid recession), Chris is dusting off his spreadsheet for the Sahm Rule recession indicator. Layoff announcements have been increasing, according to the Challenger Report, and the pace of hiring has slowed, according to the JOLTS report. The Sahm indicator rang a false alarm last year. We have never used it as a standalone recession indicator, but it is still one of the employment-driven business cycle indicators we follow. The rule states that when the three-month moving average of the Unemployment Rate rises 0.5 percentage points or more above its low over the prior 12 months, the U.S. economy is in the early months of recession. If the Unemployment Rate for May comes in at 4.2%, as we expect, the Sahm indicator would be 0.27 by our calculation, which is well below the warning level of 0.5. What would it take to spark a recession warning? If the Unemployment Rate rose by 0.10 a month starting in June, our model shows that we would get a warning sign of 0.53 in October. This is an analytical scenario, not a forecast. If the Unemployment rate rose by 0.10 a month through August and then rose 0.20 to 4.7% in September, our calculations show that the indicator would be at 0.47, just below the threshold. In that scenario, our numbers show that the indicator would give a recession warning in October.
Turning to other data, the Atlanta Fed GDPNow measure forecasts 3.8% for 2Q and follows a decline of 0.3% for 1Q. The Cleveland Fed Inflation Nowcast forecasts a 2.4% CPI rate for May. Mortgage rates inched higher again last week, with the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at 6.89%, according to FreddieMac. Gas prices ticked down a penny to an average of $3.16 per gallon for regular gas.
The next Fed rate decision is on June 18, with odds at 5% for a rate cut, according to the CME FedWatch rate tool. After that, the Fed next meets on July 30, with odds for a rate cut at 27%.
