Bank of America Earnings: Loan Growth Powers Solid Quarter; Raising Fair Value Estimate
Bank of America is one of the largest financial institutions in the United States, with more than $3.2 trillion in assets. It is organized into four major segments: consumer banking, global wealth and investment management, global banking, and global markets. Bank of America's consumer-facing lines of business include its network of branches and deposit-gathering operations, retail lending products, credit and debit cards, and small-business services. The company's Merrill Lynch operations provide brokerage and wealth-management services, as does its private bank. Wholesale lines of business include investment banking, corporate and commercial real estate lending, and capital markets operations. Bank of America has operations in several countries but is primarily US-focused.

Morningstar• last month
Raising target following better-than-expected 2Q EPS
Bank of America is one of the largest financial companies in the world. The company is primarily a U.S. retail and commercial bank, with a network of more than 4,000 branches across much of the country. The 2005 acquisition of MBNA made Bank of America the nation's largest credit-card lender. As such, trends in consumer interest rates, employment, income growth, and borrowing patterns represent a significant risk to the company's earnings. The 2008 acquisition of Countrywide made BofA the country's largest mortgage company as well. BofA became a top-tier securities firm and retail broker with the acquisition of Merrill Lynch.

Stocks are mixed at Wednesday midday. More big banks are reporting earnings
Stocks are mixed at Wednesday midday. More big banks are reporting earnings and the news is good. Wholesale inflation indicator PPI came in muted. However, dragging on the market is yesterday's inflation report which showed consumer prices on the rise. This does not bode well for interest rate cuts. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note is 4.45%. Crude oil is near $66.
