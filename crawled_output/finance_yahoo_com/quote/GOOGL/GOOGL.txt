Good Year for Global Stocks
We have three strategic asset-allocation models based on risk-tolerance: Conservative, Growth, and Aggressive. We make tactical adjustments to the models, based on our outlooks for the various segments of the capital markets. In terms of performance year to date, stocks and bonds are close, with stocks pulling a few hundred basis points ahead through August. From an asset-allocation standpoint, our model still slightly favors bonds over stocks for long-term portfolio positioning. We are over-weight on large-caps at this stage of the market cycle. We favor them for growth exposure and financial strength, as well as exposure to the IT sector. Our recommended exposure to small- and mid-caps is 5%-10% of equity allocation, below the benchmark weighting. The dearth of IPOs has meant a lack of exciting new companies in the marketplace. While the top tier of stocks (the Mag 7) soared on enthusiasm for AI, legacy small companies haven't been able to innovate to the same degree. One of the surprises this year has been the performance of global stocks, with an impressive performance lead in 2025. We expect the long-term trend favoring U.S. stocks to re-emerge, given volatile global economic, political, geopolitical, and currency conditions. That said, international stocks offer favorable near-term valuations and we target 15%-20% of equity exposure to the group. In terms of growth and value, growth rebounded in 2023-2024 and outperformed value as interest rates stabilized and started lower, though value was off to a good start in 2025. Key value sectors that may be less exposed to global trade wars include Consumer Staples, Healthcare, Utilities, and Financial (via regional banks).

Large Cap US Pick List - September 2025
This pick list highlights constituents of the Morningstar US Large Cap Index that we believe offer investors the best risk-adjusted return prospects. Stocks of large-cap companies where neither growth nor value characteristics predominate. Stocks in the top 70% of the capitalization of the U.S. equity market are defined as large cap.

Raising target to $265
Alphabet, formerly called Google, maintains the largest online index of websites accessible through automated search technology. It generates revenue through online advertising, cloud services, and hardware. Google is now an operating segment of Alphabet. The company was founded in 1998 by Sergey Brin and Larry Page and went public in 2004.
Google's AdWords is an auction-based program that lets businesses display ads along with particular search results. Google's AdSense program enables websites in the company's network to serve targeted ads, based on search terms or web content, from AdWords advertisers. Most of the revenue generated through AdSense is shared with network partners. In addition, Alphabet owns YouTube.com, the web-based video site. It has also expanded into mobile telephony with its Android smartphone operating system and into public cloud services. About 52% of Alphabet's revenue is generated outside the U.S.
On April 3, 2014, Alphabet's new nonvoting class C shares began trading under the ticker GOOG. Alphabet's publicly held class A shares switched to the ticker GOOGL. The effect of the new class C share issuance was a non-economic 2-for-1 stock split.
On July 15, 2022, Alphabet executed a 20-for-1 stock split on its Class A, Class B and Class C stock. The stock split had no impact on the economic value of GOOGL shares.
Our rating on the Information Technology sector is Over-Weight. Consumer electronics demand, which was reduced by inflation, is now showing signs of recovery. IT demand in enterprise and data center markets weakened after consumer demand but now also shows signs of recovery, fueled by mounting interest in generative AI.

Stocks are higher at Thursday midday. It is a heavy news day. President
Stocks are higher at Thursday midday. It is a heavy news day. President Trump's nominee for the Federal Reserve is at the Senate undergoing a confirmation hearing. The U.S. Trade Deficit increased in July due to a rush to buy foreign imports before tariffs kicked in. The ADP private payrolls report came in weaker than expected. Wall Street is eager to see the numbers tomorrow when the August Jobs report is released. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note is 4.19%. Crude oil is at $63 per barrel.
