On September 9, the S&P 500, S&P 100, Invesco S&P 500 Top 50 ETF (XLG), Nasdaq,
On September 9, the S&P 500, S&P 100, Invesco S&P 500 Top 50 ETF (XLG), Nasdaq, and Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) all hit all-time highs, albeit very minor new highs. In a recent technical commentary, we wrote that since the start of August, the S&P 500 and S&P 100 were possibly working to emerge from a somewhat rare formation known as a rising consolidation. These bullish patters are seen after strong multi-month rallies and when many are looking for a technical pullback (like us). We noted that the recent pause was tight, with a minor slope to the upside - and said that we were looking for some follow-through to the upside as confirmation of the pattern.
The above is still the case, and now we can add the Nasdaq, Nasdaq 100 and the XLG to the list. Sometimes the break higher out of these formations can be sharp. While big short-term gains are always enjoyable, they can lead to parabolic, blow-off moves that have little staying power. So, the question is as follows. Do you want your gains in two weeks or spread out over two months? Despite the powerful move since late 2022, certain breadth measures are not showing the consistent strength we typically see. Some 61% of S&P 100 stocks are above their 200-day average, down from a peak of 85% in December 2023. Those above their 50-day have fallen to 44%. On the positive side, the advance-decline (AD) line for the index is very close to an all-time high, and the AD line for volume also is near an all-time high.

Inflation Surprise
Two inflation reports (the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Producer Price Index (PPI)) were released this week and their messages diverged. Pricing pressures remained relatively benign in the consumer economy, while prices surged farther up the supply chain. The CPI news was generally positive, as the month-to-month headline number increased only two-tenths of a percent from the previous month; the annualized rate was 2.7%, steady month to month. The core inflation rate (ex-food and energy) rose three-tenths of a percent month to month, and ticked higher to an annual rate of 3.1%. The wild cards in this report have been Transportation Services and Shelter costs, which were both up around 3.5% year over year. Those rates are keeping CPI above the Fed's 2.0% target. Meanwhile, the PPI measures pricing trends at the manufacturing level. Here, the news was a bit alarming. The PPI final demand monthly rate in July was 0.9%, the highest monthly change in three years. The annualized change in final demand rate was 3.3%, up from 2.4% a month ago. It is not a certainty that this one data point in the PPI is an inflection point or the start of an alarming trend.
Nothing else in the PPI report indicated that prices were spiralling out of control. As such, we continue to expect pricing pressures to ease into 2026 as the housing market cools due to high mortgage rates and the price of oil stays below $90 per barrel (current price around $64). But that low price of oil reflects a new wild card that has entered the forecasting picture: President Trump's trade wars. His tariffs, should they ever go into full effect, will almost certainly raise prices. That will put new pressure on the Fed, which we think (based on the fundamentals) should be in position to lower rates two times by the end of the year.
