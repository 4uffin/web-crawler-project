Utilities, nuclear stocks to benefit from lower rates. Here's how. US and UK officials signed a new nuclear energy agreement, titled the Atlantic Partnership for Advanced Nuclear Energy, that could streamline companies' building of new power stations across both regions. Jefferies managing director of US power, utilities, and clean energy research Paul Zimbardo illustrates the growth potential this could mean for utilities and nuclear power outside of AI use cases, namely his latest pick in Entergy (ETR). Also catch ClearView Energy Partners' Timothy Fox explain why the Nuclear Renaissance may have more momentum than ever before now.
