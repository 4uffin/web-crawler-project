Argus Quick Note: Weekly Stock List for 08/25/2025: Innovators in the Financial Sector
The Financial sector is active, with new business models, a heavy embrace of AI, small companies entering with innovative niches, and established players reworking divisions to be more competitive. It includes many companies that offer growth and value and that we believe should be included in diversified portfolios. Currently, we have an Over-Weight rating on the sector, which has great depth at about 14% of the S&P 500. At that size, there is a large pool of stocks from which to choose. The current landscape of the sector includes new fintech companies, many with profitability models prioritizing fees overs basis-point spreads. Many are focused on growth as opposed to balance sheets and dividends. Innovators include companies coming up with new payment-processing platforms, new insurance services, new ways to bank and complete financial transactions, and new ways to leverage AI. At a quick glance, the industry is using AI for financial planning, underwriting, trading, and fraud protection. In trading, AI algorithms analyze large sums of data and historical trends in order to recognize patterns and movements in the financial markets. The following is a list of BUY-rated Financial sector stocks that we consider to be innovators. We also note which are included in Argus theme model portfolios.

At midday Wednesday, the major benchmarks were mostly lower, with the Nasdaq
At midday Wednesday, the major benchmarks were mostly lower, with the Nasdaq Composite, the market's recent winner, down by far the most. Investors will parse potentially market-moving news in the form of minutes from the Fed's July open market committee meeting at 2pm that will show member thinking on future interest rates. That will be followed by highly anticipated comments from Fed Chairman Powell on Thursday. Retailers have moved into the thick of their earnings season, offering insight into the state of the U.S. consumer, with today's crop of reporting companies showing mixed consumer behavior.

Argus Quick Note: Weekly Stock List for 08/04/2025: New Stocks In Our Universe of Coverage
The Argus coverage list is growing, with exciting new companies being added. We are selective, choosing companies that we believe demonstrate growth, innovation, and strong investment potential. As such, most new stocks are rated BUY, but occasionally there is a HOLD-rated new company if we see potential. The Argus Research Fundamental Universe of Coverage includes over 500 leading U.S. and international companies. We cover the waterfront -- from Technology to Utilities from Energy to Healthcare. Generally, we follow the top 200 most widely held stocks, a list we source from our sister company Vickers Stock Research, which collects institutional ownership data from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. From there, we look to identify the next 200-300 emerging U.S. and international companies to fill out our list. Our Universe of Coverage is dynamic and growing. We are continually adding stocks and often get great ideas from our clients (use https://www.argusresearch.com/ContactUs.aspx if you'd like to send us your ideas). Here are some of the additions we have made so far in 2025.
