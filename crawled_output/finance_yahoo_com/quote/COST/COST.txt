Checking Our List for Holiday Sales
We expect holiday retail sales to rise about 3.75% this year, topping $1 trillion for the first time. Christmas is more than four months away, but our experience is that employed U.S. consumers go out of their way make the season special. We believe low unemployment at 4.2% and the potential for the Fed to cut rates twice before the end of the year are catalysts for a happy holiday. The average holiday sales gain since 2002 has been 4%, with a 4.2% increase last year and a high of 12% in the pandemic-recovery year of 2021. The only decline, of 4.7%, came with the economy in a recession in 2008. We calculate holiday sales in the same manner as the National Retail Federation (NRF) does, based on the year-over-year change in the Commerce Department's retail sales data for the combined months of November and December. Like the NRF, we exclude sales at gas stations, car dealers, and restaurants, focusing on core retail. There are three categories that represent more than two-thirds of holiday-season sales and drive our forecast: grocery stores, general merchandise stores, and e-commerce. Our forecasts for those categories are up 2.5%, up 2.5%, and up 6.5%, respectively. The retail sales figures are reported on a nominal basis. If inflation is running warm, sales could exceed these estimates if shoppers stick to their lists and pay higher prices. We do not see excessive holiday inflation. We believe many retailers bought key items early to avoid tariffs. And the holidays are always competitive and promotional. Shoppers may adjust by pulling back on self-gifting and we could see a spending hangover in January as shoppers pay credit card balances. Within our sales forecast, e-commerce is the biggest category, representing more than 30% of holiday sales. Last year, it grew 8.6% -- aided by a 50-basis-point rate cut and some post-election optimism. The category has averaged 7% year-over-year growth over the last three months. We believe 6.5% is a reasonable against a tough comparison and the chance that some shoppers are starting early.

The Argus Dividend Growth Model Portfolio
Dividend income is often overlooked amid gyrations in the stock market. Consider that in 2024, market bulls were boasting about 24%-plus S&P 500 returns. No one was very focused on the broad market index's 1.2% dividend yield. But dividends are an important element of return, and 2025 is bearing that out.
Through May, the S&P 500 was up a thin 1.1%; without dividends, there was essentially no returns at all. Indeed, dividend income accounted for 42% of the total return of the S&P 500 between 1930 and 2012, according to Hartford Funds. And that's just the average. In some of those decades, dividends accounted for more than 50% of total returns and even 100% of returns. More recently, dividends have accounted for a smaller portion of returns, at around 15%-20%. Not for nothing, in 2022, dividend payments softened the blow when most market indices turned bearish as the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates. We saw that pattern in 2018 as well. Not all dividends are created equal, though, and it is important to understand the difference between the two main investment categories: high-yield stocks and dividend-growth stocks.
