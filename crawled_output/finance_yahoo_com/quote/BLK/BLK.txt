Argus Quick Note: Weekly Stock List for 08/25/2025: Innovators in the Financial Sector
The Financial sector is active, with new business models, a heavy embrace of AI, small companies entering with innovative niches, and established players reworking divisions to be more competitive. It includes many companies that offer growth and value and that we believe should be included in diversified portfolios. Currently, we have an Over-Weight rating on the sector, which has great depth at about 14% of the S&P 500. At that size, there is a large pool of stocks from which to choose. The current landscape of the sector includes new fintech companies, many with profitability models prioritizing fees overs basis-point spreads. Many are focused on growth as opposed to balance sheets and dividends. Innovators include companies coming up with new payment-processing platforms, new insurance services, new ways to bank and complete financial transactions, and new ways to leverage AI. At a quick glance, the industry is using AI for financial planning, underwriting, trading, and fraud protection. In trading, AI algorithms analyze large sums of data and historical trends in order to recognize patterns and movements in the financial markets. The following is a list of BUY-rated Financial sector stocks that we consider to be innovators. We also note which are included in Argus theme model portfolios.

Better Equity and Credit Market Conditions Have Lifted BlackRock’s AUM Levels to Record Highs
BlackRock is the largest asset manager in the world, with $12.528 trillion in assets under management at the end of June 2025. Its product mix is diverse, with 54% of managed assets in equity strategies, 25% in fixed income, 8% in multi-asset classes, 8% in money market funds, and 5% in alternatives. Passive strategies account for two-thirds of long-term AUM, with the company's ETF platform maintaining a leading market share domestically and on a global basis. Product distribution is weighted more toward institutional clients, which, by our calculations, account for around 80% of AUM. BlackRock is geographically diverse, with clients in more than 100 countries and more than one-third of managed assets coming from investors domiciled outside the US and Canada.
