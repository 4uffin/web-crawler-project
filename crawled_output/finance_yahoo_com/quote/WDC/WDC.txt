Cloud momentum, raising target price
Western Digital produces DRAM-based hard disk drives (HDDs). WDC's products are used in cloud and on-premises data centers, desktop & notebook PCs, enterprise storage, video surveillance, networking products, DVRs, point-of-sale devices, and set-top boxes. In May 2016, WDC acquired NAND flash leader SanDisk. In October 2023, WDC announced plans to unwind that acquisition and spin off the NAND flash business. That deal was concluded in February 2025, returning WDC to a pure-play HDD manufacturer.

Western Digital Earnings: Strong Results as Cloud Demand Accelerates; Raising Fair Value Estimate
Western Digital is a leading vertically integrated supplier of hard disk drives. The HDD market is a practical duopoly, with Western Digital and Seagate being the two largest players. Western Digital designs and manufactures its HDDs, with much of the manufacturing and workforce located in Asia. The primary consumers of HDDs are data centers.
