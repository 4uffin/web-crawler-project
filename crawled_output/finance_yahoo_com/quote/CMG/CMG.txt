Chipotle Is Poised for Long-Term Outperformance on Strong Unit Economics and Digital Prowess
Chipotle Mexican Grill is the largest fast-casual chain restaurant in the United States, with systemwide sales of $11.3 billion in 2024. The Mexican concept is almost exclusively company-owned, with just three license stores operated through a master franchise relationship with Alshaya Group in the Middle East. It had a footprint of 3,726 stores at the end of 2024, heavily indexed to the United States, although it maintains a small presence in Canada, the UK, France, and Germany. Chipotle sells burritos, burrito bowls, tacos, quesadillas, and beverages, with a selling proposition built around competitive prices, high-quality food sourcing, speed of service, and convenience. The company generates its revenue entirely from restaurant sales and delivery fees.

Lowering EPS estimates; reduced guidance sends shares lower
Chipotle Mexican Grill opened its first restaurant in 1993, became a subsidiary of McDonald's in 1998, and was spun off in a public offering in 2006. The company operates more than 3,400 restaurants. The restaurants offer quick service but maintain traditional cooking methods and utilize high-quality ingredients. The company has a tightly focused menu, but store design and decor vary by location. The company has been expanding rapidly in recent years as interest in Southwestern food has spread throughout the U.S. With a market capitalization of $71.1 billion, the shares are generally regarded as large-cap growth.
