In fiscal 2025, 81% of its revenue was derived from the United States, although the company also operates in Canada, Europe, Australia, Asia, and Latin America.

The major indices saw a big rally going into earnings season and, generally,
The major indices saw a big rally going into earnings season and, generally, that can be a tough combination as expectations are very high. Sometimes, it's better to go into this period with price weakness as expectations are lower and easier to beat. Remember, it's not the results that matter -- it's the reaction to the numbers and the forecasts.
Stepping back from the minutia is a very good idea for chartists, at least once in a while. As John Heywood said back in the 16th century, 'don't miss the forest for the trees.' Believe it or not, the S&P 500 has been in a mostly-rising rising channel since 2010/2011. Of course, price moved outside the channel lines for a big part of 2021 and cratered through the lower channel for a very short time during the pandemic. The top channel comes in around the 6,400-6,450 region for the S&P 500 when looking out about a month. Will the top trendline act as significant resistance? That we cannot say until after the fact.
There are many ways to measure overbought/oversold readings, and many periods can be examined. Sticking with the longer term, the S&P 500 is 28% above its 200-week exponential average. Since 1980, the '500' went far above 30% in 1986 and 1987, and from 1996 until 2000. The index generally runs out of gas in the 30%-40% range. Again, we do not know how far this bull will take the index above its 200-week exponential moving average, but we are getting close to rarefied air.
