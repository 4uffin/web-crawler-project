Large Cap US Pick List - September 2025
This pick list highlights constituents of the Morningstar US Large Cap Index that we believe offer investors the best risk-adjusted return prospects. Stocks of large-cap companies where neither growth nor value characteristics predominate. Stocks in the top 70% of the capitalization of the U.S. equity market are defined as large cap.
Morningstar• 8 days ago
The Argus High-Yield Model Portfolio
Value stocks -- a market segment that includes high-yield stocks -- outperformed growth stocks in 2022. In early 2025, value stocks once again outperformed growth and remained on top for about six months. That's a recent rarity, as for the past decade-plus, the performance record has favored growth. But the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines gave a lift to some of the cyclical companies (energy and regional banks) that had lagged, and value stocks outpaced growth stocks that year. While growth stocks have retaken the lead since 2023, the Federal Reserve continues to keep interest rates high to fend off inflation. This could possibly cap multiple expansion for growth companies in coming quarters. In any event, the value sector is the place to achieve income.
