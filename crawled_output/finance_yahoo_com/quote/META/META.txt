The SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) ETF remains stuck in a triangle but, once again, is close to breaking out.
The SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) ETF remains stuck in a triangle but, once again, is close to breaking out. In addition, price is less than one point from the closing all-time high from April 21. It has been four months of doing nothing for the yellow metal. We were looking for an actual correction, but gold has hung tough. We thought the U.S. Dollar Index would start a new uptrend after its almost six-month correction, but that has not happened, as the bounce has been disappointing. The Commitment of Traders (COT) data for the dollar remains bullish, which has been very reliable in recent years -- but is not working this time. GLD's daily momentum has broken its multi-month downtrend, a bullish sign. A GLD breakout could lead to a measured move up to the $335-$345 region.
Meanwhile, crude oil (WTI) is trading around $64.30/barrel after consistent weakness since July 30 (from the $70 level). Prices have back-tested a former resistance line (possible support) and may have traced out a wild three-wave ABC pullback off the peak since mid-June. The Vortex Indicator remains bearish while the neutral CTM Trend Meter turned higher recently. The daily moving-average convergence/divergence (MACD) is in negative territory but is trying to turn higher. Once again, momentum strength from back in mid-June has faded hard. The COT data is bullish, and its configuration is similar to back in April, late last year, and early last year. Each time, crude oil rallied. Crude oil sentiment is neutral to bearish. Although a tough call, we are looking for some potential upside in the near- to intermediate-term due to the COT data and the universal "throwing in the towel" by the investment community.

The bears had a chance to turn at least the short-term trend to the downside, but the bulls fought back and the uptrend off the April bottom appears to be on track.
The bears had a chance to turn at least the short-term trend to the downside, but the bulls fought back and the uptrend off the April bottom appears to be on track. We saw some minor sell signals on August 1, but they have been erased. The major indices rallied last week, albeit in choppy fashion, with up days on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and down days on Tuesday and Thursday.
The sell signals and warnings that we had on August 1 included a bearish crossover of the five-day- and 13-day exponential moving averages (EMAs), a break of the 21-day EMA, and the cycling of the Vortex indicator into negative territory. In addition, price volatility picked up following the July 31 bearish reversal, and that can be a bad sign after a big advance. The 21-day rate of change (ROC) got very close to cycling into negative territory before popping last week. We still have two bearish divergences on the daily moving-average convergence/divergence (MACD) after cycling into extreme overbought territory -- a warning, but not a sell signal.
For now, it looks like the major indices could be at the start of another leg higher, with the S&P 500 (SPX) just missing a closing all-time high on Friday and the Nasdaq and Nasdaq 100 reaching closing highs. The Commitment of Traders (COT) data for the SPX remains bullish, but is bearish for the Nasdaq 100. The data for the volatility index (VIX) is bullish, suggesting we could see another move higher and then an eventual pullback in the stock market.
Over the weekend, Ethereum broke out of a base going back to March 2024 and is close to all-time highs, while Bitcoin broke out of a flag on Sunday and also is near to all-time highs. (Mark Arbeter, CMT)
