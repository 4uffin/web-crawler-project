Argus Quick Note: Weekly Stock List for 09/08/2025: Companies Raising Guidance
During the recent earnings season, many companies across many sectors raised guidance. That is admirable, especially during uncertain economic times. We track the companies raising guidance and look for trends. Indeed, Management Signals is one of our Investment Themes for 2025. The sectors with the most companies raising guidance in the past quarter were Communication Services, Healthcare, Industrial, and Information Technology. Sectors underrepresented were Financial, Energy, and Consumer Staples. Raising guidance in the face of tariff and macroeconomic uncertainty could signal strong management, flexibility, and resilience. As well, increased guidance is often a catalyst for market-beating returns in the quarters ahead. The following is a partial list of companies in Argus' Fundamental Universe of Coverage at which management increased its outlook during the recent reporting season, with our rating and the sector designation noted. We like this theme, as it crosses numerous industries and generates a robust list of potential portfolio candidates.
Argus• 10 days ago
Value Sectors
Each month we take a close look at an aspect of sector investing. This month, we are examining growth and valuation. Investors hunting for stocks that reasonably balance long-term growth prospects and current value characteristics might want to look at companies in the Healthcare, Financial and Communication Services sectors. These are among the industry groups that are currently selling for (price/earnings) / (growth+yield) ratios at or below the S&P 500's ratio of 2.1. To generate the PEGY ratios, we use the P/E ratio for each sector based on forward earnings for the numerator. For the denominator, we average the growth rates for the past five years along with two years of forward estimates, this to achieve a smoother, less-volatile, earnings growth rate trend. We then add the current yield, to approximate total return. As an example, the current S&P 500 P/E ratio is 21, the current yield is 1.2%, and the historical growth rate is 9%. The formula is 21/(1.2+9.0) = 2.1.
Sectors with favorable growth and valuation characteristics, in addition to the three listed above, also include Energy and Materials. Premium-valued sectors with low growth rates include the consumer groups.
Based on our analysis of growth rates and valuations, along with other factors, we have established our current Over-Weight sectors as Information Technology, Financial, Utilities, and Consumer Staples. Our Under-Weight sector is Consumer Discretionary. Our Market-Weight sectors include Energy, Communication Services, Healthcare, Materials, Real Estate, and Industrial.
