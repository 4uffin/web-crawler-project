Value Sectors
Each month we take a close look at an aspect of sector investing. This month, we are examining growth and valuation. Investors hunting for stocks that reasonably balance long-term growth prospects and current value characteristics might want to look at companies in the Healthcare, Financial and Communication Services sectors. These are among the industry groups that are currently selling for (price/earnings) / (growth+yield) ratios at or below the S&P 500's ratio of 2.1. To generate the PEGY ratios, we use the P/E ratio for each sector based on forward earnings for the numerator. For the denominator, we average the growth rates for the past five years along with two years of forward estimates, this to achieve a smoother, less-volatile, earnings growth rate trend. We then add the current yield, to approximate total return. As an example, the current S&P 500 P/E ratio is 21, the current yield is 1.2%, and the historical growth rate is 9%. The formula is 21/(1.2+9.0) = 2.1.
Sectors with favorable growth and valuation characteristics, in addition to the three listed above, also include Energy and Materials. Premium-valued sectors with low growth rates include the consumer groups.
Based on our analysis of growth rates and valuations, along with other factors, we have established our current Over-Weight sectors as Information Technology, Financial, Utilities, and Consumer Staples. Our Under-Weight sector is Consumer Discretionary. Our Market-Weight sectors include Energy, Communication Services, Healthcare, Materials, Real Estate, and Industrial.
