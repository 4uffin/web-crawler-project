Darden Restaurants: Value-Led Promotions Elevate Brand Demand, but Shares Remain Overvalued
Darden Restaurants is the largest restaurant operator in the US full-service space, with consolidated revenue of $12.1 billion in fiscal 2025. The company maintains a portfolio of 11 restaurant brands: Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse, Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen, Ruth's Chris, Yard House, The Capital Grille, Seasons 52, Eddie V’s, Bahama Breeze, The Capital Burger, and most recently, Chuy's. Darden generates revenue almost exclusively from company-owned restaurants, though a small network of franchised restaurants and consumer-packaged goods sales through the traditional grocery channel contribute modestly. As of the end of its fiscal 2025, the company operated 2,159 restaurants in the US.

Let the inflation games begin!
Let the inflation games begin! Investors don't seem overly anxious before August's CPI report today and the August PPI report on Thursday, and stocks continue to be bid higher. The S&P 500, S&P 100, Invesco S&P 500 Top 50 ETF (XLG), Nasdaq, and Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) all hit all-time highs on Tuesday, albeit very minor new highs.
In our September 5 technical commentary, we wrote that since the start of August, the S&P 500 and S&P 100 were possibly working to emerge from a somewhat rare formation known as a rising consolidation. These bullish patterns are seen after strong multi-month rallies and when many are looking for a technical pullback (like us). We noted that the recent pause was tight, with a minor slope to the upside - and said that we were looking for some follow-through to the upside as confirmation of the pattern.
The above is still the case, and now we can add the Nasdaq, Nasdaq 100 and the XLG to the list. Sometimes the break higher out of these formations can be sharp. While big short-term gains are always enjoyable, they can lead to parabolic, blow-off moves that have little staying power. So the question is as follows. Do you want your gains in two weeks or spread out over two months?
Despite the powerful move since late 2022, certain breadth measures are not showing the consistent strength we typically see. Some 61% of S&P 100 stocks are above their 200-day average, down from a peak of 85% in December 2023. Those above their 50-day have fallen to 44%. On the positive side, the advance-decline (AD) line for the index is very close to an all-time high, and the AD line for volume also is near an all-time high. (Mark Arbeter, CMT)

Technology and the massive AI trade took it on the chin Tuesday, dragging some of the major indices down as well.
Technology and the massive AI trade took it on the chin Tuesday, dragging some of the major indices down as well. The Nasdaq dropped 1.5% and the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) fell 1.4%, led lower by weakness in the mega-cap semiconductor and software stocks. The iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) lost 1.6%, the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) declined 2%, the Dow Jones U.S. Semiconductor Index gave back 3%, the DJ U.S. Software Index was off 2%, and the iShares Tech-Software ETF (IGV) sank 2.6%.
Many of the beloved IT names were whacked, including NVDA, AVGO, TSM, AMD, ARM, MSFT, ORCL, and PLTR, which all fell 1.4% to 9.4%. The QQQ as well as the SOXX and the SMH closed at or near their 21-day exponential moving averages. The software indices broke below their 50-day averages for the first time since early this year and have broken down from short-term topping formations. In addition, the highflying (mostly IT) IPOs from 2025 have been smacked hard.
On the flipside, five of the 11 S&P 500 sectors rose between 0.6% and 1.8% (mostly defensive areas). Real Estate, Consumer Staples, and Utilities led with gains of 1% to 1.8%, while Healthcare and Materials gained 0.6%.
The QQQ has traced out multiple bearish divergences with respect to the daily moving-average convergence/divergence (MACD) and there has been one divergence with the 14-day relative strength index (RSI). Volume was above average, creating a second distribution day. For big trouble, we need to see four to five days of heavy selling in a 10-day period. The Vortex indicator is close to turning bearish while the 21-day rate-of-change (ROC) is nearing bearish territory. (Mark Arbeter, CMT)

Tuesday was the second day in a row when the weakest stocks on a technical basis posted the biggest gains, while some of the highest-ranked issues took it on the chin.
Tuesday was the second day in a row when the weakest stocks on a technical basis posted the biggest gains, while some of the highest-ranked issues took it on the chin. Low quality is suddenly back in vogue and high quality is getting sold.
Looking at the components of the S&P 100 (OEX), the 20 largest gainers included 10 stocks that are within the lowest 20% for technical ranking. We are using www.stockcharts.com and their proprietary technical ranking (SCTR) to measure strength or weakness. A few more of the biggest daily winners are in the lowest 30% of all issues. About half of the largest winners came from Healthcare and Consumer Staples. Healthcare is the weakest sector in 2025, while both Healthcare and Consumer Staples are the two weakest S&P 500 sectors over the past three months. Out of the 11 weakest stocks in the OEX on Tuesday, eight have SCTRs in the top 20%, most of which were IT stocks, with a couple Industrials thrown in to the mix. Over the past three months, Information Technology has a big lead, with a 35% surge, while Industrials are second, with a gain of 22%.
We are seeing the most damage in the hottest industries, including some of the highflying AI stocks, quantum-computing stocks, and drone stocks. Some of these stocks had gone parabolic and a number of them came public recently. So a good dose of profit taking certainly makes sense. The FOMO and YOLO trades are great when they are working, but you better have a finger on the sell button or massive gains can disappear just as fast as they occurred. (Mark Arbeter, CMT)
