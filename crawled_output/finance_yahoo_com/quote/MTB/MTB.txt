Argus Quick Note: Weekly Stock List for 07/07/2025: Lingering High Rates
President Trump can make demands and data aggregators can analyze the odds. But Wall Street, corporate America, and consumers are still facing high interest rates. The fed funds rate is now targeting 4.25%-4.5%. Sure, rates have come down from their recent highs in the 1.5 years -- but not nearly at the pace that most economists expected. Many of them forecast four rate cuts in 2025. But at the halfway mark of the year, we have yet to see one and the current consensus is for two cuts, at best. Argus is in that camp and has been since 1Q25. Our Fixed Income Strategist Kevin Heal believes that the Federal Reserve wants to lower its target rate, but is being patient and prudent until there is greater clarity on the impact of tariffs. Given the stubbornness of rates, we turn back to the sectors that tend to do well in an elevated-rate climate. Here is a list of industries and companies that we believe should benefit from a sustained period of higher interest rates. All are BUY-rated at Argus.
