Stocks are mixed at Monday midday with the Nasdaq making a push
Stocks are mixed at Monday midday with the Nasdaq making a push higher and other indices mostly flat. The market is expressing confidence that a rate cut is coming next week when the Federal Reserve meets. The big question is will the cut be 25 basis points or 50 basis points. We have two big inflation reports coming this week, CPI and PPI, that might solidify the answer. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note is 4.08%. Crude oil is at $63 per barrel.

A key focus for Bristol is immuno-oncology, where the firm is a leader in drug development. Bristol derives close to 70% of total sales from the US, showing a higher dependence on the US market than most of its peer group.
