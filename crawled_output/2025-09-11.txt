Picture of the day
The Austin J. Tobin Plaza was a large public square that was located on the World Trade Center site from 1966 until its destruction in 2001 during the September 11 attacks. It covered five acres (220,000 sq ft; 2.0 ha), making it the largest plaza in New York City by acreage at the time. The plaza opened as part of the original World Trade Center complex on April 4, 1973, and was renamed in 1982 after Austin J. Tobin, a former executive director of the Port of New York Authority. The plaza was damaged by a car bomb in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, and was destroyed by Islamist terrorists from al-Qaeda eight years later on September 11, 2001. This photograph, taken in 1976 by the Hungarian-American photographer Balthazar Korab, shows an elevated view of the Austin J. Tobin Plaza as seen from 5 World Trade Center. The Sphere and Ideogram, two of several public sculptures in the plaza, are visible in the image.Photograph credit: Balthazar Korab
