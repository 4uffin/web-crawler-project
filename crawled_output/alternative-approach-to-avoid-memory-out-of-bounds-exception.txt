I was wondering if there are any other approaches to avoid Memory out of bounds exception. Currently the code is written as
await blob.DownloadToAsync(memoryStream)
memorystream.position=0
Using streamReader reader = new streamReader(memoryStream))
string data = reader.ReadtoEnd()
The file which I'm trying to process is large with a size of 167 MB.

1. What is blob? Does it have a streaming API (I'm quite sure that it should)? 2. Do you need to process as a single string?

Without knowing why you want all the data as a string, this is hard to answer - because the first step in any non-trivial data processing scenario is "don't do that". So: what is the purpose of this string, and could this be reworked to use progressive processing, so you don't buffer everything. Alternatively, could you buffer on disk?

If blob is an Azure blob for example, you have OpenRead and OpenReadAsync methods, so you don't have to download it first, you can open a stream over it directly

If you want just to prevent crash, you can add try/catch statement catching either that specific exception or just all with catch(Exception ex)

Please post a minimal reproducible example (this code wouldn't compile at all, so it's clearly not your actual code) - and the actual exception name... I don't think "memory out of bounds" exception exists.
