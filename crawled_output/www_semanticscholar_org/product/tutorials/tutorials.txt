With billions of citations, Semantic Scholar provides a citation graph that allows scholars to navigate and discover the most relevant research across all fields of study. We offer many ways to explore our citation graph, including our novel method of classifying citations by type and influence, as well as searching citations.Our system indexes billions of citations, using AI models to classify the intent and predict the influence of each. We’ve identified three classification types; cites background, cites methods, and cites results. You can find citation type by scrolling to the citations listed for any paper and using the citation type filter to identify papers that cites background, cites methods, or cites results.While many citations are incidental, Semantic Scholar classifies some citations as being “Highly Influential,” allowing scholars to quickly determine which publications to read in depth. Find highly influenced citations sorting by Most Influenced Papers or scanning for the Highly Influenced paper badge under each paper title.Searching citations of a paper helps researchers quickly navigate through a large list of citations and narrow results down to the most relevant. To get the most out of this feature, search for a keyword in the paper title, filter by date range, citation or publication type, author, or, filter by a specific conference or field of study. You can also sort by relevance, most influenced papers, citation count, or recency.Explore citations to discover new research on semanticscholar.org."101: SearchNavigate through millions of scientific papers in all fields of study by searching our corpus.In this video learn search best practices like:Selecting 'Field of Study' to find literature from a particular domainSpecifying a date range or select 'This Year' to find the most recent literatureRefining results further by choosing a Publication Type, Authors, or Journals and Conferences View TranscriptHide Transcript"Semantic Scholar is an AI-powered search and discovery tool used by millions of scholars globally each month, and supports hundreds of thousands of scholarly searches each week.Our mission is to empower researchers to fight information overload.
