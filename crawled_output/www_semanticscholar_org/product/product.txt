We are here to support you by providing a better way to search and discover scientific knowledge.SearchFind Relevant ResearchSearch over 214 million papers from all fields of science, with filters such as journals and conferences, authors, publication types, and date range.Scan Papers Faster with TLDRsIdentifying the right papers for you can be time-consuming. To save some time, look for TLDRs (Too Long; Didn't Read) on search results pages.‍TLDRs are super-short summaries of the main objective and results of a paper, generated using expert background knowledge and NLP techniques, available for nearly 60 million papers in computer science, biology, and medicine.Check Highly Influential CitationsToo many citations to wade through? Start with the Highly Influential Citations where the cited publication has a significant impact on the citing publication, determined by a machine-learning model that analyzes factors including the number of citations to a publication and the surrounding context for each.Search NowCiteCite Any PaperAny paper you find relevant for your research, select "Cite" on a paper page or in the search results. A pop-up will offer you the option of multiple citation formats including BibTex, MLA, APA, or Chicago.LibraryManage Your Papers in One PlaceStore and organize all the papers that interest you in your online library and access them anywhere, anytime when you sign in to Semantic Scholar. With your library, you can organize papers into customized folders and bulk export citations. You can also create public folders and easily share them with collaborators, who can copy the folder to their own library in one click.After creating a folder, you can also create AI-powered Research Feeds that automatically generate paper recommendations for you. Simply toggle the Research Feed to ‘On’ for each folder and you will start receiving regular recommendations from the next day.Pro Tip: Place similar papers into one folder to generate better and more relevant recommendations.Visit LibraryResearch FeedsPersonalized AI-Powered Paper RecommendationsAfter you add papers to your library, your Research Feeds will quickly learn what papers interest you and recommend the latest research to help you stay up-to-date.You can turn on Research Feeds recommendations for any folder in your library and have them sent right to your email. To learn more about how Research Feeds work, visit our FAQ.Tips to Get Better RecommendationsRatings are essential to teach Semantic Scholar’s AI what is or isn't relevant to you. The more ratings you submit, the more relevant your recommended papers will be.Add 5 relevant papers to a library folder. Semantic Scholar will show you papers similar to these.Mark 3 non-relevant papers as "not relevant" in the corresponding Research Feed, and Semantic Scholar will show you fewer papers similar to these.Visit Research FeedsAlertsGet Notified for New Papers or CitationsNo need to refresh the page every day.

As it becomes more reliable, I fully expect these author pages to serve as a richer "contributor dashboard" that is more informative than a CV or other current attribution mechanisms.Matthew AkamatsuSemantic Scholar userJordi ChanovasSemantic Scholar userResearch feeds helped me maintain up-to-date with the latest findings related with my research. Email alerts kept me aware of new articles in my research feed. Finally, TLDR uses AI to give a summarised version of publications which makes the decision of whether a publication is relevant or not to the field easier than ever.Through the influential citations, I can know the follow-up progress of this work and follow up the latest progress of this research. Research feeds is very useful for me to understand the relevant literature in the field and broaden my horizons. TLDR allows me to quickly understand the content of this paper and saves my time and energy.MountainSemantic Scholar userMark FriedmanSemantic Scholar userSemantic Scholar appears to be very focused on the needs of people like me that want to be able to keep up with current research on specific topics (as defined by our explicit and implicit selections).Join Our Beta ProgramInterested in upcoming new features?Join our Beta Program to provide feedback and help scholars around the globe.Learn MoreExperience a smarter way to search and discover scholarly research.Create Your AccountStay Connected With Semantic Scholar
