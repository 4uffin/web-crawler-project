If you’re logged-in, Semantic Reader integrates with your library and, over time, will incorporate personalized contextual augmentations as well.A Revolutionary Reading ExperienceSemantic Reader is now available for most arXiv papers on Semantic Scholar with a growing set of features.Citations Cards that show details of a cited paper in-line where you’re reading, including TLDR summariesTable of Contents to quickly navigate between sections (availability varies)Save to Library to conveniently track your reading listPersonalized In-line CitationsWith the volume and variety of citations during literature review, it can be challenging to prioritize which ones to explore. In Semantic Reader, citations within a paper are visually augmented based on their connections to your research activities, such as saved in your library or cited by a paper in your library.If you have at least one paper in your library, this feature is available on desktop devices for you!
