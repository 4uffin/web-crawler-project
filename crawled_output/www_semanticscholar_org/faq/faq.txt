Possible errors include:Factual inaccuracies. Most of these will be subtle, but some may be serious factual errorsAwkwardly phrased answersIrrelevant informationWhile we generally found models to be accurate, you should verify the accuracy of generated text whenever possible.Features that use generative AI include:Ask This PaperGenerative Term UnderstandingText LinkHow are questions answered by Ask This Paper?We query OpenAI’s gpt3.5-turbo-16k with the content of the current paper alongside your question; the model returns an answer, along with one or more supporting statements from the paper. We find the closest text to snippets in the original paper and display it to you alongside the model answer. Note that our system has only been tested on English-language papers and is available on a subset of papers.Text LinkWhat kinds of questions can Ask This Paper handle?Ask This Paper is designed to work on questions which can be answered by the current paper. There are a few predefined questions that we find generally work well, however, we encourage you to try new questions. We are always learning more about the abilities of this experimental system.Questions you can try:What is the goal of this paper?What are the key results of this paper?What methods are used?How is the system evaluated?What is the baseline condition?How did the paper differentiate the proposed approach with prior work?Text LinkHow are terms defined in the Semantic Reader?When you click on an underlined term in the Semantic Reader, we ask ChatGPT to provide a definition for the given term in the context it appears in.Text LinkWhich terms are definable in the Semantic Reader?We identify scientific terms by extracting noun-phrases from the text. We filter these noun-phrases using methods inspired by this paper, plus some hand-tuned rules-based filtering.Text LinkWhat are Topic pages?Topics are phrases in research papers that are often accompanied by citations. Topic pages aim to help scholars quickly understand a field by synthesizing concepts from several papers that mention or explain the topic with generative AI, including:Definition of the topicRelated topicsPapers often cited for this topicRecent papers that mention this topicText LinkWhy don’t I see topics for a paper I’m interested in?Currently, only topics in the Computer Science field are available. To see if a topic is available, you can directly search for it from the search bar on any Topic page.Text LinkHow are Topic pages generated?We use large language models (LLMs) to extract a list of topics from the title and abstract of a paper. Subsequently, we leverage these models to generate definitions and descriptions using relevant snippets from the single most cited paper for a topic.AlertsText LinkWhat is the benefit of receiving email alerts from Semantic Scholar?Creating email alerts helps to stay up-to-date on authors, papers, and topics in your field of study. Email alerts are a tool for tracking the latest developments in your field and enable you to survey and assess the impact of research available on Semantic Scholar.Text LinkWhat type of alerts does Semantic Scholar offer?Author Alerts: New citations and papers for a specific author to assess the author’s impact.Paper Alerts: New citations for a specific paper to keep track of how it is impacting related research.Topic Alerts: New papers that mention a research topic to stay up-to-date on the latest papers in a given research field.Research Feed Alerts: New papers based on your Research Feed ratings.Text LinkHow do I create an alert?To create a new alert for an author, visit the author page for the author you’re interested in. In the left panel below the author's name, select Create Alert. Choose whether you wish to create an alert for new citations or newly published papers for that author. Confirm by selecting Create Alert.To create an alert for a paper or topic, visit the paper or topic page you’re interested in. Select Create Alert located below the paper abstract or select Create Alert located below the topic description.When you create a research feed, you will automatically receive email alerts once you rate five relevant papers with More Like This and three non-relevant papers with Less Like This.Text LinkHow do I edit my alert preferences?To edit your alerts preferences:Sign in to your Semantic Scholar account.Under 'Account' in the top right corner, select Settings from the dropdown menu.Under 'General Settings,' select Alert Preferences.Select Alert Email Address to specify where you would like to receive email alerts.

Note: Published academic articles and preprints  are our primary focus. Book coverage is very limited and patents are not included. Because of this, you may notice differences in counts when comparing against other websites.Our site features over two billion citations and we’re continuously working to add citation data through enhanced PDF extraction models and publisher partnerships. With new content added on a daily basis, citation counts will continue to increase.Text LinkHow does Semantic Scholar calculate H-index?Semantic Scholar's h-index is calculated using citation data based on the publications and citations currently discoverable on semanticscholar.org. Because of this, you may notice differences in scores when comparing against other websites. Note: Our corpus currently focuses on published academic articles and preprints; book coverage is very limited and patents are not included. Also, some publishers do not openly share reference data (visit I4OC to advocate for the open sharing of reference data).Important: An h-index should be used as a single indicator only and not as a comprehensive and comparative measure of overall scientific impact. Due to variations in publication and citation rates across fields and because the h-index does not account for career progression, Semantic Scholar does not recommend using the h-index for comparative analysis or research assessment.Text LinkWhat are Highly Influential Citations?Semantic Scholar identifies citations where the cited publication has a significant impact on the citing publication, making it easier to understand how publications build upon and relate to each other. Influential citations are determined utilizing a machine-learning model analyzing a number of factors including the number of citations to a publication, and the surrounding context for each. You can read more about our approach in “Identifying Meaningful Citations”.Note: Identification as highly influential relies on our access to the full-text of the citing paper. Our publisher partnerships and open access PDF extraction provide strong coverage; however, some influential papers may not be designated as such due full-text access limitations.Text LinkWhat is Citation Velocity?Citation Velocity is a weighted average of the publication’s citations for the last 3 years and fewer for publications published in the last year or two, which indicates how popular and lasting the publication is.Text LinkWhat is Citation Acceleration?Citation acceleration measures the change in a publication’s citation velocity over time, indicating whether the number of citations for a publication is increasing or decreasing. We divide the change in citation velocity over the last two years to calculate citation acceleration.Text LinkWhat is Citation Intent?Citation intents make it easier for researchers to navigate and discover research while browsing our citation graph. We categorize citation intents into three different types; Background, Method and Result Extension.Background citations provide historical context, justification of importance, and/or additional information directly related to that which exists in a cited paper.Method citations use the previously established procedures or experiments to determine whether the results are consistent with findings in related studies.Result citations extend on findings from research that was previously conducted.Note: citation intent data is limited to papers for which we have access to the full text.If you'd like to learn more about how we're identifying citation intent in scholarly literature, visit “Structural Scaffolds for Citation Intent Classification in Scientific Publications”.Text LinkHow do I cite publications that I find on Semantic Scholar?To cite any papers that you find on Semantic Scholar, select Cite below the title and authors listed on a paper page or in the search results. A pop-up will offer you the option of multiple citation formats including BibTex, MLA, APA or Chicago.To download an EndNote .enw file, select EndNote.To import a citation using a reference management software browser plugin such as Zotero Connector or Mendeley Web Importer, navigate to the paper's page in Semantic Scholar and then select your reference manager's extension in your browser. Please note that when using Zotero Connector, you may need to refresh the paper's page to enable importing.Text LinkDoes Semantic Scholar display the online publication date or the print publication date?Semantic Scholar displays either the print or online publication date depending on metadata that's provided by the source.ContentText LinkWhere does Semantic Scholar source papers from?Semantic Scholar sources its content via web indexing and from partnerships with scientific journals, indexes, and content providers.

If you prefer not to claim the page, contact us with the URL to the paper on Semantic Scholar and we will remove the paper from the author page.Text LinkDo you provide papers that are behind paywalls?We provide open access options where available; however, some articles are only available on the publisher's site behind paywalls.Text LinkDoes Semantic Scholar include papers in other languages than English?We currently focus on publications primarily in English, but we hope to support other languages in the future.Text LinkWhat is a Lit Review and how do you determine that a paper is an overview?Lit reviews are papers that provide a survey or high-level explanation of a field or topic. Our system utilizes a series of heuristics to determine if a paper is classified as an overview by analyzing the document’s content and wording.Text LinkI’d like to have an author page on Semantic Scholar. What can I do?Author pages are created automatically. Once Semantic Scholar discovers a publicly accessible publication on the internet, metadata is then extracted from the publication source and an author page is automatically created based on that metadata.Text LinkHow does Semantic Scholar determine a paper’s Field of Study?Semantic Scholar assigns Field of Study using a machine learning classification model based on a paper’s title and abstract. A paper may be assigned up to three Fields of Study. Field of Study classification is currently limited to English-language papers. It is most reliable when both title and abstract are available, but works on just titles as well. If a paper’s title is too ambiguous, it may not be assigned any Field of Study. To learn more about Field of Study classification on Semantic Scholar, see our blog post.Text LinkHow do I open PDF files in a new tab rather than automatically download?Papers may automatically be downloaded to your device based on your browser settings.
