How to bulk load CSV file in mySQL workbench without import wizard?

I am trying to write a stored procedure to import CSV data from local system to mySQL tables. I do not want to use import wizard as I want SP to create, import and display time taken to import.
However, when I execute this statement:
LOAD DATA INFILE 'path/to/your/file.csv' INTO TABLE your_table_name FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' ENCLOSED BY '"' LINES TERMINATED BY '\n' IGNORE 1 LINES; -- Use this if your file has a header row
I receive Error Code: 1290. The MySQL server is running with the --secure-file-priv option so it cannot execute this statement.
Things I have tried:
Transfer files to path in secure_file_priv C:\ProgramData\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\Uploads\
Updated 'secure_file_priv'="" and 'local_infile'=1 in my.ini file at various locations, getting default file location from cmd, but the path is not updated when I check their updated values.
I restart mySQL server each time after making changes but no luck.
Unchecked Safe updates in mySQL preferences
Please let me know any workaround.

Yep, these are the possible solutions for this behaviour. If neither worked, then you probably made a mistake in implementing those solutions. Please show the exact load data statement with the file path C:\ProgramData\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\Uploads\ and what error message you got when you tried it.

1. Use LOAD DATA **LOCAL** INFILE
If you want to read from your local machine, not the server’s upload directory, enable local_infile and use the LOCAL keyword:
LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE 'C:/path/to/your/file.csv'
INTO TABLE your_table_name
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
ENCLOSED BY '"'
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
IGNORE 1 LINES;
Make sure local_infile=1 is enabled in both server and client.
In Workbench, go to Edit → Preferences → SQL Editor → Enable LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE. Restart Workbench after enabling.
2. Use the secure_file_priv directory
If you want to stick with LOAD DATA INFILE (no LOCAL), you must place the file inside the directory allowed by secure_file_priv.
Check it with:
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'secure_file_priv';
Copy your CSV there, then:
LOAD DATA INFILE 'C:/ProgramData/MySQL/MySQL Server 8.0/Uploads/file.csv'
INTO TABLE your_table_name
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
ENCLOSED BY '"'
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
IGNORE 1 LINES;
3. If you want this inside a Stored Procedure
Wrap the LOAD DATA in dynamic SQL:
DELIMITER //
CREATE PROCEDURE import_csv()
BEGIN
SET @sql = "
LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE 'C:/path/to/your/file.csv'
INTO TABLE your_table_name
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
ENCLOSED BY '\"'
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
IGNORE 1 LINES
";
PREPARE stmt FROM @sql;
EXECUTE stmt;
DEALLOCATE PREPARE stmt;
END //
DELIMITER ;
Then call:
CALL import_csv();
Recommended: If you’re running Workbench locally, the simplest fix is to enable local_infile and use LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE. That avoids the secure_file_priv restriction entirely.

Unfortunately, this answer just rehashes the lot of other general answers to this error. However, it is clear from the OP's post that they have done their research and found the generic answers. They need help to tweak their solutions so that one of those work.
