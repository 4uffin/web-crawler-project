Reminded me of the “bonsai kitten” hoax of the 90s, maybe one of the first mass outrage events on the WWW.If I recall correctly, it was an MIT student prank. This looks to be an early copy:https://public.websites.umich.edu/~rsc/Humour/www.bonsaikitt...replybdcravens 6 hours ago

That was literally the first thing I thought of when I saw the link. We're old lolreplydanhau 9 hours ago

This is exactly the kind of thing the internet was made to share for. Made me lol. But I can‘t help thinking that the cat will eventually get bored of the fish it can‘t eat, and the you end up with a weird looking aquarium.replytim333 5 hours ago

Cat's have remarkable persistence at watching potential prey. I don't think ours ever stopped taking an interest.replyngruhn 9 hours ago

True :P On the other hand, laser pointers seem endlessly entertaining.replyndsipa_pomu 8 hours ago

I've heard that excessive laser pointer chasing is cruel as the cat activates their hunting instinct, but is never able to catch it leading to a build up of frustration.replynoir_lord 6 hours ago

Place a treat out the way but where you can hit it with the laser, play with them for 10-15 and then point it at the treat and as the cat arrives kill the laser.replylatexr 8 hours ago

Can confirm, both from experience and consulting with veterinaries. Don’t play with cats with laser pointers. Had one cat who became so obsessed (and we didn’t even play that long) that for years afterwards would react to any light reflection, like the sun bouncing of the phone screen and onto the wall. Thankfully it subsided significantly later in life, but it took a lot of care and vigilance.replyquesera 7 hours ago

I suspect this is bunk -- the vast majority of feline stalking sessions in nature are unsuccessful, and these are often motivated by hunger, so failure is more meaningful than it would be for a domestic cat. Also, how does one measure feline frustration? Cortisol levels? Brain activity? Is it distinguishable from the stress/excitement of the hunt?Regardless, my approach has been to start by putting together one of those 3V lithium battery LED assemblies, wrapping it up in clear tape, and hiding it under the dog bed. This takes about 30 seconds of preparation.Then I run the cats around with the laser pointer for a few minutes, and finally let them watch the dot "hide" under the dog bed, so that they reach in and pull out their prize.Which they then attack for a few seconds, but lose interest in pretty quickly, because it doesn't run away or smell edible. But their predator success desire is met, I think.This chase-catch-abandon cycle is their MO for flying bugs and mice as well, FWIW. They seem to enjoy it, although I am not sure it's any easier to measure feline pleasure than feline frustration.replywillseth 3 hours ago

Our vet told us it is far more important that house cats get exercise than any potential frustration caused by a laser pointer.replysecretsatan 49 minutes ago

That’s def not the laser, most cats will play with light reflections if they’ve seen a laser pointer or, i did this as a kid pre laser pointer age.
I would say the laser pointer at least works without sunlight.replydoright 6 hours ago

My understanding is this is 100% true for dogs but not for cats, and the reason for the difference in level of obsession is unclear.replymikestew 6 hours ago

We’ve got a rescue dog like that, reflections off watches or whatever (including kitchen baking sheets). It genuinely distresses him. Dog was seven years old when we got him, probably no fixing it now, but we do try to mitigate things as best we can.In his particular case, his hunting instinct doesn’t help, I’m sure. He’s a pit bull, but that speckled neck and feet tells me that there’s some Spaniel in there somewhere.replygliptic 5 hours ago

This doesn't really make sense to me. Most cats I've known react to such reflections without ever having seen a laser pointer in their life, for the same reason they react to laser pointers.replyModernMech 6 hours ago

I feel this is just a cat being a cat. Cats are hardwired to chase any small thing moving quickly. Their eyes are great at detecting contrast, and a bright light has a lot of contrast to interest a cat. They chase it because they don't really understand it's not prey and just a reflection. That the cat lost interest as it got older is perhaps it just being old and less exuberant.replyyardstick 8 hours ago

Can’t the cat just sit directly beside the fish tank and watch?replykijin 5 hours ago

Cats seem to prefer sitting in enclosed spaces, like a cardboard box.replyFraterkes 8 hours ago

Ive always been taught that fish bowls are cruel because they leave the fish feeling really exposed and stressed. Wouldn’t this create the same effect?replywzdd 6 hours ago
| parent | next [–]
Bowls specifically are worse than large, filtered, rectangular aquariums because they're typically too small (causing stress), unfiltered (resulting in waste buildup which causes stress), round (which can act as a lens if the bowl is small, which provides an unnatural, constantly-changing view which causes stress, and which also offers no corner to hide in or rest), and open at the top (so things can fall in, fish can leap out, and cats can attempt to catch them).replypetesergeant 8 hours ago

If that was true, I feel like it would be surprising that fish towers/elevators/view-tubes often fill with fish.replykomali2 6 hours ago

Perhaps after they go from vibrant and living to floating upside down shortly afterward, is a good indication.replytempodox 6 hours ago

> Enhances cognitive functionI wonder how they arrived at that.
Do I have to expect my cat to start talking, “Cut the BS and give me the fish already”?Still, I was pleasantly surprised.

Please do not tap on the glass. It distresses the fish, and gives the cat ideas.replymoffkalast 8 hours ago

Hmm, aren't cat eyes largely unable to focus on objects less than 30cm/12inch away? I wonder if this is more like colourful a blur to them.replytrolleybus 6 hours ago

I'm a bit perplexed: the "Bottom Entrance Cat Aquarium" looks like a fucking trap to stun and kill the cat with its own carbon dioxide...replyNormal_gaussian 6 hours ago

carbon dioxide is heavier than air; the holes are in the bottom. The cat will be fine.replyp1mrx 6 hours ago

The cat jumps up through a hole in the bottom of the table.reply
