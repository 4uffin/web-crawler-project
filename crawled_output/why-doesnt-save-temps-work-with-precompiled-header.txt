Why doesn't -save-temps work with precompiled header?

In my project I have done in CMake:
target_precompile_headers(${main_target_name} PRIVATE
std_pch.h
)
target_compile_options(${main_target_name} PRIVATE -save-temps)
Save temps cannot work if I add that precompiled header. I get the error:
fatal error: 'iostream' file not found
4 | #include <iostream>
This is in Clang. In GCC 14 it doesn't seem to work, but it seems for another reason, -save-temps is buggy overall because I get a compiler segmentation fault. Is there something fundamentally incompatible with both precompiled headers and -save-temps? It appears in the Clang case it's an error of include directories, ie.,
cannot be found.
