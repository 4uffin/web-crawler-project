“[The Court’s exhibit program] communicates to all Americans a sense of the story of the Supreme Court as a living institution, and in that process to add warmth and humanity
to the building itself.”
– Chief Justice Warren E. Burger
The Office of the Curator creates exhibitions on the history of the Supreme Court, the Justices, and the work of the Court. All exhibitions are located on the
ground floor, and are self-guided.
