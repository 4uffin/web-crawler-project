Visiting the Court
Home to the Supreme Court of the United States since 1935, the building located at 1 First Street NE serves as a symbol of the Supreme Court’s importance as a coequal,
independent branch of government. It is a federal workplace, the setting for oral arguments, and a space where visitors from all over the world can come to learn
more about the judicial branch of the United States and the nation’s highest Court.
The Supreme Court Building is open Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. It is closed on weekends and all federal holidays. Admission is free. Visitors should be aware that
the business of the Court may affect public access to the building and visitor programs. Please check Today at the Court on the homepage for the Court’s daily calendar.
Visitors may view the public portions of the building on a self-guided basis and take advantage of a variety of educational programs, including Courtroom Lectures, and Court-related
Exhibitions.
Court sessions, including the handing down of opinions, are also open to the public. See Oral Arguments for more information.
