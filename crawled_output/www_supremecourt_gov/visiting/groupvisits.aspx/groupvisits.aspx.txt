Group Visits
Getting ready for a Supreme Court visit means planning the logistics as well as preparing students and other groups for what they will see and do. Visitors may view public portions of the building on a self-guided basis and take advantage of a variety of educational activities, including Court-related Exhibitions and Courtroom Lectures (offered at set times when Court is not in session. Please check the 30-day rolling calendar).
Building highlights include the Courtroom and Great Hall, which are located on the first floor. Ground floor highlights include the John Marshall statue, portraits and busts of former Justices, exhibitions, and two self-supporting spiral staircases.
All visitors and groups should review the Visitor Guidelines prior to visiting.
Building Hours
The Supreme Court Building is open Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. The building is closed on weekends and all federal holidays. Visitors should be aware that the business of the Court may affect public access to the building and visitor programs. Please check Today at the Court on the homepage for the Court’s daily calendar.
Transportation
The Supreme Court is not accessible by private bus or passenger van. Please view the map to see designated bus routes and restrictions. Street parking is also extremely limited near the Supreme Court. The closest public parking garage is located at Union Station (0.5 miles away). The closest Metro stops are Capitol South (Blue, Orange, and Silver lines - 0.3 miles away) and Union Station (Red line - 0.5 miles away).
Entering the Building
The Supreme Court is located at 1 First Street NE between East Capitol Street and Maryland Avenue, across from the U.S. Capitol and next to the Library of Congress. Visitors’ entrances are located to the left and right of the main steps on the plaza level. An accessible entrance is located along Maryland Avenue on the north side of the building. For more information about building accessibility, please see the Accessibility webpage.
Security Screening
Prior to entering, all visitors and their belongings must pass through security screening. Review the Prohibited Items List in advance to ensure more efficient screening. Lines to enter the building may be longer during the months of March through June, when visitation numbers are typically highest. When visiting during the spring or summer months, groups may find it helpful to carry as little as possible and afford at least 30 extra minutes for screening.
Avoiding Crowds
Visitation is typically busiest from March through June, so if you are looking to avoid crowds, the best time to plan a school or group visit is typically during the fall and winter months (September to February).
Café & Vending Machines
The Supreme Court Café,
located on the ground floor across from the gift shop, offers a variety of breakfast selections, hot and cold sandwiches, wraps, soup, salads, pizzas, grab-n-go meals, snacks, and beverages, including Starbucks® hand-crafted beverages. The Café is open to the public from 9 a.m. until 3 p.m., Monday to Friday. Items other than grab-n-go should be ordered using the electronic kiosks. Vending machines serving snacks and beverages are also available on the ground floor during regular hours of operation. Please contact Supreme Court Café for information about arranging lunch for your group.

The 30-minute itinerary can be adapted for any start time between 9 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. The 60-minute itineraries can be adapted for a 10:00 a.m., 11:00 a.m., 12:00 p.m., 1:00 p.m., or 2:00 p.m. start time. The 90-minute itineraries can be adapted for a 10:00 a.m., 11:00 a.m., 12:00 p.m., or 1:00 p.m. start time.
