Original Jurisdiction Records & Briefs
The Supreme Court Library is in the process of digitizing its collection of Records & Briefs within the Court's original jurisdiction. Original jurisdiction cases are those that are filed in the Supreme Court in the first instance, without being resolved by another state or federal court. The Court's original jurisdiction is established in Article III, Section 2, Clause 2 of the Constitution, and in Section 1251 of Title 28 of the United States Code.
The first group of original case briefs that have been digitized and made available here - numbered 1 through 147 - are those that were active on the Court's docket at some point between 1962 and implementation of the Court's electronic filing system in November 2017. Prior to the 1962 Term, the Clerk's Office regularly renumbered original cases, which meant that many original cases from this time period had different case numbers over the course of their existence. There were eleven cases on the Court's original docket in 1962 when the Clerk's Office began the practice of giving each original case a unique and permanent case number. Those eleven cases were then given permanent numbers (No. 1 through No. 11), and each subsequently filed case was given a higher number. Original cases 148 and higher were all filed since implementation of the Court's electronic filing system, so filings in those cases are available on the Court's regular docket and are not included in this collection.
The collection here is a digitized version of the physical collection in the Supreme Court's Library and may not contain all records and briefs that were filed in a given case. This collection will be updated in the future with cases that were filed and resolved prior to 1961.
