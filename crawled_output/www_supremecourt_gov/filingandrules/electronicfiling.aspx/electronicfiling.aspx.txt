Electronic Filing
Paper remains the official form of filing at the Supreme Court. In addition, parties who are represented by counsel must submit electronic versions
of filings through the electronic filing system. Documents that are submitted electronically will be made available on the Court’s public docket free of charge. Filings from
pro se parties are submitted only on paper, but will be scanned and made available electronically on the Court’s docket. Additional information
about the system is available in the documents below. Any other questions on these issues can be directed to the Clerk’s Office at 202-479-5660
or efilingsupport@supremecourt.gov.
Attorneys who have registered for the system are asked to verify contact information to ensure accuracy. Once logged into the system, click on
“My Account” at the top of the screen, then access and correct information contained in the “My Profile,”
“Addresses,” and “Email Addresses” tabs.
