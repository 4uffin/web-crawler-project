Orders by Circuit - Term Year 2024
The vast majority of cases filed in the Supreme Court are disposed of summarily by unsigned orders.
Such an order will, for example, deny a petition for certiorari without comment. Regularly scheduled
lists of orders are issued on each Monday that the Court sits. The order lists below have been organized
by Circuit. Under each Circuit heading is the Supreme Court case number and in parenthesis the lower
court’s case number. Scheduled order lists are posted on this website on the day of their issuance.
Caution: These electronic orders may contain computer-generated errors or other deviations
from the official printed versions.
