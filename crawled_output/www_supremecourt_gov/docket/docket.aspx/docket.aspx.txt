Docket Search
The Supreme Court’s docket system contains information about cases, both pending and decided, that have been filed at the Court. The docket provided
here contains complete information regarding the status of cases filed since the beginning of the 2001 Term.
Users can search for the docket in a particular case by using a Supreme Court docket number, a case name, or other words or numbers included on a docket
report. The format for Supreme Court docket numbers is "Term year-number" (e.g., 21-471; 22-5301).
Users can also sign up to receive email notifications of activity in pending cases. To do so, visit the docket page for an individual case and click on
the envelope icon that is just above the case number. You will be asked to enter an email address. When you click “Subscribe,” an email will be sent to
you with a link for you to confirm the correct email address. Once you click that link, you will receive email notifications every time there is a new
filing or action by the Court in the case.

clicking on the blue “Questions Presented” hyperlink located on the left side of the docket report. Once the hyperlink is clicked, a .pdf file setting
forth the Questions Presented in the case will appear.
