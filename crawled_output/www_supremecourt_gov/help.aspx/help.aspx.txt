Tips for Users
Navigation
Site Map
The Site Map provides an overview of the organization of the site.
Site-Wide Navigation
Use the links in the navigational area at the left of each page to move among the topic areas of the Supreme Court web site. To return to the supremecourt.gov home page from anywhere, use the words "home" and the Supreme Court graphic at the top left of each page. You may also use the Back button at the top of your browser.
Back Button
In most cases, you may use your browser's "Back" button to return to a page you previously visited.  Also, there is the concept of "breadcrumbs" (example, Home, Tips for User) located just under the banner area. So you can step back through the links that placed you in a specific location on the site.
External Sites
In most cases, when a hyperlink takes you off the Supreme Court web site, you will see a message informing you of this.
Tools
Site Search
Using the search feature in the right side of the header on each page, you can search the Supreme Court web site or Docket files by entering key words.
File Formats
PDF Files (Acrobat)
Some documents on the Supreme Court web site are in Portable Document Format (PDF). These cross-platform documents ensure that users will be able to obtain publications in their original format regardless of what platform, software, or configurations they use to access the Internet. In order to view PDF documents, however, users must first download the free Acrobat Reader software, which lets you view, navigate through, and print PDF documents. Detailed instructions for downloading and installing the Acrobat Reader are available at http://get.adobe.com/reader/. If you are not able to complete the indicated procedure, a Troubleshooting guide is available. For best results, make sure you have installed version 4.0 or later of the Acrobat Reader.
Video/Audio Files
These files require HTML5 supported web browsers - minimum of Chrom 4.0, Edge 9.0, Firefox 3.5, Safari 4.0, or Opera 10.5. These file formats allows us to "stream" audio and video files to users, which means that you will begin hearing and seeing the files without having to wait for the entire file to download. (Note that to hear audio on your computer, your system must also have a sound card and speakers or earphones.)
Accessibility
PDF Files
The PDFs on this web site have been processed with the MakeAccessible Plug-in from Adobe Systems Incorporated. This plug-in creates a tagged PDF from one that is untagged, which makes the PDF accessible by screen readers. Please note that this plug-in is known to have some limitations related to font encodings, tables recognition, complex recognition, and layer order.
