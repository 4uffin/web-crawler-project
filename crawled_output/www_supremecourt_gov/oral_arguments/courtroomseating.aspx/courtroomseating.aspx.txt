Courtroom Seating
All oral arguments are open to the public, but seating is limited. The Court is currently conducting a pilot program in which members of the public may apply for
Courtroom seating through an online lottery. During the pilot program, Courtroom seating will also be available to the public on a first-come, first-seated basis. Before a session begins, a line forms on the sidewalk on East Capitol Street adjacent to the Court building. Please do not hold a space for others who have not yet arrived.
Seating for the first argument begins at 9:30 a.m. The Supreme Court Building will otherwise be closed to the public when the Court is in session. There is a police officer on duty
to answer your questions.
Visitors should be aware that cases may attract large crowds, with lines forming before the building opens. Obviously there are unavoidable delays associated with processing and seating
large numbers of visitors, and your cooperation and patience are appreciated. Court police officers will make every effort to inform you as soon as possible whether you can expect to
secure a seat in the Courtroom.
Before entering the Supreme Court Building, all visitors are screened by a magnetometer and all personal belongings are screened by an x-ray machine. To ensure the safety of visitors and staff
and to preserve the collections, facilities, and historic building and grounds, please see the list of items strictly prohibited inside the
building and in the Courtroom while Court is in session.
We do not recommend taking infants or young children into the Courtroom.
When the Court adjourns, all persons must leave the Courtroom and the Great Hall. If there is an afternoon oral argument, persons attending the afternoon session must line up again
in front of the building to gain admission.
