I want to reverse the direction of the slotreel, As of Now it is from bottom to top.
but when I am reversing the direction it is creating gap on the top feels like stretching it,
Below is the code snippet , consider slotItem as just any text lets say but the problem is when I am reversing the direction it creates gap at the top, My aim to stop the movement of reel smoothly after 9-10 seconds when I found the result like it can be any of them , so from bottom to top it creates illusion but from top to bottom , it could not and as a result it shows gap at the top, so what could be done , any other better approach please !
